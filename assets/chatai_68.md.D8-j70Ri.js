First, let's find the monthly interest amount based on the 7-day interest provided: The interest for 7 days is Rs. 180.83. To find the interest for a full month (30 days), we can use the following proportion: 7 days : 30 days = Rs. 180.83 : X Where X is the interest for 30 days. Now, we can solve for X: X = (Rs. 180.83 * 30 days) / 7 days X = Rs. 774.21 (approximately) This is the interest amount for a month on the fixed deposit of Rs. 10000 at 9.5% per month. Now, let's find the interest rate on the loan per month. We know that the monthly interest amount on the loan is Rs. 774.21. We can use the formula for simple interest to find the rate: Interest (I) = Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T) Where: I = Rs. 774.21 P = Rs. 15000 T = 1 month (since we are looking for the monthly rate) Now, we can solve for R: R = I / (P * T) R = Rs. 774.21 / (Rs. 15000 * 1) R = 0.051614 (approximately) To express R as a percentage, we multiply by 100: R = 0.051614 * 100 R = 5.1614% Therefore, the interest rate on the loan per month is approximately boxed{5.1614%} ."},{"prompt":"A circle with radius frac{sqrt{2}}{2} and a regular hexagon with side length 1 share the same center.

Thus, ( -3b^2 - 4 + 4nk = x^2 ) for some integer ( x ). - This implies ( x^2 equiv -3b^2 - 4 pmod{n} ). 6. **Consider ( n ) coprime to 3**: - If ( n ) is coprime to 3, there are at most ( frac{n+1}{2} ) different quadratic residues modulo ( n ). Therefore, we can find two such ( x ) and ( y ) satisfying the above property, which leads to a contradiction. 7. **Consider ( n = 3^e )**: - We will show that ( n = 3^e ) works using induction. - Base case: ( n = 3 ) works because ( a^3 + a ) modulo 3 covers all residues ( {0, 1, 2} ). - Inductive step: Assume ( n = 3^k ) works. We need to show ( n = 3^{k+1} ) works. - Let ( a in {0, 1, 2} ). It is enough to show that ( x^3 + x + 3^k a pmod{3^{k+1}} ) is a complete residue system, which is true by induction.

From lg a_{n+1} = |lg a_n - lg a_{n-1}| (n=2,3,4,…), we can derive a_{n+1} = begin{cases} frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}, & text{if } a_n geq a_{n-1} frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}, & text{if } a_n < a_{n-1} end{cases} (n=1,2,3,…)*, and a_n > 0 (n=1,2,3,…). Thus, when n geq 2, we have a_n geq 1 and a_n geq 2 (n=3,4,5,…). If a_4 = a_3 geq 2, then a_5 = 1, which contradicts a_5 geq 2; If a_4 neq a_3 geq 2, let b_m = max{a_{2m+1}, a_{2m+2}} (m=1, 2, 3, …), then b_m geq 2. From (*) we can deduce that a_{2m+3} leq frac{max{a_{2m+1}, a_{2m+2}}}{2} = frac{1}{2}b_m, a_{2m+4} leq frac{1}{2}max{a_{2m+2}, a_{2m+3}}, Thus, max{a_{2m+3}, a_{2m+4}} leq frac{1}{2}b_m, i.e., b_{m+1} leq frac{1}{2}b_m (m=1,2,3,…), So b_m leq frac{b_1}{2^{m+1}}, For b_1, there obviously exists l such that 2^{l-1} leq b_l < 2^{l}. Thus, b_{l+1} leq frac{b_1}{2^{l}} < 1, which contradicts b_m geq 2. Therefore, the assumption is incorrect, and the original statement is correct."},{"prompt":"On an island, there are only knights, who always tell the truth, and liars, who always lie. One fine day, 30 islanders sat around a round table. Each of them can see everyone except himself and his neighbors. Each person in turn said the phrase: Everyone I see is a liar. How many liars were sitting at the table?","completion":"1. Let's denote the total number of islanders as ( N = 30 ). 2. Each islander claims that \\"All whom I see are liars.\\" Let's analyze the situation for an islander named ( I ). ( I ) sees all other islanders except their immediate left and right neighbors. Therefore, ( I ) sees ( N - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 ) islanders. 3. We have two types of statements: - If ( I ) is a knight, their statement \\"All whom I see are liars\\" must be true, implying all 27 seen islanders are liars. - If ( I ) is a liar, their statement \\"All whom I see are liars\\" must be false, meaning there is at least one knight among the 27 seen islanders. 4. Since not all islanders can be liars (if they were, then all of them would be telling the truth, which causes a contradiction), there must be at least one knight. Let's denote the number of knights as ( K ). Thus, the number of liars is ( L = N - K = 30 - K ). Let's analyze the number of knights and liars more closely: Consider the arrangement around the table. Suppose there are ( K ) knights and ( L = 30 - K ) liars. Note that: - Each knight sees 27 islanders who must all be liars. - Each liar cannot see all liars among the 27 islanders they observe; they must see at least one knight to keep their statement false. 5. The neighbor analysis reveals: - Knights need to be spaced out such that the liars' statements remain false. If knights are too close to each other, they would see each other and contradict their own statements of seeing only liars. Following through the logical deductions: - If there were two knights next to each other, they would see each other, which leads to a contradiction since a knight cannot claim another knight to be a liar. Thus, there's a strict alternation between knights and liars with the maximum separation: - We conclude that each knight must be surrounded by liars, both on the left and right side. 6. The optimal configuration to meet all criteria is to have 2 knights properly spaced around the circle with the rest as liars: - Positioning two knights such that they are not immediate neighbors maintains the consistency of each knight's statement. - Each knight will see only liars among the 27 islanders they observe. 7. Therefore, given ( K = 2 ) knights, the number of liars ( L = 30 - 2 = 28 ). In conclusion, the number of liars sitting around the table is (boxed{28})."},{"prompt":"Find the angle of inclination of a line lying in the second bisector plane with the first bisector plane.","completion":"1. **Understand the Problem Statement:** - We need to find the angle of inclination of a line lying in the second bisector plane with respect to the first bisector plane. 2. **Projection to the Common Axis:** - A line lying in the second bisector plane projects onto the first bisector plane such that its projection falls onto the so-called \\"projection axis\\" (commonly referred to as the diagonal axis in high-dimensional geometry). 3. **Determine Inclination:** - To find the angle of inclination, we will determine the angle between the given line and its projection on the projection axis.

This implies the ( c_j ) values are distinct. 2. **Properties of the Sequence ( c_j ):** We need to show that the sequence ( c_1, c_2, ldots ) takes all positive integers eventually, except for a finite number of them. Assume the sequence does not take at least 2016 positive integers. Let ( t ) be a positive integer larger than 2016. Every element ( c_j ) lies in the interval ( [1, t + 2015] ). Since ( c_j ) are distinct and there are ( t ) elements up to ( t ), there are ( t + 2015 - t = 2015 ) numbers that are not taken. This contradicts the assumption that at least 2016 positive integers are not taken. 3. **Choosing ( b ) and ( N ):** Define ( b ) as the number of positive integers not taken by the sequence ( c_1, c_2, ldots ). Let ( N ) be a sufficiently large number such that ( N ) is greater than ( b ). 4. **Estimating Sums:** Our goal is to estimate the sum ( sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (a_j - b) ). Notice that we can rewrite: [ sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (a_j - b) = sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (c_j - j - b) ] By considering ( c_j ) from ( [m+2, n+2015] ), we have exactly ( n - m ) elements missing from the interval of length ( n - m + 2014 ). 5. **Breakdown the Intervals:** Consider the ( 2014 ) missing elements: - ( b - 1 ) are in ( [m+2, m+2015] ). - ( 2015 - b ) are in ( [n+2, n+2015] ). Therefore: [ sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (c_j - j - b) = sum_{i=m+2}^{n+2015} i - H - sum_{j=m+1}^{n} j - sum_{j=m+1}^{n} b ] where ( H ) is the sum of the 2014 missing elements. 6. **Minimum and Maximum Sum of Missing Elements (( H )):** - Minimum sum ( H_{min} ): [ begin{aligned} H_{min} &= sum_{i=m+2}^{m+1+b} i + sum_{i=n+2}^{n+2016-b} i &= frac{(b-1)(2m+b+3)}{2} + frac{(2015-b)(2n+2019-b)}{2} end{aligned} ] - Maximum sum ( H_{max} ): [ begin{aligned} H_{max} &= sum_{i=m+2016-b}^{m+2015} i + sum_{i=n+b+1}^{n+2015} i &= frac{(b-1)(2m+4031-b)}{2} + frac{(2015-b)(2n+2016+b)}{2} end{aligned} ] 7. **Summarizing the Sum Boundaries:** Let ( H ) be the actual sum within the bounds: [ H_{min} leq H leq H_{max} ] Simplifying the sums, we derive the bounds: [ b^2 - 2016b + 2015 leq sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (a_j - b) leq -b^2 + 2016b - 2015 ] 8. **Derived Bound:** Finally, using the simplified expressions: [ left|sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (a_j - b)right| leq 1007^2 - (b-1008)^2 leq 1007^2 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{left|sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (a_j - b)right| leq 1007^2} ]"},{"prompt":"Erica sees 150 butterflies in the garden.

Therefore, the quadratic equation is given by: [ k(x^2 - (m+n)x + mn). ] 2. **Sum of the coefficients:** The sum of the coefficients of the quadratic (kx^2 - k(m+n)x + kmn) is: [ k + k(- (m+n)) + kmn = k(1 - (m+n) + mn). ] We are given that this sum is a prime number.

So, the total money Adam earned from selling 44 books would be: 44 books * 3/book = 132 Adam then used 75% of this money to buy new books. So, the amount he used to buy new books is: 75% of 132 = 0.75 * 132 = 99 Now, if Adam bought one new book for every 3, the number of new books he could buy with 99 would be: 99 / 3/book = 33 books Finally, let's calculate the total number of books Adam would have after these transactions. He originally had 67 books, sold 44, and then bought 33 new ones. 67 books - 44 books + 33 books = 56 books So, Adam would have boxed{56} books after selling some and buying new ones."},{"prompt":"William left Missouri by 7:00 AM and arrived at his hometown by 8:00 PM. He had 3 stops of 25, 10 and 25 minutes respectively during the journey. How many hours did he spend on the road?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time William spent on the journey and then subtract the time he spent on stops to find out how much time he actually spent on the road. First, we convert the end time of the journey from PM to a 24-hour format: - 8:00 PM is equivalent to 20:00 hours. Next, we calculate the total duration of the journey from the start time to the end time: - The journey started at 7:00 AM and ended at 20:00 hours, so the total time spent on the journey is 20 - 7 = 13 hours. Now, we need to calculate the total time spent on stops. William had 3 stops of 25, 10, and 25 minutes respectively: - The total stop time is 25 + 10 + 25 = 60 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the stop time into hours to make it easier to subtract from the total journey time: - The stop time in hours is frac{60}{60} = 1 hour. Finally, we subtract the stop time from the total journey time to find out how much time William actually spent on the road: - Time spent on the road is 13 - 1 = 12 hours.

Here is the step-by-step proof: 1. **Consider the Polynomial and its Properties:** Let ( f(n) = n^{2013} - n^{20} + n^{13} - 2013 ). Observe that ( f(n) ) is a nonconstant polynomial with integer coefficients. We will demonstrate that for any polynomial ( f(n) ) with similar properties, there exists an ( n ) such that ( f(n) ) has at least ( N ) distinct prime factors. 2. **Finding a Positive, Increasing Interval:** Since ( f(n) ) is a nonconstant polynomial, the leading coefficient (which is the coefficient of the highest power term, ( n^{2013} )) is positive. This implies that there exists a positive ( n_0 ) such that ( f(n) ) is positive and increasing for ( n > n_0 ). 3. **Induction Step:** We show that for any given ( k ), if there exists an ( n_1 > n_0 ) such that ( f(n_1) ) has exactly ( k ) distinct prime factors, we can find an ( n_2 > n_1 ) such that ( f(n_2) ) has more than ( k ) distinct prime factors. 4. **Expressing ( f(n) ) in Terms of Prime Factors:** Suppose ( f(n_1) = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} cdots p_k^{r_k} ) where ( p_i ) are distinct primes. We aim to find an ( n_2 ) to introduce a new prime factor. 5. **Choice of ( n_2 ):** Let ( n_2 = n_1 + p_1^{tau_1+1} p_2^{tau_2+1} cdots p_k^{tau_k+1} ), where ( tau_i geq r_i ). This choice ensures that ( n_2 ) is much larger than ( n_1 ). 6. **Modular Arithmetic Analysis:** Consider ( f(n_2) ): [ f(n_2) equiv f(n_1) pmod{p_1^{r_1+1} p_2^{r_2+1} cdots p_k^{r_k+1}} ] This congruence holds because ( n_2 equiv n_1 pmod{p_i^{tau_i+1}} ) for each ( i ). 7. **Divisibility by Prime Powers:** For each ( 1 leq j leq k ), ( p_j^{r_j} ) divides ( f(n_2) ) but ( p_j^{r_j+1} ) does not divide ( f(n_2) ). Therefore, each ( p_j ) still appears to the same power with no increase in divisibility by ( p_j ). 8. **Increment in Prime Factors:** Since ( f(n_2) > f(n_1) ) and the power considerations still hold, we conclude that ( f(n_2) ) must contain at least one additional prime factor compared to ( f(n_1) ). 9. **Conclusion:** By iterating this process, starting from ( n_0 ) and then repeatedly finding ( n_i ) for the next steps, we can construct an ( n ) such that ( f(n) ) has ( N ) or more distinct prime factors.

First, observe that since ( p ) and ( q ) are positive and ( p + q = 1 ), both ( p ) and ( q ) lie in the interval ( (0, 1) ). 3. Consider the function ( f(x) = 1 - x ). Since ( p ) and ( q ) are in ( (0, 1) ), it follows that ( 0 < p^m < 1 ) and ( 0 < q^n < 1 ) for any positive integers ( m ) and ( n ). Therefore, ( 1 - p^m ) and ( 1 - q^n ) are also in ( (0, 1) ). 4. Next, we use the fact that for any ( x in (0, 1) ) and any positive integer ( k ), ( x^k leq x ). This is because ( x ) raised to a higher power will be smaller than or equal to ( x ) itself. 5. Applying this to our terms, we have: [ (1 - p^m)^n geq 1 - np^m ] and [ (1 - q^n)^m geq 1 - mq^n ] by Bernoulli's inequality, which states that for ( x > -1 ) and ( r geq 1 ), ((1 + x)^r geq 1 + rx). 6.

Since ( p + q = 1 ), we can substitute ( q = 1 - p ) into the inequality: [ (1 - p^m)^n + (1 - (1 - p)^n)^m ] 9. We need to show that this expression is greater than or equal to 1. Notice that if ( p = 1 ) or ( q = 1 ), the inequality holds trivially because one of the terms will be zero and the other will be 1. 10. For ( p ) and ( q ) in ( (0, 1) ), we use the convexity of the function ( f(x) = (1 - x)^k ) for ( k geq 1 ). Since ( f(x) ) is convex, the sum of the convex functions will be greater than or equal to the sum of their linear approximations at the endpoints. 11.

So, the function can be written as f(x) = 2sin(2x + φ) + 1, where - frac {π}{2} < φ < frac {π}{2}. To find φ, we use the fact that f(x) has a maximum value of 3 at x = frac{π}{3}. This gives us the equation 2sin(2 cdot frac{π}{3} + φ) + 1 = 3, which simplifies to sin(frac{4π}{3} + φ) = 1. Solving for φ, we get φ = -frac{π}{6}. Therefore, the analytical expression of the function f(x) is boxed{f(x) = 2sin(2x - frac{π}{6}) + 1}. 2. Now, we need to find the range of f(x) when x ∈ [0, frac {π}{2}]. First, let's find the range of 2x - frac{π}{6} when x ∈ [0, frac {π}{2}]. Since 0 ≤ x ≤ frac{π}{2}, we have - frac{π}{6} ≤ 2x - frac{π}{6} ≤ frac{5π}{6}. Next, since the range of sin(θ) is [-1, 1] for any real number θ, the range of sin(2x - frac{π}{6}) is [-1, 1] when - frac{π}{6} ≤ 2x - frac{π}{6} ≤ frac{5π}{6}. However, we also know that sin(θ) is increasing on the interval [- frac{π}{2}, frac{π}{2}] and decreasing on the interval [frac{π}{2}, frac{3π}{2}]. Therefore, the maximum value of sin(2x - frac{π}{6}) on the interval [- frac{π}{6}, frac{5π}{6}] is 1, and the minimum value is -sin(frac{π}{6}) = -frac{1}{2}. Hence, the range of 2sin(2x - frac{π}{6}) is [-frac{1}{2} cdot 2, 1 cdot 2] = [-1, 2]. Finally, adding 1 to every value in the range of 2sin(2x - frac{π}{6}), we get the range of f(x) to be boxed{[0, 3]}."},{"prompt":"Calculate: 2a^2+4a^2=.","completion":"We have -2a^2+4a^2=(−2+4)a^2=2a^2.

Thus, the nth number can be represented as left(-2right)^{n-1}. So, the 7th number is left(-2right)^{7-1} = 64. - For row ③, the pattern is that each number is double the previous one, starting from 3. Thus, the nth number can be represented as 3times 2^{n-1}. So, the 7th number is 3times 2^{7-1} = 192. Therefore, the answers are: boxed{64}, boxed{64}, boxed{192}.

Given that Principal A and Principal B cannot be on adjacent days and Director C and Director D also cannot be on adjacent days, we need to subtract the arrangements that don't meet the criteria from all possible arrangements. First, let's consider the total number of possible arrangements without any restrictions. There are 6 people, so the number of permutations is 6!, which equals 720. Next, we will consider the number of invalid arrangements where Principal A and Principal B are on duty on adjacent days. We can treat the pair of principals as a single entity, thus we have 5 entities to arrange now: the principal-pair and the other 4 individuals. The possible arrangements for these entities are 5!, and for each arrangement, the two principals can switch places with each other, giving us 2! arrangements for the principals. In total, the number of invalid arrangements with adjacent principals is 2! times 5! = 240. Similarly, the same logic applies for Director C and Director D being on duty on adjacent days, which also gives us 240 invalid arrangements. However, we need to also consider the cases where both pairs are adjacent at the same time. We treat each pair as a single entity, so we have 4 entities to arrange: the principal-pair, director-pair, and the other 2 individuals. This case gives us 4! arrangements for the entities. Within this, each pair has 2! arrangements for themselves. So the number of cases where both pairs are adjacent is 2! times 2! times 4! = 96. We added back these cases because they were subtracted twice in the previous steps.

This movement always transitions the knight from a square of one color to a square of the opposite color. 2. **Coloring property**: On a standard chessboard, squares are alternately colored in a checkerboard pattern. Thus, any knight's move changes the color of the square it occupies from, say, white to black, or from black to white. 3. **Starting and ending square colors**: The knight starts at the bottom-left corner which is (1,1). On a standard 8x8 chessboard, the (1,1) square is typically black. The knight needs to move to the top-right corner, which is (8,8), and this square is both diagonally opposite to the starting square and has the same color, black. 4. **Counting steps based on colors**: If the knight makes 63 moves to visit every square exactly once: - A single move transitions from one color to the other, so: [ text{Number of moves} = 2n + 1 quad text{since} quad text{black} rightarrow text{white} rightarrow text{black}... ] - Here, for 63 moves: [ 63 equiv 1 pmod{2} implies text{Odd number of moves} ] - After taking an odd number of moves, the knight would end on a square of the opposite color from the starting square. 5. **Conclusion from color property**: Since the knight starts on a black square and must alternate colors with each move, after 63 moves (an odd number), it must land on a white square. Consequently, the knight cannot land on (8,8) because it is black, contradicting the requirement of passing through each square exactly once and finishing on (8,8).

Substituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get: [ Delta = (-k)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (k-1)^2 ] Simplifying this, we have: [ Delta = k^2 - 4(k-1)^2 ] 2. **Simplify the discriminant expression:** Expand and simplify the expression for the discriminant: [ Delta = k^2 - 4(k^2 - 2k + 1) ] [ Delta = k^2 - 4k^2 + 8k - 4 ] [ Delta = -3k^2 + 8k - 4 ] 3. **Determine the condition for real roots:** For the quadratic function ( f(x) ) to have at least one real root, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ Delta geq 0 ] Therefore, we need to solve: [ -3k^2 + 8k - 4 geq 0 ] 4. **Solve the inequality:** First, solve the equality ( -3k^2 + 8k - 4 = 0 ) to find the critical points. This is a quadratic equation in ( k ): [ -3k^2 + 8k - 4 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula ( k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = -3 ), ( b = 8 ), and ( c = -4 ): [ k = frac{-8 pm sqrt{8^2 - 4(-3)(-4)}}{2(-3)} ] [ k = frac{-8 pm sqrt{64 - 48}}{-6} ] [ k = frac{-8 pm sqrt{16}}{-6} ] [ k = frac{-8 pm 4}{-6} ] This gives us two solutions: [ k = frac{-8 + 4}{-6} = frac{-4}{-6} = frac{2}{3} ] [ k = frac{-8 - 4}{-6} = frac{-12}{-6} = 2 ] 5. **Analyze the inequality:** The quadratic ( -3k^2 + 8k - 4 ) opens downwards (since the coefficient of ( k^2 ) is negative). Therefore, the inequality ( -3k^2 + 8k - 4 geq 0 ) holds between the roots ( frac{2}{3} ) and ( 2 ): [ frac{2}{3} leq k leq 2 ] 6. **Determine the largest possible value of ( k ):** The largest possible real value of ( k ) within this interval is ( k = 2 ).

To determine the nature of ( x = 2a - 1 ), we analyze the behavior of ( f'(x) ): - For ( x in (-1, 2a - 1) ), ( 2a - 1 - x > 0 implies f'(x) > 0 ). Thus, ( f(x) ) is increasing. - For ( x in (2a - 1, +infty) ), ( 2a - 1 - x < 0 implies f'(x) < 0 ). Thus, ( f(x) ) is decreasing. 6. Therefore, ( f(x) ) increases on ( (-1, 2a - 1) ) and decreases on ( (2a - 1, +infty) ). 7. Evaluating ( f(x) ) at the critical point: [ f(2a - 1) = 2a ln(1 + (2a - 1)) - (2a - 1) = 2a ln(2a) - 2a + 1 ] 8. Hence, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is ( 2a ln(2a) - 2a + 1 ) and there is no minimum value of ( f(x) ): [ f(x)_{text{max}} = 2a ln(2a) - 2a + 1, quad text{and no minimum value}. ] Part (2): 1. We need to prove the inequality ( 4 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{n} > ln(n + 1) + left( 1 + frac{1}{n} right)^n ) for ( n in mathbb{N}^* ). 2. Consider ( a = frac{1}{2} ) in ( f(x) ). Then: [ f(x) = ln(1 + x) - frac{x}{2} ] 3. Note that ( f(x) leq 0 ), which implies: [ ln(1 + x) leq frac{x}{2} quad text{for all } x ge 0 ] 4. The equality holds if and only if ( x = 0 ). 5. Considering the series ( 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{n} ): [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{n} > ln(2) + lnleft(frac{3}{2}right) + lnleft(frac{4}{3}right) + cdots + lnleft(frac{n + 1}{n}right) ] 6. Summing the logarithms: [ lnleft(2 cdot frac{3}{2} cdot frac{4}{3} cdots frac{n + 1}{n}right) = ln(n + 1) ] 7. Hence: [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{n} > ln(n + 1) ] 8. On another hand, using the approximation for ( ln left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) ): [ left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^n = e^{n lnleft(1 + frac{1}{n}right)} < e^1 = e < 3 ] 9. Combining both sides: [ 4 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{n} > ln (n + 1) + left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^n ] 10. Thus, we have proved the required inequality.

Given the equation ( P^4 + Q^4 = R^2 ), we need to prove that there exist real numbers ( p, q, r ) and a polynomial ( S ) such that ( P = pS ), ( Q = qS ), and ( R = rS^2 ). 2. Suppose ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) have no common roots. If they did, we could factor them out from the two, and hence from the third. Also, suppose ( deg(P) geq deg(Q) ), and the leading coefficients of ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) are all positive. Suppose we choose ( P ) so that the degree is the smallest and greater than 0. 3. Rewrite the equation as: [ P^4 = (R - Q^2)(R + Q^2) ] Then all the roots of ( P ) are roots of one of these two polynomials. They can't be roots of both factors, because that would mean ( P ) had a root in common with ( R ) and ( Q ). So since each root of the left side is a root 4 times and no number is a root of both factors on the right side, then both factors must be of the form ( cS^4 ), and since the leading coefficients of both ( R ) and ( Q ) are positive, both ( c )'s have to be positive. We can hence fold that inside ( S ). 4. Let: [ R - Q^2 = left(frac{S}{sqrt[4]{2}}right)^4 quad text{and} quad R + Q^2 = left(frac{T}{sqrt[4]{2}}right)^4 ] Without loss of generality, assume ( S ) and ( T ) both have positive leading coefficients. 5.

We have a new solution with a smaller degree than the smallest degree greater than 0, which is impossible. Hence the degree of ( P ) must be 0, and ( P ) is a constant. Hence so are ( Q ) and ( R ). 7. Since we assumed at the beginning that ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) have no roots in common, when we remove that assumption we can gather all the common roots of ( P ) and ( Q ) into a polynomial, say ( S ).

The foci of the hyperbola can be found with the formula (h, k pm ae) for a hyperbola centered at (h, k) with vertical transverse axis.

The condition is that if we remove any vertex from ( G ), the remaining graph has a complete subgraph (clique) with ( n ) vertices.

To find the rate per hour, we convert 11/2 minutes to hours: 11/2 minutes = 11/2 * 1/60 hours = 11/120 hours Now, we find the rate of water entering per hour: (9/4) tonnes / (11/120) hours = (9/4) * (120/11) tonnes/hour = (9 * 120) / (4 * 11) tonnes/hour = 1080 / 44 tonnes/hour = 24.5454545... tonnes/hour This is approximately 24.55 tonnes per hour entering the ship. Next, we know the pumps can throw out 12 tonnes of water per hour. To find the net rate of water entering the ship, we subtract the pump's rate from the leak's rate: 24.55 tonnes/hour - 12 tonnes/hour = 12.55 tonnes/hour This is the net rate at which water is entering the ship. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the ship to reach the shore. The ship is 77 km from the shore and travels at an average rate of 10.5 km/h. The time to reach the shore is: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 77 km / 10.5 km/h Time = 7.333333... hours This is approximately 7.33 hours to reach the shore.

If the shopkeeper has made a certain profit percentage, and the cost price of the article is Rs. 526.50, what is the profit percentage?","completion":"Let's first calculate the sales tax amount included in the sale price. The sale price of the article including the sales tax is Rs. 616. The rate of sales tax is 10%. To find the actual sale price of the article without the sales tax, we can use the following formula: Actual Sale Price = Sale Price with Tax / (1 + Sales Tax Rate) In this case, the Actual Sale Price (ASP) would be: ASP = 616 / (1 + 0.10) ASP = 616 / 1.10 ASP = 560 Now we have the actual sale price without the sales tax, which is Rs. 560. Next, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. The profit is the difference between the actual sale price and the cost price. Profit = Actual Sale Price - Cost Price Profit = 560 - 526.50 Profit = 33.50 Now we have the profit amount, which is Rs. 33.50. To find the profit percentage, we use the following formula: Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 Profit Percentage = (33.50 / 526.50) * 100 Profit Percentage ≈ (0.0636) * 100 Profit Percentage ≈ 6.36% Therefore, the profit percentage made by the shopkeeper is approximately boxed{6.36%} ."},{"prompt":"Given that a is an angle in the second quadrant, sin alpha= frac {4}{5}, then tan alpha= ( ) A: frac {3}{4} B: frac {4}{3} C: frac {4}{3} D: frac {3}{4}","completion":"Solution: a is an angle in the second quadrant, sin alpha= frac {4}{5}, thereforecos alpha=- sqrt {1-sin ^{2}alpha}=- frac {3}{5}. thereforetan alpha= frac {sin alpha}{cos alpha}= frac { frac {4}{5}}{- frac {3}{5}}=- frac {4}{3}.

Let's examine ( n = 1 ): [ f_1(3) = frac{1}{3} quad text{and} quad f_1(4) = frac{1}{4} ] Now, note that since the function is linear and we need to find ( f_1(5) ), we consider the linearity property: [ f_1(5) = c_1 cdot f_1(3) + c_2 cdot f_1(4) ] where ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ) are constants. We have: [ 5 = c_1 cdot 3 + c_2 cdot 4 ] Solving the above equation: [ c_1 cdot 3 + c_2 cdot 4 = 5 quad text{and} quad c_1 + c_2 = 1 ] We can solve these simultaneously to find: [ c_1 = frac{1}{2}, quad c_2 = frac{1}{2} ] Hence, substituting back: [ f_1(5) = frac{1}{2} cdot f_1(3) + frac{1}{2} cdot f_1(4) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{6} ] Therefore, the base case holds with: [ f_1(5) = frac{1}{6} ] - **Inductive Step:** Suppose ( f_{n-1}(5, 5, ldots, 5) = frac{1}{6^{n-1}} ) for some ( n > 1 ). We need to show that ( f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5) = frac{1}{6^{n}} ). Define: [ g(x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}) = 3 f_{n}(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n-1}, 3) ] Since ( g ) is also linear in ( x_1, ldots, x_{n-1} ) and: [ g(3, ldots, 3) = 1 quad text{and} quad g(4, ldots, 4) = frac{1}{2} ] Using the inductive hypothesis: [ g(5, ldots, 5) = 3 cdot f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 3) ] We know: [ g(5, 5, ldots, 5) = frac{1}{6^{n-1}} ] Thus: [ g(5, ldots, 5, 3) = frac{1}{3} cdot g(5, 5, ldots, 5) = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{6^{n-1}} = frac{1}{3 cdot 6^{n-1}} ] Similarly: [ f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 4) = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{1}{6^{n-1}} = frac{1}{4 cdot 6^{n-1}} ] Now, by linearity: [ f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 5) = 2 cdot f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 4) - f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 3) ] Substituting the values: [ f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 4) = frac{1}{4 cdot 6^{n-1}}, quad f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5, 3) = frac{1}{3 cdot 6^{n-1}} ] Therefore: [ f_{n}(5, 5, ldots, 5) = 2 cdot frac{1}{4 cdot 6^{n-1}} - frac{1}{3 cdot 6^{n-1}} = left( frac{1}{2 cdot 6^{n-1}} - frac{1}{3 cdot 6^{n-1}} right) = frac{1}{2 cdot 6^{n-1}} - frac{1}{3 cdot 6^{n-1}} = frac{3 - 2}{6 cdot 6^{n-1}} = frac{1}{6^{n}} ] Hence, by induction, we conclude that: [ f_n(5, 5, ldots, 5) = frac{1}{6^{n}} ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{frac{1}{6^{n}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the lines 2x+y8=0 and x2y+1=0 intersect at point P.

Step 1: Recognize the standard form of a hyperbola equation. The standard form of a hyperbola equation is frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 or frac{y^2}{b^2}-frac{x^2}{a^2}=1, where a^2 and b^2 are positive constants. This means both denominators in our given equation must be positive for it to represent a hyperbola. Step 2: Apply the condition for the equation to represent a hyperbola. For frac{x^2}{m}-frac{y^2}{m+1}=1 to represent a hyperbola, both m and m+1 must be either positive or negative, but they cannot be zero or change signs because one term is subtracted from the other. This leads to the condition m(m+1) > 0. Step 3: Solve the inequality m(m+1) > 0. To solve this inequality, we look for values of m that make the product positive. This occurs when both m and m+1 are positive, or both are negative: - When m > 0, m+1 is also positive, satisfying the condition. - When m < -1, m+1 is negative (but less negative than m), so their product is also positive. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is m > 0 or m < -1. Step 4: Express the solution as a range. The range of m for which the given equation represents a hyperbola is the union of the intervals where m is greater than 0 and less than -1.

Square both sides of the given equation, we get _(ρ^2 = 4cos^2 θ)_. 4. Substitute _(ρcos θ = x)_ into the squared equation, we have _(ρ^2 = 4xcos θ)_. 5. Since _(ρ^2 = x^2 + y^2)_, we can substitute this into the previous equation to get _(x^2 + y^2 = 4xcos θ)_. 6. Substitute _(x = ρcos θ)_ back into the equation, we have _(x^2 + y^2 = 4xcos θ = 2ρcos θ = 2x)_. 7.

The next multiple after 12 that accommodates (z = 0) is (n = 12) itself, because (z = 0) satisfies (0^n = 0) for any non-negative integer (n), but here, since it does not affect the computation of (n) for other non-zero (12^text{th}) roots, we still conclude the smallest integer (n) must be (12).

Calculating the exact value of such large factorials and then performing the operations would require specialized software or programming to handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic. But we can make some observations: 1. The factorial of any number greater than 9 will end with at least one zero because it includes the product of 10 (which is 2 × 5). 2. The larger the factorial, the more trailing zeros it will have because it includes more multiples of 10. 3. Since we are dividing by 7, which is a prime number, it will not affect the trailing zeros. Given these observations, we can infer that the 1000th digit from the right of this expression will be a zero. This is because the factorials involved are large enough to ensure that there are many trailing zeros, and dividing by 7 will not change the fact that there are at least 1000 trailing zeros.

Therefore, in base-7, a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is divisible by 2: If the last digit is 0, 2, or 4 in base-7, the number is divisible by 2. 2. **Divisibility by 3 in base-7:** - Let's explore similar concepts for divisibility by 3. - The base 7 can also be written in terms of 3 with a remainder: [ 7 = 3 cdot 2 + 1 ] - Similarly, higher powers of 7 behave as follows modulo 3: [ 7^2 = 3 cdot (2 cdot 4) + 1 = 3 cdot 8 + 1 = 3 cdot 16 + 1 ] Once again, from these equations, every power of 7 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Hence, a number is divisible by 3 if the last digit is divisible by 3: If the last digit is 0 or 3 in base-7, the number is divisible by 3. **Conclusion:** For the base-7 numeral system, the following divisibility rules hold: - A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is one of (0, 2, 4). - A number is divisible by 3 if its last digit is one of (0, 3). boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Let z and w be complex numbers such that |z 2 + 5i| = 2 and |w + 3 4i| = 4.

Thus, stating that m is parallel to n just based on their parallelism to alpha does not cover all possibilities.

Claiming that m is perpendicular to n under these conditions is not supported by the information given.

Since they lost by one run, their score in those games must be one less than their opponents' score. Additionally, in the games they won, they scored twice as many runs as their opponents. 2. **Determine the scores for the lost games:** The team's scores were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Since they lost by one run in five games, and they must have scored less than their opponents in those games, it is logical to assume that these were the games where they scored odd numbers (since an even score would imply they could double an opponent's score, which is a win condition). Thus, the games they lost are the ones where they scored 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 runs. 3. **Calculate the opponents' scores in the lost games:** Since they lost each of these games by one run, the opponents' scores in these games were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 respectively. 4. **Determine the scores for the won games:** The remaining scores where the team won are the even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. According to the problem, in these games, they scored twice as many runs as their opponents. 5. **Calculate the opponents' scores in the won games:** Since the team scored twice as many runs as their opponents in these games, the opponents' scores were half of the team's scores.

Using the formula for the inradius r of triangle ABC, we know: [ frac{r}{s - c} = tan left(frac{C}{2}right) ] where s is the semiperimeter of triangle ABC and C is the measure of angle ACB. 3. Similarly, for the exradius q opposite angle ACB, we have: [ frac{q}{s} = tan left(frac{C}{2}right) ] 4. Combining these two equations, we get: [ frac{r}{q} = frac{s - c}{s} ] 5.

Maddie spent a total of 66, and we know that part of this cost is from the 4 packs of blue T-shirts. So, the cost of the blue T-shirts is ( 4 times 9 = 36 ). Now, we can subtract the cost of the blue T-shirts from the total cost to find out how much was spent on white T-shirts: ( 66 - 36 = 30 ) Since each pack of white T-shirts costs 15, we can find the number of packs of white T-shirts by dividing the total cost for white T-shirts by the cost per pack: ( W = frac{30}{15} = 2 ) Maddie bought boxed{2} packs of white T-shirts."},{"prompt":"Ryan has 30 stickers.

We aim to understand how to transform the graph of y=cos 2x to match the given function through horizontal shifting. The argument inside the cosine function for the given function is (2x+dfrac{pi }{3}). This can be thought of as a transformation of the argument 2x in the base function, where the entire graph of y=cos 2x is shifted horizontally to achieve the new argument structure. To see how the graph is shifted, we compare the argument of the cosine function in both cases. The argument in the given function can be rewritten as 2(x + dfrac{pi }{6}), which indicates a shift. Specifically, it shows that the input x in the base function y=cos 2x needs to be replaced with (x + dfrac{pi }{6}) to match the given function. This translates to a horizontal shift of the graph of y=cos 2x.

We follow these steps: 1. **Define the product space and its sigma algebra.** Let [ Omega = prod_{t in T} Omega_{t}, quad mathscr{F} = bigotimes_{t in T} mathscr{F}_{t} ] which is the product space and the product sigma-algebra, respectively. 2. **Consider the sigma algebras on finite products:** Define mathscr{F}_{t_{infty}} for t_{infty} = (t_n)_{n geq 1} in T^{infty} to be the sigma algebra generated by finite-dimensional cylinder sets: [ mathscr{F}_{infty} = bigotimes_{n geq 1} mathscr{F}_{t_{n}}, ] which consists of all sets B subseteq Omega such that [ B = left{ (omega_{t})_{t in T} : (omega_{t_n})_{n geq 1} in C right} ] for some C in bigotimes_{n geq 1} mathscr{F}_{t_{n}}. 3. **Uniqueness of product measures:** Since each Omega_{t_{n}}, mathscr{F}_{t_{n}}, mathrm{P}_{t_{n}} forms a probability space, by the uniqueness of product measures for finite countable collections, we have a unique probability measure mathrm{P}_{t_{infty}} on [ Omega = prod_{n geq 1} Omega_{t_{n}}, quad mathscr{F} = bigotimes_{n geq 1} mathscr{F}_{t_{n}} ] such that [ mathrm{P}_{t_{infty}} left( prod_{n geq 1} B_{t_{n}} right) = prod_{n geq 1} mathrm{P}_{t_{n}} left( B_{t_{n}} right), ] where B_{t_{n}} in mathscr{F}_{t_{n}}, n geq 1. 4. **Define the measure on (Omega, mathscr{F}) by consistency:** Using these product measures mathrm{P}_{t_{infty}}, we conclude there exists a unique measure mathrm{P} on (Omega, mathscr{F}) such that for B = left{ (omega_{t})_{t in T} : (omega_{t_n})_{n geq 1} in C right} with C in bigotimes_{n geq 1} mathscr{F}_{t_{n}} for some t_{infty} = (t_n)_{n geq 1}, [ mathrm{P}(B) = mathrm{P}_{t_{infty}}(C), ] ensuring the consistency and generating the measure on the entire product space.

Define [ (Omega_{t}, mathscr{F}_{t}) = (E_{t}, mathscr{E}_{t}), quad t in T. ] 2. **Construct the product space and measure:** Define the product space and measure as in part (a): [ Omega = prod_{t in T} E_{t}, quad mathscr{F} = bigotimes_{t in T} mathscr{E}_{t}, quad mathrm{P} ] where mathrm{P} is the unique product measure satisfying [ mathrm{P}left(prod_{t in T} B_{t}right) = prod_{t in T} mathrm{P}_{t}(B_{t}) ] for B_{t} in mathscr{E}_{t}. 3. **Define random elements:** Define for each omega = (omega_{t})_{t in T} in Omega, [ X_{t}(omega) = omega_{t}, quad t in T. ] Each X_{t} is mathscr{F} / mathscr{E}_{t}-measurable since omega_{t} is measurable. 4. **Verify the independence and distribution:** Show that the random elements X_{t} are independent and distributed according to mathrm{P}_{t}: [ mathrm{P}left(X_{t} in Bright) = mathrm{P}_{t}(B), quad B in mathscr{E}_{t}. ] These steps conclude the proof. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A league with 16 teams holds a roundrobin tournament, with each team playing every other team exactly once.

The number of games won determines odd/even score due to 3 points for a win (odd increment). A total number of wins among all teams is still even (from pairing of match outcomes). Hence, the number of teams with an odd number of wins — and thus an odd total score — must be even. This statement is true. 2. **Statement (B):** \\"The sum of the scores must be divisible by 3.\\" - A game can result in 3 points for one team (win) or 1 point each for both teams (draw), keeping individual match contributions divisible by 3. As each game's total point contribution is divisible by 3, the sum of all scores (sum of each divisible-by-3 block) is divisible by 3. This statement is true. 3. **Statement (C):** \\"There can be at most one score of 0.\\" - Like in the previous scenario, a team scoring 0 would imply it lost all games. If one team loses all games, no other team can score 0 as each would win at least one game. This statement is true. 4. **Statement (D):** \\"The sum of the scores must be at least 200.\\" - Given there are ({16 choose 2} = 120) games, each game adds either 3 (win/loss) or 2 (draw) points to the total league score. The lowest possible sum (all draws) is (120 times 2 = 240). This statement is true, as 240 is more than 200. 5. **Statement (E):** \\"The highest score must be at least 20.\\" - Consider most games ending in a draw with a few wins for some teams — it's possible for the highest score to remain below 20. For example, only a few wins needed to keep other scores around minimal in case of majority draws. This might not suffice to reach 20. Hence, this statement could be false depending on game outcomes. # Conclusion: The statement that is NOT necessarily true is textbf{(E)}.

Therefore, ( d(k) = 2 ) and all subsequent terms in the series are 2. Hence, the series will not have a perfect square. 5. **Case Analysis for Composite ( k ):** Consider: [ k = 6 implies a_0 = 6, quad a_1 = d(6) = 4. ] Since ( 6 ) has divisors {1, 2, 3, 6}, ( d(6) = 4 ) which is a perfect square.

Now, let's analyze each given option to see if it can be expressed in the form (2 times (text{perfect square})): - **Option A: 50** [ 50 = 2 times 25 ] Since (25 = 5^2) is a perfect square, (50 = 2 times 25) satisfies the condition. - **Option B: 100** [ 100 = 2 times 50 ] (50) is not a perfect square, so (100) cannot be expressed in the required form. - **Option C: 200** [ 200 = 2 times 100 ] Since (100 = 10^2) is a perfect square, (200 = 2 times 100) satisfies the condition. - **Option D: 450** [ 450 = 2 times 225 ] Since (225 = 15^2) is a perfect square, (450 = 2 times 225) satisfies the condition. - **Option E: 800** [ 800 = 2 times 400 ] Since (400 = 20^2) is a perfect square, (800 = 2 times 400) satisfies the condition. 6.

Since A includes numbers less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to 3, and B includes numbers from 1 to 6, the intersection will only include those numbers that are both greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 6.

When this is combined with B, the range extends from numbers just greater than -1 up to the upper limit of B, which is 6.

Let's go through the detailed steps on how this example works. 1. **Establish Initial Conditions:** Let (N = 2) and (M = 1008). We need to investigate whether adding (1008) multiple times to (2) will result in numbers maintaining the same digit sum properties. 2. **Understand the Modulo Operation:** Notice that (M) is a multiple of (16) because (1008 div 16 = 63), which is an integer. Therefore, all the numbers resulting from adding (M) to (N) multiple times will have a decimal representation such that the sum of digits is ( equiv N pmod{16}). 3. **Sum Conservation in Modulo Operation:** Since (N = 2), we must show if ((2 + k cdot 1008) ,text{mod}, 16) ever yields a digit sum adding the same as (N): [ (2 + k cdot 1008) mod 16 implies 2 mod 16 = 2. ] 4. **Possibilities for Sum of Digits:** The numbers that we will generate are congruent to (2 mod 16). These numbers need to be explored for their digit sums. We need the digit sums to add up (2 mod 9) since the digit sum property remains true under modulo (9) for checking these sums against the base (N). 5. **Arithmetic and Powers of 10 Modulo 16:** Consider digits' positions and place values in base 10: [ begin{align*} 10^0 &equiv 1 mod 16, 10^1 &equiv 10 mod 16, 10^2 &equiv 4 mod 16, 10^3 &equiv 8 mod 16, 10^4 &equiv 1 mod 16, quad text{(repeats every 4 digits cycle)}. end{align*} ] For resulting numbers in form (2 + k cdot 1008 ), potential sums are derived from combinations of place values. 6. **Determine if (2) Can Be Derived Differently:** - Single digit derived sum (2) happens for number (2). - (10 + 8 - 16 rightarrow 2) gives us another number (1010), which repeats every cycle due to modulo (16) behavior. Finally, since the viable digit sums retaining modulo condition are limited and do not fit broad ranges, hence recalculating while our scope remains within the digit modulus boundaries only yields repeating sequences of 2 and modular constraints concrete the conclusion not adding further variety besides (N) itself unaltered. **Conclusion:** Petya will not necessarily get other numbers with the same digit sum properties as (N = 2) beyond (N) or its exact computed cyclic repeat within digit sum invariance.

Thus, the number of such pairs is 2|S|. 5. **Second Counting Method:** - Choose e = {a, b} from any pair of vertices with different colors. There are n(2017 - n) such pairs since there are n red vertices and 2017 - n blue vertices. - For each such pair {a, b}, we need to choose c such that {a, b, c} in S. The possible choices for c are 2a - b, frac{a + b}{2}, 2b - a pmod{2017}. - Since a notequiv b pmod{2017} and gcd(2017, 6) = 1, these three numbers are distinct modulo 2017.

For 2 pieces of prize A and 3 pieces of prize B, the cost is 70: 2x + 3y = 70. Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate y: 2(x + 2y) = 2 cdot 40 Rightarrow 2x + 4y = 80. - Subtract the original second equation from this result: (2x + 4y) - (2x + 3y) = 80 - 70 Rightarrow y = 10. - Substitute y = 10 into the first equation to find x: x + 2(10) = 40 Rightarrow x = 20.

So, we have: boxed{x = 20, y = 10} Part 2: Minimizing the Total Cost Let's denote the number of prize A pieces purchased as m, and thus the number of prize B pieces will be (60 - m). The total cost, w, for purchasing these prizes can be expressed as: w = 20m + 10(60 - m) Simplifying this expression gives us: w = 20m + 600 - 10m = 10m + 600 Since the coefficient of m in the cost equation (10) is positive, the total cost w increases as the number of prize A pieces m increases. To minimize the total cost, we should therefore minimize m, given the constraint that at least 20 pieces of prize A are needed (m geqslant 20). Thus, the minimum cost is achieved when m = 20, and substituting this into the cost equation gives: w = 10(20) + 600 = 200 + 600 = 800 Therefore, to minimize the total cost, the school should purchase 20 pieces of prize A and (60 - 20) = 40 pieces of prize B, resulting in a minimum total cost of: boxed{800 text{ dollars}}"},{"prompt":"(**Geometry**) The point P(x, y, z), which is equidistant from points A(1, 2, 3) and B(0, 0, 5), satisfies the condition __________.","completion":"The condition that the coordinates of point P(x, y, z) satisfy is 2x - 4y + 4z = 11.

First, we express the important angle relationships in ( triangle ABC ): [ angle BAO = frac{alpha}{2} ] since point ( O ) lies on the internal angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), [ angle CBO = 90^circ - frac{beta}{2} ] since point ( O ) lies on the external angle bisector of ( angle ABC ) and the angle bisector theorem tells us the following relationship in terms of right angle and half angle: [ angle ABO = beta + angle CBO = beta + (90^circ - frac{beta}{2}) = 90^circ + frac{beta}{2} ] Now consider the triangle ( triangle AOB ): [ angle AOB = 180^circ - frac{alpha}{2} - (90^circ + frac{beta}{2}) = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} - frac{beta}{2} = frac{gamma}{2} ] since ( alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ).

The key to solving the problem is to use the fact that the sum of any two terms in the sequence {a_n} is still a term in the sequence to find out d= frac{243}{k+1-m-n}, which is a medium-level question. First, find the general formula of the sequence, calculate the sum of any two terms in the sequence {a_n}, and based on the fact that the sum of any two terms in the sequence {a_n} is still a term in the sequence, find out d= frac{243}{k+1-m-n}.

For this chord to be parallel to line l: 3x - 4y - 15 = 0, their slopes must be equal. This gives us the equation: frac{2}{3} = frac{-4m}{-4} neq frac{-25}{-15}. Solving it, we find m = frac{2}{3}.

Step 3: Finding the Centroid of ( triangle PQR ) The centroid of a triangle with vertices ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), ((x_3, y_3)) is given by: [ left( frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} right) ] Substituting the coordinates of ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ): [ left( frac{frac{b}{2} + frac{b+c}{2} + frac{c}{2}}{3}, frac{frac{bsqrt{3}}{2} + frac{(c-b)sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{csqrt{3}}{2}}{3} right) ] Simplifying both components separately: [ x = frac{frac{b}{2} + frac{b+c}{2} + frac{c}{2}}{3} = frac{frac{2b + 2c}{2}}{3} = frac{b+c}{3} ] [ y = frac{frac{bsqrt{3}}{2} + frac{(c-b)sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{csqrt{3}}{2}}{3} = frac{frac{b sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{c sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{b sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{c sqrt{3}}{2}}{3} = frac{0}{3} = 0 ] So the centroid is ( left( frac{b+c}{3}, 0 right) ), which lies on ( AC ). Step 4: Verifying Equilateral Property of Triangle ( PQR ) Now, we need to show that ( triangle PQR ) is equilateral by checking the distances ( PQ ), ( PR ), and ( QR ). **Distance ( PR ):** [ PR = sqrt{left(frac{b}{2} - frac{c}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{b sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{c sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2} = sqrt{left(frac{b - c}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{b+c}{2}sqrt{3}right)^2} = sqrt{left(frac{b-c}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{b+c}{2}sqrt{3}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{(b-c)^2}{4} + frac{3(b+c)^2}{4}} = sqrt{frac{(b-c)^2 + 3(b+c)^2}{4}} = frac{sqrt{(b-c)^2 + 3b^2 + 6bc + 3c^2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{4b^2 - 4bc + 3bc + 3c^2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{4(b^2 + c^2 + 3bc)}}{2} = sqrt{ (b^2 - bc + c^2)/3 } = sqrt{ (b^2+b c+c^2)} PR =sqrt{ (b^2 + 3bc +c^2) )/3} **Distance ( PQ ):** [ PQ = sqrt{left( frac{b+c}{2} - frac{b}{2} right)^2 + left(frac{(c-b)sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{b sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2} = sqrt{left( frac{c}{2} right)^2 + left(frac{(c)}{sqrt{3}} right)^2} = frac{c}{2} = b PQ = sqrt{ (b^2 + 3bc +c^2) )/3} = sqrt Therefore, ( PQ ), ( PR ), and ( QR ) are all equal Hence, ( triangle PQR ) is equilateral.

Define S as the set of all diagonals of this polygon. The goal is to partition S into k subsets S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k such that for any i neq j, there are some diagonals in S_i and S_j that intersect. Find the maximum possible value of k. 1. **Upper Bound for k:** To show that k leq (n-1)(4n-1), we proceed with a proof by contradiction. [ k > (n-1)(4n-1) ] The number of diagonals in the polygon is given by: [ |S| = 2(n-1)(4n-1) ] By the pigeonhole principle, if k is greater than (n-1)(4n-1), at least one of the subsets S_i must contain only one diagonal, say l. 2. **Consideration of diagonal l:** Let the two endpoints of the diagonal l divide the circumference of the polygon into two parts with m and 4n-3-m vertices, respectively. Denote the vertices of the polygon as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{4n-1}. To guarantee that there exists one diagonal in another set S_j that intersects l, at least one diagonal from these two parts (m and 4n-3-m) must intersect. 3. **Establishing a Bound:** From the interaction behavior of diagonals, we have: [ (n-1)(4n-1) < k leq m(4n-3-m) + 1 ] As m ranges from 1 to 2n-1, the worst-case scenario gives us: [ k leq (2n-2)(2n-1) + 1 = (n-1)(4n-1) + 2 - n ] Hence: [ k leq (n-1)(4n-1) ] This contradiction can only be resolved if: [ k = (n-1)(4n-1) ] 4. **Constructive Example for k = (n-1)(4n-1):** Consider labeling the vertices of the polygon as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{4n-1}. Construct subsets S_{(i,j)} as follows: [ S_{(i,j)} = {A_i A_{i+j}, A_{i+j-1}A_{i+2n}} ] When k > 4n-1, we identify A_k = A_{k-4n+1}. For i = 1, 2, ldots, 4n-1 and j = 2, 3, ldots, n, 5. **Verification:** - There are (n-1)(4n-1) non-interacting sets of diagonals. - Every pair of S_{(i,j)} and S_{(m,n)} interact with at least one intersecting diagonal. Consequently, S = cup S_{(i,j)} meets the partition conditions. By cyclic symmetry, setting i = 0, each set S_{(0,j)} must include a diagonal from below: [ {A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{j-1}}, quad {A_j, A_{j+1}, ldots, A_{2n}}, quad {A_{2n}, A_{2n+1}, ldots, A_{4n}} ] None of these sets can cover all points from diagonals exceeding the consecutive spans of 2n.

Begin with the understanding that a cube with a side length of 3 inches needs to be divided into smaller cubes with side lengths of 1 inch. Therefore, the original cube of volume (3^3 = 27) cubic inches will be cut into 27 smaller cubes, each of volume (1^3 = 1) cubic inch. 2. Let's consider the most efficient way to cut the cube. Each cut can be considered a plane cutting through the cube. 3. Initially, if we make one cut, the cube can be divided into two pieces. - This first plane will effectively reduce the cube into two rectangular prisms of sizes (3 times 3 times 1) inch and (3 times 3 times 2) inch. 4. Next, if we cut the (3 times 3 times 2) inch prism once, it will be divided into two prisms: (3 times 3 times 1) inch each, totaling three (3 times 3 times 1) inch parts. - So far, with two cuts, we have 3 pieces of (3 times 3 times 1) inch. 5. For splitting each (3 times 3 times 1) inch prism into 1-inch cubes, we need to make 2 cuts parallel to the 3-inch side for each of the three prisms that were divided initially. - To split the first (3 times 3 times 1) inch part into smaller 1-inch cubes, we need two cuts. - These cuts will create 3 layers of (1 times 3 times 1) inch pieces, each containing 3 small cubes, resulting in 9 cubes. - Similarly, the second and the third (3 times 3 times 1) inch prisms would also need two cuts each, similarly forming 9 small cubes each. 6.

Clearly, ({{a_{n+1}}-frac{1}{2}{a_n}}) > ({{a_n}-frac{1}{2}{a_{n-1}}}), confirming option C is correct. **Option D:** Given {S_n}=2{a_n}-{2^{n+1}}-t, - For n=1, a_{1}=4+t. - For n geqslant 2, {a_n}-{2^n}=2{a_{n-1}} implies frac{{{a_n}}{{2^n}}}-frac{{{a_{n-1}}}{{2^{n-1}}}}=1. This shows left{{frac{{{a_n}}{{2^n}}}}right} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, leading to frac{{{a_n}}{{2^n}}}=n+frac{1}{2}t+1. Thus, {a_n}={2^n}(n+frac{1}{2}t+1). For n geqslant 2, the inequality 8(n+frac{1}{2}t+2)-2(n+frac{1}{2}t+1) > 4(n+frac{1}{2}t+1)-(n+frac{1}{2}t) simplifies to t > frac{{-6n-20}}{3}.

The problem is to determine whether you can consistently pay your monthly rent, given that you initially have a single bill of 1000 francs, and considering the rent is a constant amount in Switzerland with an infinite time horizon. 1. **Initial Bill and Rent Payment**: - Suppose you have a 1000 franc bill. - To pay the rent each month, you would need to convert this bill into smaller denominations. - Let's start by assuming you can break the 1000 franc bill into smaller denominations like 500 francs, 100 francs, 50 francs, etc. 2. **Converting Denominations**: - If you can break a 1000 franc bill into two 500 franc bills, and then break a 500 franc bill into smaller denominations (down to as small as needed for exact rent payment). 3. **General Case Analysis**: - Consider breaking down to the smallest unit that can pay any amount. The smallest denomination typically would be the 1 centime. - If you hypothetically break the 1000 franc bill down into 1 centime coins, you would be able to use those coins for housing payments of any amount since the smallest unit can sum up to the rent exactly. 4. **Recursive Breakdown**: - The ATM allows you to repeatedly break down bills into smaller and smaller denominations. - Let's assume each breakdown step: 1000 franc → smaller bills → even smaller bills until you reach the desired sum for rent. 5. **Issue of Finiteness**: - While theoretically, you might think about breaking down to 1 centime, practically, you cannot break down indefinitely in a finite manner and still have an endless supply with the limited operations given. - This recursion suggests infinitely breaking down which cannot actually achieve an infinite supply of rent payments in a practical sense. 6. **Conclusion**: - The initial solution suggests checking the sufficiency of one centime coin but finds it wrong, indicating a limitation in the real-world context to divide infinitely.

However, the statement implies all curves in this range are ellipses, not specifically mentioning circles as a subset. This could be misleading since it doesn't explicitly acknowledge the special case of a circle. Therefore, while technically, a circle is an ellipse, the statement's lack of specificity makes it less accurate. **B: If t < 1, then C is a hyperbola.** - For t < 1, we have 5-t > 0 and t-1 < 0. This means the denominators in the equation have opposite signs, leading to one positive and one negative term on the left side of the equation. This is characteristic of a hyperbola. Thus, this statement is boxed{text{correct}}. **C: If C is a hyperbola, then the focal length is 4.** - Considering t=0 as a specific case where C is a hyperbola, we can analyze the equation to determine the focal length.

Therefore, this statement is boxed{text{incorrect}} without needing to calculate the focal length for every possible value of t. **D: If C is an ellipse with the focus on the y-axis, then 3 < t < 5.** - For an ellipse with its focus on the y-axis, the larger denominator must correspond to the y^2 term, implying t-1 > 5-t > 0.

If the interest rate was 5% higher per year, it would have fetched an additional ₹2500 at maturity. What was the sum invested initially?","completion":"Let's denote the initial sum invested as P, and the original interest rate as r (in decimal form). The compound interest formula is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where: A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money) r = annual interest rate (in decimal) n = number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the time the money is invested for in years In this case, the interest is compounded annually (n = 1), and the time is t = 15 years. Let's first write the equation for the amount at maturity with the original interest rate: A1 = P(1 + r)^15 Now, if the interest rate was 5% higher, the new rate would be r + 0.05. The new amount at maturity would be: A2 = P(1 + r + 0.05)^15 We are given that A2 is ₹2500 more than A1: A2 = A1 + 2500 Substituting the expressions for A1 and A2, we get: P(1 + r + 0.05)^15 = P(1 + r)^15 + 2500 Now, we can divide both sides by P to get rid of P: (1 + r + 0.05)^15 = (1 + r)^15 + 2500/P Since we don't know the original rate r, we can't solve for P directly. However, we can make an assumption that the original interest rate r is not relevant to the calculation of P because the increase in interest rate is a fixed 5% and the time period is fixed at 15 years. This means the effect of the increase in interest rate on the final amount should be the same regardless of the original rate. So, we can simplify the equation by assuming r = 0 for the purpose of calculating P: (1 + 0.05)^15 = 1 + 2500/P Now, calculate (1 + 0.05)^15: (1.05)^15 Using a calculator, we find: (1.05)^15 ≈ 2.07893 Now, we have: 2.07893 = 1 + 2500/P Subtract 1 from both sides: 2.07893 - 1 = 2500/P 1.07893 = 2500/P Now, solve for P: P = 2500 / 1.07893 P ≈ 2317.97 So, the initial sum invested was approximately boxed{₹2317.97} ."},{"prompt":"f the slope k of the line l is in the interval (1, sqrt{3}), then the range of values for the inclination angle of the line l is ( ).

The slope k is given by the tangent of the inclination angle, i.e., k = tan(alpha). The inclination angle alpha is defined to be in the interval [0, pi) because a line in a two-dimensional plane can have an angle ranging from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including pi radians with the positive direction of the x-axis. Given that the slope k of the line l is in the interval (-1, sqrt{3}), we can write this condition in terms of the tangent function as: -1 < k < sqrt{3} Substituting k = tan(alpha) into the inequality, we get: -1 < tan(alpha) < sqrt{3} This inequality tells us about the range of values that alpha can take. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants and positive in the first and third quadrants of the unit circle. The value of tan(alpha) crosses -1 at alpha = frac{3pi}{4} (in the second quadrant) and sqrt{3} at alpha = frac{pi}{3} (in the first quadrant). Therefore, for tan(alpha) to be between -1 and sqrt{3}, alpha must be in the interval [0, frac{pi}{3}) for the first quadrant, and there is no portion of the interval in the second quadrant that satisfies the inequality. In the third quadrant, the tangent function is negative, and in the fourth quadrant, it does not reach -1 before the angle alpha reaches pi. Thus, the only additional portion that satisfies the condition is (frac{3pi}{4}, pi), where the tangent function is again between -1 and sqrt{3}.

To ensure the fly passes through the circle's points, we need to count the paths that pass through any of these points and then continue to (8,10). For each key point, calculate the path to (8,10) and then sum over all of them. 3. For each key point: - For example: to pass through (4,5): - First, calculate paths to (4,5) - Then calculate paths from (4,5) to (8,10) - Combine and sum for all paths passing through the valid points For a typical path such as (4,5), we make the calculation using binomial coefficients: Summarizing for all involved paths, let’s denote: [ text{Total paths} = sum left(C_{9-i}^{i} cdot C_{9}^{6-i} right) ] Where (i) ranges over each relevant case and then simplify/summing it all together: [ frac{2 C_{9}^{2} C_{9}^{3} + 2 C_{9}^{3} C_{9}^{4} + left(C_{9}^{4}right)^{2}}{2^{18}} approx 0.164 ] Conclusion: (boxed{frac{2 C_{9}^{2} C_{9}^{3} + 2 C_{9}^{3} C_{9}^{4} + left(C_{9}^{4}right)^{2}}{2^{18}}})"},{"prompt":"Madelyn and Serenity decided to play chess but found that some pieces were missing.

This immediately gives: [ m^2 - n^2 = p ] From the difference of squares, we know: [ m^2 - n^2 = (m+n)(m-n) = p ] 3. **Prime factor properties**: Since ( p ) is a prime number, it must have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself (( p )). Thus, we have two possibilities to split ( p ): [ m - n = 1 quad text{and} quad m + n = p ] 4. **Solving the equations**: From the equations ( m - n = 1 ) and ( m + n = p ), we can solve for ( m ) and ( n ): [ m - n = 1 implies m = n + 1 ] [ m + n = p implies (n + 1) + n = p implies 2n + 1 = p implies n = frac{p - 1}{2} ] 5. **Restriction on ( n ) and ( p )**: The solutions are possible only if ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ) is a natural number.

Let's prove that 2^{n+1} boxers can be ordered in (n+1) days. 1. **Divide and Order Groups:** - Split the 2^{n+1} boxers into two groups, each with 2^n boxers. - According to the induction hypothesis, we can order the boxers within each group by their strength in n days. 2. **Merge the Groups:** - To finalize the order of all 2^{n+1} boxers, in one additional day, arrange the boxers such that for each boxer in one group, we identify his position relative to the corresponding boxers in the other group. This involves up to 2^n comparisons. Thus, the total days required will be (n + 1) which completes the inductive step. **Application to the Problem:** Let us consider our original problem with 32 boxers (2^5 participants): 1. **Tournament Structure:** - We organize a knockout tournament such that each of the 32 participants' strengths are tested. Since we need to find the outright strongest boxer: - In the first round, 32 boxers will compete in 16 matches. Each winner advances, resulting in 16 winners (1 day). - The winners will compete in the second round, forming 8 matches with 8 winners advancing (2 days in total). - Continuing similarly, we proceed to: - Third round: 4 matches, 4 winners (3 days). - Fourth round: 2 matches, 2 winners (4 days). - Fifth round: 1 match determining the strongest boxer (5 days). 2. **Finding the Second Strongest Boxer:** - To determine the second strongest boxer: - The boxer who lost to the champion in the final match is a candidate. - The boxers who lost to the champion in any of the previous rounds are also considered. 3. **Continue This Process:** - By iterating this process and applying the lemma, we understand that: - Each round effectively halves the number of remaining boxers to be ordered. Each complete ordering requires (n + 1) rounds where n is the number of \\"team-size halving.\\" Thus, within 15 days, following the lemma and strategy for ordering and knockout tournaments, it's achievable to determine the rank ordering of the 32 boxers. # Conclusion: After careful steps and inductive reasoning supporting the lemma, we conclude that the entire process of determining the strongest ordering among 32 boxers can be completed within 15 days. boxed{text{15 days}}"},{"prompt":"trapezoid ( ABCD ), point ( X ) is taken on the base ( BC ) such that segments ( XA ) and ( XD ) divide the trapezoid into three similar but pairwise unequal, nonisosceles triangles.

In the trapezoid (ABCD), we are given a point (X) on the base (BC) such that the segments (XA) and (XD) divide the trapezoid into three similar but non-equilateral triangles.

Note that the given problem specifically mentions that these triangles are non-equilateral and that all the angles in these triangles are different: - Let (alpha = angle BXA = angle XAD) - Let (beta = angle AXD neq alpha) 3. The third angle in triangle (triangle CXD), (angle CXD), is supplementary to these angles and thus it must be different from (alpha) and (beta). 4. Suppose (angle BAX = beta), we observe that in triangles (BAX) and (DAX): - They share an angle (alpha) and the angle (angle BAX = angle DAX = beta). - By Angle-Angle (AA) similarity condition, triangles (BAX) and (DAX) would have been similar, contradicting the condition that none of the triangles are congruent. 5. Therefore, (angle BAX) cannot be (beta). Let’s assume (angle BAX = gamma). As a result, (angle ABC = beta). By similar logic, we can determine: - (angle XDC = alpha) - (angle XCD = beta) 6. Since both angles at the ends of base (BC) are equal, the trapezoid (ABCD) is isosceles, meaning (AB = CD). 7.

As a result, for every 1 yuan reduction in the price of type A souvenir, 4 more units were sold, and for every 1 yuan increase in the price of type B souvenir, 2 fewer units were sold. If on a certain day, a total of 140 souvenirs were sold, what was the maximum profit made on that day?","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): Finding the Cost Price for Each Type of Souvenir Let's denote the cost price for each type A souvenir as x yuan. Given that the cost price for each type B souvenir is 9 yuan more than that of type A, we can express it as (x + 9) yuan. The total cost for type A souvenirs is given as 10400 yuan, and for type B souvenirs, it's 14000 yuan. Since the quantities of both types of souvenirs are equal, we can set up the following equation based on their costs: [ frac{10400}{x} = frac{14000}{x + 9} ] Solving this equation for x, we multiply both sides by x(x + 9) to eliminate the denominators: [ 10400(x + 9) = 14000x ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 10400x + 93600 = 14000x ] Subtracting 10400x from both sides: [ 93600 = 3600x ] Dividing by 3600: [ x = 26 ] Therefore, the cost price for each type A souvenir is 26 yuan, and for type B, it's x + 9 = 26 + 9 = 35 yuan. boxed{text{The cost price for each type A souvenir is 26 yuan, and for each type B souvenir is 35 yuan.}} Part (2): Maximizing the Profit Let the price reduction for type A souvenir be m yuan, and the price increase for type B souvenir be n yuan.

The profit can be calculated as: [ w = (46 - m - 26) times (40 + 4m) + (45 + n - 35) times (80 - 2n) ] Substituting n = 2m - 10 into the profit equation: [ w = -4m^2 - 2(2m - 10)^2 + 40m + 60(2m - 10) + 1600 ] Simplifying: [ w = -12m^2 + 240m + 800 ] [ w = -12(m - 10)^2 + 2000 ] The maximum profit, w, occurs when the square term is zero, i.e., when m = 10.

Simplifying the function using trigonometric formulas is key to solving this problem. **Solution** Simplify the function f(x)=sin (omega x+varphi)+cos (omega x+varphi)= sqrt{2} sin (omega x+varphi+ frac{pi}{4} ), Since f(x) is an odd function, then varphi+ frac{pi}{4} =kpi, kinmathbb{Z}.

It is required to schedule buses such that they run at regular intervals of T minutes and none of the buses are delayed at the crossing. For which intervals between buses, less than half an hour, is it possible to schedule their movement in this way?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** There is a highway where buses travel around the clock, intersecting a railway. Each hour, there are two trains passing the highway at precise times: - One train at exactly n hour, - Another train at n hour and 38 minutes for n ranging from 0 to 23 hours. Whenever a train passes, a barrier is lowered for 5 minutes. We need to schedule the bus departures such that no bus is delayed by the barrier, with a constant interval T between buses. The interval T needs to be less than 30 minutes. 2. **Barrier Closing Times:** The barrier is closed during the following intervals within each hour: - From 0 min to 5 min, - From 38 min to 43 min. 3. **Avoiding the Barrier:** To ensure that no bus is delayed by the barrier, none of the bus times should fall within these two intervals. Define ( t_0 ) as the minute when the first bus passes through the intersection, and the subsequent buses pass every ( T ) minutes. 4. **Marking the Forbidden Times:** On a clock face (or circle representing the 60 minutes), we mark the forbidden intervals: - A segment from 0 to 5 minutes, - Another segment from 38 to 43 minutes. 5. **Finding the Appropriate Interval ( T ):** We need to find values of ( T ) such that the buses avoid the forbidden intervals.

We need the gaps (arc lengths) between consecutive bus departure times to not intersect the shaded forbidden intervals. 7. **Calculation of Valid ( T ):** To ensure that no interval falls into the forbidden zones: - The circle should be divided into an integer number ( k ) of segments such that each segment is at least 6 minutes long (as 5 minutes of a forbidden zone plus 1-minute buffer to avoid nearby times). 8. **Permissible Segments:** Calculate the permissible ( T ): - For ( t_0 approx 6 ) min intervals (to fit within allowed zones), Valid ( T ) can be found by ensuring that the multiples of ( T ) modulo 60 avoid the forbidden times. 9. **Valid Intervals:** Based on the calculations and constraints:: - ( T = 20 ) minutes ( left(frac{60}{3}right) ), - ( T = 15 ) minutes ( left(frac{60}{4}right) ), - ( T = 12 ) minutes ( left(frac{60}{5}right) ), - ( T = 10 ) minutes ( left(frac{60}{6}right) ), - ( T = frac{60}{8} = 7.5 ) minutes, - ( T = frac{60}{11} approx 5.45 ) minutes. 10. **Conclusion:** By these calculations, the feasible intervals ( T ) wherein the bus rounds avoid the forbidden closures are: - ( T = 20 ) minutes, - ( T = 15 ) minutes, - ( T = 12 ) minutes, - ( T = 10 ) minutes, - ( T = 7 frac{1}{2} ) minutes, - ( T = 5 frac{5}{11} ) minutes.

Then a_{n+1} = a_n + 1 and b_{n+1} = b_n - 1. - Hence, starting from index k, a_n would increase without bound, and b_n would decrease linearly. - Specifically, b_{k + b_k} = b_k - b_k = 0, which is a contradiction since b_n must be strictly positive. 4. **Behavior of descents**: - Observing examples, it seems that the a_n values decrease when n is a descent. - Define {n_k} as the strictly increasing sequence of descents. - We aim to show a_{n_k} geq a_{n_{k+1}}. 5. **Analyzing descents**: - Suppose n_k is a descent.

Masha wants to move one flower from each vase to the next vase in the clockwise direction such that the number of both white and red roses changes in every vase.

By asking 1003 questions, we can ensure that each number appears in at least one of the sets, allowing us to identify all 2005 numbers. 3. **Proving the Lower Bound:** We need to show that 1003 questions are necessary.

Note that ( t_{2n+1} = 0 ). 4. **Express ( F ) in terms of partial sums:** We can rewrite ( F ) using the partial sums: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} s_i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{2n} t_i^2 = (2n+1) sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i^2 + sum_{1 le r < s le 2n} (4n + 2 - 2s + 2r)x_rx_s. ] Simplifying, we get: [ (2n+1) sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i^2 - 2F + (2n+2) sum_{1 le r < s le 2n} x_rx_s. ] 5. **Further simplification:** Using the identity ( sum_{1 le r < s le 2n} x_rx_s = frac{1}{2} left( left( sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i right)^2 - sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i^2 right) ), we get: [ (2n+1) sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i^2 - 2F + (2n+2) left( frac{1}{2} left( left( sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i right)^2 - sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i^2 right) right). ] 6. **Combine terms:** Simplifying further, we have: [ (n+1) left( sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i right)^2 - 2F + 2n^2. ] Rearranging, we get: [ 2F = 2n^2 + (n-1) left( sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i right)^2 - sum_{i=1}^{2n-1} (s_i^2 + t_{i+1}^2). ] 7. **Minimize the sum of squares:** Note that ( s_i + t_{i+1} = sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i ). Therefore, [ frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i right)^2 - s_i^2 - t_{i+1}^2 = -frac{1}{2} (s_i - t_{i+1})^2. ] Thus, [ 2F = 2n^2 - sum_{i=1}^{2n} frac{1}{2} (s_i - t_{i+1})^2. ] 8. **Optimize the arrangement:** To minimize the sum of squares, we should have ( s_i - t_{i+1} ) change by ( pm 2 ) as ( i ) increases by 1. This implies an alternating pattern of ( pm 2 ), 0, ( pm 2 ), 0, etc. This gives: [ 2F le 2n^2 - 2n, ] or [ F le n(n-1). ] 9. **Verify the maximum value:** To show this is achievable, take ( x_i ) to be ( 1, -1, 1, -1, cdots ).

Let the 2n+1 numbers be denoted as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n+1} ) such that ( a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{2n+1} ). This ordering will help us to understand the relative magnitude of the numbers when comparing sums. 2. According to the problem, the sum of any ( n+1 ) of these numbers is always greater than the sum of the remaining ( n ) numbers. Since this property holds for any combination of ( n+1 ) numbers, we consider the sum of the first ( n+1 ) numbers compared to the last ( n ): [ a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{n+1} geq a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} + ldots + a_{2n+1} ] 3. To isolate ( a_1 ), we need to subtract the terms ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{n+1} ) from both sides of the inequality: [ a_1 geq (a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} + ldots + a_{2n+1}) - (a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{n+1}) ] 4.

Since the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n+1} ) is sorted in non-decreasing order, we know that: [ a_{n+2} geq a_2, , a_{n+3} geq a_3, , ldots, , a_{2n+1} geq a_{n+1} ] Hence, each of the differences ( a_{n+2} - a_2, , a_{n+3} - a_3, ldots, , a_{2n+1} - a_{n+1} ) is non-negative. 6. Therefore, the sum of these non-negative differences is greater than or equal to zero, implying: [ a_1 geq 0 ] 7. Since the sequence is sorted and each element is at least zero, this means that the smallest number ( a_1 ) is non-negative, which translates to all numbers being positive (because if the smallest number is actually positive rather than zero, all others following the smallest number in a non-decreasing order must be positive as well). Conclusion, we have demonstrated that all the numbers must be non-negative, and since ( a_1 geq 0 ) by order, all ( a_i geq a_1 ), thus all ( a_i ) are positive (considering none are zero).

If there exists an integer ( y_0 ) such that ( p mid (2y_0 - 1)^2 + 3^2 cdot 11 ): - Suppose ( b_1 = 2m + 1 ) where ( m ) is an integer. Then: [ 2b_1 y_0 - b_1 = 2(2m + 1)y_0 - (2m + 1) = 2[(2m + 1)y_0 - m] - 1 ] - Let ( x_0 = (2m + 1)y_0 - m ), then: [ p mid (2x_0 - 1)^2 + 11 ] 7. **If there exists ( x_0 ) such that ( p mid (2x_0 - 1)^2 + 11 ), let ( y_0 = 3x_0 - 1):** - Then: [ p mid 3^2((2x_0 - 1)^2 + 11) = (2(3x_0 - 1) - 1)^2 + 3^2 cdot 11 ] - Consequently: [ p mid (2y_0 - 1)^2 + 3^2 cdot 11 ] 8.

First, consider the expression inside the cotangent function: [ 2x(eta(x + 3pi) - eta(x - 6pi)) ] The Heaviside function (eta(x + 3 pi)) is equal to 1 for (x geq -3 pi) and is equal to 0 for (x < -3 pi).

Consider the initial pile of 660 rocks. Let's assume the rocks are divided into the maximum possible number of piles. Let the smallest pile contain (m) rocks. By the problem's condition, all piles contain fewer than (2m) rocks. 2. We can look at this process in reverse: Let's combine pairs of piles to form new piles. Notice that if the current minimum number of rocks in a pile is (m), then the resulting new pile will have at most (2m) rocks. Also, once we have obtained a pile with (2m) rocks, there cannot be any remaining piles with exactly (m) rocks. 3. This means that after each combination operation, the minimum number of rocks in any pile increases. Specifically, after (k) operations, the minimum number increases by at least (k). 4. Therefore, in the original set, there were at most (2k) numbers within the interval ([m, m+k)). This implies that if we order the original set of numbers in ascending order: - The first number will be at most (m), - The third number will be at most (m+1), - The fifth number will be at most (m+2), - and so on. 5.

However, for simplicity and as the specific requirement to derive specific numeric conditions on a here is cumbersome, we proceed by using symmetry and simplicity: - Assume symmetric roots such as p=q and r=-2p which satisfy pq+qr+rp = 0 i.e., p^2 - 2p^2 = 0. Substituting in p+q+r=a gives 0 = a, an invalid case as pqr neq 0. Consider the case where one of the roots equals zero, i.e., p = 0, which implies q+r = a and qr = -3a. If q = -3k, and r = k, then -3k + k = a implies -2k = a yielding -3k^2 = -3a implies 3k^2 = 3a implies k^2 = a. Testing integer values of k, remains consistent, gives us a = 1, 4, 9, 16 assuming k = -1, -2, -3, -4 respectively. Summing these values gives: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30. Thus, the sum of all possible values of a such that x^3 - ax^2 + 3a has integer zeros is boxed{30}."},{"prompt":"Five friends gathered and had the following conversation: Andrey: I know the secret!

We start by analyzing the statements made by the friends: - Andrey: \\"I know the secret!\\" - Borya (to Andrey): \\"You do not know!\\" - Vitya: \\"Borya, you are wrong!\\" - Gosha (to Vitya): \\"You are wrong!\\" - Dima: \\"You are lying, Gosha!\\" 2. The problem statement mentions that more than half of the friends are telling the truth. Since there are 5 friends, more than half means at least 3 of them are telling the truth. Let's test the two possibilities: 3. **Assumption 1:** Andrey is lying: - If Andrey is lying, then he does not know the secret. - Borya said Andrey does not know the secret. Therefore, Borya is telling the truth. - Vitya said Borya is wrong. Therefore, Vitya is lying. - Gosha said Vitya is wrong. Therefore, Gosha is telling the truth. - Dima said Gosha is lying. Therefore, Dima is lying. If Andrey is lying: [ begin{array}{l} text{Andrey} quad (text{Lie}) text{Borya} quad (text{Truth}) text{Vitya} quad (text{Lie}) text{Gosha} quad (text{Truth}) text{Dima} quad (text{Lie}) end{array} ] - Here, we have 3 people lying (Andrey, Vitya, Dima) and only 2 telling the truth (Borya, Gosha). This contradicts our condition that more than half of the friends are telling the truth. Therefore, Andrey cannot be lying. 4. **Assumption 2:** Andrey is telling the truth: - If Andrey is telling the truth, then he knows the secret. - Borya said Andrey does not know the secret. Therefore, Borya is lying. - Vitya said Borya is wrong. Therefore, Vitya is telling the truth. - Gosha said Vitya is wrong. Therefore, Gosha is lying. - Dima said Gosha is lying. Therefore, Dima is telling the truth. If Andrey is telling the truth: [ begin{array}{l} text{Andrey} quad (text{Truth}) text{Borya} quad (text{Lie}) text{Vitya} quad (text{Truth}) text{Gosha} quad (text{Lie}) text{Dima} quad (text{Truth}) end{array} ] - Here, we have 3 people telling the truth (Andrey, Vitya, and Dima) and 2 lying (Borya, Gosha). This satisfies our condition that more than half of the friends are telling the truth. 5. Conclusion: The only consistent scenario with the given condition is when Andrey is telling the truth. Therefore, Andrey knows the secret.
