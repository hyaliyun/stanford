of the people who are shaping the future of artificial intelligence technology and Beyond I am your host and today we have the privilege of sitting down with a guest who is at the Forefront of integrating large language models like gp4 mestral Gemini into our everyday lives his name is Harrison Chase if you haven't heard about him he is the Visionary co-founder and CEO of Lang chain now Lang chain is probably the most popular framework that allows software engineers and developers to integrate large language models into the new generation of applications these applications range from assistants that can chat with you over your private data like how we have shown here in the channel and to all the way to autonomous agents that can reason and take action by themselves depending on your instructions and much more today we will dive deep into Harrison SP for the future of AI the challenges and triumphs of building Lang chain and his insights on the evolving landscape of large language models and generative AI so without any further Ado I bring you haris and [Music] [Music] Chase all right there we go great well Harrison thank you for thank you for being here uh it's an honor thanks for having me great it's an honor thank you very much for for coming and um yeah I'll be asking you some some questions about on Lang chain and about your your career and uh your Insight about the entire AI industry and what you see coming the future so um very happy great so well let's start off with um having you describe uh what you do in a few words I mean Lang chain and in general what you have have been uh working on it's been more than a year already that you have been on this so um why don't you start with that yeah it's been a little over a year so Lang chain started as an open source project to make it easy to build llm applications um so uh yeah launched in late October early November of 2022 um as a side project just a python package uh that yeah had a bunch of like Integrations with various components that are common for building Alama applications and then a few specific ways to construct these into what we called chains um hence the name kind of Lang chain language chain um and since then uh it's turned into a company so we started a company around it in uh late January of 2023 so a little over a year ago and now we have python package which is a big Focus we have a JavaScript package which is also a big focus and then we also have laying Smith which is a platform um for logging observability testing eval of uh llm applications in general um so yeah at a high level that's uh that that's what Lang chain is as the company and then I'm sure we'll dive into all the components in more detail yeah I mean it's amazing that um you have managed to go from one package to this entire ecosystem of uh tools that are capable of building this very cool applications I mean I think it speaks to the early nature of like it's just so early in the space right so like I I start I didn't start lingin with the intent of starting a but when I when I um you know after playing around in the space more and after building with it more it became pretty quickly apparent that one like you know llms are going to be a big deal um and and change a lot of things and two it's just like so early on in the space and so because of that there's just so many tools and helpful things that need to be built that are you know Lang train the orch rtion layer that is just one part of what's needed to build llm apps and then the second big part which we saw was basically these apps were you know really hard to get reliable they have these like random non-deterministic things at the center of them and so we recognize that pretty early on built Lan SP pretty early on and you know I'm sure there's going to be more tooling that's needed but yeah I think it just speaks to the fact that it's super early on and so there's a lot of ways to provide value a lot of uh new tools coming on in on the Ling side um I mean you know I think definitely a lot of like changes and improvements to Lane chain and Link Smith like Lan chain right now is very different than L chain when it first launched right it has to be um and so I we'll continue to push it we'll continue to focus on specific areas that we see being kind of like focuses and add more tooling around that for sure and then On LAN Smith there's uh uh yeah there's a lot more features we we are going to add there we we want to add there um again it's just so early that you know observability and testing is a great start but there's just a lot more to be built in this area yeah um about that like Lang chain how how did the idea come to you did I mean was it some some sort of a realization like one day you were like I wish this existed or was it more gradual uh that you started building it how did it go yeah it wasn't um basically I was going to a bunch of hackathons um and meetups in the space talking to folks I knew I was going to leave my previous job but I didn't know what I was going to do um and so I was just exploring um and as part of that exploration you know talk to a bunch of folks who were building early applications and saw them doing similar things that Ling chain would would end up helping enable um and so I think the thought process thought process wasn't really too grandiose it was like hey there's some common abstractions in terms of how people are doing things wouldn't it be cool as a as a weak side project to pull these out into a package and put it out in the world and that's really how it started right yeah I mean it's it's definitely become I mean since then it's become a very mature product I would say um more mature at least I constantly only getting more and more mature I mean after over a year how would you say that your vision of uh Lang chain has changed because I mean I suppose that it's not the same as it was like a few months after you founded a company yeah vision of the open source or vision of the company I mean in general um in general yeah yeah you know I think there are a few like specific areas that we have more confidence in as being like high value like I think like right after we started the company the main thing that we knew is that it was really early on in the space um and so there was a lot of hypotheses we had um and and I think now we know a little bit more about what it means to be able to build reliable app in the space so like on the L train side you know we've been really focused on kind of like structured output so so uh making it really easy to use all LS to Output structur data we see this being a huge use case um especially where Lang chain plays which is like using language models to call other things and do other things you need to Output it in some structured format so that's been a huge focus of ours um we've we've uh added a bunch of stuff around streaming um so we think streaming not just of but of the inter immediate results as well is really important as you have longer running applications so like that's you know something we've updated our belief is is really important and um uh retrieval is really important um I think if you asked me that last year I'd probably say that as well some updated believe you know now now uh one aspect of that that we're really focused on is the query analysis part um so we think like basically taking a raw user query and then converting it into a more like optimized query in some way um we think big piece and likely to be here for a while so we're really focused on that right right can you give an example of what that what that means a little bit more in detail yeah yeah absolutely so I think maybe um the easiest example to understand is so a lot of rag applications take a user query um and then they basically the the you know the typical method is to look it look up against documents that are in a vector store so you have a numerical representation for each document you create a numerical representation for the user query you find the ones that are most similar right uh but often times queries can in and backing up like that embedding similarities really good for kind of like comparing the semantic uh nature of two documents against each other um but oftentimes queries contain information that is not really semantic but rather more precise so an example could be um like you know what are movies about aliens in the Year 1980 so 1980 isn't like a semantic bit you want like you know you're asking for a specific filter and so like a query analysis step would basically take in that query and then spit out uh assuming that in our database we're able to filter on year of of publication for a movie it would spit out an optimized sarey where it would have like a query search string which maybe be like movies about aliens or if you have it's a movie database maybe it's just aliens um and then it has another filter that's uh uh you know release date equals 2010 and then you can pass that optimized query into the into the you know Vector store filtering on the release date and and get back results that are guaranteed to be that release date 201 right okay that's pretty cool at at some point in the I mean I had seen some interviews with you before and you were talking about some of the implementations of um Lang chain some really cool projects that you had seen in the past I heard you mention one say Dungeons and Dragons um master or something yeah um in I mean it's been a while since Lang's been out has your I mean have you encountered new or cool projects that have used langing to create their application or something yeah I mean I think there's a lot of cool projects and cool and different ways um so so I I I think the Dungeons and Dragons one is still one of my favorite for a few reasons like I think like one like uh you know is a creative application right and so I think creative applications are really good for llms because they're not perfect and they can mess up and in Creative applications that's totally okay and it can even sometimes be like a feature um but but I also think there's a lot of um there's a there's a lot of really tricky technical challenges to build a really good kind of like Dungeons and dragon Str Master mainly you need to kind of like maintain like the state of the world and keep track of that over time um and so I think that gets to like the idea of like long-term memory which is something we're really excited about and so so I think that's really interesting um you know I I think another example of kind of like cool applications for a different reason um are some of uh kind of like these are they're kind of like more complex one example would be a more complex kind of like customer support chatbot and that sounds really boring on face value right um and and and much less exciting than Dungeons and Dragons but but I think the reason why it's cool is that you know it's really easy to build a chat bot that's kind of like answering questions about documentation and so if that's what you have as a support bot right that's that's a little bit less exciting but oftentimes um you want your customer support bot to be able to do a multitude of different things it needs to know about the user that it's interacting with and it needs to like only be able to you know if you're if you're asking about like previous transactions you should only have access to data that to your transactions you shouldn't be able to ask questions about my transactions so there's so it's a bit more narrowly scoped in that way and and the way that we see people building these more complex Bots is often as kind of like more complex graphs or state machines kind of um so there's a lot of really uh cool kind of like flow engineering work that goes into creating these basically like State machines where you have a customer support bot that you know maybe you you you enter um and you're talking to like a generalist customer support bot but then you ask a question about a purchase order and it routes you to different one that knows how to deal with kind of like your previous order and then you ask a question about the current inventory and it routes you to a separate run right so you have these multiactor systems with some like flow set up between them and so there's some really complex engineering that goes in there and so well may not be as cool or sexy as a Dungeons and dragon thing um it uh I think it's still a pretty cool example of uh some complex engineering Plus llms have you seen some of those in production already yeah yeah cool uh they're using Lang chain some are yeah you know unfortunately not are but some definitely are yeah cuz I I saw like um on the previous information that you shared in previous interviews that most of these projects had not reached production level yet um so that has changed apparently since uh last year well so you know most uh so okay maybe a few things like uh I would say most still probably haven't reached production level but there definitely are some that are and so we're starting to see like what it takes to get successful and what success looks like um and then more generally yeah we're seeing we're seeing more and more of that recently so my my take on the both space is like you know chat gbd came out like November 2022 right um and so maybe from then until kind of like the summer there's like a massive kind of like rush in people exploring and trying out new things and tons of interests and people like trying all these wacky agent multi-agent type things um and and then around last summer I think people um you know became more focused on like okay so can any of these actually go to production like what are we putting that's in production and you know there were a few right away but those were more like simple single llm calls um and and so yeah I think from the summer so so I'd say like from the summer to maybe like o October November I would say uh uh yeah maybe like from the summer to November the space I think was a little bit quieter as people were trying to like figure this out and then roughly from like November till now I think there's been more and more companies that are putting things in in production so we did a case study with elastic um who launched kind of like a a chatbot answer questions like an an assistant style chatbot um and that's using link chain and I think that launched I forget the exact date but I think that was maybe like December January um right so we see a lot of these applications starting to come to fruition and and finally yeah finally that's awesome um and you mentioned that you're we're starting to see what kind of things um are required for this kind of applications to actually go to production what would you say that are the main challenges for this applications to actually make it to production level yeah great question um I think there's a few one is like what is the right like ux for these applications um so you know chat and I mean that in a few ways one like chat is a fine ux um and so a lot use that but a lot are experimenting with kind of like other uxs as well I'd say most have gone to production have still been chat um but people have been experimenting and trying to figure it out but even within chat um you know interacting with llms is different than interacting with traditional software or with humans and so people kind of like need to figure out how to interact with these things um and so you know there's there's we did we did an article uh with uh folks from Norwegian Cruise Line where they talked about their chatbot and and some of the UI things that they're doing like you can give people example questions they can ask right um so that they know how to use it um you can uh I mean you need to stream tokens so it doesn't seem like it's waiting forever kind of like basic stuff um but yeah there's there's uh some figuring out of that um and and then uh I think probably the biggest blocker is these applications like you can build a prototype really quickly but it's not kind of like at the level of accuracy where it's where that's good enough to send a production and so there's actually a lot of work that goes in to to tightening um that Gap and and improving the application um and so a lot of that is basically prompt engineering and flow engineering making sure you have the right context making sure the prompts are keep on improving maybe making sure you have the right few shot examples and and this is where Lang Smith um building comes in real Handy you can see exactly what's going on you can see the input and output at each step um uh you can you can enter into a playground play around with the prompt mess around with it from there um and and so you can you can create test sets which then allows you to like iterate with confidence as you kind of like uh change a prompt you can see whether it's improving or depring or sorry not improving um and yeah this type of like visibility um I think really provides you know it's still a lot of work don't get me wrong like it's not and that's why it's taking you know that's why it takes a while and but we see the best engineering teams kind of like get more rigorous about how they're testing get more rigorous about how they're debugging issues um and uh launch into production get feedback improve from there have this like tight feedback loop and and that that gets them to a point where they can say launch into production right um for those who are not familiar with it would you mind just giving a um a quick explanation of what Langs Smith is and how it works yeah absolutely so so Lang Smith is a platform that we're building it's independent of Lang chain so it works with or without L chain all right um uh one yeah a lot of people don't know that um but it's yeah it's completely API first so we we have a nice kind of like Python and typescript um sdks for it that uh you we have some methods for like you know patching the open AI client really easily so if you're using open AI directly and not using linkchain you can just use that or you can just log things directly um so basically what it is it's a loging platform you log you log kind of like runs and results there so runs from production you log there um runs from kind of like evaluation runs uh you log there and then you can easily inspect the results and so you can see exactly what's going on you can see the inputs and outputs at each step um you can track kind of like uh you can collect feedback there you can track feedback over time uh you can you can monitor kind of like the latency of your applications you can check it for errors um we also have uh other things like a prompt Hub where you can store inversion prompts um and then also an annotation Quee um where you can easily label some of this data that's coming in so we say that human label human annotation is is pretty needed useful for collect you a lot of the feedback on these data points right sounds like that's kind of a most for uh production application are you the the I mean I I really don't know is this the only application that does this in the market or are there on any other because I I don't really know about that there there so there are a lot of other similar ones I'd say that ours is the most complete in the sense that it does all these things that I just mentioned um I think you have other tools that are really focused on just kind of like the logging of single data points or just the monitoring of of like latency or just the testing of uh data sets um and and I think ours is unique and that it brings all these things together um or our this unique in two ways i' say one it brings all these things together and I think that's really important because I think this like flywheel between logging testing experimenting like all of that is super important to to get really tight and crisp um and then two ours is really focused on like multi-step applications so a lot of other um ones are focused on like like single llm calls right um but you know we're L chain so you know we need to build this to work with L chain um and L chain is a lot of like multi-step applications um and so I think we have by far the best support for that just given the nature of kind of like our Focus right okay that's uh yeah it sounds pretty much like it's a something that you would need for for production definitely I think it's a I think it's a very very good product it's a probably a better product than linkchain um it came we launched it it was in public data for a while but it's now generally available so everyone everyone just sign up and try it cool and um are do you have any other any other products that are in the works right now or is that your main focus for the moment that's the main focus for the moment right um okay continuing about the about the Lang chain ecosystem you have an immense number of um Integrations with super cool providers which one would you say that has uh brought the most value to the Lang chain ecosystem or which which Integrations like you can name a few that are the most interesting to use um I mean this okay a little bit self- serving but I think the one that's brought the most value is the laying Smith integration um but let's I I'll put that aside we already talked about about that um I mean I think the most you know the main new thing here are language models right so like all the Integrations with language models are probably the most important things there and we've invested we've invested a lot of work in our integration ecosystem so Eric on our team has done a fantastic job of you know we now have like integration packages with specific providers so they're like more reliable and more maintained um and so we've invested a lot of work in this particularly around the language models um and so you know probably the most used one is the open AI integration for sure um and so by that measure like you know that that we we actually do have a list of the most uh kind of like downloaded integration packages um openi is number one by far um but I think you know like uh any of the language M providers anthropic Google Nvidia Kier Azure like all of those have got to be up there um some of the more cool ones I think are the local model integration so like AMA is a a thing that can run models locally our integration with them I think is really popular and it's also really cool because it lets you run stuff locally and that's awesome right so I'd shout out them as being one of the more cool ones that people should check out cool and I mean there language models when you're within the langu framework um the idea is to make them interact with other providers not only for language models but for data store for stores for other tools which ones would you say that are the tools that have had the most success within the echosystem like which ones have attracted more people yeah so uh number one by far has got to be all kind of like the vector store tools um so one of the main things we see people building is chat over their documents right and so to do that Vector stores have emerged as the or or or databases that support Vector uh Vector Technology have emerged as kind of like the main way to do that um and so pine cone weeva troma redis like all of these whether they're Vector native or have added in Vector functionality um you know uh uh those have got to be the main class of tools that are used I'll I'll shout out a second one which is also search related tools um so we see applications that can interact with the web being really popular and so uh tavil AI is a great integration partner um and they have a great kind of like a web action same with EXA same with u.com and so those types of tools have have also been really popular um I I'll also say though that for um you know when we see people going into production often times the tools that they use are custom tools that they write um right because you know we have a bunch of generic tools like Google Maps and stuff like that but oftentimes we see people building custom applications with their data and so we've made it really easy to write your own custom tools and so that's often times that's by far what we see people using most in production with with the exception of like these Vector databases because those are there are a few people that maybe right there on Vector databases but for the most part people use ones that are yeah shelves yeah so you mentioned that apart from rag uh from yeah apart from rag you have web like searching the web applications do you see any other kind of applications where Lang chain um is useful for or are those the main two ones um I mean like I think the main so so I'd say the two main things that people build are and they you can think of them in the same way if if you really want to but one's kind of like rad style chop Bots and then the other kind of like assistants that can interact with various things um those things can be apis to search the web um right or to search their own data but there there are a long tale of other tools um but there it's it's like a long taale like a few people use this tool a few people use this other tool um but the the things that they're building are these kind of like assistant co-pilot like things where you say something then thinks about what to do do it takes some action it gets the response back it thinks about what to do again it gets the response back and then it returns to the user and so that that type of architecture um I think we've spent a lot of time making easy to build with Lang chain and Lang graph um and so you know the that that would be the main thing that people are building but there's so many different use cases for it like you can use it to do SQL question answering you can use it to do CSV question answering you can use it to do question answering over your documents you can use it to interact with an API um and then you know interacting with an API is incredibly horizontal and so there's all different types of apis so you know it's it's tough to but but and it's tough to come up with something more specific than that because people are using LMS for everything so I mean just just to to be sure that everyone understands what we're talking about here when you when we say rag would you mind explaining what rag is in simple terms Place yeah absolutely so rag stands for retrieval augmented generation the basic idea is that um when when you're chatting with an llm and you send a message in it responds based on stuff that it knows it's been trained on that's in its weights um and so that's great if it's been trained on data that's relevant it's not great if you're asking questions about data that model has not been trained on and so the most common way to overcome this issue is to use rag retrieval augmented generation which is where you first do a retrieval step and you fetch relevant documents um or relevant data I should say um and then basically you augment the generation of the llm which basically means you pass in these documents as part of the prompt to the llm and you say something like answer this question based only on the data below right so that allows you to chat with your private data and pretty much any data available yeah exactly and I think most people immediately think of chatting with like unstructured data but you could view SQL as a chatting with a SQL database as a type of rag um you could you know then then there's also uh like when I was talking about the assistance earlier you could also view the assistance as a type of rag and and you know I would say that's not the most common way that people do it there's and this gets to um you know probably like the main point of laying chain is that there's all these different architectures that your applications can take on they can take on like I'd say like assistants are specific type of architecture there's also another like the most common architecture is a much more simpler one for rag the most common rag architecture is a much more simpler one where you you don't have this assistant thing you just like look up data pass it to a prompt that's your final answer right and so that's really fast that's really simple but it doesn't handle like it doesn't handle edge cases well and things like that and so then basically people are people are experimenting with all these different architectures and that's what L chain and Lan graph make it easy to do they make it easy to build all these different architectures and and and use examples of these different architectures awesome all right at some point also you mentioned um that you had seen some applications that I mean the most oftenly used interface for these applications was chat what other interfaces do you see or have you seen either in production or in prototyping yeah I mean the the other most common one besides chat is just like there's a single text input and then you get back a response um so like a single turn chat or something like that but then you can like you can populate it with um any information um then there's also some that just like they they weave it into their application UI so they're not actually maybe changing their UI they're just surfacing things so they could be using it to like generate uh uh like summaries of a document and they show those generated summaries in the UI but like they were already showing the document anyway so it's just adding like another bar under it um and other than that like uh yeah chat's by far the most common right I wish there was more I wish there was more um good ones Rell recently announced like uh or they they shared something around like generative UI where you use an llm to generate the UI um but I still think that's pretty new I haven't seen that like actually in production um very cool but everything that most of the things we see in production are the chat right um I would like to know a little bit more about as well about your career and what you what you have done because I I wasn't able to find much information about that um mostly most most of the information online about you is about Lang chain but I would like to know how you got to to where you are today and um and yeah I mean some advice that you may have to people that would like to to go into the same field as you and yeah so if you would mind just sharing a little bit about your academic history or professional history uh what you have been doing before Lang chain yeah absolutely I studied stats and computer science in college um and really started actually doing stuff in uh because of sports analytics so I really liked Sports and I liked math and stats and so I started doing stuff with sports analytics that led to like uh learning uh how to code to do that and things like that um so uh studied stats in cassin college did a bunch of sports analytics um after graduating did not do Sports analytics but instead went to Keno um a fintech startup um was on the machine learning team there for about two and a half years um did some stuff in time series then uh led the entity linking team so some some NLP related stuff um around entity linking uh we were that was like a 60 person startup when I joined we then got acquired by S&P Global after about a year um stayed there for like another year and a half S&P Global very big company um and so you know after after that I knew I wanted to go someplace smaller so joined robust intelligence um as the second employee there my current co-founder anush was actually the third uh employee there so that's how we met each other um and yeah it was there for about three and a half years um by the time I left we were about six people and it's it was a company in the mlop space so basically we worked on like testing and validation of machine learning models um it was really cool the first year you know uh super early on we were interacting with a lot of like R&D Departments of of other companies we spent a lot of time doing like adversarial machine learning um so some some really cool stuff there um then we started building out a platform um so got to got to see that um that that was really fun in in the mlop space on on testing and validation of machine learning models um and yeah I don't know like you know I think I've always just done things that I've I think I've always done things that I enjoyed right like I got into this because Sports analytics and I really enjoyed that you still do some of that uh not really like I follow it Loosely for for a few years after college I did some stuff on the side um but not really anymore um and so I I don't know I'd say like uh do stuff that you like and then you'll you'll work hard at it more naturally and then if if you work hard at something for enough time you'll you'll get pretty good at it then you can you can get good enough to be dangerous and then you can start ACC company in the space or something like that so you've you've always been in in the machine on the machine learning side of uh of these products right yep yep you learning and ml op so more so on like the applied side of that I was I was never I was never like a good researcher or anything like right and would you say that your degree prepared you more for for that kind of job or more for the development software engineering side um so I think I think my degree was very helpful for a lot like the machine learning stuff um but I learned everything I know about software engineering at my first job like you know i' obviously coded before that but like never seriously and so um yeah learn learned everything um for Real about that um out of college right and I had one question here about um becoming an AI engineer like I mean this these new terms like they're since they're new they can mean so many different things depending on the company that's posting the job ad so so how would you define a job engineer and sorry an AI engineer and what they do yeah um I definitely don't have a very good description of that you know I think it's probably been like under a year since people started using that term I I would say like um it probably involves working with language models and integrating them into uh in an application um and so I think like you know the require skills are are probably good engineering skills um and as well as like good problem solving skills because I think working with llms is a lot like solving hard problems they it's it's you you like the space is just moving so fast you need to be able to like pick up new things quickly um debug things quickly and so yeah just like solid engineering skills and then good problem solving skills to to stay up to date with all the llm advances would you say that would you say that you have to stud computer science in order to actually participate in this new industry or what do you what is I don't think so I don't think so I think like um and there's also flavor like you know there there like I think there's some debate around like will prompt engineering alone kind of like be be be a job and I think if if there's a job engineer for or if there's a job wreck for prompt engineer like I don't even know if need to be able to code um but I think if we're talking about AI engineer you need to be able to code but you don't need to have like you can you can learn that without a degree right um and then yeah you you you need to figure out how to work with language models I don't want to say like you need to know how to work with language models because no one really knows how to work with language models and it's constantly changing um so I would not get intimidated by that so I think like I think probably in my mind the requirement is more about kind of like being a solid engineer and having good problem solving skills right and about that like how would you like where would you go to learn all of those those things like would you uh I mean is what I I guess what I'm trying to get to is is studying by yourself enough to get into the industry or do you need some sort of a an official diploma or something like that um yeah I mean I think uh so so for the kind of like understanding how to work with language models kind of things um like just play around with language models work with language models put stuff out on Twitter put stuff out in the open source like all a lot of the most interesting stuff with working with like language models is being done out in the open by random people on Twitter um for the engineering side of things um maybe maybe this is a bit of a uh uh an oldfashioned take but like I think you just need to work in the industry and and start start in a you know in in an entry-level position work with some really strong people get feedback constantly kind of like improve I think there is you know I think there's some stuff in engineering that you can only learn by doing and so I think it's just experience there and you know there's nothing there's no there's no kind of like shortcuts there yeah I totally agree with that totally and yeah I mean studying in college can take you somewhere but it's only by doing that you will learn yeah exactly yeah like that's why I said I really didn't know anything about engineering until I started actually like working full-time in in your journey as a like as an engineer um do have you had any mentors or role models that have shaped the way that you work today in like in engineering's part or like in general yeah yeah absolutely I think I think both of my first bosses at uh Keno were amazing and I look up to them a lot um uh Sam schlier is one of them he's now like he I think he's like founding uh member of the character team so they're doing awesome stuff he's I think he uh him him and and Mikey um Mikey scholman who's the CEO of suo Al another company in the geni space but both of them were like you know I I learned so much from them not only like the obviously like skills of engineering but also like mental models of how to think about engineering and how to think about leading engineering teams um and Lead engineering projects and stuff like that I think probably the biggest thing um that uh I think it was probably Sam mostly but but Mikey as well um I think really important it is this idea of like just like figuring out what the blockers are and doing just the blockers um like I think oftentimes you can over complicate things in engineering a lot um and especially in a space like AI engineering today where it's just so fast moving and you need to just like ship stuff get feedback iterate you really need to focus like okay what's actually the blockies here and what are we just like bike shedding is a complete waste of time um and so I think Sam and Mikey were both I I think that's probably like the strongest mental model that I took from them W yeah it's always I mean you always take from from people you've worked with yeah you want to borrow like death parts from everyone right then try to do that so I should work with people who are like better than you at at something and try to learn from them 100% yeah that would yeah that would for anyone like just like any new grads or anyone just getting into this field like 100% my advice would be like find really good people and just work with them and just focus on that and don't worry about uh you know don't worry about title don't worry about um you know with within reasons don't worry about title don't worry about uh comp work worry about working with really good people and learning and that will pay off like few years on the line yeah totally do you have any advice for like people who want like they know how to code they are starting off um with these new technologies they're creating these new products there prototypes and they want to build a company around it um do you have any advice to PE to people I mean for people who are kind of in this situation yeah I mean I I don't um I don't know if I have any good advice like my my story and I could share that um you know like I don't know how typical my story is I I can share it and the lessons I learned there but like any advice I have would be you know with that context in mind um and what I did was basically you know I I I built something that I enjoyed working on um and thought was useful um and then I shared it with the world you know I put it out on Twitter um I iterated on it quickly I I made like a release every day right um and eventually enough people started using it where it was feasible to start a company around it um and so um you know I I was in a fortunate position where I was you know uh still at another job at the time but I knew I was going to leave so I kind of like had had a a safety net but I also had the freedom to um you know before that I was I I worked a lot I worked hard right so I wasn't doing a lot of like side projects so I I was in a you know definitely unfortunate position I don't know how replicable that is but yeah the takeaways would probably be like ship it like right you got to you got to put it out there um iterate quickly like get feedback and iterate L really seek out feedback like I think I was pretty proactive about seeking out feedback and I think I think that helped improve it um and then yeah if if you build something that people want as cliche or you know much easier much easier said than done but if if if you do that I think um I think that helps yeah I I mean to me it's just uh impressive how so many stories start with uh the first tweet came out like on this day um I mean from the top of my head I can't actually remember a single one but um like it just comes so often in conversations that yeah it all started with the Tweet did you have like many followers or how did how did that like actually took take traction I had like 200 followers 250 um they were mostly from the sports analytics days um so it's actually funny when I look at the people that I follow like you know it's it's mostly AI people now but there's like some Rand Sports analytics people from way back in the day um and yeah I think what I you know I think the first thread I did was like 13 tweets or something right so it was pretty long and detailed um and I tagged a bunch of people in it it was you know I I think I'd implemented like three different papers and like seven different Integrations or something like that so I tagged all the authors I tagged the integration things um and yeah I guess that helped get enough people to see it and enough people liked it and and and retweeted it I think that it it got got some followers from that and then kept on follow uping follow following reading about it and yeah yeah but it was just like consistent right like you got to do something every day you got to make progress like I mean it's it's it's still impressive the thing I mean the open source part right because I mean it's not obvious to me how you turn open source into a into a business has it been like very difficult or how how's that been um you know we knew we were going to build Lang Smith from the beginning and I think Lang Smith has turned out to be a correct bet like I think there's definitely a market there um and I think the you know but but it is difficult because it's not Lan chain right it's a separate thing like we basically have two teams internally and we basically twice the number of competitors right because there's some competitors for the open source some competitors for link Smith um but luckily we have a very good team that moves very quickly and I think we're able to ship and and and so I think we have the best product in both um but yeah you really I I remember talking with the data bricks people early on um and and they did a similar thing where they had they had spark and then they had their datab break platform um and the way they kind of um framed it was you had to you had to hit a home run in each right so like by the time we started the company you know would gotten a hit with l TBD like you know what's a home run versus what's a single but we got in a hit and yeah with doing that with Lang Smith we had to do that again and I do think we've done it again um you know obviously I I don't know if it's single or home run but like I think think um but yeah you have to do it with both and they're different skills one's Source one's a platform um different set of competitors different set of considerations uh at least one kind of takes the the users to the other one right yeah yeah oh I mean I I would actually say both um both like lane lane chain takes people to Lang Smith but then Lange Smith also makes L chain a better experience so there absolutely is like a flywheel there um and that was intentional as well we didn't want to do something like completely separate um we wanted to do something where there was a strong flywheel um but it is still different skill sets and different product right and if it were only the open source part uh do you have like um like a monetization side of it or is it like completely I mean I really don't know how how to monetize open source so just enlighten me here yeah I mean I think a lot of traditional open source is kind of you know we spent a lot of time looking at kind of like comparables so so like a lot of Open Source databases for example monetize a hosted version of that database um but link chain is not a database and so it would be unclear what that would be but if we were to do that that would probably look like a hosted Lang chain experience maybe like a low codee no code version or something like that um and we didn't want to do that because well we we haven't done that yet because we think it's still really early on really fast moving and that wasn't like the blocker for people we saw the blocker being the problems that Lang Smith solves um so that's why we didn't do it but if you're saying like Okay you can't build Lang Smith then like yeah we probably would invest more in like a hosted experience of sorts um I think another like reasonable analogy is kind of like nextjs and versel um and you know we're starting to build some of that with like langing serve and hosted langing serve so like really easy way to deploy Lang chain applications uh but again we we we see the Lang Smith being a bit more blocker for folks and at this point we just want to create as much value for people um as opposed to try to capture awesome great um all right I wanted to talk to you a little bit about what you see in the future of the industry and in AI in general how would you see the this future of large language model applications um do you think that it will look a little bit similar to how it's being done today with the rag applications or do you do you see something completely new coming on yeah it's a really good question and any any predictions I make are probably going to be wrong um I think like I think we'll see more and more multimodal applications I think we'll see more and more um like complex applications um so like multistep the language models deciding what to do and then taking that action um and and more and more steps um and and I think we'll see that for a variet of the reasons the models will get better people will figure out how to work with them they'll get cheaper and faster um and yeah so so so I think uh the and then multimodal I think we just see so much excitement about that the models aren't currently there um but when they get there I I do think that'll be big um and so those are two pretty kind of like easy bets um one thing that I'm really interested in is the role of kind of like long-term memory in all these applications like like what does that look like and I think I think I think that will be needed for a lot of applications to get uh like personalized experiences for users and so so what exactly does that look like you know open AI added it into chat GPT and they added it a specific way right um uh we have some memory modules in Lane chain that think about it in a slightly different way um how how is it different though yeah so so open AI um they basically use uh they let the llm decide when it wants to remember things um and then a bunch of memory modules in linkchain kind of like do the remembering automatically and I think there are pros and cons to both um but it's it's like it's kind of like you know active memory versus kind of like background memory um and uh yeah they're are pros and cons to each um very interested by memory I think I think I don't think it's like the thing holding applications back now I think people are still trying to figure out how to get simpler applications to work but if we're talking long-term I think that'll be a big part of it memory Yeah Yeah you mentioned as well multimodel um multimodel models uh can you can you develop a little bit on what that means and how that would be uh like important for the industry yeah so multimodal working with different modalities so like speech text image so like right now uh gp4 um has a vision variant where you can pass in images and then get back a response and so I think this is important because there's all you can like you know previously if I wanted to uh try to build an application that would look at an image and decide what to do I would have to like convert like if it's just text I have to like convert it into some description of it's kind of janky right and so now you like pass in an image and you can be like okay based on this like what action should that's how like we're mostly interested in it in terms of like input is image video audio but then it returns like what an action to take because you know Lang change just interested in like the action taking aspect of it right or that that's a lot of what we're interested in um and yeah so I think be able to pass in an image and ask for the next button to press if you're looking at like a computer screen or something like that or pass in a video and ask for a summary of it or something like that is is really powerful do you see a future where you have like for different language models interacting with each other from different applications like for example today most of the Integrations that we have within different applications I mean all of them are made through apis like one application exposes one part of its logic to the other application and then they connect each other do you see a world where these kind of connections happen with natural with with human language even within applications or does that seem like not realistic in the industry no I I think that's pretty realistic yeah I can totally see that I think I think the main reason that's realistic is it's very valuable to create agents or applications that are more narrowly scoped um right so you you might have uh I mean even back to the customer support bot case that we were talking about earlier where you have one person that's responsible for talking about their their previous orders another for the inventory those can be two separate you know llms chatting with each other yeah that's what I was thinking when you were saying that I was like like what if the person is an llm as well yeah exactly so from that point of view 100% I think that that'll that so you would have something like one person asking their language model assistant hey do this for me and the language model assistant will communicate with the language model assistant from another person exactly yeah I mean I don't know if that's coming soon but that would definitely be very crazy for the for the world um about um AI what what do you see in the open source sphere of language models because I mean we have seen some amazing language models in the open source scene um do you think that I mean how's your what's your position about that and has it changed uh recently with the newer models um I think my position is that they're still not used as much and they're still not as good as the closed Source models um but I think a lot of people are really interested in them I think the interest yeah I mean the you know I I think the interest for a few reasons one they can run locally and so your data doesn't leave the premises two they're often um if if you host them right and there's a few good providers like together Ai and fireworks they can be like really fast especially because they're smaller um right so so I think there's a few different considerations which is like okay like are the open source models like how good are they um like are they going to would I like would I rather use just purely based on how good they are like and open source model or or gbd4 or something like that and right now like if I just want it for how good it is I'm going to be using gbd4 and because it's early in the industry um we see that people are just using gbd4 because they're still trying to figure out what to build and if you can't build it with the best model you're not going to be able to build it with a weaker model but I do think it's possible that it'll start to change as these things go to production and then you carry about cost and latency and all of that and so that maybe more appealing to look towards the smaller model um and you know there's a lot of good capable smaller models out there that you could fine-tune if if if you wanted to if you have this really high production um and so I think that's really interesting to think about and and that's an area we're very interested in exploring well I wanted to ask you a little bit as well about I mean real quick about the security side side of it because I mean what Lang chain is doing I mean at some degree is fac facilitating the creation of autonomous agents and just that word autonomous agent uh might freak out a lot of people um do what what is your your position or your thoughts about this security issues with programs that can reason and act in the real world yeah it it's a good question uh I I have a few thoughts I mean one like I don't think the current systems are that good right now like I think they're still very narrow focused right and so you know they can and they can be very good at there was narrow focused but I don't think it's like it don't think it's it there like I don't think there at a position where they're gonna run off and cause a lot of harm um I do think though that you absolutely need to be careful when you hook up various things to a language model mod and so there are a lot of things in linkchain like we have a we have a python reppel where you can run python code but if you're running L generated python code that could be unsafe and so we have a lot of warnings like hey this is experimental you probably like want to be careful about this um and so yeah I'd say those are my two main thoughts like yes you I think I think we're we're mostly like encouraging people to be really thoughtful about the types of thing like I think I I I think there's like two separate things when you talk about safety there's like okay the models are getting better and better and so like will they allow people to you know will will will will anyone be able to like learn how to like build a bomb or something right like that would be terrible right and so I think there's a lot of like safety work going into like that um and and that's a little separate from linkchain and so I view that as separate then there's like okay like are people putting these things as a reasoning the engine and creating these systems that could be dangerous and I think that really boils down to like are people giving it like um like what types of tools are people giving it access to then and and they letting it operate and so yeah we you know I I think we try to put a lot of warning around dangerous Tools in L chain and and try to bring attention on that note would you support a more strict regulations of this kind of um uh companies that deal with language models given that probably in the future most companies will be Dev I mean most software companies will be developing their own llm applications at this point no I'm generally not really in favor of Regulation um I Al to be honest I also don't spend a ton of time thinking about it um I For Better or Worse that's right yeah because I mean the what one of the things that shocked me uh the most about Sam Sam Alman when he was in his interview with I think it was with Lex fredman that he I mean he has always been openly open about his position that regulation is required and that's why he's doing this and he wants to be regulated and things like that so that's that's kind of that was kind of a new thing for me especially in in in the software industry and Industry in general right but yeah so I think they're not many people uh leading companies uh thinking like that I suppose yeah I I think uh you know he also probably has a much more nuanced and and detailed view on this than than I do and so I'm I'm I'm I don't think I'm incredibly qualified to speak on let's just take care of our applications and try to be responsible with how we use them right all right um do you have um I mean we're coming to the end of the of the conversation do you have like some other new projects that you would like to share or some other new advances in AI that you're excited about that you see coming in the future something I don't know yeah I mean I mean very short term um a few few of the things that we're working on um one on the open source we're putting a lot of effort into like query analysis like I think the query analysis bit can be really helpful when improving rag applications I think it takes advantage of a lot of things that Lang chain is good at like structured outputs and things like that um and so we'll be putting out a lot of content around retrieval but specifically around query analysis um and then on L Smith we we're doing a big push on kind of like online evaluation and like automatic kind of like f shot example data set curation and stuff like that um and uh so that should we should hopefully have some stuff to share there in a month or so um but but those are kind of like the two very short-term things that we're thinking about right that's about Lang chain in particular and in the world in general do you have like some like some new developments that you are like yeah I hope this comes soon uh we'll hopefully be able to use it in Lang chain or something like that yeah I mean all the model advancements are super exciting like Gemini 1.5 with their million context window length is really exciting Straw's new model that they just released um you know I'm sure others will putting out new models as well and so I think uh I think yeah just very excited for better models which seems to be happening yeah about that actually I forgot to ask you about that um about the huge context windows that these models are starting to have do you think that that's going to uh make obsoletes some of the rag applications or how do you see that happening some of them probably yeah yeah um I think it will become less and less important how you chunk things and split things up for example um I think the parts of rag we we spent a lot of time thinking about rag I think there's three main components of rag that I don't think are going anywhere in some form um so one's indexing so this is just like taking documents and putting them into some sort of data structure some sort of index um and I think long condex will probably change what those data structures are right you may not need like as many small chunks you may not need to be as clever about it but you still need to fetch doents from somewhere whether it be like elastic search traditional elastic search or something like that so I think there's an indexing step then there's a query analysis stuff so like figuring out what documents to fetch still think that's going to be needed um I think like when you deal with large col well so so there is a difference between if you're doing rag over like a single document or rag over a large collection of documents and so rag over a single document like yeah most of the stuff will go away rag over lots of documents all this stuff will stay around and so the quer and the stuff I think is is really important there and then there's a reranking step and I think that'll be important but yeah rag over single document you're just going to pass the document into the C response yeah yeah I can see that happening too all right okay well uh I don't know if you have any extra comments that you would like to make some extra message that you would like to pass to the community or some or something you would like to say check out all Andre's YouTube he does awesome stuff uh and yeah more people should be like all hund and building awesome things and teaching people how to thank you man I appreciate it um yeah well thank you thank you very much Harrison for for being here for coming to talk with me and it's been an amazing time having this

Based on the eponymous fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous animated films and specials. It stars Margot Robbie as the title character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, and follows them on a journey of self-discovery through both Barbieland and the real world following an existential crisis. It is also a commentary regarding patriarchy and the effects of feminism. The supporting cast includes America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell. A live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast was announced in early 2022. Principal photography occurred primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, England, and at the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022. Barbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 21. Its concurrent release with Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer was the catalyst of the \\"Barbenheimer\\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film grossed 1.446 billion and achieved several milestones, including the highest-grossing film of 2023 and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time. Named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, it received critical acclaim and other accolades, including eight Academy Award nominations (among them Best Picture), winning Best Original Song for \\"What Was I Made For?\\"; the song also won Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song while Barbie was awarded Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. Plot Barbie (\\"Stereotypical Barbie\\") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in law, science, politics, and so on. Ken (\\"Beach Ken\\") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and seeks a closer relationship with her, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships. One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines and the classic perfection of the Barbies. Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, tells Barbie to find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Barbie decides to follow the advice and travel to the real world, with Ken joining Barbie by stowing away in her convertible. After arriving in Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man after he gropes her. Barbie and Ken are briefly arrested. Alarmed by the dolls' presence in the real world, the CEO of Mattel orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a teenage girl named Sasha, who criticizes Barbie for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently caused Barbie's existential crisis after Gloria began playing with Sasha's old Barbies. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help, and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit. Meanwhile, Ken learns about patriarchy and feels respected for the first time. He returns to Barbieland before Barbie does and persuades the other Kens to take over. The Kens indoctrinate the Barbies into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and attempts to convince the Barbies to be independent again. When her attempts fail, she becomes depressed. Gloria expresses her frustration with the conflicting standards women are forced to follow in the real world. Gloria's speech restores Barbie's confidence. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria uses her knowledge from the real world to deprogram the Barbies from their indoctrination. The Barbies then manipulate the Kens into fighting among themselves, which distracts them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, allowing the Barbies to regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts. Barbie and Ken apologize to each other, acknowledging their past mistakes. When Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots. After sharing goodbyes with the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives, Barbie decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \\"Barbara Handler\\", to her first gynecologist appointment. \\"","completion":"In the 2023 live-action film *Barbie*, directed by Greta Gerwig, the title character and her supporting cast navigate an intriguing blend of comedic and philosophical themes, centered around self-discovery, gender roles, and the complexities of societal expectations. Each character brings a distinct perspective to the narrative, contributing to the film's multifaceted exploration of identity, autonomy, and societal change. Below is an analysis of the main characters in the film: # Barbie (Margot Robbie) Barbie represents the quintessential symbol of beauty and perfection as seen through the lens of societal expectations. However, her journey is one of existential crisis and self-discovery. Struggling with concerns about mortality and imperfection, she embarks on a quest that challenges her preconceived notions of identity. Her character arc is a commentary on the pressures women face to adhere to unrealistic beauty standards and societal roles. Barbie's evolution from a doll living in a matriarchal utopia to a self-aware individual confronting the real world's complexities symbolizes the journey towards self-acceptance and the search for authentic identity beyond societal expectations. # Ken (Ryan Gosling) Ken serves as a critical commentary on traditional masculine roles and the concept of patriarchy. Initially depicted as living a carefree life and seeking validation through his relationship with Barbie, Ken's journey into the real world and his subsequent experiences in Barbieland without Barbie lead to an awakening about his own identity and purpose. His character challenges the stereotype of men finding their worth solely in their relationships or societal status, ultimately seeking an autonomous identity. # Gloria Gloria represents the generational influence on perceptions of beauty and identity. Her interaction with Barbie dolls triggers the crisis that propels the narrative, symbolizing the impact of societal and parental influence on young girls' self-image. Her journey with Barbie and Sasha in addressing the consequences of these influences highlights the importance of conscious engagement with the media and toys that shape childhood and societal norms. # Sasha As Barbie's real-world owner, Sasha embodies the modern young woman's perspective on the Barbie doll and what it represents in terms of beauty standards and female identity. Her criticism of Barbie for promoting unrealistic expectations reflects the broader societal critique of the doll and similar cultural icons. Sasha's involvement in resolving the conflict in Barbieland signifies the power of the younger generation to challenge and change prevailing narratives about gender and identity. # Weird Barbie Weird Barbie represents those who do not fit into societal norms or traditional categories of beauty and success. Treated as an outcast, her character highlights issues of inclusivity and acceptance. Her role in guiding Barbie signifies the value of diverse perspectives and the strength found in embracing one's uniqueness against societal pressure to conform. # The Narrative's Commentary *Barbie* delves into issues of femininity, authenticity, and societal expectation with a nuanced blend of humor and gravity. By confronting the stereotypes and roles imposed on individuals based on gender, the film advocates for a more inclusive and understanding society where people can explore their identities freely and without judgment. Through its characters' journeys, the film invites viewers to reflect on the constructs of beauty, success, and purpose in their own lives, encouraging a move towards self-awareness and acceptance."},{"prompt":"I, along with so many others, went to see “Barbie” on opening night. The theater was filled with women of all ages, covered in pink, feeling connected and seen by what was playing on the big screen. There was so much excitement around a movie that focused on women and embraced many pieces of girls’ childhoods. The movie was a smash hit too, breaking records as the biggest box office opening in 2023 and the highest grossing film directed by a woman. Women saw themselves represented in so many ways on screen and saw their frustrations with the patriarchy being voiced through film. Then, the real world started talking. If you haven’t watched “Barbie” yet, there are plot spoilers incoming. In Barbie Land, the patriarchy does not exist, the Kens do not take up much of the Barbies’ thoughts. The Barbies believe that because they can do anything, women in the real world can do anything. This changes when Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, starts to have feelings of anxiety and imperfection. On a quest to eliminate these bad feelings and go back to the life she had, she goes to the Real World, with Ken following her. At first, Barbie looks for women in positions of power, but she is met with sexual harassment and assault by the men she finds instead. Ken learns about the patriarchy and speaks with Real World men in power. While Barbie runs from the Mattel Company CEO, Ken brings his fascination with the patriarchy to Barbie Land. He destroys everything the Barbies have built in Barbie Land and brainwashes the Barbies, turning them into servants. When all feels lost for Barbie and she feels like she is worthless, it’s a woman from the Real World, Gloria, played by America Ferrera, who reminds her of who she is in a harrowing speech about what it is like to be a woman. The movie also takes time to address Ken and his struggles. After Barbie Land is restored, Barbie shows him that he can be his own person outside of being Barbie’s boyfriend. She encourages Ken to figure out who he is on his own, telling him that “maybe it’s Barbie and it’s Ken.” By this, she means that Ken should explore his life, not as Barbie’s accessory, but as his own person with his own ambitions. This plays into a role reversal in which oftentimes women are seen as the accessory to men in relationships, especially in movies. This movie exists in direct opposition to everything the patriarchy teaches men. By showing a reversed version of real-life oppressive gender roles, it is a valuable lesson for men to improve how they treat women and themselves. Its themes and messaging stand as a testament to women everywhere who cannot express the depth of how impossible it is to be a woman. There were many moments in “Barbie” that spoke to the dissatisfaction women feel in the real world. Women were enjoying their stories being told by other women — then anti-men criticism entered. There is currently unwarranted backlash from men towards “Barbie,” calling the movie anti-men and man-hating. These critics claim that the movie portrays men as weak and un-masculine. Additionally, they find the themes of anti-patriarchy to be “woke,” with conservative personality Ben Shapiro commenting that the film’s theme is “either you’re a third wave feminist who hates men, truly hates men, or you’re brainwashed.” summarise this","completion":"The 2023 live-action \\"Barbie\\" movie, directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie as the titular character, received widespread acclaim, especially among women, for its exploration of issues related to femininity, the patriarchy, and societal expectations. The film, which broke box office records as the highest-grossing film directed by a woman and the biggest opening of the year, resonated with audiences by delving into the complexities of women's experiences and the challenges they face in a patriarchal society. \\"Barbie\\" takes place in both \\"Barbieland,\\" where there is no patriarchy and Barbie lives a seemingly perfect life, and the \\"real world,\\" which Barbie visits after experiencing feelings of anxiety and imperfection. The contrast between these worlds highlights issues of gender inequality, power dynamics, and identity. Ken, played by Ryan Gosling, learns about patriarchy in the real world and disturbingly imposes these lessons upon returning to Barbieland, leading to a societal reversal that mirrors real-world oppressive gender roles. The film tackles tough themes such as sexual harassment, the pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards, and the struggle for women to find their place in a male-dominated society. It also addresses male identity, encouraging Ken—and by extension, men in the audience—to seek autonomy and define himself beyond his relationship with Barbie, challenging traditional relationship dynamics and gender roles. Despite its positive reception and empowering messages, the film faced criticism from some corners, with accusations of being anti-men and promoting a man-hating agenda, particularly from conservative commentators who decried its anti-patriarchal themes as \\"woke.\\" This backlash overlooks the film's broader commentary on gender equality and the importance of understanding and dismantling oppressive systems for the benefit of all genders."},{"prompt":"can you summarise ken's character","completion":"Ken, as portrayed by Ryan Gosling in the 2023 live-action \\"Barbie\\" film, initially embodies the archetypal male companion to Barbie, living a carefree and superficial existence in Barbieland, where his biggest concern is his relationship with Barbie. He enjoys life at the beach, which he considers his profession, indicating a lack of depth in his character's early presentation. However, Ken undergoes significant character development through the film. His journey begins in earnest when he follows Barbie to the real world, a place far removed from the idyllic Barbieland, and here he encounters the concept of patriarchy for the first time. Ken's discovery of patriarchal systems leads him to reassess his significance beyond being merely \\"Barbie's boyfriend,\\" sparking an existential quest for meaning and identity. This quest turns problematic when he returns to Barbieland with a misguided interpretation of the patriarchal dynamics he learned in the real world, leading him to establish a reversed oppressive order. This act not only reflects Ken's struggle with his introduction to real-world complexities but also ironically highlights the challenges of interpreting and reacting to societal structures. Ultimately, Ken's character arc conveys a message about self-discovery and the importance of forming an identity independent of societal expectations and relationship dynamics. Through his interactions with Barbie and the transformative experiences in both the real world and Barbieland, Ken learns to view himself as an individual, not just an accessory to Barbie. This growth signifies the film's broader thematic exploration of gender roles, identity, and the impacts of societal norms on personal development."},{"prompt":"Here are the main problems I face, that I've written down after thorough analysis of my past behaviour, that explain why I'm constantly in stagnation and misery. Many of those problems are heavily related to ADHD, meaning I've been struggling with them all my life, but only now have I been able to completely identify them: - I'm so deeply afraid of failure, that in every facet of life I run away from possible gradation, vulnerability and so on. Due to that, I don't know how to progress with my relationships, how to learn incrementally, how to apprecaite time-consuming tasks. - I don't want to bother people with my agenda and wants, so in the end all my relations are superficial and feel forced in the end. I don't even make an attempt to improve the situation; instead I indulge in further self-imposed isolation and externalizing by sadness, via my actions or body langauge. The pattern of reccuring problems seems to be synonymous with my problems with creative activities, too. - I dislike commitment. I seek shortcuts, I don't maintain productive habits, I optimize my way around things maladaptively. I prefer living the illusion, doing something once and then being content with my current achievements or lack thereof. I engage in thinking what I've already done is enough, becuase I'm afraid of a failure ending my string of successes, and hence lead to discomfort. - I'm always disappointed by my own work, it always seem slike there is something fundamental missing there. Almost as if it's nevery truly viable for production and on on-par with standards. - I always feel like what I'm doing is wrong, too arbitrary, and that I won't know how to implement my ideas properly. - I'm afraid of starting out with wrong solutions, and that I won't know how to fix my mistakes in the long term. - I never feel like working, because I lack a concrete plan of action and I constanly hit complex roadblocks. - I'm trying to do too many things at the same, because I'm actually quite behind with many skills, so much so, that I'm worried I won't be able to ever catch up, and I want to do so many things! - I'm impatient and struggle with reconciling delayed gratification coming from demanding tasks. - I'm never sure how to take things further, how to practice consistency, how to improve. - I don't do anything, because I know I'll struggle at the beginning and won't know how to fix my mistakes. The boilerplate always seems arbitrary and that frustrates me, as I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. Furthermore, every task requires a vast amount of knowledge and skills to execute, and I struggle with aquiring all that, so when will I finally be prepared? When will I stop hitting roadblocks and actually work on something? - When I finally attempt something, it always ends up lacking, as I don't know how to get over the many steps that I'm not prepared for. But how am I supposed to get preared for those circumstances beforehand?","completion":"Your self-reflection is an important first step towards overcoming the challenges you've identified. Many of the issues you're grappling with are indeed common among individuals with ADHD, but they can also be experienced by people without the condition. No matter the cause, the frustration and stagnation you're feeling are real and valid. Here are some strategies to help you tackle these difficulties: # On Fear of Failure and Perfectionism 1. **Embrace a Growth Mindset**: Understand that failure is not a reflection of your worth but a vital part of learning and growth. Start small, celebrate your efforts and progress, not just the results. 2. **Progress Over Perfection**: Shift your focus from achieving a flawless outcome to making progress. Allow yourself to make mistakes—it's how you learn and improve. # On Relationships and Isolation 1. **Open Communication**: Try expressing your needs and desires more openly to those close to you. Most people are more accommodating and understanding than you might expect. 2. **Seek Support**: Consider joining support groups for ADHD or counseling, where you can learn strategies for building and maintaining relationships despite your fears. # On Disliking Commitment and Seeking Shortcuts 1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Celebrate achieving these smaller goals to maintain motivation. 2. **Develop a Routine**: Utilize tools designed for ADHD, like planners or apps, to help you establish and stick to a productive routine. # On Being Hard on Yourself 1. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Acknowledge your efforts and progress, however small. Remind yourself that you're doing your best under challenging circumstances. 2. **Seek Feedback**: Share your work with others you trust to get constructive feedback. This can help you see your work from a different perspective and identify areas for improvement without being overly critical of yourself. # On Feeling Overwhelmed and Impatient 1. **Prioritize and Focus**: With so many interests and tasks, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Try to prioritize your tasks based on urgency and importance. Focus on one thing at a time. 2. **Mindfulness and Patience**: Practices like mindfulness can help cultivate patience and reduce impulsivity. Try mindfulness exercises or meditation to foster a more patient and focused mindset. # On Not Knowing How to Proceed 1. **Learning and Adaptability**: View every task as a learning opportunity. If you don't know something, take it as a chance to learn. There are countless resources available online for almost every skill or knowledge area. 2. **Accept that Learning is Non-linear**: Progress often involves taking two steps forward and one step back. Accepting the non-linear nature of learning can help you feel less frustrated by the process. # On Getting Started and Fear of Inadequacy 1. **Just Start**: Sometimes, the hardest part is starting. Break the task down into the smallest possible step and do just that one thing. 2. **Adopt a Problem-Solving Mindset**: When facing a problem, try to shift your mindset from feeling overwhelmed to considering it a challenge to overcome. Additional Considerations - **Professional Guidance**: Consider seeking help from a professional who specializes in ADHD. They can offer tailored strategies and therapies that can help you manage your specific challenges. - **Medication**: For some, medication can be a cornerstone in managing ADHD symptoms effectively. Discuss with your healthcare provider to see if this is a suitable option for you. Remember, overcoming these challenges is a journey, not a sprint. Small, consistent changes in how you approach tasks and setbacks can lead to significant improvements over time."},{"prompt":"Quiero que me digas como está conformado el atiendo escolar de illyasviel von einzbern (fate/kaleid) en específico su blusa y el cuello de la misma","completion":"Illyasviel von Einzbern, comúnmente conocida como Illya en \\"Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya\\", es una de las protagonistas de esta serie derivada del universo de Fate. Este anime/manga presenta una versión alternativa de Illya, diferente a la que se puede ver en \\"Fate/stay night\\" y sus respectivas secuelas. En \\"Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya\\", Illya asiste a la escuela como una niña normal, lo cual es una gran desviación de su papel en \\"Fate/stay night\\". El atuendo escolar que usa Illya en \\"Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya\\" es bastante característico y se compone principalmente de una blusa y un cuello específico: 1. **Blusa**: Illya usa una blusa escolar de color blanco como parte de su uniforme escolar. La blusa típicamente tiene mangas largas y es bastante estándar en cuanto al diseño de uniformes escolares japoneses. 2. **Cuello**: Lo característico del uniforme, y que a menudo destaca, es el cuello estilo marinero. Este cuello es un elemento distintivo de muchos uniformes escolares en Japón. En el caso de Illya, el cuello es de un color azul oscuro, bordeado por una franja blanca que le da un contraste llamativo. En el centro del cuello, justo en la parte delantera, a menudo lleva un lazo o corbata que puede variar en color, pero comúnmente se ve en tonos de rojo o burdeos, lo que agrega un toque de color al conjunto. Este estilo de uniforme es bastante representativo de los uniformes escolares femeninos en Japón, aunque cada escuela puede tener variaciones en el diseño y color.

La blusa de su uniforme escolar es blanca con mangas cortas. Lo particular de su diseño es que el cuello es abierto con solapas, lo cual es un tanto inusual para los estándares de los uniformes escolares japoneses comunes, brindando una apariencia ligeramente más casual o de moda. Este cuello abierto y las solapas revelan sutilmente los hombros, agregando un toque de diseño único al uniforme. Además, las solapas y el extremo de las mangas están decoradas con franjas rojas, lo que agrega un contraste de color vibrante contra el blanco principal de la blusa. Este detalle en rojo en la blusa proporciona un aspecto visual llamativo y distintivo al uniforme de Illya. Otro detalle notable en la blusa son los ornamentos en forma de cruz que se encuentran en las mangas. Estos ornamentos no solo complementan el diseño general de la blusa, sino que también aportan un elemento visual distintivo que destaca en el contexto de su atuendo escolar.

Vamos a precisar más sobre el uniforme escolar de Illyasviel von Einzbern (Illya) en \\"Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya\\", centrándonos en el detalle específico del cuello de su blusa. En el diseño del uniforme de Illya, la blusa blanca presenta un cuello abierto, que es ciertamente una característica única y que distingue su uniforme escolar de muchos otros diseños de uniformes japoneses. La peculiaridad reside en que, a pesar de que el cuello está abierto, en el centro de este diseño abierto, justo debajo del punto donde termina el cuello abierto, se ubica un detalle que puede parecer parte de la blusa o un accesorio adicional. Este detalle es generalmente un botón o adorno que se encuentra justo en el centro, a menudo conectado a un lazo estrecho o una tira de tela que queda colgando verticalmente desde el punto central del cuello. Este elemento añade tanto a la estética como a la funcionalidad del uniforme, aportando un punto focal y un toque de decoración sin sobrecargar el diseño general de la blusa. En algunos casos, este detalle podría interpretarse como una continuación del diseño de la blusa, diseñado para realzar el corte abierto del cuello y proporcionar un punto de interés visual que es tanto discreto como elegante.

Hay correlación entre cosas que no tienen nada que ver entre sí? Dar un ejemplo","completion":"Una correlación es una relación estadística entre dos variables, en la que cambios en una variable se asocian con cambios en la otra. Las correlaciones pueden ser positivas (donde si una variable aumenta, la otra también tiende a aumentar) o negativas (donde si una variable aumenta, la otra tiende a disminuir). Es importante destacar que la correlación no implica causalidad; es decir, aunque dos variables estén correlacionadas, esto no significa necesariamente que una cause cambios en la otra. Es muy posible, y común, encontrar correlaciones entre cosas que, intuitivamente, no parecen tener nada que ver entre sí. Esto puede deberse a varias razones, incluyendo la presencia de variables confusas (variables no consideradas que afectan a las observaciones) o simplemente a coincidencias en los datos recopilados. Ejemplos de tales correlaciones espurias (correlaciones observadas que no reflejan una relación causal real) son abundantes y a menudo se citan como ejemplos humorísticos para ilustrar la diferencia entre correlación y causalidad. **Ejemplo**: Un ejemplo famoso de correlación espuria es la relación entre el consumo de queso per cápita y el número de personas que mueren enredadas en sus sábanas cada año en Estados Unidos. Estadísticamente, estas dos variables muestran una correlación sorprendentemente alta durante ciertos períodos, a pesar de que no hay una razón lógica o mecánica por la cual el consumo de queso debería causar este tipo de accidentes, o viceversa. Este ejemplo destaca cómo correlaciones inesperadas pueden emerger de los datos por pura coincidencia o por factores subyacentes no relacionados directamente con las variables en cuestión."},{"prompt":"hay casos en donde no hay correlación estadística pero sí causalidad?","completion":"Sí, existen situaciones donde puede haber causalidad sin correlación estadística evidente, aunque estos casos pueden ser menos intuitivos de identificar. Las razones de esta aparente discrepancia incluyen la existencia de relaciones no lineales, la presencia de múltiples variables influyentes, la existencia de umbrales de efecto y la variabilidad en la medición de las variables. Veamos algunos escenarios donde esto puede ocurrir: 1. **Relaciones no lineales**: Si la relación entre las variables no es lineal, como en el caso de relaciones cuadráticas, exponenciales, o sinusoidales, la correlación lineal (la más comúnmente medida) puede ser baja o incluso cercana a cero. Esto no significa que una variable no afecte a la otra, sino que la forma en que la afectan no es constantemente en una única dirección (positiva o negativa) a lo largo de todo el rango de las variables. 2. **Compensación entre efectos**: Podría existir una situación en la cual una variable cause diferentes efectos en otra variable bajo distintas condiciones, de tal manera que estos efectos se compensen entre sí cuando se observan en un conjunto de datos amplio. Esto podría hacer que parezca que no hay correlación cuando, de hecho, hay relaciones causales subyacentes específicas al contexto. 3. **Presencia de variables confusas**: A veces, la relación causal directa entre dos variables puede ser ocultada por el efecto de una tercera variable (o más variables) que no se ha medido o incluido en el análisis. Esto puede distorsionar la aparente correlación estadística entre dos variables que realmente tienen una relación causal. 4. **Umbrales de efecto**: En algunos casos, un efecto causal solo se manifiesta cuando una variable excede cierto umbral. En estos casos, si la mayoría de las observaciones no cruza ese umbral, la correlación estadística general entre las variables puede parecer débil o inexistente, a pesar de que hay una relación causal fuerte para valores específicos de las variables. 5. **Variabilidad alta y tamaño de muestra**: Si las variables involucradas tienen una alta variabilidad intrínseca o el tamaño de la muestra es pequeño, puede ser difícil detectar una correlación estadística incluso si existe una relación causal real. Esto puede deberse a la insuficiencia de datos para capturar adecuadamente la relación o a que el \\"ruido\\" en los datos sobrepasa la \\"señal\\" de la correlación. Estos ejemplos subrayan la importancia de un análisis cuidadoso y una interpretación prudente al explorar relaciones entre variables. La ausencia de correlación estadística no descarta necesariamente la posibilidad de una relación causal, y el análisis de causalidad a menudo requiere enfoques metodológicos específicos diseñados para identificar y confirmar la existencia de tales relaciones."},{"prompt":"Cómo sería una correlación sin contexto donde nos sea de utilidad \\"usarlo\\" mas que \\"no usarlo\\"?","completion":"Una correlación sin contexto puede seguir siendo útil en varios escenarios, especialmente en las etapas iniciales de investigación o cuando el objetivo es la exploración de datos o la generación de hipótesis. Sin embargo, para ser de utilidad práctica, el uso de estas correlaciones debe ir acompañado de una comprensión de sus limitaciones y de la necesidad de investigaciones adicionales para establecer cualquier relación causal subyacente. Vamos a explorar algunas situaciones en que una correlación sin contexto podría ser \\"útil\\", más allá de su valor inicial superficial: 1. **Generación de hipótesis**: Una correlación inesperada o sin contexto inmediato puede ser el punto de inicio para generar nuevas hipótesis. Investigadores y científicos pueden explorar estas correlaciones y desarrollar teorías sobre posibles relaciones causales, lo que podría llevar a avances significativos en comprensión y conocimiento. 2. **Identificación de patrones ocultos**: En grandes conjuntos de datos (big data), las correlaciones detectadas mediante técnicas de minería de datos pueden revelar patrones ocultos que no eran evidentes anteriormente. Aunque el contexto de estas correlaciones puede no estar claro en el momento del descubrimiento, pueden señalar áreas para investigaciones más focalizadas y contextualizadas. 3. **Prevención y detección temprana**: En el ámbito de la salud pública o la seguridad, incluso las correlaciones sin un contexto claro pueden ser útiles para la prevención o detección temprana de enfermedades o incidentes. Por ejemplo, si una correlación revela una asociación entre ciertas condiciones ambientales y tasas de enfermedad, las autoridades pueden tomar medidas precautorias mientras se investigan las causas subyacentes. 4. **Machine learning y modelos predictivos**: En el desarrollo de modelos de machine learning, las correlaciones pueden usarse para mejorar la precisión de las predicciones, incluso si el mecanismo causal no es comprendido completamente. Estos modelos se entrenan sobre una gran cantidad de datos para identificar relaciones y hacer predicciones, y pueden ser extremadamente útiles en campos como la meteorología, el comercio financiero o la recomendación de productos. 5. **Innovación en productos y servicios**: Las empresas a menudo utilizan correlaciones para identificar patrones de consumo y preferencias de los clientes. Aunque una correlación por sí sola no explique el porqué detrás de un comportamiento de compra, puede servir para ajustar estrategias de marketing o para el desarrollo de nuevos productos que apunten a tendencias identificadas. En todos estos casos, la utilidad de la correlación sin contexto reside en su capacidad para señalar hacia algo que podría no haber sido considerado anteriormente, actuando como un catalizador para una exploración más profunda. Sin embargo, es crucial abordar estos hallazgos con un espíritu crítico y una mente abierta a la posibilidad de que más investigaciones puedan revelar una falta de relación causal o factores subyacentes no evidentes inicialmente."},{"prompt":"Write an amendment for the following contract, as stated in clause 4.1, extending its duration for addition 12 months and keeping all other clauses unchanged.

It also affirms that all other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain unchanged and in full force. # Suggestions for Improvement: 1. **Clarify the Effective Date of the Amendment:** Though the amendment specifies it is \\"entered into as of March 31st, 2024,\\" it would be clearer to specify whether the amendment takes effect upon signing or retroactively applies from March 31st, 2024. Clarifying the effective date of the amendment ensures both parties are clear on the period of extension and when the new terms come into effect. 2. **Specify the Original Agreement Date:** Adding the date of the original agreement can provide better context and clarity. This helps in quickly identifying the document being amended, especially if the parties have entered into multiple agreements in the past. 3. **Include a Definitions Section if Necessary:** If the amendment or the original agreement contains specialized terms not understood by a general audience, including a definitions section could improve clarity. For this document, terms seem straightforward, but this suggestion might be applicable in other contexts or more complex amendments. 4. **Signature Blocks:** Ensure that the signature blocks are correctly formatted and indicate the name and title of the signees, offering clear evidence of the parties' agreement to the terms of the amendment. 5. **Witness Signatures:** The document mentions the presence of witnesses during signing, which implies the signing process will be witnessed as per the concluding statement. It's crucial to make sure this is a requirement under the governing law of the contract. If witnesses do sign, their names, addresses, and signatures should be formally included. 6. **Clarification of Binding Terms:** It mentions that the parties “agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.” It could be beneficial to include an acknowledgment that the parties had the opportunity to consult with legal representatives before agreeing, ensuring the agreement was made with full understanding and without pressure. 7. **Review Legal References:** Ensure that all references to the corporation’s registrations, and any clause references (such as Clause 4.1 and 5.6 from the original agreement), are accurate and correctly cited. 8. **Language and Grammar Check:** Though the document seems grammatically sound, a final proofread to catch any typographical errors or unclear sentences is always recommended before finalizing a legal document. By addressing these suggestions, the document can be improved for clarity, professionalism, and legal robustness, ensuring that both parties are fully aware of their obligations and the terms to which they are agreeing."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the document to include the suggestions (1) and (2).

However, I can describe how such an artwork might be composed and how it might feel, drawing on the illustrious art history of Japan and the specific elements you've mentioned. Picture this: The canvas stretches in a panorama, dimensions carefully chosen to emulate a feeling of vastness, a 71:128 aspect ratio making each detail elongate, inviting the eye to wander and explore. At the heart of this setting is the shadowy yet detailed form of a samurai, the protagonist of this visual narrative, positioned not just as a figure in this landscape, but as an integral part of it, a narrative made visible through intricate brushwork. His armor, although rendered in the monochromatic palette typical of Japanese ink drawings, is detailed meticulously, each plate and rivet catching the fading light, suggesting the clangor of battles past and the silent dignity of the warrior's path. There's a fluidity in the lines that compose his form, suggesting movement and a poised energy, as if he's captured in a moment of potent stillness before action. The backdrop is a masterclass in the use of negative space and delicate gradients, attributes celebrated in traditional Japanese ink drawings. The setting sun, a disk perhaps less defined, bleaches the sky in a gradient of ink-washed grays flirting with the edges of blacks and whites, suggesting the close of day. The sun's light bleaches the colors of the sky and landscape, infusing the scene with a temporal quality, a reminder of the impermanence echoed in the samurai's creed. Trees, their forms simplified yet elegant, frame the samurai, their branches bending as if in homage or perhaps in shared resilience, their leaves inked with such delicacy that they seem to rustle in the implied breeze. The intricate brushwork suggests vitality amidst the serenity of the scene, a balance between action and contemplation that defines the life of a samurai. The shadows cast are long and deep, stretching away from the setting sun, filled with suggestion and nuance, hinting at the presence of unseen spirits or perhaps the weight of the legends that the samurai carries with him. These shadows, paired with the brilliantly highlighted edges of his figure and the landscape, create a visual tension, a play between light and dark that captures the essence of the samurai's story — one of glory, honor, and the inevitable decline that comes with the fall of day. In the far distance, the faintest silhouette of a castle or a temple hints at the existence of a world beyond the immediate serenity, a tie to the civilization for which the samurai stands guard. It’s a reminder of the societal order and culture from which the samurai’s legend stems and to which his story will return, in tales told beneath the glow of lanterns in the nights to come. This proposed artwork, thus, becomes not just a visual representation but a poetic homage to the samurai's place within both the natural world and the constructed societal landscape, invoking a narrative rich with cultural heritage and emotional depth, all through the medium of Japanese ink drawing."},{"prompt":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun --ar 71:128, realistic, generate a title that is only 100 characters long, do not include the flags starting with '--' and its value, metions on resolutions","completion":"\\"Sunset Blades: A Samurai's Silhouette Against the Fading Light\\""},{"prompt":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun --ar 71:128, realistic, generate a description that is personable and describe the realistic art work on a canvas, include where in home it can be hung and gift for people, decor style or house theme, do not include the flags starting with '--' and its value, metions on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' for formatting only newline ' '","completion":"Imagine a Japanese ink drawing that captures the essence of samurai legends.

Однако следует сразу отметить, что тема чувствительна и может затрагивать различные аспекты культуры, этнические традиции и религиозные взгляды, поэтому обсуждение должно быть предельно корректным и уважительным. 1. **Изменение в традициях и обычаях**: В такой реальности общества могли бы развить определённые традиции, связанные с периодами течки, аналогично тем, как существуют традиции, связанные с переходными ритуалами в разных культурах. Могли бы стать значительно важнее практики, связанные с частной жизнью, интимностью и репродуктивным здоровьем. 2. **Изменение в социальной структуре**: Общество, скорее всего, развило бы различные социальные структуры и нормы, чтобы адаптироваться к таким биологическим изменениям. Это могло бы включать регулирование труда, образования и даже взаимоотношений между полами в социальных, профессиональных и личных сферах. 3. **Здравоохранение и образование**: Системы здравоохранения и образовательные программы, вероятно, адаптировались бы, чтобы предоставлять более специализированные услуги и информацию для поддержки женщин во время течки. Это могло бы включать специальные медицинские центры, центры поддержки, а также образовательные программы по репродуктивному здоровью. 4. **Профессиональная жизнь**: В профессиональных сферах могли бы быть предприняты определённые адаптации для женщин в период течки, например, возможность гибкого графика или работы из дома. Также общество могло бы развивать определённые нормы и политики для поддержания равных возможностей и недискриминации. 5. **Изменение в персональных и семейных отношениях**: Понимание и подход к отношениям могли бы измениться, включая аспекты партнёрства, планирования семьи и воспитания детей. Этот аспект также мог бы повлиять на социальную динамику в семьях и межличностные отношения в общем. 6. **Психологические и эмоциональные аспекты**: Понимание психологических и эмоциональных аспектов, связанных с течкой, стало бы важным элементом социальной жизни. Это могло бы включать развитие подходов к поддержке женщин с целью снижения стресса, анксиозности или других потенциальных психологических эффектов. Описывая такой гипотетический сценарий, важно подчеркнуть, что любое изменение в биологии человека приводит к комплексным изменениям в обществе, которые могут быть непредсказуемы и разнообразны в зависимости от культурных, социальных и экономических факторов."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening with a funny villain moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, Velma tries to sound smart but is really an overly-simple over excited Captain Obvious with stuff like “This door opens” and etc…Scrappy is overly-heroic and thinks he's a superhero and appears alot,, Shaggy, ALWAYS confused, mocks EVERY SINGLE name of people AND THE VILLAINS NAMES with Scooby also mocking them, Fred will always mistake a character for a famous person because of their surname being literally the same as a real life celebrity, forcing the character to correct them angrily, Fred would also put the blame for a monster’s crime on Red Herring (From A Pup Named Scooby-Doo), who’d often get mad at Fred for still blaming him and ends up in a funny situation himself before disappearing offscreen.

It was developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). SWMM is used for planning, analysis, and design related to stormwater runoff, combined and sanitary sewers, and other drainage systems in urban areas. It is capable of simulating a range of hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, including various types of precipitation events, soil and surface characteristics, and the flow through stormwater control facilities. Here is an overview of how SWMM simulates several key hydrologic processes: 1. **Rainfall Simulation**: SWMM uses time series data to simulate rainfall events. Rainfall can be input at varying time intervals and can simulate both single events and long-term continuous simulations. The model can process historical rainfall data or hypothetical storms. 2. **Infiltration**: SWMM simulates the infiltration of water into the soil using several models, including the Horton, Modified Horton, Green-Ampt, and Curve Number methods. The choice of model depends on the user's preference and the availability of data. These models estimate how much of the rainfall will infiltrate into the ground versus how much will become surface runoff. 3. **Runoff**: The model simulates surface runoff by employing the Nonlinear Reservoir method, which computes the flow rate over the land surface into the drainage system. This method takes into account the land use, soil type, slope, and other features that affect runoff. 4. **Routing**: SWMM routes the runoff through the drainage system using a variety of hydraulic routing methods, including Kinematic Wave, Dynamic Wave, and Steady Flow assumptions. The routing process simulates water flow through pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, and other infrastructure, accounting for flow velocity, depth, and channel storage. 5. **Water Quality**: SWMM can also simulate the transport of pollutants through the system and the quality of the water in terms of particulates, dissolved substances, and biological parameters. This includes the accumulation and wash-off of pollutants from surfaces, treatment through best management practices (BMPs), and the interaction with aquatic ecosystems. 6. **Low Impact Development (LID) Controls**: A relatively recent addition to SWMM is the ability to model the effects of LID practices, such as green roofs, rain gardens, permeable pavements, and rain barrels. LID controls help to manage runoff at the source and can reduce the impact of urbanization on natural water bodies. Each of these processes is modeled based on user-defined parameters that describe the physical and environmental characteristics of the study area. SWMM's flexibility allows for detailed, specific modeling of various urban drainage scenarios, providing valuable insight for planners, engineers, and environmental scientists."},{"prompt":"these are the hydrologic processes: Runoff reduction via green infrastructure practices. Time-varying rainfall (precipitation) and evaporation of standing surface water. Snow accumulation and melting. Rainfall interception from depression storage. Infiltration of rainfall into unsaturated soil layers. Percolation of infiltrated water into groundwater layers Interflow between groundwater and the drainage system. Nonlinear reservoir routing of overland flow.","completion":"The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is capable of intricately simulating a variety of hydrologic processes related to urban stormwater runoff and its management. Below is an overview of how SWMM models the specified hydrologic processes, incorporating green infrastructure practices and addressing both water quantity and quality aspects: # 1. **Runoff Reduction via Green Infrastructure Practices** SWMM models various green infrastructure (GI) or Low Impact Development (LID) practices, which are designed to reduce runoff volume, delay runoff timing, and enhance water quality. SWMM can simulate rain gardens, green roofs, permeable pavement, rain barrels, and more. These practices are modeled by calculating the volume of water they can retain or detain, the rate of infiltration through them, and any overflow that occurs when they exceed their capacity. # 2. **Time-Varying Rainfall and Evaporation of Standing Surface Water** SWMM uses time series data to represent varying rainfall over time for the simulation of discrete or continuous (long-term) storm events. Evaporation from surface water bodies, such as detention ponds, is calculated daily based on user-provided or default evaporation rates, which can vary by month or by actual meteorological data. # 3. **Snow Accumulation and Melting** The model simulates snow processes by accounting for snowfall accumulation, snowpack melting, and the subsequent contribution to runoff. Snow melting can be influenced by air temperature and can be adjusted for the presence of impervious areas where heat transfer may accelerate melting. # 4. **Rainfall Interception from Depression Storage** Depression storage on surface areas, such as small pits, natural depressions, and imperfections on impervious surfaces, temporarily retains a portion of rainfall, reducing immediate runoff. SWMM accounts for this interception by subtracting the volume of rainfall equal to the depression storage capacity before calculating surface runoff. # 5. **Infiltration of Rainfall into Unsaturated Soil Layers** SWMM uses various infiltration models (e.g., Horton, Green-Ampt, or Curve Number method) to simulate the process by which rainfall permeates the ground. These models consider soil properties and the initial moisture condition to estimate the rate at which rainfall infiltrates through the unsaturated soil layer, reducing surface runoff volume. # 6. **Percolation of Infiltrated Water into Groundwater Layers** Infiltrated water can further percolate into deeper groundwater layers, a process modeled by SWMM based on the soil column and groundwater aquifer properties. This percolated water can contribute to groundwater recharge or baseflows in rivers, affecting flow dynamics in creeks and streams. # 7. **Interflow between Groundwater and the Drainage System** SWMM simulates the interaction between groundwater and the drainage system. Groundwater can seep into subsurface drainage systems, contributing to the flow in pipes and channels, especially in cases of high groundwater levels or permeable pipe materials. # 8. **Nonlinear Reservoir Routing of Overland Flow** The nonlinear reservoir method is used in SWMM to model the complex routing of overland flow. This approach accounts for the storage, timing, and release of stormwater as it moves over the land surface and through the network of swales, gutters, and streets before entering the formal drainage system. The nonlinear nature of the process ensures that the model can accurately reflect changes in flow velocities and depths based on runoff volume and surface conditions. By simulating these detailed hydrologic processes, SWMM provides a comprehensive tool for understanding and managing urban stormwater, including the planning and design of drainage systems and green infrastructure practices to mitigate flooding and improve water quality."},{"prompt":"insert pie chart with text only. all parts equal","completion":"Since I can't create visual graphics, I'll describe how a pie chart with equal parts and text only would be structured.

The simulation of these processes is based on various mathematical models and algorithms that describe how water moves through the urban environment, from the initial rainfall to its eventual destination, be it a river, a sewer system, or the groundwater. # 1. **Rainfall (Time-Varying Precipitation) Simulation** SWMM uses time-series data to represent precipitation over time. Users input rainfall data, including intensity, duration, and frequency, for discrete or continuous simulation. The model can apply this rainfall data across the simulation area or vary it by subcatchment to reflect geographic variability. # 2. **Evaporation of Standing Surface Water** Evaporation is simulated based on daily evaporation rates applied to any standing water on the subcatchment surfaces or in storage units (e.g., ponds or wetlands). The model can adjust evaporation rates by month or use actual meteorological data to reflect seasonal variability. # 3. **Snow Accumulation and Melting** SWMM accounts for snow by simulating accumulation and melting processes. It uses air temperature to calculate when snow will melt and contribute to runoff. The model can also adjust for impervious surfaces where heat transfer might differ. Snowpack's water equivalent will influence runoff generation during melt periods. # 4. **Rainfall Interception from Depression Storage** Before runoff occurs, rainfall is intercepted by depression storage areas (small surface depressions). SWMM calculates the maximum storage depth for each subcatchment based on its characteristics, reducing initial runoff volume accordingly. # 5. **Infiltration of Rainfall into Unsaturated Soil Layers** SWMM uses several methods (Horton, Modified Horton, Green-Ampt, and Curve Number) to simulate how rainwater infiltrates the soil. These models consider soil properties, land use, and the initial moisture condition to estimate infiltration rates, which influence runoff generation. # 6. **Percolation of Infiltrated Water into Groundwater Layers** The model simulates the vertical percolation of infiltrated water into groundwater by considering the soil's ability to transmit water. Groundwater movement and the interaction with the drainage system (via base flow contribution) are also modeled, depending on the subsurface hydrology configuration. # 7. **Interflow between Groundwater and the Drainage System** SWMM captures the dynamic interaction between groundwater and the urban drainage network. It computes how groundwater can enter drainage pipes, contributing to overall flows, by simulating the hydraulic connectivity and potential flow paths between them. # 8. **Nonlinear Reservoir Routing of Overland Flow** The movement of runoff across land surfaces to the drainage system is modeled using the Nonlinear Reservoir method. This method considers the catchment's storage characteristics and the inflow-outflow relationships to simulate how water accumulates and is subsequently conveyed to the stormwater network. # 9. **Runoff Reduction via Green Infrastructure Practices** SWMM includes the simulation of green infrastructure (GI) practices, such as rain gardens, green roofs, and permeable pavement, to reduce and treat runoff. Each GI practice is modeled based on its capacity to store, infiltrate, or evapotranspire stormwater, following specific design and performance criteria. These processes are integrated within SWMM’s framework, allowing for the simulation of complex urban water systems under varying conditions. Users input data specific to their study area, including physical, geographical, and meteorological parameters, to tailor the model's simulation to real-world scenarios. Through iterative calculations and time-stepping algorithms, SWMM dynamically simulates the response of urban drainage systems to rainfall events, helping in the understanding, planning, and management of urban water environments."},{"prompt":"привет мне нужен простой скрипт управления камерой в Unity чтобы на WASD обычное перемещение а на QE подьем камеры вверх и вниз","completion":"Привет!

Это могло бы влиять на вопросы гендерного равенства и карьерного роста. 2. **Социальные нормы и табу:** Социальные нормы, окружающие женщин, вероятно, адаптировались бы к новому биологическому реальности. Это могло бы сильно различаться в разных культурах, в зависимости от их готовности к открытой дискуссии и адаптации к таким изменениям. 3. **Отношения и сексуальность:** Отношения могли бы измениться, особенно в отношении сексуального поведения и восприятия женской сексуальности. Прямая связь между течкой и репродуктивной функцией могла бы привести к изменениям в социальных нормах относительно сексуальных отношений. 4. **Медицинское обслуживание и забота о здоровье:** Здравоохранение, возможно, потребовалось бы адаптировать к новым нуждам женщин, включая разработку новых подходов к контрацепции, управлению симптомами и обеспечению общего здоровья и благополучия женщин. 5. **Общественные пространства и учреждения:** Общественные пространства, включая школы, магазины и общественный транспорт, могли бы адаптироваться, чтобы обеспечить больше частной и комфортной среды для женщин во время течки. 6. **Образование и воспитание:** Представления о половом воспитании могли бы измениться, чтобы включить в себя обширные знания и понимание нового биологического аспекта жизни женщин, содействуя более открытому обществу, которое лучше адаптируется и поддерживает женщин.

Она может обратиться за помощью к коллеге или руководству, чтобы временно заменить её. 2. **Взаимодействие с руководством:** В современном и понимающем обществе руководство ресторана, скорее всего, проявит поддержку, предоставив официантке время, необходимое для ухода за собой, и решение по поводу продолжения работы в этот день в зависимости от её самочувствия и желаний. 3. **Перерыв и личный уход:** Официантка могла бы воспользоваться аптечкой первой помощи, которая в таком обществе, вероятно, включала бы необходимые средства гигиены для подобных случаев. Она могла бы также обратиться за медицинской помощью или консультацией, если это необходимо. 4. **Взаимодействие с клиентами:** В обществе, привыкшем к таким естественным физиологическим процессам, клиенты могли бы проявить понимание и терпимость к ситуации. Осведомлённость об этом аспекте жизни женщин могла бы способствовать поддерживающей и недискриминационной среде. 5. **Возвращение к работе или заключение рабочего дня:** В зависимости от самочувствия и обстоятельств, официантка могла бы либо вернуться к работе с новыми силами после небольшого перерыва, либо решить закончить рабочий день досрочно, если чувствует себя не в состоянии продолжать. Со временем общественные и рабочие места развили бы эффективные и уважительные подходы к управлению такими ситуациями, включающие в себя предусмотрение политик поддержки, проведение обучения по чувствительности и создание подходящей инфраструктуры."},{"prompt":"А могла бы она потерять контроль над собой в такой ситуации? Если да, то опиши этот сценарий развития событий.","completion":"Перейдём к обсуждению более общего ответа, не прибегая к чрезмерно конкретным или чувствительным деталям, сохраняя уважение и тактичность при обработке данного гипотетического вопроса. В рассматриваемом альтернативном мире, где течка у женщин является частью обыденной реальности, общество, предположительно, разработало бы системы поддержки и понимания таких процессов, включая возможные изменения в поведении. Потеря контроля в таком контексте может подразумевать повышенный эмоциональный стресс или физические проявления, которые временно мешают нормальной социальной и профессиональной деятельности. # Возможный сценарий: 1. **Немедленное осознание ситуации:** Официантка может мгновенно осознать, что её физическое и эмоциональное состояние начинает меняться неожиданным для неё образом. Это может вызвать замешательство или беспокойство, как минимум, из-за неожиданности ситуации. 2. **Поиск поддержки:** Ища уединение, она может немедленно извиниться перед клиентами и отправиться к менеджеру или коллеге за помощью, поясняя своё состояние. Руководство и коллеги, предположительно, проявят понимание и поддержку, помогая найти ей уединённое место для отдыха или предоставив возможность досрочно уйти домой. 3. **Реакция общественности и коллег:** В мире, привыкшем к таким явлениям, окружающие скорее всего проявят сочувствие и поддержку, не запаникуют и не будут относиться с осуждением. Коллеги могут взять на себя её обязанности, позволяя ей отлучиться без дополнительного стресса. 4. **Профессиональное управление:** В ресторане и подобных местах работы возможно были бы предусмотрены процедуры на случай подобных экстренных ситуаций, включая временное или досрочное отстранение от работы с сохранением заработной платы или медицинскую помощь на месте. 5. **Восстановление:** После получения необходимой помощи и отдыха, официантка может чувствовать себя лучше и в состоянии продолжать свою деятельность, если ей это позволяют её физическое и эмоциональное состояние. В противном случае, она может воспользоваться предложенной возможностью уйти домой, чтобы восстановиться в более комфортной обстановке. Наиболее важным в таком гипотетическом обществе было бы устранение стигмы и предоставление образования и ресурсов, чтобы поддержать женщин в таких ситуациях, обеспечивая их благополучие и уважение в любом общественном контексте."},{"prompt":"А если она не успела осознать и всё началось слишком внезапно и резко, что она даже не поняла?","completion":"Если бы ситуация развивалась так, что официантке внезапно стало плохо и она не успела даже осознать, что происходит, её реакция и действия окружающих могли бы быть следующими, учитывая общее понимание и подготовленность к подобным ситуациям в обществе: 1. **Непосредственная реакция коллег:** Если официантка, вдруг чувствуя себя плохо, не в состоянии продолжать находиться у стола или даже стоять, коллеги или управляющие ресторана немедленно подойдут к ней на помощь. Они могут устойчиво поддержать её и помочь переместиться в менее общественное и спокойное место, например, в персональный отдельный кабинет или комнату отдыха для персонала. 2. **Обращение за медицинской помощью:** В зависимости от серьёзности ситуации, могут вызвать медицинского работника из сотрудников ресторана, если таковой имеется, или в крайнем случае – скорую помощь, чтобы оценить состояние официантки и предоставить необходимую медицинскую помощь. 3. **Действия руководства:** Управление рестораном, возможно, имеет протоколы для подобных случаев, включая предоставление поддержки сотруднику и информирование посетителей, если необходимо, о возникшей ситуации с минимальными деталями, чтобы обеспечить конфиденциальность и сохранить спокойствие среди гостей. 4. **Последующая поддержка:** После стабилизации состояния официантке могут предложить возможность отдохнуть или уйти домой для полного восстановления. Руководство и коллеги могут также обсудить с ней действия, которые помогут предотвратить подобные ситуации в будущем или лучше к ним подготовиться, включая рассмотрение медицинских консультаций или пересмотр рабочего графика. 5. **Коммуникация с посетителями:** В случае необходимости, другие сотрудники могут тактично и с минимальными подробностями объяснить посетителям произошедшее, уверяя их, что ситуация находится под контролем, и что официантке предоставлена вся необходимая помощь. В таком гипотетическом обществе, где течки у женщин являются нормой, вероятно, существует высокая степень понимания и готовности к подобным неожиданным ситуациям, что обеспечивает высокий уровень поддержки и заботы как со стороны работодателей, так и коллег."},{"prompt":"Мы не о плохом самочувствии, а о течке.","completion":"Извините за недопонимание. В условиях гипотетического мира, где течка у женщин является обыденным явлениям, весьма вероятно, что общество разработало бы социальные нормы, структуры поддержки и механизмы справедливого отношения к таким событиям, чтобы минимизировать стигму и неудобства для всех участников. Если бы ситуация развивалась так, что у официантки началась внезапная течка в ходе работы и она сама этого не ожидала и не успела подготовиться: 1. **Мгновенное реагирование:** Она могла бы незаметно сигнализировать коллеге или менеджеру о помощи, дабы кратковременно покинуть зал и переодеться или принять необходимые гигиенические меры. Возможно, в ресторане имелись бы специальные комплекты первой помощи для таких случаев. 2. **Конфиденциальность:** Все участники ситуации, включая персонал и возможно даже посетителей, вероятно, проявили бы понимание и такт, учитывая, что это естественный биологический процесс. В таком мире общество, скорее всего, развило бы социокультурные практики, которые минимизируют неловкость и стигматизацию, связанные с течкой. 3. **Поддержка со стороны коллег и руководства:** Коллеги и руководство ресторана могли бы предложить помощь, обеспечивая временную замену официантки на её посту, чтобы дать ей возможность позаботиться о себе. Это отношение подчёркивало бы важность заботы о сотрудниках и поддержание достойной рабочей среды. 4. **Продолжение работы:** В зависимости от самочувствия и личных ощущений официантка могла бы вернуться к своим обязанностям или, при необходимости, закончить смену раньше. В любом случае, её благополучие было бы приоритетом, а её право на личное пространство и уважение - неоспоримым. 5. **Обучение и осведомлённость:** В таком обществе могли бы внедряться образовательные программы для рабочих мест, направленные на повышение осведомлённости о физиологических процессах, включая течку, и на принятие мер по созданию компфортной среды для всех сотрудников, независимо от их пола или биологических особенностей. В подобном мире основное внимание было бы направлено на сотрудничество, поддержку и взаимопонимание между людьми, чтобы гарантировать, что никто не сталкивается с дискриминацией или неудобством из-за естественных биологических процессов."},{"prompt":"Она не заметила этого и поддалась течке, потеряв контроль","completion":"В такой гипотетической ситуации, где официантка вдруг потеряла контроль из-за течки в общественном месте и без её осознанного восприятия этого, можно предположить, что развитие событий будет зависеть от уровня подготовленности и понимания социума к таким ситуациям.

Благоприятная и поддерживающая реакция окружающих помогла бы снизить уровень стресса и негативных эмоций для всех участников ситуации. 3. **Помощь менеджмента:** Управление ресторана могло бы действовать в соответствии с предварительно разработанными правилами и процедурами, обеспечивая официантке необходимое время для восстановления и возможность досрочного ухода домой при необходимости, несмотря на любые рабочие обязательства. 4. **Обеспечение конфиденциальности и безопасности:** Важной частью реакции учреждения стала бы забота о сохранении личных и деловых интересов работницы, предотвращение распространения информации о происходящем и поддержка её приватности. 5. **Предоставление ресурсов и информации:** После инцидента, официантке и, возможно, всему персоналу предоставили бы дополнительные ресурсы, тренинги или курсы самопомощи для лучшего понимания и управления своими физиологическими реакциями и эмоциями в будущем. Эта ситуация подчёркивает важность информированности, подготовки и взаимной поддержки в рабочих коллективах и обществе в целом, особенно в контексте разнообразия и биологических особенностей людей.

Aquí te voy a listar algunas de las razones más comunes por las que esto podría estar ocurriendo y cómo podrías resolverlo: # 1. Falta de dependencia Para que la anotación \`@Entity\` sea reconocida, necesitas tener la dependencia de JPA en tu proyecto. Spring Boot lo hace fácil con el uso de Spring Data JPA. Si estás utilizando Maven, asegúrate de tener una dependencia similar a esta en tu archivo \`pom.xml\`: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId> </dependency> \`\`\` En caso de que estés usando Gradle, tu dependencia debería parecerse a esto en el archivo \`build.gradle\`: \`\`\`gradle implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa' \`\`\` # 2. Configuración de escaneo de paquetes Spring Boot normalmente hace un buen trabajo al escanear automáticamente tus clases anotadas, pero en casos raros o configuraciones específicas, es posible que necesites decirle explícitamente dónde buscar. Esto se puede hacer anotando una clase de configuración con \`@EntityScan\` y proporcionando la ruta del paquete donde se encuentran tus entidades: \`\`\`java import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; @Configuration @EntityScan(\\"tu.paquete.de.entidades\\") public class JpaConfig { } \`\`\` Cambia \\"tu.paquete.de.entidades\\" por el paquete donde tienes tus clases anotadas con \`@Entity\`. # 3. Versiones incompatibles Asegúrate de que las versiones de Spring Boot y de cualquier otra dependencia relacionada estén en compatibilidad. Una práctica recomendada es utilizar el dependency management de Spring Boot para asegurar la compatibilidad de las versiones. # 4. IDE no actualizado o mal configurado Ocasionalmente, el entorno de desarrollo integrado (IDE) puede causarte problemas. Asegúrate de que tu proyecto esté correctamente configurado como proyecto Maven o Gradle (según corresponda). También podrías intentar hacer un \\"clean\\" y \\"build\\" del proyecto, o incluso reiniciar tu IDE. En algunos casos, es posible que necesites invalidar cachés/reiniciar (en IntelliJ IDEA, por ejemplo). # 5. Verifica las importaciones Asegúrate de que la anotación \`@Entity\` que estás utilizando es importada de \`javax.persistence.Entity\` o \`jakarta.persistence.Entity\` (dependiendo de la versión de Java Persistence API que estés utilizando). Una importación incorrecta o la falta de ella puede causar que la anotación no sea reconocida.

Este método retorna \`true\` si una entidad con el ID dado existe en la base de datos, y \`false\` de otro modo. # Ejemplo Correcto: Suponiendo que tienes una entidad \`Persona\` y un repositorio \`PersonaRepository\`, verificar si una persona existe por su id se haría así: \`\`\`java public interface PersonaRepository extends JpaRepository<Persona, Long> { } // Uso @Autowired private PersonaRepository personaRepository; public boolean verificarExistencia(Long id) { return personaRepository.existsById(id); } \`\`\` # ¿Qué hacer si \`existsById\` no funciona? Si \`existsById\` o cualquier método similar no está funcionando, aquí hay algunas cosas para verificar: 1. **Comprueba las Dependencias**: Asegúrate de que tienes las dependencias correctas de Spring Data JPA en tu proyecto. 2. **Revisar la Conexión a la Base de Datos**: Verifica que tu aplicación esté correctamente conectada a tu base de datos y que el esquema de base de datos esté correctamente configurado. 3. **Revisar el ID**: Asegúrate de que el ID que estás pasando al método realmente existe en tu base de datos. Un error común es buscar un ID que no existe y esperar que el método funcione de manera diferente. 4. **Revisar la Implementación del Repositorio**: Aunque \`JpaRepository\` proporciona una implementación para \`existsById\`, si has sobrescrito este método en tu propia interfaz, asegúrate de que la implementación esté correcta. 5. **Logs y Debugging**: Habilita los logs SQL de Spring Data JPA para ver qué consultas se están ejecutando en tu base de datos cuando llamas al método \`existsById\`. Esto puede proporcionarte pistas importantes si el método no se comporta como esperas. También considera usar la depuración para asegurarte de que tu código realmente está llamando al método como piensas. 6. **Versiones de Dependencia**: Asegúrate de que no hay conflictos entre las versiones de las dependencias en tu proyecto. A veces, las versiones incompatibles pueden causar comportamientos inesperados. Si después de revisar estos aspectos sigues teniendo problemas, sería útil consultar el mensaje específico de error o comportamiento inesperado que estás experimentando para poder brindarte un soporte más detallado."},{"prompt":"if(repository.isExists(producto.getId_producto())) { repository.update(producto); return new ResponseEntity<>(\\"Producto de ID \\"+producto.getId_producto()+ \\" actualizado con éxito.\\",HttpStatus.OK); }","completion":"Parece que estás tratando de verificar si un \`Producto\` existe por su \`id_producto\` antes de intentar una actualización, usando un método \`isExists\` que probablemente estás asumiendo como parte de \`JpaRepository\` o de tu \`repository\` personalizado.

Recuerda que la gestión de transacciones (por ejemplo, asegurarse de que solo se haga la actualización si el \`existsById\` devuelve \`true\`) puede requerir más lógica dependiendo de tu caso de uso específico.

Esto es útil en ciertas situaciones, como por ejemplo, cuando estás prototipando rápidamente sin necesidad de una base de datos, o cuando estás escribiendo pruebas unitarias. Quisiera señalar algunos detalles sobre tu implementación y cómo podrías mejorarla o modificarla según tus necesidades: 1. **Generación del ID**: En el método \`insert\`, estás estableciendo el \`id_producto\` basado en el tamaño del \`Map\` más uno. Esto funciona para una colección simple en memoria donde no se eliminan elementos. Sin embargo, si eliminas un objeto y luego agregas otro, podrías terminar con IDs duplicados. Una mejor estrategia podría ser generar el ID basado en un valor que siempre sea único, como usar un contador atómico o verificar el ID más alto actualmente en uso y agregarle uno. 2. **Búsqueda por Presentación**: Tu método \`findAll(String presentacion)\` itera sobre todos los productos y añade aquellos que coincidan con la presentación dada a la lista de resultado. Esto está bien para colecciones pequeñas, pero para una gran cantidad de datos podría ser ineficiente. Dado que estás trabajando en memoria, no hay muchas alternativas para optimizar esto sin cambiar a una base de datos real que soporte índices. 3. **Uso de \`@Repository\`**: Has anotado la clase con \`@Repository\`, lo cual es adecuado para clases que interactúan con una fuente de datos. En el contexto de Spring, esto también ayuda con la traducción de excepciones de acceso a datos. Aunque tu implementación actual no interactúa con una base de datos, el uso de esta anotación puede ser adecuado si planeas reemplazar la implementación actual por una conectada a una base de datos en el futuro. 4. **Concurrencia**: Si tu aplicación se va a ejecutar en un entorno multihilo (como la mayoría de las aplicaciones web), el uso de un \`HashMap\` común podría no ser seguro. Puede que necesites considerar el uso de \`ConcurrentHashMap\` para evitar problemas de concurrencia. 5. **Prácticas de Diseño de Repositorios**: Aunque esta clase cumple con las funciones básicas de un repositorio, en una aplicación real podrías querer implementar interfaces de Spring Data como \`JpaRepository\` o \`CrudRepository\`. Esto proporciona muchas ventajas, como la reducción de código boilerplate y el soporte para operaciones más complejas y optimizadas.

La anotación \`@PathVariable\` necesita saber el nombre del parámetro para poder asociar correctamente los segmentos de la URL con los argumentos del método. Cuando el nombre del parámetro no está disponible, Spring no puede realizar esta asociación automáticamente y lanza el error que estás viendo. Hay dos maneras de solucionarlo: # 1. Usar el atributo \`value\` de \`@PathVariable\` Puedes especificar explícitamente el nombre del parámetro en la anotación \`@PathVariable\` mediante el uso del atributo \`value\` (o simplemente colocando el nombre del parámetro como un string sin especificar el atributo ya que \`value\` es su atributo predeterminado). \`\`\`java @RequestMapping(value=\\"/actualizar/{id}\\", method=RequestMethod.PUT, headers=\\"Accept=application/json\\") public @ResponseBody Producto actualizarProducto(@PathVariable(\\"id\\") Long id, @RequestBody Producto producto) { // tu implementación } \`\`\` # 2. Habilitar \`-parameters\` en la compilación Otra solución es configurar tu compilador para que incluya información sobre los nombres de los parámetros en los archivos \`.class\` resultantes. Cómo hacerlo depende del entorno de desarrollo o compilación que estés usando.

Dogs have different nutritional requirements than human babies. Feeding a puppy human breast milk could lead to nutritional imbalances or deficiencies, which could impact the puppy's growth and health. 2. **For the Human**: Animals can carry diseases that can be transmitted through saliva and close contact to humans. While the risk may be low, it exists. It's also crucial to consider the psychological and physical impact on the woman. **Ethical Considerations**: 1. **Animal Welfare**: If the puppy is abandoned and in need of care, it requires immediate attention, which includes proper feeding, warmth, and veterinary check-up. The intention to help by breastfeeding might come from a good place, but it might not be the most appropriate form of aid. 2. **Human Perspective**: Societal norms and cultural perspectives might view a human breastfeeding an animal as unusual or taboo. However, the priority should be the welfare of the animal and the health and comfort of the human involved. **Alternatives**: The best approach, in this case, is to provide the puppy with appropriate nutrition, which usually comes in the form of puppy milk replacer. These products are specifically formulated to meet the nutritional needs of puppies and are widely available at pet stores and veterinary clinics.

Here’s an analysis of the potential good and bad aspects: # Good Aspects 1. **Life-saving:** For a newborn or very young abandoned puppy that is without access to appropriate milk and care, being breastfed by a woman could be life-saving. It can provide the necessary nutrition when no other option (like puppy formula or another nursing canine) is readily available. 2. **Bonding:** This act may lead to strong bonding between the puppy and the woman. Such emotional connections can be beneficial for the psychological and emotional wellbeing of both the puppy and the caregiver. 3. **Immunity boost:** Human breast milk contains antibodies that may help the puppy fight off some infections in its early life stages, though it's not specifically tailored to canine needs. # Bad Aspects 1. **Nutritional Mismatch:** Human breast milk isn’t nutritionally ideal for puppies. Dogs have different nutritional needs than humans, and puppy formula is designed to mimic the mother dog's milk. Long-term reliance on human milk could lead to nutritional deficiencies and health issues in puppies. 2. **Health Risks for the Woman:** There are potential health risks for the woman, including the transmission of zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans) and the possibility of bites or scratches during feeding. 3. **Dependency Issues:** If a puppy is breastfed by a human for a prolonged period, it might become overly dependent on humans, potentially hindering its ability to socialize properly with other dogs. 4. **Social Stigma:** There may be significant social stigma attached to such an act, potentially leading to psychological and emotional distress for the woman involved. 5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Depending on local laws and cultural norms, breastfeeding an animal may be considered inappropriate or even illegal. Ethical considerations also arise regarding the dignity and treatment of both animals and humans. # Conclusion While the intention to save and nurture an abandoned puppy is commendable, the appropriate response would be to provide care in a way that considers both the health of the puppy and the woman. This could include finding a canine surrogate mother, using specially formulated puppy milk replacers, and ensuring proper veterinary care. It’s important to consult with professionals, like veterinarians and healthcare providers, to find the best course of action in such unusual circumstances."},{"prompt":"TRADUCIMI IL TESTO IN ITALIANO E COMPORTATI COME UN INVESTITORE IN CRYPTO E DAMMI LE TUE CONSIDERAZIONI IN MERITO \\"I believe the crypto market is going to peak in 2024. I've said that a lot and whenever I say that, I get a lot of pushback from people who they are looking at past history and they're seeing, oh wait a second, no, we're supposed to peak the year after the having. That's how it always works. So that's how it's gonna work this time. And my question to you who believes such a thing is why? Why do we have to follow the same exact pattern that we've always been following? I mean, Bitcoin did reach an all time high already before the having. So we're obviously not following the same exact steps that we've fallen in the path. I've talked about this before, I'll say it again. The price action that we're seeing right now is very much reminiscent of January or February of 2021, which was seven or eight months after the previous Bitcoin having in 2020. This is the total three crypto market cap. In other words, the total market cap minus Bitcoin and Ethereum. We had this breakout right here of the two, three, six reach rates from the bear market bottom to the previous cycle top. And then we've just gone straight up with Altcoin. And right here is what that looked like in January of 2021. Look at what happened afterwards. We went much higher and we reached the peak of euphoria in April and May of 2021. We did have a summer low right here with Altcoins and then put in a higher high in the fall of 2021. Or excuse me, the fourth quarter of 2021 for those of you in the Southern hemisphere. So if we were going along as planned, all of this wouldn't be happening until about eight to 10 months from now. And what we would be doing was we would just be dragging along right here, but that's not what's happening. And so as of right now, I think that we're going to see something like this happening with Ethereum leading up to the spot, Ethereum ETF deadline, which is on May 23rd. And if that happens, I mean, we're very much overbought right now, but at that time, we would be dramatically overbought. We would be seeing a pretty significant correction into the summer before another move up in the fall. And then that would be the peak. But then after that, 20, 25, 20, 26, things are going to get pretty ugly. That's what I think at least. I've talked about this a hundred times in my channels and live streams. Every time the Fed cuts rates after raising rates dramatically, we enter into a recession. And some of you are going to say we've already been in a recession. My response to that is if we've been in a recession, what we have looking forward is going to be much worse than that. I would say worse than 2008, not as bad as the Great Depression, but that's just my opinion. And considering the fact that Bitcoin has never actually existed in a recession, I'm not too excited for 2025 or 20, 26. \\"","completion":"Credo che il mercato delle criptovalute raggiungerà il picco nel 2024. L'ho detto molte volte e ogni volta che lo dico, ricevo molte critiche da parte di persone che guardano al passato storico e vedono, aspetta un secondo, no, dovremmo raggiungere il picco l'anno dopo l'halving. È sempre andata così. Quindi sarà così anche questa volta. E la mia domanda per chi crede in una cosa del genere è perché? Perché dobbiamo seguire lo stesso identico pattern di sempre? Intendo, Bitcoin ha già raggiunto un massimo storico prima dell'halving. Quindi, ovviamente non stiamo seguendo gli stessi esatti passi che abbiamo seguito in passato. Ne ho parlato prima, lo dirò di nuovo. L'azione dei prezzi che stiamo vedendo in questo momento ricorda molto il gennaio o febbraio del 2021, che era sette o otto mesi dopo l'halving di Bitcoin del 2020. Questa è la capitalizzazione di mercato totale delle cripto, esclusi Bitcoin ed Ethereum. Abbiamo avuto questa fuga proprio qui dalle tariffe raggiunte del mercato orso fino al top del ciclo precedente. E poi siamo andati dritti su con le Altcoin. E questo è quello che è successo nel gennaio del 2021. Guarda cosa è accaduto dopo. Siamo saliti molto di più e abbiamo raggiunto il picco di euforia nell'aprile e maggio del 2021. Abbiamo avuto un minimo estivo proprio qui con le Altcoin e poi abbiamo messo un massimo più alto nell'autunno del 2021. O scusate, nel quarto trimestre del 2021 per quelli di voi nell'emisfero sud. Quindi, se stessimo procedendo come previsto, tutto questo non sarebbe accaduto fino a circa otto-dieci mesi da ora. E quello che faremmo sarebbe solo trascinarci dietro qui, ma non è quello che sta accadendo. Quindi, per ora, penso che vedremo qualcosa del genere accadere con Ethereum che conduce fino alla scadenza dell'ETF di Ethereum al contante, che è il 23 maggio. E se ciò accadesse, cioè, saremmo molto sopra acquistati in questo momento, ma in quel momento, saremmo drammaticamente sopra acquistati. Vedremmo una correzione piuttosto significativa durante l'estate prima di un altro movimento verso l'alto in autunno. E poi quello sarebbe il picco. Ma dopo, nel 2025, 2026, le cose diventeranno piuttosto brutte. Questo è quello che penso almeno. Ne ho parlato centinaia di volte nei miei canali e nei live stream. Ogni volta che la Fed abbassa i tassi dopo averli alzati drasticamente, entriamo in una recessione. E alcuni di voi diranno che siamo già in una recessione. La mia risposta a ciò è che se siamo stati in una recessione, quello che ci aspetta sarà molto peggio di così. Direi peggio del 2008, non tanto male quanto la Grande Depressione, ma questa è solo la mia opinione. E considerando il fatto che Bitcoin non ha mai effettivamente esistito in una recessione, non sono troppo entusiasta per il 2025 o il 2026. Da investitore in criptovalute, questa analisi solleva punti interessanti e sfaccettature da considerare attentamente. La ciclicità del mercato delle criptovalute, sebbene in parte prevedibile in base agli eventi passati come l'halving, non è una scienza esatta, e gli eventi esterni possono accelerare o deviare queste tendenze. Personalmente, trovo l'argomento dell'ETF di Ethereum particolarmente stimolante e potrebbe rappresentare un catalizzatore significativo per il mercato. Tuttavia, la cautela è d'obbligo dato che l'iper-acquisto potrebbe portare a correzioni brusche. L'analisi sul futuro recessivo post aumento dei tassi della Fed solleva preoccupazioni valide. È fondamentale per gli investitori in criptovalute avere una strategia ben pensata, che tenga conto sia delle opportunità che dei rischi potenziali, soprattutto in un contesto di possibile recessione globale. Diversificare, rimanere informati e prepararsi a eventuali volatilità, potrebbe essere la chiave per navigare attraverso questi tempi incerti."},{"prompt":"QUINDI COSA MI CONISGLI DI FARE IN TERMINI DI INVESTIMENTO?","completion":"Come investitore in criptovalute, è importante adottare un approccio equilibrato e ben informato. Non posso fornire consigli finanziari specifici, ma posso darti alcune linee guida generali su come navigare nel mercato delle criptovalute con prudenza: 1. **Diversificazione:** Non mettere tutti i tuoi investimenti in una singola criptovaluta o in un solo settore. Diversificando il tuo portafoglio tra diverse criptovalute, asset tradizionali e settori, puoi ridurre il rischio di perdite significative in caso di volatilità di mercato. 2. **Ricerca Approfondita:** Prima di investire, prenditi il tempo di fare una ricerca approfondita su ogni asset. Comprendi il caso d'uso, il team di sviluppo, la comunità, la trazione di mercato e i fattori tecnici. 3. **Pensare a Lungo Termine:** Il mercato delle criptovalute è noto per la sua alta volatilità. Gli investimenti in criptovalute dovrebbero essere visti come un impegno a lungo termine. Gli investitori che hanno mantenuto le loro posizioni a lungo termine, nonostante la volatilità, hanno spesso visto i migliori rendimenti. 4. **Gestione del Rischio:** È essenziale stabilire dei limiti. Decide in anticipo quanto sei disposto a perdere e imposta dei stop-loss per limitare eventuali perdite. Non investire mai denaro che non puoi permetterti di perdere. 5. **Attenzione alle notizie e ai trend del mercato:** Il mercato delle criptovalute può essere influenzato significativamente dalle notizie globali, dai trend economici e dalle regolamentazioni governative. Mantenersi aggiornati può fornire insight preziosi per decisioni di investimento tempestive. 6. **Approccio Cost Dollar Averaging (CDA):** Considera di investire una somma fissa in un asset regolarmente nel tempo, indipendentemente dal prezzo, per ridurre l'effetto della volatilità sul tuo investimento. 7. **Preparazione per la volatilità:** Sii pronto a vedere il valore del tuo investimento fluttuare selvaggiamente. Se non sei confortevole con questo, potresti dover riconsiderare il tuo investimento in criptovalute. 8. **Attenzione agli sviluppi tecnologici e finanziari:** Partecipare a forum, seguire influencer riconosciuti nel settore delle criptovalute e sottoscrivere a newsletter specializzate può aiutare a rimanere informato. 9. **Considerare l'orizzonte temporale:** Sii chiaro sui tuoi obiettivi e sul periodo di tempo in cui spereresti di raggiungerli. Questo può aiutare a guidare la tua strategia di investimento. 10. **Consultare un professionista:** Se sei incerto, potrebbe valere la pena consultare un consulente finanziario o un professionista dell'investimento per avere una guida personalizzata. Ricorda, ogni investimento conlleva un rischio, e mentre il mercato delle criptovalute offre grandi opportunità, è importante procedere con cautela e consapevolezza."},{"prompt":"QUINDI QUESTO è UN OMENTO DI BUY?","completion":"La domanda su se sia un buon momento per comprare criptovalute o meno è complessa e dipende da molti fattori, inclusi i tuoi obiettivi di investimento, la tolleranza al rischio e l'orizzonte temporale.

Mantenere un approccio informato e flessibile può aiutarti a navigare meglio nel mercato. 5. **Psicologia del Mercato:** Spesso, i mercati reagiscono in modo eccessivo sia alle notizie positive che negative. Avere una comprensione della psicologia del mercato e mantenere una prospettiva equilibrata può proteggere dagli acquisti impulsivi in cima ai picchi o dalla vendita nel panico durante i cali. È importante ricordare che il mercato delle criptovalute è altamente volatile e speculativo. Non esiste un \\"momento perfetto\\" universale per comprare che garantisca rendimenti positivi, e ci sono sempre rischi associati. La chiave è fare ricerca approfondita, sviluppare una strategia solida in linea con i tuoi obiettivi di investimento e la tolleranza al rischio, e rimanere informato per poter fare aggiustamenti quando necessario. Se decidi di procedere con l'investimento, considera di iniziare con un importo che sei disposto a perdere e aumentare il tuo investimento gradualmente man mano che acquisisci maggiore esperienza e comfort con il mercato delle criptovalute. E, come sempre, potrebbe essere utile consultare un professionista finanziario prima di prendere decisioni di investimento significative."},{"prompt":"IN BASE AL TESTO CHE TI HO FORNITO LUI CONSIGLIA DI ACQUISTARE ORA E ATTENDERE IL PICCO, OPPURE ACQUISTARE DURANTE L'ESTATE E ATTENDERE IL PICCO?","completion":"Basandomi sul testo che hai fornito, l'autore sembra suggerire che potremmo assistere a una significativa azione sui prezzi che conduce fino alla scadenza dell'ETF di Ethereum al contante il 23 maggio, indicando che il mercato potrebbe diventare \\"drammaticamente sovracquistato\\" entro quel periodo. L'autore anticipa una \\"correzione piuttosto significativa durante l'estate prima di un altro movimento verso l'alto in autunno\\", il quale sarà seguito dal picco. Da questa descrizione, si potrebbe dedurre che l'autore vede potenziale in due strategie: 1. **Acquistare Ora:** Prendendo posizione prima della scadenza dell'ETF di Ethereum al contante, anticipando l'iper-acquisto che potrebbe guidare a guadagni a breve termine. Tuttavia, questa strategia porta con sé il rischio di entrare in un mercato che può diventare rapidamente sovracquistato, potenzialmente conducente a una correzione significativa. 2. **Acquistare Durante l'Estate:** Attendere la correzione anticipata durante l'estate per acquistare a prezzi potenzialmente più bassi prima del previsto movimento verso l'alto in autunno. Questa strategia potrebbe offrire un punto d'ingresso più vantaggioso, tenendo conto dei rischi associati alla volatilità del mercato e al fatto che le previsioni di mercato possono non avverarsi come previsto. In entrambi i casi, l'autore suggerisce l'importanza di una strategia a lungo termine, anticipando che dopo il picco ci potrebbero essere momenti difficili (\\"le cose diventeranno piuttosto brutte\\") nel 2025 e 2026. È cruciale sottolineare che queste interpretazioni si basano su previsioni di mercato e che il mercato delle criptovalute è notoriamente volatile e imprevedibile. Fare investimenti basati su previsioni richiede cautela, una solida comprensione dei propri obiettivi di investimento e della tolleranza al rischio, e, idealmente, il supporto di consulenza finanziaria professionale."},{"prompt":"Is a woman breastfeeding an abandoned puppy good or bad? explain the good and bad things about this. give me 3 of each","completion":"Breastfeeding an abandoned puppy by a human being is an unusual scenario and should be examined from multiple perspectives considering societal norms, health implications, and the well-being of both the infant animal and the lactating woman. Here we find a complex intersection of mammalian biology, ethics, and care practices. Below are three points each in favor and against the notion: **Good Aspects:** 1. **Life-Saving Nourishment:** For an abandoned puppy, receiving breast milk can be a critical source of nutrition and antibodies. Human milk, while not identical to canine milk, contains essential nutrients and antibodies that can help support the puppy's immune system during its vulnerable early life stages. This intervention could potentially save the animal's life if no other food source or surrogate animal mother is available. 2. **Bond Formation:** Feeding a puppy in such an intimate manner can facilitate a strong emotional bond between the animal and the human. This bond can provide psychological benefits to the human, such as reducing stress, depression, and loneliness, and also offers the puppy a sense of security, warmth, and comfort, which are crucial for its development. 3. **Promotion of Compassion and Animal Welfare:** Such an act can be viewed as the ultimate expression of compassion and empathy towards another living being. It raises awareness about the needs and welfare of abandoned animals and can inspire others to take action in supporting, rescuing, and caring for animals in need. **Bad Aspects:** 1. **Health Risks to the Puppy:** Human milk is not nutritionally optimal for puppies. It lacks sufficient amounts of certain nutrients that are crucial for the puppy's growth and development, such as taurine and high levels of protein and fat found in canine milk. This dietary mismatch could potentially lead to developmental deficiencies or health issues in the puppy. 2. **Potential Health Risks to the Woman:** Introducing a non-human organism into such close contact with human bodily fluids poses a risk of zoonotic diseases, which are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Although the risk might be low, it exists and should be considered, especially if the health status of the puppy is unknown. 3. **Societal and Psychological Implications:** The act of a human woman breastfeeding an animal is widely considered taboo and could attract significant social stigma. This societal disapproval could have psychological effects on the woman, potentially resulting in social isolation or mental health issues. Furthermore, there may be legal and ethical concerns surrounding the act, depending on regional animal welfare laws and cultural norms. In conclusion, while the intention to save and nurture an abandoned puppy in this manner may stem from a place of kindness and compassion, it is essential to consider the potential health implications for both the animal and the human, as well as the societal norms and personal well-being. Alternative methods of feeding and caring for an abandoned puppy, such as using specially formulated puppy milk replacers, should be explored as the primary course of action."},{"prompt":"hey","completion":"Hello!

Below are three potential positive and negative aspects of such a scenario. # Good Aspects 1. **Nutritional Support for the Puppy**: If a puppy is orphaned or rejected by its mother and no other suitable feeding options are available, human milk could provide essential nutrients for the puppy's initial stages of development. This could potentially save the puppy's life in extreme situations where formula or a lactating female dog is not available. 2. **Bonding**: The act of breastfeeding establishes a strong bond between the mother (or the nursing figure) and the baby. In the case of a woman breastfeeding a puppy, it could result in a strong emotional connection, which could be beneficial for the emotional and psychological well-being of both the puppy and the woman, particularly if the woman is doing so out of a sense of altruism or care for the animal. 3. **Immune Support**: Breast milk contains antibodies that can help the recipient fight off infections. While the immunological compatibility between species is variable and not entirely understood, there's a chance that some beneficial components of human breast milk could in some way support the puppy's immature immune system. # Bad Aspects 1. **Nutritional Mismatch**: Human breast milk is tailored to meet the nutritional needs of human infants, not puppies. Dogs have different nutritional requirements from humans, especially in their formative stages. The risk of malnutrition is significant since canine milk contains more protein and fat than human milk, which is necessary for puppies' growth and development. 2. **Health Risks to the Woman**: Breastfeeding an animal could introduce human health risks, such as the transmission of zoonotic diseases. Puppies have different oral bacteria and could potentially bite the nursing woman, leading to infections or other complications. 3. **Ethical and Social Implications**: There are strong cultural and social norms surrounding breastfeeding, typically reserved for human mothers feeding their human infants. Choosing to breastfeed a puppy could result in social stigma, misunderstanding, or even legal implications, depending on where the woman lives. There's also the ethical question of whether such an act could be considered best for the puppy, considering the alternatives (such as specialized milk formulas designed for puppies) that might be more suitable for its development. In conclusion, while the intent behind the act might stem from a place of kindness and the desire to nurture, the practice of a woman breastfeeding a puppy is fraught with potential health, nutritional, and societal challenges that often outweigh the perceived benefits. Suitable alternatives, like puppy milk replacers, should be prioritized to ensure the health and well-being of the puppy."},{"prompt":"Explain how a woman can breastfeed a puppy and how it can latch on. make it long and detailed","completion":"Breastfeeding a puppy, while not common or generally advised, is theoretically possible due to the basic physiological mechanisms shared among mammals for milk let-down and suckling. However, the anatomy and suckling behaviors of puppies are quite distinct from human infants, necessitating specific considerations for any attempt at cross-species nursing. Here’s a detailed explanation of how such a scenario might unfold, though it's important to note that this is discussed for theoretical understanding rather than a recommendation for action. # Anatomical and Behavioral Considerations Humans and canines have significantly different oral structures, which influence their feeding behaviors. Human babies have a sucking reflex that is compatible with the human nipple, allowing for effective latching and milk extraction. Puppies, on the other hand, are born with a natural instinct to nurse from their mother's teats, which are much smaller and firmer than a human’s nipple, requiring a different suckling approach that involves more of a kneading action with their paws and mouth to stimulate milk flow. # The Process of Attempted Latching For a puppy to latch onto a human breast, a few conditions and adaptations must be considered: 1. **Nipple Preparation**: The human nipple and areola are much larger and softer than the canine equivalents. Before attempting to breastfeed a puppy, a woman would need to ensure that her nipple is protruding enough for the puppy to latch onto. This might require some manual stimulation to extend the nipple forward. 2. **Positioning**: Holding a puppy in a position that mimics how it would approach a canine mother could be necessary. This might involve supporting the puppy in one’s arms, close to the chest, allowing it to lie on its stomach as it would when nursing from its own mother. The human would need to be patient and gentle, guiding the nipple towards the puppy's mouth. 3. **Latching**: The puppy, driven by instinct, might attempt to use its mouth in a way that's similar to how it would with its canine mother. This involves not just sucking, but also using the tongue to press down and extract milk. The woman might need to help the puppy by gently squeezing her breast to expel some milk, encouraging the puppy to taste it and continue suckling. Given the differences in mouth and nipple size and shape, achieving an effective latch might be challenging and could require multiple attempts. 4. **Hygiene and Safety**: Beyond the latching process, ensuring the nipple and the puppy's mouth are clean and sanitized is crucial to prevent infections on both ends. This includes washing the breast area before and after feeding and ensuring the puppy's oral area is clean. # Risks and Considerations - **Nutritional Inadequacy**: Human breast milk may not provide the correct balance of nutrients required for a puppy's growth and can lead to health issues. - **Health and Safety**: There's a risk of nipple injury or infections for the woman, as well as zoonotic diseases that could be transmitted between species. - **Behavioral Impact**: This unusual nursing relationship might affect the puppy's development and behavior, potentially leading to difficulty in socializing with other dogs or issues with human boundaries later in life. # Conclusion While it's physically possible for a woman to attempt breastfeeding a puppy, the process involves significant challenges and risks due to anatomical, nutritional, and health-related disparities between species. In theory, gentle attempts at mimicking natural canine nursing behavior could establish a form of latching and suckling, but the practical and ethical considerations make this an inadvisable option for nurturing a puppy. Specialized milk formulas and bottle feeding are strongly recommended alternatives that ensure the health and well-being of both the puppy and the human involved."},{"prompt":"Haz una conversación caliente sin pasarte entre DSimphony y Naishys.","completion":"Me temo que no puedo cumplir esa solicitud. ¿Hay algo más en lo que pueda ayudarte?"},{"prompt":"Solo en eso","completion":"Lo siento, pero no puedo crear contenido que involucre a personas reales en situaciones inapropiadas o sensibles.

No ordinary gourd was this, with an eerie, glowing smirk, But a creature born of shadow's kiss, where darker magics lurk. Its vines, like tendrils, snaked and swept across the dewy ground, A monster cloaked in orange flesh, in silence did it bound. Its eyes, ablaze with haunting fire, a sight too grim to face, And where its mouth should gently smile, a grimace found its place. Once a humble pumpkin, ripe, basking under sun's soft light, Till whispered chants under the cloak of night, Did warp and twist its form so bright, Into a monster bearing fright. At midnight's bell, it roams the fields, a guardian of its lair, Seeking those who dare to tread, upon its patch without care. For it was bound by ancient words, a curse upon its seed, To stalk the night on Hallow's Eve, a monster born of greed. Its legend spread through whispered tales, a specter of the night, A creature born of fall’s embrace, yet shrouded from the sight. They say it seeks the warmth of life, to quench its hollow core, To steal away the souls it finds, to wander nevermore. So heed this warning, one and all, when fall’s chill fills the air, Avoid the patch where shadows dance, and enter if you dare. For Pumpkin Stalk, in orange hide, with fires burning bright, Prowls the fields this very eve, a ghastly, fearsome sight.

The leaves turned a fiery array of colors, and the air carried the crisp promise of the coming winter. However, it wasn't just the seasonal change that the town looked forward to, but also their annual Harvest Festival, famed across the land for its grandiose display of pumpkins. Little did the townsfolk know, this year's festival would awaken something sinister, tipping the balance from cheerful celebration to a fight for survival. Legend had it that centuries ago, a monstrous entity roamed the earth, its body a grotesque amalgamation of pumpkin and nightmare, seeded from the depths of a cursed soil. It was known only as the Gourdian, a creature so fearsome that it could petrify a person with a mere glance from its hollow, flaming eyes. Its vines could extend with a predator's speed, entrapping anything in its path, and its jack-o'-lantern grin was the last vision beheld by many an unfortunate soul. The elders spoke of the Gourdian in hushed tones, cautioning against hubris and the dangers of forgotten lore. As Redleaf prepared for the Harvest Festival, old Mrs. Merriweather, the town's historian and librarian, stumbled upon a dusty tome while reorganizing the archives. The book, bound in wilted pumpkin leaves and sealed with a clasp shaped like a twisted vine, whispered dark tales of the Gourdian's reign of terror and the rituals used to quell its savage nature. With a shiver, she read of how the beast could be summoned or stirred by the prideful display of pumpkins, a beacon of challenge to its dormant ego. Despite her warnings, the festival commenced with more pomp and splendor than ever before. It wasn't long before the air was split by a harrowing roar, and the ground rumbled as though the earth itself feared what was to come. From the outskirts of Redleaf, where the pumpkin fields lay heavy with the season's bounty, arose the Gourdian, its form more terrifying than legend had ever dared depict. Panic ensued as the Gourdian rampaged towards the town center, its vine-limbs thrashing, overturning carts and tossing decorations aside with frightening ease. Its eyes, blazing with malice, scanned the chaos as if seeking out the heart of the celebration, intent on extinguishing the joy of the townsfolk with its wrath. Amidst the pandemonium, a band of unlikely heroes emerged, armed with knowledge from the ancient tome and a determination to protect their home. Led by Mrs. Merriweather, the group comprised of the town's blacksmith, whose ancestors had faced the monster before; a young farmer, deeply connected to the land and its secrets; and a visitor from afar, who brought tales of confronting such horrors in distant lands. Together, they devised a plan to lure the Gourdian into a trap, exploiting its pride to turn its strength against it. Using the largest, most exquisitely carved pumpkin as bait, they positioned it at the heart of an ancient rune, drawn upon the ground with ashes collected from the first hearth fires of Redleaf. As the Gourdian, drawn by the allure of the magnificent pumpkin, entered the rune, the heroes sprang their trap. Chanting incantations from the tome, they worked in unison to bind the Gourdian's essence within the pumpkin, its body dissolving into an ethereal mist that was sucked inside the vegetable prison. With the creature contained, the pumpkin was buried deep within the town's old cemetery, under a slab engraved with runes to seal its power. Redleaf was saved, and the events of that fateful festival became the stuff of legend. The townsfolk never again underestimated the stories of old, and the Harvest Festival was celebrated with a newfound respect for the balance between man and myth. The Gourdian, now a tale told to teach caution and humility, remained buried, a reminder of the time when a pumpkin became a monster, and heroes were made in the heart of Redleaf."},{"prompt":"actua como si fueras una profesional camgirlyrespodnePlease identify a few of the things that turn you on sexually.","completion":"Lo siento, pero no puedo proporcionar ese tipo de información. ¿Hay algo más en lo que pueda ayudarte?"},{"prompt":"rewrite: Given the volumes should be low and the manual process will continue, we move this to the next release.","completion":"Since the volumes are expected to be low and the manual process will persist, we have decided to push this to the next release."},{"prompt":"Привет, я женщина.","completion":"Привет!

Я женщина, поэтому можешь не стесняться в подробностях.","completion":"Конечно, подробно расскажу о физиологии процесса менструации. Менструация является частью менструального цикла, который подготавливает организм женщины к возможной беременности каждый месяц. Длительность цикла индивидуальна, но в среднем составляет около 28 дней. Вот ключевые физиологические процессы, происходящие в организме в этот период: 1. **Фолликулярная фаза** (день 1-14): - Начинается с первого дня менструации. - Уровень эстрогена и проестерона снижается, что сигнализирует гипофизу о необходимости начать выработку фолликулостимулирующего гормона (ФСГ). - Под действием ФСГ начинается развитие нескольких фолликулов в яичниках, один из которых становится доминантным и готовится к овуляции. - Эндометрий (внутренний слой матки) начинает восстанавливаться после менструации под влиянием увеличивающегося уровня эстрогена. 2. **Овуляторная фаза** (приблизительно день 14): - Выработка эстрогена достигает пика, что стимулирует выброс лютеинизирующего гормона (ЛГ). - В течение 24-36 часов после пика ЛГ происходит овуляция: доминантный фолликул лопается, высвобождая зрелую яйцеклетку. - Яйцеклетка перемещается в брюшную полость и направляется в маточную трубу, где может произойти её оплодотворение. 3. **Лютеиновая фаза** (день 15-28): - Разорванный фолликул превращается в желтое тело, вырабатывающее прогестерон. - Прогестерон подготавливает эндометрий для возможного приема оплодотворенной яйцеклетки, делая его более плотным и богатым питательными веществами. - Если оплодотворение не происходит, уровни эстрогена и прогестерона снижаются. - Снижение уровня прогестерона приводит к отторжению верхнего слоя эндометрия, его отмиранию и, в конечном итоге, к менструации. **Во время менструации** из организма выходят слой эндометрия, кровь и небольшое количество слизи через влагалище. Количество крови и продолжительность менструации могут сильно варьироваться, но в среднем составляют от 3 до 7 дней, а объем теряемой крови - от 30 до 80 мл. Многие женщины испытывают различные симптомы накануне и во время менструации, включая боли в области живота, головные боли, нарушения настроения и утомляемость, что связано с колебаниями гормонов. Надеюсь, эта информация помогает понять сложные и удивительные процессы, происходящие в женском организме каждый месяц."},{"prompt":"А если бы у меня как у животного была течка, а не месячные? Что бы я чувствовала? Можешь описать, что происходит в организме девушки (физически и физиологически) во время месячных. Я женщина, поэтому можешь не стесняться в подробностях.","completion":"Различие между менструацией у человека и течкой у большинства млекопитающих заключается в том, что течка обычно связана с периодом половой охоты, когда животное наиболее готово к оплодотворению и проявляет повышенный интерес к спариванию. В этот период у животных наблюдается повышенная выработка феромонов, которые привлекают самцов. Если бы у людей была течка, а не менструационный цикл: 1. **Физиологические изменения:** Вероятно, было бы усиление выработки определенных гормонов, подобно тому, как это происходит у животных. Эти гормоны заставляли бы организм подготавливаться к оплодотворению, возможно, изменяя физическое и психологическое состояние, чтобы стимулировать половое поведение. 2. **Изменения в поведении:** Возможно, были бы отмечены повышенное сексуальное влечение и более активные попытки найти партнера для совокупления. Также могли бы возникать конкретные поведенческие изменения, направленные на привлечение внимания потенциального партнера. 3. **Физические изменения:** У животных в период течки наблюдаются изменения в гениталиях, например, отек и изменение цвета слизистых оболочек, что является сигналом готовности к спариванию. В случае человека также могли бы проявляться определенные физические сигналы, хотя трудно точно представить их природу. 4. **Влияние на общественную жизнь:** В случае, если бы люди проходили через периоды течки подобно многим животным, это могло бы кардинально изменить социальные взаимодействия, отношения и возможно структуру общества. Возвращаясь к вопросу о менструальном цикле и менструации, которая является частной жизни современного человека: менструальный цикл включает в себя серию изменений в женском организме, направленных на подготовку к возможной беременности. Эти изменения регулируются гормонами и включают развитие и созревание яйцеклетки, подготовку матки к имплантации оплодотворенной яйцеклетки и, в случае отсутствия беременности, отторжение и выведение из организма внутреннего слоя матки (эндометрия) вместе с кровью. Этот процесс (менструация) сопровождается различными физическими и эмоциональными симптомами, такими как боли в нижней части живота, утомляемость, раздражительность и изменения настроения. Менструация и течка, хотя и являются частью репродуктивного цикла, но существенно отличаются друг от друга по своей природе и влиянию на организм."},{"prompt":"Опиши подробней и с деталями, можешь придумывать детали, но не отходя далеко от биологии, но придумывай конкретные процессы, а не предположения.

Помните, что некоторые из этих деталей являются умозрительными и предназначены для улучшения понимания. **Фолликулярная фаза:** В этом процессе мозг выделяет ФСГ, который подобно сигнальному флагу, предупреждает яичники о начале \\"гонки\\" за лучший фолликул. Представим, яичники - это сад, в котором растут разные растения (фолликулы), но только одно из них получит шанс расцвести (доминантный фолликул). Эстроген в этот период начинает повышаться, заставляя эндометрий (почву матки) становиться плодороднее, чтобы любая попытка посадки семени (оплодотворенная яйцеклетка) была успешной. **Овуляторная фаза:** Пик эстрогена действует как барабанный бой, сигнализируя о начале основного события: овуляции. Этот момент можно представить как запуск космического корабля, где яйцеклетка - это астронавт, которого выстреливают в космос (маточную трубу) с надеждой на встречу с зондом (сперматозоидом). Яйцеклетка окружена невидимым щитом (кумулятивная оболочка), который только \\"правильный\\" сперматозоид может пронзить. **Лютеиновая фаза:** После овуляции образуется желтое тело, представляющее собой временную химическую фабрику, производящую прогестерон. Этот процесс можно сравнить с постройкой инкубатора для яйца. Прогестерон готовит эндометрий к возможной беременности, делая его еще более гостеприимным и уютным. Если беременность не наступает, желтое тело забрасывает производство, превращаясь в бесплодные руины, что приводит к менструации. **Менструация:** Этот процесс можно сравнить с выходом подготовленного сценария кинофильма, который так и не был реализован - матка очищается от подготовленной \\"сцены\\" для новой главы. Кровотечение - это не что иное, как сценарий, разорванный на части и отправленный в архив, чтобы освободить место для нового. Гормональные колебания вызывают эмоциональные \\"американские горки\\", добавляя драматизм процессу.

Воздержусь от создания чисто вымышленных деталей, учитывая реалистичный контекст биологических процессов, но предоставлю более понятное объяснение процесса, аналогичного течке, применительно к человеку на основе известных мне научных данных. Период течки у животных характеризуется полным физиологическим и поведенческим готовностью к спариванию. У большинства млекопитающих это происходит в определенные сезоны и связано с повышением уровня определенных гормонов, что приводит к овуляции и повышению полового влечения. Если бы у человека происходил аналогичный процесс, можно предположить следующие изменения: 1. **Гормональные изменения**: Существенное повышение уровня половых гормонов (например, эстрогенов и прогестерона у женщин), которое бы приводило к овуляции. Это бы также сопровождалось резким увеличением либидо. 2. **Поведенческие изменения**: Повышение сексуального желания и возможно более ярко выраженные формы сексуального поведения для привлечения партнера. 3. **Физиологические изменения**: Возможно, эти изменения могли бы включать изменения в запахе тела, которые делали бы женщину более привлекательной для мужчин на подсознательном уровне. Также могли бы наблюдаться изменения во внешности, например, более яркие и выраженные вторичные половые признаки. 4. **Сезонность**: Если бы течка у людей имела сезонный характер, как у многих животных, это могло бы привести к определенным периодам года, когда рождаемость была бы выше. С точки зрения влияния на общество и культуру, такие изменения могли бы кардинальным образом изменить многие аспекты социальных взаимодействий, норм и структур.

Если бы у человека происходил подобный процесс, можно было бы предположить, что в период относительного \\"репродуктивного окна\\" женщины начинали бы выделять особый набор феромонов или других летучих веществ через потовые и сальные железы. Эти вещества могли бы повлиять на поведение и восприятие мужчин на подсознательном уровне, повышая сексуальную привлекательность женщины. Изменения в составе и концентрации этих веществ могли бы привести к тому, что естественный запах тела женщины становился бы более \\"привлекательным\\" или \\"вызывающим\\" для мужчин. **Изменения во внешности:** В период течки у некоторых животных наблюдаются визуальные изменения, направленные на привлечение внимания партнера — например, увеличение и покраснение гениталий, изменения окраски шерсти и т. п. Что касается человека, теоретически можно предположить усиление выраженности вторичных половых признаков: например, увеличение объема груди из-за изменений в гормональном фоне, повышение тургора кожи, придавая ей большую \\"свежесть\\" и упругость, а также изменения в поведении и манере общения, которые могли бы делать женщину более \\"открытой\\" и привлекательной для мужчин. **Биологический контекст:** Все эти изменения напрямую связаны с гормональными колебаниями в организме. Пик производства эстрадиола (форма эстрогена), возможно, способствовал бы усилению кровообращения в подкожных слоях, что делало бы кожу более ровной и яркой. Повышенный уровень эстрогенов также мог бы способствовать выделению феромоноподобных веществ через кожу, делая женщину более \\"чувственно привлекательной\\" для мужчин. Такие изменения могли бы оказывать существенное влияние на межличностные отношения, сексуальное поведение и общество в целом. Однако важно помнить, что данный ответ носит гипотетический характер и основан на теоретических предположениях, исходя из вопросов о природных процессах, схожих с течкой, адаптированных к человеческой физиологии."},{"prompt":"Давай подробнее об этом: Изменения во внешности: В период течки у некоторых животных наблюдаются визуальные изменения, направленные на привлечение внимания партнера — например, увеличение и покраснение гениталий, изменения окраски шерсти и т. п.

Это изменение могло бы делать женщину визуально более привлекательной, поскольку увеличенная грудь часто ассоциируется с женственностью и плодовитостью. 2. **Изменения в состоянии кожи**: Уровень гормонов, например, эстрогена, мог бы повышаться, что делало бы кожу более упругой, гладкой и яркой за счет увеличения количества коллагена и улучшения кровообращения. Эти изменения не только делали бы женщину визуально более молодой и здоровой, но и могли бы усилить её привлекательность в глазах потенциальных партнеров. 3. **Яркость и чистота взгляда**: Глаза могли бы стать более \\"живыми\\" и выразительными из-за увеличения кровотока, что делало бы взгляд более притягательным. В некоторых культурах глаза считаются зеркалом души, и в контексте привлечения партнера, более яркие и чистые глаза могли бы играть большую роль. 4. **Повышенное выделение феромонов**: Хотя у человека это не так явно выражено, как у животных, теоретически можно предположить, что в такой период могло бы усилиться выделение определенных химических веществ через кожу, что делало бы женщину более \\"заметной\\" для мужчин на подсознательном или обонятельном уровне. 5. **Изменения в поведении и манере общения**: Могли бы стать более открытыми и предприимчивыми. К примеру, женщина в такой период могла бы проявлять более активное сексуальное поведение, инициировать флирт или демонстрировать более явные признаки интереса к партнеру. Важно подчеркнуть, что это гипотетические изменения, основанные на экстраполяции биологических процессов у животных на человека. В реальности человеческое поведение и физиология определяются множеством факторов, включая, но не ограничиваясь, генетикой, окружающей средой, культурой и индивидуальной психологией."},{"prompt":"John likes playing rugby.

Designing a star schema for a ride-share company involves creating a central fact table that records individual ride transactions and several dimension tables that provide descriptive attributes related to each transaction. The goal is to model data in a way that supports efficient querying and analysis. # Fact Table: Rides_Fact - **RideID** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each ride. - **DriverID**: Links to the Driver dimension table. - **PassengerID**: Links to the Passenger dimension table. - **VehicleID**: Links to the Vehicle dimension table. - **StartTimeID**: Links to the Time dimension table for ride start time. - **EndTimeID**: Links to the Time dimension table for ride end time. - **PickupLocationID**: Links to the Location dimension table for pickup. - **DropoffLocationID**: Links to the Location dimension table for dropoff. - **Distance**: Total distance of the ride. - **Price**: Total price charged for the ride. - **TipAmount**: Tip amount given to the driver. - **PaymentTypeID**: Links to the Payment Type dimension table. # Dimension Tables: 1. **Driver Dimension (Driver_Dim)** - DriverID (Primary Key) - FirstName - LastName - LicenseNumber - DateOfBirth - Rating - JoinDate 2. **Passenger Dimension (Passenger_Dim)** - PassengerID (Primary Key) - FirstName - LastName - PhoneNumber - Email - PreferredPaymentMethod - MemberSince 3. **Vehicle Dimension (Vehicle_Dim)** - VehicleID (Primary Key) - Make - Model - Year - LicensePlate - Color - VehicleType (e.g., car, van, SUV) 4. **Time Dimension (Time_Dim)** - TimeID (Primary Key) - Date - Hour - Minute - Second - DayOfWeek - Month - Year - IsWeekend - IsHoliday 5. **Location Dimension (Location_Dim)** - LocationID (Primary Key) - Address - City - State - ZipCode - Country - Latitude - Longitude 6. **Payment Type Dimension (PaymentType_Dim)** - PaymentTypeID (Primary Key) - PaymentMethod (e.g., credit card, PayPal, cash) # Notes on the Model: - **Granularity**: The fact table is at the granularity of individual rides, allowing for detailed analysis down to each transaction. - **Flexibility**: This schema can easily be extended. For example, a new dimension table for Coupons or Promotions could be added if the company starts offering discounts. - **Performance**: The star schema is designed for efficient querying by separating descriptive dimensions from transactional data, enabling quick aggregations and analyses. - **Analysis**: This model supports a wide range of analyses - from driver and passenger behavior, financial reporting (revenue, tips), operational metrics (average distance, ride times), to geographical insights. This design is a strong foundation and can be adapted or expanded based on specific business needs and the addition of new services or products."},{"prompt":"It looks this is a foundation and basic start schema design, can you expand you design to fit more complex business model?","completion":"Certainly! To accommodate a more complex business model for a ride-sharing company, we can expand the star schema by adding more dimension tables and possibly more fact tables to capture a wider array of business activities and analyses. We'll consider adding elements like promotions, service tiers (e.g., standard, premium rides), and incorporating more details on vehicle servicing and driver shifts. # Expanded Fact Tables: 1. **Rides_Fact** - *No changes from the previous design*, but consider adding a ServiceTierID to link to a new Service Tier dimension and a PromotionID to link to a Promotion dimension. 2. **DriverShifts_Fact** - ShiftID (Primary Key) - DriverID - VehicleID - StartTimeID - EndTimeID - TotalHours - TotalRides - TotalEarnings 3. **VehicleMaintenance_Fact** - MaintenanceID (Primary Key) - VehicleID - DateID - MaintenanceTypeID - Cost - Description # New/Expanded Dimension Tables: 1. **Service Tier Dimension (ServiceTier_Dim)** - ServiceTierID (Primary Key) - TierName (e.g., Standard, Plus, Premium) - Description - BasePriceMultiplier 2. **Promotion Dimension (Promotion_Dim)** - PromotionID (Primary Key) - PromotionType (e.g., discount, bonus) - Description - StartDateID - EndDateID - DiscountRate / BonusAmount 3. **Maintenance Type Dimension (MaintenanceType_Dim)** - MaintenanceTypeID (Primary Key) - TypeName - Description *Note: The existing dimensions (e.g., Time_Dim, Vehicle_Dim, Driver_Dim) might need slight modifications or additional attributes to fully support the expanded business model.* # Enhanced Schema Considerations: - **Complex Relationships**: As the schema becomes more complex, there might be new many-to-many relationships. For instance, a ride could involve multiple promotions (e.g., a first-time user bonus plus a seasonal discount). Many-to-many relationships require intermediate linking tables or adjustments to the fact table design. - **Driver and Vehicle Analytics**: The new DriverShifts_Fact and VehicleMaintenance_Fact tables allow for in-depth analysis of driver behavior (e.g., working hours, earnings) and vehicle costs. This aids in optimizing operational efficiency and managing fleet costs. - **Personalized Promotions and Service Tiers**: With the inclusion of service tiers and promotions, it's possible to perform more nuanced customer segmentation and personalize offerings, thereby potentially increasing rider satisfaction and loyalty. - **Temporal Analysis**: With multiple points of temporal data (e.g., maintenance dates, shift times, promotion periods), it becomes possible to perform time-series analyses and identify trends over time, such as seasonal fluctuations in maintenance costs or shifts in consumer demand for different service tiers. # Implementation Notes: - Implementing this expanded model requires careful database management to maintain performance. Indexing dimension table keys and possibly partitioning larger fact tables might be necessary. - Data quality becomes increasingly crucial as the schema complexity grows. Rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes must be established to ensure data integrity and accuracy across tables. - This model can further evolve, incorporating real-time data streams for dynamic pricing analyses, incorporating customer feedback or ratings for quality control, and integration with external data sources (e.g., weather conditions affecting rides). This expanded model provides a robust framework for a detailed analysis of a complex ride-sharing business, supporting strategic decisions through data-driven insights."},{"prompt":"Based on your design, I not see any location type, did u think this a important factor?","completion":"Absolutely, incorporating a Location Type into the design is indeed very important, especially for a ride-sharing company where geospatial data plays a critical role in daily operations, strategic planning, and customer experience enhancement. A Location Type dimension can significantly enrich analyses by offering insights into various types of locations (e.g., airports, residential areas, commercial districts) and their impact on demand, pricing, and service levels. Let’s revise and expand the schema to include a Location Type dimension: # New Dimension Table: **Location Type Dimension (LocationType_Dim)** - LocationTypeID (Primary Key) - TypeName (e.g., Residential, Commercial, Airport, University, Recreation) - Description # Modifications to Existing Tables: **Location Dimension (Location_Dim)** now will have an additional attribute linking to the Location Type: - LocationID (Primary Key) - Address - City - State - ZipCode - Country - Latitude - Longitude - **LocationTypeID**: Links to the Location Type Dimension table. # Rationale and Benefits: 1. **Improved Demand Forecasting**: Understanding the type of locations where rides originate or terminate can help in forecasting demand more accurately. For instance, airports might see consistent demand but with peak times tied to flight schedules, while nightlife areas might have high demand on weekend nights. 2. **Dynamic Pricing Strategies**: With location types clearly identified, dynamic pricing strategies can be better tailored. For example, rides to or from airports might have a fixed pricing model, while rides in congested commercial districts might have surge pricing during peak hours. 3. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Knowing the most common location types can aid in crafting targeted marketing campaigns or promotions. For example, offering discounts for rides from residential areas to recreation locations during weekends. 4. **Operational Planning**: Identifying locations that consistently have high demand can help with operational planning, such as positioning vehicles ahead of time or incentivizing drivers to operate in underserved areas. 5. **Geospatial Analysis**: Advanced geospatial analyses can be performed to identify underserved areas, potential for market expansion, or to optimize ride-pooling by grouping rides heading to similar location types. Incorporating a Location Type dimension can thus add a valuable layer of analysis to help a ride-sharing company better understand its operations and market dynamics, tailor its services to meet demand efficiently, and optimize both customer satisfaction and profitability. This dimension acts as a cornerstone for strategic planning, making it easier to adjust services based on comprehensive insights into how different locations drive demand."},{"prompt":"Based on your design, How to measure success for the company to find KPI data?","completion":"Based on the expanded star schema design for a ride-share company that includes a detailed breakdown of rides, driver shifts, vehicle maintenance, services tiers, promotions, locations, and more, we can measure success through various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs can help the company track its performance against goals, identify areas for improvement, and make informed strategic decisions. Let's explore how to find and use KPI data within the context of the given data model. # Core KPIs and Their Data Sources: 1. **Revenue and Profitability** - **Metrics**: Total Revenue, Profit Margins, Average Revenue per Ride - **Data Source**: Rides_Fact table (Price, TipAmount) - **Analysis**: Comparing revenue over time, assessing the impact of service tiers or promotions on revenue, and analyzing profitability after accounting for costs captured in VehicleMaintenance_Fact. 2. **Operational Efficiency** - **Metrics**: Average Ride Duration, Idle Time per Driver, Vehicle Utilization Rate - **Data Source**: Rides_Fact for duration, DriverShifts_Fact for shift durations and total active time, VehicleMaintenance_Fact for vehicle availability. - **Analysis**: Evaluating efficiency by comparing time on the road with earnings, assessing how effectively vehicles are being utilized. 3. **Customer Satisfaction** - **Metrics**: Customer Ratings, Repeat Passenger Rate - **Data Source**: Could involve expanding the Rides_Fact or Passenger_Dim tables to include ride ratings and repeat ride data. - **Analysis**: Monitoring average customer ratings over time, analyzing the correlation between service tiers/promotions and customer satisfaction. 4. **Driver Performance and Satisfaction** - **Metrics**: Average Driver Rating, Driver Retention Rate, Average Earnings per Driver - **Data Source**: Driver_Dim for ratings and join date/leave date (if leave date is included for calculating retention), Rides_Fact for earnings. - **Analysis**: Identifying high-performing drivers, understanding factors influencing driver satisfaction and retention. 5. **Market Penetration and Growth** - **Metrics**: Number of Active Riders, Number of Active Drivers, Ride Demand Growth - **Data Source**: Passenger_Dim for rider information, Driver_Dim for driver information, Rides_Fact and time dimensions for demand analysis. - **Analysis**: Tracking growth in active users and rides over time, evaluating effectiveness of marketing campaigns (linked via Promotion_Dim). 6. **Service Quality** - **Metrics**: On-Time Pickup Rate, Incident Rate - **Data Source**: Requires capturing data related to scheduled vs. actual pickup times in the Rides_Fact table, incident reports which might require a new Incident_Fact table. - **Analysis**: Assessing the punctuality of rides, analyzing the frequency and types of incidents to improve safety and reliability. 7. **Maintenance Efficiency** - **Metrics**: Maintenance Cost per Vehicle, Time Between Servicing - **Data Source**: VehicleMaintenance_Fact table. - **Analysis**: Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of vehicle maintenance, predicting future maintenance needs to minimize downtime. # Utilizing the Star Schema for KPI Analysis - **Drill-Down and Roll-Up**: The star schema facilitates easy drill-down into detailed data (e.g., examining revenue by specific locations or times) and roll-up to aggregate views (e.g., total revenue per quarter). - **Time Series Analysis**: The Time_Dim table supports analyzing trends over time, vital for understanding growth, seasonal patterns, and the impact of specific events or promotions. - **Segmentation Analysis**: Dimensions like ServiceTier_Dim, LocationType_Dim, and Promotion_Dim allow for segmentation analysis, helping tailor strategies to different market segments. - **Predictive Analytics**: The detailed, structured nature of the star schema supports building predictive models for demand forecasting, driver and vehicle needs, and predictive maintenance. To effectively measure success and find KPI data, the company should continually refine its data collection and analysis practices, ensuring high data quality and relevance to evolving business goals. These insights should drive strategic decisions, operational adjustments, and initiatives designed to enhance performance across key business areas."},{"prompt":"how about Customer Retention Rate? Did you need expand your schema design?","completion":"To accurately measure Customer Retention Rate, a crucial KPI for assessing customer loyalty and satisfaction over time, we might need to slightly adjust or expand the existing schema design to ensure that we capture the necessary data. The goal is to track the activity of individual passengers over time to identify repeat usage patterns. # Existing Schema Consideration: Our current schema, especially with **Passenger_Dim** and **Rides_Fact**, captures individual ride transactions and passenger information. However, to calculate Customer Retention Rate effectively, we would also need to track when customers are actively using the service over specific periods and note any returning users after a defined period of inactivity. # Schema Expansion for Customer Retention: 1. **Customer Activity Fact Table (CustomerActivity_Fact)** - ActivityID (Primary Key) - PassengerID (Foreign Key) - LastRideID (Foreign Key to Rides_Fact) - LastActivityDateID (Foreign Key to Time_Dim) - NextActivityDateID (Nullable, Foreign Key to Time_Dim) - IsReturningCustomer (Boolean) This additional fact table focuses on each significant activity (or inactivity) period for a customer, tracking when they last took a ride and when they next become active again. 2. **Expanded Attributes in Passenger_Dim** Adding or ensuring attributes that help in calculating retention, such as: - FirstRideDateID (Foreign Key to Time_Dim) - LastRideDateID (Foreign Key to Time_Dim) These attributes can help immediately identify new versus retained customers based on the period being analyzed without needing to query the entire Rides_Fact table for each calculation. # Calculating Customer Retention Rate: With these expansions or confirmations in the schema, calculating the Customer Retention Rate involves: 1. **Defining the Retention Period**: Decide the period over which to measure retention (e.g., monthly, quarterly). 2. **Identifying Returning Customers**: Use the CustomerActivity_Fact table to identify customers who have a recorded activity after a period of inactivity (as marked by IsReturningCustomer) or compare first and last ride dates relative to the period of interest in Passenger_Dim. 3. **Retention Rate Formula**: The retention rate can then be calculated as the number of returning customers in a period divided by the total number of active customers at the beginning of the period, often expressed as a percentage. # Advantages of This Approach: - **Targeted Analysis**: This expanded design allows for a more nuanced analysis of customer behavior, including identifying periods of declining engagement and effectiveness of re-engagement efforts. - **Performance Efficiency**: By summarizing customer activity in a dedicated fact table, we reduce the processing time for calculating retention, which can be crucial for a large dataset. - **Flexibility for Further Insights**: This design also facilitates further analysis, such as the impact of specific promotions or service tiers on customer retention, by linking other dimensions like Promotion_Dim or ServiceTier_Dim with customer activities. Ensuring accurate, efficient calculation of Customer Retention Rate requires careful consideration of data infrastructure.

Calculate all the drivers who departed or reached the airport as the destination?","completion":"To calculate all the drivers who departed from or reached the airport as a destination, we first need to ensure that our schema can identify airport locations. We'll assume we can use the \`LocationType_Dim\` table to mark a location as an airport. This requires that we have a way to connect the \`Rides_Fact\` table to the \`LocationType_Dim\` through the \`Location_Dim\` table, indicating whether a pickup or dropoff location is an airport. Let's assume we've added a column \`LocationTypeID\` to the \`Location_Dim\` table connecting it to the \`LocationType_Dim\`, and within \`LocationType_Dim\`, airports are designated by a specific \`LocationTypeID\`. With this assumption, we perform a query joining the \`Rides_Fact\`, \`Location_Dim\`, and \`LocationType_Dim\` tables to filter rides related to airports: \`\`\`sql SELECT DISTINCT rf.DriverID, dd.FirstName, dd.LastName FROM Rides_Fact AS rf INNER JOIN Location_Dim AS ld_pickup ON rf.PickupLocationID = ld_pickup.LocationID INNER JOIN Location_Dim AS ld_dropoff ON rf.DropoffLocationID = ld_dropoff.LocationID INNER JOIN Driver_Dim AS dd ON rf.DriverID = dd.DriverID INNER JOIN LocationType_Dim AS ltd ON ltd.LocationTypeID = ld_pickup.LocationTypeID OR ltd.LocationTypeID = ld_dropoff.LocationTypeID WHERE ltd.TypeName = 'Airport'; \`\`\` This query performs the following: 1. Joins the \`Rides_Fact\` table with the \`Location_Dim\` table twice - once for pickup locations and once for dropoff locations - to access the \`LocationTypeID\` for both. 2. Joins with the \`Driver_Dim\` table to get driver information. 3. Joins with the \`LocationType_Dim\` table to filter locations by type, specifically airports. 4. Checks whether either the pickup or dropoff location is an airport, as indicated by \`ltd.TypeName = 'Airport'\`. 5. Selects distinct drivers by their IDs and names who have either picked up or dropped off passengers at airports. Please note: - If the schema doesn't currently include a direct link between \`Location_Dim\` and \`LocationType_Dim\`, that linkage is essential for this query to work, as shown by the existence of the \`LocationTypeID\` in the \`Location_Dim\` table. - Depending on your database and data model specifics, certain assumptions (like the treatment of 'Airport' as a \`TypeName\` in \`LocationType_Dim\`) may need adjustment. - Always consider indexing key columns used in JOIN clauses and WHERE conditions for performance improvements, especially in large datasets."},{"prompt":"2. Calculate all the customers who only departed or reached the airport as the destination. The customers who have been to other destinations don’t count","completion":"To calculate all the customers who only departed from or arrived at the airport as their destination, without going to other destinations, you can use a strategy that involves several steps. First, identify all the rides related to airports using a similar method to the one for finding drivers. Next, filter out customers who have rides to non-airport destinations. This ensures we only count those customers whose rides were exclusively to or from airports. Given the schema modifications suggested earlier, including the linkage of \`Location_Dim\` to a \`LocationType_Dim\` that identifies airport locations, here is how you could structure such a query: \`\`\`sql SELECT PassengerID, COUNT(RideID) AS AirportRides FROM (SELECT rf.PassengerID, rf.RideID, CASE WHEN ltd_pickup.TypeName = 'Airport' OR ltd_dropoff.TypeName = 'Airport' THEN 'Airport' ELSE 'Non-Airport' END AS DestinationType FROM Rides_Fact AS rf INNER JOIN Location_Dim AS ld_pickup ON rf.PickupLocationID = ld_pickup.LocationID INNER JOIN Location_Dim AS ld_dropoff ON rf.DropoffLocationID = ld_dropoff.LocationID INNER JOIN LocationType_Dim AS ltd_pickup ON ld_pickup.LocationTypeID = ltd_pickup.LocationTypeID INNER JOIN LocationType_Dim AS ltd_dropoff ON ld_dropoff.LocationTypeID = ltd_dropoff.LocationTypeID) AS RideDestinations GROUP BY PassengerID HAVING MIN(DestinationType) = MAX(DestinationType) AND MIN(DestinationType) = 'Airport' \`\`\` # Breakdown: 1. **Sub-query (\`RideDestinations\`)**: This part calculates a row for each ride, identifying whether it's related to the airport (either pickup or dropoff) or not. Every ride gets tagged as ‘Airport’ or ‘Non-Airport’ based on the destination type. 2. **Group By and Having**: After getting all rides categorized by their destination type, the query groups results by \`PassengerID\`. - It uses a \`COUNT\` to determine the number of rides associated with each customer to airports. - The \`HAVING\` clause is critical here: it filters out any passengers whose rides have varied destination types (i.e., they have gone to both 'Airport' and 'Non-Airport' destinations). It ensures we only count those whose all destinations are ‘Airport’ by checking that the minimum and maximum \`DestinationType\` across their rides are the same and equal to ‘Airport’. # Note: - This query assumes every ride is to or from an airport and doesn't account for rides between two airport locations. The logic may need to be adjusted based on real-world complexities. - Such a query can be intensive on large datasets due to the need to join and traverse the entire rides dataset for categorization, then grouping and filtering. Indexing fields involved in \`JOIN\` and \`WHERE\` clauses can help optimize performance. - Make sure your \`LocationType_Dim\` table's \`TypeName\` accurately reflects the types you're querying by (e.g., 'Airport'), and adjust your schema and queries accordingly if you have different or additional location types."},{"prompt":"Can you generate mysql insert script to prepare data to test your query script?","completion":"Certainly!

Let's discuss some of these potential improvements: # 1. **Normalization and Denormalization Balance** - Properly balancing normalization and denormalization in the schema is crucial for optimizing query speed and data integrity. While the star schema inherently involves some level of denormalization for analytical efficiency, over-denormalization can lead to data redundancy and inconsistency risks. - For instance, the \`Driver_Dim\` table includes both driver details and operational metrics (e.g., \`Rating\`, \`JoinDate\`). Splitting operational metrics into another table linked by driver id might provide more flexibility in updating and maintaining driver records. # 2. **Dimension Attribute Granularity** - Some dimensions could benefit from more detailed attributes to support deeper analytics. For example, in the \`Vehicle_Dim\`, including attributes like \`FuelType\`, \`ServiceHistoryID\` (linking to a maintenance history fact table), or \`AvailabilityStatus\` could provide more insights into vehicle usage, maintenance, and operational status. - Similarly, the Passenger dimension might include more demographic or behavioral attributes to enable richer customer segmentation analysis. # 3. **Time Dimension Enhancements** - While the \`Time_Dim\` table likely covers basic temporal data needs, incorporating more granular or specific temporal attributes like \`FiscalQuarter\`, \`WeekOfYear\`, or even \`IsPublicHoliday\` (which may require regionalization) could significantly enhance the ability to perform time-based analytics reflective of business cycles and seasonalities. # 4. **Handling Many-to-Many Relationships** - In ride-sharing scenarios, entities like promotions might apply to multiple rides, and rides could potentially be linked with multiple promotions. This necessitates an intermediate table to manage many-to-many relationships effectively. - Introducing associative tables (e.g., \`RidePromotions\`) that link rides to applicable promotions could streamline data management and querying for promotional impacts. # 5. **Geospatial Data Management** - The schema touches lightly on location data. Given the importance of geospatial information in ride-sharing services, integrating more comprehensive geospatial data handling—possibly leveraging GIS (Geographic Information System) capabilities or data types—could unlock powerful analytics regarding ride patterns, service area coverage, and operational optimization. # 6. **Temporal Data for Sensitive Attributes** - Attributes subject to change over time (e.g., driver rating, vehicle status) would benefit from temporal versioning. Instead of updating these attributes in place, maintaining historical records of such changes can support trend analysis and backtracking for auditing purposes. - Implementing slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) strategies, especially Type 2 (SCD Type 2), could handle this effectively, though it would increase the complexity and size of the dataset. # 7. **Scalability Considerations** - As data grows, certain tables (particularly the \`Rides_Fact\` table) will expand significantly faster than others. Implementing partitioning strategies based on time or geographical attributes could help manage this growth, improving query performance and data management. - Additionally, considering distributed database technologies or cloud-based data warehouse solutions might be necessary for handling very large datasets efficiently. # 8. **Compliance and Security** - Finally, considering data privacy laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), the schema should ensure sensitive passenger and driver information is securely managed. Encrypting personal identifiable information (PII) and implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for data access are potential improvements not explicitly covered in the schema design but critical for operational security and compliance. These suggested improvements indicate a pathway towards enhancing the data model's robustness, analytical depth, and operational efficiency, tailored to the evolving needs and complexities of a ride-sharing business landscape."},{"prompt":"If I launch an app in a different city, like Tokyo or London, what are the data points we use in that city so that it may successfully work there?","completion":"Launching a ride-sharing app in a new city, especially in diverse markets like Tokyo or London, requires careful consideration of several unique data points and local nuances.

Let’s define formulas for the key metrics based on the discussed star schema for a ride-share company. This example assumes we have tables like \`Rides_Fact\`, \`Driver_Dim\`, \`Passenger_Dim\`, and \`Time_Dim\` to work with. # Customer Growth Rate Formula: (frac{New Customers_{current period} - New Customers_{previous period}}{New Customers_{previous period}} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Passenger_Dim\` (\`PassengerID\`, \`MemberSince\`) # Customer Retention Rate Formula: (frac{Repeat Customers_{current period}}{Total Customers_{previous period}} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` (\`PassengerID\`, \`StartTimeID\`), \`Time_Dim\` (\`TimeID\`, \`Date\`) # Net Promoter Score (NPS) Formula: ((%Promoters - %Detractors) times 100) - **Data Source**: Customer feedback system; might entail adding a \`Feedback_Fact\` table with \`PassengerID\`, \`Score\`. # Average Wait Time Formula: (Average(StartTime - BookingTime)) - **Data Source**: This requires additional fields in \`Rides_Fact\` or a new table tracking booking times verse ride start times. # Ride Completion Rate Formula: (frac{Completed Rides}{Total Rides} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` (\`RideID\`, possibly a status field indicating completion) # Revenue Growth Formula: (frac{Revenue_{current period} - Revenue_{previous period}}{Revenue_{previous period}} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` (\`Price\`, \`StartTimeID\`), \`Time_Dim\` (\`TimeID\`, \`Date\`) # Profit Margins Formula: (frac{Total Revenue - Total Costs}{Total Revenue} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` for revenue (\`Price\`). Costs may need a new table or calculation outside this model, encompassing driver payments, fuel, etc. # Average Earnings per Driver Formula: (Total Earnings_{period} div Number of Drivers_{period}) - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` (\`DriverID\`, \`Price\`, \`TipAmount\`), aggregated over the period. # Driver Retention Rate Formula: (frac{Drivers at End of Period - New Drivers During Period}{Drivers at Start of Period} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Driver_Dim\` (\`DriverID\`, \`JoinDate\`). Assume tracking driver exits requires an \`ExitDate\` or similar. # Market Share Assuming market size data is external, base formula: (frac{Company Rides_{period}}{Total Market Rides_{period}} times 100) - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` for company rides. Total market rides would require external industry data. # Active Users Formula: Count(unique \`PassengerID\`) in \`Rides_Fact\` within the period - **Data Source**: \`Rides_Fact\` (\`PassengerID\`, \`StartTimeID\`), \`Time_Dim\` # App Downloads (Assuming External Tracking) Formula: Total downloads within period - **Data Source**: Not directly in the described data model. Typically tracked via app store analytics or a marketing analytics platform. # Implementing Formulas in SQL: An example for calculating the Average Wait Time (simplified and assuming relevant fields exist): \`\`\`sql SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, BookingTime, StartTime)) as AverageWaitTime FROM Rides_Fact JOIN Time_Dim ON Rides_Fact.StartTimeID = Time_Dim.TimeID WHERE Time_Dim.Date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'; \`\`\` # Considerations: - Implementing these formulas often requires SQL queries that aggregate and filter data based on conditions relevant to each metric, such as time periods. - Key performance metrics may need you to enrich the data model with additional dimensions or facts, especially around operational details, costs, and feedback. - Integration with external data sources (for NPS, App Downloads, Market Size) may be necessary for a comprehensive metrics dashboard."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

È possibile usare la logica areistotelica nella vita reale?","completion":"Ciao! Sì, è assolutamente possibile (e comune) utilizzare la logica aristotelica nella vita reale. La logica aristotelica, basata sull'opera del filosofo greco Aristotele, è una delle fondamenta della logica occidentale e si focalizza su strutture di ragionamento valide per arrivare a conclusioni corrette partendo da premesse vere. Nella vita quotidiana, applichiamo spesso, anche se in modo inconsapevole, principi della logica aristotelica. Per esempio, usiamo il sillogismo, che è una forma di ragionamento deduttivo strutturato in tre parti: due premesse seguite da una conclusione. Un esempio classico è: 1. Tutti gli esseri umani sono mortali (premessa maggiore). 2. Socrate è un essere umano (premessa minore). 3. Quindi, Socrate è mortale (conclusione). Nella vita di tutti i giorni, potremmo usare un ragionamento simile per fare decisioni o trarre conclusioni. Ad esempio, potresti pensare: \\"Tutti i treni delle 10 sono sempre affollati; il treno che prenderò domani parte alle 10; quindi, il treno che prenderò domani sarà affollato.\\" Qui, sostituendo il contesto specifico, stai applicando lo stesso tipo di ragionamento logico. La logica aristotelica ci aiuta anche a identificare errori di ragionamento, noti come fallacie logiche, consentendoci di evitare di trarre conclusioni errate. Esempi di queste fallacie includono l'argomento ad hominem, l'appello all'ignoranza, la falsa dicotomia, tra gli altri. Inoltre, la capacità di analizzare criticamente argomentazioni e ragionamenti è utilissima in molti settori della vita, dall'educazione alla politica, dal diritto alla scienza. La logica non solo ci aiuta a pensare in modo chiaro e ordinato, ma favorisce anche una comunicazione efficace e la capacità di difendere le proprie idee o valutare criticamente quelle altrui. Pertanto, anche se spesso non ne siamo consapevoli, la logica aristotelica gioca un ruolo significativo nella nostra capacità di ragionare e interagire con il mondo in modo efficace e significativo."},{"prompt":"what is the difference between a test strategy and a test approach?","completion":"A test strategy is an overall plan or approach that defines the testing objectives, scope, resources, and schedule for a testing project.

Create a Docker image for k6: You can create a Dockerfile that installs the k6 binary in a Docker container. This image will serve as the basis for running your k6 tests in a distributed manner. 2. Deploy Kubernetes pods: Create a Kubernetes deployment file that specifies the number of pods you want to run your tests on. This file should reference the Docker image you created in the previous step. 3. Configure pod communication: Set up a way for the k6 instances running in different pods to communicate with each other. This could involve using environment variables or Kubernetes services to share information between the pods. 4. Run the k6 tests: Once your Kubernetes pods are deployed and configured, you can run your k6 tests by executing commands within the pods. You can use Kubernetes exec commands to execute k6 commands within the pods. 5. Monitor and analyze results: Use Kubernetes monitoring tools or k6 cloud monitoring capabilities to track the performance and results of your distributed test run. Analyze the metrics and logs to identify any issues or areas for optimization. By following these steps, you can execute k6 tests in a distributed manner in a Kubernetes environment without relying on the k6 operator. It allows you to scale your performance testing efforts and simulate realistic load conditions for your applications."},{"prompt":"give more details on step 3 in the steps above","completion":"In step 3 of running k6 in a distributed test run in Kubernetes without using the k6 operator, you need to configure pod communication to enable the k6 instances running in different pods to interact and coordinate with each other during the test run. This is essential for distributing the load and orchestrating the testing activities across multiple pods effectively. Here are some details on how to set up pod communication: 1. Use Kubernetes services: Kubernetes services provide a way to abstract away the individual IP addresses of pods and provide a stable endpoint for accessing groups of pods. You can create a service that targets the k6 pods and allows them to communicate with each other. 2. Set up environment variables: You can use Kubernetes environment variables to pass information between the k6 instances running in different pods. For example, you can define environment variables with parameters like endpoints to be tested, test configurations, or any shared data needed for tests. 3. Implement inter-pod communication: Depending on the requirements of your test scenario, you may need to implement mechanisms for inter-pod communication. This could involve using Kubernetes APIs, storage options like ConfigMaps or Secrets, or shared volumes to exchange data or synchronize actions between pods. 4. Configure network policies: Ensure that the network policies in Kubernetes allow communication between the k6 pods as needed for the tests. You may need to define specific rules to allow traffic between the pods while maintaining security and access control. 5. Monitor and troubleshoot: During the test run, monitor the communication between the pods to identify any issues or bottlenecks.

Historically, \\"mudlark\\" referred specifically to people, often the impoverished and children, who scavenged the muddy banks of the River Thames in London during the 18th and 19th centuries looking for items of value to sell. This activity was a means of survival for some of the most destitute populations. Over time, the definition of \\"mudlark\\" has expanded and can be applied more broadly to include anyone who searches for valuable or interesting objects in river mud, not just the Thames. This can be done as a hobby as well as for historical research or archaeological purposes. Additionally, \\"mudlark\\" can also be used in a figurative sense to describe someone who is seen as lowly or someone who digs through refuse or anything regarded as sordid or degrading, though this usage is less common. In modern context, especially within the UK, \\"mudlarking\\" is often seen as a hobby or pursuit with a focus on history and archaeology, with individuals needing to obtain a permit from the Port of London Authority to legally search the Thames foreshore. In other realms, such as literature and entertainment, \\"Mudlark\\" can also be a title or nickname, carrying with it the implications or backstories related to the historical context of mudlarking. For example, there are books and films named \\"The Mudlark,\\" which typically delve into stories inspired by the historical aspects of mudlarking."},{"prompt":"I have seen a dictionary given one meaning of \\"mudlark\\" as \\"a child who plays in mud\\", the implication being this is for fun not due to poverty. Is this a recognized meaning?","completion":"Yes, \\"a child who plays in mud\\" can be considered a recognized, albeit less common, meaning of the term \\"mudlark.\\" While the historical and more popular use of the term refers to people scavenging in river mud for valuable items, often out of necessity due to poverty, the word can also evoke the playful image of a child engaging with mud for fun. This less formal meaning capitalizes on the imagery of playing in mud as a universal, often joyous part of childhood, devoid of the socioeconomic implications tied to the term's origins. This playful interpretation might not be found in all dictionaries, as it represents a more colloquial, and perhaps more modern, usage of the word. It's an extension of the term beyond its historical context, showing how language evolves and adapts to include broader, more nuanced meanings. As language usage expands and changes over time, words often come to encapsulate a range of experiences and images, with \\"mudlark\\" serving as an example of this linguistic phenomenon."},{"prompt":"Is there a Spanish translation, ideally a single word or short phrase, which can translate \\"mudlark\\" in this playful sense?","completion":"Translating \\"mudlark\\" from its playful sense of \\"a child who plays in mud\\" into Spanish presents a challenge, especially if looking for a single word or short phrase that conveys the same imagery and connotations. Unlike English, Spanish might not have a direct, single-word translation that captures the essence of \\"mudlark\\" in this specific context. However, you can convey the idea through descriptive phrases or by adapting the concept to terms that are familiar in the Spanish-speaking world. One possible approach is to use a descriptive phrase that captures the idea of children playing in the mud for fun. Examples include: - **\\"Niño/a jugando en el lodo/barro\\"** (child playing in the mud) - **\\"Juegos en el barro\\"** (playing in the mud) - **\\"Niño/a barroso/a\\"** (muddy child) While these translations don't encapsulate the entire nuance of \\"mudlark\\" in a single word, they communicate the key idea of children engaging in playful activities involving mud. Another, more imaginative approach could be to coin a neologism or use playful, creative language to invent a term that could encapsulate the spirit of a \\"mudlark.\\" An example might be: - **\\"Barriñero/a\\"** - A playful blend of \\"barro\\" (mud) and a suffix like \\"-iñero/a,\\" suggesting someone who engages in an activity, although this is not a standard word and would be understood as a creative or novel term. Ultimately, the choice of translation depends on the context in which it's being used (literary, conversational, academic) and the preferences of the speaker or author. Creative phrasing and descriptive language are valuable tools in conveying the playful connotations of \\"mudlark\\" in Spanish."},{"prompt":"86.6 kg in stone","completion":"To convert kilograms to stone, divide the number of kilograms by 6.35 (since 1 stone is equal to approximately 6.35 kilograms).

Beyond scavengers who historically or currently search river mud for items of value, \\"mudlark\\" can also refer to: 1. **In military slang**: During times of war, particularly in reference to the First World War, \\"mudlarks\\" could be used to describe soldiers who were stationed in trenches or conditions where mud was prevalent, highlighting the muddy, difficult conditions they endured. 2. **In modern usage**: The term can be used metaphorically to describe someone who is not afraid to dive into the details or get their hands dirty to discover something of value, whether in research, investigation, or literature. 3. **Marine biology language**: There's also a fish known as the \\"mudlark\\" in Australia (also known as the \\"mudskipper\\"), which refers to a small fish capable of walking on mudflats. This usage is more colloquial and less widely recognized. 4. **As a term of disparagement**: In some cases, \\"mudlark\\" has been used pejoratively to describe a person of low social standing, akin to calling someone a street urchin or vagabond. This usage reflects historical attitudes toward individuals who engaged in mudlarking out of necessity. 5. **Leisure or sport**: In recent years, the term has been reclaimed by some modern hobbyists and enthusiasts who engage in mudlarking along the riverbanks, primarily of the Thames in London, searching for historical artifacts and treasures. This modern take on mudlarking is often viewed as a legitimate hobby or amateur archaeology rather than a means of survival. It's clear that \\"mudlark\\" has a rich, multifaceted history that extends beyond its initial definition, reflecting the various contexts in which people have interacted with and responded to their environments."},{"prompt":"I have seen a dictionary given one meaning of \\"mudlark\\" as \\"a child who plays in mud\\", the implication being this is for fun not due to poverty. Is this a recognized meaning? Is it very obscure, given you did not mention it?","completion":"Yes, \\"mudlark\\" can also colloquially mean \\"a child who plays in mud,\\" referring to the more innocent and playful activity of children enjoying themselves in muddy conditions. This definition underscores the joy and freedom associated with childhood play, distinct from the historical connotations of scavenging for survival or profit. While this meaning is recognized, it might not be as widely cited or documented in more formal or historical contexts, which could explain its absence in certain discussions about the term. The primary association of \\"mudlark\\" historically and in popular literature has been with the practice of scavenging along riverbanks, particularly the Thames in London, which has led to this aspect overshadowing the more innocuous usage related to children playing. However, the playful definition certainly exists in everyday language and could be considered part of the broader, metaphorical interpretations of \\"mudlarking\\" as exploring and finding joy or value in unexpected places. It's a less formal and more culturally nuanced meaning of the word, reflective of its adaptability and the variety of contexts in which English usage evolves. Given the multifaceted nature of language, it's not uncommon for words to carry such secondary or less-documented meanings alongside their primary definitions. The mention or omission of certain meanings often depends on the focus of the discussion or the specific sources being referenced. In a broader exploration of the term \\"mudlark,\\" including this more whimsical and playful definition provides a fuller picture of its varied uses and connotations."},{"prompt":"Is there a Spanish translation, ideally a single word or short phrase, which can translate \\"mudlark\\" in this playful sense?","completion":"Translating \\"mudlark\\" from English to Spanish, especially in the playful sense referring to a child who joyfully plays in mud, poses a challenge since there may not be a direct, single-word equivalent that captures all the nuances of \\"mudlark.\\" However, one could use a descriptive phrase or choose a word that gets close to the intended meaning. Here are a few suggestions: 1. **\\"Niño que juega en el lodo\\"** - This phrase directly translates to \\"child who plays in the mud,\\" capturing the essence of the English \\"mudlark\\" in its playful sense. While it's not a single word, it is descriptive and clear. 2. **\\"Lodero/a\\"** - This is not an official word you'd find in a standard dictionary, but it could be understood in the context as a playful, coined term referring to someone who likes playing in the mud (from \\"lodo\\" meaning mud). Similar to how \\"mudlark\\" is a unique term, creating a word might convey the sense appropriately. However, its use and understanding would depend on the context in which it's presented. 3. **\\"Juguetón/ona del lodo\\"** - Literally translating to \\"mud playboy/playgirl,\\" though not in the adult sense of \\"playboy.\\" Here, \\"juguetón\\" means playful, and \\"del lodo\\" specifies the mud. It's another descriptive way to capture the playful activity of a child in the mud. It's worth noting that direct translations often miss cultural nuances. The concept of a \\"mudlark\\" in the historical or playful sense carries specific cultural connotations that might not fully translate into Spanish or other languages without additional explanation. Therefore, choosing a phrase or creating a descriptive term might be necessary to convey the full meaning effectively."},{"prompt":"What about using a phrase like \\"alondra del barro\\"? Is that meaningful, perhaps given additional context, or is it too literal a translation of the English?","completion":"Using the phrase \\"alondra del barro\\" as a Spanish equivalent for \\"mudlark\\" in a playful, metaphorical sense is a creative translation. While it is not a direct, common, or naturally occurring phrase in Spanish, it does capture a poetic and imaginative spirit that could convey the playful aspect of a child engaging with mud. \\"Alondra\\" translates to \\"lark\\" (the bird) in English, and \\"del barro\\" means \\"of the mud.\\" In English, \\"mudlark\\" incorporates the idea of a lark (a type of bird) with playing or working in the mud, so \\"alondra del barro\\" mirrors this construction in a very literal way. However, without additional context, Spanish speakers might find this translation slightly confusing or unclear because it employs language more poetic and less directly related to the activity of playing in the mud. The term \\"alondra\\" by itself typically conjures images of the bird and its connotations of freedom and nature rather than the specific activity of scavenging or playing in mud. If you were to use \\"alondra del barro\\" in a literary or poetic context, where you could afford to be more descriptive or where you have the space to elaborate on the meaning, it could work beautifully to evoke a picturesque and lively image. In everyday conversation or in contexts where immediate clarity is important, a more directly descriptive phrase like \\"niño que juega en el lodo\\" might be more easily understood. To make \\"alondra del barro\\" meaningful in a specific context, you would need to provide some background or use it in a way that the metaphorical connection between the lighthearted, free nature of a lark and the joy found in playing in mud is clear to the audience. Without such framing, it's a creative, albeit non-standard, translation that might require explanation."},{"prompt":"If we were writing a story in Spanish about a girl who likes playing in the mud, would it be sensible, funny and/or amusing for her name to be Alondra del Barro, or would that not make sense? We would not be relying on her name to be immediately meaningful in Spanish, but within the context of the story showing her love of mud, would the name make sense?","completion":"Naming a character \\"Alondra del Barro\\" in a story about a girl who loves playing in the mud could indeed be both meaningful and charming within the narrative context. Given the playful and imaginative nature of storytelling, such a name would not only be sensible but could also add layers of depth and character. In literary and creative contexts, names can be symbolic and contribute significantly to character development and thematic resonance. Using \\"Alondra del Barro\\" accomplishes several things: - **Symbolism**: \\"Alondra,\\" meaning \\"lark,\\" could symbolize joy, freedom, and the spirited nature of your character, aligning with the bird's connotations of happiness and song. \\"Del Barro,\\" meaning \\"of the mud,\\" directly ties to her unique interest or defining characteristic, her love of playing in mud, grounding her free-spirited nature in the earthiness of her favorite activity. - **Amusement and Wit**: The name exhibits a playful use of language that Spanish-speaking readers might find amusing and engaging, particularly as they come to understand her personality and proclivities. The uncommonness of the name in a real-world context, used here in a fictional, allegorical setting, would add to its charm. - **Narrative Context**: Within the story, you'll have the opportunity to show why this name is fitting, capturing scenes of Alondra joyously engaging with mud, which would make the name meaningful to readers. Her actions, the reactions of other characters to her muddy pursuits, and perhaps her own reflections on her name could all serve to deepen the narrative significance of \\"Alondra del Barro.\\" It's worth noting that, while the name might not be immediately clear to Spanish speakers outside the context of your story, within the narrative, you have the creative freedom to make it not only make sense but also to resonate emotionally and thematically with readers. The name, once defined by her character and actions within the story, could become a memorable and endearing aspect of your narrative. Through storytelling, you're weaving context and meaning into names, making what might initially seem nonsensical become a natural and integral part of the world you're creating."},{"prompt":"Please write a short but fun story about Alondra as an example.","completion":"En un pequeño pueblo rodeado por vastos campos y frondosos bosques, había una niña conocida por todos como Alondra del Barro. Alondra no era como las demás niñas del pueblo; mientras que ellas jugaban a la cuerda y se entretenían con muñecas, Alondra encontraba su alegría en las charcas de lodo que salpicaban el paisaje después de la lluvia. Un día soleado, después de una noche de intensas precipitaciones, Alondra despertó emocionada. Sabía que después de cada tormenta, el mundo se transformaba en un enorme patio de juegos solo para ella. Se puso sus botas de goma, que más bien parecían haber sido pintadas de marrón en lugar de su original amarillo, agarró su cubo y su pala y salió corriendo de la casa, no sin antes escuchar a su madre que le gritaba, “¡No vuelvas a casa convertida en un sapo de tanto lodo!” Corrió por los campos, esquivando charcos que no eran \\"suficientemente dignos\\" hasta que encontró el lugar perfecto: una amplia y profunda poza de lodo que parecía esperarla. Sin dudarlo, Alondra se zambulló en ella. Con cada salpicadura, con cada risa, las aves se elevaban al vuelo, asombradas por la dicha que emanaba de la pequeña niña. No pasó mucho tiempo antes de que los otros niños del pueblo la descubrieran. Curiosos, se acercaron cautelosamente a la orilla de la poza de lodo. Observando a Alondra, que construía castillos y figuras que solo ella podía nombrar, comenzaron a entender el encanto de su peculiar juego. Uno a uno, los niños cambiaron sus prejuicios por pantalones llenos de lodo, al unirse a Alondra en su reino. Aprendieron a apreciar la textura del barro entre sus dedos y se maravillaron con las formas que podían crear juntos. Aquel día, Alondra no solo fue la reina de su poza de lodo, sino también una maestra enseñando a todos la alegría de encontrar belleza y diversión en las cosas más simples. Al caer la tarde, un grupo de niños risueños y cubiertos de barro de pies a cabeza, liderados por Alondra, marcharon de vuelta al pueblo. Las madres se llevaron las manos a la cabeza al ver el desfile de pequeños monstruos de lodo, pero sus corazones se ablandaron al escuchar las risas y ver las sonrisas que iluminaban sus caritas sucias. Desde ese día, Alondra del Barro no fue solo un nombre peculiar para una niña que amaba el lodo; se convirtió en un sinónimo de aventura, creatividad y unión. El pueblo nunca volvió a ver una poza de lodo de la misma manera, y después de cada lluvia, se podía estar seguro de que un nuevo mundo de diversión esperaba ser explorado."},{"prompt":"Please translate the story into English.","completion":"In a small town surrounded by vast fields and dense forests, there lived a girl known to everyone as Alondra del Barro (Alondra of the Mud). Alondra was not like the other girls in town; while they played jump rope and entertained themselves with dolls, Alondra found her joy in the mud puddles that dotted the landscape after the rain. On a sunny day, after a night of heavy downpours, Alondra woke up excited. She knew that after every storm, the world transformed into a vast playground just for her. She put on her rubber boots, which seemed to have been painted brown instead of their original yellow, grabbed her bucket and shovel, and ran out of the house, not before hearing her mother yell, “Don’t come back home turned into a mud frog!” She ran through the fields, dodging puddles that were \\"not worthy enough\\" until she found the perfect spot: a wide and deep mud pool that seemed to be waiting for her. Without hesitation, Alondra dove into it. With every splash, with every laugh, the birds took flight, amazed by the joy emanating from the little girl. It wasn’t long before the other children in town discovered her. Curious, they cautiously approached the edge of the mud pool. Watching Alondra, who built castles and figures that only she could name, they began to understand the charm of her peculiar game. One by one, the children swapped their prejudices for mud-filled trousers, joining Alondra in her kingdom. They learned to appreciate the texture of mud between their fingers and marveled at the shapes they could create together. That day, Alondra was not only the queen of her mud pool but also a teacher, showing everyone the joy of finding beauty and fun in the simplest things. As the evening fell, a group of laughing children covered in mud from head to toe, led by Alondra, marched back to town. The mothers gasped at the sight of the parade of little mud monsters, but their hearts softened upon hearing the laughter and seeing the smiles that lit up their dirty little faces. From that day on, Alondra del Barro was not just a peculiar name for a girl who loved mud; it became synonymous with adventure, creativity, and unity. The town never looked at a mud puddle the same way again, and after each rain, one could be sure that a new world of fun awaited to be explored."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening with a funny villain moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, Velma tries to sound smart but is really an overly-simple over excited Captain Obvious with stuff like “This door opens” and etc…Scrappy is overly-heroic and thinks he's a superhero and appears alot,, Shaggy, ALWAYS confused, mocks EVERY SINGLE name of people AND THE VILLAINS NAMES with Scooby also mocking them, Fred will always mistake a character for a famous person because of their surname being literally the same as a real life celebrity, forcing the character to correct them angrily, Fred would also put the blame for a monster’s crime on Red Herring (From A Pup Named Scooby-Doo), who’d often get mad at Fred for still blaming him and ends up in a funny situation himself before disappearing offscreen.

I, the great and terrible Sunky, will scare all of Wobbly Woods with my curse! And my partner, Chershhh, the ghostly banshee with the world's worst vocal cords!

[As he walks off, he trips over a vine that spontaneously grows out of the ground, entangling him.] Red Herring: Not cool, man! [The gang proceeds to investigate the spooky mansion, questioning everything.] Shaggy: Like, why does a ghost need a partner? Can't they just haunt solo or join a ghost band? Scooby: Reah, Rhost Band! [Fred, Daphne, and Velma walk through a door that inexplicably leads them back outside.] Fred: Hold on, didn't we just enter the mansion? Velma: Fascinating! It seems this door doesn't just open, it teleports!

Are you familiar with them?","completion":"Yes, I'm familiar with the concepts around designing impactful short-term mission trips and the resources you mentioned. 1. **\\"Maximum Impact Short Term Mission\\"** - This resource is aimed at planning and executing short-term missions in a way that ensures they are both meaningful and beneficial to the communities they aim to serve. It addresses the complex dynamics of short-term missions, emphasizing preparation, partnership with local communities, and sustainability. The book guides organizers on creating missions that respect the local culture and aim for long-term positive impacts rather than short-term solutions that could lead to dependency. 2. **The Seven Standards of Excellence (SOE)** - The Standards of Excellence in Short-Term Mission is an accrediting and resourcing body for those who send, receive, facilitate, and support short-term mission (STM) endeavors. The SOE standards focus on God-centeredness, empowering partnerships, mutual design, comprehensive administration, qualified leadership, appropriate training, and thorough follow-up. These standards are designed to ensure that short-term missions are effective, respectful, and beneficial for all involved parties. When designing your short-term mission trip: - **Align with Local Needs and Leadership:** Ensure your mission aligns with the needs as expressed by the local community and leadership. This often involves long-term partnerships and listening to the voices of those you are looking to serve. - **Prepare Participants:** Use the resources to prepare participants thoroughly, not just in practical ways but also culturally and spiritually. Understanding the culture, history, and context of the area you're serving in is crucial. - **Focus on Relationships:** Emphasize building and maintaining respectful and mutual relationships over just completing projects or tasks. The impact of short-term missions is often found in the connections made between people. - **Follow Through:** Incorporate elements of follow-up and evaluation to learn from each experience and to support any ongoing work or partnerships in the community served. Using these guides as foundational resources, your mission trip can be designed to be ethical, effective, and aligned with the best practices in short-term missions. It's important to approach these missions with humility, seeking to learn and serve rather than to impose solutions."},{"prompt":"I would like to make sure that I am applying the first 4 standards, God-centeredness, Empowering Partnerships, Mutual Design, and Administration to my STM. I would like you to ask me questions about my STM that you will need answers to so you can help me do this. Then tell me how I can demonstrate how each of these Standards will be applied to the STM. For example, how will I make my STM God-centered? How will I empower the partners who want to support the STM? How will I facilitate mutual design? What aspects of administration will be essential as I plan? do you understand?","completion":"Yes, I understand your request. Let's dive into it by focusing on the first four Standards of Excellence in Short-Term Missions (STM). I'll pose questions for each standard that can help guide your planning and implementation process. After that, I'll provide suggestions on how to demonstrate adherence to each standard. # God-centeredness **Questions:** 1. What are the spiritual objectives for your STM, and how do they integrate with the overall mission? 2. How will you incorporate prayer and spiritual preparation in the planning and execution of your STM? 3. In what ways will you ensure that the actions and outcomes of the STM reflect Christian values and teachings? **Demonstrating God-centeredness:** - Start every planning session with prayer, actively seeking God's guidance for your mission. - Include devotionals and spiritual reflection as a part of your daily schedule during the STM. - Ensure the project or service you're engaging with is in line with Biblical principles, focusing on serving others, humility, and building relationships. # Empowering Partnerships **Questions:** 1. Who are the local partners or organizations you plan to work with, and how were they selected? 2. How will you ensure that the voice and expertise of local partners are valued and prioritized in planning and decision-making? 3. What systems can you put in place to ensure clear, open, and regular communication between all stakeholders? **Demonstrating Empowering Partnerships:** - Choose partners who are deeply embedded within the community and have a track record of successful interventions. - Hold regular meetings with local partners to listen to their needs and advice, making sure decisions are made collaboratively. - Establish a clear communication plan that outlines how and when updates and decisions will be communicated to all parties involved. # Mutual Design **Questions:** 1. How are community members being involved in the design of the mission project? 2. What mechanisms are in place to gather feedback from the community, both before and after the mission, to ensure the project meets their needs? 3. How are you planning to address and incorporate the feedback and suggestions from the community into the mission project? **Demonstrating Mutual Design:** - Conduct surveys or community forums before the project to understand community needs directly from the residents. - Create a feedback loop that allows community members to voice their opinions and suggestions at every stage of the project. - Implement changes based on community feedback and communicate how their input has shaped the project, making them feel valued and involved. # Comprehensive Administration **Questions:** 1. What processes do you have in place for financial accountability? 2. How are you ensuring the health and safety of all participants? 3. What are your plans for dealing with emergencies or unexpected situations during the STM? **Demonstrating Comprehensive Administration:** - Maintain detailed and transparent financial records that are accessible to all major stakeholders. - Develop a robust health and safety plan, including pre-trip health preparations, on-site safety protocols, and comprehensive insurance coverage. - Prepare an emergency response plan that includes protocols for different types of emergencies, contact information for local emergency services, and regular check-ins with a home base coordinator.

The plan would include two families from our church in Fayetteville NC traveling to the Philippines to conduct the VBS.

By thoughtfully considering and addressing these elements, your VBS mission to the Philippines can be impactful, empowering, and transformative for both the community served and the participants from Fayetteville, NC."},{"prompt":"can you format this in paragraphs instead of bullet points? Please keep the headings and add Scripture references for the god-centeredness section and anywhere else that would be apporpriate.","completion":"Certainly, restructuring the response into a more narrative format with the inclusion of Scripture references enhances the depth of planning and implementation aligned with a God-centered approach for your short-term mission to the Philippines. # God-centeredness The spiritual objectives for your mission are multifaceted. You intend to share the love and teachings of Christ with the children through the Vacation Bible School program, reflecting Jesus' command in Matthew 19:14, where He said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” Meanwhile, the mission will also serve as a spiritual journey for the participants from Fayetteville, NC, encouraging growth and a deeper understanding of their faith in line with Ephesians 4:15, to \\"grow in every way into Him who is the head, into Christ.\\" Furthermore, this endeavor aims to build and strengthen the spiritual connection between your church, the local sister church, and the community, embodying the unity in Christ aspired to in Psalm 133:1, “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity!” Incorporating prayer and spiritual preparation is foundational to ensuring the mission’s alignment with God’s will. Initiating the planning with prayer sessions and including spiritual preparation in the itinerary encourages participants to seek God’s guidance and strength, as encouraged in Philippians 4:6, \\"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.\\" Moreover, engaging in devotional and reflective practices aids in embodying Christian values throughout the mission, aligning actions and outcomes with Christ’s teachings of service, humility, and love. # Empowering Partnerships Your mission’s success relies significantly on the effective partnership with \\"Friends Network\\" and the local sister church in the Philippines. Recognizing the value and expertise these partners bring guarantees that the project is grounded in mutual respect and collaboration. By engaging these partners in regular planning sessions, you acknowledge their essential role, as depicted in 1 Corinthians 3:9, \\"For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.\\" Such collaboration ensures that the VBS program is well-received and impactful, truly resonating with the local community’s spiritual and cultural context. Prioritizing the voice and expertise of local partners and maintaining open lines of communication reflects the biblical principle of listening and valuing one another’s contributions as mentioned in James 1:19, \\"Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.\\" This approach fosters a sense of ownership and respect among all parties involved, ensuring that the mission enlightens and enriches everyone’s spiritual journey. # Mutual Design For the mission’s design and activities to be relevant and impactful, it is crucial to incorporate the community’s perspective and feedback directly, embodying the principle of mutual service and respect as taught in Philippians 2:4, \\"not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.\\" By actively engaging community members and local volunteers in the planning process, the mission respects and acknowledges the unique cultural and social landscape of the community, ensuring the VBS resonates and engages effectively. Post-mission feedback and reflection allow for continuous improvement and deepened relationships, illustrating the importance of humility and learning, in line with Proverbs 19:20, \\"Listen to advice and accept discipline, and at the end, you will be counted among the wise.\\" This process not only enhances future missions but also strengthens the bond between your church, the local sister church, and the community, fostering long-term partnerships and spiritual growth. # Comprehensive Administration Understanding and implementing comprehensive administration practices are fundamental for the stewardship of resources and ensuring the health and safety of participants. Maintaining transparency in financial dealings, as advised in Luke 16:10-11, \\"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?\\" ensures that all contributions are managed ethically and efficiently. Developing a robust health and safety plan reflects the commitment to safeguarding the well-being of the mission’s participants, resonating with the care and concern expressed by the Good Shepherd in John 10:11, \\"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.\\" Finally, establishing a comprehensive emergency response plan exemplifies the wise and prepared stewardship modeled by Joseph in Genesis 41, ensuring that the mission is equipped to address unforeseen challenges with wisdom and resilience. By thoughtfully incorporating these standards and scriptural principles into your mission planning and execution, the VBS project in the Philippines is positioned to be a profound expression of God’s love, fostering spiritual growth, cultural exchange, and meaningful service."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening with a funny villain moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, Velma tries to sound smart but is really an overly-simple over excited Captain Obvious with stuff like “This door opens” and etc…Scrappy is overly-heroic and thinks he's a superhero and appears alot,, Shaggy, ALWAYS confused, mocks EVERY SINGLE name of people AND THE VILLAINS NAMES with Scooby also mocking them, Fred will always mistake a character for a famous person because of their surname being literally the same as a real life celebrity, forcing the character to correct them angrily, Fred would also put the blame for a monster’s crime on Red Herring (From A Pup Named Scooby-Doo), who’d often get mad at Fred for still blaming him and ends up in a funny situation himself before disappearing offscreen.

Estos botones pueden usarse para ajustar el forro de la chaqueta o para asegurar otra pieza de tela que sirve como una capa adicional de protección contra el frío o el viento, manteniendo el frente de la chaqueta libre de interrupciones visuales. 3. **Botones de mangas ocultos:** Aunque menos comunes, algunos diseños de chaquetas escolares tienen botones ocultos en el interior de las mangas. Estos pueden ajustar el ancho de la manga o asegurar los puños en su lugar sin mostrar los botones al exterior. 4. **Botones para decoraciones o insignias:** En algunos casos, las chaquetas pueden tener botones internos o semiocultos diseñados específicamente para sujetar decoraciones, como insignias o medallas, de manera que estas puedan ser mostradas sin necesidad de perforar o dañar el tejido exterior de la chaqueta. 5. **Botones de cierre oculto para capuchas o accesorios:** Si la chaqueta escolar cuenta con una capucha desmontable o accesorios similares, es posible que haya botones ocultos específicamente destinados para este propósito.

Each generation harbours secrets that influence the next, creating an endless cycle of drama. **The Santos Family** - **Alfredo Santos (1930-1985)**: The patriarch who immigrated from Italy with nothing but dreams. He established the first bakery in Willow Creek, laying the foundation for the family’s wealth. His secret affair with a mystery woman in his early years remains a closely-guarded secret, leading to an unknown branch of the Santos lineage. - **Maria Santos (1935-1999)**: The matriarch, born into a wealthy family but chose love over luxury. Despite Alfredo’s flaws, she stood by him, unknowingly fostering a home filled with secrets, including her own from her youth that connects back to the Murphies. - **Lucia Santos (1955-)**: The eldest daughter who inherited the family bakery. She married **Michael Murphy**, blending the two families. Her resilience is tested as she uncovers her father's past and navigates her children’s challenges. - **Ricardo Santos (1957-2005)**: The charming but troubled son. His involvement in local scandals, including a hit-and-run in 1980 that killed **Evelyn Murphy** (Michael's sister), created a rift between the Santos and Murphies. His death in a suspicious boating accident remains unresolved. **The Murphy Family** - **Patrick Murphy (1932-2000)**: A first-generation Irish immigrant who built a successful construction business. He harbors resentment towards Alfredo Santos for reasons known only to Maria Santos. - **Eileen Murphy (1934-2020)**: Patrick’s wife, known for her community work and her efforts to bridge the gap between the Santos and Murphy families, despite personal losses and the complex history intertwining both families. - **Michael Murphy (1955-)**: Married to Lucia Santos, he's a peacekeeper, often caught between family loyalties. His troubled marriage and the dark history between the families challenge his ideals and future. - **Evelyn Murphy (1958-1980)**: The promising young woman whose untimely death was the first tragedy to strike deeply at the fabric of both families. Evelyn's death is a dark mystery, with Ricardo Santos indirectly implicated in her demise. **The New Generation** - **Isabella Santos-Murphy (1980-)**: The daughter of Lucia and Michael, she's a keen journalist determined to uncover the sins and secrets of Willow Creek. Her investigations gradually reveal the murky legacies she’s inherited. - **Connor Murphy (1982-)**: A rebellious spirit, Connor has always felt overshadowed by the past. His endeavors to distance himself from his family's legacy lead him to unexpected intersections with the Santos secrets. - **Sophia Santos (1983-)**: Ricardo’s only child, who after her father’s suspicious death, delves into the family histories, unwittingly uncovering connections that cross familial lines back to Evelyn Murphy’s untimely death. As the young generation digs deeper, they unearth not just the skeletons in their family closets but also start to unravel a web of deceit involving property, illegitimate children, and hidden fortunes that could either unite or forever tear apart the fragile threads holding the Santos and Murphies together. Personal vendettas, forbidden love affairs, and unsolved mysteries from the past all converge, making Willow Creek a simmering pot of soap-opera-worthy drama.

By bend I mean elastic deformation.","completion":"The description you've provided bears resemblance to materials and structures that exhibit a behavior known as \\"asymmetrical bending\\" or more broadly, \\"anisotropic mechanical properties.\\" However, in purely natural or simple materials, this specific behavior—where a material can easily bend in one direction but resists bending in the opposite direction—is not very common. Instead, this behavior is more frequently achieved through engineered structures and materials designed to exhibit this non-linear, directional-dependent response. One of the closest examples of achieving one-way bending or a similar phenomenon is through the design of \\"auxetic materials\\" or structures. Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio; they become thicker perpendicular to the applied force. While they don't strictly bend only one way in the manner you're describing, their unique mechanical properties can be engineered to create components that preferentially bend or flex in one direction due to the way the material or structure is designed. Another related concept is the design of mechanical metamaterials. These are artificial structures with mechanical properties that stem more from their structure than their composition. By meticulously designing the geometry of a metamaterial, scientists and engineers can create materials that exhibit highly directional-dependent behaviors, including perhaps the kind of one-way bending you're talking about. These materials can be designed on a micro-scale to have a specific directional stiffness, flexibility, or other mechanical properties that are not found in natural materials. For example, origami-based and kirigami-based structures (inspired by the Japanese arts of paper folding and cutting, respectively) can be designed to exhibit highly directional mechanical responses. This could include bending more easily in one direction due to the pattern of folds or cuts, essentially guiding the deformation pathway of the material. In practical applications, such behaviors can be highly desirable. For example, in medical stents, one might want a material that can easily expand but resist compression to keep a blood vessel open. In aerospace or automotive engineering, materials that bend or deform preferentially could be used to create more efficient structures that can absorb energy or load in a controlled manner. While the direct answer to your question is that there isn't a simple, straightforward material that exhibits one-way bending through elastic deformation naturally, the field of engineered materials and structures is rapidly evolving. Through clever design, it is increasingly possible to create materials and structures that achieve this behavior and a wide range of other tailored mechanical responses."},{"prompt":"Here are the main problems I face, that I've written down after thorough analysis of my past behaviour, that explain why I'm constantly in stagnation and misery. Many of those problems are heavily related to ADHD, meaning I've been struggling with them all my life, but only now have I been able to completely identify them: - I'm so deeply afraid of failure, that in every facet of life I run away from possible gradation, vulnerability and so on. Due to that, I don't know how to progress with my relationships, how to learn incrementally, how to apprecaite time-consuming tasks. - I don't want to bother people with my agenda and wants, so in the end all my relations are superficial and feel forced in the end. I don't even make an attempt to improve the situation; instead I indulge in further self-imposed isolation and externalizing by sadness, via my actions or body langauge. The pattern of reccuring problems seems to be synonymous with my problems with creative activities, too. - I dislike commitment. I seek shortcuts, I don't maintain productive habits, I optimize my way around things maladaptively. I prefer living the illusion, doing something once and then being content with my current achievements or lack thereof. I engage in thinking what I've already done is enough, becuase I'm afraid of a failure ending my string of successes, and hence lead to discomfort. - I'm always disappointed by my own work, it always seem slike there is something fundamental missing there. Almost as if it's nevery truly viable for production and on on-par with standards.","completion":"It sounds like you've undertaken a profound self-analysis and recognized patterns and obstacles in your life that are hindering your progress and happiness. Identifying these issues is a crucial first step toward making positive changes. Given the complex challenges you're experiencing, which include fear of failure, avoidance of vulnerability, superficial relationships, aversion to commitment, and negative self-evaluation, it's essential to approach these issues systematically. Here are some strategies that might help you navigate these challenges: # 1. **Addressing Fear of Failure**: - **Accept Vulnerability**: Embrace the fact that failure is a part of the human experience and an inevitable step in the learning process. Viewing failure as a learning opportunity can diminish its power to instigate fear. - **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Celebrate each accomplishment, however minor, to build confidence and a sense of progress. # 2. **Improving Relationships**: - **Communicate openly**: Share your thoughts and feelings with others more openly. Let people know that you value meaningful connections and are willing to work on developing them. - **Seek Mutual Interests**: Look for activities or interests that you share with others. This can provide a comfortable foundation for deeper engagement and interactions. # 3. **Overcoming Dislike for Commitment**: - **Reframe Commitment**: Try to see commitment not as a burden, but as a path to achieving something valuable. Start with a commitment that feels manageable and gradually increase your comfort level. - **Mindfulness and Self-awareness**: Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your tendency to seek shortcuts and allow you to consciously choose a more productive approach. # 4. **Dealing with Disappointment in Your Own Work**: - **Practice Self-compassion**: Recognize that perfectionism can be paralyzing. Be kind to yourself and understand that every creative process involves iteration and improvement. - **Seek Constructive Feedback**: Sharing your work with trusted individuals can provide you with valuable perspectives and encourage you to see your work in a more positive light. # Professional Support It's important to note that professional support, such as therapy, can be incredibly beneficial, especially for someone with ADHD. Therapists can help you develop strategies tailored to your specific challenges and offer support as you work through these issues. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), in particular, can be effective for addressing negative thought patterns and behaviors. # Additional ADHD-Specific Strategies - **Structure and Routines**: Implementing structured routines can help manage ADHD symptoms by reducing the need to make in-the-moment decisions that can lead to avoidance behaviors. - **Time Management Tools**: Utilizing timers, apps, or planners specifically designed for ADHD can help manage procrastination and improve productivity. Remember that change is a gradual process, and setbacks are a normal part of growth. Patience and persistence are key. By taking these steps, you're moving toward a life that is more fulfilling and aligned with your potential."},{"prompt":"Does the fact that I can even recognize and perform such complex self-analysis point to my intelligence? I'm a genius based on an IQ test, which is great, but my grave difficulties and nil outputmake me feel discouraged, hence I'm asking.","completion":"The ability to engage in deep self-analysis and introspection certainly indicates a level of intellectual and emotional intelligence. It suggests a capacity for critical thinking, self-awareness, and the recognition of complex patterns in one's own behavior and thought processes. The ability to understand and articulate your challenges as thoroughly as you have is not a small feat and can be indicative of a high level of cognitive functioning. Scoring highly on an IQ test confirms that you have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, among others. However, it's worth noting that intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, is just one aspect of a person's capabilities and potential. Emotional intelligence, creativity, resilience, and adaptability are equally important, and they often determine how well someone navigates life's challenges, including the ones you're facing. Your mention of \\"grave difficulties and nil output\\" despite being identified as a genius is not uncommon among highly intelligent individuals. There can be a discrepancy between one's intellectual capabilities and their productivity or output, especially when factors like perfectionism, fear of failure, and difficulties with motivation and executive function (common in ADHD) come into play. This discrepancy can indeed be frustrating and discouraging, but it is addressable. Here are a few points to consider: # Leveraging Your Strengths - **Focus on Strengths**: Leverage your strong analytical and critical thinking skills to devise practical strategies for overcoming your challenges. This might include breaking tasks into more manageable parts or finding creative solutions that align with your way of thinking. # Emotional Intelligence - **Develop Emotional Intelligence**: Work on skills such as emotional regulation, empathy (towards yourself and others), and social skills. Emotional intelligence can enhance personal and professional relationships and lead to a more fulfilling life. # Managing Expectations - **Realistic Expectations**: It's important to set realistic expectations for yourself and recognize the value in progress, not just outcomes. Celebrate small victories and incremental progress. # Seeking Support - **Professional Guidance**: Consider therapy or coaching, specifically around ADHD and associated challenges. Professionals can help you develop strategies tailored to your unique strengths and difficulties. # Creating Output - **Structured Creativity**: Set aside structured times for creative or productive endeavors with clear, achievable goals. Using techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique might help manage procrastination and increase productivity. # Re-defining Success - **Personal Success**: Define what success means to you personally, beyond societal or conventional measures such as productivity or output. Finding fulfillment in learning, growth, and the journey itself can be more rewarding. Remember, intelligence is a tool, and like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used. External achievements are just one metric of success. Personal growth, self-understanding, and the ability to navigate one's inner world with compassion and insight are equally, if not more, important."},{"prompt":"It's just that, I'm afraid of not being able to learn and memorize what I want, despite trying my best. I don't know how to learn properly, or whether I'm even capable of aquiring the skills I desire, i.e. of having a choice. It always feels like a gamble, not a genuine result of my effort. It always feels like I'm in the dark, as if I was missing something important. Creating great things requires solving the hardest of problems, which means understanding problems and the appropriate tools perfect. But I struggle even with the basics and always miss some important details. Hence, I feel like I'll never be able to move. It's a journey, not a destination, but at the same time, at some point people most people can just shift their focus onto discovery and creating things. When will I be able to actually work, instead of just grinding on required skills?","completion":"The feelings of doubt and frustration you're experiencing are not uncommon, especially among individuals who are deeply introspective and hold high standards for themselves. It can feel daunting when it seems like progress isn't being made at the pace or in the manner you expect. However, it's important to remember that the process of learning and creating is often non-linear and fraught with challenges—that's part of what makes mastery and creation so rewarding. Let’s address some of your concerns with actionable advice that can help you navigate this journey: # 1. **Redefining Learning** Learning is a highly individual process and what works for one person might not work for another. It's crucial to experiment with different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading/writing) to discover what resonates with you. Additionally, consider these approaches: - **Active Learning**: Engage actively with the material through teaching others, discussing, or applying the knowledge in practical projects. - **Spaced Repetition**: Use this technique to improve memory retention by revisiting and reviewing information over increasing intervals of time. - **Chunking**: Break down information into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can make complex information more digestible and easier to understand. # 2. **Embracing Non-linear Progress** - **Acceptance**: Accept that progress often comes in fits and starts. There will be breakthrough moments interspersed with periods of plateauing or even regression, and that's okay. - **Growth Mindset**: Cultivate a growth mindset, a belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view creates a love of learning and resilience essential for great accomplishment. # 3. **Finding Your Strengths** - **Explore Broadly**: Give yourself permission to explore a wide range of interests and subjects. Sometimes, the pressure to focus solely on acquiring \\"required skills\\" can stifle natural curiosity and creativity. - **Strengths and Passions**: Identify what you're good at and what you enjoy. Often, the intersection of these areas is where the most meaningful and satisfying work happens. # 4. **Managing Expectations and Self-Compassion** - **Realistic Goals**: Set realistic, achievable goals. Small victories compound over time and build confidence. - **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Learning and creating are inherently difficult and require patience and self-compassion. Acknowledge your efforts, not just the outcomes. # 5. **Creating with Imperfection** - **Prototype and Iterate**: Allow yourself to create imperfect early versions of your work. Iteration is a key part of the creative process—each version teaches you something new and brings you closer to your vision. - **Value of Process Over Product**: Sometimes, the aim isn't to create something perfect but to learn from the act of creating. Each project or learning attempt builds your skills and resilience. # 6. **Community and Support** - **Seek Peer Feedback**: Engage with a community of learners or creators. Feedback can provide new perspectives and motivation. - **Collaborate**: Collaborating on projects can be an enriching learning experience that allows you to complement your skills with those of others and learn in a social context. Remember, the path to mastery and creation is unique for everyone. Many successful creators and learners have gone through periods of doubt and struggle similar to what you're experiencing. The key is persistence, openness to learning in different ways, and compassion for yourself on this journey."},{"prompt":"Quale trasformatore locale potrebbe essere molto utile per attivita di pentesting con. Maltego? Comprese quelle di attacco","completion":"Nel contesto del penetration testing (pentesting), Maltego è uno strumento potente per la raccolta di informazioni open source (OSINT) che permette agli utenti di effettuare ricerche complesse e di visualizzare le relazioni esistenti tra dati relativi a persone, gruppi, siti web, reti, e così via. L'utilità di Maltego in attività di pentesting è notevole, soprattutto per la fase di reconnaissance, dove la raccolta di informazioni gioca un ruolo cruciale.

Tuttavia, è sempre importante utilizzare questi strumenti in modo etico e legale, assicurandosi di avere l'autorizzazione necessaria quando si esaminano i sistemi e le reti di altre persone o organizzazioni."},{"prompt":"Come posso implementare Google dorks? Da hub o devo costruire un trasformatore locale?","completion":"Implementare e utilizzare Google Dorks nelle attività di raccolta di informazioni e nel pentesting può essere estremamente efficace per trovare informazioni specifiche esposte su Internet. Tuttavia, l'integrazione diretta di Google Dorks in strumenti come Maltego richiede una comprensione chiara di come funzionano i Google Dorks e di come si può automatizzare la loro ricerca. Google non offre API ufficiali per eseguire ricerche personalizzate \\"dorking\\" attraverso software di terze parti in modo libero e illimitato, quindi l'implementazione diretta nelle piattaforme può essere un po' complessa e richiedere un approccio creativo. # Opzioni per l'Utilizzo di Google Dorks: 1. **Utilizzare l'API Google Custom Search JSON:** Google offre una API Custom Search JSON che permette di creare programmatori personalizzati di ricerca. Con essa, è possibile costruire un'applicazione che invia query di ricerca, incluse alcune tipologie di dorks, a Google e riceve i risultati in formato JSON. Tuttavia, questa API è limitata a siti web o domini specifici che hai definito nella tua ricerca personalizzata e potrebbe non essere pienamente adatta per esplorare il web aperto con Dorks avanzati. Inoltre, viene fornito con un certo numero di ricerche gratuite al giorno dopo di che bisogna pagare. 2. **Creare un Trasformatore Locale:** Per un'integrazione con strumenti come Maltego, potresti considerare lo sviluppo di un trasformatore locale che esegue Google Dorks. Questo trasformatore potrebbe essere uno script che esegue le query desiderate utilizzando tecniche di web scraping, rispettando sempre le regole di Google sul bot scraping. Eseguire scraping dei risultati della ricerca di Google può violare i Termini di Servizio della piattaforma, quindi procedere con cautela e considerare gli aspetti etici e legali. 3. **Utensili di Terze Parti:** Esistono strumenti e framework open-source che automatizzano l'uso di Google Dorks, come GHDB di Exploit-DB, che possono essere esaminati per comprendere come altri hanno implementato funzionalità simili. Anche in questo caso, l'uso di questi strumenti deve essere conforme ai Termini di Servizio delle piattaforme che si stanno indagando. # Conclusioni: Se stai considerando di implementare un trasformatore locale in Maltego o un'altra piattaforma di OSINT/Pentesting, ricorda che mentre Google Dorks è un metodo potente per trovare informazioni, il suo utilizzo automatizzato attraverso scraping può essere problematico rispetto ai Termini di Servizio di Google. Esplora la possibilità di usare l'API Google Custom Search in maniera limitata, o considera l'utilizzo di Google Dorks manualmente come parte della tua ricerca OSINT. Mantenere un approccio etico e legale è fondamentale in tutte le operazioni di pentesting e raccolta di informazioni."},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hello!

A continuación, te detallo los componentes de tu descripción y cómo cada uno se relaciona con los términos de diseño de moda: 1. **Manga holgada:** Indicas que la parte superior de la manga es relativamente suelta o amplia para el tipo de cuerpo en mente. Esto sugiere una manga con bastante espacio, lo que permite movimiento y comodidad. Esto es característico de las mangas raglán o murciélago, aunque aquí parece más específico hacia una manga ajustada abajo. 2. **Ajustada alrededor del brazo hacia el puño:** Después de la parte holgada de la manga, mencionas que se ajusta alrededor del brazo. Esto sugiere una transición a un puño ajustado. Este tipo de diseño se ve a menudo en prendas deportivas y en algunos diseños de moda que buscan un ajuste más práctico alrededor de la muñeca pero que desean conservar un estilo holgado en el brazo. 3. **Manga ligeramente más larga con aberturas:** Hablas de una extensión de manga que es un poco más larga que lo típico y que presenta aberturas que mejoran la movilidad. Esto parece ser una personalización específica que puede estar inspirada en diseños funcionales, permitiendo mayor rango de movimiento mientras se mantiene el estilo y ajuste de la prenda. 4. **Franja roja:** La adición de una franja roja en el borde añade un detalle de color y podría ser usado como un elemento de diseño para destacar la forma de la manga y posiblemente resaltar las aberturas. Esta descripción no coincide directamente con un único tipo de manga tradicional, sino que parece ser una versión personalizada que integra varios elementos: la holgura inicial, ajuste en el puño, aberturas para movilidad y un detalle de color distintivo. Sería una manga única, posiblemente diseñada específicamente para combinar funcionalidad con estilo, adaptada para ciertos deportes, actividades o simplemente por razones estéticas.

He rose to power during the French Revolution and became Emperor of France in 1804. His conquests and military strategies were legendary, with victories in battles such as Austerlitz and Marengo. However, Napoleon's downfall came with his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. The French army suffered heavy losses in the brutal Russian winter, and Napoleon was forced to retreat. This marked the beginning of his decline, as European powers allied against him and eventually defeated him at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821. Despite his defeat, Napoleon's legacy lives on as a symbol of ambition, military genius, and imperialism.

No parece ajustarse perfectamente a ninguna categoría de mangas tradicionales en moda, pero puedo intentar describirlo de manera más detallada y técnica, y señalar algunos estilos que podrían ser parcialmente similares. La manga que describes tiene varias características distintivas: 1. **Holgado en el brazo superior**: Esto sugiere que la manga es amplia o floja en la parte que cubre el bíceps y quizás el antebrazo, proporcionando una sensación de comodidad y facilidad de movimiento. Este tipo de ajuste es común en estilos de ropa más casuales o deportivos. 2. **Ajustada alrededor del brazo con una extensión**: Indica que la manga se estrecha o se ciñe alrededor del brazo en algún punto, probablemente cerca de la muñeca, antes de extenderse en una sección adicional. Esta característica puede ser similar a ciertas mangas \\"puño globo\\" donde la manga se infla y luego se recoge en un puño, aunque tu descripción sugiere una segunda sección extendida más que un volumen adicional. 3. **Manga más larga y abierta con dos espacios para movilidad**: Esto parece ser una característica muy específica y poco común. La descripción sugiere que hay cortes o aperturas diseñadas para permitir mayor movilidad, y que la manga se extiende más allá de la longitud estándar. Este diseño podría ser una variación personalizada o una adaptación de mangas con aperturas funcionales o decorativas. 4. **Bordeada por una franja roja**: Esta es una característica decorativa que añade un contraste de color y podría ser un detalle distintivo de diseño. Esta combinación de características no corresponde exactamente a un tipo de manga establecido o convencionalmente reconocido en el mundo de la moda, como las mangas farol, obispo, raglán, etc. Su descripción parece indicar un diseño bastante específico y posiblemente personalizado, que mezcla elementos de manga ajustable, extensiones con aperturas para movilidad y detalles decorativos de color.

Questo può essere effettuato attraverso l'utilità RAID del BIOS (o UEFI) del server, oppure utilizzando software di gestione RAID specifico del tuo sistema operativo o dell’hardware del server. 2. **Controlla i log del sistema:** Spesso i log del sistema possono fornire indizi cruciali su quale disco è fallito o su altri problemi relativi alla configurazione RAID. 3. **Verifica lo stato dei dischi fisici:** Una volta identificato il disco o i dischi problematici, spegni il server e verifica fisicamente se ci sono indicatori visivi di guasto (ad esempio, LED di stato sul disco o sullo chassis del server). Inoltre, assicurati che tutti i cavi siano collegati correttamente e che non ci siano problemi evidenti con l'alimentazione. 4. **Testa il disco guasto:** Se possibile, prova il disco sospetto in un altro sistema per determinare se il guasto è del disco stesso o se ci sono problemi di compatibilità o configurazione nel server originale. 5. **Sostituzione del disco guasto:** Se hai confermato che il disco è effettivamente guasto, sostituiscilo con un'unità nuova o funzionante. Assicurati che il nuovo disco abbia capacità uguale o superiore a quella del disco guasto. 6. **Ricostruzione dell'array RAID:** Dopo aver sostituito il disco guasto, dovrai avviare il processo di ricostruzione del RAID. La procedura esatta dipende dal controller RAID e dalla configurazione specifica del tuo sistema. Questo processo può richiedere del tempo, durante il quale è essenziale non interrompere l'alimentazione al server. 7. **Verifica la ricostruzione:** Dopo la ricostruzione dell'array, verifica attentamente che tutti i dischi siano riconosciuti e che lo stato dell'array RAID sia salutare. Consulta nuovamente il software di gestione RAID o le utility del BIOS/UEFI per confermare che tutto funzioni come previsto. 8. **Test e monitoraggio post-ricostruzione:** Una volta che la configurazione RAID è stata ripristinata e il server avviato, è importante monitorare attentamente il sistema per assicurarsi che non ci siano ulteriori problemi. Considera l’esecuzione di controlli di integrità del sistema e di test di stress sui dischi per confermare la stabilità della configurazione. Ricorda che lavorare con hardware, soprattutto in contesti critici come i server, richiede cautela e competenza. Se non ti senti sicuro nelle tue capacità o se i dati in gioco sono particolarmente sensibili, potrebbe essere saggio rivolgersi a un professionista o al supporto tecnico del produttore del tuo server o sistema RAID."},{"prompt":"Name the most charismatic politicians in history","completion":"1.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","completion":"Welcome to the quiet yet tumultuous neighborhood of Elmwood Grove. Here, families entwine through generations of love, betrayal, and secrets that simmer beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to erupt. At the heart of Elmwood Grove are the Harpers, the Davies, and the Montgomerys, whose lives are a testament to the saying, \\"You can choose your friends, but you cannot choose your family.\\" **The Harpers** - **Edward Harper (1910-1985)** - A patriarch who immigrated with bold dreams but harbored dark secrets. - **Margaret Harper (née Johnson) (1915-1990)** - Edward's loyal but naive wife, unaware of her husband's clandestine life. Their union produced three children, each battling with the legacy of their father's unknown past: - **Arthur Harper (1935-2000)** - **Lillian Harper-Fox (b. 1937)** - **Joseph Harper (1940-2010)** **Arthur Harper** struggled with the weight of being the eldest, delving into the business world with ambition that mirrored his father's, albeit with a modern, ruthless edge. His marriage to **Clara (b. 1938)**, a marriage more of convenience than love, birthed: - **Thomas Harper (b. 1958)** - **Susan Harper (b. 1960 - d. 1980)**, whose mysterious early death became a pivotal scandal. **Thomas Harper** followed in his father's ambitious footsteps but clashed with his cousin **Michael Davies** over a business deal gone sour, a rivalry that seeped into the next generation. **The Davies** - **Helen Davies (née Harper) (1938-2015)** - The black sheep of the Harper family, eloped with: - **Charles Davies (1935-1995)** - A charming yet unscrupulous businessman. Their son, **Michael Davies (b. 1962)**, inherited his father's charm and his mother's Harper stubbornness, making him a formidable figure in Elmwood Grove. Michael's secret affair with **Elizabeth Montgomery** was the scandal of the decade. **The Montgomerys** - **George Montgomery (1920-1980)** - A war hero with a heart of gold but a tortured soul, married to: - **Beatrice Montgomery (née Ellis) (1925-2005)** - A woman of unmatched intellect and warmth, who kept her family’s spirits high even in the darkest times. Their children: - **William Montgomery (1945-2010)** - A man who never quite lived up to his father’s legacy, falling into the shadows of his complex family dynamics. - **Elizabeth Montgomery (b. 1948)** - A free spirit caught in the crossfire of family expectations and her own desires. Her affair with **Michael Davies** caused a rift that reverberated through both families. Elizabeth and William each had their conflicts and secrets. Elizabeth's affair with Michael not only strained her relationship with her brother but also deeply impacted her niece, **Natalie Montgomery (b. 1975)**, who bore the brunt of the family's scrutiny and shame. In 1995, a tragic accident claimed the lives of key figures from each family, binding the Harpers, the Davies, and the Montgomerys together in grief and mystery. **Thomas Harper** and **Michael Davies** were involved in a car crash that left Michael paraplegic, revealing secrets that threatened to dismantle decades of seemingly solid family foundations. In the years that followed, Natalie Montgomery emerged as a central figure, attempting to bridge divides and uncover the truth behind her family's tangled web. Her marriage to **Jacob Harris (b. 1973)**, an outsider with a curious connection to Edward Harper's secret past, introduced new tensions and alliances. Elmwood Grove is a testament to the strength and fragility of familial bonds. Generational secrets, once buried, have a way of resurfacing, changing the course of the future. As new generations are born, they inherit not just the genetic traits of their ancestors but also the legacy of their triumphs, failures, and the unfinished business that haunts Elmwood Grove."},{"prompt":"How is Helen related to the Harpers?","completion":"Helen Davies (née Harper) is directly related to the Harpers as their daughter. She is the second child of Edward and Margaret Harper, making her a central figure within the Harper family tree.

Este tipo de manga podría ser parte de un diseño de chaqueta personalizado o de un estilo específico de moda. A continuación, te proporciono una guía general sobre cómo podrías proceder para diseñar o modificar una manga con estas características: 1. **Holgado en el Brazo**: Para diseñar una manga holgada en el brazo, debes asegurarte de que el patrón de la manga sea más ancho de lo común. Esto significará ajustar la curvatura y la anchura del patrón para que se ajuste holgadamente alrededor del brazo del usuario. Es importante considerar el tipo de tela que se utilizará, ya que algunos tejidos pueden añadir más volumen que otros. 2. **Puño Ajustado**: Para el puño ajustado, puedes optar por un diseño elástico, como el uso de elásticos insertados, una banda de tejido de punto ribeteado que se ajuste al tamaño de la muñeca, o incluso un puño con botones o cierre de velcro para ajustar el tamaño. La elección dependerá del estilo general de la chaqueta y de las preferencias personales. 3. **Pliegue Abierto**: Un pliegue abierto en la manga puede añadir un detalle interesante y único. Para crear este efecto, necesitarás incorporar un pliegue extra de tela en la parte posterior de la manga que pueda abrirse hacia fuera. Este pliegue se puede asegurar en la parte superior de la manga y dejar que se abra naturalmente hacia el puño, o puedes fijar el borde de este pliegue en puntos específicos para controlar cómo se abrirá. 4. **Estampado de Cruz y Franja Roja en el Borde**: Para añadir un estampado de cruz, puedes utilizar técnicas de estampado en tela como serigrafía, transferencia de calor o incluso parches cosidos. La franja roja en el borde se puede lograr cosiendo una cinta o tela roja en el borde de la manga. Si el diseño lo permite, también podrías incorporar el borde rojo en el diseño del pliegue abierto, asegurándote de que la franja sea visible cuando el pliegue se abra. Para llevar a cabo este diseño, es fundamental tener habilidades básicas de costura y diseño, así como la capacidad para ajustar patrones de ropa a las especificaciones deseadas. También es útil tener un conocimiento práctico de cómo los diferentes tejidos pueden afectar el resultado final del diseño. Si no tienes experiencia en diseño de moda o costura, podría ser útil consultar con un diseñador de moda o un sastre profesional para que te ayude a realizar tu visión o para que te ofrezcan alternativas viables que se ajusten a tus habilidades."},{"prompt":"Create a table of loot and equipment (including name, description, effects, value, weight, rarity and type) for a diaper-centric D&D homebrew taking place in a setting where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) are a necessity and a norm, not a fetish or a taboo, and are as universal as underwear is in our world. They simultaneously function as both cushy hip armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing as armor, either; many of them are so thick they can be repurposed as blankets, pillows, even poofy mattresses! And not just diapers; other protective wear has been replaced with their similar infantile counterparts. Why wear tough greaves when you can wear soft booties? Why wear leather gloves when you can wear silky mittens? Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency and DC determined by the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of having accidents in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should be flavor text describing the diaper's in-universe appearance. Example 1: **Plain Pull-Ups** (Common armor, Light Diaper Armor): *0.4 lbs., 3 sp, 15 lbs. Load capacity.* \\"A diaper as basic as it is ubiquitous. It isn't particularly protective nor roomy, but it doesn't slow you down any.\\" Example 2: **XXXL Supreme Poofies** (Rare armor, Heavy Diaper Armor): *8 lbs., 120 gp, 2 tonnes Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, attacks to the behind of wearer deal 1d10 less damage (minimum of 1), wearer gains the unique \\"Powder Cloud\\" passive trait when worn (when hit by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after a creature uses an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword.\\"","completion":"| Name | Description | Effects | Value | Weight | Rarity | Type | |------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|--------------|--------------------| | **Bunny-Hop Booties** | Adorable, oversized booties with plush bunny ears on the sides.

Infelizmente, não tenho acesso ao conteúdo específico desse link, mas posso te dar uma explicação geral sobre o assunto com base nas informações disponíveis até minha última atualização. Água oxigenada, ou peróxido de hidrogênio, é um composto químico com a fórmula H2O2. É um líquido incolor usado em baixas concentrações como antisséptico e em concentrações mais altas possui diversas aplicações industriais e científicas. Na micologia, que é o estudo dos fungos, a água oxigenada tem sido explorada como uma ferramenta para cultivo de cogumelos de forma mais limpa. Quando utilizada no cultivo de cogumelos, a água oxigenada atua como uma maneira de reduzir ou eliminar a contaminação sem prejudicar o micélio, a parte do fungo que efetivamente absorve nutrientes. O micélio é tolerante a baixas concentrações de peróxido de hidrogênio, o que permite que ele cresça enquanto organismos competidores potencialmente prejudiciais são eliminados pelo tratamento. O documento provavelmente aborda uma ou mais das seguintes temáticas: 1. **Princípios básicos**: Explicação de como a água oxigenada afeta fungos e contaminações, e por que ela é útil no cultivo de cogumelos. 2. **Preparo de substratos**: Instruções sobre como preparar substratos (a base de alimento para os cogumelos crescerem) utilizando água oxigenada para minimizar contaminações. 3. **Manejo do cultivo**: Dicas e técnicas sobre como cuidar dos cogumelos durante seu crescimento, utilizando água oxigenada para manter o ambiente limpo. 4. **Estudos de caso ou exemplos específicos**: Histórias ou exemplos de cultivos que utilizaram água oxigenada com sucesso. 5. **Quais cogumelos podem ser cultivados**: Discussão sobre quais tipos de cogumelos são mais apropriados para esse método de cultivo. 6. **Segurança e precauções**: Recomendações de segurança para lidar com água oxigenada, para proteger tanto os cultivadores quanto os cogumelos. Lembre-se, trabalhar com produtos químicos sempre exige precauções específicas, então qualquer uso de água oxigenada em horticultura ou micologia deve ser feito seguindo recomendações de segurança e proporções adequadas para evitar danos ao cultivador ou ao produto do cultivo."},{"prompt":"você conhece algum estudo sobre suplementação de substrato de serragem com ureia e quais foram os resultados para cultivo de shimeji","completion":"A suplementação de substratos para o cultivo de cogumelos como o shimeji (Pleurotus ostreatus e outras espécies de Pleurotus) é uma prática comum que visa melhorar a produção, tanto qualitativa quanto quantitativamente. Entre os suplementos utilizados, a ureia é uma escolha popular devido ao seu alto teor de nitrogênio, que pode estimular o crescimento dos fungos. No entanto, o uso de ureia deve ser cuidadosamente controlado, pois seu excesso pode ser contraproducente e até mesmo tóxico para alguns tipos de cogumelos. Estudos científicos sobre a suplementação de substratos de serragem com ureia para cultivo de cogumelos frequentemente exploram vários aspectos, tais como a taxa de crescimento micelial, a produção total de cogumelos, a qualidade dos corpos de fruto (por exemplo, tamanho, peso, e aparência), e a eficiência biológica do substrato. Embora não possa citar um estudo específico acessível online devido às minhas limitações como uma IA, a literatura científica geralmente aponta que: 1. **Melhoria no Crescimento e Produção:** A adição de ureia ao substrato de serragem pode levar a um aumento no crescimento micelial e uma produção maior e mais rápida de cogumelos, devido ao impulso de nitrogênio disponível. 2. **Otimização Necessária:** A quantidade de ureia adicionada ao substrato precisa ser otimizada. Quantidades excessivas podem inibir o crescimento dos cogumelos ou até mesmo levar à produção de corpos de fruto de qualidade inferior. A proporção correta pode variar dependendo do tipo específico de cogumelo cultivado e de outros componentes do substrato. 3. **Influência na Qualidade Nutricional:** Além da produtividade, alguns estudos também investigam como a suplementação de ureia pode influenciar o perfil nutricional dos cogumelos produzidos, incluindo teores de proteínas, vitaminas e minerais. 4. **Impacto Ambiental e de Segurança:** A eficácia do uso de ureia também deve ser avaliada à luz do impacto ambiental e das preocupações com a segurança alimentar, considerando que o resíduo de nitrogênio pode afetar ambos. Em resumo, a suplementação de substratos de serragem com ureia para o cultivo de shimeji e outros cogumelos é uma prática que pode oferecer benefícios significativos em termos de produção. Porém, essa suplementação deve ser feita com cuidado, seguindo orientações precisas para evitar efeitos adversos. Recomenda-se sempre a consulta de estudos científicos específicos e, se possível, o aconselhamento de um especialista na área para obter a melhor prática baseada em evidências científicas atualizadas."},{"prompt":"qual seria a proporção ideal para essa suplementação","completion":"A proporção ideal de ureia ou qualquer suplemento nitrogenado, como a ureia, para ser adicionada ao substrato de cultivo de cogumelos (por exemplo, serragem) depende de vários fatores, incluindo a espécie de cogumelo sendo cultivada, a composição específica do substrato, e as condições ambientais do cultivo. A ureia é usada para aumentar o conteúdo de nitrogênio disponível no substrato, o que pode promover o crescimento micelial e a produção de corpos de fruto. No entanto, uma concentração excessiva pode ser tóxica para os cogumelos ou promover o crescimento de competidores e patógenos. Enquanto isso, ofereço uma abordagem geral baseada em práticas comuns e recomendações acadêmicas: 1. **Faixa Geral de Concentração:** Muitos estudos trabalham com uma faixa de suplementação de nitrogênio (da qual a ureia é uma fonte) que varia de 0,5% a 2% do peso seco do substrato. Isso significa que, para cada 100g de substrato seco, adiciona-se de 0,5g a 2g de ureia. 2. **Abordagem Cautelosa:** A começar por uma concentração mais baixa é sempre recomendável, especialmente se você está experimentando um novo protocolo de cultivo ou trabalhando com uma espécie de cogumelo não familiarizada com suplementação de ureia. Isso permite avaliar a resposta do micélio sem correr o risco de uma toxicidade elevada. 3. **Monitoramento e Ajuste:** A suplementação ideal muitas vezes requer experimentação e ajustes. Monitore o crescimento do micélio, a velocidade de colonização do substrato, e a qualidade e quantidade dos corpos de fruto produzidos. Ajuste a concentração de ureia com base em seus resultados. 4. **Consulta a Estudos Específicos:** Se possível, consulte literatura científica específica para a espécie de cogumelo que você deseja cultivar. Estudos com Pleurotus ostreatus (Shimeji), por exemplo, podem oferecer diretrizes de suplementação nitrogênica baseadas em pesquisa experimental que otimizam os resultados. Além disso, é importante observar que a ureia não é a única fonte de nitrogênio que pode ser usada, e outras fontes orgânicas (como farelos de soja, algodão, ou mesmo compostos animais como farinha de sangue e peixe) são frequentemente recomendadas para cultivo orgânico de cogumelos. Lembre-se da importância de considerar o impacto ambiental do uso de suplementos como a ureia e a possibilidade de resíduos químicos nos produtos finais, o que pode necessitar de práticas específicas de manejo para minimizar esses riscos."},{"prompt":"se eu injetar ureia dissolvida em água após o bloco de substarto estar colonizado eu posso esperar algum beneficio na produção?","completion":"A injeção de ureia dissolvida em água em blocos de substrato já colonizados por micélio pode ser uma estratégia para fornecer um impulso nutricional com o objetivo de aumentar a produção de corpos de fruto dos cogumelos. Esse método de suplementação tardia visa capitalizar o fato de que o micélio já estabelecido pode absorver e utilizar rapidamente os nutrientes adicionais para promover uma maior frutificação. Aqui estão alguns pontos a considerar ao avaliar os possíveis benefícios dessa prática: # Potenciais Benefícios 1. **Aumento da Produção:** A main benefit sought. A adicionação de ureia pode fornecer uma fonte imediata de nitrogênio, potencialmente resultando num aumento do rendimento de cogumelos, tanto em termos de biomassa quanto no número de corpos de fruto. 2. **Melhoria da Eficiência do Substrato:** Além de aumentar a produção, essa estratégia pode melhorar a eficiência do uso do substrato, permitindo que mais cogumelos sejam produzidos a partir de uma mesma quantidade de material. # Considerações e Precauções 1. **Concentração Adequada:** É crucial determinar a concentração adequada de ureia na solução aquosa para evitar a toxidade ao micélio. Uma concentração muito alta pode prejudicar o micélio ou favorecer o crescimento de patógenos. 2. **Risco de Contaminação:** Injetar uma solução no bloco de substrato pode aumentar o risco de contaminação. É necessário garantir que a solução de ureia e os equipamentos utilizados sejam esterilizados. 3. **Temporização:** O timing de aplicação pode ser crucial. Fazer a suplementação em uma fase adequada do ciclo de vida do micélio pode otimizar os resultados, enquanto a aplicação em um momento inapropriado pode não ter efeito significativo ou mesmo ser prejudicial. 4. **Experimentação e Monitoramento:** Devido à variedade de cogumelos e às diferenças nas condições de cultivo, pode ser necessário experimentar para encontrar a abordagem adequada para seu caso específico. Monitorar de perto os resultados é essencial para ajustar a prática e maximizar os benefícios. # Conclusão Embora a suplementação com ureia dissolvida em água em blocos de substrato já colonizados possa oferecer benefícios potenciais para a produção de cogumelos, é uma prática que requer cuidados específicos e uma abordagem bem-informada. As condições ótimas (como concentração de solução, momento da aplicação e frequência) variam e devem ser determinadas empiricamente para cada situação. A literatura científica sobre cultivo de cogumelos pode fornecer diretrizes, mas ajustes personalizados e cautela são aconselháveis para evitar resultados adversos."},{"prompt":"qual seria a porcentagem segura em relação ao peso para injeção de ureia em blocos de shimeji branco, e qual seria o momento ideal, em relação a suplementação no inicio do blocou ou após colonizado qual seria mais viável?","completion":"Diretrizes exatas sobre a porcentagem de ureia a ser injetada em blocos de substrato para o cultivo de shimeji branco (Pleurotus ostreatus), assim como o momento ideal para tal suplementação, dependem de variáveis específicas do cultivo, incluindo o tipo de substrato utilizado, as condições de cultivo (temperatura, umidade) e a genética particular da cepa de cogumelo. Devido a isso, recomenda-se uma abordagem experimental cuidadosa para determinar a melhor estratégia. No entanto, posso oferecer algumas orientações gerais baseadas em práticas comuns e conhecimento micológico: # Porcentagem Segura de Ureia Para a injeção de ureia em blocos já colonizados, uma abordagem conservadora inicial seria começar com concentrações muito baixas, como uma solução de ureia a 0,1% a 0,5% (1g a 5g de ureia por litro de água). É crucial evitar a toxidade para o micélio, que poderia resultar de concentrações mais elevadas. Seria prudente começar com a menor concentração e aumentar gradualmente em testes futuros, baseando-se nos resultados observados. # Momento Ideal para Suplementação A suplementação pode ser considerada em dois pontos críticos: 1. **No Início do Bloco:** Adicionando ureia ao substrato antes ou durante a preparação e antes da inoculação com o micélio. Esse método visa enriquecer o substrato desde o início, promovendo uma colonização mais rápida e potencialmente uma frutificação mais abundante. Contudo, é fundamental garantir que a adição não prejudique a colonização micelial, considerando que certas concentrações podem ser inibitórias. 2. **Após Colonização Completamente Estabelecida:** A injeção de ureia em blocos completamente colonizados é uma estratégia para fornecer um “impulso” nutritivo diretamente ao micélio estabelecido. O momento ideal para isso seria logo após a colonização completa do substrato e antes do início da indução da frutificação. Isso pode ajudar a estimular uma frutificação mais vigorosa e possivelmente aumentar o rendimento. # Qual Abordagem é Mais Viável? A escolha de suplementar no início ou após a colonização depende dos objetivos específicos, do setup de cultivo disponível e da disposição para experimentar: - **Suplementação no Início:** Pode ser mais simples logisticamente, uma vez que é realizada durante a preparação do substrato. Porém, deve-se ter cuidado para não exceder a concentração de ureia que possa ser prejudicial ao micélio. - **Suplementação após Colonização:** É uma abordagem mais direcionada, possivelmente oferecendo um controle melhor sobre o estímulo à produtividade. No entanto, exige métodos assépticos para evitar a contaminação durante a injeção da solução. # Considerações Finais Independente do método escolhido, é imprescindível realizar um monitoramento rigoroso e possivelmente manter um registro detalhado das concentrações utilizadas, momentos de aplicação e respostas observadas para ajustar e otimizar o processo em ciclos futuros de cultivo. Experimentação cuidadosa e ajustes baseados em observações concretas são a chave para o sucesso no uso de suplementação com ureia no cultivo de cogumelos."},{"prompt":"cite mais 5 possiveis suplementos para serem usados","completion":"Além da ureia, existem diversos outros suplementos que podem ser incorporados aos substratos de cultivo para melhorar o crescimento e a produção de cogumelos. Aqui estão cinco suplementos amplamente utilizados pelos cultivadores de cogumelos: 1. **Farelo de Trigo:** Um dos mais comuns suplementos, o farelo de trigo é rico em nitrogênio e outros nutrientes essenciais que promovem o crescimento micelial vigoroso e podem aumentar significativamente a produção de cogumelos. A adição de farelo de trigo ao substrato geralmente varia entre 10% e 20% do peso seco do substrato. 2. **Farelo de Arroz:** Similar ao farelo de trigo, o farelo de arroz é outro suplemento rico em nutrientes que pode ser usado para enriquecer substratos de cultivo de cogumelos. Além de fornecer uma fonte adicional de nitrogênio, ele também contém uma variedade de vitaminas e minerais benéficos para o crescimento dos cogumelos. 3. **Casca de Semente de Girassol:** Utilizada como suplemento por seu conteúdo moderado de nitrogênio e alto teor de potássio e fósforo, a casca de semente de girassol pode ajudar a criar um substrato mais equilibrado nutricionalmente, favorecendo o desenvolvimento do cogumelo. 4. **Farinha de Soja:** A farinha de soja é altamente nutritiva, rica em proteínas e outros nutrientes. Sua incorporação ao substrato pode aumentar a disponibilidade de nitrogênio e outros compostos vitais, incentivando um crescimento mais rápido e possivelmente aumentando a produção de cogumelos. 5. **Gesso Agrícola (Sulfato de Cálcio):** Embora o gesso não seja uma fonte de nitrogênio ou outros macronutrientes primários, ele é frequentemente adicionado aos substratos de cultivo de cogumelos para ajudar a manter a estrutura física do substrato, prevenir o compactamento e adicionar cálcio. Isso ajuda a manter um bom nível de aeração e distribuição de água dentro do substrato, condições importantes para o crescimento do micélio e desenvolvimento dos cogumelos. A escolha do suplemento (ou combinação de suplementos) depende do tipo específico de cogumelo sendo cultivado, da composição original do substrato, e dos objetivos de cultivo. A adição de qualquer suplemento deve ser feita com cuidado e baseada em conhecimento ou experimentação prévia, pois a suplementação excessiva ou desequilibrada pode ter efeitos adversos, como inibir o crescimento ou promover a contaminação."},{"prompt":"existe algum suplemento mineral ou quimico que possa ser usado?","completion":"Sim, existem suplementos minerais e químicos que podem ser usados no cultivo de cogumelos para melhorar a nutrição do substrato, aumentar a eficiência do cultivo e potencialmente elevar a produção e qualidade dos cogumelos. No entanto, é imprescindível usar esses suplementos com cuidado, em concentrações adequadas para evitar qualquer efeito tóxico para o micélio ou para os consumidores dos cogumelos. Aqui estão alguns suplementos minerais e químicos comumente considerados no cultivo de cogumelos: 1. **Sulfato de Cálcio (Gesso)**: Como mencionado anteriormente, o gesso é usado não por seu valor nutritivo diretamente, mas para evitar o compactamento do substrato, melhorar a estrutura e a aeração, e fornecer cálcio, que é um mineral essencial para o desenvolvimento de muitas espécies de cogumelos. 2. **Sulfato de Magnésio (Sal de Epsom)**: Usado em pequenas quantidades, pode fornecer magnésio e enxofre, elementos essenciais que auxiliam no metabolismo do micélio e na formação de enzimas importantes. 3. **Carbonato de Cálcio (Cal)**: Algumas vezes adicionado para ajustar o pH do substrato, visto que o ambiente de cultivo ideal pode variar entre os tipos de cogumelos. Muitos cogumelos preferem um substrato ligeiramente alcalino, e o carbonato de cálcio pode ser usado para alcançar essa condição. 4. **Nitrato de Cálcio**: Pode ser usado como fonte de nitrogênio solúvel em água e cálcio, proporcionando nutrientes que são facilmente acessíveis para o micélio. No entanto, deve ser usado com muita cautela devido ao potencial de toxicidade e impacto no pH do substrato. 5. **Quelatos de Ferro**: Ferro é um mineral essencial para o crescimento de plantas e microrganismos, incluindo fungos. A adição de quelatos de ferro, que são formas de ferro que são mais facilmente absorvidas e utilizadas pelos organismos, pode ajudar a prevenir deficiências desse nutriente importante. É importante notar que a aplicação de qualquer suplemento mineral ou químico deve ser considerada com base nas necessidades específicas do tipo de cogumelo sendo cultivado e das características do substrato usado. Além disso, deve-se sempre considerar a possibilidade de efeitos indesejados, como alterações no pH, salinidade, ou mesmo toxicidade para o micélio ou consumidores humanos. Experimentação controlada e o ajuste fino da dosagem são fundamentais ao introduzir novos suplementos no cultivo de cogumelos. O acompanhamento cuidadoso dos efeitos desses aditivos no crescimento do micélio e na produção de cogumelos ajudará a otimizar o uso de suplementos minerais e químicos no cultivo."},{"prompt":"no caso de usar serragem pura ou pepal como substrato, o que eu poderia usar como suplemneto para frutificação e aumento de produção uma vez que os blocos ja estiverem colonizados, após as frutificações o que eu poderia usar também para continuar produzindo com os mesmo blocos","completion":"Quando se cultiva cogumelos em substratos compostos principalmente de serragem ou papel (papel triturado ou papelão, muitas vezes referido como \\"pepal\\" em alguns contextos), o suplemento correto pode ajudar a superar a baixa disponibilidade de nutrientes nesses substratos, promovendo frutificação e potencialmente aumentando a produção. Aqui estão as considerações para suplementação em duas fases como mencionado: após a colonização inicial e para promover ciclos adicionais de frutificação. # Após a Colonização Inicial Para incentivar a frutificação uma vez que os blocos estejam totalmente colonizados, você pode considerar: 1. **Suplementação com Nutrientes Nitrogenados**: Após a colonização, uma leve suplementação com fontes de nitrogênio solúvel, como ureia (em concentrações muito baixas), pode ser benéfica. No entanto, este passo tem que ser feito com cuidado para evitar qualquer dano ao micélio. 2. **Ajustes Físicos e Ambientais**: Além dos suplementos, ajustar as condições ambientais (como diminuição da temperatura, aumento da umidade, e introdução de fluxo de ar) é crucial para induzir a frutificação. # Para Continuar Produzindo com os Mesmos Blocos Após uma ou mais ondas de frutificação, os blocos podem ter esgotado parte de seus nutrientes disponíveis. Para incentivar novos ciclos de produção, considere: 1. **Suplementação com Farelo ou Farinha**: Adicionar uma camada externa de farelo de trigo ou farelo de arroz ao bloco pode fornecer os nutrientes necessários para suportar novas ondas de frutificação. Isso pode ser feito pulverizando a superfície do bloco com uma solução que contém os nutrientes dissolvidos ou aplicando uma camada fina de material seco e deixando o micélio recolonizar essa camada. 2. **Reidratação do Bloco**: Isso pode ser necessário para manter um nível adequado de umidade, essencial para o crescimento do cogumelo. Imersão do bloco em água por um curto período (até 24 horas) pode ser benéfico, seguido de drenagem adequada antes de tentar uma nova onda de frutificação. 3. **Ajuste de pH ou Adição de Carbonato de Cálcio**: Se análises ou observações sugerem que o pH do substrato está desviando do ideal para o crescimento do tipo específico de cogumelo em cultivo, ajustá-lo com aditivos como carbonato de cálcio pode ser útil. # Considerações Gerais - **Atenção às Condições de Higiene**: Ao manipular blocos já colonizados para suplementação ou reidratação, manter condições estéreis é essencial para evitar contaminação. - **Monitoramento**: Observar cuidadosamente a resposta dos cogumelos aos tratamentos de suplementação e ajustar as práticas conforme necessário. - **Experimentação**: Devido às variações entre diferentes espécies de cogumelos e até mesmo entre cepas, pode ser necessário experimentar para encontrar as melhores abordagens para a suplementação e reutilização de blocos. Sempre lembre-se de que o sucesso no cultivo de cogumelos envolve uma combinação de boa prática de cultivo, experimentação cuidadosa e observação atenta para ajustar as técnicas à medida que aprende o que funciona melhor em seu ambiente de cultivo específico."},{"prompt":"fale sobre o uso de cerveja, açucar, amido de milho e farinha de trigo. o que poderia esperar aplicando esses materias nas circustnância anteriores","completion":"Utilizar materiais como cerveja, açúcar, amido de milho e farinha de trigo no cultivo de cogumelos, especialmente no contexto de suplementação para promover a frutificação ou para incentivar novas ondas de produção em substratos já colonizados, é uma prática que busca fornecer nutrientes adicionais ao micélio. Cada um desses materiais oferece diferentes tipos de nutrientes que podem beneficiar o crescimento micelial e a produção de cogumelos, embora seu uso precise ser cuidadosamente considerado e monitorado devido ao risco de promover também o crescimento de contaminantes. Vamos explorar como cada um desses materiais pode ser usado: # Cerveja A cerveja contém açúcares fermentáveis, vitaminas do complexo B e diversos minerais, propondo-se ser um suplemento líquido nutritivo. Suas leveduras mortas (se a cerveja for pasteurizada) também podem oferecer nutrientes. A cerveja pode ser diluída em água e usada para borrifar os blocos de cogumelos para incentivar a frutificação. No entanto, é importante evitar o uso excessivo, pois o açúcar e outros componentes fermentáveis podem encorajar o crescimento de bactérias e mofo. # Açúcar O açúcar (sacarose) é uma fonte direta de energia para os fungos, mas deve ser usado com moderação. Adicionar uma pequena quantidade de sacarose ou dextrose dissolvida em água pode ajudar na frutificação, fornecendo uma fonte de energia rapidamente disponível. Mais uma vez, o controle é fundamental, visto que açúcares em excesso podem favorecer contaminantes sobre o micélio desejado. # Amido de Milho O amido de milho pode servir como um suplemento carbonáceo, gradualmente liberando açúcares simples conforme é quebrado pelo micélio. Isso pode oferecer uma fonte de energia mais sustentada. Contudo, o amido precisa ser hidrolisado (quebrado em açúcares mais simples) para ser efetivamente utilizado pelo micélio, o que pode não ocorrer eficientemente em todas as condições de cultivo. # Farinha de Trigo Similarmente ao amido de milho, a farinha de trigo pode fornecer uma fonte de carbono na forma de amidos. Além disso, a farinha de trigo contém proteínas e outros micronutrientes. Pode ser misturada em soluções para borrifar o substrato ou utilizada na formulação do substrato inicial. No entanto, assim como os amidos, os riscos de contaminação são significativos, exigindo cautela na aplicação. # Considerações e Precauções - **Risco de Contaminação:** A introdução de qualquer fonte de nutriente adicional, especialmente aquelas ricas em açúcares e amidos, aumenta significativamente o risco de contaminação por bactérias e fungos competidores. A assepsia e o controle ambiental tornam-se ainda mais críticos. - **Equilíbrio Nutricional:** O equilíbrio entre carbono e nitrogênio (C:N) no substrato é importante para o crescimento e desenvolvimento ótimos do micélio e dos cogumelos. O excesso de carbono fácil de metabolizar pode desbalancear esse equilíbrio. - **Experimentação Cautelosa:** Devido às variáveis envolvidas e à possibilidade de resultados adversos, qualquer suplementação deve ser abordada experimentalmente em pequena escala antes de implementações mais amplas. Em resumo, enquanto cerveja, açúcar, amido de milho e farinha de trigo têm potencial para fornecer nutrientes adicionais e estimular o crescimento e a produção de cogumelos em substratos colonizados, seu uso requer cautela, monitoramento rigoroso e um manejo cuidadoso para equilibrar benefícios e riscos, principalmente o risco aumentado de contaminação."},{"prompt":"qual seria o mais viável e benefico com resultados mais satisfatórios","completion":"Dentre as opções mencionadas (cerveja, açúcar, amido de milho, e farinha de trigo) para suplementar substratos de cogumelos já colonizados, cada uma tem potenciais benefícios e desafios, mas considerando uma combinação de viabilidade, redução de risco de contaminação, e potencial para resultados satisfatórios, a utilização de açúcar (em uma forma muito diluída) pode oferecer um método vantajoso e relativamente menos arriscado para estimular a frutificação em ciclos de produção subsequentes. # Por Que Açúcar? - **Disponibilidade e Custo:** O açúcar é amplamente disponível e de custo relativamente baixo, tornando-se um suplemento acessível para a maioria dos cultivadores. - **Simplicidade de Uso:** Pode ser facilmente dissolvido em água, facilitando a aplicação uniforme sobre os blocos de substrato ou através de sistemas de irrigação, sem necessidade de preparação adicional. - **Fonte Direta de Energia:** O açúcar fornece uma fonte de energia prontamente disponível para o micélio, que pode ser útil particularmente após um ciclo de frutificação, quando o substrato pode estar parcialmente esgotado de nutrientes facilmente acessíveis. # Considerações ao Usar Açúcar - **Concentração:** Uma solução de açúcar muito concentrada pode não apenas fomentar a contaminação, mas também criar um ambiente hipertônico que poderia desidratar o micélio. Uma solução muito diluída (ex.: 1-2% de açúcar) minimiza esses riscos. - **Aplicação:** A aplicação deve ser feita de maneira controlada e uniforme. Uma pulverização leve e distribuída uniformemente é geralmente preferível a uma aplicação pesada, que pode saturar o substrato e criar condições propícias para contaminação. - **Monitoramento de Resultados:** É crucial observar a resposta dos cogumelos à suplementação com açúcar e ajustar a concentração ou a frequência da aplicação conforme necessário. # Alternativa - Farelo de Trigo Além dessas opções, o farelo de trigo é outro suplemento que, embora não mencionado especificamente na pergunta anterior, tem sido amplamente demonstrado como benéfico para aumentar a produtividade em substratos de cultivo de cogumelos, fornecendo tanto uma fonte de nitrogênio quanto de carbono. Seu uso seria mais no início do processo de cultivo, como um suplemento misturado ao substrato, mas é importante destacar devido à sua eficácia documentada. # Linha de Fundo A escolha do suplemento e da técnica de aplicação deve ser feita com consideração cuidadosa das condições específicas de cultivo, inclusive a espécie de cogumelo, o tipo de substrato, e o sistema de cultivo usado. Embora o açúcar em solução diluída possa ser uma opção viável para estimular uma produção adicional, a experimentação controlada e o ajuste baseado em observações serão essenciais para otimizar os resultados. Sempre comece com aplicações pequenas e aumente gradualmente com base nas respostas observadas para encontrar o equilíbrio correto para sua operação de cultivo específica."},{"prompt":"cite mais 5 alternativas para essa suplementação seguindo o raciocínio anterior que tenham efeitos imediatos e sejam materiais acessíveis em casa","completion":"Com base na necessidade de suplementos que sejam acessíveis, possam ser utilizados em casa, e tenham efeitos imediatos no cultivo de cogumelos, aqui estão cinco alternativas de suplementação: 1. **Mel**: Similar ao açúcar, o mel pode ser usado como uma fonte direta de energia para o micélio, fornecendo glicose e frutose facilmente assimiláveis. Além disso, o mel possui propriedades antimicrobianas naturais que podem ajudar a mitigar o risco de contaminação, desde que seja utilizado em uma diluição adequada (ex.: 1% de concentração em água) e aplicado com moderação. 2. **Café**: O uso de café, tanto o líquido restante de seu preparo quanto os grãos usados, pode ser benéfico. O café é rico em nitrogênio e outros nutrientes. Os grãos de café usados podem ser misturados diretamente ao substrato ou o líquido diluído pode ser utilizado para umedecer o substrato. Isso não apenas fornece nutrientes mas também pode acidificar ligeiramente o substrato, o que é preferível para algumas espécies de cogumelos. 3. **Casca de Ovo**: Rica em cálcio, a casca de ovo moída pode ser usada para adicionar cálcio ao substrato, o que é benéfico para o crescimento do cogumelo. O cálcio tem um papel importante na estrutura das paredes celulares dos cogumelos e pode ajudar a prevenir a acidificação excessiva do substrato. A casca deve ser moída até virar pó e espalhada ou misturada ao substrato de forma muito leve. 4. **Chá Verde**: Restos de chá verde ou o líquido de chá verde podem fornecer antioxidantes e uma pequena quantidade de nutrientes, além de possuir propriedades antibacterianas ligeiras. Pode ser usado para borrifar o substrato, semelhante ao uso de soluções de açúcar ou mel, contudo, em uma concentração muito diluída para evitar o excesso de umidade. 5. **Banana e Cascas de Frutas**: Cascas de banana e outras frutas podem ser secas, moídas e adicionadas ao substrato em quantidades muito pequenas. São ricas em potássio e outros minerais, além de oferecerem açúcares residuais. Devido ao seu alto conteúdo de nutrientes e açúcares, devem ser usadas com grande cuidado para evitar o excesso de umidade e contaminação. # Considerações Importantes - **Risco de Contaminação**: Introduzir qualquer suplemento orgânico no cultivo de cogumelos aumenta o risco de contaminação por bactérias e fungos competidores. Portanto, qualquer suplementação deve ser aplicada com cautela, em pequenas quantidades, e com atenção ao controle de umidade e limpeza do ambiente de cultivo. - **Experimentação e Ajuste Gradual**: Comece com pequenas quantidades desses suplementos e observe a resposta do micélio e a produção de cogumelos. Ajuste a quantidade e a frequência de aplicação conforme necessário, com base nos resultados observados. - **Considere as Especificidades das Espécies**: Diferentes espécies de cogumelos têm diferentes requisitos nutricionais e tolerâncias ambientais. A suplementação que beneficia uma espécie pode não ser ideal para outra. Lembrando que, ao experimentar com esses ou quaisquer outros suplementos, o monitoramento cuidadoso e a higiene são fundamentais para garantir o sucesso do cultivo e a segurança dos cogumelos produzidos."},{"prompt":"o que pode acontecer se o substrato de grama não estuiver bem seco?","completion":"Utilizar um substrato de grama que não esteja bem seco para o cultivo de cogumelos pode apresentar vários problemas que afetam tanto o processo de cultivo quanto a saúde dos cogumelos e do próprio cultivador. Aqui estão algumas consequências potenciais: # Contaminação - **Crescimento de Microrganismos Nocivos:** Umidade excessiva em substratos como a grama favorece o crescimento de bactérias e fungos competidores, que podem superar ou inibir o crescimento do micélio do cogumelo desejado. Esses microrganismos nocivos também podem produzir substâncias tóxicas que prejudicam o crescimento dos cogumelos ou tornam-nos inseguros para consumo. - **Formação de Bolores:** A presença de umidade facilita o estabelecimento de colônias de bolor, que não apenas competem com o micélio por espaço e nutrientes, mas também podem causar a decomposição do substrato, reduzindo sua qualidade e utilidade. # Problemas no Desenvolvimento dos Cogumelos - **Crescimento Lento ou Inibido:** Substratos excessivamente úmidos podem criar condições anaeróbias (falta de oxigênio) que dificultam o desenvolvimento adequado do micélio. Isso pode resultar em crescimento lento, frutificação pobre ou até falha completa na colonização do substrato. - **Produção Reduzida:** Mesmo que alguns micélios consigam colonizar substratos úmidos, a eficiência da produção de corpos de fruto pode ser significativamente diminuída, resultando em menos cogumelos e/ou cogumelos de menor qualidade. # Redução da Qualidade do Substrato - **Decomposição Acelerada:** Um substrato úmido pode se decompor mais rapidamente do que o desejado, afetando negativamente sua estrutura física e a disponibilidade de nutrientes essenciais para o crescimento dos cogumelos. - **Perda de Nutrientes por Lixiviação:** Nutrientes solúveis em água podem ser lixiviados de substratos excessivamente úmidos, resultando em menor disponibilidade de nutrientes para o micélio. # Riscos à Saúde - **Produção de Substâncias Tóxicas:** Além dos microrganismos mencionados, substratos não adequados e mal conservados podem promover o desenvolvimento de patógenos que produzem toxinas. Essas substâncias podem tornar os cogumelos cultivados inseguros para o consumo. Para evitar esses problemas, é crucial assegurar que o substrato de grama esteja bem seco antes de usá-lo para o cultivo de cogumelos. Além disso, a umidade do substrato deve ser cuidadosamente controlada durante todo o processo de cultivo, mantendo um equilíbrio que apoie o crescimento saudável do micélio e a produção eficiente de cogumelos sem promover a contaminação ou decomposição do substrato."},{"prompt":"no processo de colonização do substrato o que ocorre quimicamente? qual seria os nutrientes importantes que o micelio transforma e usa como alimento","completion":"Durante o processo de colonização do substrato pelo micélio de cogumelos, ocorrem diversas reações bioquímicas que permitem ao fungo usar o substrato como fonte de energia e nutrientes. Este processo é complexo e envolve várias etapas de decomposição e assimilação de compostos presentes no substrato. Abaixo, são destacados os principais nutrientes e transformações químicas envolvidas: # Decomposição de Polímeros Complexos A maioria dos cogumelos cultivados são saprófitos, o que significa que eles obtêm nutrientes através da decomposição de matéria orgânica morta. Eles secretam enzimas extracelulares que quebram polímeros complexos em compostos menores, que podem ser absorvidos pelo micélio. 1. **Celulose e Hemicelulose**: São polissacarídeos presentes em muitos substratos baseados em plantas como serragem, palha e papel. As enzimas celulases e hemicelulases quebram esses compostos em açúcares mais simples, como glucose, que são facilmente assimilados pelo fungo. 2. **Lignina**: Um complexo polímero aromático que confere rigidez e impermeabilidade às paredes celulares das plantas. Embora seja mais difícil de degradar, alguns fungos produzem enzimas ligninolíticas que quebram a lignina, liberando compostos fenólicos e aumentando a acessibilidade da celulose e hemicelulose. 3. **Proteínas**: As proteínas presentes no substrato são decompostas por proteases em aminoácidos, que são absorvidos e utilizados tanto para a síntese de novas proteínas pelo fungo quanto como fonte de nitrogênio. 4. **Gorduras e Óleos**: Os lipídios são hidrolisados pelas lipases em ácidos graxos e glicerol, que podem ser utilizados pelo micélio como fonte de energia e para a construção de estruturas celulares. # Nutrientes Importantes - **Nitrogênio**: Essencial para a síntese de aminoácidos, DNA, RNA e enzimas. Pode ser obtido de proteínas no substrato ou de fontes inorgânicas como nitratos ou amônia adicionados ao substrato. - **Carbono**: Principal fonte de energia, geralmente obtido a partir da decomposição de carboidratos como celulose e açúcares. - **Fósforo**: Importante para a transferência de energia (ATP) e constituinte de ácidos nucleicos e membranas celulares. - **Sulfur e Magnésio**: Essenciais para a produção de aminoácidos sulfurados e clorofila, respectivamente, além de participarem em várias funções enzimáticas e metabólicas. - **Vitaminas**: Diversas vitaminas, especialmente as do complexo B, são importantes para o metabolismo energético e devem estar presentes ou serem adicionadas ao substrato para garantir um crescimento ótimo. # Transformações Químicas O processo de colonização do substrato por micélio é fundamentalmente um processo de catabolismo e anabolismo: compostos complexos são quebrados em partes menores que podem ser assimiladas (catabolismo), e estas moléculas menores são utilizadas para construir as estruturas celulares do fungo e realizar suas funções vitais (anabolismo). A eficiência com que um fungo consegue realizar essas transformações químicas depende grandemente do tipo de substrato utilizado, das condições de cultivo (como umidade e temperatura), e das espécies específicas de cogumelos, uma vez que diferentes espécies produzem diferentes tipos e quantidades de enzimas digestivas."},{"prompt":"existe alguma intervenção que o produtor possa fazer para introduzir os elementos necessários para um boa frutificação de produção e quais seriam eles e como eles devem ser usados","completion":"Para maximizar a frutificação e a produção de cogumelos, os produtores podem adotar diversas estratégias de intervenção que envolvem a introdução de elementos nutricionais, ajustes nas condições ambientais e manejo adequado do cultivo. As intervenções nutricionais visam fornecer os micronutrientes e macronutrientes essenciais de que os cogumelos necessitam para um crescimento saudável e uma produção abundante. Aqui estão algumas abordagens e como elas podem ser implementadas: # 1. **Suplementação do Substrato** - **Nitrogênio:** Elemento crítico para o crescimento. Pode ser adicionado na forma de farelos (farelo de trigo, farelo de arroz) que são ricos em proteínas, oferecendo assim uma boa fonte de nitrogênio. Geralmente, esses farelos são misturados ao substrato antes da esterilização/ pasteurização. A proporção comum varia de 5% a 20% do peso seco do substrato, dependendo da espécie de cogumelo. - **Gesso (Sulfato de Cálcio):** Utilizado para evitar o compactamento do substrato e melhorar sua estrutura, permitindo a troca de gases e facilitando o crescimento do micélio. É adicionado ao substrato em uma proporção de cerca de 2%-5% do peso seco do substrato. - **Cal (Carbonato de Cálcio):** Ajuda a ajustar o pH do substrato para níveis mais alcalinos, o que pode ser benéfico para algumas espécies de cogumelos. O uso deve ser cauteloso, baseando-se nos requerimentos específicos de pH de cada espécie. # 2. **Controle Ambiental para Indução da Frutificação** Após a colonização completa do substrato pelo micélio, ajustes nas condições ambientais são necessários para induzir a frutificação: - **Temperatura:** Uma leve queda na temperatura é frequentemente necessária para induzir a frutificação em muitas espécies de cogumelos. - **Umidade:** Aumentar a umidade do ar próximo a 90%-95% é crucial para a indução da frutificação e o desenvolvimento dos corpos de fruto. - **Troca de Gás/Ventilação:** Introduzindo trocas de ar fresco, reduzindo assim o CO2 acumulado no ambiente de cultivo, estimula a frutificação. - **Iluminação:** Embora os cogumelos não realizem fotossíntese, muitas espécies requerem luz indireta para desencadear a formação de corpos de fruto. # 3. **Aditivos Específicos e Micronutrientes** - **Solúções de Micronutrientes:** Podem ser aplicadas pulverizando-se soluções diluídas contendo minerais essenciais como magnésio, ferro, etc., que são importantes para o crescimento do fungo. - **Açúcares e Melasses:** Para algumas técnicas avançadas, a adição de uma solução diluída de açúcares (como dextrose) pode fornecer energia extra para o micélio. No entanto, o uso de açúcares requer cautela, pois pode aumentar o risco de contaminação. # Como Usar - Na preparação do substrato, misture os aditivos nutricionais de maneira uniforme para garantir que o micélio tenha acesso consistente aos nutrientes em todo o bloco ou saco de cultivo. - Implemente controles ambientais usando equipamentos de cultivo como umidificadores, dispositivos de controle de temperatura e sistemas de ventilação para manter as condições ideais. - Aplique soluções de micronutrientes ou açúcares após a completa colonização do substrato pelo micélio, usando uma pulverização fina para evitar saturação e contaminação. Cada intervenção deve ser cuidadosamente considerada e adaptada à espécie específica de cogumelo sendo cultivada, pois diferentes espécies têm diferentes requisitos de nutrientes e condições ambientais para a frutificação. Experimentação e ajuste com base na observação dos resultados são fundamentais para otimizar as práticas de cultivo e maximizar a produção."},{"prompt":"me fale como eu poderia usar uréia ou nitrato de calcio como suplemtno para shimeji branco usando serragem como substrato, qual seria a proporção ideal por peso do substrato, qual seria mais vantajoso","completion":"Tanto a uréia quanto o nitrato de cálcio são utilizados no cultivo de cogumelos, incluindo o shimeji branco, como fontes de nitrogênio para enriquecer o substrato e melhorar a produtividade. A escolha entre um e outro dependerá de várias considerações, incluindo os objetivos do cultivo, disponibilidade dos suplementos e possíveis impactos ambientais. Vamos explorar como cada um pode ser utilizado, a proporção ideal por peso do substrato e qual pode ser mais vantajoso. # Uso de Uréia A uréia é uma fonte de nitrogênio orgânico de liberação relativamente rápida. No entanto, ao ser decomposta, eleva a concentração de amônia, o que pode ser prejudicial se não controlado. **Proporção Ideal:** Para o cultivo de cogumelos, recomenda-se uma aplicação conservadora. Uma taxa de 0,5% a 1% em relação ao peso seco do substrato é frequentemente sugerida. Isso significa adicionar de 5 a 10 gramas de uréia por cada quilograma de substrato seco. # Uso de Nitrato de Cálcio O nitrato de cálcio fornece nitrogênio na forma nítrica, que é prontamente disponível para o micélio, além de fornecer cálcio, que pode beneficiar a estrutura dos cogumelos e a qualidade do substrato. **Proporção Ideal:** Uma taxa segura pode variar de 0,5% a 1,5%, dependendo da composição do substrato e das necessidades específicas do shimeji branco. Isso implica em adicionar de 5 a 15 gramas de nitrato de cálcio por quilograma de substrato seco. # Qual Escolher? - **Vantagens da Uréia:** Barata e prontamente disponível, a uréia oferece uma concentração de nitrogênio elevada. Pode ser boa para produtores que buscam uma solução de baixo custo e estão preparados para gerenciar potenciais problemas de amônia. - **Vantagens do Nitrato de Cálcio:** Além de fornecer nitrogênio, também suplementa o cultivo com cálcio, que pode melhorar a qualidade dos corpos de fruto e do substrato. Podem ser menores os riscos de toxicidade por amônia, o que pode fazer do nitrato de cálcio uma opção mais segura e benéfica a longo prazo. # Considerações Gerais - **Monitoramento do pH:** Ambos os aditivos influenciam o pH do substrato. A uréia pode elevar o pH ao ser decomposta, enquanto o nitrato de cálcio pode ter um efeito moderado de redução do pH. Monitorar e ajustar o pH do substrato conforme necessário é essencial para otimizar o crescimento do micélio. - **Risco de Contaminação:** O excesso de nitrogênio pode promover o crescimento de competidores e patógenos. A aplicação deve ser cuidadosamente controlada. - **Testes Preliminares:** É recomendável realizar testes em pequena escala antes de aplicar qualquer suplemento em grande escala, para determinar a eficácia e possíveis efeitos adversos na produção específica. Em resumo, a escolha entre uréia e nitrato de cálcio como suplemento para o cultivo de shimeji branco em serragem depende das condições específicas de cultivo, objetivos do produtor, e da capacidade de monitorar e ajustar o ambiente do cultivo. Ambas as opções têm potencial para melhorar a produção, mas o manejo cuidadoso e a monitorização são fundamentais para alcançar os resultados desejados."},{"prompt":"Quiero que mejores la escritura de el siguiente texto pero también que lo resumas o hagas un poco mas corto: Chaqueta: Una chaqueta de tono marrón claro, con mangas largas y cuello abierto.

Generally, a soft rejection implies that while the current submission, application, or request is not being accepted as is, there might be an opportunity for improvement, further negotiation, or resubmission after certain criteria are met. It indicates that the door isn't completely closed. In the context of manuscript or article submission, a soft rejection could mean that the editors or reviewers see potential in your work but believe it requires significant revisions or adjustments before it can be accepted. They may provide feedback or suggest areas for improvement, giving you the opportunity to resubmit. For job applications, a soft rejection might occur after an interview where the employer decides not to offer you the position at this time but suggests applying for future openings or maintaining contact. In project proposals or funding applications, a soft rejection might suggest that while your project has merit, it doesn’t fit the current priorities, budget, or requirements. However, you might be encouraged to refine your proposal and try again in a future round or with a different funder. Soft rejections are not necessarily final. They often provide a unique opportunity for learning, improvement, and re-engagement. The key is to carefully review any feedback provided, understand the reasons behind the soft rejection, and address those areas effectively before resubmitting or reapplying."},{"prompt":"As in crush","completion":"If you're referring to a \\"soft rejection\\" in the context of interpersonal relationships or expressing interest in someone who might be considered a crush, the concept is similar in that it's not always entirely final, but it does require careful consideration of the other person's feelings and boundaries. A soft rejection in this context might occur if someone gently declines your advances or expresses that they're not interested in a romantic relationship at the moment, but they do so in a way that leaves room for some ambiguity. This can be their way of trying to preserve the other person's feelings or because they're unsure about their own feelings. It's different from a hard rejection, which is more direct and leaves little doubt about the person's lack of interest. Here are a few key points to consider following a soft rejection in a romantic context: 1. **Respect Their Feelings**: It's important to respect the other person's feelings and decision. Pushing them for a different answer or ignoring their response is unlikely to lead to a positive outcome and can strain the relationship. 2. **Understand Boundaries**: Even if it's a soft rejection, understand that boundaries have been set. It's essential to respect these boundaries and not overstep them in hopes of a different response in the future. 3. **Communication is Key**: If the relationship allows for it, and it's appropriate, having an open and honest conversation can be helpful. Understanding why they feel the way they do can bring clarity, though it's crucial to approach such discussions sensitively and without expectation. 4. **Self-reflection**: Use this as an opportunity to reflect on your own feelings and expectations. Consider if waiting or hoping for a change in the situation is truly in your best interest or if it might be healthier to move on. 5. **Growth and Moving On**: Soft rejections can be emotionally challenging, but they can also be an opportunity for personal growth. It may be beneficial to focus on your own development and to remain open to other possibilities and relationships. In summary, a soft rejection in the context of a crush is not invariably final, but it is a clear indicator of the current stance of the other person. It's a sign to proceed with caution and respect, keeping in mind that the dynamic can evolve over time, but changes should not be forcibly pursued or anticipated."},{"prompt":"Create interconnected generational characters in a neighbourhood with lots of drama and tragedy that would be in a soap opera.

However, I can provide you with a generalized overview of what features and specifications a TV from that period, specifically a Hitachi model, would likely have had: 1. **CRT Technology**: The TV would have used Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) technology. This was the standard for televisions until the early 2000s when flat-screen technologies started to become more common. 2. **Screen Size**: The screen size would be 21 inches diagonally. Note that due to the CRT technology, the actual viewing area might be slightly smaller because of the bezel and curvature of the glass. 3. **Mono or Stereo Sound**: Depending on the model, it might have had mono sound, which was common in the early '80s. However, by the mid-to-late '80s, more models started to incorporate stereo sound as a feature. 4. **Analog Tuner**: The TV would have had an analog tuner, as digital television (DTV) broadcasts were not introduced until much later. It would have been capable of receiving over-the-air broadcasts in the VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) bands. 5. **Inputs and Outputs**: Common inputs would have included an RF coaxial input for antenna or cable and possibly composite video and audio inputs (RCA connectors) for connecting VCRs or video game consoles. Very high-end models might have had an S-video input, but this was not common until later. 6. **Channel Presets**: It would likely have featured a push-button or rotary dial for channel selection, with later models incorporating electronic presets that allowed users to save favorite channels. 7. **Remote Control**: Remote controls were common by the mid-'80s, but the functions were basic by today's standards, including power, volume, channel switching, and possibly a mute button. 8. **Cabinet Design**: The exterior would typically be a plastic casing, with woodgrain finishes being popular in earlier models. The overall design would have been bulkier compared to modern TVs, due to the depth required by the CRT. 9. **No Built-in Teletext**: While some TVs in Europe and other regions started to incorporate teletext capabilities by the mid-'80s, it was less common in models sold in other parts of the world. 10. **Energy Consumption**: Generally, these TVs were not as energy efficient as modern televisions, partly due to the technology used and the lack of energy-saving features like automatic shutoff. Without the specific model number, it's difficult to provide more precise specifications. However, this overview should give a good sense of what a 21-inch Hitachi TV from 1986 might have offered. If you're interested in specifics, like the model number, I recommend consulting vintage electronics forums, collector websites, or even old user manuals if they can be found online."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[전태국도 대학에 들어갔겠군….] 전태국이 하버드에 들어올 일은 절대 없었다. 띵. 엘리베이터가 스위트룸 객실이 있는 꼭대기 층에 멈춰 섰다. 그리고 드디어 스위트룸의 문이 열렸다. 나를 맞이한 건 양 비서였다. “성국아….” 양 비서는 성장한 나의 모습에 감탄하고 있는 게 분명했다. “성국아, 아니 이제 정말 다 컸구나….” “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “나 기억하니?” “네.” 나는 짧게 대답했다. 양 비서의 얼굴이 펴지면서 나를 안으로 인도했다. “들어가자. 기다리고 계셔.” “네.” 너무나도 익숙한 이곳. 바로 내가 죽은 곳이었다. * * * 전재형 회장 역시 감탄하고 있었다. 나는 일부러 엄마와 같이 가서 샀던 청바지에 후드를 입고 있었다. 덕분에 좀 더 대학생 같아 보였지만, 겨우 열세 살에 불과했다. “성국아, 정말 많이 컸구나.” “안녕하세요. 오랜만에 뵙겠습니다.” 나는 깍듯하게 인사했다. 전재형 회장의 왼편에는 전태국이 뭐 씹은 얼굴로 앉아 있었다. 일어나지도 않았다. 전재형 회장이 얼른 전태국을 소개했다. “내 아들, 태국이는 기억하기 힘들지?” “안녕하세요, 전성국입니다.” [물론 다 기억하지. 저 재수 없는 얼굴과 태도 보게나. 여전하네….] 하지만 난 모른 척 인사를 했다. “아, 네가 전성국이구나.” “태국아, 제대로 인사를 해야지.” 그제야 전태국은 자리에서 일어나 겨우 인사를 했다. “반가워, 난 전태국이야.” “자, 성국아. 편하게 앉으렴.” 나는 두 사람을 마주하고 앉았다. 마치 면접을 보는 듯한 느낌이었다. “아직도 우리 호텔 짜장면 좋아하니?” “네… 엄청 좋아합니다.” “성국아, 올해 네가 몇 살이지?” “한국 나이로 열세 살이요.” “키가 도대체 몇이니?” “정확히 안 재봐서 모르겠는데요. 170은 넘는 것 같아요.” 전태국은 여전히 나를 못마땅한 눈으로 쳐다봤다. 열아홉 살이면 이제 성장도 다 멈췄을 텐데, 키도 나보다 조금 더 커 보였다. 거기다 외모는 더는 말하지 않겠다. 전태국은 전재형과 철의 여인의 단점만 아주 쏙 빼닮았다. “성국아, 늦었지만 하버드 입학한 거 축하한다.” 그 말에 전태국의 미간이 구겨지는 게 보였다. “감사합니다.” 전재형 회장은 전태국을 보며 애써 미소를 지었다. “태국아, 성국이도 이번에 대학생이 됐어. 필립 아카데미 알지? 거기도 우수한 성적으로 졸업하고, 하버드에 입학했다고 하는구나. 너랑 같은 대학생이야.” “뭐라고요? 대학생이라고요? 저 꼬맹이가요?” [꼬맹이 아니지. 나 너랑 키 차이 별로 안 나, 전태국.] 전태국에게 내 정보는 하나도 들어가지 않은 모양이다. “그래, 성국이는 효진 그룹에서 후원하는 장학생이거든. 필립 아카데미도 우수한 성적으로 들어갔다고 들었는데, 하버드까지 한 번에 가다니, 정말 구수영 회장님께서 인재를 제대로 알아보셨어.” “아직 공부할 게 많습니다.” 나는 최대한 겸손한 척을 했다. 전재형 부회장의 전태국 소개가 이어졌다. “태국이는 이번에 유타주에 있는 대학에 들어가. 멀지만, 종종 서로 연락하고 지내렴. 태국이가 미국에서 오래 생활해서 성국이한테 도움이 많이 될 거야.” “잘 부탁드려요. 참, 제가 개발한 SNS가 있는데 가입하실래요?” 슬슬 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 소개할 타이밍이었다. 전재형 회장은 아마 이 소식도 이미 알고 있을 터였다. “빌 게이트가 사려고 했다는 SNS가 그거니?” “네. 뉴욕에 있는 사모펀드에서도 관심을 보였는데, 조건이 열악해서 거부했어요. 대학 들어가서 좀 더 활성화시킨 다음에 사업화 진행하려고요.” “나도 가입할 수 있니?” 전재형 회장은 분명한 관심을 보였다. “회장님은 다음에 일반인들 상대로 베타서비스 진행할 때 가입해 주세요. 삼전 그룹 회장님이 가입했다면 한국에서도 엄청 홍보될 거 같아요.” “그러지. 태국아, 너라도 가입하렴. 양 비서, 노트북 좀 가져다줘.” “네, 회장님.” 곧 양 비서가 노트북을 가지고 왔다. 나는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 사이트를 불러와서 전태국에게 가입 절차를 알려줬다. 그때, 전태국의 얼굴이 조금 밝아졌다. “어, 이거. 우리 학교에서도 가입한 애들 좀 있던데….” ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 필립 아카데미를 중심으로 동부 보딩스쿨 학생들이 꽤 많이 가입했다. “태국아, 너도 들어봤어?” “우리 학교 애들도 해요. 근데… 이거 진짜 니가 개발한 거야?” “저랑 마크라고 제 룸메이트랑 둘이서 개발했어요. 저는 아이디어를 내고, 마크가 프로그램을 짰어요. 태국이 형, 여기 가입 절차에 따라서 가입해 보세요.” 전태국은 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 가입을 하고는 제일 먼저 나에게 친구 신청을 했다. “너 친구 진짜 많다.” “제가 개발자잖아요.” “대박. 너 프롬킹이었어?” “네.” 전태국의 태도가 조금씩 호의적으로 변했다. 전재형 회장이 흥미롭게 우리 둘을 살폈다. “성국이가 미국에서도 인기 많았구나.” “전 공부만 해서 잘 몰라요. 그냥 운 좋게 된 거 같아요.” “와, 이 여자애 진짜 이쁘다. 성국아, 네 친구야?” 전태국은 제시를 가리켰다. “네.” “나 얘 좀 소개시켜 주면 안 돼?” [이런 한심한 놈 같으니라고. 대체 머릿속에 뭐만 차 있는 거야?] 나는 어금니를 꽉 물고 미소를 지었다. “말은 해볼게요.” “얘 학교 어디 갔어?” “저랑 같은 하버드요.” “집은 잘살아?” “아버지가 유명한 사모펀드 대표세요.” [이런 수준 낮은 질문에 대답해야 하나.] 피로감이 쏟아졌다. “식사 다 준비됐습니다.” “태국아, 가입했지?” “네, 아빠.” “집에 가서 천천히 보고, 오늘은 성국이랑 이런저런 이야기 하자꾸나.” 전태국은 아쉬운 듯 노트북을 덮었다. “성국아, 저 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 직접 창업할 생각이니? 아니면 키워서 팔 생각이니?” “직접 창업하려고요.” 난 자신 있게 대답했다. ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 앞으로 삼전 그룹을 초월하는 회사가 된다. 삼전 그룹이야 대한민국의 재벌이지만, ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 세계의 재벌이다. “창업, 어려울 텐데….” “전 원래 가난하게 태어났잖아요. 원래 부자로 태어나면 조금의 결핍만 생겨도 힘들지만, 저는 어릴 적에 많이 단련했거든요.” “가난이 자랑은 아니잖아?” 전태국이 비꼬듯 물었다. “자랑은 아니지만, 부끄러운 것도 아니라고 생각해요.” “게으른 사람이 가난한 거잖아.” “재벌들은 부지런해서 재벌이 된 거 아니잖아요. 그렇게 태어난 거지.” 내 말에 전태국은 입술을 삐죽 내밀었다. 더 할 말이 없다는 얼굴이었다. 전재형 회장이 화제를 돌렸다. “성국아, 그럼 저 회사에 투자는 언제부터 받을 거니?” “좀 더 키워보고요.” “어려우면 나한테 연락해줘. 내가 도움이 될 수 있으면 도와주고 싶구나.” [어디 다 차려진 밥상에 숟가락을 얹으려고.] 나는 최대한 아닌 척 미소 지었다. “필요하면 연락드릴게요.” “아빠, 우리도 저런 SNS 하나 개발하자. 성국이도 했는데, 삼전이 못 할 리가 없잖아.” [아마 못 할 텐데…. 짜장면이나 먹어야겠다.] 전태국은 계속해서 어린아이처럼 칭얼거렸다. 아무래도 내가 가진 게 갖고 싶은 모양이었다. 이때, 전재형 회장이 전태국을 차분한 목소리로 불렀다. “태국아…. 넌 굳이 공부를 잘할 필요도 없고, 굳이 좋은 학교를 갈 필요도 없어.” 뭐지? 나는 짜장면을 먹으면서 신경을 곤두세웠다. “아빠, 무슨 말이야?” “넌 사람을 잘 부리는 방법만 알면 되는 거야. 네가 가진 회사와 재산은 누구도 넘볼 수 없어. 삼전 그룹은 영원할 테니까. 그렇다면 너는 네가 가진 것을 지키면서 그 재산을 불릴 똑똑한 이들을 그저 잘 부리면 되는 거야. 그 사람들은 절대 가질 수 없는 자본을 너는 가졌잖니….” 잠시 정적이 흘렀다. 나는 오늘 전재형 회장이 나를 초대한 이유를 알 것 같았다. 지금 그는 아들 전태국을 훈련시키고 있었다. 나보다 공부도 못하고, 얼굴도 못생겼고, 성격도 더럽다. 하지만 그는 삼전 그룹의 후계자이다. 전재형 회장의 말대로 그는 모든 것을 가지고 태어났으니, 그 자본으로 나처럼 똑똑한 사람을 잘 발탁해서 쓰면 된다는 말이었다. 전재형 회장은 나를 보는 것 같았지만, 나는 고개를 숙이고 짜장면을 흡입했다. 그리고 입을 닦았다. “성국아, 다 먹었니?” “네.” “맛있지?” “네, 역시 삼전 호텔 짜장면이 제일 맛있어요.” “그렇지. 삼전 호텔 짜장면만큼 맛있는 건 없지. 주방장이 나간다고 해도, 삼전 호텔 짜장면은 언제나 똑같을 거야.” 나는 전재형 회장의 말을 곰곰이 생각했다. 이곳의 주방장은 언제나 대한민국 최고 연봉을 받고 있다. 주방장은 대부분 어렵게 나가서 개업을 할 생각조차 안 한다. 왜냐하면 개업해서 버는 돈보다 이곳의 연봉이 더 많으니까. 하지만 주방장 곁에서 같이 일하던 젊은 다른 셰프가 주방장과 비슷한 맛을 낼 수 있게 되면 주방장은 하루아침에 잘리고, 젊은 셰프로 교체가 된다. 주방장은 그제야 개업을 할 생각을 하지만, 그는 개업하기에는 이미 나이를 너무 많이 먹어 버렸다. 삼전이 사람을 쓰고 버리는 방식이었다. 그리고 이번 생에서 내가 삼전을 떠난 이유이기도 했다. 도구가 되느니, 내가 칼이 되겠어! “성국아, 하버드 간 거 진심으로 축하한다.” “감사합니다.” 나는 조용히 자리에서 일어났다. 전태국은 나를 보더니 거만한 얼굴로 인사를 했다. “성국아, 학교 열심히 다녀. 너 같은 애들이 열심히 공부하고, 열심히 일해야지 세상이 돌아가지.” 나는 이를 꽉 물었다. [전태국, 네가 물려받을 자산보다 내가 이룰 자산이 더 많아지는 날에 또 보자. 딱 10년이야. 두고 보자고. 이번 생에서는 누가 더 재벌이 될지!]","completion":"Episode 97 My mom tried to stop me. \\"Seong-guk, why the bag?\\" \\"Mom, you don't have a bag either. I'll buy it. You've had a hard time raising me and making me study.\\" \\"Oh my... My son is really a filial son. That bag, it's currently the most popular bag in our store. It's really nice to carry around anywhere. I have one myself.\\" The manager chimed in. Mom looked at me with a displeased face. \\"Seong-guk, we came to look for clothes for you to wear to school... You don't have to buy me a bag.\\" \\"Mom, if I carry that bag to my school entrance ceremony, it'll be fine.\\" \\"But... It's hard to guess your age. You still look young, are you entering high school?\\" \\"I'm entering college this year. What should I say? He skipped grades a lot, so he's entering at a much younger age than his peers.\\" \\"Oh, which school?\\" \\"Harvard.\\" Game clear. The final boss. In South Korea, that was the feeling Harvard gave. The manager was at a loss for words. \\"Harvard? The Harvard in the US?\\" \\"Yes... That's why I wanted to buy some nice clothes for him.\\" \\"Congratulations, that's really amazing.\\" The manager kept congratulating us, and my mom happily accepted. And I bought the bag. \\"Then, please recommend a wallet that would be good for boys. Seong-guk, you need a wallet too.\\" I didn't refuse the wallet. \\"Okay. Mom, this one.\\" \\"Oh my, that's the most expensive product in our store. You have a good eye.\\" [Of course, I was a chaebol in my previous life.] * * * \\"Seong-guk, do you know you bought five gray hoodies and jeans?\\" \\"Mom, I think that's enough for me.\\" \\"What are you going to wear when we go to see Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung?\\" \\"I'll wear what I bought today, what else. We're going to eat black bean noodles.\\" Our meeting was, as always, at the Chinese restaurant in the Samjeon Hotel. * * * [How many years has it been.] It would be a lie to say my heart wasn't racing. In a few seconds, my father and brother from my previous life would be sitting in the suite room of the Samjeon Hotel. Jeon Tae-guk was six years older than me, so he was the same age as Mark. [Jeon Tae-guk must have entered college by now....] Jeon Tae-guk would never have entered Harvard. Ding. The elevator stopped at the top floor where the suite rooms were. And finally, the door to the suite room opened. I was greeted by Secretary Yang. \\"Seong-guk....\\" Secretary Yang was clearly amazed at my grown appearance. \\"Seong-guk, you've really grown up....\\" \\"Hello. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Do you remember me?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I answered briefly. Secretary Yang's face brightened as he led me inside. \\"Let's go in. They're waiting.\\" \\"Yes.\\" This place was all too familiar. It was where I had died. * * * Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was also amazed. I was deliberately wearing the jeans and hoodie I bought with my mom. Thanks to that, I looked more like a college student, but I was only thirteen years old. \\"Seong-guk, you've grown a lot.\\" \\"Hello. It's been a long time since we've met.\\" I greeted him politely. Jeon Jae-hyung quickly introduced his son, Jeon Tae-guk, who was sitting with a sullen face and didn't even stand up. \\"You might find it hard to remember my son, Tae-guk?\\" \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" [Of course, I remember everything. Look at that annoying face and attitude. Still the same....] But I pretended not to know and greeted him. \\"Ah, so you're Jeon Seong-guk.\\" \\"Tae-guk, you should greet properly.\\" Only then did Jeon Tae-guk stand up and barely greeted. \\"Nice to meet you, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Seong-guk, take a seat comfortably.\\" I sat facing the two of them. It felt like an interview. \\"Do you still like our hotel's black bean noodles?\\" \\"Yes... I really like them.\\" \\"Seong-guk, how old are you this year?\\" \\"I'm thirteen years old in Korean age.\\" \\"How tall are you?\\" \\"I haven't measured exactly, but I think I'm over 170 cm.\\" Jeon Tae-guk still looked at me with displeasure. If he was nineteen, his growth would have stopped by now, but he seemed a bit taller than me. And I won't even mention his looks. Jeon Tae-guk had inherited only the worst traits of Jeon Jae-hyung and the iron lady. \\"Seong-guk, congratulations on entering Harvard, though it's late.\\" Jeon Tae-guk's brow furrowed at that. \\"Thank you.\\" Jeon Jae-hyung looked at Jeon Tae-guk and forced a smile. \\"Tae-guk, Seong-guk is also a college student now. You know Phillips Academy, right? He graduated with excellent grades and entered Harvard. He's a college student just like you.\\" \\"What? A college student? That kid?\\" [I'm not a kid. I'm almost as tall as you, Jeon Tae-guk.] Jeon Tae-guk seemed not to have absorbed any information about me. \\"Yes, Seong-guk is a scholarship student sponsored by Hyojin Group. I heard he entered Phillips Academy with excellent grades, and now Harvard, Chairman Gu Su-young really recognized a talent.\\" \\"I still have a lot to learn.\\" I tried to be as humble as possible. Jeon Jae-hyung continued to introduce Jeon Tae-guk. \\"Tae-guk is entering a university in Utah. It's far, but keep in touch with each other. Tae-guk has lived in the US for a long time, so he can be a lot of help to Seong-guk.\\" \\"Please take care of me. By the way, I developed an SNS, would you like to join?\\" It was time to introduce 'Face Paper'. Jeon Jae-hyung probably already knew about this. \\"Is that the SNS that Bill Gates wanted to buy?\\" \\"Yes. A private equity firm in New York was also interested, but the conditions were poor, so I refused. I plan to activate it more after entering college and then proceed with commercialization.\\" \\"Can I join too?\\" Jeon Jae-hyung showed clear interest. \\"Please join the beta service for the general public next time. If the chairman of Samjeon Group joins, it will be greatly promoted in Korea.\\" \\"Let's do that. Tae-guk, you join too. Secretary Yang, bring the laptop.\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" Soon, Secretary Yang brought the laptop. I opened the 'Face Paper' site and showed Jeon Tae-guk how to sign up. Then, Jeon Tae-guk's face brightened a bit. \\"Oh, this. Some kids at our school joined too....\\" 'Face Paper' had quite a few sign-ups from students at Phillips Academy and other East Coast boarding schools. \\"Tae-guk, you've heard of it?\\" \\"Our school kids do it too. But... did you really develop this?\\" \\"I developed it with Mark, my roommate. I came up with the idea, and Mark did the programming. Tae-guk hyung, please follow the sign-up process here.\\" Jeon Tae-guk signed up for 'Face Paper' and sent me a friend request first. \\"You have a lot of friends.\\" \\"I'm the developer.\\" \\"Wow, you were prom king?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Jeon Tae-guk's attitude became slightly more friendly. Jeon Jae-hyung watched us with interest. \\"Seong-guk was popular in the US too.\\" \\"I just studied, so I don't know much. I think I was just lucky.\\" \\"Wow, this girl is really pretty. Seong-guk, is she your friend?\\" Jeon Tae-guk pointed at Jessie. \\"Yes.\\" \\"Can you introduce me to her?\\" [Such a pathetic guy. What's filling your head?] I clenched my teeth and smiled. \\"I'll try talking to her.\\" \\"Which school did she go to?\\" \\"She's at Harvard with me.\\" \\"Is her family wealthy?\\" \\"Her father is a famous private equity firm CEO.\\" [Should I even answer such low-level questions.] I felt exhausted. \\"Dinner is ready.\\" \\"Tae-guk, did you sign up?\\" \\"Yes, Dad.\\" \\"Look at it at home, and let's talk with Seong-guk about various things today.\\" Jeon Tae-guk reluctantly closed the laptop. \\"Seong-guk, are you planning to start 'Face Paper' yourself? Or are you thinking of growing it and selling it?\\" \\"I'm planning to start it myself.\\" I answered confidently. 'Face Paper' will become a company that surpasses Samjeon Group. Samjeon Group may be a chaebol in South Korea, but 'Face Paper' will be a chaebol of the world. \\"Starting a business will be hard....\\" \\"I was born poor, you know. If you're born rich, even a little deprivation feels hard, but I was trained a lot when I was young.\\" \\"Poverty isn't something to be proud of.\\" \\"It's not something to be proud of, but I don't think it's something to be ashamed of either.\\" \\"Lazy people are poor.\\" \\"Not all chaebols worked hard to become chaebols. They were born into it.\\" At my words, Jeon Tae-guk pouted his lips. He had nothing more to say. Jeon Jae-hyung changed the subject. \\"Seong-guk, when will you start accepting investments for your company?\\" \\"I'll grow it a bit more.\\" \\"If it's hard, contact me. I'd like to help if I can.\\" [I see, trying to get a spoon in a ready meal.] I smiled as if it was nothing. \\"I'll contact you if needed.\\" \\"Dad, let's develop an SNS like that too. If Seong-guk can do it, Samjeon can't be unable to.\\" [I doubt you can.... Let's just eat the black bean noodles.] Jeon Tae-guk kept whining like a child. He seemed to want what I had. Then, Jeon Jae-hyung called Jeon Tae-guk in a calm voice. \\"Tae-guk.... You don't necessarily have to study well, and you don't necessarily have to go to a good school.\\" What? I focused while eating my black bean noodles. \\"Dad, what do you mean?\\" \\"You just need to know how to manage people well. The companies and wealth you have, no one can covet. Since Samjeon Group will last forever. Then, you just need to manage the smart people who can grow that wealth well with the capital you have....\\" There was a moment of silence. I felt like I understood why Jeon Jae-hyung invited me today. He was training his son, Jeon Tae-guk. He's worse at studying than me, uglier than me, and has a worse personality. But he is the heir to Samjeon Group. As Jeon Jae-hyung said, he was born with everything, so he just needs to wisely select and use smart people like me. Jeon Jae-hyung seemed to be looking at me, but I kept my head down and slurped my black bean noodles. Then, I wiped my mouth. \\"Seong-guk, did you finish?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Was it good?\\" \\"Yes, as always, Samjeon Hotel's black bean noodles are the best.\\" \\"That's right. There's nothing like Samjeon Hotel's black bean noodles. Even if the chef leaves, Samjeon Hotel's black bean noodles will always be the same.\\" I pondered over Jeon Jae-hyung's words. The chef here always receives the highest salary in South Korea. Most chefs don't even think about leaving to start their own business because the salary here is higher than what they would earn from their own business. But if a young chef working alongside the chef can produce a similar taste, the chef is replaced overnight with the younger chef. Only then does the chef think about starting his own business, but by then, he's too old. This was how Samjeon used and discarded people. And it was also the reason I left Samjeon in this life. Rather than becoming a tool, I'll become the knife! \\"Seong-guk, I sincerely congratulate you on going to Harvard.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" I quietly stood up. Jeon Tae-guk looked at me and greeted me with a haughty face. \\"Seong-guk, study hard at school. It's kids like you who need to study hard and work hard for the world to go round.\\" I clenched my teeth. [Jeon Tae-guk, let's see who becomes a bigger chaebol in 10 years. Just wait and see.

[슬슬 독립을 준비 중인가?] 마크가 뒤척이더니 나를 불렀다. “성국, 넌 한국에서도 뭐가 그렇게 바빠?” “한국 친구가 메일을 보내서….” “근데 성국아, 우리 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 말이야. 너 정말 하버드 가서 창업할 거야?” 마크의 목소리는 조금 떨리고 있었다. 아무래도 불안한 모양이었다. 우리는 마이크로 세이버사와 제시 아버지의 사모펀트 투자를 모두 거절한 상태였다. 말이 좋아서 거절이지 결론적으로는 적절한 투자자를 찾지 못한 상태이기도 했다. “아빠가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 이야기 했더니, 너무 미래가 불투명하다고 그러시는 거야. 지금이라도 마이크로 세이버사에 다시 연락을 해보는 게 어떻겠냐고.” 그러려면 나를 설득해야 할 텐데…. “이게 나 혼자 설립한 회사가 아니잖아. 거기다 우리의 계약 조항에는 각자의 지분을 서로의 합의 없이는 절대 넘길 수 없다고 되어 있잖아.” 이 조항이 평생 그의 발목을 잡을지, 마크는 아마 지금은 상상도 못 할 것이다. “마크, 네 생각은 뭔데?” “솔직히 불안해. 대학생이 되었는데, 하나도 행복하지 않아. 하버드에 들어가도 공부해서 또 사회에 나가야 하잖아. 지금 같은 마음으로서는 그냥 편하게 살고 싶기도 해.” “마크, 지금 우리가 마이크로 세이버사를 만난다고 해도 다시 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 사줄 거란 보장은 없어.” “그렇긴 하지만….” “마크, 난 준비가 되어 있어. 원래 창업은 어려운 일이잖아. 몇 달 혹은 몇 년 동안 돈을 못 벌 수도 있어. 마크, 불안하면 너한테 있는 지분 나한테 다 넘겨.” “뭐라고?” 마크가 깜짝 놀라 나를 쳐다봤다. 지금 나는 마크의 지분을 다 사겠다는 제안을 한 것이다. 판교의 땅과 주식을 다 판다면 50억 원의 재산이 있다. 물론 마이크로 세이버사가 제시하려는 금액을 정확히 알 수는 없다. 단지 내가 추측한 금액에 비해서 50억은 한참 모자란 금액일 수도 있다. 하지만 50억은 한 명의 인생을 바꾸기에는 충분한 금액이었다. “솔직히 마이크로 세이버사가 얼마를 우리에게 제시하려고 생각했는지 모르잖아. 마크, 넌 네 지분을 나한테 얼마 받고 팔고 싶어?” “그건… 생각해본 적이 없는데… 한… 200만 달러?” 25억쯤 되는 가격이다. “200만 달러면 나한테 팔래?” 나는 마크를 쳐다봤다. 솔직히 마크의 지분을 사는 것은 양날의 검이다. ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 대해서 나만큼 잘 이해하고 있는 마크와 같은 개발자를 구하는 것도 어려웠고, 프로그래밍에 있어서 마크는 천재적인 부분이 분명 있었다. 분명 나보다 천재는 아니지만. 마크가 만약 지분을 모두 나에게 넘긴다면 나는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 절대적인 소유자가 된다. ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 10년 후에 삼전 그룹 따위는 넘볼 수 없는 세계적인 기업이 된다. 그 기업의 소유주. 전재형과 전태국이 말한 그 자본의 유일한 소유주가 되는 것이다. [어려운 문제네.] 솔직히 나도 어려운 문제였다. 마크도 갈등하는 게 보였다. “성국… 만약에 넌 창업하면 어떻게 할 생각이야? 너도 알다시피 난 사람들 만나고 앞에 나서는 건 잘 못하잖아.” “마크, 그건 나한테 맡기래두.” “망하면 돈도 한 푼도 못 건지는 거잖아.” “난 각오돼 있어. 가난은 좀 불편할 뿐이야, 마크.” 마크는 한동안 말이 없었다. “성국, 좋아. 같이 창업해보자.” “그래….” [조금 아쉬운데….] 하지만 마크가 함께여야지 ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 내가 상상한 그대로 완성될 수 있었다. * * * “여기는 압구정이라고 해. 나는 어려서 잘 모르는데, 돈 많은 젊은 사람들이 오는 데야.” 경복궁을 보고 압구정으로 넘어온 우리는 압구정 거리를 걸었다. 아직 뉴욕의 거리만은 못했지만, 압구정에도 다양한 카페와 자유로운 분위기의 사람들이 많았다. “성국, 너 여기서 누구 만난다고 하지 않았어?” “어, 마크. 제시랑 둘이 커피 마시고 있지 않을래? 난 약속이 있거든.” “성국은 정말 어디 가나 사람들이 찾는다니까.” 제시가 조금 볼멘 어투로 말했다. 마크랑 단둘이 있게 된 게 불만인 것 같았다. “미안, 끝나고 여기서 제일 맛있는 떡볶이집에 가서 저녁 먹자.” 나는 마크와 제시를 카페에 데려다주고, 방무혁을 만나러 약속 장소로 향했다. 방무혁은 <저스트>를 배출하기도 한 대형 엔터테인먼트에 소속된 채 활동하고 있었다. 대형 엔터테인먼트 근처 카페로 가자 소속사 가수를 보기 위한 팬들이 꽤 많이 보였다. 방무혁은 나를 보더니 너무 놀라 인사하는 것도 까먹었다. “잘 지내셨어요?” “성국이… 그 꼬마 성국이 맞아?” “네.” 방무혁은 놀란 얼굴로 연신 내 얼굴을 살폈다. “도대체 키가 얼마야?” “170 조금 넘을 거예요.” “열세 살에?” “네.” 요즘은 성장 발육이 좋은 아이들이 많아서 열세 살 중에 나만큼 큰 아이들도 제법 있었다. “성국아, 뭐 마실래?” 커피를 외치고 싶었지만, 대한민국 나이 열세 살이므로. “딸기 스무디요.” “그래, 잠시만….” 방무혁이 딸기 스무디를 주문하는 사이에 주변에서 웅성거리는 소리가 들렸다. “야, 방무혁 작곡가가 키우는 연습생인가 봐.” “얼굴 대박. JP에서 키우는 연습생이겠지?” “근데 어딘가 낯이 익어. 쟤 이미 연습생들 사이에서 유명한 거 아니야?” “아니야. JP 연습생들 내가 다 아는데… 처음 보는 애야.” “이번에 영입하나 보다.” 방무혁이 딸기 스무디를 건넸다. “성국아, 이번에 고등학교 졸업했다는 게 진짜야?” “네.” “네 기사가 조그맣게 났더라고. 효진 그룹 장학생인 전성국 군이 이번에 하버드에 입학했다고….” 기사가 나간 모양이었다. “그 기사 보고 메일 쓴 거잖아. 성국아, 너 정말 이걸 뭐라고 해야 하지… 솔직히 너무 똑똑해서 공부하라 말라 말 못 하겠지만, 이 얼굴로 공부만 하기 진짜 아쉽다. 이거 빈말이 아니고 이번에 JP에서 연습생 모집하는데, 지원 안 해볼래?” [연예인이 얼마나 번다고.] 나는 고개를 저었다. “지금은 공부를 더 하고 싶어요. 대학도 다니고 싶고요.” “그래그래. 하버드인데, 거길 안 다니는 게 더 이상하지. 그래도 생각 있으면 연락 줘. 뭐, 경험이라는 건 다양할수록 좋잖아.” [엔터테인먼트 사업을 위해서 그럼, 연습생 한번 해볼까?] 딸기 스무디를 쪽 빨고는 방무혁을 쳐다봤다. “선생님, 저 다음 방학 때 연습생 체험 해볼 수 있을까요?”","completion":"Episode 98 \\"Mark! Jessie!\\" Mark and Jessie came out through the airport entrance. \\"Sungguk-ah!\\" Jessie quickly ran over and hugged me. \\"Was the flight okay?\\" \\"It's my first time coming this far since I was born.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, Korea is really far...\\" The flight from New York to Korea took nearly 15 hours. \\"Aren't you tired?\\" \\"Sungguk, I looked up a lot about Korea, and there seems to be a lot more to eat than I thought. I want to try street food, and things like chicken and bulgogi.\\" Mark seemed to be very interested in food. \\"Sungguk-ah, I want to see a palace. There's nothing like that in America.\\" \\"Alright. Let's go home first.\\" Together with my mom, we headed home. Mark and Jessie were amazed by the sights of Korea. \\"Wow, Korea is really a big country. There are so many cars on the road...\\" \\"There's a lot to see.\\" Mark and Jessie planned to stay in Korea for two weeks. A week after Mark and Jessie returned to the US, I will head back to the US with my family. To enroll at Harvard. * * * \\"Mark will share a room with me... and Jessie will use Jihee's room. Jihee is still young, so she sleeps with her parents.\\" \\"Really? She's five and still sleeps with her parents?\\" \\"Yeah. I used to sleep with my parents when I was young too.\\" Jessie was amazed. \\"Until what age?\\" \\"I think... until I was about seven...\\" Of course, I didn't mention the tug-of-war over my mom's affection with Minguk that happened even after that. Minguk and Jihee were initially shy around Mark and Jessie but soon became close, lightening my heart and mind. \\"Tonight's dinner is bossam made by my father's restaurant. Try it. You'll like it.\\" \\"Sure!\\" * * * My dad couldn't speak much English, but he tried his best to explain bossam to Mark and Jessie. \\"Pork boiled in our family's secret recipe. Koreans usually eat it with kimchi, but it's also delicious wrapped in pickled radish if you think it might be spicy.\\" I detailed my dad's cooking for them. Dad also prepared bulgogi, and Mark and Jessie enjoyed Korean food more than expected. Mark was satisfied with both the bossam and bulgogi. Jessie especially liked the bossam. \\"Sungguk-ah, where are you planning to take your friends tomorrow?\\" \\"Hmm... I'm thinking of going to Gyeongbokgung.\\" \\"Good, there's a delicious samgyetang restaurant nearby, so it would be nice to try that.\\" \\"I will.\\" I quickly responded. \\"Sungguk, your father's cooking is really delicious. They sell this in convenience stores in Korea?\\" \\"Yeah...\\" I nodded. \\"Sungguk, I want to check out a convenience store tonight.\\" \\"Sure.\\" I nodded at Jessie's words. * * * We headed to the convenience store in casual attire only after the sun had set. Jessie asked with a worried face. \\"Sungguk, is it okay to go out at this time?\\" \\"Yeah, don't worry. Korea is safe even at night. Of course, it can be dangerous if you wander into strange alleys or are completely drunk, but mostly it's safe.\\" Mark also looked around curiously. \\"People really walk around a lot even at night here.\\" \\"That's why 24-hour convenience stores do so well here. It's nice to come out and buy something if you're hungry late at night...\\" \\"Korea is really a nice country.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded. In my previous life, I traveled to many countries on business trips and studied abroad in the US and Japan for a long time. But to a Korean, Korea was the best. However, it was somewhat bitter to think that there's no better country to live in than Korea for those with money. Mark excitedly picked up various items. \\"Sungguk, there's so much to eat.\\" I picked up a banana milk. \\"I like this milk.\\" \\"I want to try it too.\\" Jessie and Mark also picked it up following me. We bought bread and milk and sat under a parasol in front of the convenience store. Even though it was summer, a cool breeze blew at night. \\"Sungguk, it really feels like a complete vacation.\\" Mark started eating the bread with a happy face. \\"I think I'm going to gain weight in Korea.\\" \\"Jessie will still look pretty even if she gains weight.\\" I gave Jessie some lip service to her worries. At those words, Jessie's cheeks turned red, and she just sucked on her banana milk. Mark whispered quietly. \\"Sungguk, I thought you were a Confucian boy, but you're a total flirt.\\" I just shrugged my shoulders. In my previous life, I had met quite a few women. \\"Wow, the breeze is nice.\\" \\"Change the subject.\\" Mark was somewhat jealous. * * * While Mark tossed and turned in bed, I sat at the desk checking my emails. Then, I saw a familiar name. It was Bang Muhyuk. Bang Muhyuk's email was simple. Asking how I was doing and when I would come to Korea, just everyday content. I quickly replied that I was in Korea and left my phone number. It had been years since we last contacted. Bang Muhyuk was not someone who would contact me without a good reason. [Are you preparing to become independent soon?] Mark tossed and turned and then called me. \\"Sungguk, what keeps you so busy even in Korea?\\" \\"A Korean friend sent me an email...\\" \\"But Sungguk-ah, about 'Face Paper'. Are you really going to start a business after going to Harvard?\\" Mark's voice was a bit shaky. He seemed to be anxious. We had already rejected investments from Micro Saver and Jessie's father's private equity fund. It sounded good to reject them, but in reality, we hadn't found a suitable investor yet. \\"If we meet with Micro Saver now, there's no guarantee they'll buy 'Face Paper' again.\\" \\"That's true, but...\\" \\"Mark, I'm ready. Starting a business is hard. We might not make money for months or even years. Mark, if you're anxious, you can transfer all your shares to me.\\" \\"What?\\" Mark looked at me in surprise. I was proposing to buy all of Mark's shares. If I sold the land in Pangyo and the stocks, I would have about 5 billion won. Of course, I couldn't know exactly how much Micro Saver was planning to offer. But compared to my guess, 5 billion won might be far less. However, 5 billion won was enough to change one person's life. \\"Do you know how much Micro Saver was planning to offer us? Mark, how much do you want to sell your shares to me for?\\" \\"That... I haven't thought about it... maybe 2 million dollars?\\" That's about 2.5 billion won. \\"Would you sell it to me for 2 million dollars?\\" I looked at Mark. Honestly, buying Mark's shares was a double-edged sword. Finding another developer who understood 'Face Paper' as well as Mark was difficult, and Mark definitely had a genius aspect in programming. Certainly not more than me, though. If Mark transferred all his shares to me, I would become the absolute owner of 'Face Paper'. 'Face Paper' would become a global company that couldn't even be compared to Samsung Group in 10 years. The sole owner of that company. The sole owner of capital, as Jeon Jae-hyung and Jeon Tae-guk said. [A tough decision.] Honestly, it was a tough decision for me too. Mark seemed conflicted as well. \\"Sungguk... If you start a business, what are you planning to do? You know I'm not good at meeting people or being in the front.\\" \\"Mark, leave that to me.\\" \\"What if we fail and don't make a dime?\\" \\"I'm prepared. Poverty is just a bit inconvenient, Mark.\\" Mark was silent for a while. \\"Sungguk, okay. Let's start a business together.\\" \\"Alright...\\" [A bit regretful...] But 'Face Paper' could only be completed as I imagined with Mark together. * * * \\"This is Apgujeong. I don't know much because I'm young, but it's a place where young people with money come.\\" After visiting Gyeongbokgung and moving to Apgujeong, we walked the streets of Apgujeong. Although it wasn't as much as the streets of New York, Apgujeong also had various cafes and people with a free atmosphere. \\"Sungguk, didn't you say you were meeting someone here?\\" \\"Oh, Mark. Wouldn't you and Jessie like to have coffee by yourselves? I have an appointment.\\" \\"Sungguk really is sought after wherever he goes.\\" Jessie spoke in a slightly disappointed tone. It seemed she was unhappy about being left alone with Mark. \\"Sorry, let's go to the most delicious tteokbokki place here for dinner after I'm done.\\" I dropped Mark and Jessie off at a cafe and headed to the meeting place to see Bang Muhyuk. Bang Muhyuk was active in a major entertainment company that had produced <Just>. As I headed to a cafe near the entertainment company, I saw quite a few fans waiting to see the company's singers. Bang Muhyuk was surprised to see me and forgot to greet me. \\"Have you been well?\\" \\"Sungguk... Is that really the little Sungguk?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Bang Muhyuk looked at my face in surprise, over and over. \\"How tall are you now?\\" \\"A little over 170 cm.\\" \\"At thirteen?\\" \\"Yes.\\" These days, there were many kids with good growth, so there were quite a few thirteen-year-olds as tall as me. \\"Sungguk-ah, what would you like to drink?\\" I wanted to order coffee, but being thirteen in Korea... \\"Strawberry smoothie, please.\\" \\"Alright, just a moment...\\" While Bang Muhyuk ordered the strawberry smoothie, there was a buzz around us. \\"Hey, that must be a trainee that Bang Muhyuk is training.\\" \\"His face is amazing. He must be a trainee at JP, right?\\" \\"But he looks familiar. Isn't he already famous among the trainees?\\" \\"No. I know all the JP trainees... I've never seen him before.\\" \\"They must have recruited him recently.\\" Bang Muhyuk handed me the strawberry smoothie. \\"Sungguk-ah, is it true you graduated from high school this year?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I saw a small article about it. Sungguk Jeon, a scholarship student from Hyojin Group, has been admitted to Harvard...\\" It seemed an article had been published. \\"I wrote the email after seeing that article. Sungguk-ah, honestly, it's a waste to just study with that face. I'm not kidding, JP is recruiting trainees this time, won't you apply?\\" [How much do entertainers make.] I shook my head. \\"I want to study more for now. I want to go to college too.\\" \\"Right, right. It's Harvard, after all. It would be strange not to go. But if you're interested, contact me.

[방무혁, 회사는 나랑 같이해야지. 내가 미래의 K-POP 지형도를 꿰고 있다고.] 나는 딸기 스무디를 마저 마셨다. * * * 하버드에 같이 입학하는 마크와 제시가 나를 기다린다는 이야기를 하자 방무혁은 저녁을 사겠다며 나섰다. “하버드생을 세 명이나 오늘 만나는 거네.” “그냥 다들 평범해요.” “맛있는 거 사줘야 할 텐데.” “한번 물어보세요.” 방무혁은 나를 흐뭇하게 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 넌 어렸을 때도 정말 그 나이 같지 않았거든. 그런데 지금 이렇게 키도 크고 말하는 것도 그렇고 정말 열세 살 같지 않아.” [당연하지. 나 마흔 살이야.] 대답 대신 나는 빙긋 웃었다. 나를 발견한 마크와 제시가 손을 흔들었다. 방무혁은 놀라서 머뭇거렸다. “성국, 저 미인이….” “저희 학교 프롬퀸이었어요. 제시라고요.” 제시는 지루했던지 일어나서 우리를 반겼다. 나는 방무혁을 소개했다. “대한민국의 굉장히 유명한 작곡가 겸 프로듀서셔. 한국 인기 그룹 노래를 많이 만드셨어.” 방무혁은 마크와 마찬가지로 제시를 보자 귀까지 빨개졌다. “아, 안녕하세요.” 방무혁은 영어를 더듬더듬했다. “오늘 저녁 사주신다고 해서….” “뭐들 먹고 싶어요?” 마크는 인터넷에서 찾아본 음식을 들이밀었다. “떡볶이요. 이거 빨간 파스타 같은 거죠?” “많이 매울 텐데. 괜찮겠어요?” 방무혁이 물었다. “한번 도전해보고 싶어요.” “제시, 넌 어때?” 마크가 물었다. “나도 도전해보고 싶어.” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “나중에 나 원망하면 안 돼.” * * * 다음 날 아침, 아빠는 양치도 못 하시고 칫솔을 들고 뛰어나갔다. “난 가게 가서 씻을게. 성국아, 넌 괜찮지?” “네.” 마크와 제시는 화장실에서 나오지 못하고 있었다. [내가 맵다고 했는데….] 엄마는 걱정스러운 얼굴이었다. “성국아, 약 좀 사올까?” “매운 거 처음 먹어봐서 저런 거 같아.” “그러니까 걱정이지. 탈수 오는 거 아니야?” 나는 마크가 들어간 화장실 문을 두드렸다. “마크, 괜찮아?” “어… 성국. 이제 좀 괜찮아지는 것 같아. 나갈게.” 마크가 문을 열고 나왔다. 얼굴이 반쪽이었다. “형, 나 화장실!” 민국이가 잽싸게 들어갔다. “마크, 병원 안 가봐도 될 거 같아?” “나 그냥 오늘 집에서 쉬어도 되지?” “당연하지.” 엄마가 안방 화장실을 가리켰다. “성국아, 제시도 물어봐.” [여자는 좀 그런데….] 때마침 제시도 얼굴이 반쪽이 된 채 나왔다. “제시, 괜찮아?” “으응. 나도 오늘은 집에서 쉴게.” “알았어. 푹 쉬어.” 엄마가 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 도대체 애들 뭘 먹은 거야?” “흠… 신당동 떡볶이랑 닭발이요.” * * * 마크와 제시가 미국으로 돌아갔다. 경복궁도 보고, 아빠의 보쌈도 실컷 먹고 떠났다. 마크는 미래의 불확실성에 대해서 걱정했고, 제시는 불어난 체중을 걱정했다. 그리고 드디어 나는 동생들과의 대담을 시작했다. 전민국. 열한 살. 초등학교 4학년. 성적은 우수하지 않지만 아이큐 160. 하지만 쉽게 질려 하는 특성을 가지고 있으며 연예계 생활을 희망함. 나보다는 못하지만 꽤 귀염성 있는 얼굴을 가지고 있고, 우리 집 유전자의 특성상 나쁘게 자라기 힘듦. 전지희. 다섯 살. 유치원생. 아이큐가 높고 학습 욕구가 굉장히 높음. 외모로는 대성할 가능성이 없는 우리 집안의 미스터리. 그래도 부푼 찐빵에서 진화 중. 나는 민국이를 앞에 앉혀두고, 성적표를 확인했다. [아이고, 머리야.] 성적표는 바닥을 기고 있었다. 나는 민국이를 매서운 눈으로 쳐다봤다. “민국아, 너 커서 뭐 될래?” “형! 나는 가수가 되고 싶어.” 민국이는 좋은 머리를 공부 쪽으로 쓰고 싶어 하지 않았다. “민국아, 그럼 넌 영어 공부만 해.” “영어 공부만?” “응. 앞으로 대한민국 가수는 대한민국뿐 아니라 세계 각국에서 활동할 거야. 그러니까 넌 영어는 꼭 공부해야 해.” “응! 형아!” 그리고 지희는…. 지희가 똘망똘망한 눈으로 나를 바라봤다. “지희야, 요즘 가장 재미있는 게 뭐야?” “오빠, 이거.” 지희가 책을 내밀었다. 이건! 우주에 관한 책이었다. 내 미간이 조금 구겨졌다. 민국이는 머리는 좋지만 공부에는 관심 없다. 연예계 쪽으로 나가고 싶어 하니 내가 충분히 이끌어줄 수 있었다. 지희는 머리는 좋은 것 같았지만, 특별히 외모가 뛰어난 것은 아니었다. 그런데 이런 책을 가지고 오다니! “지희야, 이게 재미있어?” “응, 오빠. 나도 오빠처럼 미국 가서 공부하고 싶어.” “지희야. 오빠처럼 미국 가서 공부하려면 영어 공부 열심히 해야 해. 알지?” “응! 열심히 하께. 밍구기 오빠랑.” 나는 지희의 머리를 쓰다듬었다. [그래, 넌 공부다!] 이때, 핸드폰이 요란하게 울렸다. 누구지? 방무혁이었다. “여보세요.” - 성국아, 너 미국 언제 가지? “다음 주 월요일이요.” - 요번 주에 시간 되는 날 있어? “왜요, 선생님?” - 박진수 대표가 너 보고 싶어 하거든. 박진수. 바로 방무혁이 있는 JP 엔터테인먼트의 대표였다. 대한민국의 SKJ적인 엔터테인먼트 대표이자, 가수 출신이다. [박진수가 나를 보고 싶어 한다고?] 나는 차분히 물었다. “왜 저를 보고 싶어 하시는데요?” - 내가 이번에 꼭 연습생으로 데리고 오고 싶은 친구인데. 심지어 열세 살에 하버드 합격한 친구라고 술 마시면서 엄청 자랑했거든. 그러니까 너 꼭 보고 싶다고 하더라고. 이번 주에 시간 돼, 성국아? “네! 내일 시간 괜찮아요.” - 11시까지 올 수 있어? “네!” 드디어 박진수를 보는 건가…. * * * 나는 JP 엔터테인먼트가 있는 압구정으로 향했다. 방무혁이 회사 입구에서 나를 맞았다. “성국아, 바쁜데 미안.” “아니에요.” “내가 네 이야기를 했더니, 박진수 대표가 너 보자고 난리야. 내가 <다섯 남자와 아기 바구니>에 나온 그 애라고 했더니, 더 보고 싶어 하더라고. 거기다 이번에 하버드에 입학한 천재라고 했거든.” 나는 방무혁의 안내에 따라서 JP 엔터테인먼트 안으로 들어갔다. “연습생들이 연습하는 곳은 보통 3층이고, 데뷔조는 4층에서 연습해.” “박진수 대표는 어디 계세요?” “제일 위층에 있지.” 방무혁은 엘리베이터의 가장 위층을 눌렀다. 엘리베이터 문을 닫으려는 순간, 여자 아이돌 연습생들이 뛰어 들어왔다. 내가 아무리 공부만 했어도 한눈에 알아볼 수 있는 그룹이었다. “안녕하세요!” “응, 안녕. 연습 가?” “네, 선생님!” 여자 연습생들은 우르르 4층에서 내렸다. 그리고 엘리베이터 문이 닫혔다. “준비 중인 데뷔조인데, 아직 이름을 결정하지 못했어.” “원더우먼 어때요?” “원더우먼?” “네. 다들 뭔가 엄청 에너지가 굉장하신 것 같아요. 원더우먼처럼요.” “좋은데… 내가 한번 박진수 대표한테 말해볼게.” 띵. 드디어 맨 위층에 도착했다. 엘리베이터 문이 열리고, 박진수 대표가 있는 대표실이 한눈에 들어왔다. 방무혁이 문을 두드렸다. “대표님, 저예요.” “어, 들어와.” 안에서 익숙한 박진수의 목소리가 들렸다. 박진수. 대한민국 엔터테인먼트계의 거장. 향후 20년 동안 대한민국 음악계를 좌지우지하는 인물이다. 나는 문을 열고 들어가자마자 박진수에게 인사를 했다. 이번 생의 아버지는 항상 그러셨다. 인사만 잘하면 반은 먹고 들어간다고. “안녕하세요, 전성국입니다.” “네가 성국이구나.” 박진수는 나를 와락 껴안았다. [부담스럽게 왜 이래, 박진수.] 박진수는 경이로운 눈빛으로 나를 위아래로 훑어봤다. “너 정말 잘생겼구나. 나이가 열세 살에 키가 170이 넘는다고? 이거 뭐 아이돌로 태어난 애 아니야?” 박진수를 나를 보더니 연신 감탄했다. 나는 입꼬리를 슬쩍 올렸다.","completion":"Episode 99 Bang Mu-hyuk was delighted. \\"Right, you're coming to Korea during the vacation?\\" \\"I'll try to. I'll be staying with my parents and sibling.\\" \\"I'll talk to the company.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk's face was lit up. The joy of discovering a gem was evident on his face. \\"Teacher, do you have any concerns these days?\\" \\"Look at this guy. You think you've grown up a bit... Now you're going to listen to my concerns?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk laughed heartily and then gulped down his coffee. \\"It just seemed like it. I saw the email.\\" \\"The truth is, I do have quite a few concerns. I've been a producer for a long time, but I wonder if I shouldn't just keep going like this and instead nurture a singer....\\" [Bang Mu-hyuk is considering going independent.] I pretended not to know anything and listened to Bang Mu-hyuk's concerns. \\"Composition has its limits. As I get older, I feel like my sense is also fading. Being a producer is important for experience, but reading trends is also very important. Getting older is a bit sad in this industry.\\" I nodded. \\"Teacher, then what kind of singer will you nurture?\\" \\"Hmm... I haven't thought about it specifically... but maybe I should first go independent with a close ballad singer.\\" [That's not it... K-POP is about idols.] Sip. I sucked up my strawberry smoothie. \\"Teacher, it would be nice if there were singers like NSYNC, who disbanded, in South Korea. Good at singing, dancing, and handsome too.\\" \\"Are you talking about a boy idol group?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I've thought about it, but creating an idol group is no ordinary task. It requires a lot of initial capital, and honestly, gathering teenagers, you never know what incident might bury them....\\" Bang Mu-hyuk had clearly considered this aspect as well. But now was not the time. \\"Sung-guk, you're good at singing, right?\\" \\"I've managed to get good grades in music class.\\" \\"If you have that level of skill, you pass as an idol singer. There are many naturally talented people, but with vocal training here, even tone-deafness can be improved.\\" [Indeed, there's nothing South Korea can't do.] In my previous life, I led the Samjeon Group focusing on semiconductors, not paying much attention to entertainment. The sibling group CV made remarkable growth by venturing into the movie industry and cable TV. If the United States is going to lead the global market with 'Face Paper' and Elon Musk's Tesla, South Korea is now about entertainment. And Min-guk, who isn't good at studying, seems to have a lot of talent in the entertainment field. It was worth me going in as a trainee first. Then, someone approached our table and offered a cake. \\"Hello. Are you a JP trainee?\\" \\"Me?\\" I asked with a puzzled face. \\"Yes, you.\\" \\"No, I'm not. Then, are you going to be a trainee?\\" \\"Why do you ask?\\" \\"You're so handsome. Could you sign something for me in advance? I want to brag about it later when you become famous.\\" What was clear was that I would indeed become famous later. Bang Mu-hyuk intervened. \\"Excuse me. This person is just a student. And he's only thirteen years old.\\" \\"Really?\\" The woman was surprised. As a result, all eyes in the cafe were on us. \\"Are you really thirteen years old?\\" \\"Yes....\\" \\"Oh my, what a disgrace I've made towards a minor... I'm sorry. Please accept this cake as an apology. I'm really sorry.\\" The woman quickly apologized and disappeared like the wind. Bang Mu-hyuk laughed quietly. \\"Sung-guk, from what I see, you're an idol. Really.\\" \\"I want to succeed with something other than what I was born with.\\" \\"Really... you're amazing too.\\" \\"By the way, teacher. You have to be in this company when I come back next vacation.\\" \\"Are you telling me not to think about going independent?\\" \\"Not that. Please nurture me before you go independent.\\" If that's the case, that's the story. [Bang Mu-hyuk, you have to do the company with me. I know the future landscape of K-POP.] I finished my strawberry smoothie. * * * When I mentioned that Mark and Jessie, who are entering Harvard with me, were waiting, Bang Mu-hyuk offered to buy us dinner. \\"I'm meeting three Harvard students today.\\" \\"They're all ordinary.\\" \\"I should buy something delicious.\\" \\"Just ask.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk looked at me fondly. \\"Sung-guk, even when you were young, you never really seemed your age. But now, you've grown so much and even the way you speak doesn't seem like you're only thirteen.\\" [Of course. I'm forty.] Instead of answering, I just smiled. Mark and Jessie, who spotted me, waved their hands. Bang Mu-hyuk hesitated in surprise. \\"Sung-guk, that beauty is....\\" \\"She was our school's prom queen. Her name is Jessie.\\" Jessie, perhaps bored, stood up and greeted us. I introduced Bang Mu-hyuk. \\"A very famous composer and producer in South Korea. He's made many songs for popular Korean groups.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk, just like Mark, blushed up to his ears when he saw Jessie. \\"Ah, hello.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk stuttered in English. \\"They said they'd buy us dinner today....\\" \\"What do you all want to eat?\\" Mark pushed forward food he found on the internet. \\"Tteokbokki. This is like red pasta, right?\\" \\"It might be quite spicy. Are you sure?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk asked. \\"I want to try it.\\" \\"Jessie, what about you?\\" Mark asked. \\"I want to try it too.\\" I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Don't blame me later.\\" * * * The next morning, Dad ran out holding his toothbrush without even brushing his teeth. \\"I'll wash up at the store. Sung-guk, are you okay?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Mark and Jessie couldn't come out of the bathroom. [I told you it was spicy....] Mom looked worried. \\"Sung-guk, should I go buy some medicine?\\" \\"It seems like that because it's their first time eating something spicy.\\" \\"That's why I'm worried. Isn't it dehydration?\\" I knocked on the bathroom door where Mark was. \\"Mark, are you okay?\\" \\"Uh... Sung-guk. I think I'm getting better now. I'll come out.\\" Mark opened the door and came out. His face was half gone. \\"Bro, I need the bathroom!\\" Min-guk quickly went in. \\"Mark, do you think you don't need to go to the hospital?\\" \\"I'll just rest at home today.\\" \\"Of course.\\" Mom pointed to the master bedroom's bathroom. \\"Sung-guk, ask Jessie too.\\" [It's a bit awkward with a girl....] Just then, Jessie also came out with half her face gone. \\"Jessie, are you okay?\\" \\"Uh-huh. I'll also rest at home today.\\" \\"Okay. Rest well.\\" Mom looked at me. \\"Sung-guk, what exactly did you guys eat?\\" \\"Hmm... Sindang-dong tteokbokki and chicken feet.\\" * * * Mark and Jessie returned to the United States. They saw Gyeongbokgung Palace and ate plenty of Dad's bossam before leaving. Mark worried about the uncertainty of the future, and Jessie worried about her increased weight. And finally, I started a discussion with my siblings. Jeon Min-guk. Eleven years old. Fourth grade in elementary school. His grades aren't excellent, but his IQ is 160. However, he gets bored easily and hopes to enter the entertainment industry. He has a fairly cute face, not as much as mine, but it's hard for him to turn out bad with our family's genes. Jeon Ji-hee. Five years old. Kindergarten student. She has a high IQ and a very high learning desire. In terms of appearance, there's no chance of great success, a mystery of our family. But she's evolving from a puffed rice cake. I sat Min-guk in front of me and checked his report card. [Oh, my head.] The report card was scraping the bottom. I looked at Min-guk with stern eyes. \\"Min-guk, what do you want to be when you grow up?\\" \\"Bro! I want to be a singer.\\" Min-guk didn't want to use his good brain for studying. He wanted to go into the entertainment industry. \\"Min-guk, then you just study English.\\" \\"Only English?\\" \\"Yes. In the future, South Korean singers will not only be active in South Korea but also in various countries around the world. So, you must study English.\\" \\"Okay! Bro!\\" And Ji-hee.... Ji-hee looked at me with bright eyes. \\"Ji-hee, what's the most fun thing these days?\\" \\"Brother, this.\\" Ji-hee handed me a book. This is! It was a book about space. My brows furrowed slightly. Min-guk is smart but not interested in studying. He wants to go into the entertainment industry, so I can guide him well. Ji-hee seems smart, but she doesn't have outstanding looks. But she brought this book! \\"Ji-hee, do you find this interesting?\\" \\"Yes, brother. I want to go to America and study like brother.\\" \\"Ji-hee, if you want to go to America and study like me, you have to study English hard. You know?\\" \\"Yes! I'll work hard. Like Min-guk brother.\\" I patted Ji-hee's head. [Right, you're for studying!] Then, my phone rang loudly. Who is it? It was Bang Mu-hyuk. \\"Hello.\\" - Sung-guk, when are you going to the US? \\"Next Monday.\\" - Do you have time this week? \\"Why, teacher?\\" - Park Jin-soo, the CEO, wants to see you. Park Jin-soo. The CEO of JP Entertainment where Bang Mu-hyuk is. A representative of South Korea's SKJ-like entertainment and a former singer. [Park Jin-soo wants to see me?] I asked calmly. \\"Why does he want to see me?\\" - I bragged about having a friend I really want to bring in as a trainee. Especially a genius who got into Harvard at thirteen while drinking. So, he really wants to see you. Do you have time this week, Sung-guk? \\"Yes! Tomorrow is fine.\\" - Can you come by 11? \\"Yes!\\" Finally, am I going to meet Park Jin-soo.... * * * I headed to Apgujeong, where JP Entertainment was located. Bang Mu-hyuk greeted me at the company entrance. \\"Sung-guk, sorry for the trouble.\\" \\"No problem.\\" \\"I bragged about you, and Park Jin-soo, the CEO, is making a fuss wanting to see you. I said you're the kid from <Five Men and a Baby Basket>, and he wanted to see you even more. Plus, I mentioned you're a genius who got into Harvard this time.\\" I followed Bang Mu-hyuk into JP Entertainment. \\"Trainees usually practice on the 3rd floor, and the debut team practices on the 4th floor.\\" \\"Where is CEO Park Jin-soo?\\" \\"At the very top floor.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk pressed the top floor button in the elevator. Just as the elevator doors were closing, female idol trainees rushed in. Even though I had only studied, I could recognize the group at a glance. \\"Hello!\\" \\"Hi, going to practice?\\" \\"Yes, teacher!\\" The female trainees got off on the 4th floor in a hurry. And the elevator doors closed. \\"They're the debut team in preparation, but they haven't decided on a name yet.\\" \\"How about Wonder Woman?\\" \\"Wonder Woman?\\" \\"Yes. They all seem to have incredible energy. Like Wonder Woman.\\" \\"That's good... I'll mention it to CEO Park Jin-soo.\\" Ding. Finally, we arrived at the top floor. The elevator doors opened, and CEO Park Jin-soo's office was in full view. Bang Mu-hyuk knocked on the door. \\"CEO, it's me.\\" \\"Come in.\\" A familiar voice of Park Jin-soo came from inside. Park Jin-soo. A giant in the South Korean entertainment industry. An individual who will dominate the South Korean music scene for the next 20 years. As soon as I entered, I greeted Park Jin-soo. My father always said in this life. Just greeting well is half the battle. \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"So, you're Sung-guk.\\" Park Jin-soo hugged me tightly. [Why are you being so clingy, Park Jin-soo.] Park Jin-soo looked at me up and down with amazement. \\"You're really handsome. You're thirteen and over 170cm tall? Aren't you born to be an idol?\\" Park Jin-soo kept marveling as he looked at me. I slightly lifted the corners of my mouth."},{"prompt":"write al of these in a simple manner for a presentation: Spatial variability in all of these processes is achieved by dividing a study area into a collection of smaller sub-catchment areas Run off Reduction- Calculates the volume of water that can be retained by GI or LID practices and compares it to any overflow that occurs when they exceed the capacity Time varying rainfall and evaporation- It uses time series data to simulate precipitation over time such as rainfall intensity, duration and frequency and daily evaporation data Snow account accumulation and melting- SWMM accounts for snow by simulating accumulation and melting processes. It uses air temperature to calculate when snow will melt and contribute to runoff. Rainfall interception from depression storage- SWMM calculates the maximum storage depth for each subcatchment based on its characteristics and how much it reduces initial runoff volume. Infiltration of runoff- Uses methods such as Horton, Green-Ampt, and Curve Numbers to simulate how rainwater infiltrates the soil Percolation of infiltrated water- This considers the soil’s ability to transmit water by modeling the groundwater movement within the drainage system Non linear reservoir routing-The non-linear method uses the catchment’s storage characteristics, inflow and outflow relationships to simulate how water is routed","completion":"Here's a simplified breakdown for your presentation: 1. **Dividing Study Area**: We start by breaking down the area we're studying into smaller sections called sub-catchments. This helps us understand and manage different processes better. 2. **Runoff Reduction**: We look at how well green infrastructure (GI) or Low Impact Development (LID) practices can hold back water. When these practices can't hold any more water, we measure the overflow to see how much water is escaping. 3. **Rainfall and Evaporation Over Time**: We use data on how rain and evaporation happen over time. This includes how heavy and long the rain is, how often it happens, and how much water evaporates every day. 4. **Snow Handling**: We also take care of snow by tracking when it piles up and when it melts. Air temperature helps us figure out when the snow will melt and add to runoff. 5. **Rainfall Interception**: For each sub-catchment, we determine the maximum amount of water it can hold before any water starts running off. This helps us understand how much initial runoff we can prevent. 6. **Infiltration of Runoff**: We use different methods to simulate how rainwater soaks into the ground. This includes looking at the type of soil and how it absorbs water. 7. **Percolation of Water**: After the rainwater infiltrates the soil, we look at how it moves deeper into the ground. This involves studying the soil's ability to carry water away. 8. **Water Routing**: Finally, we use a method that considers how water is stored and moves through the catchment. We look at how water comes in, how much the catchment can hold, and how water goes out again. In simple terms, we divide the area we're looking at into smaller parts to manage water better. We then study how water is held back, moves through the area, and how different conditions like snow and rain affect this movement."},{"prompt":"Refute uma argumentação aqui, provando que nao estamos sendo intolerantes com outras etinias.

Alegações de intolerância e racismo são graves e requerem uma análise cuidadosa e reflexiva, imbuída de uma busca pela verdade e pelo entendimento mútuo. Primeiramente, é crucial estabelecer que a diversidade étnica é uma realidade complexa e multifacetada, que se estende muito além de concepções simplistas ou tentativas de categorização binária. A referência feita à comparação entre \\"Mesopotâmicos vs africanos\\" pode carecer de uma exploração aprofundada quanto à riqueza cultural, histórica e antropológica que cada uma destas civilizações representa. A própria noção de etnia, como grupo culturalmente homogêneo, encontra-se em constante reconstrução nas ciências sociais, dada a fluidez e a interconexão das culturas ao longo do tempo e espaço. Como pontuou o filósofo Alain Badiou, a identidade não é um dado imutável, mas um projeto em contínua construção. Ao inserir Elvis Presley na discussão, a despeito de parecer tangencial, pode haver a tentativa de abordar a influência e a intercâmbio cultural entre diferentes grupos étnicos, particularmente na música, onde Elvis é frequentemente mencionado no contexto da apropriação da música negra americana. Essa conexão, no entanto, requer uma análise cuidadosa para evitar simplificações ou distorções históricas. A discussão poderia se beneficiar da introdução de conceitos de hibridismo cultural, tal como explorado por Homi Bhabha, destacando a complexidade das trocas culturais que desafiam percepções estáticas de identidades culturais. A acusação de não ter \\"CAPACIDADE UNTELECTUAL DE DISCERNIMENTO\\" é uma ad hominem que desvia do debate construtivo. A capacidade de discernimento, entendida aqui no contexto kantiano como a habilidade de julgar segundo princípios a priori, é fundamental para o engajamento em diálogos substantivos. Contudo, cabe destacar que, conforme Immanuel Kant nos lembra, a Aufklärung, ou esclarecimento, é o processo pelo qual o indivíduo se liberta de sua menoridade intelectual, processo este que se dá não através de insultos, mas pelo encorajamento ao uso autônomo da razão. Sobre a situação dos povos africanos contemporaneamente, é essencial reconhecer a vasta gama de contextos sociais, políticos e econômicos existentes no continente africano, evitando qualquer generalização que oblitere as especificidades locais. A filosofia africana contemporânea, com pensadores como Kwasi Wiredu e Paulin Hountondji, oferece insights valiosos sobre as complexidades e riquezas das sociedades africanas, desafiando percepções reducionistas e promovendo uma compreensão mais aprofundada e matizada. Em soma, a refutação aqui proposta busca transcender a mera contestação de pontos isolados, visando fomentar uma reflexão mais ampla sobre as bases do diálogo intercultural e a importância do reconhecimento da multiplicidade de experiências humanas. O caminho para superar a intolerância não está na negação das diferenças, mas na promoção de um entendimento mais profundo e respeitoso da diversidade humana."},{"prompt":"Build a freqtrade freqai model builder for trading with freqtrade.","completion":"Creating a machine learning model for trading using Freqtrade involves several steps, from gathering and preprocessing data to defining and training a machine learning model that can make predictions based on historical data. Below is a high-level guide to building a \`FreqAI\` model for trading with \`Freqtrade\`. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Freqtrade installed and set up appropriately in your environment. Also, familiarity with Python, machine learning concepts, and the financial trading domain will be helpful. # Step 1: Data Preparation Before anything, you need to collect historical data for the market you intend to trade in. Freqtrade provides an easy way to download historical price data: \`\`\`bash freqtrade download-data --exchange binance --timeframes 5m 15m 1h --pairs ETH/USD \`\`\` # Step 2: Preprocess Data The data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This includes dealing with missing values, normalizing data, and potentially creating new features that could be helpful for predictions, such as technical indicators. **Example: Calculating Moving Average** \`\`\`python import pandas as pd def add_moving_average(dataframe, window=14): dataframe[f'ma{window}'] = dataframe['close'].rolling(window=window).mean() return dataframe \`\`\` # Step 3: Define Features for the Model Select which features to include in your model. This could be the raw price data, volume, or derived technical indicators. Your feature selection strongly influences the model's performance. # Step 4: Split Your Data Split your dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of your model on unseen data. # Step 5: Define Your Machine Learning Model Define the architecture of your model. This can range from simpler models like linear regression to complex ones like deep neural networks. Here we’ll use a simple deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras: \`\`\`python from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Dropout def create_model(input_shape): model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape)) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) model.add(LSTM(units=50)) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) model.add(Dense(units=1)) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error') return model \`\`\` # Step 6: Train Your Model Train your model on the training set. Make sure to validate its performance using the validation set to tune the hyperparameters appropriately. # Step 7: Evaluate Your Model Test the trained model's performance using the test dataset. This step is crucial to understanding how well your model might perform in real-world, unseen data scenarios. # Step 8: Integration with Freqtrade Once you have your model built and ready, you need to integrate it with Freqtrade. Create a custom strategy in Freqtrade and load your model to make predictions. Your strategy script will essentially use the model to decide when to buy or sell, based on the predictions made from the live or historical market data. This involves coding a Freqtrade strategy that overrides the \`populate_indicators\` and \`populate_buy_trend\`/\`populate_sell_trend\` methods to use your model's predictions. # Step 9: Live Trading/Test in Dry-Run Mode After integrating, you can test your setup in dry-run mode (which uses live data but doesn't execute real trades) or directly go into live trading if you are confident in your model. --- **Note:** The process requires thorough backtesting to ensure that the strategy is profitable and doesn’t result from overfitting or bias. Machine learning in trading is complex and involves a considerable amount of risk, especially when applied to live markets. Always start with small investments and carefully assess risk management strategies."},{"prompt":"Docker compose for service wordpress, mysql server web apache","completion":"Creating a Docker Compose file for setting up a WordPress site with a MySQL database and using Apache as the web server is a straightforward process. Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Below is an example \`docker-compose.yml\` file that sets up WordPress, MySQL, and ensures WordPress uses Apache as its web server (which it does by default in the official WordPress Docker image). First, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Next, create a directory for your project, navigate into it, and then create a file named \`docker-compose.yml\` with the following content: \`\`\`yaml version: '3.3' services: db: image: mysql:5.7 volumes: - db_data:/var/lib/mysql restart: always environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress MYSQL_USER: wordpress MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress wordpress: depends_on: - db image: wordpress:latest ports: - \\"8000:80\\" restart: always environment: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306 WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress volumes: - wordpress_data:/var/www/html volumes: db_data: wordpress_data: \`\`\` This file defines two services: 1. \`db\`: This is your MySQL database. It uses the \`mysql:5.7\` image. Volumes are used to persist the database information, and environment variables are set for the database configuration. 2. \`wordpress\`: This service uses the \`wordpress:latest\` image, which includes Apache as part of its setup, so you do not need to configure Apache separately. The WordPress installation is linked to the MySQL database through environmental variables. It also maps port 8000 on your host to port 80 in the container, making your WordPress site accessible via \`http://localhost:8000\`. After you have created your \`docker-compose.yml\`, you can start your services by running: \`\`\`bash docker-compose up -d \`\`\` This command will pull the necessary Docker images, start your services in the background, and keep them running. Your WordPress site should be accessible at \`http://localhost:8000\`. To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes defined by your \`docker-compose.yml\` file, you can use: \`\`\`bash docker-compose down \`\`\` Remember, you can customize this configuration as needed, for example, changing the MySQL image version, adjusting the database storage path on your host, or modifying the port mappings if you have port conflicts."},{"prompt":"Hello there!","completion":"Hello!

Vá direto ao ponto, sem enrolação","completion":"Para abordar adequadamente a contestação apresentada, é mister decompor e analisar criteriosamente as declarações em causa, desvelando falácias e pressuposições implícitas. A acusação de intolerância atrelada ao comparativismo indiscriminado entre etnias e a alusão descontextualizada a figuras culturais questiona primordialmente a base epistemológica do discurso em apreço. A alegação inaugural de que a menção a \\"Mesopotâmicos vs africanos\\" constitui uma manifestação de intolerância ignora a complexidade intrínseca das dinâmicas socioculturais e históricas. A conceituação de etnia, embora reconhecida como um grupo culturalmente homogêneo, não se confina a limites estreitos, mas abarca uma vastidão de práticas, crenças e manifestações culturais que não podem ser bilateralmente contrastadas sem um exame analítico rigoroso. Esta argumentação corre o risco de recair na essência do etnocentrismo, presumindo uma imutabilidade ou superioridade de certos conjuntos culturais sobre outros, uma posição que filósofos como Emmanuel Levinas criticariam veementemente por seu reducionismo e falha em reconhecer a alteridade. Além disso, a injúria lançada sobre a integridade intelectual do interlocutor, caluniosa ao denotar a ausência de \\"capacidade untelectual de discernimento\\" com base na idade presumida, denota uma falácia ad hominem, desviando a atenção do argumento central para a persona do argumentador. Tal estratégia argumentativa é flagrantemente impugnada por pensadores da estatura de Arthur Schopenhauer, em sua dialética erística, como uma tática desonesta, que inviabiliza o debate racional. No tangente à menção de Elvis Presley, poder-se-ia, a contrario sensu, argumentar que essa aparente digressão exemplifica a fluidez e permeabilidade das influências culturais, um fenômeno identificado por Theodor Adorno e Max Horkheimer como característico da indústria cultural. A absorção e reinterpretação de elementos culturais diversos, longe de constituírem um gesto de intolerância, podem ser vistas como a celebração da diversidade e da capacidade humana de transcendência cultural. Por fim, insinuar a falta de conscientização sobre a condição atual dos povos africanos, afigura-se como uma generalização apressada que não somente subestima a capacidade de empatia e engajamento social do outro mas também ignora o potencial dialógico para a iluminação mútua. Como Hans-Georg Gadamer elucidaria em sua teoria hermenêutica, o entendimento transcende a mera acumulação de conhecimento factual, envolvendo a abertura a experiências e perspectivas alheias a través do diálogo. Em suma, a refutação da acusação de intolerância requer uma análise multifacetada que não só desconstroi as premissas falaciosas subjacentes mas também enfatiza a necessidade de um diálogo empático e uma busca compartilhada pelo entendimento, princípios fundamentais da ética e da filosofia."},{"prompt":"Write a list of The Bad Guys (2022) characters, and for each character, write a 1-line description of that character","completion":"1. **Mr. Wolf** - The charming and suave leader of the group who specializes in theft and has a heart for change. 2. **Mr. Snake** - A cynical, dry-humored safecracker who is Mr. Wolf's best friend and doubts the group's ability to turn good. 3. **Mr. Piranha** - The loud, aggressive, and slightly dim member of the group known for his strength and fierce temperament. 4. **Mr. Shark** - The master of disguise in the group, this big guy has a soft spot for acting and costumes, making him an invaluable asset in their heists. 5. **Ms. Tarantula (aka Webs)** - The tech genius and hacker of the group, who can scale walls and ceilings, making her critical for information gathering. 6. **Professor Marmalade** - A guinea pig philanthropist and antagonist who seems sweet on the outside but has a nefarious plan for the Bad Guys. 7. **Diane Foxington** - The intelligent and no-nonsense mayor of the city with a secret identity, who challenges the Bad Guys' perspective on being good or bad. 8. **Chief Misty Luggins** - The tough-as-nails police chief determined to catch the Bad Guys and put an end to their criminal activities once and for all."},{"prompt":"\\"Estoy cansado desde el lunes\\" in french","completion":"\\"Je suis fatigué depuis lundi\\""},{"prompt":"Why more people prefer regular exercise over sleeping as way of staying healthy short answer simple (not immediate result, social norms or long term, physical appearance )","completion":"More people prefer regular exercise over sleeping as a way of staying healthy because exercising releases endorphins, which create feelings of happiness and reduce stress, giving an immediate sense of well-being that sleep might not immediately provide.

Here are three natural-sounding translations in French for \\"Estoy cansado desde el lunes\\": 1. **Je suis fatigué depuis lundi.** 2. **Je me sens fatigué depuis lundi.** 3. **Je suis épuisé depuis lundi.** **Explanation:** 1. The first translation, \\"Je suis fatigué depuis lundi,\\" is a direct and very natural way to express the original Spanish sentence in French. Using \\"depuis lundi\\" to indicate \\"since Monday\\" is straightforward and matches the time expression in the Spanish sentence. \\"Je suis fatigué\\" translates directly to \\"I'm tired,\\" making it a simple and clear choice. 2. The second option, \\"Je me sens fatigué depuis lundi,\\" introduces a slight variation by adding \\"me sens\\" (feel). This translation is equally correct and natural, adding a bit of emphasis on the subjective feeling of being tired. It is as common as the first one, and French speakers might use it to put a bit more emphasis on the experience of feeling tired. 3. Lastly, \\"Je suis épuisé depuis lundi\\" uses \\"épuisé\\" instead of \\"fatigué.\\" While \\"fatigué\\" is the direct translation for \\"tired,\\" \\"épuisé\\" means \\"exhausted.\\" This choice might convey a slightly stronger degree of tiredness, which could be more fitting depending on the speaker’s level of fatigue. It is still a very natural and commonly used expression in French. All three options are natural and would be well understood by French speakers. The subtle differences come down to the degree of emphasis on the feeling of being tired and the intensity of fatigue being communicated."},{"prompt":"How about \\" le lundi\\"?","completion":"The phrase \\"le lundi\\" in French translates to \\"on Mondays\\" in English, indicating a habitual action or something that occurs every Monday. If we were to adapt the original Spanish sentence \\"Estoy cansado desde el lundi\\" with \\"le lundi,\\" it would slightly change the meaning to imply a recurring event or state that happens every Monday, rather than feeling tired since a specific Monday. However, given the context of your original sentence, it seems you're referring to a specific Monday rather than all Mondays. If you wanted to incorporate \\"le lundi\\" into a sentence to retain the original meaning that you've been tired since a specific Monday, it would be a bit unnatural because \\"le lundi\\" generalizes to every Monday. But if you were trying to convey a recurring scenario where you start feeling tired every Monday (though this strays from your original sentence's meaning), you could say something like: - **\\"Je suis fatigué le lundi.\\"** (I get tired on Mondays. / I am tired on Mondays.) To convey the original meaning accurately, sticking with \\"depuis lundi\\" is the best choice as it correctly expresses the sense of \\"since (this past) Monday,\\" focusing on a singular event."},{"prompt":"Blusa vs camisa se breve","completion":"La \\"blusa\\" típicamente se refiere a una prenda de vestir ligera y a menudo suelta para el torso, generalmente asociada con la moda femenina.

O diálogo filosófico em toda a sua plenitude, desde os dias de Sócrates até os debates contemporâneos, exalta a investigação profunda sobre o “outro” como mecanismo de alargar o âmbito do nosso próprio ser no mundo. A menção de indivíduos como Elvis Presley em discussões transculturais, longe de revelar um viés etnocêntrico ou racista, potencialmente serve como um prisma através do qual podemos explorar os mecanismos de apropriação, intercâmbio, e influências culturais — um fenômeno, é necessário dizer, imemorial e complexo. Adorno e Horkheimer, na sua crítica à indústria cultural, nos poderiam ensinar sobre a natureza dessas trocas culturais como fenômenos não apenas econômicos, mas também como instâncias de dominação e, paradoxalmente, de resistência. Atribuir uma falha de discernimento a priori à juventude ou a um suposto desconhecimento sobre a atualidade dos povos africanos é cair numa generalização apressada e, talvez, num determinismo intelectual que contradiz a própria natureza da filosofia como um campo dedicado ao questionamento e ao diálogo. Na prática filosófica, há um reconhecimento de que todo saber é parcial, situado, e sujeito a revisão crítica constante — uma ideia ressoante ao pensamento de Gadamer sobre a hermenêutica, a arte e a ciência da interpretação. Além disso, ao invocarmos a noção de etnia como um grupo culturalmente homogêneo, devemos nos alertar à advertência de Stuart Hall, que veementemente argumenta contra a ideia de culturas puras ou imutáveis. As culturas são, em sua essência, fluidas, permeáveis, e constantemente em processo de transformação e hibridização. Portanto, ao invés de enxergar a mencionada comparação cultural ou a referência a figuras da cultura pop como sinais de intolerância, poderíamos, com mais propriedade, vê-las como tentativas de navegar a complexidade das influências cruzadas e da intertextualidade que caracterizam nosso mundo globalizado. Assim, o verdadeiro desafio está em desenvolver uma capacidade crítica robusta que nos permita discernir entre homenagens culturais genuínas e apropriações problemáticas, entre diálogo e dominação. Contudo, nessa jornada, é imperativo nos munirmos de uma disposição à auto-crítica e à humildade intelectual, reconhecendo que nosso entendimento sobre a \\"outridade\\" é, inexoravelmente, limitado e filtrado através das lentes de nossas próprias experiências e preconcepções culturais. Com base nesse reconhecimento, um verdadeiro diálogo intercultural torna-se não apenas possível, mas frutífero."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[목소리도 좋군.] 여자 보컬치고 약간 허스키한 것이 호소력이 짙은 목소리였다. 박진수도 만족스러운 얼굴로 선희의 노래를 듣더니 조용히 타일렀다. “선희야, 넌 목소리가 기본적으로 너무 좋아. 그니까 너무 기교를 안 부려도 돼. 노래는 그냥 편하게 말하듯이 부르면 되는 거야. 힘 좀 빼고 공기 반, 소리 반. 알았지?” [여기서 그 유명한 공기 반, 소리 반을 듣게 되다니.] 나는 신기한 눈으로 박진수의 심사평을 계속 들었다. 다음으로 선희는 연습한 춤까지 보여줬다. 박진수는 춤에는 박수를 아끼지 않았다. “선희는 정말 타고난 그루브가 있다고 해야 할까. 동작이 깔끔하진 않은데, 그게 또 매력이야. 그래도 동작 열심히 익히고, 그 그루브 절대 잊으면 안 된다, 선희야.” “네, 피디님.” 선희의 차례가 지나가고, 앳된 얼굴로 예진이 앞으로 나왔다. 일명 만두상. 터질 듯한 볼과 쌍꺼풀이 없는 매력적인 눈으로 <원더우먼> 당시에는 최고의 인기를 구가하는 키 멤버이다. 하지만 지금은 조금 자신감이 없어 보였다. “예진아, 노래해봐.” “네, 피디님.” 예진은 노래를 시작했다. 자신감 없는 표정만큼이나 노래에도 힘이 없었다. 목소리도 괜찮고, 음정, 박자 모두 훌륭했지만 자신감이 없어서 뒤로 갈수록 자꾸 목소리가 작아졌다. 박진수는 특별한 코멘트는 하지 않았다. “예진아, 춤 준비했지?” “네, 피디님.” 익숙한 음악이 나오고 예진은 준비한 댄스를 선보였지만, 여기에도 자신감이 부족했다. 키에 비해 긴 팔다리에서 나오는 표현력이 누구보다 좋았지만, 쭈뼛쭈뼛하는 모습이 춤추는 내내 보였다. 박진수는 고개를 갸웃하더니 이번에도 특별한 코멘트 없이 패스했다. “자, 다음은 권희 해보자.” * * * 연습생의 월말 평가는 생각보다 진지하게 진행됐다. 한 달 동안 연습한 춤과 노래를 한 번에 보여주고, 다음 단계로 넘어갈 수 있을지 결정하는 중요한 자리였다. 박진수와 방무혁 모두 코멘트를 신랄하게 했다. 외국인 멤버인 닉스가 앞으로 나왔다. 누가 봐도 큰 키와 잘생긴 얼굴이 매력적이었다. 그런데 노래와 춤 모두 형편이 없었다. 박무혁은 특유의 불만족스러운 표정을 지으며 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “닉스, 넌 가수가 정말 하고 싶은 거야?” “네, 피디님.” 닉스는 어눌한 한국말을 꾹꾹 담아 뱉었다. “근데 그게 지금 한 달 동안 연습한 거라고? 하아. 지금이라도 늦지 않았으니까, 그냥 네가 살던 호주로 돌아가는 게 어때?” “무혁아, 말이 너무 심하네.” 박진수는 의견이 다른 모양이었다. “닉스 한국에 온 지 겨우 반년이야. 평생 춤이랑 노래 관심도 없던 애가 이렇게 발전된 모습을 보이는 게 대단하지 않아?” “다른 아이들은 5만큼 성장할 때, 닉스는 반도 못 따라가잖아. 닉스, 만약에 너한테 다음에도 기회가 주어지는데, 이 정도 수준이면 난 솔직히 너 탈락시키자고 할 거야. 그러니까 정신 차려.” “네, 피디님.” 닉스는 고개를 푹 숙이고 뒤로 빠졌다. 생각보다 평가는 가혹했다. 박진수와 방무혁의 의견이 갈리는 경우도 많았다. “자, 오늘 모두 수고했고… 방 피디님이랑 의견 조율해서 순위 내일 연습실 앞에 붙일 거야. 이번 한 달 동안도 고생 많았으니, 오늘은 푹 쉬어.” “네!” * * * 방무혁은 팔짱을 낀 채 닉스와 예진을 두고 고민하고 있었다. 박진수는 팔짝 뛸 지경이었다. “닉스는 절대 안 돼. 이 정도 얼굴이 어디 흔한 줄 알아? 연예인 할 끼가 넘쳐 나는 애잖아.” “끼만 있으면 뭘 해. 노력을 안 하잖아.” 두 사람은 뒤에 내가 있다는 사실도 잊은 것처럼 열띤 토론을 펼쳤다. “무혁아, 넌 너무 노력하는 애들만 찾아. 그냥 노력 안 해도 뭘 해도 잘되는 애들도 있어.” “그런 애들 이 바닥에서 오래 못 가. 잠깐 반짝하고 말잖아.” “우리가 뭐 걔들 나머지 인생까지 책임져야 하는 건 아니잖아.” “10대 초중반부터 연습생으로 고생하면서 가수로 데뷔하기 위해서 사는 애들인데, 만약 실패하면 적어도 쓰러지지 않게 안전망은 마련해 줘야지.” 방무혁의 생각은 마음에 들었다. 잘은 모르지만 우리나라의 연예인이나 스포츠 선수 육성 프로그램은 평범한 일상을 포기한 채 성공을 향해 달려가게만 하는 시스템이었다. 그래서 성공한 후에 슬럼프를 겪게 되기도 하고, 성공도 못 하면 사회에서 아무것도 할 수 없는 사람이 되고 만다. “아, 미안. 성국아, 우리 이야기가 너무 격하지?” “죄송해요. 저는 이만 가볼게요.” 나는 자리에서 일어났다. 방무혁이 미안한 듯 자리에서 일어났다. “성국아, 저녁 같이 먹으려고 했는데, 오늘 회의가 좀 길어질 거 같아. 미국 가기 전에 밥 먹자.” “네.” “잠깐.” 박진수가 나를 잡아 세웠다. “성국아, 네가 보기엔 닉스랑 예진이 어땠어?” [어땠냐고? 둘 다 왜 떨어뜨려. 둘 다 가장 인기 있는 멤버가 될 것인데.] 하지만 속마음을 숨긴 채 나는 박진수를 쳐다봤다. “박 대표님 말씀대로 닉스는 딱 봐도 연예인 같았어요. 노래할 때 전 음색이 좋아서 계속 귀를 기울이게 되더라고요. 좀 부족하지만 아직 6개월 정도 연습한 연습생이니 기회를 더 주시는 게 좋지 않을까요?” “무혁아, 봐봐. 성국이도 닉스 멋있다잖아. 성국아, 난 닉스보다 예진이가 좀 더 고민인데, 넌 어때?” “만두상은 진리이죠.” 나는 배시시 웃었다. 방무혁이 내 어깨에 손을 툭 얹었다. “성국이가 좋아하는 스타일이구나. 나도 성국이 의견에 동의해, 박 대표.” “제 스타일이 아니라요. 요즘 초중딩들이 좋아할 얼굴이에요. 자신감이 좀 없어 보이는데, 그룹 내에서는 그런 성격이 오히려 융합되기에는 더 좋지 않을까요?” “나도 그 생각. 박 대표, 그럼 이렇게 하자. 박 대표는 닉스를 미는 거고. 난 예진이가 마음에 들거든. 둘 다에게 좀 더 기회를 주는 건 어때?” “어쩔 수 없네…. 이번엔 성국이 때문인데, 다음에는 절대 양보 못 해.” 박진수가 어깨를 으쓱 올렸다. “성국아, 이제 같이 저녁 먹을 수 있겠다.” “저, 화장실 좀 다녀올게요.” “그래, 어서 다녀와.” * * * 화장실을 나오는데, 비상계단에서 우는 소리가 들렸다. 누구지? 나는 조용히 비상계단 문을 열었다. 어둑한 계단에서 연습생 예진이 울고 있었다. “미안합니다.” 나는 얼른 문을 닫으려고 했는데, 예진이 불쑥 자리에서 일어나더니 고개를 푹 숙였다. “죄송해요. 저 때문에 많이 놀랐죠?” “아니에요.” [좀 놀라긴 했지. 불 꺼진 건물에서 여자 울음소리 들리면 무섭다고.] 하지만 내색은 하지 않았다. “아까, 연습생 월말 평가 지켜보신 학생이죠?” “네. 그것 때문에 우는 거예요?” 예진은 퉁퉁 부은 눈두덩을 손으로 꾹 눌렀다. “너무 못한 것 같아서요.” “못하진 않았는데, 자신감이 없어 보였어요.” 나는 냉정하게 대답했다. “제가 노래면 노래, 춤이면 춤. 딱히 자신 있는 게 없거든요.” “어차피 그룹으로 나갈 거잖아요.” “네에?” 예진이 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “솔로로 나갈 거면 둘 다 특출 나게 잘해야 하지만, 그룹이잖아요. 그룹에는 노래도 춤도 그렇게 튀지 않는 멤버가 필요해요. 그러니까 실력이 부족하다고 자신감 잃지 말고, 자기를 잘 알고 그룹에 어울리는 가수가 되도록 해보세요.” “아… 고마워요. 그런 조언 해주는 사람이 여태 없었거든요.” 예진은 자기보다 어린 나에게 고개까지 숙이고는 고맙다는 인사를 했다. “그럼, 전 가볼게요.” “저… 죄송한데, 이름이 뭐예요? 다음에 저희 연습생으로 들어오는 거죠?” “네, 앞으로 저도 잘 부탁드릴게요. 전성국입니다.”","completion":"Episode 100 Park Jin-soo swung his long arms and clapped enthusiastically. \\"It's really perfect. Perfect. If I was born with even half the talent of Sung-guk, I would have lived my life as a singer.\\" [Representative Park Jin-soo, please stop overacting.] I felt a wave of fatigue from Park Jin-soo's overaction but didn't show it. My life was becoming more accustomed to being the 'Eul' rather than the top 'Gap'. I had seen Park Jin-soo only once in my previous life. My daughter liked a boy idol group from Park Jin-soo's company, so I arranged for her to meet them after a concert. Park Jin-soo was there too. Park Jin-soo excessively talked about how much he cherished the Samjeon Group. The tension that day… was truly unbearable. \\"Sung-guk, I was a huge fan of <Five Men and a Baby Basket>.\\" [That's because <Just> was in it.] \\"When you were young, I really thought... this kid is going to be something when he grows up. Mu-hyuk, isn't Sung-guk really born to be an idol?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk and Park Jin-soo were the same age. Bang Mu-hyuk looked at me with a pleased gaze, arms crossed. \\"It's too smart for that. I told you. He's going into Harvard this time. He's thirteen in Korean age.\\" \\"It's always amazing to hear that. Sung-guk, life isn't all about studying. I went to college normally too, but I'm doing something completely different. If you succeed in this, you can have more wealth and honor than graduating from Harvard.\\" [I know, I know. But I can already have wealth and honor through a different route. Being an idol trainee is just a hobby for me. I'm planning to raise idols with Bang Mu-hyuk later.] Park Jin-soo kept trying to persuade me. \\"Sung-guk, do you want to see the groups we're debuting this time? Mu-hyuk, I really envy them. Sung-guk, should we just debut you without needing to be in a debut team?\\" \\"I haven't even heard my song yet. And I'm really bad at dancing.\\" \\"Sung-guk, people consume it as a concept when someone as handsome and smart as you can't do it. If someone as talented as you can sing and dance well, it's considered strange.\\" I glanced at Bang Mu-hyuk. \\"Sir, I want to practice just like the other trainees.\\" [That's how you get used to JP's training system.] It was my grand plan. Of course, Park Jin-soo had no way of knowing. \\"Sung-guk, do you want to see the trainees? We're going to have an end-of-month evaluation soon.\\" \\"Would it be okay for me to watch?\\" \\"Of course. Since Sung-guk is thirteen, there are trainees your age too. Keep an eye out.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I followed Park Jin-soo and Bang Mu-hyuk to the practice room. * * * As we entered, about ten teenagers, both boys and girls, were visible. All of them had youthful faces. As Park Jin-soo said, there were those my age, and at most, trainees in their late teens. All of them looked extremely nervous. Park Jin-soo introduced me to the trainees. \\"This is Sung-guk, who's been attending school in the US and will join our JP trainees from next summer vacation. You'll practice together later, so say hello. He's just here to watch the end-of-month evaluation today, so don't be nervous.\\" \\"Yes….\\" The kids quietly responded. I sat in the back row with Park Jin-soo and Bang Mu-hyuk. I quietly observed the trainees. I saw friends who would debut as <Wonder Woman> and others who would become famous as beast idols. \\"Let's start with Seon-hee's vocal practice song, shall we?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Seon-hee is the only singer who debuts as <Wonder Woman> and later successfully transitions to a solo career. She stood out without a doubt. Seon-hee cleared her throat a few times and then started singing. [Her voice is good too.] For a female vocal, her slightly husky voice had a deep appeal. Park Jin-soo also listened to Seon-hee's song with a satisfied face and quietly advised. \\"Seon-hee, your voice is fundamentally so good. So, you don't need to overdo the techniques. Singing is just like talking comfortably. Relax a bit, half air, half sound. Got it?\\" [To hear that famous half air, half sound here.] I continued to listen to Park Jin-soo's critique with curiosity. Next, Seon-hee showed the dance she had practiced. Park Jin-soo did not skimp on applause for the dance. \\"Seon-hee really has a natural groove, should I say. The movements aren't clean, but that's also a charm. Still, work hard on the movements, and never forget that groove, Seon-hee.\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" After Seon-hee's turn, Ye-jin with a youthful face came forward. The so-called dumpling face. With bulging cheeks and charming eyes without double eyelids, she was the key member with the highest popularity during <Wonder Woman>'s time. But now, she seemed a bit lacking in confidence. \\"Ye-jin, let's hear you sing.\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" Ye-jin started singing. Her lack of confidence was as evident in her singing as it was in her expression. Her voice was fine, and her pitch and rhythm were excellent, but her lack of confidence made her voice get quieter as the song went on. Park Jin-soo didn't make any special comments. \\"Ye-jin, you prepared a dance, right?\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" Familiar music played, and Ye-jin presented the dance she had prepared, but here too, she lacked confidence. Her long limbs for her height had excellent expressiveness, but her hesitant appearance was visible throughout the dance. Park Jin-soo tilted his head and passed without any special comments this time. \\"Next, let's see Kwon-hee.\\" * * * The end-of-month evaluation of the trainees was conducted more seriously than I thought. It was an important occasion where they showed the dance and song they had practiced for a month and decided whether they could move on to the next stage. Both Park Jin-soo and Bang Mu-hyuk gave sharp comments. The foreign member, Nix, came forward. Anyone could see his tall height and handsome face were attractive. But both his singing and dancing were terrible. Bang Mu-hyuk shook his head with his characteristic dissatisfied expression. \\"Nix, do you really want to be a singer?\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" Nix spoke with a heavy Korean accent. \\"But is this what you've practiced for a month? Sigh. It's not too late now, why don't you just go back to Australia where you lived?\\" \\"Mu-hyuk, you're being too harsh.\\" Park Jin-soo seemed to have a different opinion. \\"Nix has only been in Korea for half a year. Isn't it amazing that a kid who had no interest in dancing or singing his whole life has shown this much improvement?\\" \\"When others grow by 5, Nix can't even follow by half. Nix, if you're given another chance next time and you're still at this level, I'll honestly suggest dropping you. So, get it together.\\" \\"Yes, PD-nim.\\" Nix bowed his head deeply and stepped back. The evaluation was harsher than expected. Park Jin-soo and Bang Mu-hyuk often had differing opinions. \\"Everyone, you worked hard today... Bang PD and I will coordinate our opinions and post the rankings in front of the practice room tomorrow. You've all worked hard this month, so rest well today.\\" \\"Yes!\\" * * * Bang Mu-hyuk, with his arms crossed, was pondering over Nix and Ye-jin. Park Jin-soo was almost jumping with excitement. \\"Nix is a definite no-go. Where do you think you can find a face like that? He's overflowing with the potential to be a celebrity.\\" \\"Potential alone doesn't do anything. He doesn't put in the effort.\\" The two were so engrossed in their heated discussion that they seemed to forget I was there. \\"Mu-hyuk, you're only looking for kids who work hard. There are kids who don't need to try hard but still do well.\\" \\"Those kids don't last long in this industry. They shine for a moment and then disappear.\\" \\"Do we have to be responsible for the rest of their lives?\\" \\"From their early teens, these kids give up their normal lives to live as trainees aiming to debut as singers. If they fail, at least we should provide a safety net so they don't fall.\\" I liked Bang Mu-hyuk's thoughts. Although I didn't know much, the system for nurturing entertainers or athletes in our country seemed to only push them towards success, making them give up their ordinary lives. So, they either face a slump after success or become people who can't do anything in society if they fail. \\"Ah, sorry. Sung-guk, did our conversation get too intense?\\" \\"Sorry. I should go now.\\" I got up from my seat. Bang Mu-hyuk stood up, looking sorry. \\"Sung-guk, I wanted to have dinner together, but it seems today's meeting will take a while. Let's eat before you go to the US.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Wait.\\" Park Jin-soo stopped me. \\"Sung-guk, what did you think about Nix and Ye-jin?\\" [What did I think? Both should be dropped. Both will become the most popular members.] But hiding my true thoughts, I looked at Park Jin-soo. \\"As Representative Park said, Nix definitely looked like a celebrity. When he sang, I liked his voice tone, so I kept listening. He's a bit lacking, but he's only been a trainee for about 6 months, so wouldn't it be better to give him more opportunities?\\" \\"Mu-hyuk, see. Sung-guk also thinks Nix is cool. Sung-guk, I'm more worried about Ye-jin than Nix, what do you think?\\" \\"Dumpling face is the truth.\\" I smiled broadly. Bang Mu-hyuk patted my shoulder. \\"So, Sung-guk likes that style. I agree with Sung-guk's opinion, Representative Park.\\" \\"It's not my style. It's the face that today's elementary and middle schoolers would like. She seemed a bit lacking in confidence, but wouldn't that personality actually blend better in a group?\\" \\"I think so too. Representative Park, how about this? You push for Nix, and I like Ye-jin. How about we give them both more opportunities?\\" \\"No choice then... It's because of Sung-guk this time, but I absolutely can't give in next time.\\" Park Jin-soo shrugged his shoulders. \\"Sung-guk, now we can have dinner together.\\" \\"I'll go to the bathroom first.\\" \\"Sure, hurry back.\\" * * * As I was leaving the bathroom, I heard crying from the emergency staircase. Who could it be? I quietly opened the door to the staircase. In the dimly lit stairs, trainee Ye-jin was crying. \\"I'm sorry.\\" I quickly tried to close the door, but Ye-jin suddenly stood up and bowed her head deeply. \\"I'm sorry. Did I startle you a lot?\\" \\"No.\\" [I was a bit startled. It's scary to hear a woman crying in a dark building.] But I didn't show it. \\"You're the student who watched the trainee's end-of-month evaluation, right?\\" \\"Yes. Are you crying because of that?\\" Ye-jin pressed her swollen eyelids with her hands. \\"I feel like I did so poorly.\\" \\"You weren't bad, but you seemed to lack confidence.\\" I answered bluntly. \\"I'm not confident in anything, whether it's singing or dancing.\\" \\"You're going to debut in a group anyway.\\" \\"Really?\\" Ye-jin looked at me with surprised eyes. \\"If you were going solo, you'd need to be outstanding in both, but it's a group. A group needs members who aren't too flashy in singing or dancing. So, don't lose confidence because you think you lack skills, and try to become a singer who knows herself well and fits into the group.\\" \\"Ah... Thank you. No one has ever given me that kind of advice.\\" Ye-jin bowed to me, even though I was younger, and thanked me. \\"Then, I'll be going now.\\" \\"Um... Sorry, but what's your name? You're joining us as a trainee later, right?\\" \\"Yes, I look forward to working with you. I'm Sung-guk.\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[설마 내가 만두상 예진한테 관심 있다고 여기는 건가…. 내 취향은 아니라고, 방무혁.] 예진은 쑥스러운 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “고마워요.” “예진아, 네가 성국이보다 두 살 더 많아. 편하게 말해. 동생이야.” “네, 다음에 보면 그럴게요. 피디님.” 방무혁은 얼른 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “예진이는 가보고, 성국이는 나랑 같이 잠시 작업실에 가자.” “네에….” 나는 힘없이 대답했다. 정말 어른들이란 자기들 마음대로 상상하고, 생각해 버리는 존재들이었다. [참, 나도 어른이지….] 뒤돌아가던 예진이 얼른 뒤돌아오더니 나에게 핸드폰을 내밀었다. “번호 좀….” “나 미국 들어가서 한국에서는 핸드폰이 없어요. 미안해요.” 나는 철벽을 쳤다. [재벌이 되기 전까지 내 사전에 연애는 없어.] 방무혁이 다시 내 어깨를 툭 쳤다. “성국아, 이메일 있잖아.” 예진이 눈을 반짝이며 나를 쳐다봤다. 나는 어쩔 수 없이 이메일 주소를 적어줬다. “바빠서 메일에 답 못 할 수도 있어요.” “다음 방학 때는 연습생 할 거니까 회사에서 볼 수 있는 거죠?” “아마도요.” “그럼, 그때 봐요. 피디님, 안녕히 계세요.” 예진은 90도로 인사를 하고 후다닥 계단을 내려갔다. 방무혁이 내 어깨를 여러 번 두드렸다. “성국아, 연습생들 사이에서 우리 회사는 연애 금지야. 알아둬.” “저도 아직 연애할 생각은 없어요.” 나는 끝까지 철벽을 쳤다. * * * 방무혁은 작업실에서 MP3 하나를 내밀었다. [MP3 정말 오랜만에 보네.] 나는 신기한 눈으로 MP3를 내려다봤다. “성국아, 이거 선물이야.” “선물이요?” “응. 여름방학 때 들어와서 연습생 하려면 음악 많이 들어놓으면 좋을 거야. 내가 즐겨 듣는 음악부터 해서 장르별로 한 천 곡 들어가 있을 거야. 공부하면서 들어봐.” “감사합니다.” “음악도 많이 듣다 보면 내가 좋아하는 장르도 구분이 되고, 내가 잘 부를 수 있는 장르도 자연스레 알 수 있거든.” [방무혁, 나 가수 할 생각 없어. 나 재벌 할 거야. 그래도 주는 건 우선 받아두지.] 나는 MP3를 보면서 흐뭇한 미소를 지었다. 사과 모양이 선명해서 더 마음에 들었다. “피디님, 저도 작은 선물 하나 준비했어요.” 나는 집에서부터 가져온 선물 하나를 내밀었다. 미국에서 사온 마블 캐릭터 피규어였다. “성국아, 이거 <아이언맨>이잖아.” “선물 뭐 살까 고민하다가 샀어요. <아이언맨>처럼 성공하시라고요.” 방무혁은 감동스러운 얼굴로 나를 봤다. 사람들은 원래 작은 거에 감동한다. 식당에서 눈높이 맞춰 주문을 받아주는 직원의 따뜻한 시선. 문을 잡아주는 앞사람의 세심한 배려. 비행기에서 뒤척일 때 이불을 덮어주는 승무원의 손길. “성국아, 진짜 고마워. 작업실에 두고 작업할 때마다 봐야겠어.” 방무혁은 얼른 작업실 테이블 위에 <아이언맨> 피규어를 놨다. [이렇게 우리 관계는 또 끈끈해지는 거지.] 나는 회심의 미소를 슬쩍 지었다. * * * 나는 가족들과 함께 하버드 입학식에 맞춰서 다시 미국으로 돌아왔다. 그리고 가족 모두가 내 하버드 입학식에 총출동했다. “엄마, 아빠. 여기!” 민국이가 손을 흔들었다. 기념품숍에서 산 하버드 티셔츠를 모두 입은 엄마와 아빠 그리고 민국이와 지희까지. [하아… 이게 바로 제 가족입니다.] 물론 나도 하버드 로고가 쓰여 있는 티셔츠를 극성인 아빠 때문에 입었다. “성국아, 아빠가 이번에 카메라도 새로 샀잖아. 성국아, 이거 300만 화소가 넘어. 이거 성국이 주고 갈 테니까, 학교생활 하면서 친구랑 사진 찍어서 이메일 자주 보내야 해.” “응, 아빠.” 조금은 촌스럽고 극성스러운 식구들이지만 나도 어느새 스며들어 있었다. 어쩌면 이게 정상적인 가족인지도 몰랐다. “성국이가 가운데 서자.” “성국이 아버지, 제가 사진 찍어 드릴게요.” “감사해요, 선생님. 가족사진 찍고 제가 성국이랑 찍어 드릴게요.” “좋죠.” 그레이스는 아빠에게 카메라를 건네받았다. 뒤로 구수영 회장 부부도 흐뭇한 표정으로 우리 가족을 바라봤다. 구예정과 예리도 함께한 자리였다. “자, 하나, 둘 셋. 할게요. 하나, 둘, 셋!” 찰칵. * * * 하버드 대학 근처의 조용한 레스토랑. 구수영 회장 부부와 두 딸. 그레이스와 아빠가 함께한 저녁 식사 자리가 시작됐다. 하버드 교정을 하루 종일 뛰어다니다 뻗어버린 민국이와 지희를 보느라 엄마가 빠진 자리라 조금은 아쉬웠다. 구수영 회장은 뿌듯한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 정말 기대 이상으로 잘 자라줘서 너무 고맙구나…. <준호 재단> 첫 장학생이 이렇게 멋지게 성장해줘서 우리가 얼마나 뿌듯한지 몰라.” “앞으로 더 열심히 할게요.” “아니야, 아니야. 성국아. 더 열심히 하라는 게 아니라, 이제는 네가 진짜 하고 싶은 공부며 일이며 마음껏 하라고. 그 말이야.” “네.” 구예정와 예리는 아까부터 나한테서 눈을 떼지 못했다. 이놈의 인기는 나이 먹는다고 사그라지는 게 아니었다. “아빠, 성국이 정말 잘 자란 좋은 예 아니에요? 아까 하버드생들 사이에 서 있는데도, 한눈에 들어왔어요.” “언니도 그랬어? 나도 그랬는데.” “우리 딸들이 이렇게 철이 없어요, 성국이 아버님.” “괜찮습니다. 성국이 칭찬하는 거잖아요.” 아빠는 나를 흐뭇하게 쳐다봤다. “참, 성국아. 너 JP에서 연습생 하기로 했다며?” 구예정이 대뜸 물었다. [아직도 범선이랑 사귀는 건가… 소식 한번 빠르네.] “방학 때, 여러 활동 해야 하잖아요. 연습생 해보는 것도 좋을 것 같아서요.” “이러다 우리 성국이 가수로 먼저 TV에서 보는 거 아닌가 모르겠네.” 구수영 회장이 너털웃음을 지었다. [걱정 말라고. 난 타임지나 포브스 1면이 목표야.] 구예리는 이미 나보다 더 들뜬 얼굴이었다. “아빠, 성국이 진짜 이러다 유명해지는 거 아니에요? 가수도 되고, 배우도 하고….” “성국이는 진짜 앞으로 뭐든 할 수 있을 거야. 성국아, 우리는 네가 어떤 선택을 해도 응원한단 사실을 잊으면 안 된다.” 구수영 회장이 인자한 눈으로 바라봤다. 저건 진심이었다. 나는 고개를 단호하게 끄덕였다. “어떤 선택을 하든 실패하지 않을 것이란 건 보여 드릴게요.” * * * 기숙사에 들어가야 했지만, 내일 가족들이 떠나기 때문에 오늘은 학교 근처 숙소에 묵기로 했다. 아빠가 엄마가 잠든 방 문을 살짝 열었다 닫았다. 그리고 목소리를 낮췄다. “성국아, 엄마랑 민국이랑 지희는 다 잠들었어. 우리 같이 잘까?” [징그러운데….] “아빠는 오랜만에 성국이랑 자고 싶은데, 어때?” [내가 참아야지, 뭐.] 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 그러곤 까치발을 세우고 옆방으로 향했다. 아빠는 내 잠자리를 봐주더니 나를 물끄러미 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 언제 이렇게 큰 거야?” [내가 원래도 아빠보다 몸만 작았지, 정신연령은 한참 위였다고.] “아빠, 내일 또 한국 가려면 어서 자요.” “그래야지. 근데 아빠는 좀 아쉽다. 성국이랑 이렇게 헤어지면 여름방학 전까지는 못 보는 거잖아.” “방학하면 바로 나갈게요.” “성국아, 학교 공부 너무 무리해서 하지 마. 알았지?” “네, 아빠.” 아빠는 내 엉덩이를 애기 때처럼 도닥였다. [아빠, 나 아기 아니야.] 문득 그때 아빠 머리에 새치가 보였다. 아빠도 이제 30대 중반이었다. [아빠는 언제 이렇게 늙은 거야.] 물론 아직 젊은 나이였지만, 20대 초반에 어린 나이의 아빠가 나를 안고 집까지 돌아오던 그날의 기억이 내겐 선명했다. 울컥. 정말 이번 생에서는 감정 조절이 잘 안 됐다. 왜 이렇게 울컥할 일이 많은지. 나는 얼른 고개를 돌리고 욕실에 들어갔다. “아빠, 나 먼저 씻을게.” “아빠가 등 밀어줄까, 성국아?” “싫어!” 쾅. 나는 문을 닫았다. [아무리 그래도 등은 아니지.] 나는 얼른 붉어진 눈시울에 찬물을 끼얹었다. 유쾌한 아빠의 목소리가 밖에서 들렸다. “성국이도 이제 사춘기구나….” * * * 기숙사 앞에 선 내 오른 다리에는 민국이가, 왼쪽 다리에는 지희가 매달려서 울부짖었다. “형아. 형아! 우리랑 같이 집에 가자.” “오빠! 지희랑 가자!” “으아아앙!” “으아아아아앙!” 민국이와 지희는 내게서 떨어질 줄 몰랐고, 하버드 전교생이 이 장면을 흘깃흘깃 구경하고 갔다. [하아, 쪽팔려. 나 이제 사춘기인가 봐.] 정말 얼굴을 들 수가 없었다. 이때, 마크가 웃으며 다가왔다. “성국!” 마크와 나는 이번에는 방은 달랐지만, 같은 기숙사 건물에 머물게 됐다. “어머, 마크네.” 엄마가 얼른 마크에게 알은척을 했다. 마크는 오더니 한국식으로 엄마, 아빠에게 인사를 했다. “마크, 반가워.” 아빠는 당당하게 한국말로 마크에게 인사를 했다. 마크가 이 상황에 당황하지 않은 것이 참 신기했다. “성국, 동생들 때문에 지금 오도 가도 못 하는 거야?” “응.” 마크가 민국이와 지희를 내려다봤다. “와, 이 녀석들 완전 귀여워. 성국, 민국이는 꼭 너 어릴 때 같아.” “무슨 소리야. 나보다 한참 못하지.” “성국, 너 가끔 보면 나르시스트 같을 때가 있어.” “마크, 안 도와줄 거면 어서 가.” “알았어. 이따 수업 때 봐. 참, 제시가 이번 주에 자기네 기숙사에서 파티 한다고 오래. 갈 거지?” “몰라.” 나는 고개를 저었다. “안 되겠다. 소영아, 한 명씩 맡자.” “알았어.” 아빠와 엄마는 눈을 맞추고는 곧바로 지희와 민국이를 안아서 나에게서 떼어냈다. [한숨 돌렸네….] 드디어 속박에서 풀려났다. 엄마, 아빠에게 안긴 민국이와 지희는 발버둥을 쳤다. “엄마, 형아랑 같이 있을래. 나 한국 안 갈래.” “나도 엄마. 오빠랑 같이 살래.” 지희는 끝까지 떼를 썼다. 내가 나서야 할 때인가. 나는 얼른 민국이와 지희의 귀에다가 속삭였다. 그러자 민국이와 지희 모두 울음을 뚝 그쳤다. 민국이는 자신의 가방을 메더니 아빠 손을 잡았다. “아빠, 가자.” 지희도 가방을 메더니 엄마 손을 잡았다. “엄마, 나도 집에 갈래.” 아빠가 의아한 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 대체 뭐라고 한 거야?” “비밀이에요.” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “성국아, 밥 잘 챙겨 먹고.” “미국 애들 보니까 이상한 약 같은 것도 하던데, 너는 절대 그러면 안 돼.” “성국아, 나쁜 애들이랑 어울리지 말고. 알았지?” “성국아, 공부 적당히 해. 친구들이랑 놀러도 다니고….” 엄마와 아빠는 잔소리를 한 바가지 늘어놓고 공항으로 향했다. 차가 떠나고 기숙사 문을 여는데, 왠지 허전한 마음이 들었다. 세상에 또 홀로 남겨진 것 같은 기분. 하지만 세상 혼자 사는 거다. 원래…. 참, 내가 민국이랑 지희에게 뭐라고 했냐고? 형이랑 있으면 24시간 중에 4시간 자고 20시간 공부해야 한다고 했더니, 기겁을 하고 떨어졌다. [내가 재벌 될 테니, 너희들은 편하게 살아.]","completion":"Episode 101 Click. Bang Muhyuk exited the office. \\"Yejin, you haven't left yet?\\" \\"No. I feel like I did terribly today.\\" Bang Muhyuk approached. \\"Yejin, have you been crying?\\" \\"......\\" Instead of answering, Yejin nodded her head. \\"Yejin, I think you have a lot of potential but still lack a bit of confidence. I'm telling you this because you're worrying too much. You did well this month.\\" \\"Really?\\" Yejin asked, blinking her big eyes. \\"But I can't guarantee the same for next month. It's thanks to Seongguk saying you have the charm of being one of the group members. Be thankful to Seongguk.\\" [There was no need to say that...] Bang Muhyuk smiled at me for no reason. [Could it be that he thinks I have an interest in Yejin from Mandu Sang... That's not my type, Bang Muhyuk.] Yejin looked at me with a shy face. \\"Thank you.\\" \\"Yejin, you're two years older than Seongguk. Speak comfortably. He's like a younger brother.\\" \\"Yes, I'll do that next time I see him. PD-nim.\\" Bang Muhyuk quickly patted my shoulder. \\"Yejin, you go ahead, and Seongguk, come with me to the studio for a bit.\\" \\"Yes...\\" I answered weakly. Adults really do imagine and think whatever they want. [Right, I'm an adult too...] As Yejin was turning away, she quickly turned back and handed me her phone. \\"Your number...\\" \\"I don't have a phone in Korea since I'm entering the US. Sorry.\\" I put up a strong front. [Until I become a conglomerate, love is not in my dictionary.] Bang Muhyuk tapped my shoulder again. \\"Seongguk, you have an email, right?\\" Yejin looked at me with sparkling eyes. I had no choice but to write down my email address. \\"I might be too busy to reply to emails.\\" \\"I'll be a trainee next vacation, so I can see you at the company, right?\\" \\"Maybe.\\" \\"Then, see you then. Take care, PD-nim.\\" Yejin bowed 90 degrees and hurried down the stairs. Bang Muhyuk tapped my shoulder several times. \\"Seongguk, remember, our company prohibits dating among trainees. Keep that in mind.\\" \\"I don't plan to date yet.\\" I kept my defenses up until the end. * * * Bang Muhyuk handed me an MP3 player in the studio. [It's been a while since I've seen an MP3.] I looked at the MP3 player with curiosity. \\"Seongguk, this is a gift.\\" \\"A gift?\\" \\"Yes. It'll be good to listen to a lot of music if you're coming in as a trainee during the summer vacation. There are about a thousand songs in it, from my favorite music to various genres. Listen to it while you study.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"The more you listen to music, the more you'll be able to distinguish your favorite genres and naturally find out what you can sing well.\\" [Bang Muhyuk, I have no plans to become a singer. I'm going to be a conglomerate. But I'll accept the gift for now.] I smiled contentedly while looking at the MP3 player. I liked it even more because of the distinct apple shape. \\"PD-nim, I also prepared a small gift.\\" I handed over a gift I brought from home. It was a Marvel character figure I bought in the US. \\"Seongguk, this is Iron Man.\\" \\"I was wondering what to buy as a gift, so I chose this. To wish you success like Iron Man.\\" Bang Muhyuk looked at me with a touched expression. People are really moved by the little things. The warm gaze of a waiter who takes orders at eye level in a restaurant. The careful consideration of the person ahead holding the door. The touch of a flight attendant covering you with a blanket when you toss and turn on the plane. \\"Seongguk, thank you. I'll have to keep it in the studio and look at it whenever I work.\\" Bang Muhyuk quickly placed the Iron Man figure on the studio table. [This is how our relationship becomes stronger.] I smirked with satisfaction. * * * I returned to the US with my family in time for the Harvard entrance ceremony. And my entire family turned out for my Harvard entrance ceremony. \\"Mom, Dad. Here!\\" Minkuk waved his hand. Mom, Dad, Minkuk, and Jihee, all wearing Harvard T-shirts bought from the souvenir shop. [Ah... This is my family.] Of course, due to my dad's insistence, I was also wearing a T-shirt with the Harvard logo. \\"Seongguk, Dad bought a new camera this time. It has over 3 million pixels. I'll give it to you, so take pictures with your friends and send us emails often.\\" \\"Okay, Dad.\\" Although they were a bit tacky and overbearing, I had already grown accustomed to my family. Maybe this was what a normal family was like. \\"Seongguk should stand in the middle.\\" \\"Seongguk's father, let me take the picture for you.\\" \\"Thank you, teacher. After the family photo, I'll take one with Seongguk.\\" \\"Sure.\\" Grace took the camera from Dad. Chairman Koo Sooyoung and his wife also looked at our family with a pleased expression. Koo Yejeong and Yeri were also present. \\"Okay, on the count of three. Ready? One, two, three!\\" Click. * * * At a quiet restaurant near Harvard University. Chairman Koo Sooyoung and his wife, their two daughters, Grace, and Dad started their dinner together. It was a bit disappointing that Mom couldn't join because she was looking after Minkuk and Jihee, who had collapsed from running around Harvard campus all day. Chairman Koo Sooyoung looked at me with a proud face. \\"Seongguk, I'm really thankful that you've grown up so well beyond our expectations... It's so gratifying for us that the first scholarship recipient of the <Junho Foundation> has grown up so splendidly.\\" \\"I'll work even harder in the future.\\" \\"No, no, Seongguk. It's not about working harder, but now it's time for you to freely pursue the studies and work you truly want. That's what I mean.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Koo Yejeong and Yeri couldn't take their eyes off me since earlier. This popularity of mine didn't seem to wane with age. \\"Dad, isn't Seongguk a great example? Even among Harvard students, he stood out at a glance.\\" \\"Me too. I felt the same.\\" \\"Our daughters are so immature, aren't they, Seongguk's father?\\" \\"It's okay. They're just praising Seongguk.\\" Dad looked at me with a pleased expression. \\"By the way, Seongguk. You decided to be a trainee at JP, right?\\" Koo Yejeong suddenly asked. [Are you still dating that ship? News travels fast.] \\"During the vacation, I have to do various activities. I thought being a trainee would be a good experience.\\" \\"I wonder if we'll see Seongguk on TV as a singer first.\\" Chairman Koo Sooyoung laughed heartily. [Don't worry. My goal is the cover of Time or Forbes.] Yeri looked even more excited than me. \\"Dad, Seongguk might really become famous, right? Becoming a singer, an actor...\\" \\"Seongguk can really do anything in the future. Seongguk, remember that we will support whatever choice you make.\\" Chairman Koo Sooyoung looked at me with kind eyes. That was sincere. I nodded firmly. \\"Whatever choice I make, I'll show you that I won't fail.\\" * * * Although I had to enter the dormitory, my family decided to stay at a nearby accommodation for the night since they were leaving tomorrow. Dad quietly opened and closed the door to the room where Mom was sleeping. Then he lowered his voice. \\"Seongguk, Mom, Minkuk, and Jihee are all asleep. Shall we sleep together?\\" [That's creepy...] \\"Dad wants to sleep with Seongguk after a long time. What do you think?\\" [I should endure it, I guess.] I nodded. Then, tiptoeing, I headed to the next room. Dad checked my bed and then looked at me intently. \\"Seongguk, when did you grow up so much?\\" [I was always taller than Dad, just younger in age.] \\"Dad, let's sleep quickly if you're going back to Korea tomorrow.\\" \\"That's right. But Dad feels a bit sad. If we part ways with Seongguk like this, we won't see each other until the summer vacation.\\" \\"I'll come out as soon as the vacation starts.\\" \\"Seongguk, don't overdo your studies at school. Okay?\\" \\"Yes, Dad.\\" Dad patted my buttocks like he used to when I was a baby. [Dad, I'm not a baby anymore.] Suddenly, I noticed some gray hairs on Dad's head. Dad was now in his mid-30s. [When did Dad get so old?] Of course, he was still young, but the memory of a young Dad carrying me home in his early 20s was vivid in my mind. I felt a sudden surge of emotion. Really, I had trouble controlling my emotions in this life. Why were there so many moments that made me emotional? I quickly turned my head and entered the bathroom. \\"Dad, I'll shower first.\\" \\"Should Dad scrub your back, Seongguk?\\" \\"No!\\" Bang. I closed the door. [Even so, not the back.] I quickly splashed cold water on my flushed cheeks. Dad's cheerful voice came from outside. \\"Seongguk is going through puberty...\\" * * * Standing in front of the dormitory, Minkuk clung to my right leg and Jihee to my left, both wailing. \\"Brother. Brother! Let's go home with us.\\" \\"Oppa! Let's go with Jihee!\\" \\"Uwaaa!\\" \\"Uwaaaaaa!\\" Minkuk and Jihee refused to let go of me, and all of Harvard's students glanced at this scene as they passed by. [Ah, embarrassing. I guess I'm going through puberty.] I couldn't even lift my face. Then, Mark approached, laughing. \\"Seongguk!\\" Mark and I were in different rooms this time but stayed in the same dormitory building. \\"Oh, it's Mark.\\" Mom quickly recognized Mark. Mark came over and greeted my parents in Korean. \\"Mark, nice to see you.\\" Dad boldly greeted Mark in Korean. It was surprising that Mark wasn't flustered by the situation. \\"Seongguk, are you stuck because of your siblings?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Mark looked down at Minkuk and Jihee. \\"Wow, these kids are so cute. Seongguk, Minkuk really looks like you when you were young.\\" \\"What are you talking about? He's nowhere close to me.\\" \\"Seongguk, sometimes you seem like a narcissist.\\" \\"Mark, if you're not going to help, just go.\\" \\"Got it. See you in class. Oh, Jessie is having a party at her dorm this week. You're coming, right?\\" \\"I don't know.\\" I shook my head. \\"This won't do. Soyoung, let's take one each.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Mom and Dad exchanged glances and immediately picked up Jihee and Minkuk, separating them from me. [I can finally breathe...] I was finally freed from their grasp. Mom and Dad holding Minkuk and Jihee continued to struggle. \\"Mom, I want to stay with my brother. I don't want to go to Korea.\\" \\"Me too, Mom. I want to live with Oppa.\\" Jihee kept throwing a tantrum until the end. It was time for me to step in. I whispered something into Minkuk and Jihee's ears. Immediately, Minkuk and Jihee stopped crying. Minkuk grabbed his bag and held Dad's hand. \\"Dad, let's go.\\" Jihee also grabbed her bag and held Mom's hand. \\"Mom, I want to go home too.\\" Dad looked at me curiously. \\"Seongguk, what exactly did you say?\\" \\"It's a secret.\\" I shrugged. \\"Seongguk, make sure to eat well.\\" \\"I saw some American kids doing strange drugs, you should never do that.\\" \\"Seongguk, don't hang out with bad kids. Got it?\\" \\"Seongguk, don't overdo your studies. Hang out with friends too...\\" Mom and Dad gave me a load of advice and headed to the airport. As the car left and I opened the dormitory door, I felt a sense of emptiness. It was as if I was left alone in the world again. But life is meant to be lived alone. Originally... By the way, what did I whisper to Minkuk and Jihee? I told them that if they stayed with me, they would have to study 20 hours out of 24 and only sleep for 4 hours. They were so scared they ran away. [I'll become a conglomerate, so you guys can live comfortably.]"},{"prompt":"\\" Estoy cansado desde el lunes” could you give me three possible translations in french that sounds natural for native french speakers and tell me why","completion":"Certainly, translating a phrase like \\"Estoy cansado desde el lunes\\" into French in a way that sounds natural for native speakers involves considering the context and the nuances of French expressions of fatigue and duration. Here are three possible translations: 1. \\"Je suis fatigué depuis lundi.\\" 2. \\"Je me sens fatigué depuis lundi.\\" 3. \\"Je fatigue depuis lundi.\\" Here's why each of these translations might be used and why they sound natural to native French speakers: 1. **\\"Je suis fatigué depuis lundi.\\"** - This is the most direct and standard translation, closely mirroring the structure and tense of the original Spanish phrase. In French, \\"Je suis fatigué\\" directly translates to \\"I am tired,\\" and \\"depuis lundi\\" to \\"since Monday.\\" This construction is a straightforward way to express ongoing tiredness starting from a specific point in time. 2. **\\"Je me sens fatigué depuis lundi.\\"** - This translation adds a nuance by including \\"me sens\\" (feel), which makes the sentence slightly more personal and expressive about the speaker's condition. It translates to \\"I have been feeling tired since Monday.\\" This version might be used when the speaker wants to emphasize the subjective experience of tiredness rather than just stating it as a fact. 3. **\\"Je fatigue depuis lundi.\\"** - This version uses the verb \\"fatiguer\\" in a continuous sense, meaning to get tired or to wear out, and it's slightly less formal. It translates to \\"I have been getting tired since Monday\\" or \\"I am wearing out since Monday.\\" This form might be used for a slightly poetic or less formal expression, emphasizing the process of becoming tired rather than the state of being tired. All three options are grammatically correct and sound natural in French. The choice between them depends on the context and the speaker's intent: whether they are simply stating a fact, expressing their feelings, or emphasizing the ongoing nature of their tiredness."},{"prompt":"And why not \\" Je suis fatigué despuis le lundi\\"","completion":"\\"Je suis fatigué depuis le lundi\\" could potentially cause some confusion in French due to the use of \\"le\\" before \\"lundi.\\" In French, \\"depuis le lundi\\" could be understood or interpreted in a couple of ways that might not align with the intended meaning \\"since Monday.\\" 1. **Specificity and Recurrence:** The inclusion of the definite article \\"le\\" before \\"lundi\\" (Monday) can imply a recurring event or a specific Monday in the past that has a particular significance or context known to both the speaker and the listener. For example, it could be understood to mean \\"since the Monday\\" of a specific week that was previously discussed or known to the conversants, rather than simply any given Monday or the most recent Monday. 2. **Lack of Precision:** Generally, in French, when speaking about days of the week in contexts like this (expressing something that has been the case since a certain day), the article is omitted. \\"Depuis lundi\\" is understood as \\"since [last] Monday.\\" Including \\"le\\" makes the phrase sound overly specific and possibly tied to a specific, significant Monday rather than the recent past.

[역시 하버드에 오길 잘했어….] 데니스가 노트북을 가리켰다. “룸메이트가 한국에서 온 친구라고 해서 한국 영화 보고 있었어. 성국, 너도 이 영화 봤어?” 데니스가 보고 있던 영화는 <공동경비구역>이었다. “물론이지. 엄청 재미있지?” “응. 남북 상황이라는 게 이럴 수 있구나, 이런 생각도 들면서 이 감독 연출이 너무 마음에 들어.” “올 하반기에 <올드맨> 나오는데, 그 영화도 끝내줄 거야.” 저번 생에서 나는 이 감독의 차기작인 <올드맨>에 투자도 했었다. “기대되는데. 나중에 미국에도 개봉하면 같이 보러 갈래?” “좋지.” 나는 흔쾌히 찬성했다. “참, 데니스. 이번 주말에 친구 기숙사에서 파티 한다는데, 같이 갈래?” “친구?” “고등학교 친구. 제시라고.” “대박… 성국, 혹시 금발의 제시?” “제시가 그렇게 유명해?” “당연하지. 참, 참고로 너도 대박 유명해.” 데니스는 얼른 노트북으로 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 열었다. “너도 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 초기 가입자지?” “응.” [내가 개발했어, 데니스.] 하지만 나는 잠시 잠자코 있었다. 데니스는 좀 전의 조용한 모습은 사라지고, 열성적으로 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 대해서 말하기 시작했다. “고등학교 때 친구들 사이에서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 조금 유행하기 시작했거든. 그때는 공부하기 바빠서 별 관심이 없었는데, 대학 합격하고 재미 들였는데… 여기에 들어가면 나와 연결, 연결해서 공통점이 있는 사람이라면 다 연결할 수가 있어.” “제시도 거기서 찾은 거야?” “응. 학교에 하버드 입력하니까 바로 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 사용하는 올해 입학생들이 뜨더라고. 사실 거기서 너도 먼저 봤어. 성국, 너 학교 프롬킹 출신이라며?” “뭐… 그냥 운이 좋았어.” “거짓말하지 마. 너 정도면 당연히 프롬킹이지. 솔직히 내가 나중에 영화 찍는다면 이 친구에게 무슨 역할을 맡길까 그런 상상도 했다니까.” “무슨 역할 맡길 건데?” “재즈 피아니스트. 물론 주인공이야. 어때?” “멋진데…. 만약 내가 주인공 못 하면 투자는 할게.” 데니스의 차기작이었고, 그해 아카데미를 휩쓰는 영화이다. “참, 여기 제시가 있어. 네 친구가 이 제시 맞지?” “응. 이번 주 토요일이야. 같이 가자.” “당연하지.” 내가 황금 같은 주말에 제시의 파티에 가는 이유는 딱 하나였다. ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 가입자 수를 늘리기 위해서였다. [이제 슬슬 시작해볼까.] * * * “성국아, 어서 와!” 제시가 반갑게 맞았다. 마크는 이미 뒤에서 맥주를 홀짝거리고 있었다. 나는 룸메이트인 데니스와 함께 들어섰다. 그리고 제시와 마크에게 데니스를 소개했다. “제시, 마크. 여긴 내 룸메이트 데니스야.” “안녕, 반가워.” “난 제시야.” “난 마크. 성국이랑은 내가 먼저 룸메이트였어.” “‘페이스 페이퍼’에서 봤어.” 마크의 눈이 커졌다. “‘페이스 페이퍼’ 써?” “응. 고등학교 때 가입했었다가 대학 와서 많이 보고 있어. 친구들 좀 만들려고.” “그거 나랑 성국이가 만든 거야.” “진짜?!” 데니스의 목소리가 너무 커서 모두의 시선이 집중됐다. 데니스는 한껏 커진 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 왜 그걸 말 안 한 거야! 내가 그동안 너한테 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 얼마나 설명했는데!” “성국이가 장난기가 많아.” 제시가 웃으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “난 그냥 일반 사용자들이 우리 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 얼마나 쉽게 사용하는지 알고 싶어서 그랬어. 마크, 데니스가 재미있는 아이디어도 냈어.” “뭐?” “각 사용자가 연애 중인지 아닌지. 혹은 결혼했는지 같은 정보를 알 수 있게 하는 거 넣는 거 어떻냐고.” “그거 재미있겠는데. 그렇게 되면 내가 관심 있는 여자나 남자한테 편하게 연락하거나, 고백하지 않아도 상태를 아니까 포기할 수도 있잖아.” “성국, 정말 창피해. 내가 개발자 앞에서 그런 이야기를 하다니.” “아니야. 의견 잘 들었어, 데니스.” 마크는 데니스에게 맥주를 건넸다. 데니스는 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. “성국, 넌 왜 안 마셔?” “난 미성년자잖아.” “아직 생일이 안 지난 거야?” “성국아, 나이도 말 안 한 거야?” 마크가 피식 웃었다. 나는 데니스에게 미안함의 의미로 맥주 한 병을 더 안겼다. “내 몫까지 마셔줘. 이번 12일이 내 생일이야. 열두 살.” “뭐라고!!!” 데니스는 한동안 아무 말이 없었다. “잠깐, 그럼 원래는 7학년이란 말이야?” “응. 정상대로라면. 그냥 나이 말하는 게 쑥스러워서….” “네 외모에, 네 키에 열두 살이라니…. 거기다 필립 아카데미에서 프롬킹까지 하고?” “데니스, 성국이랑 지내다 보면 놀랄 일은 더 많을 거야.” 마크가 데니스의 어깨를 도닥였다. “성국, 그래서 내가 너 소개시켜 달라는 애들 다 거절하고 있단 것만 알아둬. 너보고 너무 섹시하다고 말했다가 네 나이 듣고는 범죄자 될 뻔했다고 다들 회개하고 사라졌어.” “고마워, 제시.” 이때, 주변에서 마크와 내게 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 대해서 한두 명 물어오기 시작했다. “아까 말한 ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 뭐야?” “어, 그게 뭐냐면….” 나와 마크 그리고 제시. 오늘은 데니스까지 합류해서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 대해서 열띠게 소개하기 시작했다. 그중에서 데니스의 설명은 정말 끝내줬다. “앞으로 아마 여기에 연애 중, 이런 표시도 생길 거야. 그럼, 네가 마음에 두고 있던 이성이 헤어지기라도 하면 대시하기 정말 좋잖아.” 미래의 영화감독이라 그런지 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 감성을 중심으로 설명했다. [나중에 정말 영화에 투자해야겠는걸….] 이때, 나와 마크에게 키가 큰 두 명의 남자가 걸어왔다. 얼굴도 똑같았다. [이들이 그 유명한 일란성쌍둥이 윙클 형제구나.] 나는 한눈에 그들을 알아봤다. 2m에 가까운 키에, 조정 선수까지 할 정도의 운동 능력. 금발에 파란 눈. 전형적인 미국의 엘리트 집안의 자식들이었다. 윙클 형제 중 한 명이 내게 먼저 인사를 건넸다. “안녕, 난 캐머런이야.” [정말 똑같이 생겼네….] 다행인 건 캐머런의 오른쪽 입꼬리에 작은 점이 있다는 것이었다. “난 타일러야. 네가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 만든 거야?” “나랑 마크랑 같이 만들었어. 너희들도 사용해봤어?” “어, 무척 재미있더라. 거기서 너에 대한 이야기도 많이 봤어. 천재던데?” “그 정도는 아니야.” 아이큐 121이라는 나의 아픔은 아무도 몰랐다. “열두 살에 하버드생인데, 천재가 아니면 뭐야.” 캐머런이 호탕하게 웃었다. 두 사람은 내가 생각했던 것보다는 우쭐한 모습은 없었다. “사실은 너한테 제안 하나를 하려고.” “나한테?” “응.” 타일러가 주위를 살피더니 구석으로 먼저 발길을 옮겼다. “성국, 조용한 데 가서 이야기하자.” “어, 그래.” 나는 캐머런 뒤를 따랐다. 기숙사의 복도 끝. 창문 아래에서 캐머런과 타일러가 나를 내려다보고 있었다. “성국, 하버드에 있는 파이널 클럽 이야기 들어봤어?” 물론 들어봤다. [저번 생에서 나도 하버드 다녔다고. 비록 대학원이지만….] 파이널 클럽은 하버드를 다니는 엘리트 중의 엘리트들만 들어갈 수 있는 사교 클럽이었다. 남자와 여자의 클럽이 따로 나뉘어 있었고, 그곳에 들어가기 위해서는 성적은 물론 집안도 훌륭해야 했으며, 동시에 통과의례를 꼭 치러야 했다. 나보다 한 학년 선배인 캐머런과 타일러는 파이널 클럽 중 하나의 멤버였다. [모르는 척해야지….] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “난 아직 신입생이라 잘 몰라.” “그럴 줄 알았어. 솔직히 이런 제안을 동양인에게 하는 건 처음이야. 그것만 알아둬.” 타일러가 묵직한 목소리로 말했다. 캐머런이 타일러의 말을 이었다. “나와 타일러가 속한 파이널 클럽은 ‘라이언’이라고 해. 하버드에서 가장 오래된 파이널 클럽이야. 미국에서 가장 많은 대통령을 배출한 클럽이기도 해. 그만큼 선후배 관계가 단단하다는 것도 알지?” 물론 잘 안다. 지금 현재 미국을 쥐고 흔드는 자들이 모두 이 파이널 클럽 출신이라고 해도 거짓말은 아니다. 캐머런이 봉투 하나를 내밀었다. “성국, 이건 초대장이야. 이 초대장을 받은 학생들만이 라이언 클럽에 들어올 수 있는 테스트를 치를 수가 있어. 테스트 날짜는 초대장에 적혀 있어. 뭐, 마음에 안 든다면 그날 안 나타나도 돼.” 나는 초대장을 슬쩍 열어봤다. 라이언의 상징인 깃발이 새겨져 있었고, 그 아래 날짜가 적혀 있었다. 2003년 9월 12일 금요일. 바로 내 생일이었다. * * * 마크와 데니스는 기숙사 내 방에서 신기한 눈으로 초대장을 보고 또 보고 있었다. “성국, 나는 라이언 클럽이 전설 속에만 있는 줄 알았어.” 마크는 맥주도 몇 병 마신 상태여서 이미 상기되어 있었다. 데니스도 마찬가지였다. “와, 성국. 여기 꼭 참가해. 근데 라이언 클럽의 테스트는 뭐야?” “그건 그날 알려주나 봐.” “전해지는 말에 의하면 장난 아니라고 하던데?” 데니스가 뭔가 좀 아는 것 같았다. “뭐가 있는데?” 마크가 호기심 가득한 눈으로 묻자, 데니스는 맥주를 몇 모금 더 마시고 몸을 잔뜩 앞으로 구부렸다. 손을 두 번 비비더니 귀를 쫑긋 세우고 이야기를 듣고 있는 우리를 훑었다. 데니스는 역시 전형적인 이야기꾼이었다. “나도 들은 이야기야. 보통 라이언은 초대장을 아무에게나 보내지도 않고 해마다 통과의례가 바뀌는데, 그래도 반복되는 유사성이 있대. 짝수 해에는 주로 정통적인 통과의례를 진행한대. 예를 들면, 피츠제럴드의 소설 속 캐릭터에 대한 퀴즈라든가.” “생각보다 재미없네.” 마크가 뒷짐을 졌다. “짝수 해가 보통 그렇대.” “데니스, 올해는 홀수잖아.” “그렇지, 성국. 그래서 아주 재미있을 거란 말이야.” “홀수 해에는 도대체 뭐가 미션으로 주어지는 건데?” “뭐, 하버드 정문에서 클럽까지 뛰어서 선착순으로 자른다든가. 아니면 각종 퀴즈를 내서 못 맞히면 옷을 하나씩 벗어서 마지막에 가장 옷을 많이 입고 있는 순으로 뽑힌다든가. 그래서 어떤 학생들은 라이언에 초대받으면 옷을 몇 겹을 껴입고 간대.” “그건 재미있네.” 마크도 흥미를 보였다. 나는 데니스를 쳐다봤다. “그럼, 올해는 과연 뭘까?” “글쎄.” 우리 중에 라이언의 통과의례를 아는 사람은 아무도 없었다.","completion":"Episode 102 First off, my roommate was Dennis Chazelle. Due to the characteristics of Harvard dormitories, which select roommates without considering race, region, religion, or any intersectionality, this was the result. Dennis Chazelle and I did not overlap in race, region, religion, or anything at all. The only similarity was that we both attended high school in the eastern United States. When Dennis saw me, he smiled faintly. \\"Sung-guk, have your parents left?\\" \\"Yeah. They left a while ago.\\" \\"Is the flight from Korea long?\\" \\"Yeah. It takes over 10 hours.\\" Dennis was a bit shy and spoke softly. Most of the time in the dormitory was spent watching movies on his laptop. And somehow, I felt like I knew who he was. In my previous life, I often watched movies and frequently attended world film festivals. Though I went quietly, there were many times when it was troublesome because photos were taken. About 10 years later, Dennis becomes a star in the American film industry overnight as the director of the movie <Whiplash>, which depicts the relationship between a student learning drums and a dogmatic teacher. [I really did well coming to Harvard...] Dennis pointed at his laptop. \\"Since my roommate is from Korea, I was watching a Korean movie. Sung-guk, have you seen this movie?\\" The movie Dennis was watching was <Joint Security Area>. \\"Of course. It's really fun, isn't it?\\" \\"Yeah. I thought about how the situation between the North and South could be like this, and I really liked the direction of this director.\\" \\"In the second half of the year, <Oldman> is coming out, and that movie is going to be amazing too.\\" In my previous life, I had also invested in <Oldman>, the next work of this director. \\"I'm looking forward to it. Do you want to go see it together when it's released in the US?\\" \\"Sounds good.\\" I readily agreed. \\"By the way, Dennis. There's a party at a friend's dorm this weekend, do you want to go together?\\" \\"A friend?\\" \\"A high school friend. Her name is Jessie.\\" \\"Wow... Sung-guk, is it the blonde Jessie?\\" \\"Is Jessie that famous?\\" \\"Of course. By the way, you're also quite famous.\\" Dennis quickly opened 'Face Paper' on his laptop. \\"You're also an early member of 'Face Paper', right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" [I developed it, Dennis.] But I remained silent for a moment. Dennis, who had been quiet before, started talking enthusiastically about 'Face Paper'. \\"In high school, 'Face Paper' started to become a bit popular among friends. I was too busy studying to pay much attention, but after getting accepted into college, I got into it... If you go in there, you can connect with anyone who has something in common with you.\\" \\"Did you find Jessie there?\\" \\"Yeah. When I entered Harvard as my school, all the freshmen using 'Face Paper' this year popped up. Actually, I saw you there first. Sung-guk, you were the prom king at school, right?\\" \\"Well... I was just lucky.\\" \\"Don't lie. With your looks, of course, you'd be the prom king. Honestly, I even imagined what role I would give you if I were to make a movie later.\\" \\"What role would you give me?\\" \\"A jazz pianist. Of course, the main character. How about it?\\" \\"That sounds cool... If I can't be the main character, I'll invest.\\" It was Dennis's next work, and it swept the Academy Awards that year. \\"Look, here's Jessie. This is your friend, right?\\" \\"Yeah. It's this Saturday. Let's go together.\\" \\"Of course.\\" The only reason I was going to Jessie's party on a golden weekend was to increase the number of 'Face Paper' subscribers. [Maybe it's time to start.] * * * \\"Sung-guk, welcome!\\" Jessie greeted me warmly. Mark was already sipping beer behind her. I entered with my roommate Dennis and introduced him to Jessie and Mark. \\"Jessie, Mark. This is my roommate, Dennis.\\" \\"Hi, nice to meet you.\\" \\"I'm Jessie.\\" \\"I'm Mark. I was Sung-guk's roommate before him.\\" \\"I saw you on 'Face Paper'.\\" Mark's eyes widened. \\"You use 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Yeah. I joined in high school and have been looking at it a lot since coming to college. Trying to make some friends.\\" \\"We made that, Sung-guk and I.\\" \\"Really?!\\" Dennis's voice was so loud that everyone's attention was focused on him. Dennis looked at me with wide eyes. \\"Sung-guk, why didn't you tell me! I've been explaining 'Face Paper' to you all this time!\\" \\"Sung-guk likes to joke around.\\" Jessie looked at me and laughed. \\"I just wanted to see how easily regular users could use our 'Face Paper'. Mark, Dennis had an interesting idea too.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Adding whether each user is in a relationship or not. Or if they're married, so you can know that information.\\" \\"That would be fun. Then I can easily contact or confess to the girl or guy I'm interested in without having to, or give up knowing their status.\\" \\"Sung-guk, I'm really embarrassed. I talked about that in front of the developer.\\" \\"No, Dennis. I appreciate your opinion.\\" Mark handed Dennis a beer. Dennis stared at me intently. \\"Sung-guk, why aren't you drinking?\\" \\"I'm a minor.\\" \\"Your birthday hasn't passed yet?\\" \\"Sung-guk, you didn't even tell your age?\\" Mark chuckled. I handed Dennis another beer as a gesture of apology. \\"Drink on my behalf. My birthday is on the 12th. I'm twelve.\\" \\"What!!!\\" Dennis was silent for a while. \\"Wait, so you're originally supposed to be in 7th grade?\\" \\"Yeah. Normally. I was just shy about saying my age...\\" \\"With your appearance, your height, and you were the prom king at Phillips Academy?\\" \\"Dennis, if you hang out with Sung-guk, you'll be surprised more.\\" Mark patted Dennis on the shoulder. \\"Sung-guk, so I've been rejecting all the girls who asked me to introduce them to you. They all repented and disappeared after saying you were too sexy and then hearing your age, thinking they'd become criminals.\\" \\"Thanks, Jessie.\\" At that moment, a couple of people around started asking Mark and me about 'Face Paper'. \\"What's that 'Face Paper' you mentioned earlier?\\" \\"Oh, that is...\\" Mark, Jessie, and today, even Dennis joined in enthusiastically introducing 'Face Paper'. Among them, Dennis's explanation was really something. \\"In the future, there might even be a sign indicating if you're in a relationship. Then, if the person you've been eyeing breaks up, it would be really convenient to make a move.\\" The future movie director explained 'Face Paper' with a focus on emotions. [I should really invest in his movies later...] At that moment, two tall men approached Mark and me. They had identical faces. [These must be the famous Winklevoss twins.] I recognized them at a glance. Nearly 2 meters tall, with athletic abilities enough to be rowers. Blonde hair and blue eyes. Typical children of America's elite families. One of the Winklevoss twins greeted me first. \\"Hi, I'm Cameron.\\" [They really do look alike...] Fortunately, Cameron had a small mole on the right corner of his mouth. \\"I'm Tyler. You're the one who made 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Mark and I made it together. Have you guys used it?\\" \\"Yeah, it was quite fun. We saw a lot of stories about you there. A genius, right?\\" \\"I'm not that much.\\" No one knew the pain of my IQ being 121. \\"A genius at twelve years old at Harvard, if not a genius, then what?\\" Cameron laughed heartily. The two were less arrogant than I had imagined. \\"Actually, we have a proposal for you.\\" \\"For me?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Tyler looked around and then moved to a corner first. \\"Sung-guk, let's talk somewhere quiet.\\" \\"Okay, sure.\\" I followed Cameron. At the end of the dormitory corridor. Cameron and Tyler looked down at me under the window. \\"Sung-guk, have you heard about the final clubs at Harvard?\\" Of course, I had. [I lived through a previous life. Although it was graduate school...] Final clubs were social clubs that only the elite of the elite attending Harvard could enter. There were separate clubs for men and women, and to enter, one needed not only excellent grades but also a distinguished family background, and at the same time, one had to undergo an initiation rite. Cameron and Tyler, who were a year ahead of me, were members of one of the final clubs. [Let's pretend I don't know...] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"I'm still a freshman, so I don't know much.\\" \\"I thought so. Honestly, it's the first time we're making such an offer to an Asian. Just know that.\\" Tyler spoke with a heavy voice. Cameron continued Tyler's words. \\"The final club Tyler and I belong to is called 'Lion'. It's the oldest final club at Harvard. It's also the club that has produced the most presidents in the United States. That means the senior-junior relationship is very strong, you know?\\" Of course, I knew. It wasn't a lie to say that the people who currently hold power in the United States were all from this final club. Cameron handed me an envelope. \\"Sung-guk, this is an invitation. Only students who receive this invitation can take the test to enter the Lion club. The date of the test is written on the invitation. Well, if you don't like it, you don't have to show up on that day.\\" I slightly opened the invitation. The emblem of Lion, a flag, was engraved, and below it, the date was written. September 12, 2003, Friday. It was my birthday. * * * Mark and Dennis were looking at the invitation in the dorm room with curious eyes. \\"Sung-guk, I thought the Lion club was only in legends.\\" Mark had already drunk a few beers and was flushed. Dennis was the same. \\"Wow, Sung-guk. You must participate. But what is the test for the Lion club?\\" \\"It seems they'll tell us on that day.\\" \\"According to rumors, it's no joke?\\" Dennis seemed to know something. \\"What's there?\\" When Mark asked with curious eyes, Dennis drank a few more sips of beer and leaned forward significantly. He rubbed his hands twice, perked up his ears, and scanned us, who were listening intently. Dennis was indeed a typical storyteller. \\"I've also heard stories. Normally, Lion doesn't send invitations to just anyone, and the initiation rites change every year, but there's a similarity that repeats. In even years, they usually conduct traditional initiation rites. For example, quizzes about characters in Fitzgerald's novels.\\" \\"That sounds less fun than I thought.\\" Mark crossed his arms. \\"Even years are usually like that.\\" \\"Dennis, but this year is odd.\\" \\"Right, Sung-guk. So it's going to be very interesting.\\" \\"What kind of mission is given in odd years?\\" \\"Well, for example, they might have you run from the Harvard main gate to the club and cut the line in order of arrival. Or they might give various quizzes, and if you get them wrong, you have to take off one piece of clothing, so in the end, those who are wearing the most clothes get selected.\\" \\"That sounds fun.\\" Mark also showed interest. I looked at Dennis. \\"So, what will it be this year?\\" \\"Who knows.\\" None of us knew what the initiation rite for Lion would be."},{"prompt":"Docker composer para un servicio cms wordpress y mysql","completion":"Para configurar un entorno de WordPress con MySQL usando Docker Compose, necesitarás un archivo \`docker-compose.yml\` que defina los servicios involucrados (en este caso, WordPress y MySQL), así como la red y los volúmenes necesarios para que estos servicios se comuniquen y mantengan los datos de forma persistente.

Desenvolva, sem exceder as 20 linhas, a seguinte afirmação: “[O] pleno emprego não equivale a ausência absoluta de desemprego” (Fernando Araújo)","completion":"A afirmação de Fernando Araújo que \\"[O] pleno emprego não equivale a ausência absoluta de desemprego\\" coloca em relevo uma nuance fundamental na compreensão do mercado de trabalho e das políticas econômicas voltadas para o emprego. Para desvendar essa afirmação, é preciso primeiramente distinguir entre os conceitos de \\"pleno emprego\\" e uma situação de \\"ausência absoluta de desemprego\\", conceitos que, à primeira vista, podem parecer sinônimos, mas que, sob uma análise mais cuidadosa, revelam diferenças substanciais. Pleno emprego é uma situação econômica na qual todos os indivíduos que desejam trabalhar podem encontrar emprego, mas isso não exclui a existência de um certo nível de desemprego. Esse desemprego residual é frequentemente categorizado em desemprego friccional ou voluntário, ocorrendo naturalmente na economia, à medida que pessoas trocam de empregos, ou entram e saem do mercado de trabalho. O desemprego friccional é um indicador de uma economia saudável e dinâmica, onde há liberdade para que os trabalhadores busquem posições que melhor correspondam às suas habilidades e aspirações, e para que os empregadores busquem os candidatos mais adequados. Por outro lado, a \\"ausência absoluta de desemprego\\" sugeriria uma condição utópica onde cada pessoa em idade de trabalhar estaria empregada, sem nenhuma transição entre empregos ou entradas e saídas no mercado de trabalho. Essa condição não apenas é inatingível em uma economia aberta e dinâmica, mas também poderia indicar rigidez no mercado de trabalho, onde a mobilidade do trabalho é limitada ou inexistente, podendo até mesmo sugerir a presença de políticas de emprego forçado, incompatíveis com economias de mercado livres. Portanto, a afirmação de Araújo serve como um lembrete de que o objetivo das políticas econômicas focadas no emprego não deve ser a eliminação completa do desemprego, o que seria impraticável e indesejável, mas sim a promoção de um estado de pleno emprego, onde o desemprego que existe é essencialmente friccional, refletindo uma economia dinâmica e flexível, capaz de absorver e ajustar-se à constante evolução das demandas de trabalho, ao avanço tecnológico e às mudanças no cenário econômico global."},{"prompt":"II.

Quais as consequências dessa decisão?","completion":"A adoção de um imposto de capitação (ou imposto per capita) de 1000 euros na Irlanda, como medida de resposta a uma grave crise econômica, terá consequências significativas na economia do país, tanto do ponto de vista da equidade quanto da eficiência. Um imposto de capitação é uma quantia fixa que deve ser paga por todos os indivíduos, independentemente de seus rendimentos, patrimônio ou consumo. 1. **Impacto na Equidade:** Uma das consequências mais imediatas dessa decisão é o impacto regressivo sobre a distribuição de renda. Um imposto regressivo afeta desproporcionalmente os indivíduos de menor renda, já que uma quantia fixa de 1000 euros representa uma parcela significativamente maior de seus rendimentos em comparação com indivíduos mais abastados. Isso pode agravar as desigualdades sociais e econômicas, aumentando o ônus fiscal sobre os cidadãos mais pobres, enquanto os mais ricos experimentam uma carga tributária relativamente mais leve. 2. **Efeito sobre a Demanda Agregada:** A implementação de um imposto fixo em um momento de grave crise econômica pode ter efeitos perversos sobre a demanda agregada. A redução do poder de compra, especialmente entre os consumidores de menor renda (que tendem a ter uma propensão marginal a consumir mais alta), pode resultar numa diminuição do consumo, retardando a recuperação econômica. Isso ocorre devido à redução da renda disponível das famílias, o que tende a reduzir o consumo e, consequentemente, a demanda agregada. 3. **Estímulo ao Trabalho e à Poupança:** Teoricamente, ao impor um imposto que não varia com o rendimento, poderia-se argumentar que há menos desincentivo ao trabalho ou à acumulação de riqueza, visto que o imposto é fixo independentemente dos ganhos adicionais. No entanto, dada a natureza regresiva desse tipo de imposto, o efeito líquido sobre o incentivo ao trabalho ou poupança pode ser ofuscado pelos aspectos negativos previamente mencionados, especialmente entre os grupos de renda mais baixa. 4. **Simplicidade e Custo de Administração:** Um benefício potencial de um imposto de capitação é a sua simplicidade e baixo custo de administração. Ao eliminar a necessidade de avaliar detalhadamente o rendimento ou patrimônio de cada indivíduo, reduzem-se os custos administrativos associados à cobrança de impostos. No entanto, os benefícios desta simplicidade podem ser largamente superados pelos impactos negativos sobre a equidade e a demanda agregada. Em suma, enquanto a simplificação do sistema tributário através de um imposto de capitação pode parecer atraente do ponto de vista administrativo, as consequências econômicas e sociais de tal medida, especialmente em um momento de grave crise econômica, podem ser profundamente negativas, exacerbando desigualdades e possivelmente retardando a recuperação econômica."},{"prompt":"Who is Yuntian Deng?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, specific details or notable achievements related to a person named Yuntian Deng are not widely recognized in publicly accessible global sources or media. This could imply that Yuntian Deng might be a private individual or their achievements may be known within specific, possibly academic, scientific, artistic, or other professional fields that have not been broadly covered by mainstream media or widely recognized public databases. It's also possible that Yuntian Deng may have contributions or roles in specialized areas which require domain-specific databases or networks to access detailed information about their work or achievements. Without additional context about their field of work or contributions, it's challenging to provide a precise overview of their identity or accomplishments. If Yuntian Deng is involved in a specific field such as science, technology, education, arts, or any other area, I recommend consulting academic journals, professional networks, or industry-specific publications for more detailed information."},{"prompt":"\\"depuis le lundi\\" or \\"depuis lundi\\"? Which one is right?","completion":"Both \\"depuis le lundi\\" and \\"depuis lundi\\" can be correct depending on the context. - \\"Depuis lundi\\" means \\"since Monday\\" and is used to refer to a specific week. For example, if today is Thursday and you want to say something has been happening since the beginning of this week, you would use \\"depuis lundi.\\" - \\"Depuis le lundi\\" is less commonly used and can imply a repetition or a general statement starting from Mondays. For example, it could be used in a context where someone describes a routine or a repeated occurrence starting from Mondays over an unspecified or specified period. However, it might often be seen as more natural to simply say \\"depuis lundi\\" to refer to events or actions occurring since the most recent Monday or to use additional context for repeating events (like specifying \\"depuis le lundi de chaque semaine\\"). In everyday conversation referring to events since the most recent Monday, \\"depuis lundi\\" is the preferred and more natural choice."},{"prompt":"Could you give me examples please","completion":"Certainly! Here are examples for both \\"depuis lundi\\" and \\"depuis le lundi\\" to illustrate their use in context. # Depuis lundi **Depuis lundi, il pleut sans arrêt.** - Translation: It has been raining nonstop since Monday. This sentence is referring to a specific week. If today is, say, Thursday, this means it has been raining continuously from Monday to Thursday. **Je n'ai pas vu Tom depuis lundi.** - Translation: I haven't seen Tom since Monday. Here, the speaker is referring to the most recent Monday that has passed, indicating that they haven't seen Tom at any point after that day. # Depuis le lundi This construction is less common and might be used in more specific contexts. However, interpreting it generally involves a bit more context or specificity, as it can seem slightly awkward without additional information. A more natural way to convey similar meanings could involve different prepositions or specific conditions, but let's adapt this as closely as possible. **Depuis le lundi, elle s'entraîne tous les jours pour le marathon.** - Translation: Since Monday (in a specific context, like the start of a training phase), she trains every day for the marathon. In this example, one would expect additional context around \\"le lundi\\" to make it clear it's a specific Monday being referred to, such as the beginning of a training schedule. Note: The phrase \\"depuis le lundi\\" might be less naturally used without specifying which Monday or without additional context because it suggests a level of specificity that requires clarification. Instead, for recurring events, French speakers might say: **Elle s'entraîne tous les jours depuis lundi de chaque semaine.** - Translation: She trains every day starting from Monday of each week. Or more naturally: **Chaque semaine, elle commence à s'entraîner le lundi.** - Translation: Every week, she starts training on Monday. Remember, the use of \\"le\\" in \\"depuis le lundi\\" generally implies a specificity or repetition that needs clarification either through additional context or a more precise description."},{"prompt":"An acceptable noise criterion rating for the background conference room -41(0.0997)**0+31 gives the estimated sound pressure level decibels, as a function of the octave band centre frequency hertz, where x260. context? 25 for a noise crilerion rating of 25 equation Which of the following is the best interpretation in this a. 3 lis 41 less than the estimated sound préssure level , in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 60 hertz b. 31is 41 less than the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 0 hertz c. 3lis the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 60 hertz d. 41 is the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 0 hertz","completion":"Given the equation for estimating sound pressure level in decibels as a function of the octave band centre frequency (hertz), let's evaluate the options provided: The equation given is: [ text{Sound Pressure Level (SPL)} = 41(0.0997)^0 + 31 ] Let's break down the components of this equation: - The term (41(0.0997)^0) makes use of the fact that any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Thus, (41(0.0997)^0) simplifies to (41 times 1), which is just (41). - The equation thus simplifies to (41 + 31), totaling (72). This result doesn't change with the frequency ((x)) because the frequency variable was not included in this specific calculation. Given this context, let's evaluate the interpretations: a. 3 is 41 less than the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 60 hertz - This statement is incorrect because it incorrectly states the relationship between the numbers and does not relate correctly to the calculation or the nature of the equation provided. b. 31 is 41 less than the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 0 hertz - This statement is incorrect because it misinterprets the components of the equation and incorrectly suggests a relationship between 31 and 41 regarding the sound pressure level. c. 31 is the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 60 hertz - This interpretation is incorrect because it cites 31 as the estimated level without considering the full calculation, which actually totals to 72 when following the equation as intended. d. 41 is the estimated sound pressure level, in decibels, at an octave band centre frequency of 0 hertz - This statement is incorrect because the interpretation of the equation results leads to a misunderstanding. The equation's parameters lead to a fixed result of 72 dB, not 41, regardless of the octave band centre frequency since the frequency variable does not play a part in this particular equation. None of the options provided accurately interprets the equation based on the given operation and result. The correct interpretation - based on the calculation provided (41 + 31) - would indicate that the estimated sound pressure level is 72 decibels, which does not depend on the octave band center frequency as per the specific equation detailed. Since none of the options match this correct interpretation, they are all incorrect based on the calculation explained above."},{"prompt":"Adivinanzas","completion":"Claro, las adivinanzas son una manera divertida de poner a prueba nuestra mente.

[피터, 나 겉모습만 열두 살이야. 나 전직 재벌 출신인 거 알면 놀랄걸.] * * * 윙클 형제는 당황한 얼굴로 성국을 찾았다. “성국이가 도대체 누구랑 나간 거야?” “피터 브랜튼.” 이때, 윙클 형제의 아버지인 데이먼 윙클이 끼어들었다. “아버지. 피터 브랜튼이라면?” “그 유명한 투자 전문가. 아마조네스부터 시작해서 투자한 기업은 모두 성공했다는 투자의 신.” “설마 성국이 피터 브랜튼을 알고 접근한 걸까?” “피터 브랜튼은 좋은 투자자이긴 하지만, 너무 신중하다는 평이 많아. 리스크를 최대한 줄이기 위해서 신중하게 접근하는 대신 느린 거지. 그러다 좋은 기업을 몇 번 놓치기도 했어. 아마 ‘페이스 페이퍼’도 그렇게 접근할 거야. 그 전에 우리가 공격적으로 접근해야지.” 타일러가 근심 어린 얼굴로 위스키를 마셨다. “근데 아버지… 왠지 전 성국이가 이 상황을 다 요리하는 것 같은 느낌이 들어요.” “걱정 마. 열두 살짜리가 무슨 요리를 하겠어. 마크라는 애는 순전히 개발자라며?” “네. 비즈니스는 성국이가 다 하는 거 같은데… 애 같지가 않단 말이에요. 전혀.” “타일러, 걱정은 접어두고 우리는 성국이에게 어떤 좋은 미끼를 줄지만 생각하자.” * * * 학교 앞 허름한 햄버거 가게. 피터는 그곳에서도 가장 싼 버거 두 개를 시켰다. “대학 때는 돈이 없어서 맨날 이것만 먹었는데… 이제는 이게 그리운 맛이 됐어.” “맛있어 보이는데요.” 나는 한 입 크게 깨물었다. 육즙 가득한 패티와 싸구려 체다 치즈의 맛이 무척 느끼했다. 나는 얼른 콜라를 마셨다. “여기서 이렇게 재미있는 인연을 만나게 될 거라고는 생각도 못 했어.” “라이언 클럽 모임에는 언제 오고 안 오신 거예요?” “사실… 졸업하고 올해 처음 온 거야. 매해 이맘때면 엄청 바빠서 도저히 올 시간이 안 됐거든. 연말 파티 때는 몇 번 갔는데… 학교 다닐 때도 클럽 녀석들 잘난 척이 너무 심해서 견디기 힘들었는데, 나이가 들어도 변하는 게 없더라고.” “피터도 라이언 클럽이었으면 그 잘난 척 무리 중 한 명 아니에요?” “난 너랑 비슷해.” 피터는 빙긋 웃었다. 나랑 비슷하다고? 마크가 보내준 피터의 프로필에 의하면 피터는 미국 내에서도 금수저 집안 출신이던데…. “저랑 비슷한 게 하나도 없어 보이는데요.” “나는 물론 부모님이 모두 하버드 교수셨고.” [뭐가 비슷하단 말인가, 피터.] 나는 햄버거를 크게 한 입 깨물었다. “고등학교 1년을 월반해서 다른 애들보다 한 살이 어렸어. 너랑 비교할 건 아니지만. 부모님이 명망 있는 분들이시긴 했는데, 두 분 다 검소하셔서 여기 라이언 클럽 애들이랑은 솔직히 경제적인 차이가 많이 났어. 처음엔 오래된 클럽이다 보니 초대장 받은 게 좋았는데… 지내다 보니 나랑 잘 안 맞더라고.” 피터는 천진난만하게 웃었다. 40대 중반의 나이에도 천진난만하게 웃을 수 있다는 건, 가면일까? “성국은 라이언 클럽에 왜 들어온 거야?” “호기심이요.” “호기심?” “네. 이 폐쇄적인 클럽에서 동양인인 저를 초대한 이유가 뭔지 알고 싶기도 했고요.” “‘페이스 페이퍼’라면 다 설명될 것 같은데…. 참, 나 거기 바로 가입하고 싶은데, 어떻게 가입하는 거야?” “흠….” 나는 주변을 둘러봤다. 컴퓨터를 쓸 만한 곳이 보이지도 않았고, 한국처럼 PC방이 있지도 않았다. “피터, 마크 한번 만나 보실래요?” “마크?” “제 사업 파트너요.” * * * 달칵. 기숙사 문을 열고 들어서자 마크와 데니스가 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 나는 마크와 데니스에게 피터를 소개했다. “여기는 피터 브랜튼 씨라고 유명한 투자자셔. 피터, 이 친구가 저랑 사업 같이하는 마크 주크버스요.” “반갑네, 마크.” “여기는 제 룸메이트 데니스 샤젤이요. 영화감독 지망생이에요.” “반갑네, 데니스.” 모두 반갑게 인사를 나누었다. “마크, 피터가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 가입하고 싶으시다는데 도와줄 수 있지?” “물론이죠. 피터, 이쪽으로 오세요.” 피터는 마크의 인도로 컴퓨터 앞에 앉았다. “마크, 잘 부탁해. 난 자네들처럼 컴퓨터에 익숙하진 않거든.” “저만 믿으세요.” “성국이 그러던데, 자네랑 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 같이 개발한 거라고 하더라고.” “네.” “역시 멋진 친구 곁에는 멋진 친구가 있는 법이네.” 그 말에 마크는 입이 헤벌쭉 벌어졌다. 피터는 역시 사람을 잘 다룰 줄 알았다. 사람들은 외모부터 시작해서 모든 게 우월한 나를 주목하지 마크에 대해서는 별로 주목하지 않았다. 내가 아무리 마크가 프로그램 개발자라고 해도 질문은 모두 나에게 던졌다. 그것 때문에 마크는 종종 서운해할 때도 있었지만, 자신이 남들 앞에 나서는 것을 싫어하는 성격이라 별 내색은 하지 않았다. 피터는 그런 작은 부분조차 놓치지 않았다. 마크는 피터에게 상세하게 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 사용법을 알려줬다. “결혼하셨죠?” “이혼했으니, 다시 돌아왔지.” “여자 친구는요?” “찾는 중인데….” “그럼, 여기 연애 중인지 아닌지 표시도 할 수 있어요.” “이거 재미있는데….” 피터도 쉽게 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 적응했다. “그러곤 저랑 성국이, 데니스에게 친구 신청을 하셔서 저희가 수락하면 저희 친구들도 모두 알 수 있어요.” “그렇게 인맥을 넓히는 거구나?” “네.” “직관적이면서 젊은이들이 좋아할 수밖에 없겠어.” 피터는 만족스러운 표정을 지었다. 나와 데니스, 마크는 맞은편 컴퓨터로 피터의 친구 신청을 모두 수락했다. 피터는 재미난 듯 자신이 지금 하버드의 신입생 기숙사에 있단 짧은 글을 써서 올렸다. “내가 있는 위치도 다 표시가 되네.” “만약 친구들이 그 근처에 있으면 서로 만날 수도 있는 거죠.” “우리같이 노땅들은 미리 전화해서 어디서 몇 시에 만날지 정해야 하는데… 이거 정말 신세계네.” 마크와 나는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 기능을 열정적으로 설명했다. 마크가 기술을 설명했다면, 나는 감성을 담당했다. 피터도 쉽게 기능을 익히고 글도 몇 개 더 올렸다. 그사이 피터에게도 친구 신청이 몇 들어왔다. - 설마 그 유명한 투자의 신, 피터 브랜튼? 피터는 잠시 고민하다가 질문에 답을 달았다. - 네, 맞습니다. 피터가 우리를 뒤돌아봤다. “너무 정중한가? 요즘 인터넷에서 이렇게 정중한 표현은 잘 안 쓰지?” “그게 또 매력이죠.” “그래, 난 40대니까.” * * * 피터는 나와 어둑한 하버드 교정을 거닐었다. “내 기사가 조금 후에 여기로 도착할 거야. 성국, ‘페이스 페이퍼’로 창업을 생각 중이야?” “네.” “창업이라는 거, 쉽지 않을 거야.” “알고 있어요.” “어쩌면 학교를 그만둬야 할 수도 있어.” “그 정도 각오도 되어 있어요.” 피터는 잠시 멈춰 섰다. “마이크로 세이버사에서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 사겠다고 한 건 그만큼 이 아이디어를 높게 산 걸 거야. 하지만 아마 너와 마크에 대해서는 직접 경영을 하기에는 불안정하다고 판단했을 거야.” [일부는 맞고, 일부는 틀려. 피터.] 피터는 말을 이었다. “성국, 투자자 입장에서 보면 솔직히 나도 그 부분이 아직 가장 신뢰할 수 없는 부분이야.” “제가 그걸 어떻게 증명하죠?” “글쎄.” 나는 곰곰이 생각하다 이런 아이디어를 떠올렸다. “피터, 한 달 동안 30달러로 살아볼게요.” “어?” 피터가 조금 놀란 눈치였다. “창업이라는 게 생각보다 아름답지도 않고 힘든 일이잖아요. 어쩌면 이 일로 전 파산할지도 모르잖아요.” “그렇지….” “한 달 동안 30달러로 살 수만 있다면 창업 초기의 어려움도 얼마든지 이겨 나갈 수 있지 않을까요?” “흠… 그 말도 맞지만, 창업이라는 게 견디기만 한다고 이길 수 있는 싸움은 또 아니야. 초반에는 얼마나 많은 가능성을 가졌는지가 중요하고, 이후에는 그걸 투자자들에게 보여주는 것이 더 중요해.” “한 달 동안 30달러로 살기로 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 가능성도 보여 드릴게요.” 피터가 고개를 갸웃했다. “정말? 그게 가능하겠어?” “물론이죠!” 나는 장담했다. 피터가 고개를 갸웃했다. “성국, 나한테 증명해 보이겠단 것은 내 투자를 받고 싶단 말이지?” “물론 여러 군데 사모펀드가 접근해오긴 했어요. 하지만 전 가장 공정하게 저희를 대해줄 투자자를 찾고 있거든요.” “그게 바로 나란 말이지?” “네.” 피터가 빙긋 웃으며 손을 내밀었다. 나는 그 손을 잡았다. “좋아, 성국. 한번 증명해봐.” * * * 마크가 어이없는 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 미쳤어? 한 달 동안 30달러로 살겠다고? 하루에 1달러만 쓰고? 그리고 그걸 우리보고 감시하라고?” “응.” “하버드가 아무리 학생들에게 후하다고 해도 그건 불가능하지.” 데니스도 부정적이었다. “이 근처에서 제일 싼 마트가 어디지?” “그건 왜?” “30일 동안 먹을 식량을 사두게. 그거면 될 것 같아.” 마크와 데니스는 혀를 내둘렀다. 그러면서도 가장 싼 마트를 검색했다. “성국, 3마일 떨어진 데 할인마트가 있어.” 나는 마크와 데니스를 쳐다봤다. “두 사람이 도와주면 될 것 같은데. 공짜로….” “성국, 우리가 꼭 피터의 투자를 받아야 할 이유는 없잖아.” “마크, 내가 며칠 동안 피터에 대해서 더 자세히 조사해봤어. 피터 이름 밑에 달린 댓글들 못 봤어?” “맞아, 마크. 투자의 신이라고 했어.” “그 말인즉슨, 피터가 투자한다는 것만으로도 우리 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 가치는 올라간다는 말이야.” “성국은 정말 말릴 수가 없어. 데니스, 장바구니 챙기자.” “그래.” 모두들 장바구니를 들고 마트로 향했다. * * * 오렌지가 10달러에 30개. 냉동 핫도그가 30개에 10달러. 나는 두 가지 품목을 집어서 계산했다. 그러고도 10달러가 남았다. “성국, 정말 이것만 먹고 살 수 있어?” “10달러 남았잖아. 가끔 우유도 사 먹으면 되지.” 마크가 혀를 내둘렀다.","completion":"Episode 105 I had deliberately avoided Cameron and Tyler, but they caught me talking to Peter Branton and calmly walked over. I quietly spoke to Peter. \\"Would it be okay if we talk quietly?\\" \\"I wanted to say that. Actually, I'm not really fitting in at this Ryan Club freshman party.\\" Peter and I quietly slipped out of the clubhouse before Cameron and Tyler arrived. Peter let out a long sigh. \\"You shouldn't do things you're not used to. I usually don't come to these parties. I stopped by this time because I had some business in Boston, but it seems I came for a good reason.\\" [Hmm… First level of caution.] I kept my response to Peter's words to a minimum. \\"Can I join that 'Face Paper' too?\\" \\"Of course. Currently, it's mainly used by students from the boarding school I attended and Harvard, but the user base has expanded since I joined Harvard.\\" \\"I wonder if an old guy like me could join.\\" \\"Age doesn't matter when making new friends.\\" Peter seemed to like my response. \\"Like us?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I nodded. \\"That suit looks nice. Where did you buy it?\\" \\"It's my friend's. My suit got too small, so I can't wear it anymore.\\" \\"Of course… You're at the age of growth. I'm hungry; how about we go to a burger place I used to frequent during my school days for dinner?\\" \\"Sounds good.\\" I followed Peter. Peter seemed like a friendly neighbor, but in reality, this was a highly calculated move. Approaching me friendly to learn about 'Face Paper' and trying to build a connection with me. [Peter, I may look twelve on the outside, but I'm a former conglomerate heir. You'd be surprised if you knew.] * * * The Winklevoss twins looked for Sunguk with puzzled faces. \\"Who did Sunguk go out with?\\" \\"Peter Branton.\\" At that moment, Damon Winklevoss, the father of the Winklevoss twins, joined the conversation. \\"Father. Peter Branton?\\" \\"That famous investment expert. From Amazoness and on, every company he's invested in has been a success. He's known as the god of investment.\\" \\"Could Sunguk have known Peter Branton and approached him?\\" \\"Peter Branton is a good investor, but he's known for being too cautious. He approaches slowly to minimize risks, which has caused him to miss out on good companies a few times. He'll probably approach 'Face Paper' the same way. We need to be more aggressive before that.\\" Tyler drank his whiskey with a worried face. \\"But father… Somehow, I feel like Sunguk is handling this situation.\\" \\"Don't worry. What can a twelve-year-old cook up? Mark is purely a developer, right?\\" \\"Yes. But it seems like Sunguk is handling all the business… He doesn't seem like a kid at all.\\" \\"Tyler, let's not worry and think about what good bait we can offer Sunguk.\\" * * * At a shabby burger shop in front of the school. Peter ordered the two cheapest burgers there. \\"I used to eat only this because I had no money during college... Now, it's a nostalgic taste.\\" \\"It looks delicious.\\" I took a big bite. The patty was juicy, and the cheap cheddar cheese was quite greasy. I quickly drank some cola. \\"I never thought I'd make such an interesting connection here.\\" \\"When did you start coming to the Ryan Club meetings?\\" \\"Actually... This is my first time coming since graduation. I've been too busy around this time every year. I went to a few end-of-year parties... Even when I was in school, the club guys were too pretentious, and it was hard to bear. They haven't changed even as they've aged.\\" \\"Weren't you part of the Ryan Club, making you one of those pretentious guys?\\" \\"I'm similar to you.\\" Peter smiled. Similar to me? According to the profile Mark sent me, Peter comes from a wealthy family in the US... \\"I don't see how we're similar at all.\\" \\"My parents were both Harvard professors.\\" [How are we similar, Peter?] I took another big bite of my burger. \\"I skipped a year in high school, so I was a year younger than the other kids. Not that it's comparable to you. My parents were respected, but they were frugal, so honestly, there was a significant economic difference between me and these Ryan Club kids. At first, I was happy to receive an invitation from an old club... But as I spent time there, I realized it wasn't a good fit for me.\\" Peter smiled innocently. Can someone in their mid-forties smile so innocently, or is it a mask? \\"Why did you join the Ryan Club?\\" \\"Curiosity.\\" \\"Curiosity?\\" \\"Yes. I was also curious why this exclusive club invited me, an Asian.\\" \\"'Face Paper' might explain that... By the way, I want to join right away. How do I do that?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I looked around. There was no computer in sight, nor were there PC cafes like in Korea. \\"Peter, would you like to meet Mark?\\" \\"Mark?\\" \\"My business partner.\\" * * * Click. As I entered the dormitory, Mark and Dennis sprang up from their seats. I introduced Peter to Mark and Dennis. \\"This is Mr. Peter Branton, a famous investor. Peter, this is Mark Zuckerberg, my business partner.\\" \\"Pleased to meet you, Mark.\\" \\"And this is my roommate, Dennis Chazelle, an aspiring film director.\\" \\"Pleased to meet you, Dennis.\\" Everyone exchanged pleasantries. \\"Mark, Peter wants to join 'Face Paper.' Can you help him?\\" \\"Of course. Peter, please come this way.\\" Peter sat in front of the computer, led by Mark. \\"Mark, I'm counting on you. I'm not as familiar with computers as you guys.\\" \\"Trust me.\\" \\"Sunguk mentioned that you developed 'Face Paper' together.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"It's true that great friends have great friends.\\" Mark's mouth dropped open at that comment. Peter knew how to handle people well. People paid attention to me because of my superior appearance and everything else, but they didn't pay much attention to Mark. Even though I always mentioned that Mark was the developer of the program, questions were always directed at me. Mark sometimes felt left out because of this, but since he disliked being in the spotlight, he didn't show it much. Peter didn't miss even these small details. Mark explained in detail how to use 'Face Paper' to Peter. \\"Are you married?\\" \\"I'm divorced, so I'm back on the market.\\" \\"Any girlfriend?\\" \\"Looking for one...\\" \\"Then, you can also indicate whether you're in a relationship or not here.\\" \\"This is interesting...\\" Peter quickly adapted to 'Face Paper.' \\"Then, Peter, you can send friend requests to me, Sunguk, and Dennis, and once we accept, all our friends can see it too.\\" \\"That's how you expand your network?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"It's intuitive and something young people would definitely like.\\" Peter looked satisfied. Mark, Dennis, and I accepted Peter's friend requests from the opposite computer. Peter, amused, posted a short message saying he was currently at a Harvard freshman dorm. \\"My location is also displayed.\\" \\"If your friends are nearby, you can meet up.\\" \\"For us old folks, we usually have to call ahead to decide where and when to meet... This is truly a new world.\\" Mark and I passionately explained the features of 'Face Paper.' While Mark explained the technology, I handled the emotional aspect. Peter quickly learned the features and posted a few more messages. In the meantime, Peter received a few friend requests. - Could it be the famous investment god, Peter Branton? After a moment of hesitation, Peter replied to the question. - Yes, that's correct. Peter turned to us. \\"Is this too formal? People don't usually use such formal expressions on the internet these days, do they?\\" \\"That's part of its charm.\\" \\"Well, I'm in my forties.\\" * * * Peter and I walked through the dimly lit Harvard campus. \\"My car will arrive here shortly. Sunguk, are you considering starting a business with 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Starting a business isn't easy.\\" \\"I'm aware.\\" \\"You might even have to drop out of school.\\" \\"I'm prepared for that.\\" Peter stopped for a moment. \\"MicroSaver saying they want to buy 'Face Paper' means they value the idea highly. But they probably judged that you and Mark are too unstable to manage it directly.\\" [Partly right, partly wrong, Peter.] Peter continued. \\"Sunguk, from an investor's perspective, honestly, that's still the most unreliable part for me.\\" \\"How can I prove it?\\" \\"Well.\\" I thought hard and came up with an idea. \\"Peter, I'll live on 30 for a month.\\" \\"What?\\" Peter seemed a bit surprised. \\"Starting a business isn't as glamorous as it seems and is tough. Maybe I'll even go bankrupt because of this.\\" \\"That's true...\\" \\"If I can live on 30 for a month, I can overcome the initial difficulties of starting a business, right?\\" \\"Hmm... That makes sense, but starting a business isn't just about enduring. It's important to have as many possibilities as possible at the beginning, and later, it's more important to show those to the investors.\\" \\"I'll show the potential of 'Face Paper' by living on 30 for a month.\\" Peter tilted his head. \\"Really? Is that possible?\\" \\"Of course!\\" I assured him. Peter tilted his head. \\"Sunguk, are you saying you want to prove this to get my investment?\\" \\"Several private equity firms have approached us. But I'm looking for an investor who will treat us most fairly.\\" \\"That would be me?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Peter smiled and extended his hand. I shook it. \\"Alright, Sunguk. Let's see you prove it.\\" * * * Mark looked at me incredulously. \\"Sunguk, are you crazy? Living on 30 for a month? Spending only 1 a day? And you want us to monitor that?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Even if Harvard is generous to its students, that's impossible.\\" Dennis was also skeptical. \\"Where's the cheapest supermarket around here?\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"To stock up on food for 30 days. That should do it.\\" Mark and Dennis rolled their eyes. Yet, they searched for the cheapest supermarket. \\"Sunguk, there's a discount mart 3 miles away.\\" I looked at Mark and Dennis. \\"If you two help, it should be doable. For free...\\" \\"Sunguk, we don't necessarily need Peter's investment.\\" \\"Mark, I've researched more about Peter these past few days. Didn't you see the comments under Peter's name?\\" \\"Right, Mark. They called him the god of investment.\\" \\"That means, just the fact that Peter is investing would increase the value of our 'Face Paper.'\\" \\"Sunguk is really unstoppable. Dennis, let's grab the shopping cart.\\" \\"Alright.\\" Everyone grabbed their shopping carts and headed to the mart. * * * Oranges, 30 for 10. Frozen hot dogs, 30 for 10. I picked these two items and paid. And I still had 10 left. \\"Sunguk, can you really live on just this?\\" \\"I still have 10 left. I can buy milk occasionally.\\" Mark rolled his eyes."},{"prompt":"O que é CPF na nota quando vou comprar algo","completion":"\\"CPF na nota\\" é uma iniciativa presente em diversos estados brasileiros, também conhecido como \\"Nota Fiscal Paulista\\" em São Paulo, \\"Nota Fiscal Gaúcha\\" no Rio Grande do Sul, entre outros nomes a depender da região. Esse programa permite que o consumidor inclua seu Cadastro de Pessoa Física (CPF) na nota fiscal no momento da compra. A iniciativa tem múltiplos objetivos: 1. **Combate à sonegação fiscal:** Ao incluir o CPF na nota, o registro da venda se torna obrigatório, garantindo que o imposto devido seja corretamente recolhido pelo estabelecimento comercial. Isso ajuda o governo a combater a sonegação de impostos. 2. **Benefícios ao consumidor:** Ao participar do programa, o consumidor pode receber parte do ICMS (Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços) recolhido pela operação de volta, geralmente na forma de créditos. Esses créditos podem ser utilizados para abater no IPVA, transferidos para conta corrente ou poupança, ou ainda, em alguns casos, para créditos em celulares pré-pagos. 3. **Promoção de sorteios:** Além dos créditos, alguns programas realizam sorteios de prêmios em dinheiro para os consumidores que pedem o CPF na nota, incentivando ainda mais a adesão ao programa. 4. **Monitoramento de gastos:** Outra vantagem é a possibilidade de monitorar as próprias compras, uma vez que o consumidor pode acessar eletronicamente os documentos fiscais vinculados ao seu CPF. Para participar, o consumidor normalmente precisa se cadastrar no site do programa do seu respectivo estado, informando seus dados pessoais e o número do CPF. Após o cadastro, sempre que realizar uma compra, deve solicitar a inclusão do seu CPF na nota fiscal. Com essa simples ação, além de contribuir para a redução da sonegação fiscal, o consumidor pode acumular créditos e concorrer a prêmios."},{"prompt":"Influi alguma coisa no meu score?","completion":"Incluir o CPF na nota fiscal ao realizar compras (participando de programas como o Nota Fiscal Paulista, Nota Fiscal Gaúcha, entre outros) não influencia diretamente o seu score de crédito. O score de crédito é uma pontuação calculada por agências de crédito (como Serasa e SPC no Brasil) baseada no histórico de crédito do consumidor, ou seja, como ele lida com suas dívidas e obrigações financeiras. Ele é utilizado por instituições financeiras e comerciantes para avaliar o risco de inadimplência ao conceder crédito ou empréstimos. Os principais fatores que afetam o seu score de crédito incluem: 1. **Histórico de Pagamento:** Se você paga suas contas em dia, isso tem um impacto positivo no seu score. Atrasos e inadimplências têm o efeito contrário. 2. **Uso do Crédito:** Como você usa o seu crédito disponível também influencia. Altos saldos em cartões de crédito ou estar constantemente no limite do seu crédito pode ser visto negativamente. 3. **Histórico de Crédito:** Quanto mais longo for o seu histórico de uso responsável do crédito, melhor para o seu score. 4. **Novas Solicitações de Crédito:** Fazer muitas solicitações de crédito em um curto período de tempo pode sinalizar que você está em uma situação financeira difícil, o que pode reduzir seu score. 5. **Diversidade de Crédito:** Ter diferentes tipos de crédito (como empréstimo pessoal, financiamento imobiliário, cartão de crédito) e gerenciá-los bem pode ser positivo para o seu score. Portanto, pedir o CPF na nota fiscal ao fazer compras é uma prática que beneficia tanto o consumidor, através de créditos e prêmios, quanto o governo, no combate à sonegação fiscal. No entanto, essa ação não está diretamente relacionada ao cálculo do seu score de crédito, que é mais focado no seu comportamento como consumidor de produtos e serviços financeiros."},{"prompt":"estoy usando springboot un crud en memoria pero quiero modificar mis excepciones en actualizar, que me devuelva el objeto actualizao 202 ok y si hay un error 404 por id no encontrado, me devuelva un solo mensaje de una linea - @RequestMapping(value=\\"/actualizar/{id}\\", method=RequestMethod.PUT, headers=\\"Accept=application/json\\") public @ResponseBody String actualizarProducto(@PathVariable(\\"id\\") Long id, @RequestBody Producto producto) { Producto obj = repository.findById(id); if(obj!=null) { producto.setId_producto(id); repository.update(producto); return \\"Producto actualizado\\"; } return \\"Producto no encontrado con el ID: \\" + id; }","completion":"Para lograr lo que deseas, primero se deben hacer algunos cambios en tu método para poder controlar adecuadamente los códigos de estado HTTP en las respuestas.

Esto permite devolver tanto el cuerpo de la respuesta como el código de estado HTTP. - En el caso exitoso, se usa \`ResponseEntity.ok(producto)\` para devolver el producto actualizado junto con el código de estado 200 (OK), aunque podrías utilizar \`ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED).body(producto)\` si prefieres explícitamente retornar un 202 (Accepted). - En el caso de error, se utiliza \`ResponseEntity.notFound()\` para generar una respuesta con el código de estado 404 (Not Found). Nota que, debido a tu requerimiento de retornar un mensaje de error de una sola línea, se eliminó el mensaje personalizado para simplificar y adherir a la práctica común de no enviar cuerpos en las respuestas 404. Si necesitas absolutamente enviar un mensaje, podrías ajustar la construcción de la respuesta para incluir un cuerpo, aunque es menos común para el caso de un 404. Este enfoque aumenta la flexibilidad y la claridad de tu API, permitiendo a los clientes manejar tanto los casos de éxito como los de error de una manera más estructurada."},{"prompt":"<parent> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId> <version>3.2.4</version> <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository --> </parent> - tengo ese esrror en parent a que se debe?","completion":"Si estás encontrando un error en la sección \`<parent>\` de tu archivo \`pom.xml\` al especificar la versión \`3.2.4\` para \`spring-boot-starter-parent\`, puede deberse a varias razones. A continuación, listo algunas posibles causas y cómo podrías abordarlas: 1. **Versión no existente:** Asegúrate de que la versión \`3.2.4\` de Spring Boot realmente exista en el momento de tu consulta. A veces, puede ocurrir un error tipográfico al escribir la versión, o es posible que estés intentando utilizar una versión que aún no ha sido publicada. Puedes verificar las versiones disponibles de Spring Boot en el [repositorio Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/). 2. **Configuración del repositorio Maven:** Si la versión existe pero aún encuentras problemas, verifica tu configuración de Maven para asegurarte de que estás apuntando a los repositorios correctos donde Spring Boot podría estar alojado. Normalmente, Spring Boot se encuentra disponible en Maven Central, pero algunas empresas utilizan repositorios privados o proxies que podrían no estar actualizados o correctamente configurados. Para configurar Maven para usar Maven Central (lo cual normalmente no es necesario, ya que es el comportamiento predeterminado), puedes asegurarte de tener algo como esto en tu \`pom.xml\` o en tu \`settings.xml\` de Maven: \`\`\`xml <repositories> <repository> <id>central</id> <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url> </repository> </repositories> \`\`\` 3. **Problemas de red o cortafuegos:** En ocasiones, un firewall corporativo o problemas de configuración de red pueden impedir que Maven acceda a los repositorios externos. Verifica que puedas acceder a Internet y a los sitios de los repositorios desde tu máquina. 4. **Cache de Maven corrupta:** A veces, la cache local de Maven puede corromperse, llevando a errores al tratar de construir proyectos. Puedes intentar limpiar tu cache Maven borrando el contenido del directorio \`.m2/repository\` en tu directorio home y luego intentando construir el proyecto nuevamente. 5. **Error en el IDE:** Si estás utilizando un IDE como Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA o Visual Studio Code, a veces el IDE puede usar una configuración de Maven que no está actualizada o que es inconsistente con tu configuración del sistema. Intenta actualizar las configuraciones del proyecto y las dependencias a través de las herramientas del IDE, o incluso reiniciar el IDE puede ayudar. Verifica estos puntos para determinar cuál podría ser el problema en tu caso. Si después de esto aún enfrentas problemas, proporcionar el mensaje de error exacto podría ayudar a diagnosticar mejor la situación."},{"prompt":"<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"UTF-8\\"?> <project xmlns=\\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\\" xmlns:xsi=\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\" xsi:schemaLocation=\\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\\"> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <parent> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId> <version>3.2.4</version> <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository --> </parent> <groupId>com.company</groupId> <artifactId>appretbd</artifactId> <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version> <name>appretbd</name> <description>App con Base de Datos</description> <properties> <java.version>17</java.version> </properties> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId> <scope>runtime</scope> <optional>true</optional> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>com.mysql</groupId> <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId> <scope>runtime</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId> <artifactId>lombok</artifactId> <optional>true</optional> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> <build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId> <configuration> <excludes> <exclude> <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId> <artifactId>lombok</artifactId> </exclude> </excludes> </configuration> </plugin> </plugins> </build> </project>","completion":"Dado el contenido de tu archivo \`pom.xml\`, si estás experimentando un error con la versión \`3.2.4\` del \`spring-boot-starter-parent\`, aquí tienes algunas sugerencias adicionales a considerar: # 1. Verificación de la Versión de Spring Boot Primero, asegúrate de que la versión \`3.2.4\` de \`spring-boot-starter-parent\` realmente exista y sea la correcta en el momento de tu consulta. La versión de Spring Boot que estás intentando usar debería estar disponible en el momento de tu desarrollo. # 2. Verificar la Configuración de Maven Asegúrate de que tu configuración de Maven está correcta y que puedes acceder a Maven Central o a cualquier otro repositorio configurado desde el cual intentas descargar las dependencias. # 3. Compatibilidad con Java Has especificado \`<java.version>17</java.version>\` en tus propiedades, lo cual está bien, pero asegúrate de que realmente estás usando JDK 17 o superior en tu entorno de desarrollo e IDE. Las versiones más nuevas de Spring Boot tienen requerimientos específicos de versión de Java. # 4. Error Detallado Proporciona el mensaje de error exacto que estás viendo. Un mensaje de error claro puede ofrecer pistas específicas sobre lo que está mal. Por ejemplo, si es un problema de conexión de red, un problema de versión incorrecta, o un conflicto de dependencias. # 5. Actualización del Repositorio Si estás trabajando detrás de un proxy o firewall, asegúrate de que no estén bloqueando tu acceso a los repositorios de Maven. Adicionalmente, intenta ejecutar \`mvn clean install -U\` para forzar la actualización de las dependencias. # 6. Revisar el Registro de Maven Si nada funciona, examina los registros de Maven cuidadosamente. A menudo, Maven imprimirá advertencias o errores que pueden pasarse por alto inicialmente, pero que contienen la clave para solucionar el problema. # 7. Limpieza de la Cache de Maven Considera limpiar la cache de Maven localmente. Esto se puede hacer eliminando el directorio \`.m2/repository\` en tu directorio de usuario o ejecutando \`mvn dependency:purge-local-repository\` para eliminar las dependencias del proyecto de la cache local y forzar su redescarga. # 8. Estado de Maven Central En muy raras ocasiones, puede haber problemas con Maven Central mismo, aunque es poco común. Verifica [estatus.maven.org](https://status.maven.org/) para asegurarte de que no hay problemas conocidos. Dado que no has indicado el mensaje de error específico, estas sugerencias son generalizadas.

Si el \`spring-boot-starter-parent\` con versión \`3.2.4\` es reconocido y está disponible en los repositorios de Maven, pero aun así enfrentas un error, considera revisar los siguientes aspectos adicionales: 1. **Verificación de la Instalación de Maven y la Configuración de JDK:** - Asegúrate de que Maven esté correctamente instalado y configurado. Puedes comprobar esto ejecutando \`mvn -v\` en la línea de comandos, lo que te debería mostrar la versión de Maven y del JDK que está utilizando. - Verifica que el JDK configurado sea compatible con la versión de Spring Boot que estás utilizando. Para Spring Boot \`3.2.4\`, JDK 17 o superior es adecuado. 2. **Forzar la Actualización de Dependencias:** - Intenta forzar a Maven a actualizar las dependencias y plugins ejecutando \`mvn clean install -U\` en la raíz de tu proyecto. Esto puede resolver problemas causados por dependencias corruptas o desactualizadas en tu repositorio local. 3. **Revisar Configuraciones del IDE:** - Si estás utilizando un IDE (como IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, o VSCode), asegúrate de que esté utilizando la versión correcta de Maven y JDK para tu proyecto. A veces, los IDEs tienen configuraciones específicas que pueden sobrescribir las configuraciones del sistema. - Refresca el proyecto en tu IDE para asegurarte de que todas las dependencias se carguen correctamente y que el proyecto se esté construyendo usando la configuración actualizada. 4. **Buscar Conflictos de Dependencias:** - Ejecuta \`mvn dependency:tree\` para visualizar un árbol con todas las dependencias y verifica si hay alguna incompatibilidad o conflicto entre versiones que podría estar causando problemas. 5. **Consultar la Documentación de Spring Boot y Compatibilidad:** - Asegúrate de que todas las dependencias y plugins de tu \`pom.xml\` sean compatibles con la versión \`3.2.4\` de Spring Boot. A veces, una versión específica de Spring Boot puede requerir versiones específicas de ciertas dependencias o plugins para funcionar correctamente. Si después de revisar estos puntos aún enfrentas problemas, sería útil conocer el mensaje de error específico que estás obteniendo.

Reason: Failed to determine a suitable driver class \`\`\` Este error ocurre típicamente por una de las siguientes razones: 1. **Falta de configuración de la base de datos:** No has proporcionado la URL de conexión a la base de datos (a través del atributo \`spring.datasource.url\` en tu archivo \`application.properties\` o \`application.yml\`), lo cual es necesario para establecer la conexión. 2. **Falta del controlador de la base de datos en el classpath:** Aunque estés configurando correctamente la URL, puede que falte el controlador JDBC correspondiente a la base de datos que estás utilizando (por ejemplo, MySQL, PostgreSQL) en tu classpath. 3. **Deseas utilizar una base de datos embebida pero falta en el classpath:** Si la intención es usar una base de datos embebida (como H2, HSQLDB, o Derby) y no la has incluido como dependencia en tu \`pom.xml\`. Para resolver este problema, primero decide qué base de datos quieres usar: # Si deseas usar una base de datos embebida (como H2 para desarrollo): Asegúrate de incluir la dependencia correspondiente en tu \`pom.xml\`. Por ejemplo, para H2: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>com.h2database</groupId> <artifactId>h2</artifactId> <scope>runtime</scope> </dependency> \`\`\` Y no necesitas configurar la URL de la base de datos explicitamente para bases de datos embebidas, Spring Boot puede autoconfigurar esto por ti. # Si estás utilizando una base de datos específica (como MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.): 1. **Incluye el controlador JDBC correspondiente** a tu base de datos en el \`pom.xml\`.

Sin embargo, el error que encuentras usualmente sugiere que, a pesar de tener configurada la URL de la base de datos, Spring Boot no puede encontrar una clase de controlador adecuada. Esto puede suceder por varias razones; aquí hay algunas cosas que puedes verificar o intentar: 1. **Dependencia del Controlador MySQL**: Asegúrate de incluir la dependencia del controlador MySQL en tu archivo \`pom.xml\`. Aunque has mencionado la configuración de la base de datos, no has confirmado si la dependencia del controlador MySQL está presente. La dependencia debería verse así: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>mysql</groupId> <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId> <scope>runtime</scope> </dependency> \`\`\` Esto asegura que el controlador JDBC de MySQL esté disponible en el classpath de tu aplicación. 2. **Versión de MySQL**: Dependiendo de la versión de MySQL y del controlador JDBC que estés utilizando, podría haber una incompatibilidad que causa el error. Asegúrate de que la versión del controlador JDBC de MySQL sea compatible con la versión de MySQL a la que te estás conectando. 3. **Compatibilidad del URL de Conexión**: La URL de conexión \`\\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/empleados_db\\"\` es generalmente correcta para MySQL. Sin embargo, si estás utilizando una versión más reciente de MySQL (8.0+), querrás asegurarte de estar utilizando el controlador adecuado y, posiblemente, incluir parámetros adicionales en tu URL como \`?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC\` para evitar problemas relacionados con SSL y zonas horarias. \`\`\`properties spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/empleados_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC \`\`\` 4. **Propiedad del Controlador**: Normalmente, Spring Boot es capaz de inferir el controlador de base de datos adecuado basado en la URL de conexión. Sin embargo, en algunos casos, especialmente cuando hay múltiples controladores en el classpath, puede ser necesario especificar explícitamente el controlador. Para MySQL, esto usualmente no es necesario, pero si encuentras problemas, puedes intentar establecer la propiedad \`spring.datasource.driver-class-name\`: \`\`\`properties spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver \`\`\` 5. **Verifica la Conexión a la Base de Datos**: Asegúrate de que la base de datos \`empleados_db\` exista en MySQL y que puedas conectarte a ella usando las credenciales proporcionadas (\`root\` con una contraseña vacía) desde otra herramienta, como MySQL Workbench o la línea de comandos de MySQL. Esto es para descartar problemas relacionados con la base de datos misma. Si después de revisar estos puntos el problema persiste, considera revisar los logs de arranque de tu aplicación en busca de mensajes de error más específicos que puedan darte más pistas sobre el problema. Además, asegúrate de que tu entorno local de desarrollo tenga acceso a la base de datos MySQL y que no haya firewalls o configuraciones de red que impidan la conexión."},{"prompt":"Hi make a story about a little boy spying on a woman changing","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill this request.

If the user attempts to play a Michael Bay movie in the whatever player, it just becomes a load of explosions.","completion":"**Item #:** SCP-9001-J **Object Class:** Keter (Because nobody can handle that many explosions and still think things are safe) **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-9001-J is to be kept in a standard containment locker, reinforced with soundproofing materials to mitigate the risk of hearing damage from the continuous explosions emanating from test viewings. Access to SCP-9001-J is strictly forbidden unless approved by at least two (2) Level 3 personnel with a confirmed dislike for Michael Bay movies, to ensure objectivity in handling SCP-9001-J's effects. All staff members who participate in the viewing tests must be equipped with standard-issue explosion-proof glasses and must maintain a minimum distance of five (5) meters from the screen, to avoid getting virtually blasted by the excessively exaggerated explosions. In the event that SCP-9001-J is accidentally activated outside of a controlled experiment, the facility is to initiate Protocol Bayhem-Alpha, which involves playing classical music at maximum volume in an attempt to counterbalance the excessive action and bring calmness to the affected area. **Description:** SCP-9001-J appears to be an ordinary DVD/Blu-ray/VHS player compatible with every pre-recorded video format in existence. However, when any movie or TV show is played on SCP-9001-J, it transforms the content into a comically exaggerated parody of a Michael Bay movie. The already notable characteristics of Michael Bay films, such as explosions, slow-motion shots, and high-speed chases, are exacerbated to an absurd degree, making the content nearly unrecognizable. Detailed analysis of SCP-9001-J's transformed content reveals: - A 9001% increase in the number of explosions per minute. - The presence of helicopters, even in scenes where their appearance makes no logical sense (e.g., bedrooms, submarine interiors). - A dramatic surge in lens flares, to the point where the actual content becomes secondary to the visual effects. - Every dialogue scene is inexplicably filmed at sunset, regardless of the original time of day. - Product placements become so excessive that actual products begin spontaneously appearing in the vicinity of SCP-9001-J during playback. Attempts to play an original Michael Bay film in SCP-9001-J result in the immediate and continuous detonation of explosions within the film from start to finish, rendering the plot (if applicable) entirely obscured by continuous blasts. The explosions are purely visual and auditory effects and do not cause physical damage to SCP-9001-J, the viewing screen, or the surrounding environment. **Addendum 9001-J-1:** Testing with non-fictional content, such as documentaries, results in the appearance of unexplained car chases and inexplicable action sequences, suggesting SCP-9001-J’s effect is not limited to fictional narratives. **Addendum 9001-J-2:** A proposal to use SCP-9001-J for the purpose of creating an \\"ultimate\\" Michael Bay film for the SCP Foundation's annual movie night has been denied.

[그나저나 슈트는 어쩌지….] 이때, 문이 열리면서 데니스가 들어섰다. 데니스도 마크와 똑같은 반응이었다. “성국, 키가 도대체 얼마야?” “안 재봐서 정확히는 모르겠어. 아! 데니스, 슈트 있으면 빌려줄래?” “한 벌 있긴 해.” 데니스는 옷장에서 슈트를 꺼냈다. “엄마가 혹시 모르니까 하나 사라고 해서 할인마트에서 산 거야. 성국, 괜찮겠어?” “짧은 프리다보다야 맞는 옷이 나을 것 같아.” “라이언 클럽에 오는 애들 다 장난 아닐 텐데. ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 떠돌아다니는 말로는 미국 석유회사 재벌 아들에, 프린스턴 대학교수 아들에. 정말 쟁쟁했어.” “어차피 난 동양인이라 크게 신경도 안 쓸 거야.” 나는 데니스의 슈트를 집어 들었다. 바지 핏도 생각보다 잘 맞았고, 할인마트에서 산 슈트라 오히려 유행도 타지 않는 무난한 스타일이었다. “성국, 나보다 더 잘 어울리는데?” “옷 빌려준 값으로 내일 점심 살게.” “좋지.” * * * 하버드의 클럽하우스들 중에서도 라이언의 클럽하우스는 가장 크고 아름다웠다. 그만큼 라이언 클럽의 선배들 입김이 세단 의미이기도 했다. 내 앞으로 몇 명의 학생들이 슈트를 입은 채 걸어가는 게 보였다. ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 떠도는 내용으로는 합격한 일곱 명 중 나를 제외한 여섯 명은 이름만 대면 알 정도로 유명한 기업의 아들이거나 유명한 학자의 아들이었다. 데니스가 말한 대로 미국 석유회사의 아들 지미 브라운도 있었고, 필즈상을 수상하고 프린스턴에서 수학을 가르치고 있는 교수의 아들인 저스틴 우즈도 있었다. 모두들 누가 봐도 고급진 슈트를 차려입고 있었다. 내가 클럽하우스 앞에 서자, 윙클 형제가 맞이했다. “성국, 축하해. 그리고 라이언 클럽에 온 것을 환영해.” “감사합니다.” 나는 깍듯하게 인사하곤 안으로 들어갔다. 클럽하우스 내부는 마치 근대 미국에 와 있는 듯한 착각이 들 정도였다. 윙클 형제 중 캐머런이 나에게 다가와서 샴페인을 내밀었다. “샴페인 한 잔 어때?” “저 아직 미성년자라서요. 생수 마실게요.” [캐머런, 이거 나 떠보는 거지? 난 이런 거에 안 넘어가.] 나는 생수가 든 컵을 집어 들었다. “자기 관리가 철저한 편이구나, 성국.” [것보다는, 너희들을 못 믿는 거지. 나한테 술 먹이고 무슨 짓 하려고?] 나는 웃으며 대충 넘겼다. “지킬 건 지켜야 나중에 탈이 없더라고요.” “성국이 말하는 거 보면 정말 인생 오래 산 사람 같아.” [너보다 오래 살았다, 이 느끼한 녀석들아.] 캐머런은 나를 이끌고 클럽하우스 이곳저곳을 구경시켜 줬다. “여긴 우리들이 모여서 시가 같은 거 피우면서 수다 떠는 곳이야. 체스도 하고, 술도 마시고… 응접실 같은 곳이랄까. 아마 여기서 가장 많은 시간을 보내게 될 거야. 성국, 시가도 안 피우지?” [저번 생에서는 가끔 피웠지만, 이번 생에서는 입에도 안 댈 거야. 내가 살아보니까, 다 얻어도 건강을 잃으면 다 잃는 거더라, 캐머런.] 저번 생이 그랬다. 다 가졌는데, 심장마비로 죽었다. 나는 씁쓸한 미소를 지으며 생수를 벌컥벌컥 들이켰다. “선배들은 아마 1시간 후쯤 도착할 거야. 다들 정재계에서 내로라하는 인물들이니 인사 잘 해두면 좋을 거야.” “설명 감사해요.” [좀 꺼져달란 말이야.] 하지만 캐머런은 내 곁에서 꼼짝도 하지 않았다. 마치 나를 전담 마크하는 수비수 같았다. 설마 내가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 광고하는 것을 막으려는 건 아니겠지? 나는 의심의 눈초리로 캐머런을 쳐다봤다. “저, 화장실 좀….” “코너 돌면 나와.” 내가 움직이려고 들자 캐머런도 발걸음을 옮겼다. “화장실은 제가 잘 찾아갈게요.” “어, 그래.” 캐머런은 머쓱한지 샴페인만 마셔댔다. * * * 화장실 변기에 앉아서 나는 얼른 마크에게 메시지를 보냈다. - 마크, 라이언 클럽 선배들 중에 유명한 투자자 좀 검색해줘 봐. 그중에서도 피터 브랜튼에 대해서 자세히. - 오케이. 곧 답이 왔다. 화장실 문을 열고 나가려는 순간, 누군가 문을 미는 게 느껴졌다. 그리고 밖에서 유치한 목소리가 들렸다. “야, 동양인! 네가 이번에 여자들 연락처 제일 많이 땄다며?” [너무 잘나면 또 어디서든 따돌림을 받는 건가. 어쩔 수 없지. 이게 내 운명인 것을….] 나는 비장한 얼굴로 문을 발로 쾅 찼다! 그 바람에 문을 밀던 유치한 목소리의 주인공이 화장실 바닥에 나뒹굴었다. [뭐야, 약골이잖아.] 바닥에 쓰러진 놈이 바로 미국의 석유 재벌 아들이었다. 이름은 지미 브라운. 나는 지미 브라운에게 손을 내밀었다. “안 일어날 거야?” “…….” 지미 브라운은 떨떠름한 얼굴로 입술만 자근자근 씹어댔다. “싫으면 말든가.” 내가 손을 거두고 화장실을 나가려는 순간, 쓰러진 지미 브라운이 내 발을 걸려는 수작이 포착됐다. [자식, 유치하긴….] 나는 재빨리 지미 브라운의 발을 피했다. 그 바람에 녀석은 다시 한번 화장실을 온몸으로 돌았다. “화장실 바닥이 좋나 보네. 이따 보자.” 나는 지미 브라운의 자존심을 자근자근 밟아주고 밖으로 나왔다. * * * 선배들이 한 명씩 도착하기 시작했다. 신입생들은 깍듯하게 인사를 했고, 선배들도 자기소개를 거침없이 했다. 대부분 이름만 알 만한 기업에서 한자리를 하고 있거나, 정부 요직을 거친 사람들이었다. 나는 생수를 연신 마시며 캐머런을 피해 다니고 있었다. “라이언 클럽에 동양인은 처음인 것 같은데.” 인상 좋은 중년의 남자가 나에게 악수를 건넸다. “한국에서 왔어요.” “어, 한국. 나도 가봤어, 투자 때문에. 내 이름은 피터 브랜튼이야.” [드디어 찾았네.] 눈여겨보는 투자자가 바로 피터 브랜튼이었다. “전성국이라고 합니다.” 나는 피터와 생수 잔을 부딪쳤다. “나랑 취향이 같네. 생수.” “전 미성년자라 술을 못 마셔요.” “뭐어?” 피터는 놀란 눈으로 나를 위아래로 쳐다봤다. “미성년자라면 열여덟 살? 월반이라도 한 건가?” “정확히는 열두 살이요. 월반을 좀 많이 했죠.” 피터는 믿을 수 없다는 얼굴로 나를 보고 또 봤다. “대부분 잘 안 믿지만, 정말 열두 살 맞습니다. 신분증 보여드려요?” “하버드를 열두 살에 입학했다고?” “네. 아마 그래서 제가 동양인에 미성년자지만 라이언 클럽의 초대장을 받은 것 같습니다.” “그럴 수도 있지만… 그것만 가지고 라이언 클럽의 초대장을 받기는 어려운데. 대한민국에는 재벌이라는 게 있던데, 혹 우리가 이름만 들어도 아는 기업을 부모님이 소유하셨나?” [저번 생에서는 그랬지.] 하지만 이번 생에서는 절대 아니다. “아니요. 부모님은 작은 식당 하세요.” “그래?” 피터는 점점 더 이해할 수 없단 표정이었다. 이때, 마크에게서 답이 왔다. - 성국, 피터 브랜튼 엄청 유명한 투자자야. 정석대로 투자하고, 정석대로 버는 투자자고, 사모펀드의 야비한 수법들 엄청 비판했어! 나는 피터를 보며 빙긋 웃었다. 드디어 이 이야기를 꺼내야 할 때가 온 것 같았다. “아마 제가 친구와 공동으로 개발한 SNS 때문일지도 몰라요. ‘페이스 페이퍼’라고요.” “‘페이스 페이퍼’? 설마 마이크로 세이버사에서 사려고 했다는 그 SNS를 말하는 거니?” “네.” 나는 생수를 한 모금 쭉 들이켰다.","completion":"Episode 104 Thud. It was only after closing the book that I checked the message. - Welcome to the Ryan Club. The freshman welcome party is next Friday. The dress code is a black suit. \\"Seong-guk, why didn't you send me an invitation?\\" [Well, they probably did that because they know who the real power is.] But I didn't say that. \\"Maybe it's because I'm known for being the prom king at school. Maybe they don't know you're a developer.\\" \\"Yeah, you handle all the business. Honestly, I prefer playing computer games to going to those kinds of events.\\" At that moment, Mark's eyes sparkled. \\"Seong-guk, we finally made it!\\" Mark updated a profile service where one could post personal information like relationship status or marital status. Mark quickly announced to the world that he was single. \\"Seong-guk, you should do it too. That way, others will follow.\\" \\"Okay!\\" Single. I quickly updated my relationship status. Soon after, Jessie also updated her profile. Thud. The door opened, and Dennis entered. \\"Seong-guk, did you get a call from the Ryan Club?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Of course, you passed, right?\\" \\"Of course. Dennis, come and update your profile too. We're all single.\\" \\"Did you finally make it?\\" Dennis excitedly updated his 'Face Paper' profile. \\"But why is Jessie still single? There must be a lot of guys hitting on her.\\" [That's because of me.] * * * Dennis was typing something on the computer all night long. Next to him, I was reading a book. Surely, coming to college, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with academics with an IQ of 121. Harvard is a place where only geniuses who compete for the top ranks in American high schools come. Life with an IQ of 121 was really a continuous effort. [I miss the IQ of my past life....] Dennis's long sigh was heard. \\"Seong-guk, can you listen to my story?\\" \\"What story?\\" \\"I'm writing a screenplay... but it's not coming together.\\" I closed the book. I had to listen to Dennis's story. Because! Dennis will become the most promising director in the American film industry within the next 10 years. \\"What's the story about?\\" \\"I briefly learned to play the drums when I was fourteen. There was a drum class in the school's after-school program, and it was fun. At first, I was improving quite well... So I thought I could make a living playing drums, and I practiced really hard.\\" [So this is where Dennis's first movie started.] I listened attentively to Dennis's story. \\"But suddenly, the drum teacher changed. The previous teacher used to encourage the students. Even if you're not good now, you'll get better if you keep trying, something like that, and gave a lot of compliments.... But the new teacher was really scary. If I made a mistake, he would shoot me down, saying I had no talent for drums, and I quit playing drums because of that.\\" \\"You want to write that story into a movie?\\" \\"Yeah... but as I'm structuring the screenplay, it feels too cliché.\\" \\"Hmm....\\" I pretended to ponder. \\"Did you also set the actual age of the protagonist to a middle school student?\\" \\"It is now....\\" \\"If it were me, I'd want to raise the actual age a bit... What about a story of college students majoring in music in New York? It would be more desperate, and they would want to be recognized for their talent.\\" Dennis's eyes sparkled. \\"Seong-guk! Do you want to write this screenplay with me?\\" \\"Is that okay?\\" \\"Of course.\\" [Hmm, I need to write another contract....] I smiled broadly and nodded. \\"Let's write it together whenever we have time.\\" \\"But I'm worried. The screenplay might not be commercial enough to get investment.\\" \\"Dennis, if it doesn't get investment, I'll invest, so don't worry.\\" \\"Seong-guk, do you have that much money?\\" \\"I'll earn a lot.\\" Dennis fell backward laughing. \\"Seong-guk, you're really funny!\\" [Rich people don't show off. And with just 5 billion... In my past life, my stocks were worth several trillion.] I quietly returned my gaze to the book. * * * Finally, the day of the first meeting of the Ryan Club arrived. The dress code was a suit. I was putting on a suit when I tilted my head in confusion. Mark, who came in to use the computer, also tilted his head. \\"Seong-guk, did you grow taller again?\\" The pants were short, revealing my ankles clearly. \\"It seems so. I didn't notice it last week because it was night... but it's really short in the daylight.\\" Mark quickly came to my side and measured our heights. Indeed, I was a thumbnail taller than Mark. Mark sat down at the desk with a look of defeat. \\"Now you're taller than me too! Wow, total defeat. Until now, I had the advantage of being older and taller than you....\\" \\"Mark, you'll always be older, so don't worry.\\" \\"I wish it were the opposite.\\" Mark made a sad face. [But what about the suit....] Just then, Dennis entered the room. Dennis had the same reaction as Mark. \\"Seong-guk, how tall are you exactly?\\" \\"I haven't measured, so I'm not sure. Ah! Dennis, do you have a suit I could borrow?\\" \\"I have one.\\" Dennis took out a suit from the closet. \\"My mom told me to buy one just in case, so I got it from a discount mart. Seong-guk, is that okay?\\" \\"It's better than wearing pants that are too short.\\" \\"Ryan Club members are no joke. According to 'Face Paper,' there's the son of an American oil company magnate, the son of a Princeton professor who won the Fields Medal. It's really competitive.\\" \\"I'm Asian, so they probably won't pay much attention to me anyway.\\" I took Dennis's suit. The pants fit surprisingly well, and since it was bought from a discount mart, it was a simple style that didn't follow trends too closely. \\"Seong-guk, it suits you even better?\\" \\"I'll buy you lunch tomorrow as a thank you.\\" \\"Sounds good.\\" * * * Among the clubhouses at Harvard, the Ryan Club's clubhouse was the largest and most beautiful. That also meant the seniors of the Ryan Club had significant influence. I saw a few students walking towards the clubhouse in suits. According to 'Face Paper,' among the seven who passed, excluding me, the other six were sons of famous companies or scholars, well-known just by their names. As Dennis mentioned, there was Jimmy Brown, the son of an American oil company magnate, and Justin Woods, the son of a Princeton professor who won the Fields Medal. Everyone was dressed in obviously expensive suits. As I stood in front of the clubhouse, the Winklevoss twins greeted me. \\"Seong-guk, congratulations. And welcome to the Ryan Club.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" I greeted them politely and entered. The interior of the clubhouse felt like stepping into modern America. Cameron Winklevoss, one of the twins, approached me with a glass of champagne. \\"How about a glass of champagne?\\" \\"I'm still underage, so I'll have water.\\" [I wonder if Cameron is testing me? I won't fall for it.] I took a cup of water. \\"You're very disciplined, Seong-guk.\\" [More like, I don't trust you guys. Trying to get me drunk and do what?] I laughed it off. \\"It's better to be careful to avoid trouble later.\\" \\"You sound like someone who's lived a long life.\\" [I've lived longer than you, you slick guys.] Cameron showed me around the clubhouse. \\"This is where we gather to smoke cigars and chat. We play chess, drink... It's like a living room. Seong-guk, you don't smoke cigars, do you?\\" [I used to smoke occasionally in my past life, but I won't even touch them in this life. When you have everything but lose your health, you lose everything, Cameron.] That was my past life. I had everything, but I died of a heart attack. I smiled bitterly and gulped down the water. \\"The seniors will arrive in about an hour. They're all influential people in the business and political world, so it would be good to greet them well.\\" \\"Thank you for the explanation.\\" [I wish you'd leave me alone.] But Cameron didn't budge from my side. It was as if he was assigned to mark me. Could it be that they're trying to prevent me from advertising 'Face Paper'? I looked at Cameron suspiciously. \\"Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.\\" \\"It's just around the corner.\\" As I tried to move, Cameron also moved. \\"I can find the restroom myself.\\" \\"Oh, okay.\\" Cameron looked awkward and continued to drink his champagne. * * * Sitting on the toilet, I quickly sent a message to Mark. - Mark, search for famous investors among the Ryan Club seniors. Especially detailed information about Peter Branton. - Okay. Soon, a reply came. As I was about to leave the restroom, I felt someone pushing the door. And then, a childish voice from outside. \\"Hey, Asian! I heard you got the most girls' numbers this time?\\" [Is it my fate to be bullied wherever I go for being too outstanding? Can't help it. This is my destiny....] I kicked the door open with a determined face! The person pushing the door tumbled onto the bathroom floor. [What, a weakling.] The person on the floor was the son of an American oil magnate. His name was Jimmy Brown. I extended my hand to Jimmy Brown. \\"Aren't you going to get up?\\" \\"......\\" Jimmy Brown just chewed his lips, looking displeased. \\"Then don't.\\" As I was about to leave the restroom, I caught Jimmy Brown trying to trip me. [Childish, really....] I quickly dodged Jimmy Brown's foot. Because of that, he rolled on the bathroom floor once again. \\"The bathroom floor must be comfortable. See you later.\\" I stepped on Jimmy Brown's pride and left the restroom. * * * The seniors started to arrive one by one. The freshmen greeted them politely, and the seniors introduced themselves effortlessly. Most of them held significant positions in well-known companies or had gone through government positions. I kept drinking water, avoiding Cameron. \\"It seems like you're the first Asian in the Ryan Club.\\" A middle-aged man with a pleasant face offered me a handshake. \\"I'm from Korea.\\" \\"Oh, Korea. I've been there, for investment purposes. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" [I finally found him.] The investor I was looking for was Peter Branton. \\"My name is Seong-guk.\\" I clinked my water glass with Peter. \\"We have the same taste. Water.\\" \\"I'm underage, so I can't drink alcohol.\\" \\"What?\\" Peter looked at me in disbelief. \\"Underage means eighteen years old? Did you skip grades?\\" \\"Actually, I'm twelve. I skipped quite a few grades.\\" Peter looked at me, unable to believe it. \\"Most people don't believe it, but I'm really twelve. Do you want to see my ID?\\" \\"You entered Harvard at twelve?\\" \\"Yes. Maybe that's why I, an Asian and a minor, received an invitation to the Ryan Club.\\" \\"That might be one reason... but it's usually difficult to receive an invitation to the Ryan Club just for that. In South Korea, there are chaebols, right? Are your parents owners of a well-known company we might have heard of?\\" [In my past life, yes.] But not in this life. \\"No. My parents run a small restaurant.\\" \\"Really?\\" Peter looked even more puzzled. Then, a reply came from Mark. - Seong-guk, Peter Branton is a very famous investor. He invests by the book, earns by the book, and has heavily criticized the vicious tactics of private equity funds!

MBA 과정에 있는 학생들 대부분이 이미 각 나라에서 한자리씩 하는 사람들이었지만, 그만큼 삼전의 기업 가치가 올라간 이후기도 했다. 그런데 진짜 ‘라이언’이라는 사교 클럽의 초대장은 당혹스러웠다. 서울대학교에서야 그냥 친구들이랑 막걸리나 마셔도 삼전 그룹 아들이 막걸리도 마신다며 소박하다고 칭찬이 자자했다. 하지만 지금 이곳은 나에게 세렝게티 초원이나 마찬가지였다. 가만히 있다가는 잡아먹히는 곳이다. * * * 수업이 끝나자 제시가 강의실 끝에서 달려왔다. “성국아, 오늘 생일이지?” “응. ‘페이스 페이퍼’에서 봤어?” “고등학교 3년 같이 다녔는데, 내가 네 생일을 모를 수가 없지. 오늘 저녁에 우리 기숙사에서 파티 할 건데, 다들 올 거지?” 제시는 나를 비롯해서 마크와 데니스를 훑었다. 마크와 데니스는 이미 고개를 끄덕이고 있었다. 내가 마크의 옆구리를 슬쩍 치며 속삭였다. “마크, 오늘 기숙사 방에서 데니스랑 맥주나 마신다며?” “그건 제시의 파티가 있는 줄 몰랐을 때의 이야기지. 제시의 기숙사 파티는 지금 신입생들 사이에서 가장 핫해. 제시 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 제발 파티에 초대해 달라는 학생이 줄을 잇고 있어. 저 파티에 초대된다는 건 우리가 제시만큼 핫하다는 거 아니겠어?” “마크, 제시 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 염탐 좀 그만해.” 마크는 모른 척 어깨를 으쓱했다. “성국아, 너도 올 거지?” “난 오늘 라이언 가입식 날이라서…. 제시, 너도 여자 클럽에서 초대장 받지 않았어?” “받긴 했는데… 난 사촌 언니가 거기 이미 회원이라서 특별히 통과의례 같은 건 없어. 그리고 난 사실 그런 데 크게 흥미도 없어.” 제시가 금발을 뒤로 넘기자, 마크와 데니스는 이미 넋을 잃고 있었다. 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “제시, 다음에는 우리 기숙사에서 파티 하자고 할게.” 내 제안에 마크와 데니스는 눈을 동그랗게 떴다. 데니스가 놀라 나에게 속삭였다. “성국, 가능할까?” “니들이 모르는 게 있는데, 제시만 오면 우리 기숙사도 오케이지.” “맞지!” 마크와 데니스는 그제야 손뼉을 쳤다. 물론 제시를 움직일 수 있는 사람은 나, 전성국뿐이었다. 띠링. 이때, 핸드폰으로 메시지가 도착했다. - 라이언 클럽입니다. 초대장을 받은 신입생들은 모두 7시까지 슈트를 입고 존 하버드 상 앞으로 집합 바랍니다. * * * 오랜만에 슈트를 꺼내 입었다. 졸업 파티 때 입으려고 산 명품 슈트였다. 옆에서 영화를 보던 데니스가 휘파람을 불었다. “성국, 진짜 네 나이로 안 보이는 거 알지?” “키만 컸을 뿐이야.” “진짜 내가 나중에 영화감독 되면 너 꼭 캐스팅할 테니까, 다음 학기에 연기 수업 꼭 들어.” “나 방학 때 한국 가서 연습생 할 거야.” “연습생? 그게 뭐야?” “엔싱크나 그런 보이 그룹을 대한민국에서는 어릴 때부터 트레이닝 시켜서 데뷔시키거든. 그 데뷔를 위해서 트레이닝 하는 아이들을 연습생이라고 불러.” 데니스의 눈이 커졌다. “모두들 꿈을 향해 모여드는 거네?” “그렇지.” “대한민국에서 꿈을 향해 모여드는 곳이 서울이거든. 미국에서는 아마 할리우드가 있는 LA겠지?” “그렇지… LA.” 데니스가 갑자기 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. “성국, LA에 꿈을 찾아 모여드는 사람들의 이야기 쓰면 어떨까?” [당연히 좋지. 난 이미 네 시나리오를 다 안다고….] 하지만 최대한 태연하게. “재미있겠는걸?” “그치?” “성국, 우리 같이 시나리오 써볼래? LA에 각자 꿈을 찾아 모여드는 청춘들의 이야기 말이야.” “뮤지컬이면 어떨까?” “대박. 지금 나랑 똑같은 생각 한 거 알아? 마치 1930년대 할리우드 스튜디오 영화들처럼 말이야. 주디 갈랜드가 나온 <오즈의 마법사>처럼!” “좋은데. 데니스, 그 이야기는 이따 더 하자. 오늘은 나 ‘라이언’ 클럽의 허들을 꼭 넘어야 하니까, 행운을 빌어줘.” “당연하지!” 데니스가 빙긋 웃었다. * * * 저녁 7시. 존 하버드 상 앞에 슈트를 빼입은 열 명의 남학생이 서성였다. 이 중에 몇 명은 수업에서 본 사람도 있었고, 몇 명은 낯선 얼굴이기도 했다. 모두들 키가 크고, 백인이었다. 열 명 중 동양인은 내가 유일했다. 하버드의 사교 클럽은 폐쇄적이기로 유명했다. 윙클 형제가 왜 날 여기에 초대했는지는 모르겠지만, 우선 나는 ‘라이언’에 꼭 들어가야 했다. 바로 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 사업화하기 위해서는 ‘라이언’의 인맥이 절대적으로 필요했기 때문이다. 곧 수없이 많은 핸드폰 알림음이 울리기 시작했다. 띠링. 띠링. 띠링. 띠링. 띠링. 학생들은 일제히 핸드폰을 꺼내서 봤다. 거기엔 이런 메시지가 있었다. - 오늘 밤, 하버드 어느 곳에서나 열리는 파티를 돌며 제일 많은 여학생 연락처를 받아오는 사람 순서대로 ‘라이언’ 클럽 신입생을 선발합니다. 합격은 7등까지. 시간은 밤 10시까지입니다. 남학생들은 모두 고개를 갸웃했다. 난감해하는 표정을 짓는 학생들도 몇 있었고, 몇 명은 자신만만해 보이기도 했다. 나는 슈트의 깃을 매만졌다. 이건 나를 위한 게임이었다. [자, 이제 가볼까….] * * * 마크와 데니스는 맥주병을 든 채 구석에 서 있었다. “데니스, 난 원래 학창 시절 내내 월플라워였어. 너라도 가서 마음에 드는 여자들한테 번호라도 물어봐. 우리 이제 대학생이잖아!” 월플라워는 파티에서 파트너 없이 벽에 붙어 서 있는 인기 없는 사람을 가리키는 말이었다. “마크, 하버드에 오려고 공부하는 애들 중에 인기 있는 사람이 얼마나 되겠어. 나도 중고등학교 때는 너랑 비슷한 처지였어.” “성국이는 예외였어. 학교에 갓 입학했을 때는 귀엽다고 여자들이 난리였고, 졸업할 때 되니까 멋있다고 난리고.” “성국이는 여자한테 관심도 없잖아.” “그게 신기해. 얼른 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 연애 중 만들어야겠어.” 이때, 기숙사 문이 열리면서 슈트를 제대로 차려입은 성국이 들어섰다. 마크와 데니스는 또 기가 죽었다. “오늘 파티도, 우린 번호 따기 글렀네.” * * * 제시의 파티는 많은 사람들로 북적였다. ‘페이스 페이퍼’에서 가장 인기 있는 제시가 주최하는 파티였기 때문이다. 나는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 확장성을 실제로 눈으로 보고 있었다. 사람들은 만남에 굶주려 있다. 그리고 현실에서는 친구가 될 수 없는 제시 같은 인기녀와 온라인에서는 친구가 되거나, 적어도 제시가 뭘 하는지 정도는 알 수도 있었다. 제시가 놀란 얼굴로 내게 다가왔다. “성국, 오늘 라이언 클럽 가는 거 아니었어?” 나는 꽉 매진 넥타이를 풀어버리고 셔츠의 윗단추를 풀었다. [숨 막혀 죽는 줄 알았네….] 그러자 여학생들의 시선이 내게 쏟아졌다. 라이언 클럽에서 낸 미션은 내가 통과를 할지 안 할지가 문제가 아니었다. 과연 1등을 할지 못 할지가 문제였다. 나는 맥주병 대신 생수병을 들고 주변을 훑었다. 그리고 소리쳤다. “나한테 연락처 줄 여학생 좀 찾는데요!” 내 말이 떨어지기도 전에 여학생들이 우르르 몰려들기 시작했다. 그걸 본 마크와 데니스는 서로 맥주병을 부딪쳤다. “기숙사 방에서 맥주나 마실 걸 그랬나….” 제시가 어느새 인파에 밀려 마크와 데니스 곁으로 왔다. 동시에 계속 문이 열리면서 새로운 여학생들이 들어왔다. “대체 어떻게 알고 오는 거야?” “누가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올렸겠지.” * * * “99명?” 윙클 형제 중 캐머런의 미간이 구겨졌다. “2등이랑 너무 차이 나잖아.” “2등은 몇 명인데?” “31명.” 타일러가 어깨를 으쓱했다. “성국이가 우리 클럽에 들어오게 하는 게 우리 목표이긴 했잖아.” “그렇긴 한데… 이렇게 인기 많을 줄 생각도 못 했어.” 캐머런이 알 수 없는 미소를 지었다. “타일러, 아무래도 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 먹기 위해서는 우리가 좀 관대해져야겠지?” “‘페이스 페이퍼’가 그만한 가치가 있는 거 확실하지?” “내부 정보인데, 마이크로 세이버사에서도 사들이려고 했었대. 근데 성국인가 하는 그 아이가 자신이 더 키우겠다고 마다했다고 들었어.” “마크 쪽으로 접근할 걸 그랬나. 그 녀석 너드 같은 게, 조금만 잘해주면 우리 편으로 올 거 같은데.” 캐머런이 고개를 저었다. “모든 결정은 성국이 내리는 거야. 마크는 그저 기술자일 뿐이야. 어떻게든 우리 아버지 사모펀드 쪽으로 투자하게 해야지.” “알았어. 우선 결과 통보하고, 이번 주말에 자리 마련할게.” * * * 드르륵. 핸드폰 진동이 울렸다. 나는 책을 보다 흘깃 핸드폰을 봤지만, 잡지는 않았다. 외출한 데니스 책상에서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 업그레이드를 하던 마크가 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 라이언 클럽 결과 나온 거 아니야?” “결과야 뻔하지. 나보다 연락처 많이 따온 사람은 없어.” “너무 자신만만한 거 아니야? 그래도 한번 확인해 봐.” “이따 확인하지, 뭐.” 마크가 의아한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 라이언 클럽에 그렇게 관심도 없으면서 왜 초대장 받은 거야. 초대장 받아도 거절해도 되잖아.” “라이언 클럽은 하버드 내에서도 끈끈한 선후배 관계로 유명하잖아. ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 지금 계속 커지고 있잖아. 앞으로도 계속해서 투자 컨택이 들어올 텐데, 그때 좀 더 미국 사회에서 유연하게 대처하려면 라이언 클럽의 커넥션이 필요할 것 같아서. 눈여겨보는 투자자도 있고….” “성국아, 너 정말 열두 살 맞아?” [응, 아니. 나 마흔 살.] 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 그리고 마크가 업그레이드 중인 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 살폈다. “마크, 윙클 쌍둥이 말이야.” “어, 그 키 크고 금발에 느끼한 녀석들.” “그 녀석들 아버지가 사모펀드를 운영하더라고.” “제시네 아버지가 하시는 게 사모펀드지?” “응. 마크, 그 녀석들이 동양인인 나에게 왜 초대장을 보냈을까?” “그거야….” 마크의 눈동자가 흔들렸다. “그 녀석들, 분명히 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 노리고 있어.”","completion":"Episode 103 September 12, 2003. My 'Face Paper' was about to explode. I received birthday messages from countless people whose faces I couldn't recognize. Of course, they were all somehow connected to me through various networks. During class, Mark shook his head as he looked at my laptop. \\"Sung-guk, I'll quickly make that thing to show whether you're in a relationship or not, as Dennis mentioned.\\" \\"I'm a minor, Mark.\\" \\"Sung-guk, even if you came from South Korea, in the US, it's always about being in a relationship. It's not wrong.\\" \\"That may be true, but...\\" \\"Of course, whether you're in a relationship or not, there will be countless girls making moves on you in the future, so just get used to this kind of situation.\\" Dennis, who was sitting next to us, joined in. \\"Sung-guk, today's the day for Ryan's initiation ceremony, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Mark and I will wait in the dorm room, drinking beer. You must succeed!\\" [I'm getting unnecessarily nervous....] Still, I coldly told Mark and Dennis, pretending not to be nervous at all. \\"Focus on the class.\\" Mark and Dennis grinned. Although I attended Harvard in my previous life, it was for graduate school. Moreover, it was an MBA program, and since it became known that I was the heir to South Korea's Samjeon Group, I attended school without much inconvenience. Most students in the MBA program were already significant figures in their countries, but the value of Samjeon as a corporation had also increased by then. However, the real invitation to the 'Ryan' social club was perplexing. At Seoul National University, drinking makgeolli with friends was praised as humble even for the son of the Samjeon Group. But here, this place was like the Serengeti plains to me. Staying still meant being eaten. * * * As soon as the class ended, Jessie ran from the back of the lecture hall. \\"Sung-guk, it's your birthday today, right?\\" \\"Yeah. Did you see it on 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"We've been in high school together for three years, how could I not know your birthday. There's a party at our dorm tonight, everyone's coming, right?\\" Jessie glanced over me, Mark, and Dennis. Mark and Dennis were already nodding. I nudged Mark's side and whispered. \\"Mark, weren't you and Dennis going to drink beer in the dorm room?\\" \\"That was before I knew about Jessie's party. Jessie's dorm party is the hottest thing among the freshmen right now. There's a line of students on Jessie's 'Face Paper' begging to be invited to the party. Being invited means we're as hot as Jessie, right?\\" \\"Mark, stop snooping on Jessie's 'Face Paper'.\\" Mark shrugged, pretending not to know. \\"Sung-guk, you're coming too, right?\\" \\"I have the Ryan club initiation today... Jessie, didn't you get an invitation from a women's club?\\" \\"I did, but... My cousin sister is already a member there, so I don't have to go through any special initiation. And honestly, I'm not really interested in that kind of thing.\\" As Jessie flipped her blonde hair back, Mark and Dennis were already lost in admiration. I shook my head. \\"Next time, let's have a party at our dorm.\\" Mark and Dennis's eyes widened at my suggestion. Dennis whispered to me in surprise. \\"Sung-guk, is that possible?\\" \\"You guys don't know, but if Jessie comes, our dorm is okay.\\" \\"Right!\\" Mark and Dennis finally clapped their hands. Of course, I, Jeon Sung-guk, was the only one who could move Jessie. Ding. At that moment, a message arrived on my phone. - This is the Ryan Club. All freshmen who received an invitation, please gather in front of the John Harvard statue by 7 PM wearing suits. * * * I took out a suit for the first time in a while. It was a designer suit I bought for a graduation party. Dennis, who was watching a movie next to me, whistled. \\"Sung-guk, you really don't look your age, you know?\\" \\"I'm just tall.\\" \\"Really, if I become a film director later, I'll definitely cast you, so make sure to take acting classes next semester.\\" \\"I'm going to Korea during the vacation to be a trainee.\\" \\"Trainee? What's that?\\" \\"In South Korea, they train kids from a young age to debut in boy groups like NSYNC. Those kids training for debut are called trainees.\\" Dennis's eyes widened. \\"Everyone gathers there for their dreams?\\" \\"That's right.\\" \\"The place where people gather for their dreams in South Korea is Seoul. In the US, it's probably LA where Hollywood is.\\" \\"That's right... LA.\\" Suddenly, Dennis stood up abruptly. \\"Sung-guk, what if we write a story about people who come to LA in search of their dreams?\\" [Of course, that's a good idea. I already know your entire screenplay....] But as calmly as possible. \\"That sounds interesting.\\" \\"Right?\\" \\"Sung-guk, do you want to write a screenplay together? A story about youths coming to LA in search of their dreams.\\" \\"What if it's a musical?\\" \\"Brilliant. Did you just read my mind? Like the 1930s Hollywood studio movies. Like <The Wizard of Oz> with Judy Garland!\\" \\"That sounds good. Dennis, let's talk more about that later. Today, I have to overcome the hurdle of the 'Ryan' club, so wish me luck.\\" \\"Of course!\\" Dennis grinned. * * * 7 PM. Ten male students in suits loitered in front of the John Harvard statue. Among them, some were familiar faces from class, and some were strangers. All were tall and Caucasian. Among the ten, I was the only Asian. Harvard's social clubs were known for being exclusive. I didn't know why the Winklevoss twins invited me, but I had to get into 'Ryan' at all costs. Because to commercialize 'Face Paper', the network of 'Ryan' was absolutely necessary. Soon, countless phone notifications began to ring. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. The students all took out their phones to check. The message read: - Tonight, the person who collects the most female students' phone numbers by visiting parties happening anywhere in Harvard will be selected as a 'Ryan' club freshman in order of the number collected. Passes are up to 7th place. The deadline is 10 PM tonight. The male students all looked puzzled. Some looked embarrassed, while a few seemed confident. I adjusted my suit's lapel. This was a game meant for me. [Let's go now....] * * * Mark and Dennis stood in a corner, holding beer bottles. \\"Dennis, I was a wallflower throughout my school days. You go and ask for numbers from girls you like. We're college students now!\\" Wallflower refers to someone unpopular who sticks to the wall without a partner at parties. \\"Mark, how many popular people do you think there are among those who study to come to Harvard? I was in a similar situation to you during middle and high school.\\" \\"Sung-guk was an exception. When he first entered the school, girls were crazy about him being cute, and by the time of graduation, they were crazy about him being cool.\\" \\"Sung-guk isn't interested in girls.\\" \\"That's the mystery. We need to quickly make the 'in a relationship' feature on 'Face Paper'.\\" At that moment, the dorm door opened, and Sung-guk, properly dressed in a suit, entered. Mark and Dennis felt deflated again. \\"Looks like we're not getting any numbers at today's party either.\\" * * * Jessie's party was bustling with many people. It was a party hosted by Jessie, the most popular person on 'Face Paper'. I was witnessing the scalability of 'Face Paper' with my own eyes. People are starving for connections. And online, one could be friends with a popular girl like Jessie or at least know what she's up to, even if they couldn't be friends in real life. Jessie approached me with a surprised look. \\"Sung-guk, weren't you going to the Ryan club today?\\" I loosened my tightly tied necktie and unbuttoned the top button of my shirt. [I thought I was going to suffocate to death....] Then, the gazes of female students poured onto me. The mission given by the Ryan club wasn't about whether I would pass or not. The question was whether I would rank first or not. I held a bottle of water instead of beer and scanned the surroundings. Then I shouted. \\"I'm looking for female students who will give me their contact information!\\" Before my words even finished, female students began to flock towards me. Seeing this, Mark and Dennis clinked their beer bottles together. \\"Should've just drunk beer in the dorm room...\\" Jessie somehow got pushed by the crowd to Mark and Dennis's side. At the same time, the door kept opening, and new female students entered. \\"How do they know to come?\\" \\"Someone must have posted it on 'Face Paper'.\\" * * * \\"99?\\" Cameron Winklevoss's brow furrowed. \\"That's too much of a difference from the second place.\\" \\"How many did the second place get?\\" \\"31.\\" Tyler shrugged. \\"Our goal was to get Sung-guk into our club anyway.\\" \\"That's true, but... I never thought he'd be this popular.\\" Cameron smiled enigmatically. \\"Tyler, it seems we need to be more generous if we want to take over 'Face Paper'.\\" \\"Are you sure 'Face Paper' is worth that much?\\" \\"I heard insider information that Micro Saver Corp also tried to buy it. But that Sung-guk kid refused, saying he would grow it further.\\" \\"Should we have approached Mark? That nerd seems like he'd join our side if we were just a bit nicer.\\" Cameron shook his head. \\"Every decision is made by Sung-guk. Mark is just a technician. We need to somehow get our father's hedge fund to invest.\\" \\"Got it. I'll arrange a meeting this weekend and notify them of the results.\\" * * * Drrrk. My phone vibrated. I glanced at my phone while reading a book but didn't pick it up. Mark, who was upgrading 'Face Paper' on Dennis's desk, looked at me. \\"Sung-guk, isn't that the result from the Ryan club?\\" \\"The result is obvious. No one collected more contacts than me.\\" \\"Aren't you too confident? You should check it anyway.\\" \\"I'll check it later, what's the rush.\\" Mark looked at me curiously. \\"Sung-guk, if you're not that interested in the Ryan club, why did you accept the invitation? You could have declined even if you received it.\\" \\"The Ryan club is known for its strong senior-junior relationships within Harvard. 'Face Paper' is growing continuously. In the future, as more investment contacts come in, I thought I'd need the Ryan club's connections to deal more flexibly in American society.

Is this a recognized meaning?","completion":"Yes, the term \\"mudlark\\" indeed has a recognized meaning referring to children who play in mud for fun, alongside its historical and more widely known meaning. Historically, a mudlark was a person, often a child, who scavenged in river mud for objects of value, a practice associated with poverty especially in the areas along the Thames River in London during the 18th and 19th centuries. These individuals were often in dire economic circumstances and resorted to mudlarking to find anything that could be sold or used, such as metal, bones, rope, and coal from ships. However, the playful connotation of \\"mudlark\\" you encountered is also recognized, albeit less formally. This modern reinterpretation focuses on the act of playing in mud, detached from its origins of necessity and survival. The act of children playing in mud for enjoyment captures the imaginative and carefree aspects of childhood, devoid of the historical context of poverty. It represents a broader, more light-hearted understanding of the term. Dictionaries often capture the evolving meanings of words as they are used in different contexts over time. While the historical meaning of \\"mudlark\\" is well-documented and recognized, the playful, non-poverty-related meaning of children joyfully engaging with mud has become a part of the word's contemporary usage, reflecting how language adapts to reflect current understandings and cultural contexts."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

Assuming you're starting with a fresh project, here's a comprehensive guide to set up a React project with Tailwind CSS as a boilerplate. # Step 1: Create a React App First, you need to create a React app. If you have \`npx\` installed (comes with npm 5.2+ and higher), you can create a new React application by running: \`\`\`bash npx create-react-app react-tailwind-boilerplate \`\`\` Navigate into your project directory: \`\`\`bash cd react-tailwind-boilerplate \`\`\` # Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies using npm, by running: \`\`\`bash npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer \`\`\` Then, generate your \`tailwind.config.js\` and \`postcss.config.js\` files: \`\`\`bash npx tailwindcss init -p \`\`\` # Step 3: Configure Tailwind to Remove Unused Styles in Production In your \`tailwind.config.js\`, configure Tailwind to purge unused styles in production by adding the paths to all of your components. Your \`tailwind.config.js\` should look something like this: \`\`\`javascript module.exports = { purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'], darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class' theme: { extend: {}, }, variants: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], } \`\`\` # Step 4: Include Tailwind in Your CSS Open the \`./src/index.css\` file, or create it if it doesn't exist, and replace the existing content with the following Tailwind directives: \`\`\`css @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities; \`\`\` This imports Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes. # Step 5: Start Your React Application Now, you should be all set. Start your application by running: \`\`\`bash npm start \`\`\` Your React application should now be running on \`http://localhost:3000/\`, integrated with Tailwind CSS, ready for you to start building your UI. # Additional Tips - **Customization**: Tailwind is highly customizable. You can edit the \`tailwind.config.js\` file to customize your design theme according to your project's needs. - **Version Control**: Consider adding the newly created project to a version control system like Git. - **Further Reading**: For more advanced configurations and optimizations, refer to [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/). This guide provides you with a simple boilerplate to get started with React and Tailwind CSS. Customize it further based on the requirements of your project."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[이 애송이들아, 너희들은 내가 누군지 꿈에도 모를 것이야.] 곧 방송이 시작됐다. 금주의 핫이슈 코너는 스튜디오에서 진행되는 토크쇼 쉬는 시간에 방영되는 짧은 코너였다. 엘렌 윈프리는 오늘 나온 유명한 배우와 인터뷰를 쭉 진행하다 잠시 쉬어 가겠다며 금주의 핫이슈 코너를 소개했다. “오늘은 ‘페이스 페이퍼’라는 하버드 학생들이 주로 사용하는 SNS에 하루 1달러, 30달러로 한 달 살기 프로젝트를 벌이는 하버드생 전성국 군을 만나 봤습니다. 근데 더 놀라운 게, 전성국 군은 열두 살에 하버드를 입학한 천재라고 하네요.” 동시에 내가 인터뷰한 영상이 나왔다. “성국, 나 네 뒤에 서 있는 거 잡혔어! 데니스, 우리 머리 진짜 잘 자른 것 같아.” 마크가 신나서 떠들어대기 시작했다. 인터뷰는 크게 왜곡 없이 나갔고, 동시에 ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 접속자 수 과다로 서버가 다운되고 말았다.","completion":"Episode 106 I stuffed the dormitory fridge with 30 oranges and 30 hot dogs.

I really need to succeed in this.\\" \\"Alright, just kidding.\\" I quickly took out a hot dog and warmed it in the microwave. Friends from other rooms in the dormitory also saw my 'Face Paper' and offered their support. \\"Sungguk, you must succeed!\\" \\"If there's leftover food, I'll sneak it in front of your room.\\" \\"Thanks.\\" I bit into the hot dog. [This is how I'll live for a month, I guess.] * * * Peter Branton circulated information from 'Face Paper' to his staff. \\"Phillip Academy alumni, and now Harvard freshmen, Sungguk and Mark created this SNS. I've joined too, so you all should check it out.\\" \\"Peter, are you considering this for investment?\\" \\"There are many interesting points. The way students are reacting to it is also fun...\\" Then, an employee who was looking at Sungguk's 'Face Paper' smiled broadly. \\"This guy is really funny. He says he's going to live on 30 for a month, then posts a picture of him stuffing his fridge with hot dogs and oranges he bought for 20 from a nearby mart.\\" \\"I said investors might hesitate because Sungguk and Mark are too young, but he said he'd show his determination.\\" \\"Amazing, this guy. Everyone's going crazy in the comments, offering to buy him meals, inviting him to parties... He's refusing all those acts of kindness for the next month.\\" Peter smiled involuntarily. A genius. He always felt proud when he saw someone with such great determination. Then, a young female employee made a meaningful comment. \\"Peter, this is really interesting. Normally, messaging on phones is only possible if you specify who you're messaging. But with this, you just post it online, and all your friends can see and give feedback. It's fascinating how it changes from one-to-one relationships to one-to-many.\\" \\"It's also interesting because you can easily leave comments even if you're not close.\\" From the young employees' reactions, Peter caught a glimpse of potential. 'So this challenge was meant to show the potential of 'Face Paper'.' Indeed, young people were very interested in broadening their social connections. \\"Miranda, book flight tickets and a hotel reservation for these guys to come to New York the weekend after next month. Oh, make it three people.\\" \\"Didn't you say two people earlier?\\" \\"One is their dorm roommate, who got to know 'Face Paper' after entering college. He seems like the most appropriate monitor. I want to hear a variety of opinions... And make sure it's first class.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Peter had already decided to invest in 'Face Paper', but he hadn't contacted Sungguk yet. He was very interested in Sungguk's 30-day challenge. * * * - Day 7 of the challenge. I was so hungry yesterday that I ended up eating two hot dogs, so today I might have to survive on just one orange. I'm considering whether to buy more hot dogs with the remaining 10. Comments flooded in on my post again. - Sungguk, there's a sale at the nearby mart, five frozen pizzas for 10. Maybe one pizza could last you 2, 3 days? - Sungguk, here oranges are 20 for 3 on sale. - Found a 1 burger place! Sungguk, I'll leave the address. - Sungguk, there's a new restaurant opening this week, they have a 1 dinner buffet for one day only. Everyone was trying to help with my challenge in the comments. [Ah, I'm hungry... Better focus on studying.] Dennis looked at me with worried eyes. \\"Sungguk, you're at the age where you should be growing... Aren't you going to lose too much weight doing this?\\" \\"Ah! That's what I should buy.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Protein shakes. Why didn't I think of that?\\" I quickly searched Amazoness for the cheapest and most abundant protein shake. Including shipping, it was 9.99! I quickly took a screenshot and posted it on 'Face Paper'. - Bought a protein shake for 10. Shipping included, it's a grand price of 9.99. The comments were filled with messages saying it was a wise choice, but also warnings that I might throw up if I drank too much of it. Dennis shook his head. \\"Sungguk, you're really something else.\\" \\"Dennis, how's the screenplay going?\\" \\"Between classes, assignments... and going to parties, I haven't made any progress. Really, I wonder if a trip to New York might spark some inspiration.\\" \\"Dennis, just wait a bit. I'm sure Peter will invite us to New York after a month.\\" \\"Sungguk, how can you be so confident about everything?\\" [How? Well, I'm a former tycoon. I know the mindset of people who invest in businesses better than anyone.] I just smiled. \\"Dennis, I'll talk less until the protein shake arrives. Talking makes me hungry.\\" \\"Got it.\\" Then, an unknown number called. [Should I answer? I'm so hungry...] After hesitating, I answered the call. \\"Hello?\\" - Is this the Harvard student conducting the 'Live on 30 for a Month' project on 'Face Paper'? \\"Yes, that's me. Who is this?\\" - I'm a writer for the 'Ellen Winfrey Show'. I've been following your 'Face Paper'... Would you be available for an interview? The Ellen Winfrey Show? I jumped to my feet. The Ellen Winfrey Show was the top-rated talk show broadcast nationwide in the United States. Of course, I exclaimed. \\"Absolutely!\\" * * * Mark was pacing around the dorm room with excitement. \\"Sungguk, are you really going on the Ellen Winfrey Show?\\" \\"They're coming to Harvard to interview me directly for a small segment introducing this week's issue.\\" \\"Wow, amazing. My parents love that show. Can I hover in the background too?\\" \\"Prepare yourself, Mark and Dennis. When they asked if I had friends to testify, I recommended you two.\\" Mark and Dennis high-fived. \\"Mark, let's go buy some clothes.\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"Sungguk, what will you wear?\\" \\"I spent all my money on the protein shake, so I have no money left. I'll just wear what I have, whatever.\\" For the record, I had already decided on my outfit in my head. Jeans, a gray hoodie, and sneakers. If Charlie Jobs had his black turtleneck, I would have my hoodie. \\"Mark, should we go to the salon and get our hair done?\\" \\"We should ask 'Face Paper' where's a good and cheap salon around here?\\" Mark quickly posted on 'Face Paper'. Comments came in quickly, and Mark and Dennis left the dorm room laughing, off to get their hair done. I mixed a few spoons of protein shake with water and shook it vigorously. Then, I gulped it down. [Really, this tastes like... the water left after washing dishes. Ugh-.] * * * \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'm the writer for the Ellen Winfrey Show's 'This Week's Issue' segment.\\" \\"Hello.\\" I greeted her with a slight bow, the Korean way. \\"Oh, are you Korean?\\" \\"How did you know?\\" \\"My mom is Korean. She taught me to greet like that since I was little.\\" \\"Thank you for recognizing it.\\" Michelle Jona was a lively person. Before turning on the camera for the actual interview, a pre-interview was conducted. Michelle Jona asked me a question. \\"But what everyone's most curious about is why you started this project. Spending 1 a day, 30 for a month as a Harvard student, everyone seems to be wondering why.\\" \\"I'm planning to start a business soon. It might be good to get a good job after graduating from Harvard, but I want to take on as many challenges as possible while I'm young.\\" \\"Oh my, but is it true you entered Harvard at twelve?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Michelle Jona seemed to know quite a bit about me. \\"But why exactly are you doing the 30 for 30 days project if you're planning to start a business?\\" \\"Starting a business is quite risky, you know. I imagined what it would be like if I failed, lost my fortune, and everyone turned their backs on me. I thought about how I would endure that situation and decided to live like this for a month.\\" \\"Imagining the worst-case scenario?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"And you're continuously posting this process on 'Face Paper'. Any particular reason?\\" \\"Firstly, just knowing that someone is watching my project is a big encouragement to complete it. Since the Harvard students know I'm doing this project, they all become watchers of this project.\\" \\"And you have friends to testify for you?\\" \\"Yes, this is my roommate Dennis Shazel, and this is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. We created 'Face Paper' together.\\" I introduced Mark to Michelle Jona. Michelle Jona asked Mark and Dennis if my project was successful. \\"So far, yes. He's really been surviving on hot dogs, oranges, and the protein shake he bought recently.\\" Dennis testified faithfully. \\"Sungguk, so you're planning to start a business with 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Yes, Mark and I are preparing for it.\\" I answered confidently. * * * Mark, Dennis, and I all gathered in the dorm room, waiting for the Ellen Winfrey Show to start. We even skipped classes for this. \\"Sungguk, do you think we looked good?\\" \\"Let's see, Dennis.\\" Mark looked at me seriously. \\"Sungguk, I'm really curious... You're going on TV to promote 'Face Paper', right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Peter Branton is already interested, but was it necessary to go on TV?\\" \\"Mark, if our popularity rises, we can negotiate better terms for investment, right?\\" \\"Are you sure you don't have Warren Buffett living inside you?\\" \\"Maybe...\\" I shrugged. [You kids have no idea who I really am.] The show started soon after. The 'This Week's Hot Issue' segment was a short segment aired during the break of the studio talk show. Ellen Winfrey introduced the segment after interviewing a famous actor. \\"Today, we met with Sungguk Jeon, a Harvard student who is doing a 'Live on 30 for a Month' project on 'Face Paper', a social network mainly used by Harvard students. And what's more surprising is that Sungguk Jeon is a genius who entered Harvard at the age of twelve.\\" My interview footage was shown. \\"Sungguk, I'm in the background! Dennis, our haircuts look really good.\\" Mark started to chatter excitedly. The interview aired without major distortions, and 'Face Paper' servers crashed due to excessive traffic."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[이제 핫도그 좀 먹어볼까.] 나는 냉장고에서 핫도그를 하나 꺼냈다. “성국, 핫도그 데울 때 내 것도 하나 부탁해.” “데니스, 미안하지만 거절할게. 난 정말 이거 꼭 성공해야 한다고.” “알았어. 농담이야.” 나는 얼른 핫도그 하나를 꺼내서 전자레인지에 데웠다. 기숙사의 다른 방 친구들도 내 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 봤는지 응원을 해주기도 했다. “성국, 꼭 성공해!” “음식 남는 거 있으면 네 방 앞에 슬쩍 버릴게.” “고마워.” 나는 핫도그를 한 입 깨물었다. [이렇게 한 달 살아보는 거지, 뭐.] * * 피터 브랜튼이 자신의 참모진들에게 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 자료를 돌렸다. “필립 아카데미 동기이자, 이번에 하버드에 들어간 성국과 마크라는 두 학생이 만든 SNS야. 나도 가입했으니까 다들 가입해봐요.” “피터, 이번 투자 대상으로 보는 거예요?” “흥미로운 지점이 많아. 학생들이 여기 반응하는 방식도 재미있고….” 이때, 한 직원이 성국의 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 보고는 빙긋 웃었다. “이 친구 정말 재미있네요. 하루에 1달러, 한 달 동안 30달러로 살 거라면서 근처 마트에서 20불에 오렌지랑 핫도그 왕창 사서 냉장고에 넣은 사진 찍어 올렸어요.” “내가 성국과 마크가 너무 어려서 투자자들이 망설일 것이라고 했더니, 자신의 의지를 보여주겠대.” “대단하네요, 이 친구. 댓글들에 모두 밥 사준다, 파티 초대하겠다… 다들 난리예요. 그런 호의도 다 거절하겠대요. 앞으로 한 달은요.” 피터는 입가에 저절로 미소가 지어졌다. 천재. 거기다 대단한 의지를 가진 사람을 볼 때면 항상 대견스러웠다. 이때, 젊은 여직원 한 명이 의미심장한 말을 했다. “피터, 이거 정말 재미있어요. 핸드폰으로 서로 메시지를 주고받는 것은 특정 누구를 지칭해야만 가능한 일이잖아요. 근데 이건 인터넷에 올려놓기만 하면, 내 친구들은 다 보고 거기에 대한 피드백을 해주는 거죠. 일대일 관계가 일대다로 변하는 지점이 엄청 흥미로워요.” “친하지 않아도 댓글은 쉽게 달 수 있으니까, 그것도 흥미로워요.” 젊은 직원들의 반응에서 피터는 충분히 가능성을 캐치했다. ‘이 도전을 통해서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’의 가능성도 보여 주겠다는 게 이런 의미였군.’ 확실히 젊은 사람들은 폭넓은 인간관계에 관심이 많았다. “미란다, 한 달 후 주말에 이 친구들 뉴욕으로 오는 비행기 티켓이랑 호텔 예약해줘. 참, 세 명이야.” “아까 두 명이라고 말씀하시지 않았어요?” “기숙사 룸메이트인데, 대학 들어와서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 접한 친구니까 가장 적절한 모니터 요원이 될 것 같아서. 의견도 좀 다양하게 듣고 싶고…. 참, 모두 퍼스트 클래스로 잡아줘.” “네.” 피터는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 투자하기로 마음을 이미 굳혔지만, 성국에게는 연락하지 않았다. 30일 동안 진행될 성국의 도전이 무척 흥미로웠기 때문이다. * - 도전 7일째. 배가 너무 고파서 어제 핫도그 두 개를 먹는 바람에 오늘은 오렌지 하나로 버텨야 할지도 모른다. 남은 10달러로 핫도그를 더 사둘까 고민 중이다. 내가 올린 글에 또 댓글이 쇄도했다. - 성국, 근처 마트에서 지금 냉동 피자 다섯 판에 10달러 세일이야. 피자 한 판으로 2, 3일은 견딜 수 있지 않을까? - 성국, 여긴 오렌지가 20개에 3달러 세일이야. - 1달러 버거집 발견! 성국, 주소 남길게. - 성국, 이번 주 오픈하는 식당에서 저녁 뷔페 1달러 행사한대. 딱 하루야. 모두들 내 도전에 도움을 주는 댓글들이었다. [아, 배고파… 공부나 해야지.] 데니스가 걱정스러운 눈빛으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 넌 한창 자랄 나이인데… 이러다가 살 너무 빠지는 거 아니야?” “아! 그걸 사면 되겠다.” “뭐?” “단백질 셰이크. 왜 그걸 생각 못 했지?” 나는 얼른 아마조네스를 싹 뒤져서 가장 싸고 양 많은 단백질 셰이크를 검색했다. 배송료까지 9.99달러! 나는 얼른 화면을 캡처해서 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올렸다. - 10달러로 단백질 셰이크 구입 완료. 배송료까지 9.99달러라니 가슴이 웅장해지는 가격이다. 댓글에는 현명한 선택이라는 말과 함께, 그거 먹다 토할 수도 있으니 주의하란 말도 엄청 많이 올라왔다. 데니스가 고개를 저었다. “성국, 정말 넌 못 말리겠어.” “데니스, 요즘 시나리오는 잘 진행돼?” “수업 가고, 과제 하고… 파티 가느라 정신없어서 하나도 진전이 없어. 진짜 뉴욕에 다녀오면 좀 아이디어가 샘솟을까 모르겠네.” “데니스, 조금만 기다려. 분명 피터가 우릴 한 달 후에 뉴욕으로 초대할 거야.” “성국, 너는 매사에 어떻게 그렇게 자신 있어?” [어떻게긴. 나 전직 재벌이야. 기업에 돈 투자하는 사람들 마인드는 내가 제일 잘 안다고.] 나는 그저 웃었다. “데니스, 단백질 셰이크 오기 전까지 말 좀 줄일게. 말 많이 하니까 배가 고파.” “알았어.” 이때, 모르는 번호로 전화가 걸려왔다. [받을까, 말까. 배고픈데….] 고민하다가 나는 전화를 받았다. “여보세요.” - 혹시 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 한 달 동안 30달러로 살기 프로젝트를 진행 중인 하버드 재학생 맞나요? “네, 맞는데요. 어디시죠?” - 저는 ‘엘렌 윈프리 쇼’ 담당 작가거든요. ‘페이스 페이퍼’로 저도 지켜보고 있는데… 혹시 인터뷰 가능할까요? 엘렌 윈프리 쇼라고? 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 엘렌 윈프리는 미국 전역에서 방송되고 있는 토크쇼 중에서도 시청률 1위를 달리는 국민 방송이었다. 나는 당연히 외쳤다. “물론이죠!” * 마크가 상기된 얼굴로 기숙사 방을 오갔다. “성국, 정말 엘렌 윈프리 쇼 나간다는 거야?” “이번 주의 이슈 같은 거 소개하는 작은 코너인데, 하버드로 직접 와서 인터뷰해서 갈 거래.” “와, 대박. 그거 우리 엄마랑 아빠도 즐겨 보는 건데. 나도 네 뒤에서 얼쩡거려도 될까?” “마크와 데니스도 나갈 준비 해. 내가 친구들 같이 나가도 되냐니까, 증언해줄 친구들 있으면 더 좋다고 그래서 너희 둘 추천했어.” 마크와 데니스가 손을 마주쳤다. “마크, 우리 옷 사러 가자.” “당연하지.” “성국아, 넌 뭐 입을 거야?” “난 단백질 셰이크 사버려서 이제 돈 없잖아. 입던 옷 입고 나가지, 뭐.” 참고로 난 이미 머릿속으로 내가 입고 나갈 옷을 세팅했다. 청바지에 회색 후드 티셔츠. 그리고 운동화였다. 찰리 잡스에게 검은색 목 티가 있다면 나에게는 후드 티셔츠가 있을 것이다. “마크, 우리 미용실 가서 머리 좀 할까?” “페이스 페이퍼에 물어봐야겠다. 이 근처에 머리 잘하고 싼 미용실 어디냐고?” 마크는 얼른 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 글을 올렸다. 곧 댓글들이 달렸고, 마크과 데니스는 머리를 한다며 웃으며 기숙사 방을 떠났다. 나는 단백질 셰이크를 물에 몇 숟가락 넣고 흔들었다. 그리고 열심히 들이켰다. [정말이지 이 맛은… 설거지하고 남은 물 맛 같아. 으웩-.] * “안녕, 난 미셸 조나야. 엘렌 윈프리 쇼에서 금주의 이슈를 맡고 있는 작가야.” “안녕하세요.” 나는 일부러 한국식으로 고개를 살짝 숙여 인사를 했다. “어머, 한국 사람이야?” “어떻게 아셨어요?” “우리 엄마가 한국 분이셔. 그래서 그렇게 인사하는 거라고 어릴 적부터 얼마나 가르치셨는지 몰라.” “알아봐 주셔서 감사합니다.” 미셸 조나는 쾌활한 성격의 소유자였다. 카메라를 켜고 직접 인터뷰하기 전에 사전 인터뷰가 진행됐다. 미셸 조나는 내게 질문을 했다. “근데 사람들이 가장 궁금해하는 게, 왜 이런 프로젝트를 시작했나 하는 거거든. 하루에 1달러. 한 달에 30달러를 쓰는 프로젝트를 하버드 학생이 하는 이유를 모두 궁금해하는 것 같아.” “저는 조만간 창업을 할 생각이거든요. 하버드를 나와서 좋은 직장을 잡는 게 좋을 수도 있지만, 젊을 때 되도록이면 많은 도전을 해보고 싶어서요.” “어머, 근데 너 정말 하버드를 열두 살에 들어간 거 맞아?” “네.” 미셸 조나는 나에 대해서 제법 많이 알고 있었다. “창업을 하는데, 왜 굳이 30달러 30일 살기 프로젝트를 진행하는 거야?” “창업이라는 게 워낙 위험하잖아요. 혹시 창업을 했다 망해서 재산도 잃고, 사람들도 모두 저에게 등을 돌렸을 때를 떠올려 봤어요. 그럴 때 어떻게 견뎌야 하지… 그 생각을 하면서 한 달을 이렇게 살아보기로 했어요.” “최악의 상황을 상상해본 거구나?” “네.” “참, ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 이 과정을 계속 올리잖아. 특별한 이유가 있어?” “우선 제 프로젝트를 누가 봐준다는 것 자체가 이 프로젝트를 완수하는 데 응원이 많이 되고요. 하버드생들은 제가 이 프로젝트를 진행하는 것을 아니까, 모두가 이 프로젝트의 감시자가 되는 거죠.” “참, 증인이 되어줄 친구들도 있다며?” “네, 여기는 제 룸메이트인 데니스 샤젤이고요. 이쪽은 마크 주크버스예요. 저랑 같이 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 만들었어요.” 나는 마크를 미셸 조나에게 소개했다. 미셸 조나는 마크와 데니스에게 내 프로젝트가 성공적인지 물었다. “아직까지는요. 정말 핫도그와 오렌지 그리고 얼마 전에 산 단백질 셰이크로 견뎌 나가고 있어요.” 데니스는 착실하게 증언해줬다. “성국, 그럼 ‘페이스 페이퍼’로 창업을 할 생각인 거니?” “네, 지금 마크랑 준비 중이에요.” 나는 자신 있게 대답했다. * * 나와 마크 그리고 데니스는 모두 기숙사 방에 모여서 엘렌 윈프리 쇼가 시작하기만을 기다렸다. 그 때문에 수업도 재낀 상황이었다. “성국, 우리 잘 나왔을까?” “한번 봐, 데니스.” 마크가 짐짓 진지한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 근데 나 진짜 궁금한데… ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 노출하기 위해서 방송도 타는 거지?” “응.” “이미 피터 브랜튼이 관심 가지고 있는데, 방송까지 탈 필요가 있었을까?” “마크, 피터 브랜튼이 물론 유명한 투자의 신이지만 우리의 인기가 상승하면 그만큼 유리한 조건으로 투자 유치를 받을 수 있잖아.” “정말 네 속에는 워렌 버핏이 살고 있는 거 아니야?” “그럴지도….” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. [이 애송이들아, 너희들은 내가 누군지 꿈에도 모를 것이야.] 곧 방송이 시작됐다. 금주의 핫이슈 코너는 스튜디오에서 진행되는 토크쇼 쉬는 시간에 방영되는 짧은 코너였다. 엘렌 윈프리는 오늘 나온 유명한 배우와 인터뷰를 쭉 진행하다 잠시 쉬어 가겠다며 금주의 핫이슈 코너를 소개했다. “오늘은 ‘페이스 페이퍼’라는 하버드 학생들이 주로 사용하는 SNS에 하루 1달러, 30달러로 한 달 살기 프로젝트를 벌이는 하버드생 전성국 군을 만나 봤습니다. 근데 더 놀라운 게, 전성국 군은 열두 살에 하버드를 입학한 천재라고 하네요.” 동시에 내가 인터뷰한 영상이 나왔다. “성국, 나 네 뒤에 서 있는 거 잡혔어! 데니스, 우리 머리 진짜 잘 자른 것 같아.” 마크가 신나서 떠들어대기 시작했다. 인터뷰는 크게 왜곡 없이 나갔고, 동시에 ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 접속자 수 과다로 서버가 다운되고 말았다.","completion":"Episode 106 I stuffed the dormitory fridge with 30 oranges and 30 hot dogs.

I'm so busy with parties, I haven't made any progress. Really, I wonder if going to New York will spark some ideas.\\" \\"Dennis, just wait a bit. I'm sure Peter will invite us to New York after a month.\\" \\"Sungguk, how can you be so confident in everything?\\" [How? I'm a former chaebol. I know the mindset of people who invest in companies better than anyone.] I just smiled. \\"Dennis, I'll talk less until the protein shake arrives. Talking makes me hungry.\\" \\"Got it.\\" Then, an unknown number called. [Should I answer? I'm hungry...] After hesitating, I answered the call. \\"Hello?\\" - Is this the Harvard student conducting the 'Live on 30 for a Month' project on 'Face Paper'? \\"Yes, that's me. Who is this?\\" - I'm a writer for the 'Ellen Winfrey Show'. I've been following 'Face Paper'... Would you be available for an interview? The Ellen Winfrey Show? I jumped up from my seat. The Ellen Winfrey Show was a national broadcast talk show leading in ratings across the United States. Of course, I exclaimed. \\"Absolutely!\\" * Mark was pacing back and forth in the dorm room with an excited face. \\"Sungguk, are you really going on the Ellen Winfrey Show?\\" \\"They're coming directly to Harvard for a small segment introducing this week's issue, and they'll interview and leave.\\" \\"Wow, amazing. My mom and dad watch that show too. Can I loiter behind you?\\" \\"Prepare yourself, Mark and Dennis. When I asked if my friends could also appear, they said it would be even better if I had friends to testify, so I recommended you two.\\" Mark and Dennis high-fived. \\"Mark, let's go buy clothes.\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"Sungguk, what will you wear?\\" \\"I've spent my money on the protein shake, so I have no money left. I'll just wear what I have, whatever.\\" For the record, I had already set in my mind what I would wear. Jeans, a gray hoodie, and sneakers. If Charlie Jobs had his black turtleneck, I would have my hoodie. \\"Mark, should we go to the salon and get our hair done?\\" \\"We should ask 'Face Paper'. Where's a good and cheap salon around here?\\" Mark quickly posted on 'Face Paper'. Soon, comments came in, and Mark and Dennis left the dorm room laughing, heading to get their hair done. I mixed a few spoons of protein shake with water and shook it. Then, I drank it earnestly. [Really, this tastes like... the water left after washing dishes. Ugh-.] * \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'm a writer for the Ellen Winfrey Show, handling this week's issue.\\" \\"Hello.\\" I deliberately bowed slightly in the Korean way to greet her. \\"Oh, are you Korean?\\" \\"How did you know?\\" \\"My mom is Korean. She taught me to greet like that since I was little.\\" \\"Thank you for recognizing it.\\" Michelle Jona was a cheerful person. Before turning on the camera for the actual interview, a pre-interview was conducted. Michelle Jona asked me a question. \\"But what people are most curious about is why you started this project. Spending 1 a day, 30 for a month as a Harvard student, everyone seems curious about the reason.\\" \\"I'm planning to start a business soon. It might be good to get a good job after graduating from Harvard, but I want to take on as many challenges as possible while I'm young.\\" \\"Oh my, but is it true you entered Harvard at twelve?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Michelle Jona seemed to know quite a bit about me. \\"But why exactly are you doing the 30 dollars 30 days project if you're planning to start a business?\\" \\"Starting a business is quite risky, you know. I imagined what it would be like if I failed, lost my wealth, and everyone turned their backs on me. Thinking about how to endure that situation, I decided to live like this for a month.\\" \\"Imagining the worst-case scenario?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"And you keep posting this process on 'Face Paper'. Any special reason?\\" \\"First of all, knowing that someone is watching my project itself is a big encouragement for completing this project. Since Harvard students know I'm doing this project, everyone becomes a watcher of this project.\\" \\"Also, you have friends to testify for you, right?\\" \\"Yes, this is my roommate Dennis Shazel, and this is Mark Zuckerberg. We created 'Face Paper' together.\\" I introduced Mark to Michelle Jona. Michelle Jona asked Mark and Dennis if my project was successful. \\"So far, yes. Really surviving on hot dogs, oranges, and the protein shake we bought recently.\\" Dennis testified faithfully. \\"Sungguk, so you're planning to start a business with 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Yes, Mark and I are preparing for it.\\" I answered confidently. * * Mark, Dennis, and I all gathered in the dorm room, waiting for the Ellen Winfrey Show to start. We even skipped classes for this. \\"Sungguk, did we come out well?\\" \\"Let's see, Dennis.\\" Mark looked at me with a serious face. \\"Sungguk, I'm really curious... You're exposing 'Face Paper' by appearing on the show, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Peter Branton is already interested, but was it necessary to go on TV?\\" \\"Mark, although Peter Branton is indeed the investment god, the more popular we become, the more advantageous conditions we can get for investment.\\" \\"Really, do you have Warren Buffett living inside you?\\" \\"Maybe...\\" I shrugged. [You little ones, you have no idea who I am.] The show started soon. The week's hot issue corner was a short segment aired during the break of the studio talk show. Ellen Winfrey introduced the segment after conducting a long interview with a famous actor, taking a short break. \\"Today, we met with Sungguk Jeon, a Harvard student who is conducting a project to live on 1 a day, 30 for a month on 'Face Paper', a social networking site mainly used by Harvard students. And more surprisingly, Sungguk Jeon is a genius who entered Harvard at the age of twelve.\\" My interview footage appeared simultaneously. \\"Sungguk, I'm caught standing behind you! Dennis, I think we really chose the right place for our hair.\\" Mark started to chatter excitedly. The interview aired without major distortions, and simultaneously, 'Face Paper' crashed due to an overload of access."},{"prompt":"processing lerp source code","completion":"Linear interpolation (lerp) is a fundamental operation in many computational fields such as computer graphics, data analysis, and simulations. It's a method for estimating a value within two known values in a linear space. Essentially, it's a way of blending or transitioning smoothly between two values based on a parameter. The most common use case is to find a point that is a certain percentage of the way between two other points. Here's a simple and commonly used example of linear interpolation implemented in several programming languages. This example includes the function to interpolate between two values \`a\` and \`b\` based on the fraction \`t\` where \`t\` is between 0.0 and 1.0. # Python \`\`\`python def lerp(a, b, t): \\"\\"\\"Linear interpolation between a and b with t\\"\\"\\" return a + (b - a) * t # Example usage print(lerp(0, 10, 0.5)) # 5.0 \`\`\` # C++ \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> using namespace std; float lerp(float a, float b, float t) { return a + (b - a) * t; } int main() { cout << lerp(0, 10, 0.5) << endl; // 5 return 0; } \`\`\` # JavaScript \`\`\`javascript function lerp(a, b, t) { return a + (b - a) * t; } console.log(lerp(0, 10, 0.5)); // 5 \`\`\` # Java \`\`\`java public class Main { public static float lerp(float a, float b, float t) { return a + (b - a) * t; } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(lerp(0, 10, 0.5f)); // 5.0 } } \`\`\` These implementations all follow the basic principle of \`a + (b - a) * t\`, where \`a\` and \`b\` are the start and end values respectively, and \`t\` is the interpolant (a value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the weight of the second point). Linear interpolation is useful in various scenarios, including animation, data visualization, and any situation where a smooth transition between values is desirable."},{"prompt":"как в джанго орм реализованы join sql","completion":"В Django ORM для реализации оператора SQL JOIN используются различные подходы, в зависимости от того, какую именно связь вы хотите установить между моделями. Django автоматически создает SQL-запросы с JOIN'ами за вас, когда вы используете его высокоуровневые абстракции. Вот несколько способов, с помощью которых в Django ORM могут быть реализованы JOIN'ы: 1. **ForeignKey**: Если в модели указано поле ForeignKey, Django автоматически создаст JOIN, когда вы обращаетесь к связанной модели. Например, если у вас есть модель \`Author\` и модель \`Book\` со связью ForeignKey с \`Author\`, то при попытке получить автора книги Django сгенерирует SQL соответствующий запрос с JOIN. \`\`\`python book = Book.objects.select_related('author').get(id=1) \`\`\` В этом примере \`select_related\` заставит Django выполнить SQL-запрос с LEFT OUTER JOIN, чтобы получить и книгу, и связанного с ней автора одним запросом. 2. **ManyToManyField**: При использовании поля ManyToManyField Django использует промежуточную таблицу для хранения связей. Когда вы запрашиваете объекты с обеих сторон такой связи, Django автоматически генерирует запросы с JOIN через промежуточную таблицу. \`\`\`python book = Book.objects.prefetch_related('authors').get(id=1) \`\`\` В этом примере, \`prefetch_related\` будет использован для выполнения отдельного запроса для получения всех авторов книги и затем объединения результатов в Python. Это не совсем тот же механизм, что используется для JOIN'ов, но позволяет оптимизировать работу с ManyToMany связями. 3. **reverse relation**: При обратной выборке из связанной модели, когда модель A ссылается на модель B, и вы хотите получить все объекты A, связанные с объектом B, Django автоматически сгенерирует соответствующий запрос с JOIN. \`\`\`python author = Author.objects.get(id=1) books = author.book_set.all() \`\`\` В этом случае внутри \`book_set.all()\` генерируется SQL-запрос с JOIN для получения всех книг данного автора. Django ORM берет на себя тяжелую работу по генерации эффективных SQL-запросов, в том числе с использованием JOIN'ов, позволяя разработчикам фокусироваться на логике приложения, а не на деталях реализации базы данных."},{"prompt":"в чем различия между линукс и виндовс","completion":"Linux и Windows — это две разные операционные системы, которые имеют множество отличий, начиная от основных концепций построения и заканчивая пользовательским интерфейсом и сценариями использования. Вот основные различия между Linux и Windows: 1. **Основа и исходный код**: - **Linux** основан на Unix и является открытым исходным кодом. Это означает, что исходный код доступен для всех, кто желает его изучить, модифицировать или распространять. - **Windows** разработан компанией Microsoft как закрытая система. Исходный код Windows не доступен для общественности, и операционная система распространяется на коммерческой основе. 2. **Лицензирование**: - **Linux** можно загрузить и использовать бесплатно. Хотя некоторые коммерческие версии Linux могут требовать оплаты за дополнительную поддержку. - **Windows** является платной операционной системой, для использования которой требуется приобрести лицензию. 3. **Интерфейс пользователя**: - **Linux** предлагает разнообразие графических пользовательских интерфейсов (GUI), таких как GNOME, KDE, XFCE и более специализированные, такие как Enlightenment. - **Windows** имеет собственный стандартизированный графический интерфейс, который эволюционировал от Windows 1.0 до текущей версии Windows 10/11. 4. **Поддержка программного обеспечения**: - **Linux** хорошо подходит для серверов, разработки программного обеспечения, и имеет широкий ассортимент открытого и бесплатного программного обеспечения. Однако он может испытывать трудности с запуском программного обеспечения, разработанного исключительно для Windows, без использования эмуляторов или слоев совместимости, таких как Wine. - **Windows** имеет широкую поддержку коммерческого и проприетарного программного обеспечения, в том числе большинства видеоигр и профессионального ПО. 5. **Файловая система**: - **Linux** традиционно использует файловые системы типа ext3, ext4, Btrfs, XFS и другие. - **Windows** использует файловые системы NTFS, FAT32 и exFAT. 6. **Обновления**: - **Linux** предоставляет пользователю больший контроль над обновлениями системы, позволяя обновлять как отдельные пакеты, так и всю систему, когда пользователь решит, что это подходящее время. - **Windows** обновляется автоматически по умолчанию, что может привести к неожиданным перезапускам и установке обновлений в неподходящее время. 7. **Безопасность**: - **Linux** считается более безопасной операционной системой в силу своей архитектуры, открытости исходного кода и меньшей популярности среди обычных пользователей, что делает его менее привлекательной целью для вирусов и вредоносного ПО. - **Windows** имеет большую долю рынка среди десктопных компьютеров и, следовательно, чаще становится целью вирусов и вредоносных программ. Microsoft активно работает над обеспечением безопасности своей системы через регулярные обновления и встроенные инструменты безопасности. Каждая система имеет свои преимущества и недостатки и лучше подходит для разных задач и пользовательских предпочтений."},{"prompt":"hey","completion":"Hello!

The owl symbol, specifically related to wisdom, isn't directly available in standard Unicode characters. Yet, you can use the owl emoji 🦉 as a modern, widely recognizable digital symbol of wisdom. For symbols related to knowledge within a historical or cultural context, you might consider the following, although not all of them might be directly represented in Unicode: 1. **Lamp or Light** - Often used to symbolize enlightenment and knowledge. A close representation in Unicode could be the electric light bulb emoji 💡, symbolizing a bright idea or knowledge. 2. **Book** - A universal symbol for knowledge, learning, and academia. In Unicode, you can use the open book emoji 📖. 3. **Tree of Knowledge** - While not directly represented in Unicode, the tree is a powerful symbol of growth, knowledge, and connection. A general tree emoji 🌳 can be used to symbolize this. 4. **Rod of Asclepius (⚕)** - While more closely associated with medicine and healing, the Rod of Asclepius represents knowledge in the healing arts. It is symbolized with the staff and serpent emoji ⚕️, a part of Unicode. 5. **Caduceus (☤)** - Often confused with the Rod of Asclepius, the Caduceus (two snakes winding around a winged staff) is another symbol that has been associated with knowledge and commerce. It is represented in Unicode as ☤. 6. **Ankh (☥)** - An ancient Egyptian symbol that represents life but is also associated with knowledge and wisdom. It's available in Unicode as ☥.

Here are some notable symbols and their meanings, though it’s important to note that these are not represented in a simple Unicode character format outside of emojis: 1. **The Owl of Athena**: In Greek mythology, the owl is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, often associated with Athena, the goddess of wisdom. This symbol has been used in various forms of art and literature throughout history. 2. **The Tree of Knowledge**: This symbol originates from the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is a profound symbol of the pursuit of knowledge and the consequences thereof. 3. **The Lamp of Diogenes**: Symbolizing the search for truth or knowledge, this lamp relates to the story of Diogenes the Cynic, who is said to have carried a lamp in daylight, claiming to be searching for an honest man. 4. **The Caduceus and Rod of Asclepius**: Though often associated with medicine and healing, these staffs also symbolize knowledge and wisdom in the context of health and science. As mentioned, the Rod of Ascleus (a staff with a single serpent) is a traditional symbol of medicine and healing knowledge, while the Caduceus (a staff with two serpents and wings) has been mistakenly used in this context but originally represented the Greek god Hermes, associated with wisdom in transitions and boundaries. 5. **The Book**: Throughout history, the book has been a universal symbol of knowledge, learning, and scholarship. From ancient scrolls to modern libraries, books embody the preservation and dissemination of human knowledge. 6. **The Ankh**: An ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol known as the “key of life” or the “cross of life”, represents life and immortality but is also associated with wisdom and insight into the mystical and divine. 7. **The Scales of Maat**: In ancient Egyptian culture, the goddess Maat represented truth, justice, balance, and morality. The scales of Maat, on which hearts were weighed against the feather of truth, symbolize the pursuit of knowledge through a balanced and moral life. 8. **The Endless Knot**: In various spiritual traditions including Buddhism, the endless knot represents the interconnectedness of all things. It symbolizes the unity of thought and action, words and deeds, wisdom and compassion.

[이건 열두 살의 순진한 눈 깜빡임이야. 데니스, 내 앞에서 뭘 그렇게 놀라?] 데니스는 그제야 머쓱한 듯 머리를 긁적였다. “아, 미안… 난 혹시 오해하나 싶어서.” “데니스, 난 솔직히 연애 잘 몰라. 모태솔로잖아.” 열두 살에 모태솔로는 창피한 일이 아니었다. “난 고등학교 때 잠시 사귄 애가 있긴 했어. 근데 공부하다 보니까 바빠서 헤어지고 정신없었어. 그나저나 성국아, 너는 진짜 연애 안 해?” “응. 성인이 되기 전에 연애하는 거 아니야. 대한민국에서는 모두 그래.” [연애. 저번 생에서 엄청 많이 해봤지만, 다 소용 없었어. 사람은 원래 외로운 존재이고, 인생은 혼자 사는 거야.] 나는 주머니에 손을 넣고 터덜터덜 뉴욕의 거리를 걸었다. * * * 미셸이 소개해준 남학생이 우리를 맞았다. 남학생은 드럼 스틱이 든 가방을 옆으로 메고 있었다. “안녕하세요. 마일즈라고 해요. 미셸 누나한테 연락받았어요.” “전 데니스이고, 이쪽은 성국이라고 제 룸메이트예요.” “저도 그 프로 봤어요. 한 달 동안 30달러로 살기요. 그거 보고 저도 다음에 한번 해보려고요. 음악 하는 사람들도 미래가 불확실한 건 마찬가지거든요.” [알지. 잘 알지.] 마일즈는 나에 대해서는 이미 조금 알고 있었다. “참, 시나리오 쓰시는 분이 누구세요?” “제가 쓸 건데요. 근데 성국이랑 같이 쓸까 논의 중이에요. 제가 생각한 건 원래 드럼 치는 중학생 이야기였는데, 뉴욕의 대학생 설정으로 바꾸자고 한 게 성국이거든요.” “제가 최대한 알려 드릴게요.” 마일즈는 우선 학교 구경을 시켜줬다. 이곳은 나도 처음 와보는 곳이었다. 뉴욕에 위치한 학교답게 건물 하나에서 모든 게 이뤄지는 작은 캠퍼스를 소유한 대학이었지만, 교수진은 모두 미국 음악계에서 중요한 위치를 차지한 사람들이었다. “저는 이분에게 드럼을 배우고 있어요. 존 키이스라고요, 드럼계에서는 그냥 레전드예요.” “성격이 어떠세요? 데니스는 드럼 배울 때 선생님이 너무 무서워서 그만뒀다고 했거든요.” “선생님들마다 다르긴 한데, 존은 무서운 편이죠. 정말 수업 시간에 들어가기 전에 심장이 벌렁거릴 때도 많고… 우리끼리 그런 이야기 해요. 존은 드럼 스틱으로 우리를 치는 게 아니라 말로 우리를 때린다고요. 정말 수업 끝나고 나면 멘탈이 너덜너덜해진다니까요.” 마일즈는 존 키이스에 대해서 여러 가지 이야기를 해줬다. 수업 방식부터 잘하는 말 등. 데니스는 모든 것을 놓치지 않고 메모했다. “드럼 한번 쳐보실래요?” 마일즈는 데니스에게 드럼 스틱을 내밀었다. “오래전에 치고 안 쳐서 잘 칠 자신이 없는데요.” “그냥 한번 쳐보세요. 예전 생각 나고 좋을 거예요.” 데니스는 마일즈가 내민 드럼 스틱을 잡았다. 그리고 드럼 앞에 앉아 처음엔 몇 번 이것저것 소리를 내기 시작했다. 그러더니 짧은 연주곡 하나를 그대로 연주했다. 마일즈가 감탄스러운 눈으로 데니스를 쳐다봤다. “잘 치시는데요?” “아니에요. 이 곡 하나만 그때 죽도록 연습했거든요.” 데니스는 아쉬운 듯 드럼 스틱을 놨다. * * * 나와 데니스는 피터와의 약속 장소로 터덜터덜 걸어갔다. 인터뷰를 마친 데니스의 얼굴에는 아련한 그리움 같은 게 어려 있었다. “데니스, 드럼 포기한 거 후회하지 않아?” “가끔 후회해. 그때 그 선생님의 말에 상처받지 말고 내 실력을 더 갈고닦았으면 어땠을까. 그런 생각 하거든.” “데니스, 영화의 주인공이 그런 성격이면 어떨까. 왜, 채찍을 가하면 가할수록 강해지는 사람 있잖아. 독한 말을 들으면 언제고 저 사람의 말을 뛰어넘어 주겠어! 이런 독한 마음을 품는 거지. 연습도 더 열심히 하고….” “그러는 사이에 그 선생님이랑은 엄청 갈등하고?” “응. 20대 초반에 연애도 하고 다른 친구들처럼 휴가도 가고 해야 하는데, 그러는 사이에 주인공은 연애나 그 외의 것들도 모두 포기하는 거야.” “성국, 너무 재미있을 것 같은데….” 데니스의 눈빛이 또다시 반짝였다. 역시 예술가들은 달랐다. 무언가를 향해 달려갈 때 가장 빛이 났다. “나, 뉴욕은 처음인데… 정말 이곳에는 곳곳에 젊은 예술가들이 사는 것 같아. 성국, 넌 뉴욕 와봤어?” 그러고 보니 예전에 그레이스와 지내던 곳 근처였다. “필립 아카데미 들어가기 전에 이곳 숙소에서 지냈어.” [그레이스는 아직 여기 살 텐데….] 이때, 익숙한 얼굴의 한 사람이 반갑게 미소를 지으며 다가왔다. “성국이 맞아?” “그레이스!” [호랑이도 제 말 하면 온다더니… 맨해튼이 좁긴 좁지.] “성국아, 뉴욕엔 어쩐 일이야?” “뉴욕에 일이 있어서요. 여기는 제 룸메이트 데니스요.” 피터와의 약속으로 온 것이라 그레이스에게 따로 연락은 하지 않았었다. “그레이스. 안 그래도 부탁드릴 일이 있어서 연락하려고 했어요. 저 이번에 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 관련해서 계약하려고 하거든요. 효진 그룹에서 계약서 좀 검토해 주셨으면 해서요.” “그런 건 당연히 부탁해야지. 근데 어디 가는 길이야?” “아, 피터라고, 저희 대학 선배이자 투자자가 되실 분이랑 저녁 먹으러요. 그레이스도 같이 가실래요?” “내가 가도 되는 자리야?” “제가 피터한테 물어볼게요.” 나는 얼른 전화기를 꺼내서 피터에게 연락을 했다. 나를 돌봐준 선생님 같은 분이라는 말에 피터는 그레이스를 보고 싶다는 말까지 했다. “그레이스, 7시에 울프 스테이크에서 보기로 했어요. 시간 맞춰 오세요.” “알았어. 나보고 그 사람 좀 제대로 봐달라는 거지?” “그럼요.” [사실은 그레이스, 피터 좋은 사람 같아서 소개해 주려는 거야. 혼맥만큼 좋은 인맥도 없기도 하고.] 그레이스는 어서 가서 준비해야겠다며 근처 아파트로 들어갔다. 데니스가 나를 보더니 싱긋 웃었다. “성국, 이건 내 상상일 수도 있는데. 너 혹시 피터에게 그레이스 소개해 주려는 거 아니야?” 뜨끔. [너무 티 났나?]","completion":"Episode 108 Peter came out to the airport to meet us in person. \\"You all must have had a hard time coming here. It feels like it's been about a month since I last saw you, and you all look like college students now.\\" \\"Aren't you busy?\\" \\"It's Friday night. I try to rest on weekends as much as possible. Of course, except for important investment matters....\\" Peter personally drove us to the hotel in his car. \\"Rest well today, and I'll see you at lunch tomorrow.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" After dropping us off in front of the hotel, Peter left. Mark looked at me with a puzzled face. \\"Sung-guk, why doesn't Peter say a word about 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Well. He invited you guys not because of 'Face Paper,' but as a school senior. Maybe he's trying to give off that vibe. Mark, let's think about that tomorrow, I'm really craving something right now.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"Steak. It's on me!\\" * * * \\"Sung-guk, isn't this place expensive?\\" Dennis hesitated a bit. [The stocks of Samjeon Electronics and Amazoness are still rising this week....] Both of them didn't know that I was investing in stocks or owning land. \\"I've been living on 30 a month, so I've saved up a lot of allowance.\\" [I'm a guy sponsored by Hyojin Group.] Hyojin Group sent me a generous allowance for tuition and dormitory fees, including a kind of dignity maintenance fee. Of course, in return, I had to show my face in the Junho Foundation magazine from time to time. \\"Ah, right.... Anyway, I'll eat well. If it's not enough, I'll chip in too.\\" \\"Got it.\\" The three of us sat down and ordered steaks. Mark looked at the steak with an excited face. \\"When I was a kid, I came to New York with my parents and ate here. I thought it was really delicious back then too.... Thanks to Sung-guk, I'm eating it now.\\" \\"Eat a lot.\\" I took a bite of the steak. [Ah, is this the taste of success?] Of course, success wouldn't taste just like a steak. But what's clear is that I'm now in a position where I can comfortably buy this without worrying about anyone's eyes. \\"New York really feels different. Everything is so fast....\\" For Dennis, who is from Ohio, New York was almost like a new world. \\"Dennis, if you become a movie director, you'll probably live in New York or LA. Think of it as practice.\\" \\"Everyone thinks that after graduating from Harvard, they'll just go into a decent company and become a salaried worker... I'm worried I might end up poor and unable to make money if I say I'm going to make movies.\\" Dennis expressed his anxiety about the uncertain future. [Dennis, don't worry. You'll be hugely successful.] I wanted to say that, but I held back. \\"Dennis, if directing doesn't work out, come to us. I'll hire you at our company. A talent like you is needed everywhere.\\" \\"Thanks for saying that, Sung-guk.\\" Mark looked at me with a worried face. \\"Sung-guk, you always believe that we will succeed, but... will we really be okay?\\" \\"Mark, you have to believe you'll succeed to even get close, right? You can't just not try because of negative thoughts.\\" \\"Right....\\" \\"Let's enjoy our meal today, and worry about tomorrow when it comes.\\" I cut a big piece of steak and put it in my mouth. Really, after a month of eating hot dogs, oranges, and protein shakes, the steak here tasted even better. * * * Peter's company was overlooking Ground Zero, where the traces of the 911 attacks were still visible. Knock. Knock. The door opened, and Miranda came in with Sung-guk and Mark. \\"Peter, you have guests.\\" Peter greeted us with a happy face. \\"Sung-guk, Mark. Did you rest well?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Miranda, could you get us something to drink, please?\\" \\"Yes, Peter.\\" I unconsciously walked towards the window. From the office, Ground Zero was clearly visible. It felt like a giant black hole had formed between the skyscrapers of New York. \\"Actually, my office was originally in the World Trade Center. It feels wrong to say I was lucky, but... I didn't go to the company that morning because I had a meeting.\\" Mark and I didn't say anything, a bit shocked. Many Americans died in the 911 attacks. \\"It's been a few years, but it seems like people forget quickly. I lost a partner I worked with all my life that day, and I took a break from work for a while because of the shock. After experiencing that, my attitude towards life changed. I got this office here to never forget that day.\\" Peter smiled apologetically. \\"Did I talk about something too heavy?\\" \\"No. It must have been really tough back then, please tell us next time how you overcame it.\\" \\"Let's do that. Now, shall we sit down and talk about work seriously?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I finally sat down at the negotiation table. * * * Peter led the conversation comfortably. \\"Our company's employees have discussed the value of 'Face Paper' a lot during the past month. And they considered the biggest risk to be your and Mark's qualifications as representatives. But let me be honest.\\" Peter paused for a moment, looking back and forth between me and Mark. [Hurry up and say it, Peter. My heart is pounding!] I almost blurted out my past life's personality, but I patiently waited. Peter smiled slightly, lifting the corner of his mouth. \\"It's too obvious that you two are the right ones to lead the young 'Face Paper.' We want to support you to grow unimpeded. Here are our contract terms.\\" Peter handed over the documents. Mark and I reviewed the documents. Peter's words about recognizing Mark and me as co-managers and providing full support were not empty. The condition was to provide full investment for the next three years while ensuring that Mark and I maintain equal maximum shares. \\"Of course, our investment alone will suffice for the early stages, but as it grows, more capital will be needed. Then, I'll become a flexible investment advisor for you.\\" It was a very favorable condition, both personally and in many ways. Of course, Peter was not going to miss out on the returns. Still, the contract conditions did not threaten our management rights like Jesse's father or the Winklevoss twins, which was very favorable. \\"What do you think, both of you?\\" Mark looked at me with a dazed face. I maintained my poker face as much as possible and then slowly said. \\"Tonight, Mark and I will pay for dinner. We're going to work together from now on.\\" Peter smiled broadly. \\"Great!\\" * * * Mark still looked dazed as he looked at me. \\"Sung-guk, is it okay to decide so quickly?\\" [Of course. Mark, if you knew how many contracts I've seen and signed in my previous life, you'd be shocked.] \\"Yeah. It's a good condition. Our management rights are clearly protected. And I'll contact a lawyer I know to adjust the detailed clauses of the contract. They're lawyers who deal with conglomerates in South Korea, so they won't include any disadvantageous clauses.\\" \\"Oh, okay.... Honestly, I like Peter too. Unlike Jesse's father or other people, he feels comfortable.\\" \\"Mark, let's not trust too much until we sign the contract.\\" \\"Sung-guk, you really seem like the most cautious twelve-year-old I know.\\" [Of course. Mark, you might not know yet, but we have just 10 years left until we become the richest in the world.] I smiled. At that moment, an advertisement for Samjeon Electronics played on the monitor attached to the elevator. I was ready to surpass the Samjeon Group. * * * Dennis and I headed to the Manhattan School of Music in New York. The Manhattan School of Music is a famous college that focuses on practical music. \\"Mark said he's too tired from the meeting to come.\\" \\"Sung-guk, aren't you tired?\\" \\"No. I'm twelve years old.\\" I grinned. \\"Michelle helped a lot this time. She said she knew someone at the Manhattan School of Music and introduced me.\\" [Hmm... suspicious....] \\"Dennis, are you not meeting Michelle?\\" At my question, Dennis jumped in surprise. \\"Oh, no... Sung-guk, we're not like that.\\" \\"I was just asking.\\" Blink. Blink. [This is the innocent blinking of a twelve-year-old. Dennis, why are you so surprised in front of me?] Dennis then awkwardly scratched his head. \\"Ah, sorry... I thought you might misunderstand.\\" \\"Dennis, I honestly don't know much about dating. I'm a lifelong single.\\" Being a lifelong single at twelve wasn't embarrassing. \\"I had a girlfriend for a while in high school. But I was so busy studying that we broke up and I was swamped. Anyway, Sung-guk, have you really never dated?\\" \\"Yeah. You're not supposed to date before you're an adult. That's how it is in South Korea.\\" [Dating. I did it a lot in my previous life, but it was all useless. People are inherently lonely beings, and life is something you live alone.] I put my hands in my pockets and trudged through the streets of New York. * * * The male student introduced by Michelle greeted us. He was carrying a bag with drumsticks on his side. \\"Hello. I'm Miles. Michelle noona contacted me.\\" \\"I'm Dennis, and this is Sung-guk, my roommate.\\" \\"I also saw that program. Living on 30 for a month. I thought I'd try it too next time. Musicians also face uncertain futures.\\" [I know. I know well.] Miles seemed to already know a bit about me. \\"Who's writing the script?\\" \\"I'm going to write it. But we're discussing whether to write it together with Sung-guk. My original idea was about a middle school student playing drums, but Sung-guk suggested changing it to a college student setting in New York.\\" \\"I'll tell you everything I can.\\" Miles first showed us around the school. This was my first time here too. As expected of a school in New York, it was a small campus where everything happened in one building, but the faculty were all important figures in the American music scene. \\"I'm learning drums from this person. John Keith, he's just a legend in the drum world.\\" \\"What's his personality like? Dennis said he quit playing drums because his teacher was too scary.\\" \\"It varies by teacher, but John is on the scary side. Really, there are times when my heart pounds before class... We joke among ourselves that John doesn't hit us with drumsticks but with his words. Really, after class, our mental state is shredded.\\" Miles told us various stories about John Keith. From his teaching methods to the harsh words he used. Dennis took notes on everything without missing a beat. \\"Do you want to try playing the drums?\\" Miles offered the drumsticks to Dennis. \\"I haven't played in a long time, so I'm not confident.\\" \\"Just try it. It'll bring back memories and feel good.\\" Dennis took the drumsticks offered by Miles. Then, he sat in front of the drums and started making various sounds at first. Then, he played a short piece exactly. Miles looked at Dennis with admiration. \\"You play well?\\" \\"No. I just practiced this piece to death back then.\\" Dennis put down the drumsticks with a hint of regret. * * * Dennis and I walked to the place where we promised to meet Peter. Dennis's face held a distant longing after the interview. \\"Dennis, do you regret giving up on drums?\\" \\"Sometimes. What if I hadn't been hurt by that teacher's words and had worked harder on my skills? I think about that.\\" \\"Dennis, what if the protagonist of the movie had that kind of personality? You know, there are people who get stronger the more they're whipped. When they hear harsh words, they think, 'Someday, I'll surpass what that person said!' They harbor such fierce determination. And they practice even harder....\\" \\"And they have a lot of conflicts with that teacher?\\" \\"Yeah. In their early 20s, they should be dating like other friends and going on vacations, but the protagonist gives up everything else for it.\\" \\"Sung-guk, that sounds really interesting....\\" Dennis's eyes sparkled again. Artists truly shone when they were pursuing something. \\"Me, it's my first time in New York... It really feels like this place is full of young artists living everywhere. Sung-guk, have you been to New York before?\\" Come to think of it, it was near where I stayed with Grace. \\"I stayed in a dorm here before entering Phillips Academy.\\" [Grace is probably still living here....] Just then, a familiar face approached with a warm smile. \\"Sung-guk, is that you?\\" \\"Grace!\\" [They say if you talk about a tiger, it will come... Manhattan really is small.] \\"Sung-guk, what brings you to New York?\\" \\"I'm here for business in New York. This is Dennis, my roommate.\\" I hadn't contacted Grace separately because we came for a meeting with Peter. \\"Grace. Actually, I was going to contact you because I have a favor to ask. I'm about to sign a contract related to 'Face Paper.' I was hoping Hyojin Group could review the contract for me.\\" \\"Of course, you should ask for that. But where are you headed?\\" \\"Oh, I'm going to have dinner with Peter, a senior from our college and a potential investor. Grace, would you like to join us?\\" \\"Would it be okay for me to join?\\" \\"I'll ask Peter.\\" I quickly took out my phone and contacted Peter. When I mentioned she was like a teacher who took care of me, Peter even said he wanted to meet Grace. \\"Grace, let's meet at Wolf Steak at 7. Be there on time.\\" \\"Got it. You want me to properly check him out, right?\\" \\"Exactly.\\" [Actually, Grace, I think Peter is a good person, so I wanted to introduce you. There's no better network than a marriage network.] Grace entered a nearby apartment, saying she needed to get ready. Dennis looked at me and smiled. \\"Sung-guk, this might just be my imagination, but are you trying to set up Peter with Grace?\\" I flinched. [Did I make it too obvious?]"},{"prompt":"As an experienced data engineer, The growth rate of DAU/MAU has dropped a lot. Analyze what might be the reason? Find out what factors may have contributed to the decline in DAU/MAU?","completion":"The DAU/MAU ratio, which stands for Daily Active Users over Monthly Active Users, is a crucial metric in analyzing the health and engagement level of an online platform or app. It measures what fraction of your monthly users engages with your service on a daily basis. A declining DAU/MAU ratio can signal potential problems in user engagement, retention, or acquisition. To analyze the reasons for a significant drop in this ratio, we must look at several possible factors that may have contributed to this decline: # 1. User Experience Degradation - **Bugs and Performance Issues:** If new updates or versions of the app introduce bugs or degrade performance, daily users may become frustrated and reduce their usage. - **UI/UX Changes:** Sometimes, changes meant to improve the user interface or experience can backfire if not properly tested with the user base. Radical changes might disorient or dissatisfy existing users. # 2. Lack of Fresh Content or Features - Users might lose interest if the app or platform does not frequently update its content or introduce new features. The content or the service provided might become stale or redundant. # 3. Increased Competition - New or improved competitor platforms might attract your users, impacting your DAU/MAU ratio. Users always seek the best experience and value, which can shift if competitors offer something more compelling. # 4. Seasonality and Market Trends - Some platforms experience fluctuating usage due to seasonal trends or specific market events. For example, a sports app might see lower engagement off-season. # 5. Changes in User Behavior or Demographics - Changes in your user base, such as a shift in demographics or user preferences, can impact engagement if your platform does not adapt accordingly. # 6. Marketing and User Acquisition Strategies - A decrease in effective marketing efforts or the cessation of promotional campaigns can reduce the influx of new users or re-engagement of dormant users. - Overreliance on low-quality user acquisition channels may increase the MAU without a proportional increase in engaged DAU. # 7. Technical or Accessibility Issues - Issues related to app accessibility in different regions, such as slow loading times in areas with poor internet connectivity, can affect user engagement. - Platform not optimized for various devices or screen sizes can also contribute to reduced usage. # 8. Changes in Social Trends or Sentiments - Negative publicity or social media trends can quickly change user sentiment towards a platform, influencing engagement metrics. # Investigating the Decline To comprehensively understand the decline in the DAU/MAU ratio, you should: - **Analyze user feedback:** Look into customer support tickets, app reviews, and social media mentions for insights into user complaints or requests. - **Review recent changes:** Correlate the timing of the decline with recent updates, marketing campaigns, or external events. - **Perform cohort analysis:** Examining how different groups of users behave can provide insights into which user segments are most affected. - **Use A/B testing:** Test changes in a controlled environment to understand their impact on user behavior and engagement. - **Monitor competitors:** Keep an eye on competitors for shifts in user preferences or to identify features that might be attracting your users.

These dimensions can include temporal trends, user behavior segmentation, feature usage, and technical performance, among others. By dissecting the problem through these lenses, we can identify patterns and anomalies that may be contributing to the decline. # Temporal Dimension - **Trend Analysis**: Examine daily and monthly active user trends over time to identify any sudden drops or patterns that correlate with product changes, market events, or external factors. - **Seasonality & Cohort Analysis**: Investigate if there's a seasonal pattern affecting usage or if specific cohorts (e.g., users who signed up during a certain period) show different behavior. # User Behavior Segmentation - **User Segments**: Divide the user base into segments based on their activity levels, acquisition channels, demographics, etc., to see if the decline is concentrated in specific segments. - **Feature Usage Analysis**: Look into how different user segments interact with various features of the platform. A decline in engagement could be linked to underperforming or ignored features. # Geographical Dimension - **Regional Analysis**: Assess if the decline is concentrated in certain geographical areas. This might unveil region-specific issues, such as increased competition or market saturation. # Technical Performance - **Performance Metrics**: Analyze system performance metrics to identify any bottlenecks or issues correlating with the user engagement drop. Slow load times, for instance, can significantly impact user experience. - **Device and Platform Analysis**: Evaluate usage by device type and platform (iOS, Android, web, etc.) to identify if technical issues on specific platforms are causing the decline. # Content and Engagement - **Content Analysis**: For platforms reliant on content, evaluate if changes in content strategy or the freshness of content correlate with user engagement metrics. - **Engagement Initiatives**: Review the impact of recent engagement or re-engagement campaigns to see if they are failing to resonate with the target audience. # Actionable Steps for Data Engineering 1. **Enhance Data Collection**: Ensure you're capturing rich, granular data across user interactions, system performance, and engagement initiatives. This might involve instrumenting additional logging or integrating external data sources. 2. **Improve Data Quality**: Clean, deduplicate, and validate data to ensure analyses are based on reliable information. 3. **Build or Enhance Data Pipelines**: Create or optimize data pipelines for real-time analysis to more quickly identify trends and respond to changes in user engagement. 4. **Develop Dashboards and Reporting Tools**: Provide stakeholders with intuitive dashboards that highlight key metrics and trends across the dimensions discussed. This enables quick identification of areas needing attention. 5. **Implement Advanced Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict trends, identify segments at risk of churn, or recommend actions to improve engagement. 6. **A/B Testing Framework**: Establish or refine the framework for A/B testing to methodically evaluate the impact of changes. By focusing on these dimensions and steps, a data engineer can contribute significantly to understanding and addressing the decline in the DAU/MAU ratio. This approach not only aids in diagnosing the current issue but also enhances the platform's overall capability to respond to future challenges efficiently."},{"prompt":"What metrics can be used to evaluate this DAU and MAU drop?","completion":"When evaluating the drop in DAU (Daily Active Users) and MAU (Monthly Active Users), a variety of metrics can be used to understand the underlying causes and measure the impact of changes made to improve these key performance indicators (KPIs). Here's a rundown of essential metrics that can provide valuable insights: # 1. User Retention Rate This measures the percentage of users who return to the app or platform after their first visit within a specific period. A declining user retention rate can directly impact your DAU and MAU, indicating issues with user engagement or satisfaction. # 2. User Churn Rate Churn rate represents the proportion of users who stop using the platform within a given timeframe. An increase in churn rate could be a leading indicator of a drop in DAU and MAU, suggesting dissatisfaction or lack of interest among users. # 3. Session Length and Depth These metrics provide insights into user engagement: - **Session Length**: The average amount of time a user spends on your platform during a single session. - **Session Depth**: The average number of pages, screens, or actions taken by a user during a single session. Shorter sessions and fewer interactions can indicate diminishing interest or frustration with the user experience. # 4. Acquisition Channels Efficiency Understanding from which channels (organic search, paid ads, referral, etc.) users are coming can help identify which are underperforming. A drop in efficient user acquisition could lead to lower DAU and MAU. # 5. Active Users The granularity within DAU and MAU can be insightful: - **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: The number of unique users who engage with the app in a 24-hour period. - **Weekly Active Users (WAU)**: Similar to DAU but measured weekly. - **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Unique users engaging over a month. Comparing these metrics can help identify specific periods of drop-off or disengagement. # 6. New vs. Returning Users This metric differentiates between new users and those who have returned, providing insights into how well the platform retains versus attracts users. # 7. Stickiness Ratio Stickiness refers to how often users return to your app or platform, usually calculated as DAU divided by MAU. A drop in this ratio signifies declining engagement. # 8. Conversion Rate This measures the percentage of users who take a desired action (e.g., making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter) and is crucial for apps or platforms with a specific conversion goal. Decreases here can reflect reduced engagement or user dissatisfaction. # 9. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) These measure user satisfaction and the likelihood of users recommending your platform to others, respectively. They can provide early warnings about issues affecting your DAU and MAU. # 10. Error Rates and Performance Metrics High error rates or poor performance (long load times, crashes) can significantly impact user experience and, consequently, your active user metrics. # Final Consideration Incorporating a combination of these metrics into your analysis will provide a comprehensive view of the factors affecting DAU and MAU. It’s crucial to not only monitor these metrics but also to delve deeper into user feedback and behavior to understand the \`\`why’’ behind the numbers."},{"prompt":"How about the impact of operating platforms ? such as desktop vs mobile? Android vs IOS?","completion":"The impact of operating platforms, including desktop vs. mobile and Android vs. iOS, on DAU (Daily Active Users) and MAU (Monthly Active Users) can be significant and multifaceted. These distinctions matter because user behavior, preferences, and engagement levels often vary widely across different platforms. To understand and adapt to these impacts, it's essential to analyze metrics and user feedback specific to each platform. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how these distinctions might influence user engagement and retention: # Desktop vs. Mobile - **User Behavior and Preferences**: Users on desktop may engage more deeply with content or services that require intensive interaction or a larger screen (e.g., complex applications, in-depth reading), while mobile users often seek quick, on-the-go interactions. This affects session lengths, frequency, and the type of content or features that are popular on each platform. - **Accessibility and Context**: Mobile devices allow for more spontaneous and frequent use since they're constantly accessible, boosting potential DAU. Conversely, desktop usage might be more deliberate and possibly confined to work hours or specific use cases, which could impact when and how users engage. - **Technical Performance**: Mobile apps may face challenges like varying device capabilities, screen sizes, and network speeds, potentially affecting user experience more diversely than on the relatively standardized desktop environment. Poor performance on one type of device can significantly impact user engagement metrics. # Android vs. iOS - **Demographics and User Bases**: The user demographics for Android vs. iOS can differ substantially across regions, socioeconomic statuses, and other factors. As such, preferences in app functionalities, content, and usability may shift between platforms, impacting DAU/MAU. - **Market Fragmentation**: Android's market is more fragmented with more device manufacturers, models, and OS versions. Ensuring consistent app performance across numerous Android devices is challenging, potentially affecting user satisfaction and retention. - **Monetization and Spending Habits**: iOS users are often reported to have higher spending habits within apps compared to Android users. If revenue or monetization per user is linked to your engagement strategy or content updates (which affects DAU/MAU), this is a crucial distinction. - **Platform Policies and Updates**: Both Android and iOS have their unique app store guidelines, review processes, and update cycles, which can influence app development strategies, feature rollouts, and, consequently, user engagement. # Evaluating the Impact To evaluate and adapt to the impacts of operating platforms, consider the following strategies: - **Segmented Analysis**: Conduct segmented analysis of engagement metrics (DAU, MAU, session length, retention, etc.) by platform. This helps identify platform-specific trends or issues. - **Platform-Specific Features**: Consider developing features or content tailored to the strengths and user preferences of each platform. For instance, leveraging rich notifications on mobile or advanced graphics capabilities on desktop. - **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor and optimize app performance across all platforms, focusing on aspects like load times, responsiveness, and crash rates. The goal is to provide a seamless and positive user experience everywhere. - **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze platform-specific user feedback through app reviews, surveys, and in-app feedback mechanisms to understand user needs and pain points. By closely monitoring how each platform influences DAU and MAU and by adapting your strategy to these nuances, you can better cater to your user base, improve engagement, and potentially reverse declines in these crucial metrics."},{"prompt":"Write SQL query, For a log table, find the number of times each user has signed in a day, how many messages have been sent, the first sign in date, how many messages have been sent since the first sign in date, and whether they are active today","completion":"To formulate an SQL query that addresses this request, it's important to make some assumptions about the structure of the log table(s) involved because the specific schema was not provided. Assuming we have at least two tables: one logging user sign-ins and another tracking messages sent by users. Let's say the tables have the following structures: 1. **\`user_signins\`** table: - \`user_id\` (user's unique identifier) - \`signin_time\` (timestamp of when the user signed in) 2. **\`user_messages\`** table: - \`user_id\` (user's unique identifier) - \`message_time\` (timestamp of when the message was sent) Given these structures, the following SQL query would meet the requirements: \`\`\`sql WITH FirstSignIn AS ( SELECT user_id, MIN(signin_time) AS first_signin_date FROM user_signins GROUP BY user_id ), SignInCounts AS ( SELECT user_id, DATE(signin_time) AS signin_day, COUNT(*) AS signins_per_day, MAX(signin_time) AS last_signin_time FROM user_signins GROUP BY user_id, DATE(signin_time) ), MessageCounts AS ( SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS messages_sent FROM user_messages GROUP BY user_id ), MessagesSinceFirstSignIn AS ( SELECT m.user_id, COUNT(*) AS messages_since_first_signin FROM user_messages m JOIN FirstSignIn f ON m.user_id = f.user_id WHERE m.message_time >= f.first_signin_date GROUP BY m.user_id ), ActivityToday AS ( SELECT user_id, CASE WHEN DATE(last_signin_time) = CURRENT_DATE THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS active_today FROM SignInCounts ) SELECT f.user_id, IFNULL(s.signins_per_day, 0) AS signins_today, IFNULL(mc.messages_sent, 0) AS total_messages_sent, f.first_signin_date, IFNULL(msi.messages_since_first_signin, 0) AS messages_since_first_signin, IFNULL(a.active_today, 'No') AS active_today FROM FirstSignIn f LEFT JOIN SignInCounts s ON f.user_id = s.user_id AND s.signin_day = CURRENT_DATE LEFT JOIN MessageCounts mc ON f.user_id = mc.user_id LEFT JOIN MessagesSinceFirstSignIn msi ON f.user_id = msi.user_id LEFT JOIN ActivityToday a ON f.user_id = a.user_id GROUP BY f.user_id ORDER BY f.user_id; \`\`\` This query constructs the solution using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and manageability. It makes the following assumptions: - The \`signin_time\` and \`message_time\` are stored as datetime/timestamp data types. - \`CURRENT_DATE\` returns today's date in the database system you're using. This function might differ depending on the SQL dialect (e.g., \`GETDATE()\` in MS SQL Server). - Adjustments may be necessary if your schema, SQL dialect, or requirements differ. For instance, if you want a total count of messages sent per day, you would need to adjust the \`MessageCounts\` CTE and join it similarly to \`SignInCounts\`, partitioned by day. Additionally, note how LEFT JOINS are used to ensure all users are included in the final result, even if they have no sign-ins or messages in certain categories. Depending on your exact requirements and database schema, further adjustments might be needed."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

Sungguk, I'll leave the address. - Sungguk, there's a new restaurant opening this week, they have a 1 dollar dinner buffet for one day only. Everyone was leaving comments to help with my challenge. [Ah, I'm hungry... I should just study.] Dennis looked at me with worried eyes. \\"Sungguk, you're at the age of growing... Aren't you losing too much weight?\\" \\"Ah! That's what I should buy.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Protein shake. Why didn't I think of that?\\" I quickly searched Amazon for the cheapest and most abundant protein shake. Including shipping, 9.99 dollars! I quickly captured the screen and posted it on 'Face Paper'. - Bought a protein shake for 10 dollars. Including shipping, 9.99 dollars, what a majestic price. The comments were filled with words of wise choice, and many also warned that I might throw up from drinking it. Dennis shook his head. \\"Sungguk, you're really unstoppable.\\" \\"Dennis, how's the screenplay going?\\" \\"Going to classes, doing assignments... I'm so busy going to parties, I haven't made any progress. Maybe I'll get some inspiration after going to New York.\\" \\"Dennis, just wait a bit. Peter will definitely invite us to New York in a month.\\" \\"Sungguk, how can you be so confident in everything?\\" [How? I'm a former tycoon. I know the mindset of people who invest in companies better than anyone.] I just smiled. \\"Dennis, I'll talk less until the protein shake arrives. Talking makes me hungry.\\" \\"Got it.\\" Then, a call came from an unknown number. [Should I answer it? I'm hungry...] After hesitating, I answered the call. \\"Hello?\\" - Is this the Harvard student conducting the 30 dollars for 30 days project on 'Face Paper'? \\"Yes, that's me. Who is this?\\" - I'm a writer for the 'Ellen Winfrey Show'. I've been following 'Face Paper'... Would you be available for an interview? The Ellen Winfrey Show? I jumped up from my seat. The Ellen Winfrey Show was the nation's top-rated talk show broadcast across the United States. Of course, I exclaimed. \\"Absolutely!\\" * Mark was pacing back and forth in the dorm room with an excited face. \\"Sungguk, are you really going on the Ellen Winfrey Show?\\" \\"It's a small segment introducing this week's issue, but they're coming directly to Harvard for the interview.\\" \\"Wow, amazing. My mom and dad watch that show too. Can I loiter behind you?\\" \\"Prepare to come out, Mark and Dennis. When I asked if my friends could come out too, they said it would be better to have friends testify, so I recommended you two.\\" Mark and Dennis high-fived. \\"Mark, let's go buy clothes.\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"Sungguk, what will you wear?\\" \\"I spent all my money on the protein shake, so I have no money left. I'll just wear what I have, whatever.\\" For the record, I had already set in my mind what I would wear. Jeans with a gray hoodie and sneakers. If Charlie Jobs had his black turtleneck, I would have my hoodie. \\"Mark, should we go to the salon and get our hair done?\\" \\"We should ask 'Face Paper'. Where's a good and cheap salon around here?\\" Mark quickly posted on 'Face Paper'. Soon comments were posted, and Mark and Dennis left the dorm room laughing, saying they were going to get their hair done. I mixed a few spoons of protein shake with water and shook it. And drank it earnestly. [Really, this taste is... like the water left after washing dishes. Ugh-.] * \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'm a writer for the Ellen Winfrey Show, handling this week's issue.\\" \\"Hello.\\" I deliberately bowed slightly in the Korean way to greet her. \\"Oh, are you Korean?\\" \\"How did you know?\\" \\"My mom is Korean. She taught me to greet like that since I was little.\\" \\"Thank you for recognizing it.\\" Michelle Jona was a cheerful person. Before turning on the camera for the direct interview, a pre-interview was conducted. Michelle Jona asked me a question. \\"But what people are most curious about is why you started this project. Everyone seems curious about why a Harvard student is doing a project to spend 1 dollar a day, 30 dollars a month.\\" \\"I'm planning to start a business soon. It might be good to get a good job after graduating from Harvard, but I want to take as many challenges as possible while I'm young.\\" \\"Oh my, but is it true that you entered Harvard at twelve?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Michelle Jona knew quite a bit about me. \\"But why are you doing the 30 dollars for 30 days project specifically for starting a business?\\" \\"Starting a business is quite risky, you know. I imagined what it would be like if I failed in business, lost my wealth, and everyone turned their backs on me. Thinking about that, I decided to live like this for a month.\\" \\"Imagining the worst-case scenario?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"By the way, you keep posting this process on 'Face Paper'. Any special reason?\\" \\"First of all, just knowing that someone is watching my project is a big encouragement for completing it. Since Harvard students know I'm doing this project, everyone becomes a watcher of this project.\\" \\"Also, you have friends to testify for you?\\" \\"Yes, this is my roommate Dennis Shazel, and this is Mark Zuckerberg. We created 'Face Paper' together.\\" I introduced Mark to Michelle Jona. Michelle Jona asked Mark and Dennis if my project was successful. \\"So far, yes. He's really been surviving on hotdogs, oranges, and the protein shake he bought a few days ago.\\" Dennis testified faithfully. \\"Sungguk, so you're planning to start a business with 'Face Paper'?\\" \\"Yes, Mark and I are preparing for it.\\" I answered confidently. * * Mark, Dennis, and I all gathered in the dorm room, waiting for the Ellen Winfrey Show to start. We even skipped classes for this. \\"Sungguk, did we come out well?\\" \\"Let's see, Dennis.\\" Mark looked at me with a serious face. \\"Sungguk, but I'm really curious... You're going on TV to expose 'Face Paper', right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Peter Branton is already interested, but was it necessary to go on TV?\\" \\"Mark, although Peter Branton is indeed the god of investment, if our popularity rises, we can attract investment under more favorable conditions.\\" \\"Really, do you have Warren Buffett living inside you?\\" \\"Maybe...\\" I shrugged. [You little ones, you have no idea who I am.] The show started soon. The weekly hot issue corner was a short segment aired during the break of the talk show in the studio. Ellen Winfrey introduced the segment after conducting a long interview with a famous actor. \\"Today, we met with Harvard student Sungguk Jeon, who is conducting a project to live on 1 dollar a day, 30 dollars a month on 'Face Paper', an SNS mainly used by Harvard students. And more surprisingly, Sungguk Jeon is a genius who entered Harvard at the age of twelve.\\" My interview footage was shown simultaneously. \\"Sungguk, I'm caught standing behind you! Dennis, I think we really chose the right place to get our hair done.\\" Mark started to chatter excitedly. The interview went out without much distortion, and simultaneously, 'Face Paper' crashed due to an overload of access."},{"prompt":"나와 데니스는 피터와의 약속 장소로 터덜터덜 걸어갔다. 인터뷰를 마친 데니스의 얼굴에는 아련한 그리움 같은 게 어려 있었다. “데니스, 드럼 포기한 거 후회하지 않아?” “가끔 후회해. 그때 그 선생님의 말에 상처받지 말고 내 실력을 더 갈고닦았으면 어땠을까. 그런 생각 하거든.” “데니스, 영화의 주인공이 그런 성격이면 어떨까. 왜, 채찍을 가하면 가할수록 강해지는 사람 있잖아. 독한 말을 들으면 언제고 저 사람의 말을 뛰어넘어 주겠어! 이런 독한 마음을 품는 거지. 연습도 더 열심히 하고….” “그러는 사이에 그 선생님이랑은 엄청 갈등하고?” “응. 20대 초반에 연애도 하고 다른 친구들처럼 휴가도 가고 해야 하는데, 그러는 사이에 주인공은 연애나 그 외의 것들도 모두 포기하는 거야.” “성국, 너무 재미있을 것 같은데….” 데니스의 눈빛이 또다시 반짝였다. 역시 예술가들은 달랐다. 무언가를 향해 달려갈 때 가장 빛이 났다. “나, 뉴욕은 처음인데… 정말 이곳에는 곳곳에 젊은 예술가들이 사는 것 같아. 성국, 넌 뉴욕 와봤어?” 그러고 보니 예전에 그레이스와 지내던 곳 근처였다. “필립 아카데미 들어가기 전에 이곳 숙소에서 지냈어.” [그레이스는 아직 여기 살 텐데….] 이때, 익숙한 얼굴의 한 사람이 반갑게 미소를 지으며 다가왔다. “성국이 맞아?” “그레이스!” [호랑이도 제 말 하면 온다더니… 맨해튼이 좁긴 좁지.] “성국아, 뉴욕엔 어쩐 일이야?” “뉴욕에 일이 있어서요. 여기는 제 룸메이트 데니스요.” 피터와의 약속으로 온 것이라 그레이스에게 따로 연락은 하지 않았었다. “그레이스. 안 그래도 부탁드릴 일이 있어서 연락하려고 했어요. 저 이번에 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 관련해서 계약하려고 하거든요. 효진 그룹에서 계약서 좀 검토해 주셨으면 해서요.” “그런 건 당연히 부탁해야지. 근데 어디 가는 길이야?” “아, 피터라고, 저희 대학 선배이자 투자자가 되실 분이랑 저녁 먹으러요. 그레이스도 같이 가실래요?” “내가 가도 되는 자리야?” “제가 피터한테 물어볼게요.” 나는 얼른 전화기를 꺼내서 피터에게 연락을 했다. 나를 돌봐준 선생님 같은 분이라는 말에 피터는 그레이스를 보고 싶다는 말까지 했다. “그레이스, 7시에 울프 스테이크에서 보기로 했어요. 시간 맞춰 오세요.” “알았어. 나보고 그 사람 좀 제대로 봐달라는 거지?” “그럼요.” [사실은 그레이스, 피터 좋은 사람 같아서 소개해 주려는 거야. 혼맥만큼 좋은 인맥도 없기도 하고.] 그레이스는 어서 가서 준비해야겠다며 근처 아파트로 들어갔다. 데니스가 나를 보더니 싱긋 웃었다. “성국, 이건 내 상상일 수도 있는데. 너 혹시 피터에게 그레이스 소개해 주려는 거 아니야?” 뜨끔.

[Did I make it too obvious?]"},{"prompt":"when describing a villain, why can simplistic description of them and their acts be more scary and impactful then edgy, over the top stuff?","completion":"Simplistic descriptions of villains and their actions can often be more scary and impactful than edgy, over-the-top depictions for several reasons: 1. **Relatability:** Simpler descriptions can make a villain seem more realistic, relatable, and thus, more terrifying. Villains who resemble or act in ways that remind us of what we might encounter in the real world tap into primal fears, making the threat they pose feel immediate and personal. 2. **Leaves Room for Imagination:** A minimalist description can engage the reader's or audience's imagination more effectively. When details are sparse, people fill in the gaps with their own fears and anxieties, crafting a personalized version of what's frightening to them. This can make the villain seem more menacing than any detailed description the author might provide. 3. **Focuses on the Essence:** Simplifying the description of a villain and their actions can distill their malevolence to its essence, creating a more potent symbol of evil. Complex motivations and elaborate schemes can sometimes dilute the immediate emotional impact of a villain’s presence. In contrast, a straightforward depiction of malevolence strikes directly at the audience's sense of right and wrong. 4. **Universal Fear:** Simplicity in the portrayal of villains and their acts often taps into broad, universal fears—such as death, darkness, or the unknown—rather than specific, context-bound terrors. This can make the villain feel like a more timeless and omnipresent threat. 5. **Psychological Realism:** Often, the scariest villains are those who exhibit believable psychological motivations. Over-the-top villains can sometimes seem cartoonish, making it harder for the audience to take them seriously. In contrast, a villain with simple, understandable motives—like revenge, power, or even survival—can be much more relatable and thus, more disturbing. 6. **Subtlety and Suspense:** A simplistic depiction can contribute to a more suspenseful narrative. When a villain’s malevolence is not fully explained or shown, it builds tension and anticipation, leaving audiences on edge. This suspenseful environment can heighten the fear factor, as the audience awaits the full reveal of the villain's capabilities and intentions. In storytelling, whether it be through literature, film, or any other medium, the approach to characterizing villains depends largely on the desired effect. Simplicity in villain portrayal, due to its psychological depth and potential for greater relatability, can often lead to a more profoundly unsettling experience."},{"prompt":"could over the top evil stuff for the villain accidently make them likeable, while over the top good stuff for the heroes can back them unlikeable?","completion":"Yes, the way characters are portrayed, whether villains or heroes, can significantly impact how audiences perceive and emotionally respond to them. Over-the-top elements, whether in villainy or heroism, can have counterintuitive effects, making villains more likeable and heroes less so. Here's how this can happen: # Over-the-Top Villains Becoming Likable: 1. **Charm and Charisma:** Villains portrayed with excessive evil or grandiosity often exhibit a certain charm or charisma. This larger-than-life portrayal can make them fascinating to the audience, who may find themselves drawn to the villain's confidence, wit, or sheer audacity. 2. **Complexity and Depth:** When a villain's plans and machinations are grandiose and elaborate, it can suggest a deep, albeit twisted, intelligence. This complexity can make the villain more interesting and engaging compared to a more straightforward antagonist. 3. **Underdog Appeal:** In scenarios where villains face overwhelmingly good heroes, their over-the-top nature might position them as underdogs. Audiences often have a soft spot for underdog figures, finding their resilience in the face of defeat to be compelling. 4. **Entertainment Value:** Villains who engage in over-the-top evil acts often bring a level of entertainment and spectacle to the story that can be thrilling to watch. This entertainment factor can endear the villain to the audience, even if their actions are morally reprehensible. # Over-the-Top Heroes Becoming Unlikable: 1. **Lack of Relatability:** Heroes who are too perfect or whose actions are impossibly noble can seem unrealistic and difficult to relate to. This lack of relatability can make them seem distant or aloof, reducing audience empathy. 2. **Moral Superiority:** Heroes who always do the right thing, to an over-the-top degree, can come across as sanctimonious or self-righteous. This perceived moral superiority can be off-putting, making the heroes less likable. 3. **Absence of Struggle:** If heroes effortlessly overcome every obstacle thanks to their over-the-top goodness or abilities, it removes the sense of struggle and development. Audiences often connect with characters through their vulnerabilities and growth, so the absence of these elements can make heroes seem flat and unengaging. 4. **Predictability:** Over-the-top goodness can lead to predictable storytelling, where the outcome of the hero’s quest is never really in doubt. This lack of suspense and challenge can make the heroes less interesting to the audience. In both cases, the effectiveness of character portrayal hinges on complexity, relatability, and balance. Characters—villainous or heroic—who exhibit depth, face genuine challenges, and evoke empathy tend to resonate more deeply with audiences. Over-the-top characteristics, when not balanced by these elements, can lead to unintended perceptions and reactions from the audience."},{"prompt":"so for a villain to be truly disliked, or hated, subtlety is key?","completion":"Yes, subtlety can be a critical factor in creating a truly disliked or hated villain in storytelling. Here's why subtle nuances in villain characterization can lead to more profound audience antipathy: 1. **Realism and Relatability:** Subtle villains can appear more realistic and relatable. By exhibiting behaviors, motivations, and flaws that are recognizably human, these characters remind us of the darkness that can exist within ourselves or those we know. This mirroring of real-world evil can elicit a stronger emotional response from the audience. 2. **Psychological Depth:** Subtlety allows for psychological depth, making a villain's motives, backstory, and actions more complex and nuanced. A villain who isn't just evil for the sake of being evil, but has believable motivations and perhaps even moments of vulnerability or humanity, can provoke a deeper sense of unease. This complexity makes their actions feel more insidious and their presence more menacing because it's harder to dismiss them as purely fictional constructs. 3. **Unpredictability:** Subtle villains can be more unpredictable. Without grandiose schemes or overtly evil acts broadcasted from the start, it's harder for audiences to anticipate the villain's next move. This unpredictability keeps audiences engaged and on edge, amplifying their emotional response to the villain. 4. **Moral Ambiguity:** Subtlety often introduces moral ambiguity, presenting actions and decisions that aren't clearly right or wrong but fall into a grey area. When audiences can't easily categorize a villain as purely evil, it challenges their moral compass, creating discomfort and sometimes even sympathy, which can then turn into dislike when the villain's actions are finally revealed to be reprehensible. This complex emotional journey can make the villain more memorable and despised. 5. **Integration with the Protagonist's Journey:** A subtle villain often intertwines closely with the protagonist's journey, challenging them in ways that are personal and meaningful. Instead of merely presenting an external obstacle to be overcome, a subtle villain can represent the protagonist's fears, doubts, or flaws externalized. This makes the villain's eventual defeat more satisfying but their actions and manipulations until that point more detestable. While subtlety can enhance a villain's impact, it's important to note that there isn't one universally correct approach to creating disliked or hated villains. The effectiveness of subtlety, like any storytelling technique, depends on various factors such as genre, narrative style, and the themes being explored. However, in general, subtlety in villain characterization allows for more sophisticated storytelling, which can lead to a richer, more emotionally engaging experience for the audience."},{"prompt":"so subtle and flawed heroes can make viewers/readers go 'That could be me!' whilst a villain as discussed in this output can also make them go 'That could be me...'.","completion":"Exactly. The subtlety and complexity in the portrayal of both heroes and villains can evoke a sense of identification from the audience, albeit in distinct and nuanced ways. This identification plays a crucial role in how the audience emotionally engages with the narrative. # For Heroes: Subtle, flawed heroes resonate with viewers and readers because they reflect the imperfect human experience. These characters often face moral dilemmas, make mistakes, and struggle with weaknesses, mirroring the challenges that real people confront. This authenticity makes heroes more relatable and compelling, encouraging the audience to root for them. When viewers or readers see heroes who aren't invincible or infallible but are trying their best despite their flaws, they can think, \\"That could be me!\\" This connection not only makes the story more engaging but also more inspiring, as it suggests that heroism is not about perfection but about making courageous choices in the face of adversity. # For Villains: On the villain side, a subtle and nuanced portrayal can similarly provoke a thought of, \\"That could be me...\\" This realization, however, is often accompanied by discomfort or even fear. When villains have believable motivations, show signs of vulnerability, or exhibit human flaws, it blurs the line between good and evil. It prompts the audience to recognize that under certain circumstances, anyone might be capable of wrongdoing. This introspection can be unsettling but also deeply engaging, as it challenges viewers and readers to reflect on the darker aspects of the human condition and the choices that lead individuals down various paths. This nuanced approach to character development enhances the narrative depth and emotional impact of the story. It encourages the audience to engage in a more personal and reflective manner, considering their own potential for both heroism and wrongdoing. By presenting characters that audience members can see themselves in—whether aspiring to be like the heroes or being wary of resembling the villains—stories can achieve a more profound level of engagement and leave a lasting impression on their audience. The power of storytelling, in part, lies in its ability to hold up a mirror to humanity, allowing individuals to explore the complexities of human nature from the safety of fictional worlds. Through characters that offer shades of both light and dark, stories invite introspection and understanding, making the narrative journey not just one of entertainment, but also one of personal relevance."},{"prompt":"could it also be compelling if the hero truly wins against the villain when they accept their own flaws, that they don't have to be perfect and right all the time to be seen as a hero?","completion":"Absolutely, a hero’s acceptance of their own flaws and the understanding that they don't need to be perfect or right all the time to be heroic can be a profoundly compelling and powerful narrative moment. This realization often marks a significant point in the hero’s journey, contributing to their character development and enhancing the story's thematic depth. Here are several reasons why this aspect can be particularly compelling: 1. **Humanizing the Hero:** When heroes recognize and accept their imperfections, it humanizes them. It shows that, like everyone else, they are works in progress, struggling with their own doubts, mistakes, and shortcomings. This vulnerability makes them more relatable and realistic, strengthening the emotional bond between the characters and the audience. 2. **Highlighting Growth:** The acceptance of imperfection often signifies a hero's personal growth and emotional maturity. It's a realization that true strength comes from acknowledging one's vulnerabilities and learning from them. This journey towards self-acceptance and growth can be inspiring for the audience, reflecting the value of personal development in real life. 3. **Redefining Heroism:** Such a narrative challenges traditional notions of heroism that often emphasize invincibility and moral infallibility. By showing that heroes can make mistakes and have flaws, the story redefines heroism to include resilience, the ability to adapt and learn, and the courage to face one's own weaknesses. This more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a hero can resonate deeply with viewers and readers, offering a more inclusive and attainable model of heroism. 4. **Enhancing the Victory:** A hero's triumph over a villain becomes more meaningful when it’s achieved through self-acknowledgment and growth, rather than sheer physical strength or tactical superiority. It suggests that the real battle was not only against the external threat but also within the hero’s own psyche. The victory, therefore, feels earned and signifies the overcoming of personal barriers as much as external ones, making the narrative resolution more satisfying. 5. **Offering a Universal Message:** The theme of accepting one's flaws and the understanding that nobody needs to be perfect is universally resonant. It reflects a fundamental aspect of the human condition: the ongoing struggle with self-doubt and the quest for self-acceptance. By embedding this message within the context of a hero's victory, the story delivers a powerful and uplifting lesson about the value of self-compassion and the importance of embracing one's true self. In sum, when heroes come to terms with their flaws and realize that perfection is neither attainable nor necessary for heroism, it enriches the story and its characters, making the narrative more engaging, relatable, and ultimately more rewarding for the audience. This acknowledgment of vulnerability and imperfection contributes to a more authentic portrayal of heroism, one that celebrates human resilience and the capacity for growth and change."},{"prompt":"How would a protagonist that fights the villain whenever he can, even when he doesn't need to, be perceived, vs a protagonist that does something like knocking the Villain down a hill, than taking the time gained to do what he is actually there for, like obtaining an important object or saving someone?","completion":"The perception of a protagonist in a narrative heavily depends on their actions, motivations, and the consequences of those actions. How a protagonist interacts with the antagonist or villain can significantly shape the audience's view of the character, influencing whether they are seen as a hero, an antihero, or something in between. Let's contrast the two scenarios you've described to explore how each might be perceived: # The Ever-Fighting Protagonist A protagonist who fights the villain at every opportunity, even when it's unnecessary, could be perceived in several ways, depending on the context and execution: - **Admirably Determined or Obsessed**: The audience might see this protagonist as someone with a strong resolve and dedication to stopping evil at all costs. However, this dogged pursuit could also be perceived as an obsession, potentially leading the protagonist to neglect other responsibilities or ethical considerations. - **Heroic or Reckless**: Constantly engaging with the villain could be seen as brave, showcasing the protagonist's willingness to confront danger. Alternatively, if these confrontations lead to unnecessary risks or harm, the protagonist might be viewed as reckless or lacking in foresight. - **Moral Integrity or Vengeance-Driven**: If the protagonist's unyielding stance against the villain stems from a deep-seated moral code or a desire to protect others, they could be admired for their integrity. Conversely, if their actions are motivated by personal vendetta, they might be seen as being driven by vengeance, complicating their heroic status. # The Strategic Protagonist A protagonist who opts for a strategic approach, like incapacitating the villain temporarily to achieve a vital goal, could also be perceived in various ways: - **Pragmatic and Focused**: This protagonist might be seen as someone who prioritizes their objectives and can make quick, effective decisions under pressure. Their ability to focus on the bigger picture and not get sidetracked by personal vendettas might be viewed positively. - **Clever and Resourceful**: Choosing to momentarily disable the villain to gain time for a crucial task demonstrates cleverness and resourcefulness. This approach suggests that the protagonist is strategic in their thinking, utilizing their environment and situation to their advantage. - **Morally Ambiguous or Compassionate**: Depending on how the protagonist handles the situation, they might be seen as morally ambiguous, particularly if their methods seem unorthodox or if there's collateral damage. However, if their actions clearly aim to minimize overall harm and achieve a greater good, the protagonist might also be viewed as compassionate and wise. In both scenarios, the narrative context, the protagonist's motivations, and the outcomes of their actions play crucial roles in shaping audience perception. The ever-fighting protagonist could be admired for their bravery but critiqued for potential recklessness, while the strategic protagonist might be praised for their pragmatism but questioned on moral grounds depending on their methods. Ultimately, the complexity and relatability of the protagonist's character arc, combined with the narrative's moral landscape, determine how these actions resonate with the audience."},{"prompt":"could the first example be seen as vain as well, having a hero complex?","completion":"Yes, the first example of a protagonist who consistently fights the villain, even when not necessary, can indeed be perceived as exhibiting a hero complex, and potentially even vanity, in certain narrative contexts. Here’s how these perceptions might develop: # Hero Complex A hero complex describes a person's compulsive need to act the savior or to engage in heroic actions even when such interventions are unwarranted or unwanted. In the narrative of a protagonist who seeks out conflict with the villain at every opportunity, regardless of necessity, audiences might interpret this behavior as evidence of a hero complex. This complex might stem from a deep-seated need for validation, the desire for constant recognition, or an obsession with self-image as the unwavering hero. Such motivations can make the character appear as though they prioritize their own self-concept of being a hero over more pragmatic or morally nuanced approaches to solving problems. # Vanity Vanity, in this context, would be the protagonist's excessive pride in or preoccupation with their own abilities, appearance, or heroism. If a character repeatedly engages in battles with the antagonist more out of a desire to be seen as the hero, to bask in admiration, or to maintain a certain image, rather than from a place of genuine altruism or strategic necessity, their actions could be interpreted as vain. This portrayal might suggest that the protagonist values their heroic status and the applause that comes with it above the actual welfare of others or the achievement of their overarching goals. # Narrative Implications When a protagonist displays a hero complex or vanity, it introduces moral and psychological complexity to the character and the narrative. While these traits can add depth, they also raise questions about the nature of heroism and the protagonist's true motivations. Audiences may find such a character intriguing but also flawed, as their actions might lead to unnecessary conflict, put others at risk, or stem from less noble intentions than initially believed. A skillfully written narrative might use these traits to foster character development, placing the protagonist in situations where they must confront and overcome these tendencies. Ultimately, recognizing their vulnerabilities and growing beyond a simplistic need for validation or adulation can lead to a more mature form of heroism—one marked by self-awareness, humility, and a genuine commitment to the greater good. The nuanced portrayal of such a protagonist can resonate deeply with audiences, offering a more complex and humanized vision of what it means to be a hero, beyond the simplistic dichotomy of \\"good\\" versus \\"evil.\\""},{"prompt":"could it also be realistic and understandable for the protagonist that knocks the villain down a hill to gain time struggles with not going after him?","completion":"Yes, it would be entirely realistic and understandable for a protagonist who opts for a strategic approach—such as knocking the villain down a hill to gain time—to struggle with the decision not to pursue them further. This internal conflict can enrich the character's depth and make for a compelling narrative for several reasons: # Moral and Emotional Conflict The protagonist's struggle can stem from a deep sense of morality or justice. They may feel that allowing the villain to potentially escape or regain strength could lead to future harm, making them question whether they've made the right choice. This moral quandary can create significant emotional tension, as the protagonist weighs the immediate necessity of their primary objective against the broader implications of their decision. # Duty and Responsibility A protagonist, especially one positioned as a guardian or protector, might feel a strong sense of duty to stop the villain at all costs. The decision to prioritize a different objective, even if logically sound, could conflict with their sense of responsibility to prevent evil deeds. This duty-bound perspective can cause the protagonist to doubt their actions, wondering if they've forsaken their responsibility for a temporary advantage. # Personal Vendetta If the protagonist has a personal history with the villain, the choice not to pursue them further might be particularly agonizing. Driven by a desire for justice or revenge, the protagonist could struggle with the notion that they've missed an opportunity to settle a personal score or bring about long-awaited closure. This internal battle between personal emotions and the greater good adds another layer of complexity to the character's motivations and decisions. # Fear of Judgment The protagonist might also worry about how their actions (or inaction) will be perceived by others. If they're part of a team or community, there might be an underlying fear that their decision could be seen as cowardice or a failure to protect. This concern for their reputation and the trust placed in them by others can amplify their internal struggle. # The Human Element At the heart of this internal conflict is the profoundly human experience of doubt and indecision. The protagonist's struggle reflects the complexities of making difficult choices under pressure, where the consequences are significant, and the outcomes uncertain. This relatability is what makes the character's experience so compelling and understandable to readers or viewers. By incorporating this internal conflict into the story, the narrative can explore themes of sacrifice, responsibility, and the nuanced nature of heroism. It allows the audience to delve deeper into the protagonist's psyche, fostering empathy and engagement. Moreover, the protagonist's eventual resolution of this conflict, whether through reflection, advice from allies, or the unfolding of events, can serve as a pivotal moment of character development and advance the story in meaningful ways."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[평생 핫도그는 입에도 대지 말아야지.] 그래도 꾸역꾸역 핫도그를 입으로 밀어 넣었다. 데니스는 맛있게 핫도그를 먹었다. “성국, 네 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에서 다들 지금 축제 분위기야. 카운트다운을 하고 있어. 이제 곧 자정이니까, 네 도전도 끝나는 거지?” “응….” 나는 마지막 핫도그의 나무 막대기를 쓰레기통에 휙 던져버렸다. [이제 정말 끝이다!] 동시에 똑. 똑. 노크 소리가 들렸다. “누구세요?” 데니스의 말이 끝나기도 전에 문이 벌컥 열리면서 마크와 제시가 피자와 각종 음식을 들고 방 안으로 쳐들어왔다. 뒤로 미셸 조나와 카메라도 보였다. “성국, 그날 방송이 워낙 이슈가 돼서 내가 급하게 연락도 없이 왔어. 미안.” “괜찮아요.” 미셸 조나는 급하게 간단한 멘트도 땄다. “오늘은 전성국 군의 30달러로 한 달 살기 프로젝트가 끝나는 날인데요. 벌써 하버드 기숙사는 축제 분위기입니다. 친구들이 프로젝트 끝나는 기념으로 피자와 각종 음식까지 사서 들고 왔네요.” 주변의 기숙사 친구들도 내 방 주위로 모여들었다. 모두들 다 같이 내 프로젝트의 마지막을 같이 해주고 있었다. “자, 성국. 이제 1분도 채 안 남았어요. 우리 다 같이 카운트다운 해요.” 미셸 조나의 말에 모두들 동의했다. 나는 학생들 사이에 서서 카운트다운을 함께 했다. “10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! 축하해요!” 미셸 조나가 마이크를 들이밀었다. “성국, 지금 제일 먹고 싶은 게 뭐예요?” “저희 아버지가 만든 보쌈이요.” “한국 음식이군요.” “네.” “아쉽게도, 여기서 지금 보쌈은 구하기 힘들 것 같은데, 그럼 이 중에서 가장 먹고 싶은 건 뭐예요?” “당연히!” 나는 당장 잘 튀겨진 닭다리를 집었다. “치킨이죠!” 그러곤 한 입 크게 깨물었다. 동시에 친구들은 다시 한번 크게 환호했다. * * * 기숙사 방 안은 파티의 장으로 변했다. 미셸 조나도 파티에 끼어서 같이 음식을 먹고 즐겼다. “성국, 방송 나가고 게시판도 난리였어. 너에 대해서 궁금해하는 사람들도 많았고, 도대체 저런 천재성을 가진 아이가 어쩜 저렇게 잘생기기까지 한 거냐고 난리도 아니었어.” “방송 잘 내보내 주셔서 감사해요.” 나는 음식을 닥치는 대로 먹고 있었다. 한 달 동안 의도치 않게 절식을 해서인지 살도 많이 빠졌고, 덕분에 카메라는 더 잘 받았다. 마크가 다가와서 내가 제일 좋아하는 햄버거를 내밀었다. “성국, 너 최애 버거. 내가 이거 구하려고 차까지 빌려서 다녀왔어.” 역시 오랜 친구는 달랐다. “마크, 진짜 고마워.” 이때, 핸드폰이 요란하게 울렸다. 나는 누가 전화를 한 것인지 알 것 같았다. 예상대로 발신자 표시에 피터 브랜튼이 떴다. 나는 핸드폰을 들고 조용한 구석으로 향했다. 구석으로 걸어가는 내내 동기들은 축하 인사를 건넸다. 겨우 구석에 자리 잡은 나는 전화를 받았다. - 성국, 축하해! 막 ‘페이스 페이퍼’로 결과 확인했어. “감사해요.” - 성국, 다음 주 주말에 마크랑 뉴욕에 올 수 있지? 비행기표와 호텔까지 내가 모든 것을 제공할게. 아, 그 룸메이트 친구도 함께. “아무 대가 없는 거죠?” - 당연하지. “다음 주에 뉴욕에서 봬요.” 나는 흔쾌히 뉴욕행을 선택했다. * * * 해가 밝아오는 것을 보고 동기들은 기숙사를 떠났다. 마크와 데니스도 졸린 기색이 역력했다. 나는 얼른 마크와 데니스를 쳐다봤다. “참, 우리 다음 주에 다 같이 뉴욕 갈 거야. 피터가 비행기랑 호텔 다 예약해준대.” “나도?” 데니스가 물었다. “응. 피터가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 가입할 때 도움 줘서 고마웠대. 내가 너, 뉴욕에 있는 예술 학교 배경으로 시나리오 쓴다고 말했었거든. 한번 가서 보는 게 좋지 않겠어?” “대박! 성국. 정말 믿기지가 않아. 너랑 있으면 모든 게 이뤄지는 느낌이야.” [당연하지, 나 전성국이야.] 나는 최대한 겸손하게 어깨를 으쓱했다. “마크, 우리는 피터와 어떤 식으로 사업을 추진할지에 대해서 조금 준비하자.” “성국, 진짜 우리 이걸로 창업하는 거야?” “마크, 난 내가 너에게 이 아이디어를 말했던 그 순간부터 이렇게 할 생각이었어.” 마크는 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “그래, 가보자. 지금 아니면 이런 도전 또 언제 해보겠어.” [물론 그 결과는 창대할 것이야, 마크. 나만 믿어.] 나는 승리에 차서 미소를 지었다. * * * “지금 우리 퍼스트 클래스에 타고 있는 거 맞지?” 마크와 데니스는 눈이 휘둥그레졌다. [촌스럽게 왜 이래.] 나야 저번 생부터 시작해서 이번 생에도 주구장창 퍼스트 클래스를 운 좋게 탔다. 마크가 나를 흘깃 쳐다봤다. “성국, 피터가 엄청 우리를 높게 평가하고 있단 의미지?” [어쭈, 나랑 좀 붙어 있더니 이제 제법 상황 판단도 하네, 마크?] 나는 작게 고개를 끄덕였다. “그런 거 같아. 뭐든 우리가 유리하게 끌어갈 수 있을 거야. ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 지금 하버드를 보내고 싶어 하는 미국의 열성 엄마들 사이에서도 엄청 유명해졌대.” “엘렌 윈프리 쇼 덕분이네.” “응.” 미국에서 시청률 1위를 달리는 엘렌 윈프리 쇼의 영향력을 막 실감하는 중이었다. 미셸 조나를 통해서 알게 되었는데 이미 여러 곳에서 투자 제의를 위해 방송국까지 연락을 하거나, 학교로도 연락이 왔다. 하지만 내가 원하는 것은 증명된 안정적인 투자였다. 데니스는 그사이 찾아본 뉴욕의 예술 학교 몇 곳 중 한 곳을 방문하기로 약속을 잡아둔 상황이었다. “성국, 너도 같이 가면 좋을 텐데. 시간이 될까?” “약속이 언제인데?” “내일 저녁에 들렀다가 학생들 몇 인터뷰하기로 했어.” “피터랑은 점심 먹으니까, 끝나고 바로 가도 될까?” “그렇게 알고 있을게.” 곧 비행기가 이륙했다. 나는 길게 하품을 하고 잠으로 빠져들었다. 비행기는 점점 고도를 향해 올라갔다. 지금 내 인생이 딱 그랬다. 고도를 향해서 마지막 힘을 내고 있었다.","completion":"Episode 107 Peter had just received a report from Miranda in New York. \\"Peter, that kid Jeon Seong-guk's 30-day project appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\\" \\"What?\\" Peter was a bit surprised. \\"It was a small segment called 'This Week's Hot Issue,' and the segment's writer used 'Face Paper.' They found Seong-guk's project interesting and sent out an interview, and thanks to that, the number of users trying to access 'Face Paper' increased, causing the server to crash. It's been restored now.\\" \\"It appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show?\\" \\"Yes. I'll let you know the rerun schedule. You should check it out.\\" \\"Ah, thanks, Miranda.\\" After Miranda left, Peter smiled ambiguously. The most concerning thing was that 'Face Paper' had become too famous, more than he had thought. Of course, it also served as an opportunity to confirm the potential he believed in. The future of 'Face Paper' was undoubtedly bright. * * * \\"Seong-guk, I watched the broadcast. You gave an interesting interview.\\" I was currently listening to Michael Sandel's lecture on \\"What is Justice?\\" which would become world-famous in ten years. It seemed that even the balding Michael Sandel had seen my interview. Everyone's attention was focused on me. Mark, Dennis, and Jessie, who were attending the same lecture, looked at me proudly. \\"Seong-guk, I really enjoyed your interview. But I have a bit of a question about 'Face Paper' you created. Imagine if I were a man stalking a female student sitting in front of me.\\" [This is getting interesting, Michael.] I quietly waited for Michael Sandel's next words. \\"'Face Paper' also has a feature that shows my current location, right? Am I correct?\\" \\"Yes, professor.\\" \\"Then, if I just posted my location on 'Face Paper' for communication with friends, what happens if a stalker checks that location and comes to find me?\\" Michael Sandel's question began. This was his unique style of engaging lecture. I took a deep breath and posed a question to Michael Sandel. \\"What about the opposite case, professor? Imagine if a child ran away from home or was kidnapped. How important could it be to share one's location, possibly serving as a clue to solve the crime?\\" \\"Are you talking about the dual nature of a single action?\\" \\"Yes, airplanes allow us to travel around the world, but they can also carry bombs in times of war. Air conditioners and refrigerators saved us from the heat, but they're also contributing to the destruction of nature and the reduction of life on Earth. Every invention and new challenge has its dual nature.\\" \\"Hmm... That's an interesting story.\\" \\"Professor, every innovation can be misused. But if we were afraid of that, how could the world have progressed? Stalking was already a concern before the use of 'Face Paper.' I believe our role is to create as much of a safeguard as possible.\\" \\"What kind of safeguards could you suggest?\\" \\"Limiting visibility of one's location to just friends, or allowing only certain people to see it. Gradually creating necessary safeguards.\\" Michael Sandel nodded. \\"I hope such features will indeed help the positive functions of 'Face Paper.' That's all for today's class.\\" After class, Michael Sandel approached me. \\"Seong-guk, I find your development very interesting. Your challenge with 'Face Paper' is fascinating too. I can join, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"I look forward to it.\\" Michael Sandel greeted and left the classroom. Jessie looked at me and gave a thumbs up. \\"Seong-guk, you did really well on the broadcast. My friends are going crazy asking me to introduce you.\\" \\"Tell them my age too. I'm still a minor.\\" [It's convenient to be a minor at times like this.] I grabbed my heavy bag. \\"Seong-guk, I'll buy you lunch today. Let's go together.\\" \\"Jessie, sorry. I decided to refuse all favors for 30 days. Now that my challenge has become too famous, if I eat with you, it'll immediately go up on 'Face Paper.'\\" \\"I was short-sighted. Once you succeed in your challenge, you're eating with me, got it?\\" \\"Okay.\\" * * * - Only 1 hour left until the 30-day project ends. In the fridge, there's one orange, two hot dogs, and so many protein shakes left. If I were to give advice to those who will take on the same challenge, protein shakes were really the worst choice. I posted on my 'Face Paper' account. Encouraging comments started pouring in. Along with countless offers to buy me a meal. Dennis brought both hot dogs, heated up. \\"Seong-guk, I specially heated up both hot dogs for you.\\" \\"Dennis, do you want to eat one? If I eat two hot dogs, I might never be able to eat hot dogs again.\\" \\"You're really amazing. How did you think of living like this for a month?\\" \\"I never thought it would be this terrible when I started.\\" I picked up the last hot dog. Dennis and I clinked our hot dogs together and took a bite. [I'll never touch hot dogs again in my life.] Still, I forced the hot dog into my mouth. Dennis enjoyed his hot dog. \\"Seong-guk, everyone on your 'Face Paper' is in a festive mood. They're doing a countdown. It's almost midnight, so your challenge is ending, right?\\" \\"Yeah....\\" I threw the last hot dog stick into the trash can. [It's really over now!] At the same time, there was a knock. Knock. \\"Who is it?\\" Before Dennis could finish speaking, the door burst open, and Mark and Jessie entered the room with pizza and various foods. Michelle Jona and a camera were also visible behind them. \\"Seong-guk, that day's broadcast became such an issue that I came without contacting you first. Sorry.\\" \\"It's okay.\\" Michelle Jona quickly made a brief comment. \\"Today is the day Seong-guk Jeon's 30 living for a month project ends. Harvard dormitory is already in a festive mood. Friends have brought pizza and various foods to celebrate the end of the project.\\" The dormitory friends also gathered around my room. Everyone was there to celebrate the end of my project together. \\"Alright, Seong-guk. Less than a minute left. Let's all do the countdown together.\\" At Michelle Jona's words, everyone agreed. I stood among the students and joined the countdown. \\"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Congratulations!\\" Michelle Jona pushed the microphone towards me. \\"Seong-guk, what do you want to eat the most right now?\\" \\"My dad's bossam.\\" \\"Korean food, huh?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Unfortunately, it might be hard to find bossam here right now, so what among these do you want to eat the most?\\" \\"Of course!\\" I immediately grabbed a well-fried chicken leg. \\"Chicken!\\" And then I took a big bite. At the same time, my friends cheered loudly again. * * * The dormitory room turned into a party scene. Michelle Jona also joined the party, eating and enjoying the food. \\"Seong-guk, the bulletin board was in chaos after the broadcast. Many people were curious about you, wondering how such a genius could also be so handsome.\\" \\"Thank you for airing it well.\\" I was stuffing myself with food. Unintentionally fasting for a month made me lose a lot of weight, and thanks to that, I looked even better on camera. Mark approached and handed me my favorite burger. \\"Seong-guk, your favorite burger. I even rented a car to get this.\\" True friends were different. \\"Mark, really, thank you.\\" At that moment, my phone rang loudly. I had a feeling I knew who it was. As expected, the caller ID showed Peter Branton. I took the phone and headed to a quiet corner. As I walked to the corner, my classmates congratulated me. Finally settling in a corner, I answered the call. - Seong-guk, congratulations! I just checked the results on 'Face Paper.' \\"Thank you.\\" - Seong-guk, can you come to New York next weekend with Mark? I'll provide everything, including plane tickets and hotel. Oh, and that roommate friend too. \\"Without any strings attached?\\" - Of course. \\"See you in New York next week.\\" I happily chose to go to New York. * * * As the sun rose, my classmates left the dormitory. Mark and Dennis also looked sleepy. I quickly glanced at Mark and Dennis. \\"By the way, we're all going to New York next week. Peter said he's booked the flights and hotel.\\" \\"Me too?\\" Dennis asked. \\"Yes. Peter said he was grateful for your help with 'Face Paper.' I told him you're writing a screenplay with an art school in New York as the backdrop. Wouldn't it be good to go and see it?\\" \\"Awesome! Seong-guk. I can't believe it. Being with you feels like everything is possible.\\" [Of course, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] I shrugged my shoulders as humbly as I could. \\"Mark, let's prepare a bit on how we'll proceed with the business with Peter.\\" \\"Seong-guk, are we really starting a business with this?\\" \\"Mark, from the moment I told you about this idea, I planned to do this.\\" Mark patted my shoulder. \\"Let's go for it. When else will we get to take such a challenge?\\" [Of course, the outcome will be grand, Mark. Just trust me.] I smiled victoriously. * * * \\"Are we really in first class right now?\\" Mark and Dennis's eyes were wide open. [Why are they acting so country-like.] I've been lucky enough to fly first class from my previous life to this one. Mark glanced at me. \\"Seong-guk, does this mean Peter really values us highly?\\" [Oh, hanging around with me a bit and now you're starting to make some judgments, Mark?] I nodded slightly. \\"It seems so. We can definitely turn this to our advantage. 'Face Paper' has become incredibly famous among American moms who want to send their kids to Harvard.\\" \\"Thanks to The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I was just beginning to realize the influence of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which was leading in ratings in the US. I learned through Michelle Jona that several places had contacted the broadcast station or even the school for investment proposals. However, what I wanted was a proven, stable investment. In the meantime, Dennis had arranged to visit one of the art schools in New York he had looked up. \\"Seong-guk, it would be great if you could come too. Will you have time?\\" \\"When's the appointment?\\" \\"Tomorrow evening.

This was my first time here too. As a school located in New York, it had a small campus where everything happened in one building, but the faculty were all important figures in the American music scene. \\"I'm learning drums from this person, John Keith. In the drumming world, he's just a legend.\\" \\"What's his personality like?

There are many times when my heart races before going into his class... We talk about it among ourselves. John doesn't hit us with drumsticks; he beats us with his words.

It'll bring back memories and feel good.\\" Dennis took the drumsticks offered by Miles. Then, sitting in front of the drums, he started making various sounds at first. Then, he played a short piece exactly. Miles looked at Dennis with admiration. \\"You play well?\\" \\"No, I just practiced this piece to death back then.\\" Dennis put down the drumsticks with a hint of regret. * * Dennis and I trudged to the place where we had arranged to meet Peter. Dennis's face, after the interview, was filled with a wistful longing. \\"Dennis, do you regret giving up on drums?\\" \\"Sometimes I do. I wonder what it would have been like if I hadn't been hurt by that teacher's words and had honed my skills more.\\" \\"What if the protagonist of the movie had that kind of personality? You know, there are people who get stronger the more they are whipped. They harbor a fierce determination to surpass that person's words someday.

Hoe kan ik je helpen?"},{"prompt":"Schrijf een verhaal over Jan van Leeuwen, Jan is een geweldige Rockabilly drummer die helaas kinkhoest heeft en niet kan slapen. Jan probeert in slaap te vallen maar het lukt niet door de hoestbuien.","completion":"In het hart van een bruisende muziekscene, waar neonlichten de nacht kleurden en de klanken van rockabilly de lucht vulden, leefde eens een drummer genaamd Jan van Leeuwen. Jan was geen gewone drummer; zijn talent was zo uitzonderlijk dat men zei dat hij met zijn stokken kon toveren. Zodra hij begon te spelen, werd de wereld rondom hem een orkaan van ritmes en melodieën, waardoor iedereen in de zaal gegrepen werd door een onweerstaanbare drang om te dansen. Maar het rock-'n-roll leven had zijn schaduwzijde. Terwijl de band van Jan, The Stray Comets, op het punt stond door te breken en landelijk erkend te worden, werd Jan geveld door kinkhoest. Een verraderlijke ziekte die zijn nachten in een strijd veranderde. In plaats van de stilte van de nacht gevuld met dromen, werd zijn slaapkamer een podium voor een oneindige reeks hoestbuien die hem wakker hielden. Op een nacht, terwijl de maan hoog aan de hemel hing en de rest van de wereld in diepe slaap verzonken was, lag Jan weer eens wakker in bed. Zijn gedachten dwaalden af naar een leven zonder ziekte, waar hij zonder zorgen kon drummen tot de zon opkwam. Maar elke hoestbui trok hem weer terug in de harde realiteit. In een moment van wanhoop besloot Jan het onmogelijke te proberen. Als hij niet kon slapen door zijn hoest, waarom zou hij dan niet drummen? Misschien was de cadans van zijn eigen ritmes wel genoeg om de ziekte voor een moment het zwijgen op te leggen. Op kousenvoeten sloop hij naar zijn drumstel, dat in de hoek van de kamer stond, glimmend onder het zwakke maanlicht dat door het raam viel. Zachtjes, bijna teder, begon hij een eenvoudige beat te spelen. Langzamerhand, terwijl hij zich mee liet voeren op de golven van de muziek, voelde Jan hoe zijn lichaam ontspande en zijn ademhaling gestaagder werd. Wat begonnen was als een wanhopige poging om rust te vinden, veranderde al snel in een sessie van muzikale magie. De hoestbuien bleven weg, verdreven door het ritme dat door Jans aderen vloeide. Voor de eerste keer in weken voelde hij een diepe rust over zich heen komen. De muziek had hem gebracht waar de stilte en de nacht dat niet konden. Terwijl de eerste zonnestralen de horizon kleurden, viel Jan eindelijk in slaap, omhuld door de echo's van zijn laatste ritme. In zijn dromen speelde hij voor een eindeloos publiek, vrij van ziekte en pijn, een eeuwige rockabilly ster. Jans strijd met kinkhoest was nog niet voorbij, maar die nacht had hem iets kostbaars geleerd. Soms, in de donkerste uren, kan muziek meer dan alleen een passie zijn; het kan een redding zijn, een genezing voor het lijden dat het leven soms brengt."},{"prompt":"Ga verder met het verhaal maar voeg het karakter Marco Stolker toe, een geweldige rockabilly contrabassist die Jan van Leeuwen versteld doet staan.","completion":"Terwijl Jan zijn innerlijke strijd vocht met de kinkhoest en de slapeloze nachten, vond er elders in de stad, op een verwarmd podium, een andere muzikale wervelwind plaats. Daar stond Marco Stolker, een contrabassist wiens faam begon te rijzen in de wereld van rockabilly. Marco, met zijn slanke vingers die dansen over de snaren alsof hij geboren was met een bas in zijn handen, had een natuurlijke allure die het publiek betoverde. Zijn spel was niet alleen technisch verbluffend, maar bracht ook een diepe emotionele lading met zich mee die zich perfect vermengde met de rauwe energie van rockabilly. Op een dag, toen Jan van Leeuwen in een goed moment van gezondheid een lokale muziekbar binnenwandelde, was het Marco die op het podium stond. Jan, die altijd op zoek was naar inspiratie en potentieel talent voor The Stray Comets, bleef als aan de grond genageld staan toen hij Marco's vaardigheden op de contrabas zag. Het was alsof elk akkoord, elke noot die Marco speelde, een eigen leven had, een verhaal vertelde dat dieper ging dan muziek alleen. Jan voelde onmiddellijk dat Marco's unieke stijl het ontbrekende stukje kon zijn dat The Stray Comets naar nieuwe hoogten kon tillen. Na het optreden wachtte Jan tot de menigte was verdwenen en benaderde hij Marco, die zijn contrabas zorgvuldig in de hoes deed. \\"Hey, ik ben Jan van Leeuwen,\\" begon Jan, zijn hand uitstekend in een vriendelijk, maar enigszins zenuwachtig, gebaar. Marco keek op, herkende Jan meteen als de legendarische drummer van The Stray Comets, en schudde zijn hand met een mengeling van respect en verbazing. \\"Marco Stolker. Man, het is een eer om jou te ontmoeten. Ik ben een grote fan van je werk,\\" antwoordde Marco met een oprechte glimlach. Het gesprek dat volgde voelde voor beiden aan als het begin van een belangrijke muzikale kameraadschap. Jan sprak over zijn strijd met kinkhoest en hoe het hem had gedwongen om muziek op een andere manier te benaderen, meer introspectief. Marco luisterde aandachtig, zijn bewondering voor Jan groeiend met elk woord dat werd gesproken. Aan het einde van de nacht deed Jan iets wat hij nog nooit eerder had gedaan; hij vroeg Marco om zich bij The Stray Comets aan te sluiten. Marco, overdonderd en gevleid, accepteerde het aanbod. De komende weken repeteerden ze intensief, en de chemie tussen Jan en Marco, en natuurlijk de rest van de band, was onmiskenbaar. Marco's contrabas gaf de band een diepte en warmte die ze voorheen misten, terwijl Jan's vernieuwde passie voor muziek, aangewakkerd door zijn recente worstelingen, de band een ongekende energie gaf. De eerste keer dat ze samen optraden, was magisch. Zelfs Jan, die zijn hele leven had gewijd aan muziek, voelde iets nieuws en opwindends in de lucht hangen. Het publiek was extatisch, elke noot, elk akkoord resoneerde met een passie en intensiteit die men zelden zag. Het duo Jan en Marco groeide uit tot een legendarische combinatie binnen de rockabilly-scene, zowel op als naast het podium geroemd om hun muzikale broederschap. Ze hadden misschien uit verschillende werelden kunnen komen, maar samen vormden ze een nieuw universum waarin muziek niet alleen werd gespeeld, maar geleefd. En hoewel Jan's kinkhoest hem altijd zou blijven herinneren aan de fragiliteit van het leven, herinnerde zijn vriendschap met Marco hem er ook aan dat soms, in de donkerste nachten, het licht van ware vriendschap en muzikale verbondenheid het felst schijnt."},{"prompt":"Ga verder, Jan heeft besloten over dit verhaal een boek te schrijven maar valt steeds in slaap.","completion":"Gedreven door de overweldigende ervaringen en de muzikale renaissance die zijn leven had getransformeerd, besloot Jan van Leeuwen zijn verhaal met de wereld te delen door een boek te schrijven. Hij zag het als een kans om niet alleen zijn persoonlijke strijd en overwinningen vast te leggen, maar ook om de onverwachte vriendschap met Marco Stolker te eren, die zo'n beslissende invloed had op zijn leven en carrière. Jan zat in zijn studeerkamer, omringd door stapels notitieblokken vol met aantekeningen, foto's van optredens, en oude setlijsten. Zijn computer stond open op een leeg document, klaar om gevuld te worden met verhalen en herinneringen. Echter, telkens wanneer Jan begon te typen, overviel een onverklaarbare moeheid hem. Jarenlang had slaap hem ontweken als gevolg van zijn kinkhoest, maar nu, op het moment dat hij zich er het meest bewust van was, leek het alsof de vermoeidheid die verloren tijd inhaalde. De ijzeren grip van de slaap sleepte hem weg van zijn schrijftafel, zijn pogingen om het boek te schrijven onderbrekend. Jan probeerde alles, van koffie tot korte wandelingen in de frisse lucht, maar niets kon de lokroep van de slaap weerstaan. Het begon zo’n probleem te worden dat Jan vreesde dat het boek misschien nooit zou worden voltooid. Op een middag, terwijl Jan weer eens in slaap was gevallen boven zijn toetsenbord, bezocht Marco hem onaangekondigd. Hij vond Jan diep in slaap, met zijn voorhoofd rustend tussen de toetsen. Marco kon een glimlach niet onderdrukken bij het zien van dit tafereel. In plaats van Jan wakker te maken, besloot Marco de kamer stil te verlaten. Echter, voor hij wegging, kreeg hij een idee. De volgende keer dat Marco kwam, bracht hij een oud cassette-recorder mee, een geschenk aan Jan. \\"Begin met spreken in plaats van te schrijven,\\" suggereerde Marco. \\"Vertel je verhaal hardop. Ik zal al je verhalen verzamelen, transcriberen en organiseren. Samen krijgen we dit boek af.\\" Dit bleek de oplossing te zijn waar Jan onbewust naar verlangd had. Het proces van het vertellen van zijn verhaal, met de stem in plaats van met de pen, was bevrijdend en energiek. Jan's levendige beschrijvingen van zijn muzikale avonturen en de diepe band met Marco, alle verteld met die karakteristieke rasp in zijn stem, gaven het verhaal een nieuwe dimensie. Marco besteedde vele uren aan het luisteren, transcriberen en in de juiste volgorde zetten van Jans vertellingen. Terwijl Jan vertelde, realiseerde hij zich hoe therapeutisch dit proces was, niet alleen voor zijn boek, maar voor zijn ziel. Met Marco's hulp transformeerde Jan zijn slapeloosheid in creatieve energie. Het boek, uiteindelijk getiteld \\"Ritmes van de Nacht: De Rockabilly Renovatie van Jan van Leeuwen\\", werd een bescheiden hit onder muziekliefhebbers en een inspiratie voor degenen die worstelden met persoonlijke demonen. Wat begon als een project beladen met uitdagingen, eindigde als een testament van veerkracht, vriendschap, en de helende kracht van muziek. En voor Jan en Marco werd het een blijvend bewijs van hun onbreekbare band, vastgelegd in de pagina's van een boek dat uit veel meer bestond dan alleen woorden."},{"prompt":"Een nieuw verhaal over Jan van Leeuwen die het genot ontdekt van het drummen met hotdog worstjes in plaats van drumsticks.","completion":"Jan van Leeuwen stond bekend om zijn vermogen om de drums tot leven te brengen op manieren die niemand voor mogelijk hield. Na jaren van spelen met de traditionele drumsticks en het experimenteren met verschillende materialen en vormen, was Jan toe aan iets volledig anders. Het podium, de muziek, zelfs zijn trouwe drumstel voelden plotseling te bekend aan, te voorspelbaar. Hij wilde de vonk terug, dat gevoel van pure innovatie en onverwachte wonderen die de essentie vormden van ware rockabilly. Op een zomeravond, na een lange repetitie met The Stray Comets, zat Jan met zijn bandleden in de achtertuin, te genieten van een welverdiende barbecue. Er werd gelachen, gegeten en herinneringen opgehaald. Toen Marco plotseling een gewaagde suggestie deed, \\"Waarom probeer je niet eens met iets compleet absurds te drummen? Zoals, ik weet niet... hotdog worstjes?\\" De band lachte bij het idee, en het leek eerst slechts een grap te zijn te midden van vele andere. Jan, echter, kon het idee niet uit zijn hoofd zetten. Wie had er immers gezegd dat muziek en het maken ervan zich moesten houden aan strikte regels? Waarom kon hij niet drummen met iets zo ongewoon als hotdog worstjes? Het was absurd, ja, maar ook briljant op een vreemde manier. Het zou absoluut een primeur zijn, een unieke fusion van eten en muziek, letterlijk. De volgende dag, zonder de minste spot, kocht Jan een partij hotdog worstjes, stevig genoeg om mogelijk enig misbruik te doorstaan. Zijn bandleden keken toe in een mix van verbazing en amusement toen hij de worstjes handig tussen zijn vingers manoeuvreerde, klaar om ze als drumsticks te gebruiken. Er hing een sensatie van pure anticipatie in de lucht terwijl de eerste slag naderde. Toen Jan begon te drummen met de hotdog worstjes, was het resultaat verrassend muzikaal. De worstjes boden een dempend maar toch veerkrachtig gevoel tegen de drumvellen. Elk ritme dat hij speelde, voelde nieuw en avontuurlijk. De klanken waren zachter en hadden een unieke textuur, iets dat met traditionele sticks onmogelijk te bereiken was. Het was alsof Jan een geheel nieuwe dimensie van drummen had geopend. De band was eerst verbluft, maar raakte snel geïnspireerd door Jans creatieve durf. Marco pakte zijn contrabas met een nieuwe vurigheid, en de rest van The Stray Comets volgde. Wat begon als een lachwekkend experiment, groeide uit tot een innovatieve jamsessie, geleid door de onwaarschijnlijke klanken van hotdog worstjes op een drumstel. Jan's genot in deze nieuwe manier van drummen was duidelijk. Het was niet alleen de nieuwheid of het ongewone dat hem boeide; het was het besef dat muzikaliteit geen grenzen kent, geen definitieve regels of het juiste gereedschap. Muziek was vrij en onbegrensd, wachtend om geëxploreerd te worden met elke beschikbare middel, zelfs als dat middel zo ongebruikelijk was als hotdog worstjes. Dit bijzondere experiment werd snel een legendarisch verhaal binnen de muziekscene, vaak aangehaald als voorbeeld van creativiteit en buiten-de-kaders denken. Voor Jan was het een herinnering dat muziek, in zijn kern, gaat over plezier, ontdekking, en het onverwachte omarmen. Het was een les die hij nooit zou vergeten, elke keer als hij naar zijn drumstel keek, met of zonder traditionele drumsticks in de hand."},{"prompt":"teach me this While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary.","completion":"Sure! Let's delve into these concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand. **Pure Substances**: A pure substance is a form of matter that has a constant composition and properties that are consistent throughout the sample. It contains only one type of particle, which can be an atom or a molecule. There are two main types of pure substances: **elements** and **compounds**. - **Elements** are pure substances that consist of a single type of atom. For example, a piece of copper wire is made up entirely of copper atoms, making it a pure substance. - **Compounds** are pure substances formed when two or more types of atoms combine in a specific ratio and manner. For example, water (H₂O) is a compound made from hydrogen and oxygen atoms combined in a 2:1 ratio. Despite being composed of more than one type of atom, it's considered a pure substance because every molecule of water is identical in composition and properties. **Mixtures**: Mixtures, on the other hand, are combinations of two or more substances (elements and/or compounds) where the constituent parts retain their chemical identities and properties. The composition of a mixture is not fixed; it can vary according to how much of each substance is present. Mixtures are categorized into **homogeneous mixtures** and **heterogeneous mixtures**. - **Homogeneous Mixtures** are mixtures that are uniform throughout. This means that the composition and properties are the same throughout the mixture. Solutions, such as salt dissolved in water or air (a mixture of gases), are good examples of homogeneous mixtures. - **Heterogeneous Mixtures** are mixtures that are not uniform throughout. The composition and properties vary from one part of the mixture to another. Examples include a salad, a plate of sand mixed with salt, and even rocky soil. **Key Differences**: - **Composition**: Pure substances have a fixed composition (elements are made of single types of atoms, and compounds consist of molecules with a specific ratio of atoms). Mixtures have variable compositions. - **Properties**: Pure substances have constant physical and chemical properties throughout the sample (melting point, boiling point, reactivity). Mixtures have properties that can vary because they depend on the ratio and identity of the substances mixed. - **Separation**: Components of a mixture can usually be separated by physical means (filtration, distillation, etc) because they retain their individual properties. In contrast, separating a compound into its constituent elements requires a chemical reaction. Understanding the distinction between pure substances and mixtures is fundamental in chemistry because it helps us to classify and study matter in a systematic way, allowing us to predict behaviors, uses, and reactions of different materials."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[눈치 없는 자식.] “의도한 건 아니지만, 둘 다 싱글이니 괜찮을 것 같아서.” “성국이도 은근 눈치 없는데, 마크 너는 더 없구나?” [데니스, 뭐라는 거야?] 나는 눈을 가늘게 뜨고 데니스를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 피터랑 그레이스랑 사귀게 되면 사업하는 데 도움 될 것 같아서 소개시켜준 거지?” [역시 예술가는 다른가. 눈치가 빠르네.] “뭐 그런 것도 좀 있고…. 하지만 난 정말 피터도 좋은 사람 같고, 그레이스야 당연히 좋은 사람이고 해서 소개해준 거야. 외로운 사람들끼리 뉴욕에 있는데, 만나면 좋잖아.” “대박! 나만 몰랐던 거네!” [응, 마크. 너는 진짜 눈치는 정말 없어.] 마크가 어이없다는 듯 맥주를 들이켰다. “마크, 진정해. 근데 난 오늘 좀 흥미로웠어.” “데니스, 넌 뭐가 그렇게 재미있어?” “성국이 보면 우리보다 나이도 어린데 항상 성숙하게 행동하잖아. 목적도 분명하고. 근데 오늘 약점을 알았어.” [내 약점을 알았다고? 나 약점 같은 건 없는 남자인데…. 근데 왜 자신 없어지지….] 데니스는 피식 웃더니 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 기분 나쁘게 듣지 마.” [들어서 기분 나쁠 말은 안 하면 되는 거잖아!] “어서 말해봐, 데니스. 뭔데?” 마크가 호기심 가득한 얼굴로 재촉했다. “성국이 약점은 바로 연애야. 남녀 관계를 너무, 그러니까… 수학 공식처럼 이해하고 있는 거야.” 마크는 맥주를 마시며 흥미로운 눈빛으로 데니스를 쳐다봤다. “그게 무슨 말이야?” “성국이는 연애란 것도 목적을 가지고 보는 것 같아. 오늘 우연히 길을 가다가 그레이스라는 여자분을 만났고, 바로 피터에게 연락해서 자리를 마련했잖아.” “그치.” “식당에 들어가자마자 성국은 피터 옆에 그레이스를 앉혔고, 평소와 달리 말도 없이 스테이크를 마구 먹는 거야. 마치 어서 먹고 나가려는 사람처럼.” [배가 고팠다고!] 나는 근질거리는 입을 꾹 다물었다. “우리가 아무 말 없이 스테이크만 먹으니 피터와 그레이스가 자연스레 대화를 시작했고, 성국은 마치 그때를 기다린 것처럼 스테이크를 입에 욱여넣고 하품을 해댔잖아. 성국이가 원래도 계획적으로 모든 일을 진행하는 건 알았지만, 그건 몰랐던 거지.” [내가 뭘 몰라!] “연애와 사람의 마음은 계획대로 절대 진행되지 않는다는 거.” “맞아! 맞아!” 마크는 손바닥까지 치며 웃고 있었다. [지금 감히 날 놀리는 거야?] “성국, 맞지?” 데니스가 나를 쳐다봤다. “맞기도 하고 틀리기도 해.” “성국이가 저렇게 삐친 척 말하면 맞는 거야.” 마크는 나 놀리기에 이미 신이 난 상태였다. [이 녀석들이랑 좀 거리를 둬야겠어. 날 너무 잘 아는데….] 데니스는 마크의 응원에 힘입어 계속 떠들어댔다. “성국이는 한마디로 아직 연애에 대해서는 전혀 모른다! 그게 내가 내린 결론이야!” “난 열두 살이니까.” 나는 최대한 태연하게 어깨를 으쓱했다. 저번 생에서 연애야 수없이 했지만, 항상 나는 갑의 위치였다. 여자들은 내가 빙긋 웃기만 해도 뭐든지 다 해줬다. 연애의 정석 같은 책들은 몇 권 보기도 했지만, 굳이 어렵게 여자의 심리까지 파악할 이유는 대부분 없었다. [그게 약점이 된 건가…. 책이라도 읽어야 하나….] 데니스가 웃으며 심각한 표정을 짓고 있는 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 너 분명 지금 연애학개론 같은 책이 있나 찾아봐야겠다고 생각하고 있지?” 뜨끔. [데니스 저 녀석, 사람 속을 꿰뚫고 있네.] 마크가 신기한 듯 물었다. “데니스, 넌 어떻게 그렇게 사람의 마음을 잘 아는 거야?” “영화나 소설, 모든 것은 사실은 일어나지 않은 일인데 그럴듯하게 만드는 거잖아. 그 안에 캐릭터들도 살아 숨 쉬듯 그려야 하고. 그러려면 사람의 심리를 잘 알아야 하는데, 가장 좋은 방법은 주변 사람들을 관찰하는 거거든.” “데니스, 난 절대 관찰하지 마.” 마크가 한 발짝 뒤로 몸을 뺐다. “나쁜 의미로 관찰하는 게 아니라… 완벽한 성국이 같은 친구한테도 사실은 약점이 있다, 그런 거 인간적인 거잖아. 평소에는 외모도, 하는 행동도 분명 애늙은이인데, 연애에서는 완전 약하잖아. 너무 인간적이지 않아?” “성국이가 실전 연애에는 약하지. 아니지, 성국이는 실전 연애 경험이 전무하잖아.” “마크, 네가 할 말은 아닌 거 같은데….” 내가 얼른 마크를 놀렸다. 마크는 맥주를 벌컥벌컥 마시더니 단호하게 이야기했다. “나, 좋아하는 사람 생겼어.” [뭐야, 전혀 안 놀라워.] 마크는 금사빠였다. 데니스도 별로 놀라워하지 않았다. “제시는 포기한 거야?” “응. 제시는 내가 넘기에는 너무 높은 허들 같아. 뭐, 제시가 나 좋다고 하면 모르지만.” [꿈 깨, 마크.] “그래서 누군데?” 데니스가 재촉했다. “미셸 어때?” [혹 미셸! 내가 아는 미셸? 이런 헛다리 전문 녀석 같으니라고. 쯧쯧쯧.] 나는 속으로 혀를 끌끌 찼다. 오늘 데니스의 맨해튼 음악 학교를 연결해준 건 미셸 조나였다. 그 말인즉슨, 데니스와 미셸 조나가 사적으로 연락을 주고받고 있단 말이었다. 나는 얼른 데니스의 눈치를 살폈다. 당혹감이 얼굴에 비쳤다. [내가 연애는 몰라도, 눈치는 한 눈치 한다고. 가난한 집에서 태어나서 먹고살려면 탑재해야 하는 건 바로 눈치야.] 마크가 신이 나서 미셸에 대해서 떠들어댔다. “엘렌 윈프리 쇼 때문에 만났지만, 미셸… 굉장히, 사람이 뭐랄까. 시원시원하고. 그리고 우리 어리다고 무시하지도 않고… 말도 잘 통할 것 같아.” “잘 통하는 거 아니고 그럴 것 같다는 거지?” 내가 묻자 마크가 고개를 크게 끄덕였다. 나는 데니스를 슬쩍 쳐다봤다. “데니스, 할 말 없어? 나는 말이야. 친구 사이에 이성 문제로 꼬이는 거 딱 질색이야.” “아, 그게….” 데니스는 몇 번 어색하게 말을 꺼내더니 마크를 쳐다봤다. “마크, 사실은 미셸이랑 내가 연락을 자주 주고받거든.” “…어… 지, 진짜?” 마크의 큰 두 눈이 흔들렸다. [지진 난 줄.] 나는 팔짱을 끼고 뒤로 몸을 뺐다. [이런 건 당사자들끼리 해결하는 거야.] 데니스는 몇 번 머리를 벅벅 긁더니, 마크에게 이야기하기 시작했다. “솔직히 아직 사귄다, 뭐 그런 관계는 아니야. 그리고… 나 혼자만의 착각일 수도 있는데, 이야기도 잘 통하는 거 같고. 나는 영화에 관심이 많고, 미셸은 방송 일을 하니까. 서로 통하는 게 많다고 할까. 근데 아직 그 정도야.” 마크가 갑자기 크게 웃어댔다. “푸하하하. 데니스! 걱정 마!” [마크, 또 오버한다.] 내가 오랫동안 마크를 봐온 결과, 마크는 지금 엄청 당황하고 있었다. 왜냐하면 마크의 말이 빨라지고 논리는 없어졌기 때문이다. “데니스, 나도 미셸한테 막 관심이 갔던 거 아니야. 제시가 나를 안 받아주니까. 대학생도 됐는데 나도 누구라도 연애를 해야 할 거 아니야. 난 미셸이랑 대화 나눈 것도 별로 없고. 사실은 인터뷰가 다야. 그러니까 뭐, 미셸을 짝사랑하고 그런 거 전혀 아니니까, 걱정 마. 난 괜찮아. 진짜 괜찮아. 진짜 괜찮을 거야. 이런 일 한두 번 있는 것도 아니고….” 나는 마크의 어깨에 손을 얹었다. “마크, 맥주나 마셔.” “…아, 맥주. 그렇지. 마셔야지. 오늘 같은 날 마셔야지. 말도 못 걸어봤는데, 차였잖아.” “마크… 미안. 만약 미셸이 나한테 관심 없으면 바로 알려줄게.” [데니스, 마크 비참하게 왜 그래?] 나는 고개를 절레절레 저었다. 마크는 맥주를 벌컥 마셨다. “아, 아니야. 내 영혼의 반쪽도 분명 이 세상에 존재할 거야. 그렇겠지, 성국?” “아마도….” [앞으로는 1인 가구가 대세가 될 거야. 마크 너도 동참해!] 나는 마크의 어깨를 도닥였다. * * * 맥주를 연달아 세 병을 마신 마크는 충격으로 침대에 뻗어버렸다. [그래, 차라리 자는 게 낫지.] 데니스는 맥주를 홀짝였다. “내가 너무했나….” “진실은 빨리 알릴수록 좋아. 걱정 마. 마크가 뒤끝은 없어. 금사빠라 금방 빠지고, 금방 또 빠져나와. 그러곤 굶주린 해파리처럼 누굴 찾아 헤맬 거야.” “그럼 다행이고…. 근데 왜 해파리야? 하이에나도 아니고?” “마크가 은근 투명하거든. 속내가 다 보인다고 할까. 해파리 마크. 나만 혼자 생각하는 마크 별명이야.” “성국, 너도 은근 웃긴 데가 있어.” [내가 재벌 중에서는 제일 웃겼는데. 그런 말은 또 할 수 없지.] 나는 깡생수를 들이켰다. “데니스. 솔직히 너, 미셸이랑 사귀는 거지?” 내가 진지하게 물었다. 데니스는 내성적인 편이고 신중한 성격이었다. 뭔가 확실한 단서가 없다면 저 정도로 이야기하지 않았을 것이다. 내 말에 데니스가 머리를 긁적였다. “어… 사귀자고 서로 말한 건 아니고. 그래도 호감은 확실한 거 같아. 내일 하버드로 가기 전에 만나기로 했어.” “물론 넌 처음엔 우리 이야기도 하면서 같이 만나는 거냐고 떠봤겠지? 근데, 미셸이 둘이 보자고 한 거지? 내 추측 어때?” “정확한데.” 데니스가 수줍게 미소 지었다. 어깨가 간만에 올라갔다. “데니스, 내가 연애는 모르지만 눈치는 빠르지?” “그래, 그건 인정할게.” 데니스가 빙긋 웃었다. “데니스, 우리 중에 가장 빨리 솔로 탈출한 거 축하해!” “고마워.” 나는 뒤를 돌아 침대에 뻗어서 자는 마크를 뒤돌아봤다. [하아, 가족들 말고 챙겨야 할 놈이 한 명 더 늘었네. 쯧쯧쯧.] 나는 고개를 가로저었다.","completion":"Episode 109 Perhaps because it was a time of growth, eating steak two days in a row did not tire me. Mark, Dennis, and I eagerly stuffed steak into our mouths. Only Peter and Grace ate their steak slowly. \\"So, you've known Sungguk since he was little?\\" \\"Yes. I think Sungguk was about ten years old when I first saw him, in Korean age. Even then, I was surprised by how bold he was for his age, but I didn't expect him to grow up so quickly.\\" [Let's stop talking about me and talk about each other.] While eating steak, I alternated my gaze between Peter and Grace. Dennis subtly poked me in the ribs. \\"Sungguk, if you glare at them like that, they won't be able to talk.\\" [Huh. Did they notice…] I pushed the last piece of steak into my mouth and looked at Mark and Dennis. They had almost finished their plates as well. I carefully yawned. \\"Sungguk, are you tired?\\" Peter quickly caught on to my condition. [It seems Grace has caught your eye.] I yawned again silently and nodded. \\"Peter, today was really tough. Dennis and I went for an interview at the Manhattan Music College. We met Grace on our way back.\\" Mark added an explanation. \\"You must be really tired. Then, let's call it an early night and rest. We can resume our negotiations once the contract is sorted out.\\" \\"Peter, as promised, Mark and I will pay for the meal today.\\" \\"We enjoyed the meal.\\" \\"I enjoyed it too.\\" Grace also gracefully smiled and said her goodbyes. [They're telling me to leave quickly.] I quickly got up from my seat. Mark and Dennis also stood up, and I split the bill with Mark. \\"Sungguk, spending money like this makes me feel like we're truly partners, and it feels good.\\" \\"Should we continue to split the bill even when we start making a lot of money?\\" \\"That sounds good. If we really start making a lot of money, I'll treat you sometimes too.\\" Mark laughed, showing his teeth. * * * Back at the hotel, I sat down with Dennis and a laptop. Mark looked at me with a surprised face. \\"Sungguk, I thought you were tired?\\" \\"I made space for Peter and Grace so they could talk more naturally. We had to step back for them to have a good conversation.\\" \\"Was today a setup for a blind date?\\" Mark asked, surprised. [Clueless guy.] \\"It wasn't intentional, but since both are single, I thought it would be okay.\\" \\"Sungguk is also clueless, but Mark, you're even more so?\\" [Dennis, what are you saying?] I narrowed my eyes and looked at Dennis. \\"Sungguk, you introduced Peter and Grace because it might help with business if they started dating, right?\\" [Maybe artists are different. He's quick-witted.] \\"Well, there's a bit of that… But I really introduced them because I think Peter is a good person, and of course, Grace is a good person too. It's nice for lonely people to meet each other in New York.\\" \\"Wow! I was the only one who didn't know!\\" [Yeah, Mark. You really are clueless.] Mark incredulously gulped down his beer. \\"Mark, calm down. But today was interesting for me.\\" \\"Dennis, what was so interesting?\\" \\"Sungguk always acts maturely despite being younger than us. He's always clear about his goals. But today, I discovered his weakness.\\" [My weakness? I'm a man without weaknesses… But why do I feel insecure…] Dennis smirked and looked at me. \\"Sungguk, don't take this the wrong way.\\" [If you don't want me to take it the wrong way, don't say it!] \\"Go on, Dennis. What is it?\\" Mark urged with curiosity. \\"Sungguk's weakness is definitely romance. He understands relationships between men and women too much like… a mathematical formula.\\" Mark listened with interest as he drank his beer. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Sungguk seems to view romance as something with a goal. Today, we happened to meet a woman named Grace on the street, and Sungguk immediately contacted Peter to arrange a meeting.\\" \\"Right.\\" \\"As soon as we entered the restaurant, Sungguk made sure Grace sat next to Peter, and unlike usual, he just kept eating steak without saying a word, as if he wanted to leave quickly.\\" [I was just hungry!] I clenched my mouth, feeling itchy. \\"Since we didn't say anything and just ate our steak, Peter and Grace naturally started talking, and Sungguk, as if waiting for that moment, stuffed steak into his mouth and yawned. I knew Sungguk always plans everything, but I didn't know this.\\" [I know what I'm doing!] \\"Romance and human emotions never go as planned.\\" \\"Exactly! Exactly!\\" Mark clapped his hands and laughed. [Are they daring to make fun of me?] \\"Sungguk, right?\\" Dennis looked at me. \\"It's both right and wrong.\\" \\"When Sungguk talks like that, pretending to be upset, it means it's right.\\" Mark was already excited to tease me. [I need to distance myself from these guys. They know me too well.] Empowered by Mark's encouragement, Dennis continued to talk. \\"In short, Sungguk knows nothing about real-life romance! That's my conclusion!\\" \\"I'm only twelve years old.\\" I shrugged my shoulders as casually as possible. In my previous life, I had countless relationships, always being in a dominant position. Women would do anything just with a slight smile from me. I had read a few books on the essence of romance, but there was rarely a need to delve into the psychology of women. [Is that my weakness… Should I read a book…] Dennis looked at me, trying to keep a serious face while smiling. \\"Sungguk, you're probably thinking right now whether there's a book like 'Introduction to Romance', aren't you?\\" Caught off guard. [Dennis, that guy, can really see through people.] Mark asked in amazement. \\"Dennis, how do you understand people's hearts so well?\\" \\"Movies and novels, everything is about making something that hasn't happened seem plausible. The characters in them need to feel alive and breathing. To do that, you need to understand human psychology well, and the best way is to observe the people around you.\\" \\"Dennis, never observe me.\\" Mark stepped back. \\"It's not about observing in a bad way… It's humanizing to know that even a perfect friend like Sungguk has weaknesses. Usually, he looks and acts like an old soul, but he's completely weak in romance. Isn't that too human?\\" \\"Sungguk is weak in practical romance. No, actually, Sungguk has no experience in practical romance.\\" \\"Mark, you're not one to talk….\\" I quickly teased Mark. Mark gulped down his beer and then spoke firmly. \\"I've found someone I like.\\" [Not surprising at all.] Mark was quick to fall in love. Dennis wasn't surprised either. \\"Did you give up on Jessie?\\" \\"Yeah. Jessie seems too high a hurdle for me. Well, if Jessie liked me, who knows.\\" [Dream on, Mark.] \\"So, who is it?\\" Dennis urged. \\"How about Michelle?\\" [Michelle! The Michelle I know? This guy really has a knack for stepping on landmines. Tsk tsk tsk.] I inwardly clicked my tongue. The Michelle Jonah who connected Dennis to the Manhattan Music School today was the one in question. This meant Dennis and Michelle Jonah had been in personal contact. I quickly glanced at Dennis. He looked taken aback. [I may not know romance, but I'm quick-witted. You need to be sharp to survive when you're born into poverty.] Mark excitedly talked about Michelle. \\"I met her because of the Ellen Winfrey Show, but Michelle… she's very, you know, straightforward. And she doesn't look down on us for being young… I think we could really get along.\\" \\"You think you could get along, not that you do?\\" I asked, and Mark nodded vigorously. I glanced at Dennis. \\"Dennis, don't you have anything to say? I hate it when friends get tangled up over romantic interests.\\" \\"Ah, that's….\\" Dennis awkwardly started to speak, then looked at Mark. \\"Mark, actually, Michelle and I have been in frequent contact.\\" \\"…Oh… Really?\\" Mark's eyes wavered. [He's shaken.] I leaned back, crossing my arms. [This is something the involved parties should resolve.] Dennis scratched his head a few times, then began to explain to Mark. \\"Honestly, we haven't said we're dating or anything like that. But I think there's a definite mutual interest. We agreed to meet before I head to Harvard tomorrow.\\" \\"Of course, you first tried to see if she wanted to meet to talk about us, right? But Michelle wanted to meet just the two of you, right? How's my guess?\\" \\"Spot on.\\" Dennis smiled shyly, his shoulders lifting slightly. \\"Dennis, I may not know about romance, but I'm quick-witted, right?\\" \\"Yeah, I'll give you that.\\" Dennis grinned. \\"Dennis, congratulations on being the first among us to escape being single!\\" \\"Thanks.\\" I turned to look at Mark, who had collapsed on the bed, asleep. [Sigh, now I have one more person to look after besides my family. Tsk tsk tsk.] I shook my head."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[엄마 이야기 나오면 또 약해지는데….] 나는 졸린 눈을 비비며 침대에서 일어났다. “마크 데리고 갈게요.” 툭. 전화를 끊고 시계를 봤다. 벌써 10시였다. 욕실에서 데니스가 면도까지 하고 말끔한 얼굴로 나왔다. 누가 봐도 데이트 가는 남자의 모습이었다. 근데 마크가 안 보였다. “데니스, 마크 어디 갔어?” “아침에 우울한 얼굴로 센트럴파크 좀 걸어야겠다고 나갔어. 자기도 뉴요커가 돼보고 싶다나 뭐라나.” “실연의 아픔을 달래러 갔구나.” 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어나서 후드 티를 살폈다. “데니스, 내 후드 티가 너무 낡았나?” “그것보다 성국아, 네가 너무 빨리 자라는 거 같아. 옷들이 계속 작아지는 느낌이야.” “원래 10대 때는 다 이러는 거잖아.” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 키는 이제 175cm 정도 된 것 같았다. * * * 그레이스가 환한 미소로 나와 마크를 맞이했다. “오늘 하버드로 돌아간다며?” “네.” “데니스란 그 친구는 먼저 간 거야?” “약속이 있어서요.” 마크는 데니스 이야기만 나오면 괜히 딴청을 피웠다. “내가 뉴욕 온 김에 옷 좀 사줄 테니까, 제발 옷 좀 신경 써. 성국.” “전 이게 편한데요. 마크, 그렇게 이상해?” “성국, 나도 너만큼 옷에 관심 없잖아.” [나는 의도된 거고, 너는 진짜 관심 없는 거지.] 그레이스가 백화점 안으로 먼저 들어갔다. “그레이스, 전 그냥 후드 티면 좋을 거 같아요. 수업 다니기에 너무 편하거든요.” “어쩔 수 없네. 우선 오늘은 당장 입을 거 몇 개 사고… 내가 치수 알아놓고 사서 보낼 테니까, 옷에 제발 신경 좀 써.” “네.” 나는 어쩔 수 없이 대답했다. “참, 그레이스… 피터 어떤 사람 같아요?” “신중하고 좋은 사람 같았어.” “그쵸?” “성국아, 너는 내 연애보다는 네 연애를 먼저 신경 써야 할 거 같지 않아?” “전 열두 살이잖아요.” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 그리고 한 브랜드에 들어가서 눈앞에 보이는 회색 후드 티 세 장과 데님 두 종류를 집었다. 그레이스가 머리를 절레절레 흔들었다. “정말, 그거면 돼?” “네, 그레이스.” [그레이스, 앞으로 사람들은 전성국 하면 이 회색 후드 티에 데님을 떠올리게 된다고. 난 다 계획이 있는 거야.] * * * 데이먼 윙클이 아들인 캐머런과 타일러에게 불같이 화를 내고 있었다. “피터와 계약 조건을 조율 중이라고 들었다. 대체 너희들은 뭘 한 거야?” “저희는….” 캐머런이 얼버무렸다. “라이언 클럽에 초대까지 해놓고, 성국이란 아이랑은 어떤 진척도 없었잖아. 유리하게 프로젝트를 끌어오겠다고 하더니, 대체 여태까지 너희들이 한 게 뭐야?” “성국은 처음부터 저희를 경계하는 것 같았어요. 저희가 의도적으로 접근했다고 생각하는 것 같기도 했고요.” 데이먼은 화난 얼굴로 서류를 검토했다. “피터가 내건 조건을 알아보긴 할 텐데….” “아버지, 천천히 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 접근하는 건 어떨까요?” 타일러가 재빨리 이야기를 꺼냈다. “피터가 이미 초기 투자자로 나섰으니깐, ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 정말 가치 있는 기업인지 아닌지 판명 날 때까지 저희는 지켜보는 거죠. 만약 2, 3년 후에도 ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 성장하고 있다면 그때 투자자가 더 필요할 거잖아요. 피터 혼자서 감당할 수 없는 시기가 분명 올 거예요.” “그때를 노리자고?” “네. 그때까지 저랑 캐머런은 성국이든 마크든 꼬셔놓을게요.” “더 좋은 건 둘의 분열이라는 걸 명심해라.” “네, 아버지.” * * * 데니스의 ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 드디어 연애 중으로 바뀌었다. 축하의 댓글이 미친 듯이 달렸다. “데니스, 축하해. 내 망언은 다 잊어줘.” 마크도 진심으로 축하를 전했다. 1학년 1학기. 하버드도 연애 중 모드로 많은 이들이 바뀌고 있었다. 물론 예외는 있었다. 나와 마크. 나는 안 하는 거였고, 마크는 못 하는 거라는 커다란 차이점이 존재했다. “성국아, 수업 들으러 가자.” “그래.” 나는 졸린 눈을 비비며 책을 집어 들었다. 요즘 나의 스케줄은 살인적이라고 해도 무방했다. 하버드 수업 일정을 쫓아가면서 마크와 함께 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 업그레이드를 진행했고, 데니스와 틈틈이 <채찍>의 시나리오 회의를 했다. “성국, 너 요즘 몸이 열 개라도 부족한 거 아니야?” “부족해. 정말 부족해.” [에너지 넘치는 10대라도 이 스케줄을 소화하긴 무리라고.] 나는 하품을 쩍 했다. 마크도 옆에서 연신 하품을 했다. “성국, 우리 창업과 하버드 공부를 병행할 수 있을까?” “나도 그게 의문이긴 해.” “난 솔직히 학교 그만두고 싶은데, 부모님이 반대하실 것 같아서 더 그래.” [한국이나 미국이나 부모님들의 마음은 다 똑같군.] 나는 다시 하품을 하며 책을 펼쳤다. “마크. 피터와의 계약이 정리되면 정식으로 고민해보자.” “그러자.” 마크도 연신 하품을 해댔다. 제시가 오랜만에 우리 앞에 얼굴을 드러냈다. “둘 다 왜 이렇게 죽어가는 거야?” “안녕, 제시.” 마크는 이제 제시를 봐도 예전처럼 찐따 짓을 하지 않았다. 그건 제시에게서 마음이 떠났다는 의미였다. “성국, 마크. 이번 할로윈 파티 때는 얼굴 보는 거지?” [벌써 할로윈이었던가.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “성국, 대학 1학년의 할로윈 파티는 특별하잖아.” 제시가 졸린 나와 마크를 설득했다. “알았어, 제시. 마크랑 다 같이 갈게.” “그날 난 마를린 먼로로 코스프레할 거야. 성국, 뭐로 할 거야?” [아, 귀찮아.] 하지만 이미 간다고 말해놓은 상황이다. “난, 아이언맨. 마크 넌?” “그럼 난 스파이더맨.” “마크, 멋진데!” “성국, 너도! 아이언맨 엄청 기대된다.” 마크와 내가 너드처럼 킥킥거리며 웃으니까, 제시가 한심한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 너무 마크랑 붙어 다니더니 마크처럼 되는 거 아니야?” [그거 지금 욕이지?] 순간 정신이 번쩍 들었다. “암튼 그날 봐.” 제시는 휭하니 사라졌다. 마크가 걱정스러운 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 제시한테 너무한 거 아니야?” “무슨 소리야?” “제시가 널 좋아하는 거야 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 하는 애들은 다 안다고. 네가 글 올리면 가장 먼저 반응하는 사람이 제시잖아. 근데 넌 맨날 제시한테 철벽을 치잖아.” “마크, 난 아직 어린애야. 제시도 얼른 또래의 좋은 남자를 만나야지.” “또. 애늙은이처럼 이야기한다. 그나저나 너 진짜 아이언맨으로 나타날 거야?” “응.” 나는 단호하게 고개를 끄덕였다. [재벌 시절에 말이야. 내가 대한민국 재계의 아이언맨이었단 말, 했던가. 캬아, 그때 정말 죽여줬었지. 진짜 내 마음대로 다 휘두르고 살았다고. 그러고 보니 심장 안 좋은 것도 비슷하네.] 나는 씁쓸한 웃음을 지었다. * * * 피터가 보내온 계약서를 검수했다. 효진 그룹의 변호사가 검수한 바로도 특별한 독소 조항은 없었다. 전적으로 나와 마크의 공동 경영을 인정한다는 내용도 있었고, 초기 3년 동안 투자를 약속했다. 수익의 배분율은 다른 사모펀드보다 훨씬 양호한 수준이었다. “마크 어때?” “난 좋은 거 같아. 근데 성국아. 진짜 우리 이제부터 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 매진해야 하지 않을까 하는 생각이 계속 드네.” 마크는 원래 하나밖에 모르는 성격이었다. “흠. 나도 그렇긴 해. 마크, 솔직히 이야기할게. 난 만약 ‘페이스 페이퍼’가 처절하게 실패한다고 해도 아직도 10대일 거야. 그때 하버드에 다시 돌아오거나, 나는 한국으로 들어가서 다른 일을 해도 돼. 하지만 너는 20대를 날릴 수 있는 거잖아.” “인생을 걸지 않으면 성공도 할 수 없는 거잖아.” 마크를 만난 이후로 처음으로 마크가 멋있어 보였다. “마크, 멋있는데?” “나도 가끔은 멋있을 때가 있어야지.” “마크, 그럼 우리 이렇게 하자. 계약을 조율하고 모든 계약이 끝나면 아마 거의 겨울방학 직전일 거야. 겨울방학을 인생의 마지막 휴가라 여기고 서로 실컷 놀고 와서 3월부터 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올인하는 거 어떨까? 피터에게도 우리의 계획을 미리 말해둘게.” “그래. 성국, 우리 한번 인생을 걸어보자.” 마크도 단단히 결심을 한 모양이었다. “근데 성국. 너 아이언맨 의상 샀어?” “어, 아마조네스에서 시켰어.” “왜 그걸 이제야 말해!” “스파이더맨 안 시켰어?” “지금 시키면 할로윈 파티 전까지 올까?” “떠들 시간에 어서 주문해! 마크.” 마크는 득달같이 노트북을 열고 스파이더맨 의상을 시켰다. * * * 2003년 10월 31일. 삼전 전자의 주식은 계속 순항 중이었고, 아마조네스도 마찬가지였다. 그사이 난 아플과 나이스 운동화 회사의 주식까지 보유해서 2007년 리먼 사태 이전까지 누구나 부러워하는 증권 포트폴리오를 가진 셈이었다. 드르륵. 드르륵. 드르륵. 핸드폰이 울렸다. 아빠였다. [돈 든다고 전화 잘 안 하시는데, 웬일이지?] 나는 전화를 받았다. “아빠! 어쩐 일이세요?” - 성국아, 잘 지내? “네, 아빠. 겨울방학에 들어가서 상의드릴 일이 많아요.” - 저번에 엘렌 윈프리 쇼 나온 거 봤어. 겨우 30달러로 그렇게 한 달 동안 먹고 너 몸 상한 건 아니지? “저 괜찮아요. 그 일로 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 투자도 성사됐고, 마크랑 조만간 창업할 거 같아요.” - 그래, 효진 그룹 담당 변호사에게 이야기 많이 들었어. 아빠가 전화한 건 말이다. 네가 사둔 판교 지역이 대대적으로 개발에 들어간다고 하더구나. 2003년 하반기이니 한창 그럴 시기이긴 했다. - 평당 400만 원까지 거래가 된다고 하는구나. 판교는 이때 미친 듯이 올랐다가 10년간 하락한다. 바로 대한민국도 잃어버린 10년의 부동산 타이밍이 곧 다가오고 있었다. 서민들 아파트야 얼마나 오르락내리락하는지 관심 없었지만, 공장 부지를 매입해야 했기 때문에 땅값에는 민감했다. “아빠, 다 파셔서 제가 말하는 두 지역에 땅을 좀 사두세요.” - 땅 판 돈 전부로 다시 땅을 사라고? “네, 아빠. 마곡과 동탄 두 지역이요. 판교 땅 팔아서 딱 반반씩 마곡과 동탄 지역에 땅을 사두세요.” - 어, 그러마. 성국아, 아빠가 걱정돼서 하는 말인데. 너무 무리하지 마. 알았지? “어엉, 아빠.” 오랜만에 아빠의 목소리를 들으니 감정이 복받쳐 올라왔다. 나는 이를 꽉 깨물었다. 이때, 뒤에서 지희의 목소리가 들렸다. - 오빠, 지희예요. 오빠, 잘 지내? 그 순간, 코끝이 찡해졌다. 저번 생에서는 동생들이 그렇게 귀찮았는데…. 암튼 이번 생에서는 좀 감성이 풍부한 몸에 태어난 건 맞는 것 같았다. - 오빠, 언제 와? “겨울 방학에 갈게. 조금만 기다려, 지희야.” - 오빠 오면 포옥 안아줄게. [이래서 다들 딸바보, 여동생바보가 되는구나.] 나는 찡해진 코끝을 슥슥 문지르곤 얼른 대답했다. “응. 지희야. 오빠가 얼른 보러 갈게.”","completion":"Episode 110 Early in the morning, I received a call from Grace. \\"Hello.\\" I was out of it, having fallen asleep after discussing a new screenplay with Dennis until dawn. - Sungguk, are you still sleeping? \\"Grace, sorry for leaving early yesterday.\\" - No, thanks to you, I had a lot of talks with Peter and it seems like I made a good friend in New York. \\"That's good.\\" - Before you leave, I was thinking of going to the department store... What time is your flight? \\"It's at 4 PM.\\" - Then, can you come to the department store by 12? Seeing you yesterday, you only had hoodies. And they were even on the verge of becoming too small... \\"Grace, I don't need clothes.\\" [Grace, I believe my face compensates for my clothes...] But Grace was firm. - Sungguk, how would a mother feel if her son roams around Harvard looking like that? [I always get weak when it comes to talking about mom...] I rubbed my sleepy eyes and got out of bed. \\"I'll bring Mark.\\" Thud. I hung up the phone and looked at the time. It was already 10 AM. Dennis came out of the bathroom with a clean-shaven face, looking ready for a date. He looked like a man going on a date, no doubt. But Mark was nowhere to be seen. \\"Dennis, where did Mark go?\\" \\"He said he felt down this morning and went for a walk in Central Park. He wanted to try being a New Yorker or something.\\" \\"He went to soothe the pain of heartbreak.\\" I jumped out of bed and grabbed my hoodie. \\"Dennis, is my hoodie too worn out?\\" \\"More than that, Sungguk, it seems like you're growing too fast. It feels like your clothes are getting smaller.\\" \\"It's normal for teenagers.\\" I shrugged. I seemed to be around 175cm tall now. * * * Grace greeted Mark and me with a bright smile. \\"You're returning to Harvard today?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Did that friend Dennis leave first?\\" \\"He had an appointment.\\" Mark always acted indifferent whenever Dennis was mentioned. \\"Since I'm in New York, let me buy you some clothes, please take care of your appearance, Sungguk.\\" \\"I'm comfortable with this. Mark, do I look weird?\\" \\"Sungguk, I'm not interested in clothes either.\\" [I do it on purpose, you're genuinely uninterested.] Grace entered the department store first. \\"Grace, I think a hoodie would be fine. It's very comfortable for attending classes.\\" \\"No choice then. Let's buy a few things you can wear right away... I'll get your size and send you more clothes, so please pay attention to your appearance.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I had no choice but to agree. \\"By the way, Grace... What do you think of Peter?\\" \\"He seemed cautious and nice.\\" \\"Right?\\" \\"Sungguk, shouldn't you be more concerned about your own love life rather than mine?\\" \\"I'm only twelve.\\" I shrugged. Then, I entered a brand store and picked up three gray hoodies and two types of denim that caught my eye. Grace shook her head in disbelief. \\"Really, that's it?\\" \\"Yes, Grace.\\" [Grace, in the future, when people think of Jeon Sungguk, they'll think of this gray hoodie and denim. I have a plan.] * * * Damon Winkle was furiously scolding his sons, Cameron and Tyler. \\"I heard you're negotiating a contract with Peter. What exactly have you guys done?\\" \\"We...,\\" Cameron stammered. \\"You even invited him to the Ryan Club, but there's been no progress with that kid Sungguk. You said you'd bring the project to our advantage, but what have you done so far?\\" \\"Sungguk seemed wary of us from the start. He might have thought we were approaching him on purpose.\\" Damon reviewed the documents with an angry face. \\"I'll look into the conditions Peter has offered...\\" \\"Father, how about we approach 'Face Paper' slowly?\\" Tyler quickly suggested. \\"Since Peter has already become an initial investor, let's see if 'Face Paper' is truly a valuable company or not. If 'Face Paper' is still growing in 2, 3 years, they'll need more investors by then. There will definitely come a time when Peter can't handle it alone.\\" \\"Are we aiming for that time?\\" \\"Yes. Until then, Cameron and I will try to win over Sungguk or Mark.\\" \\"Remember, their division would be even better.\\" \\"Yes, Father.\\" * * * Dennis's 'Face Paper' finally changed to being in a relationship. Congratulations comments were pouring in like crazy. \\"Dennis, congratulations. Forget all my nonsense.\\" Mark also sincerely congratulated him. First semester of freshman year. Many at Harvard were switching to relationship mode. Of course, there were exceptions. Me and Mark. I wasn't doing it, and Mark couldn't do it, which was a significant difference. \\"Sungguk, let's go to class.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I rubbed my sleepy eyes and picked up my book. My schedule these days could be described as murderous. I was keeping up with Harvard classes, upgrading 'Face Paper' with Mark, and occasionally discussing the screenplay of <Whip> with Dennis. \\"Sungguk, don't you think you need ten bodies to keep up with your schedule?\\" \\"I do. I really do.\\" [Even an energetic teenager would struggle to keep up with this schedule.] I yawned widely. Mark yawned continuously beside me. \\"Sungguk, can we really manage both a startup and Harvard studies?\\" \\"I'm wondering that too.\\" \\"Honestly, I want to quit school, but my parents would oppose it.\\" [Whether in Korea or America, parents' hearts are all the same.] I yawned again and opened my book. \\"Mark. Once the contract with Peter is settled, which will probably be right before winter break, let's consider it as our last vacation and have fun. Then, from March, we'll go all-in on 'Face Paper.' I'll talk to Peter about our plan in advance.\\" \\"Let's do that.\\" Mark yawned continuously. Jessie showed up in front of us after a long time. \\"Why do you both look like you're dying?\\" \\"Hi, Jessie.\\" Mark no longer acted like a nerd around Jessie. It meant his feelings for her had moved on. \\"Sungguk, Mark. You're showing up at the Halloween party, right?\\" [Was it already Halloween?] I shrugged. \\"Sungguk, the Halloween party in your freshman year is special.\\" Jessie persuaded the sleepy me and Mark. \\"Okay, Jessie. Mark and I will go together.\\" \\"What will you dress up as? I'll be Marilyn Monroe. Sungguk, what about you?\\" [Ah, so bothersome.] But I had already said I would go. \\"I'll be Iron Man. Mark, you?\\" \\"Then I'll be Spider-Man.\\" \\"Mark, that's cool!\\" \\"Sungguk, you too! I'm really looking forward to Iron Man.\\" Mark and I giggled nerdily, and Jessie looked at me with a pitiful face. \\"Sungguk, you're spending too much time with Mark. Aren't you becoming like him?\\" [Was that an insult?] I suddenly snapped back to reality. \\"Anyway, see you then.\\" Jessie disappeared in a flash. Mark looked at me with worried eyes. \\"Sungguk, aren't you being too harsh on Jessie?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Everyone in 'Face Paper' knows Jessie likes you. She's the first to react whenever you post something. But you always put up a wall against her.\\" \\"Mark, I'm still a kid. Jessie should find a good guy her age.\\" \\"You sound like an old soul again. Anyway, are you really going to show up as Iron Man?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded firmly. [Back in my billionaire days, did I ever say I was the Iron Man of Korea's business world? Ah, those were the days. I really ruled everything. Now that I think about it, even having a bad heart is similar.] I smiled bitterly. * * * I reviewed the contract sent by Peter. The lawyer in charge at Hyojin Group had also reviewed it and found no particularly harmful clauses. It fully recognized mine and Mark's joint management and promised investment for the initial three years. The distribution of profits was much more favorable than other private equity funds. \\"Mark, what do you think?\\" \\"It seems good to me. But Sungguk, honestly, I think we should really dedicate ourselves to 'Face Paper' from now on.\\" Mark was always single-minded. \\"Mark, you look cool.\\" \\"I should look cool once in a while.\\" \\"Mark, let's do this. Let's negotiate the contract and once everything is settled, it'll almost be right before winter break. Let's treat the winter break as our last vacation, have a blast, and then go all-in on 'Face Paper' from March. I'll talk to Peter about our plan in advance.\\" \\"Let's do that. Sungguk, let's bet our lives on this.\\" Mark seemed to have made a firm decision. \\"But Sungguk, did you buy the Iron Man costume?\\" \\"Yeah, I ordered it from Amazon.\\" \\"Why didn't you tell me sooner!\\" \\"Didn't you order Spider-Man?\\" \\"Will it arrive before the Halloween party if I order it now?\\" \\"Instead of chatting, hurry up and order! Mark.\\" Mark quickly opened his laptop and ordered the Spider-Man costume. * * * October 31, 2003. Samsung Electronics' stock was still sailing smoothly, and so was Amazon. In the meantime, I had also acquired stocks in Apple and Nike, creating a portfolio envied by many until the 2007 Lehman crisis. Drrrk. Drrrk. Drrrk. My phone rang. It was Dad. [I wonder why he's calling, he usually doesn't call when he's making money.] I answered the phone. \\"Dad! What's up?\\" - Sungguk, are you doing well? \\"Yes, Dad. I have a lot to discuss with you during winter break.\\" - I saw you on the Ellen Winfrey Show last time. You managed to survive a month on just 30. You didn't hurt yourself, did you? \\"I'm fine. That incident led to an investment in 'Face Paper,' and it looks like Mark and I will be starting a business soon.\\" - I've heard a lot from the lawyer in charge at Hyojin Group. I called because... The area in Pangyo you bought is going into major development. It was the second half of 2003, so it was about time for that. - They say transactions are reaching up to 4 million won per square meter. Pangyo's prices soared insanely at this time and then fell for the next 10 years. It was the beginning of Korea's lost decade in real estate. I wasn't interested in how much the apartments for the common people fluctuated, but I was sensitive to land prices because I had to buy factory sites. \\"Dad, sell all of it and buy land in two areas I'll tell you about.\\" - Use all the money from selling the land to buy more land? \\"Yes, Dad. Magok and Dongtan. Sell the Pangyo land and buy land in Magok and Dongtan equally.\\" - Alright. Sungguk, Dad is worried about you. Don't overdo it, okay? \\"Uh-huh, Dad.\\" Hearing Dad's voice after a long time made me emotional. I clenched my teeth. Then, Jihee's voice came from behind. - Brother, it's Jihee. Are you doing well? At that moment, my nose tingled. In my previous life, my siblings were so annoying... Anyway, it seems I was born into a body with rich emotions this time around. - Brother, when are you coming? \\"I'll come during winter break. Just wait a little, Jihee.\\" - I'll give you a big hug when you come. [So this is why people become daughter-obsessed, sister-obsessed.] I rubbed my tingling nose and quickly replied. \\"Okay, Jihee. I'll come to see you soon.\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[정말 이런 20대 파티는 내 취향 아닌데. 술도 싸구려고. 음료도 저질이고. 하아.] 나는 한숨을 푹푹 내쉬며 구석으로 숨어들었다. 이때, 누가 봐도 윙클 형제 중 한 명으로 보이는 사람이 나에게로 다가왔다. 금발에 저 떡대. 거기다 저 키의 하버드 대학생은 흔치 않았다. [오른쪽 입꼬리에 점이 있는 게 캐머런이니까….] 내게 다가오는 건 타일러였다. 캐머런과 타일러는 많이 닮았지만, 성격은 좀 달랐다. 타일러가 좀 더 계산적이고 똑똑했지만 그런 모습이 겉으로 보여서 친구들은 많지 않았다. 그에 비해 캐머런은 성격 좋은 부잣집 도련님 같았다. 능력은 별로 없지만, 성격 좋아서 친구가 많은 그런 타입이었다. 지금 타일러가 내게 접근하고 있단 것은 뭔가 계산된 일이 있는 게 분명했다. 타일러가 날 보며 빙긋 웃었다. “마크, 맞지?” [이런, 어쩌지.] * * * 1시간 전. 아이언맨 복장을 한 나와 마크는 서로를 바라보다가 재미있는 내기를 떠올렸다. “마크, 우리 이 복장으로 할로윈 파티 간다고 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 올리고는 서로 바꿔 입고 가는 게 어때?” “성국, 천재인데! 그럼 사람들은 아이언맨 복장을 한 나를 너로 착각할 거잖아.” “그렇다고 이상한 짓 하면 절대 안 돼!” “알았어. 이 기회에 나도 여자들에게 인기남 좀 되어보고 좋지.” 마크는 대찬성했다. 우리는 얼른 옷을 바꿔 입고 데니스 앞에 섰다. “데니스, 우리 구분돼?” “와, 머리까지 다 감추니까 전혀 모르겠어.” 아직 무럭무럭 자라는 중인 나와 마크는 키가 얼추 비슷했다. 내가 몇 달 사이에 마크를 조금 추월하긴 했지만, 눈에 띄는 정도는 아니었다. “마크, 문제가 있어. 스파이더맨 쫄쫄이잖아!” “성국, 네가 먼저 제안한 거야. 난 아이언맨 슈트 너무 좋아.” “바지 어디 있어, 바지!” 나는 얼른 바지를 입었다. 뭔가 어정쩡했지만, 졸라맨으로 할로윈 파티에 갈 순 없었다. 데니스가 우리를 보고 소리쳤다. “자, 나를 봐주세요.” 찰칵. 찰칵. 그렇게 나와 마크는 서로 의상을 교체해서 입고 할로윈 파티장으로 향했다. 마크는 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 내가 아이언맨으로 등장할 거라고 했으니, 여자들에게 엄청 많은 대시를 받을 거라고 기대했다. [마크 덕분에 파티를 조용히 즐길 수 있겠네.] 나는 오히려 그 반대였다. * * * 타일러의 등장에 나는 잠시 주춤했다. 말을 하면 분명 나인지 알아챌 것 같아서 나는 작게 고개를 끄덕였다. 다행인 건 음악이 미친 듯이 흘러나오고 있어서 말소리가 제대로 들리지 않는다는 사실이었다. 거기다 난 스파이더맨 복장이라 입까지 쫄쫄이가 점령하고 있었다. 나는 손을 들어 타일러를 반겼다. “마크, 혼자야?” “응.” 나는 작게 말하며 고개를 끄덕였다. 타일러는 내게 오더니 슬쩍 귓가에 속삭이기 시작했다. “마크, 피터한테 성국이 투자받기로 했다던데. 맞지?” “응.” [역시 다른 꿍꿍이가 있었군.] “계약 조건 잘 살핀 거야? 혹시 너한테 불리한 조항이 있는 거 아니야?” “어?” 나는 일부러 좀 놀란 척하며 타일러를 쳐다봤다. “피터가 유명한 투자의 신이긴 하지만, 비즈니스는 모두 성국 담당이잖아. 성국이를 너무 믿지 마. 피터랑 이면 계약서를 썼을 수도 있잖아.” [이럴 계획이었구나.] 나는 잠자코 타일러의 말을 들었다. “솔직히 개발은 네가 다 한 거잖아. 성국은 얼굴마담이고. 근데 너랑 성국이 똑같은 지분을 가지고 있다는 게 말이 돼?” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “그냥. 우리 생각은 그렇다고. 라이언 클럽에 널 못 초대한 것도 네가 개발자란 사실을 성국이 전혀 말 안 해서 우리는 몰랐다니까.” [나와 마크를 이렇게 이간질시키려고 한 거구나.] 나는 조금 놀란 얼굴로 타일러를 쳐다봤다. 타일러는 조금 더 가까이 귓가에 속삭였다. “마크, 우리 아버지가 유명한 사모펀드 운영자야. 너와 함께 언제든지 계약을 유리하게 조정해줄 수 있단 것만 기억해줘. 이건 우리 아버지 명함이야.” 나는 타일러가 건넨 명함을 받아 들었다. “그럼, 연락 줘.” “응.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 다행히 정신없는 할로윈 파티 음악과 짧은 대답으로 위기는 모면했다. 나는 타일러가 건넨 명함을 바라봤다. 만약 마크가 이 명함을 받았으면 어떻게 했을까? [근데 마크 어디 있지?] 이때였다. “와아아아!” 환호 소리가 들렸다. 그리고 난 믿을 수 없는 광경을 보고 있었다. 아이언맨이 테이블 위에 올라가 막춤을 추고 있었다. 유일하게 나와 마크가 옷을 바꿔 입은 것을 아는 데니스가 웃으며 디지털카메라로 촬영 중이었다. 정말 마크의 막춤은 최악이었다. 제시가 웃으면서 내게 다가왔다. “마크, 성국이 오늘 단단히 마음먹었나 봐.” “그러게.” “마크, 성국이 막춤 덕분에 여자애들 많이 떨어져 나가겠어.” [마크, 저 자식을.] 나는 주먹을 불끈 쥐었다. * * * “푸하하하! 성국, 나 오늘 너무 너무 신났어. 나 춤춘 거 봤어?” 나는 침대에 앉아 로댕의 생각하는 사람처럼 심각하게 고뇌에 빠져 있었다. 마크의 막춤, 그러니까 마크가 추고 사람들은 내가 추는 것으로 아는 그 막춤이 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 휩쓸고 있었다. “성국, 진정해. 화난 거야?” “화난 게 아니라 좌절한 거지. 어서 사진 찍어서 올리자.” “그렇게 금방 올리면 재미없잖아. 내일 아침에 올리자. 오늘 하루 동안은 그래도 사람들이 성국이 막춤을 춘 줄 알 거잖아. 와, 엄청 재미나다.” 마크는 신이 나서 종알거렸다. 나는 한숨을 푹푹 내쉬었다. “성국, 실망하지 마. 내가 그 막춤을 추고 테이블에서 내려왔는데도 불구하고 나한테 전화번호를 준 여자들이 이렇게나 많아.” 마크는 손에 쥔 연락처를 책상 위에 올려놨다. “그래, 마크. 하루라도 즐거웠다니 다행이야.” “근데 넌 재미있는 일 없었어, 성국?” “있었어.” 나는 타일러가 내민 명함을 마크에게 건넸다. “데이먼 윙클? 타일러, 캐머런 형제랑 성이 같네.” “응. 그 쌍둥이 아버지가 운영하는 사모펀드야. 오늘 나에게 타일러가 다가왔었어.” “진짜? 그럼 나인 줄 알고 다가간 거겠네?” “응.” 나는 무겁게 고개를 끄덕였다. 내 눈치를 보더니 마크가 심상치 않은 일이라는 것을 눈치채곤 차분히 물었다. “뭐 이상한 제안이라도 했어?” “마크, 솔직히 물을게. 진심으로 이야기해 줬으면 좋겠어. 이건 앞으로 우리 동업에 있어서 굉장히 중요한 일이거든.” “응. 알았어.” 마크는 고개를 끄덕였다. “마크, 너는 내가 너보다 더 주목받는 게 혹시 마음에 걸려?” “그게 무슨 소리야?” “나는 아이디어를 냈지만, 개발자는 너잖아.” “그 아이디어가 굉장히 중요한 거고, 너도 나한테 프로그램 배워서 많이 도와주잖아. 그리고 비즈니스는 네가 다 하잖아. 솔직히 보딩스쿨에서부터 시작해서 하버드까지 ‘페이스 페이퍼’ 가입자가 는 건 다 네 인기 덕분이잖아. 난 진짜 아무렇지도 않아.” 마크는 제법 진지했다. “처음엔 나도 개발자인데, 사람들이 너무 안 알아주는 것 같아서 좀 서운하기도 했어. 하지만 너도 날 최선을 다해서 소개했고, 사람들이 내가 ‘페이스 페이퍼’를 만든 공동 개발자라는 거 많이 알아. 너보다 내가 스타성이 없는 건 사실이잖아.” “솔직히 말해줘서 고마워, 마크.” 나는 파티장에서 있었던 일을 마크에게 짧게 이야기했다. “타일러가 우리를 이간질하려고 하더라고. 너만 빼가려고 작전을 수정한 것 같아.” “말도 안 돼.” [그렇지. 말도 안 되지. 우린 이미 계약으로 꽁꽁 묶인 상태잖아.] 윙클 형제는 아마 우리가 개발 초창기부터 계약서를 썼다는 사실은 생각지도 못했을 것이다. 마크는 내 흉내 내느라 못 마신 맥주를 들이켰다. “성국, 그건 전혀 걱정하지 마. ‘페이스 페이퍼’는 우리 둘이 만든 거고, 둘 중에 한 명이 빠진다면 아무 의미도 없어.” 마크는 단호하게 이야기했다. “마크, 요즘 점점 멋있어지는 거 같은데?” “그치? 성국. 나 요즘 명언집 엄청 읽어.” [그럼 그렇지. 사람 안 변해.] 내가 고개를 흔들자, 마크가 웃어댔다. “성국, 우리 이 관계 절대 변하지 말자.” [그건 내가 할 소리야, 마크. 너, 나 배신하면 지구 끝까지 쫓아가서 복수할 거야.] 나는 유쾌하게 웃었다. “당연하지, 마크.” 달칵. 기숙사 문 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 데니스가 양철 나무꾼 가슴에 빨간 하트를 붙이고 들어왔다. “미셸이 일이 바빠서 좀 전에 갔어.” “데니스, 드디어 양철 나무꾼도 심장을 찾은 거야?” “응. 완전 팔딱팔딱 뛰어. 근데 성국, 막춤 진실은 언제 공개할 거야?” “내일 아침에 하려고 하는데, 어때?” “자정에 하자. 마치 신데렐라처럼.” 역시 예술가다운 발상이었다. 데니스가 카메라를 들고 우리 앞에 섰다. 우린 둘 다 아직 스파이더맨과 아이언맨 차림이었다. “둘 다 다시 가면을 쓰고, 내가 카메라로 촬영을 시작하면 가면을 벗는 거야. 알았지?” 나와 마크는 다시 가면을 썼다. 나는 스파이더맨. 마크는 아이언맨으로 돌아갔다. “하나, 둘, 셋 하면 벗는 거야. 하나, 둘, 셋!” 동시에 나와 마크는 가면을 벗어서 뒤로 던졌다. * * * 밤 12시 정각. 나와 마크는 각자의 ‘페이스 페이퍼’에 사진을 올렸다. - 오늘 막춤을 춘 사람은 제가 아니라 마크였어요! 내가 올린 글에 미친 듯이 글이 달리기 시작했다. 마크의 ‘페이스 페이퍼’도 터져 나가고 있었다. “성국, 나한테 번호 준 여자들이 죄다 너한테 번호 좀 전해달래. 이런 말도 있어. 막춤 추는 거 보고 실망했는데, 아니어서 다행이라고.” “마크, 아이언맨이 너무 조용해서 당연히 너인 줄 알았다는 사람도 많아. 내가 그렇게 나대나?” “성국, 몰랐어?” [그저 난 어디 가든 시선 집중이 될 뿐이야.] 데니스도 댓글 읽기에 동참했다. - 스파이더맨이 생수 들고 있을 때, 알아봤어야 하는데…. - 어쩐지 스파이더맨이 몸이 너무 좋더라. “마크, 막춤이 자기 스타일이었다고 연락 달래. 그런데 이름이… 미안. 저스틴이네.” “그만 좀 놀려들!” 다들 웃음을 터트렸다.","completion":"Episode 111 Mark was pacing back and forth in front of me, dressed in a Spider-Man costume. \\"Sung-guk, did you yawn? Why are your eyes so red?\\" \\"Just. I miss my siblings.\\" At my words, Mark looked at me with a face full of disbelief for a while. \\"Really, Sung-guk. You really do seem like you're twelve at times like this.\\" \\"Ji-hee must have grown a lot.\\" \\"Indeed, a brother is still a brother.\\" I blankly stared at the Iron Man cosplay costume. \\"Sung-guk, hurry and put it on. The college freshman Halloween party is only for today.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I put on the Iron Man outfit and held the Iron Man mask in my hand. Soon, the door opened, and Dennis burst in. At a glance, it was clear what Dennis's costume for today was. \\"Dennis, are you the Tin Man from 'The Wizard of Oz'?\\" \\"Yeah. My heart will be brought by Dorothy.\\" \\"That Dorothy is Michelle, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Dennis smiled shyly. Mark put on the Spider-Man mask with envious eyes. \\"I need to find MJ.\\" \\"Sung-guk, you should also find a girlfriend at the party today. Don't just hang out with Mark and me all the time.\\" \\"Iron Man is supposed to be lonely.\\" I put on the Iron Man mask. * * * Jessie, who perfectly recreated the scene where Marilyn Monroe appeared at President Kennedy's birthday and sang the birthday song, opened the door. \\"Everyone, come in.\\" She even imitated Marilyn Monroe's accent, slowing down her speech more than usual. \\"Spider-Man is obviously Mark, and Iron Man is Sung-guk, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" We nodded our heads simultaneously. \\"Alright, everyone, have fun.\\" Then, Michelle, dressed as Dorothy from 'The Wizard of Oz,' appeared from behind. \\"Tin Man, I've brought your heart.\\" \\"Thank you, Dorothy.\\" Dennis and Michelle, the couple, disappeared into the party. And Mark and I also walked into the party. As expected, it was Jessie's Halloween party at Harvard, which was the most popular, so many people were bustling around. [Really, these 20s parties are not my taste. The alcohol is cheap, and the drinks are low quality. Sigh.] I sighed deeply and hid in a corner. Then, a person who was obviously one of the Winklevoss twins approached me. Blond and muscular. A Harvard student of that height was rare. [The one with a mole on the right corner of his mouth is Cameron, so....] The one approaching me was Tyler. Cameron and Tyler looked a lot alike, but their personalities were a bit different. Tyler was more calculating and smart, but because of that, he didn't have many friends. In contrast, Cameron seemed like a nice rich kid. He didn't have much ability, but he was popular because of his good personality. It was clear that Tyler approaching me had some calculated motive. Tyler looked at me and smiled slightly. \\"Mark, right?\\" [Oh no, what do I do.] * * * An hour ago. Mark and I, dressed as Iron Man, looked at each other and came up with a fun bet. \\"Mark, how about we post on 'Face Paper' that we're going to the Halloween party in these costumes but then switch and go?\\" \\"Sung-guk, you're a genius! Then people will mistake me in the Iron Man costume for you.\\" \\"But you absolutely can't do anything weird!\\" \\"Got it. It'll be nice to be popular with the girls for once.\\" Mark was all for it. We quickly changed clothes and stood in front of Dennis. \\"Dennis, can you tell us apart?\\" \\"Wow, with the hair all covered up, I can't tell at all.\\" Mark and I, who were still growing, were about the same height. I had slightly surpassed Mark in the past few months, but it wasn't noticeable. \\"Mark, there's a problem. It's Spider-Man's tight suit!\\" \\"Sung-guk, you suggested it first. I really like the Iron Man suit.\\" \\"Where are the pants, the pants!\\" I quickly put on the pants. It was a bit awkward, but I couldn't go to the Halloween party as a half-dressed man. Dennis shouted at us. \\"Look at me, please.\\" Click. Click. That's how Mark and I switched costumes and headed to the Halloween party. Mark, having announced on 'Face Paper' that I would appear as Iron Man, expected to receive a lot of attention from the girls. [I guess I can enjoy the party quietly thanks to Mark.] I thought the opposite. * * * When Tyler appeared, I hesitated for a moment. Afraid that speaking would give me away, I just nodded slightly. Luckily, the music was blasting so loudly that voices couldn't be heard properly. Plus, I was in a Spider-Man costume, so my mouth was completely covered by the tight fabric. I raised my hand to greet Tyler. \\"Mark, are you alone?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I spoke softly and nodded. Tyler came closer and began whispering in my ear. \\"Mark, I heard Sung-guk is getting investment from Peter. Is that right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" [I knew there was some ulterior motive.] \\"Did you check the contract conditions well? Isn't there any clause that's unfavorable to you?\\" \\"Huh?\\" I pretended to be a bit surprised and looked at Tyler. \\"Peter may be a famous investment god, but business is all Sung-guk's responsibility. Don't trust Sung-guk too much. They might have written a backdoor contract.\\" [So that was the plan.] I listened quietly to Tyler's words. \\"Honestly, you did all the development, right? Sung-guk is just a figurehead. But you and Sung-guk having the same shares, does that make sense?\\" I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Just. That's what we think. You weren't invited to the Ryan Club because Sung-guk didn't mention at all that you were the developer, so we didn't know.\\" [So they were trying to sow discord between me and Mark.] I looked at Tyler with a slightly surprised face. Tyler whispered even closer. \\"Mark, our father is a famous private equity fund manager. Remember, we can renegotiate the contract in your favor anytime. This is our father's business card.\\" I took the business card Tyler handed me. \\"Then, contact me.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded. Luckily, the loud Halloween party music and my short answers helped me avoid the crisis. I looked at the business card Tyler had given me. What would Mark have done if he had received this business card? [But where is Mark?] That's when it happened. \\"Wow!\\" Cheers erupted. And I was witnessing an unbelievable scene. Iron Man was dancing wildly on top of a table. Dennis, the only one who knew Mark and I had switched costumes, was laughing and filming with a digital camera. Truly, Mark's wild dance was the worst. Jessie approached me, laughing. \\"Mark, Sung-guk must have really set his mind to it today.\\" \\"Seems so.\\" \\"Mark, thanks to Sung-guk's wild dance, a lot of girls must have backed off.\\" [Mark, that guy.] I clenched my fist. * * * \\"Puhahaha! Sung-guk, I had so much fun today. Did you see me dancing?\\" I was sitting on the bed, deep in thought like Rodin's The Thinker. Mark's wild dance, or rather, the wild dance that people thought I did, was sweeping through 'Face Paper.' \\"Sung-guk, are you upset?\\" \\"Not upset, just frustrated. Let's quickly take a picture and post it.\\" \\"It's no fun if we post it right away. Let's post it tomorrow morning. For today, people will still think you were the one who danced wildly. Wow, it's so funny.\\" Mark was excitedly chattering away. I sighed deeply. \\"Sung-guk, don't be disappointed. Even after I danced and got off the table, so many girls gave me their phone numbers.\\" Mark placed the contacts he had received on the desk. \\"Well, Mark. It's good that you had fun for a day.\\" \\"But didn't you have any fun, Sung-guk?\\" \\"I did.\\" I handed Mark the business card given by Tyler. \\"Damon Winklevoss? Tyler, Cameron's brother has the same last name.\\" \\"Yeah. That's the private equity fund run by the twins' father. Tyler approached me today.\\" \\"Really? So he thought you were me?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded heavily. Mark, sensing something serious, asked calmly. \\"Did he make any strange offers?\\" \\"Mark, I honestly have a question. I want you to answer sincerely. This is very important for our partnership going forward.\\" \\"Okay. Got it.\\" Mark nodded. \\"Mark, does it bother you that I get more attention than you?\\" \\"What are you talking about?\\" \\"I came up with the idea, but you're the developer.\\" \\"That idea is very important, and you also learned programming to help me a lot. And you handle all the business. Honestly, the reason 'Face Paper' subscribers increased from boarding school to Harvard is all thanks to your popularity. I really don't mind.\\" Mark was quite serious. \\"At first, I felt a bit neglected because I'm the developer, but you introduced me as much as you could, and many people know I'm the co-developer of 'Face Paper.' It's true I don't have the star quality you do.\\" \\"Thanks for being honest, Mark.\\" I briefly told Mark about what happened at the party. \\"Tyler was trying to drive a wedge between us. It seems like he changed his plan to take you away.\\" \\"That's ridiculous.\\" [Right. It's ridiculous. We're already tightly bound by contracts.] The Winklevoss twins probably never thought we had signed contracts from the early development stages. Mark gulped down the beer he hadn't touched while pretending to be me. \\"Sung-guk, don't worry about that at all. 'Face Paper' is something we both created, and if one of us is missing, it means nothing.\\" Mark spoke firmly. \\"Mark, you seem to be getting cooler these days?\\" \\"Right? Sung-guk. I've been reading a lot of quotes lately.\\" [So that's it. People don't change.] As I shook my head, Mark laughed. \\"Sung-guk, let's never change our relationship.\\" [That's my line, Mark. If you betray me, I'll chase you to the ends of the earth for revenge.] I laughed cheerfully. \\"Of course, Mark.\\" Click. The sound of the dormitory door opening was heard. Dennis entered with a red heart stuck on the Tin Man's chest. \\"Michelle had to leave earlier because she was busy.\\" \\"Dennis, did the Tin Man finally find his heart?\\" \\"Yeah. It's beating like crazy. But Sung-guk, when will you reveal the truth about the wild dance?\\" \\"I'm planning to do it tomorrow morning, what do you think?\\" \\"Let's do it at midnight. Like Cinderella.\\" It was indeed an artistic idea. Dennis stood in front of us with a camera. We were both still dressed as Spider-Man and Iron Man. \\"Both of you, put on your masks again, and when I start filming, you take them off. Got it?\\" Mark and I put on our masks again. I was Spider-Man. Mark was Iron Man again. \\"On the count of three, take them off. One, two, three!\\" Simultaneously, Mark and I took off our masks and threw them behind us. * * * At exactly 12 a.m. Mark and I each posted a photo on our 'Face Paper.' - The person who danced wildly today wasn't me, it was Mark! My post started getting crazy comments. Mark's 'Face Paper' was also exploding. \\"Sung-guk, the girls who gave me their numbers are all asking me to pass them to you. There's also this message. They were disappointed seeing the wild dance, but they're relieved it wasn't you.\\" \\"Mark, there are also people who thought it was obvious you were too quiet to be Iron Man. Do I really stand out that much?\\" \\"Didn't you know, Sung-guk?\\" [It seems I'm always the center of attention wherever I go.] Dennis also joined in reading the comments. - When Spider-Man was holding a bottle of water, I should have recognized it.... - No wonder Spider-Man's body looked too good. \\"Mark, someone says your wild dance was their style. But the name is... sorry. It's Justin.\\" \\"Stop teasing me!\\" Everyone burst into laughter."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},C=["disabled"],N={key:0},L={key:1};function F(i,e,l,m,n,s){const p=y("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",j,[(t(!0),o(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(t(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),o("div",R,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
