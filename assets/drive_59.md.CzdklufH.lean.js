This line is known as the radical axis of the circles. 3. **Transformation to Tangent Lines**: - By moving the circles, we can position them such that there are two lines tangent to all three circles. This configuration helps in visualizing the problem as a triangle formed by the centers of the circles with additional constraints due to the tangency. 4. **Bounding the Distances**: - Consider the triangle formed by the centers O_1, O_2, and O_3. The sides of this triangle are d_{12}, d_{13}, and d_{23}. - The sum of the distances between the centers can be related to the sum of the radii by considering the tangency conditions and the properties of the triangle. 5. **Using the Triangle Inequality**: - By the triangle inequality, we have: [ d_{12} + d_{13} geq d_{23}, quad d_{12} + d_{23} geq d_{13}, quad d_{13} + d_{23} geq d_{12} ] - Summing these inequalities, we get: [ 2(d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23}) geq d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23} + d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23} ] [ 2(d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23}) geq 2(d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23}) ] This simplifies to: [ d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23} geq d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23} ] which is trivially true. 6. **Applying the Given Condition**: - Given that every line separating two circles intersects the interior of the third circle, we can infer that the circles are positioned such that the distances between their centers are constrained by their radii. - Specifically, the condition implies that the circles are close enough that the sum of the distances between their centers is bounded by a multiple of the sum of their radii. 7. **Final Bound**: - To find the exact bound, we use the fact that the maximum distance between the centers of two circles that are tangent to a common line is 2sqrt{2} times the sum of their radii. - Therefore, we have: [ d_{12} + d_{13} + d_{23} leq 2sqrt{2}(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) ] Thus, we have shown that the sum of the pairwise distances between the centers of the three circles is at most 2sqrt{2} times the sum of their radii. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Prove that the number of odd numbers in row ( n ) is at most twice the number of switch pairs in row ( n1 ).","completion":"1. **Identify the element relations in Pascal's Triangle:** - Pascal’s Triangle builds each row from the values in the previous row. - The element in row ( n ) and column ( k ), denoted as ( binom{n}{k} ), is given by [ binom{n}{k} = binom{n-1}{k-1} + binom{n-1}{k} ] - Each element is the sum of two adjacent elements in the preceding row. 2. **Understand the parity of sums:** - A number in row ( n ) can be odd if and only if the sum of its two contributing numbers from row ( n-1 ) is odd. - For a sum ((binom{n-1}{k-1} + binom{n-1}{k})) to be odd, the two contributing numbers must have different parities (i.e., one must be even and the other odd). 3. **Define a switch pair:** - A switch pair in row ( n-1 ) is defined as two adjacent elements where one is odd and the other is even. 4. **Relate switch pairs to odd numbers in the next row:** - If (binom{n-1}{j}) and (binom{n-1}{j+1}) form a switch pair (i.e., they have different parities), then their sum contributes to potential odd numbers in row ( n ). - Looking directly below such a switch pair, both elements in the subsequent row ( n ), the sums: [ binom{n}{j} = binom{n-1}{j-1} + binom{n-1}{j} ] [ binom{n}{j+1} = binom{n-1}{j} + binom{n-1}{j+1} ] have a chance of being odd because (binom{n-1}{j-1}) and (binom{n-1}{j}) have different parities and so do (binom{n-1}{j}) and (binom{n-1}{j+1}). 5. **Maximum contribution calculation:** - Each switch pair contributes at most two odd numbers to the next row since both numbers immediately below each switch pair potentially could be odd. - Since each switch pair can lead to at most two odd numbers, the number of odd numbers in row ( n ) is at most twice the number of switch pairs in row ( n-1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can express this as: [ text{Number of odd numbers in row } n leq 2 times text{Number of switch pairs in row } n-1 ] [ boxed{ } ]"},{"prompt":"Among the following propositions, the number of true propositions is(() ()) (①) If (ac > bc), then (a > b); (②) The converse of If (b=3), then (b^{2}=9); (③) The negation of When (x=2), (x^{2}+3x+2=0); (④) The contrapositive of Corresponding angles of similar triangles are equal.

Let's plug in the values we have into the formula and solve for r: 1102.5 = 1000(1 + r/2)^(2*1) Now, we divide both sides by 1000: 1.1025 = (1 + r/2)^2 Next, we take the square root of both sides to get rid of the exponent: sqrt(1.1025) = 1 + r/2 Now, we calculate the square root of 1.1025: 1.0512 ≈ 1 + r/2 Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate r/2: 0.0512 ≈ r/2 Finally, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for r: r ≈ 0.0512 * 2 r ≈ 0.1024 To express the annual interest rate as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r ≈ 0.1024 * 100 r ≈ 10.24% So, the annual interest rate is approximately boxed{10.24%} ."},{"prompt":"Yeongsoo gave Hyogeun 200 won, Hyogeun gave Woong 500 won, and Woong gave Yeongsoo 1000 won.

Here’s a detailed step-by-step approach: 1. **Understanding the Connectivity Requirements:** - The cube at the center of the original pyramid touches six other cubes. - The cubes at the vertices of the pyramid only touch two other cubes. - The cubes along the sides of the triangular base touch four other cubes. 2. **Repositioning the Central Cube:** - Given that the central cube in the initial arrangement touches six other cubes, it must move to a position where only two new cubes are adjacent to it. This can only be achieved if it moves to one of the original vertex positions. - Thus, in the new arrangement, the central cube must move to a vertex position. 3. **Repositioning the Vertex Cubes:** - Since we moved the central cube to a vertex, a vertex cube must now occupy the central position. Let’s assume cube 1 now occupies the central position. - Let’s assume cube 5 moves to the top vertex position. 4. **Repositioning the Side Cubes:** - Cubes initially along the sides (which touch four cubes) now need to move to positions where they only touch new cubes. - Given potential moves, cubes 2 and 3 now occupy two bottom vertex positions because they must be repositioned to ensure they touch only previously untouched cubes. 5. **Determining Remaining Cube Positions:** - Remaining cubes need to be placed sequentially ensuring they meet the conditions specified. This involves trial and error and matching configurations shown in the illustrations. 6. **Verification and Completeness:** - The arrangement needs to be verified to ensure all cubes touch only new cubes and none of the original cubes from the initial configuration. 7. **Explore Symmetry and Rotation:** - Notice that the pyramid can be rotated 120^{circ} around its central vertical axis, generating additional valid configurations. - Additionally, any reflection symmetry along the median of the top vertex doubles the possible solutions. - Finally, swapping roles of central and vertex cubes initially assumed triples the outcomes. # Conclusion The detailed steps conclude that correct and valid arrangements are executed by following the described logical repositioning, symmetry exploitation, and confirming the connectivity specificity.

What is the minimum value of n such that, regardless of how the roads are built, it is possible to travel between any 2 cities (possibly passing through intermediate cities)?","completion":"1. **Define Connectivity**: We say a set of cities is connected if it's possible to travel between any two cities in the set by using roads (possibly through intermediate cities). Naturally, different connected groups cannot share cities. 2. **Check the Minimum Number of Roads**: If the government builds all possible roads within a group of 20 cities and leaves one city isolated, the total number of roads is: [ binom{20}{2} = frac{20 times 19}{2} = 190 ] Thus, with 190 roads, it is possible to isolate one city, and the requirement of full connectivity (being able to travel between any two cities) is not necessarily met. Therefore, ( n ) must be greater than 190. 3. **Assume 191 Roads are Sufficient**: We now demonstrate that with 191 roads, all cities must be part of a single connected component. Assume otherwise—that there are more than one connected components. Let ( A ) be such a component containing ( k ) cities where ( 1 le k le 20 ). 4. **Calculate the Maximum Possible Roads in Two Components**: Recall the formula for the maximum number of roads within a group of ( n ) cities: [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] Thus, for the group ( A ) with ( k ) cities and the rest ( 21 - k ) cities, the total number of roads can be calculated as: [ frac{k(k-1)}{2} + frac{(21 - k)(20 - k)}{2} ] 5. **Simplify the Expression**: Expanding and simplifying the above expression: [ frac{k(k-1)}{2} + frac{(21-k)(20-k)}{2} ] [ = frac{k^2 - k + (21-k)(20-k)}{2} ] [ = frac{k^2 - k + 420 - 41k + k^2}{2} ] [ = frac{2k^2 - 42k + 420}{2} ] [ = k^2 - 21k + 210 ] 6. **Bound the Number of Roads**: Considering the function: [ k^2 - 21k + 210 ] We can rewrite it as: [ k^2 - 21k + 210 = left(k - frac{21}{2}right)^2 + frac{399}{4} ] Simplifying further, since completing the square yields: [ left(k - frac{21}{2}right)^2 + frac{399}{4} ] Since the maximum value of (left(k - frac{21}{2}right)^2) can reach is if is centered at ( k = 0 ), hence: [ left(frac{19}{2}right)^2 + frac{399}{4} = left(frac{21^2 - 4(21^2/4)}{4}right) + 399/4 = frac{190}{4} + 399/4 = 190. ] The maximum number of edges can be (190) but since (k in (1 leq k leq 20), not 0 = 189. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, having 191 roads ensures that there cannot be more than one connected component, making it necessary for all cities to be connected.

This implies: [ n^p + 1 = k(p^n + 1) ] We will consider two cases based on the parity of (n). # Case 1: (n) is even Let (n = 2m) where (m) is a positive integer. Substituting (n = 2m) into the equation, we get: [ (2m)^p + 1 = k(p^{2m} + 1) ] This can be rewritten as: [ (2m)^p equiv -1 pmod{p^{2m} + 1} ] Since ((2m)^p equiv -1 pmod{p^{2m} + 1}), it implies that (gcd(2m, p^{2m} + 1) = 1). This is only possible if (p = 2). Substituting (p = 2) into the equation, we get: [ n^2 + 1 = k(2^n + 1) ] We need to find (n) such that this equation holds. Let's check small values of (n): - For (n = 2): [ 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 quad text{and} quad 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 quad text{so} quad k = 1 ] - For (n = 4): [ 4^2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 quad text{and} quad 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 quad text{so} quad k = 1 ] For (n > 4), the right-hand side grows faster than the left-hand side because (2^n) grows exponentially while (n^2) grows quadratically. Therefore, there are no solutions for (n > 4). Thus, the solutions for this case are ((2, 2)) and ((2, 4)). # Case 2: (n) is odd In this case, (p + 1) must be a factor of (p^n + 1). Taking the equation modulo (p + 1), we get: [ n^p + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p + 1} implies n^p equiv -1 pmod{p + 1} ] This implies: [ n^{2p} equiv 1 pmod{p + 1} ] Thus, the order of (n) modulo (p + 1) must divide (2p). Since the order cannot be a divisor of (p), it must be either (2) or (2p). However, (2p > phi(p + 1)), so the order must be (2). Therefore: [ n equiv -1 pmod{p + 1} implies n = m(p + 1) - 1 ] Substituting (n = m(p + 1) - 1) into the original equation, we get: [ [(m(p + 1) - 1)]^p + 1 = k(p^{m(p + 1) - 1} + 1) ] When (m = 1), we have (n = p), which satisfies the equation when (k = 1). For (m > 1), the right-hand side grows faster than the left-hand side, so there are no solutions for (m > 1).

The marking rules are: - A number cannot be marked if it has already been marked. - A number cannot be marked if it is twice a marked number. - A number cannot be marked if it is half of a marked number and is still an integer. Player A starts by marking the number 8. Player B needs to ensure they win by the choice they make next. 2. **Classify the Numbers:** Next, we classify all numbers from 1 to 17 based on the marking rules, dividing them into groups that are related by being multiples or halves of each other: - **Five-Element Group:** (16, 8, 4, 2, 1) - **Three-Element Group:** (12, 6, 3) - **Two-Element Groups:** (14, 7), (10, 5) - **Single Elements:** (17), (15), (13), (11), (9) 3. **After A's Move (Marking 8):** After player A marks 8, according to the rules: - 16 and 4 cannot be marked because they are either doubles or halves of 8. Thus, the remaining groups adjust to: - **Three-Element Group:** (12, 6, 3) - **Two-Element Groups:** (14, 7), (10, 5) - **One-Element Group:** (2, 1) - **Single Elements:** (17), (15), (13), (11), (9) 4. **Optimal Move for B:** Player B must choose a number that maximizes their chances of winning by constraining possible subsequent choices for A. The most impactful choices would come from groups where more numbers could potentially be restricted. By choosing 6 from the three-element group ( (12, 6, 3) ): - 12, being double of 6, cannot be marked. - 3, being half of 6, also cannot be marked. Now, A's available options are reduced significantly: 5. **Resulting Groups After B Marks 6:** - **Two-Element Groups:** (14, 7), (10, 5), (2, 1) - **Single Elements:** (17), (15), (13), (11), (9) In this state, regardless of how A proceeds (by choosing from these remaining options), B will always have a follow-up move that keeps the game in B's favor. 6. **Conclusion:** Hence, to ensure that player B wins, B should mark the number 6.

Since a and b are different variables, 3a and 2b are not like terms and cannot be combined in a way that would result in 5ab. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B: 2a^{3}+3a^{2}=5a^{5}** Here, we have two terms, 2a^{3} and 3a^{2}, being added together. The correct operation for combining like terms involves adding or subtracting the coefficients of terms with the same variable and exponent. Since the exponents are different (3 and 2), these are not like terms, and even if they were, the operation would not change the exponents in the way shown. Thus, option B is incorrect. **Option C: 5a^{2}-4a^{2}=1** In this option, we're subtracting 4a^{2} from 5a^{2}. Both terms have the same variable and exponent, making them like terms.

Both terms have the same variables with the same exponents, but the order of the variables is different.

Let's denote the length of PQ as \\"a\\". Given that the least possible length of XZ is 3.2 cm, we can infer that this occurs when X is at P and Y is at R, making XZ parallel and equal in length to QR. This is because any other position of X on PQ would result in a longer XZ due to the properties of parallel lines and the fact that triangle XYZ would be similar to triangle PQR, with XYZ being smaller than PQR. Therefore, when XZ is at its minimum length, it is equal to QR, which is given as 8 cm. However, the problem states that the least possible length of XZ is 3.2 cm, not 8 cm. This suggests that there is a scaling factor involved. Let's denote the scaling factor as \\"k\\". The scaled-down version of QR (which is XZ at its minimum length) would be: k * QR = XZ_min k * 8 cm = 3.2 cm k = 3.2 cm / 8 cm k = 0.4 Now, since the triangles PQR and XYZ are similar when XZ is at its minimum length, the same scaling factor would apply to the length of PQ. a * k = PQ_scaled a * 0.4 = PQ We need to find the actual length of PQ (denoted as \\"a\\"), so we rearrange the equation: a = PQ / 0.4 a = PQ / (2/5) a = (5/2) * PQ Since PQ_scaled is the minimum length of XZ, which is 3.2 cm, we can substitute this value into the equation: a = (5/2) * 3.2 cm a = 5 * 1.6 cm a = 8 cm Therefore, the length of PQ is boxed{8} cm."},{"prompt":"f (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = 4) and (frac{1}{x} frac{1}{y} = 8), what is the value of (x + y)?

Finding the roots of k, we calculate: x_{1,2} = frac{500 pm sqrt{500^2 - 4 cdot 625}}{2} = frac{500 pm 450}{2} = 475, 25. Thus, we can factorize k(x) = (x - 475)(x - 25). Applying this to h(x), we get: h(x) = (x^2 - 475)(x^2 - 25). We factorize further: h(x) = (x^2 - 475)(x^2 - 25) = ((x-5)(x+5))((x-sqrt{475})(x+sqrt{475})). Here sqrt{475} = 5sqrt{19}, and this value is not an integer, hence we consider only the perfect square factors. For h(x) to be prime, we require at least one of these factors to be pm1.

Since Ann is the fastest (even with her sprained wrist), followed by Bob, and then Carol, we should prioritize Ann's time, then Bob's, and finally Carol's. Let's calculate the individual frosting rates per minute for each person: - Ann: 1 cake / 8 minutes = 0.125 cakes/minute - Bob: 1 cake / 6 minutes = 0.1667 cakes/minute - Carol: 1 cake / 10 minutes = 0.1 cakes/minute Now, let's consider the passing time. Since it takes 1 minute to pass a cake from one person to another, we should minimize the number of passes. A good strategy would be to have Ann start frosting a cake, and as soon as she's done, she passes it to Bob, who then passes it to Carol. While Bob and Carol are frosting, Ann can start on the next cake. Let's calculate the time it takes for one cake to go through all three people: - Ann: 8 minutes - Passing from Ann to Bob: 1 minute - Bob: 6 minutes - Passing from Bob to Carol: 1 minute - Carol: 10 minutes Total time for one cake: 8 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 10 = 26 minutes However, they will work simultaneously, so while Carol is working on the first cake, Bob can start on the second cake, and Ann can start on the third cake. This means that after the initial 26 minutes, each subsequent cake will only take as long as the slowest person in the chain, which is Carol at 10 minutes per cake. For the first cake, it takes 26 minutes. For the remaining 9 cakes, it will take 9 * 10 = 90 minutes.

The orthocenter ( M ) divides the altitudes in the ratios ( 2:1 ) and ( 3:2 ) from the vertices. Additionally, the distance from the orthocenter to the third vertex is given as ( d ). We need to construct such a triangle. Here is the step-by-step process for achieving that: 1. **Initial Setup and Ratios:** Let ( A, B, ) and ( C ) be the vertices of the triangle. The orthocenter ( M ) divides the altitude from ( A ) (i.e., ( AD )) into the ratio ( 2:1 ) and divides the altitude from ( B ) (i.e., ( BE )) into the ratio ( 3:2 ). This means: [ AM : MD = 2 : 1, quad BM : ME = 3 : 2 ] 2. **Constructing a similar triangle:** Start by constructing a smaller, similar triangle meeting the same criteria. Define some arbitrary segment ( A'D' ) where we will place points ( A' ), ( D' ) and a point ( M' ) such that ( A'M' : M'D' = 2 : 1 ). 3. **Finding the harmonic point:** Identify the harmonic point ( G' ) such that: [ G'M' = frac{2}{3} A'M' ] 4. **Perpendicular construction:** Erect perpendiculars from ( G' ) and ( D' ) to ( A'D' ), denoted by lines ( g' ) and ( a' ), respectively. 5. **Intersecting Thales’ circle:** Construct a Thales’ semicircle above ( A'M' ), intersecting ( g' ) at point ( E' ). 6. **Creating similar segments:** By intersecting perpendicular line ( a' ) from ( E'M' ), locate points ( B' ) and similarly, from ( A'E' ), locate ( C' ). 7. **Establish Perpendiculars:** Ensure ( A'C' perp B'E' ). This guarantees that ( A'B'C' ) retains the correct triangle properties with correct altitude ratios. 8. **Final scaling with given ( d ):** Measure the distance ( M'C' ). Adjust the size of the constructed ( triangle A'B'C' ) by scaling it according to the given distance ( d ). 9. **Parallel Construction:** Draw parallels passing through the newly obtained point ( C ) to ( C'A') and ( C'B'). The intersections on these parallels with the lines ( M'A' ) and ( M'B' ) will give you points ( A ) and ( B ). 10. **Verifying all requirements:** Ensure that triangle ( ABC ) meets all criteria: the orthocenter calculations, correct altitude splits, and the given distance ( d ). # Conclusion Following these steps meticulously ensures that the triangle ( triangle ABC ) is constructed accurately according to the given conditions.

This means (C') is directly opposite (C) across the diameter of the cylinder. 3. **Angles in tetrahedrons:** Consider the tetrahedron (OABC) based on the axis (OA), (OB), and (OC). Let the dihedral angles related to the prism edges (OA), (OB), and (OC) be denoted by (alpha), (beta), and (gamma), respectively. Now consider the tetrahedron (OABC') based on the axis (OA), (OB), and (OC'): - The dihedral angles between (OBC') and the prism's faces (OAB), (OAC'), and (OBC') will be symmetrical to the angles in tetrahedron (OABC) but measured with respect to the adjacent faces.

Every line contains points from at most two of these sets. 2. Every circle with a rational center contains points from all three sets. Let's define the rational points more precisely and divide them into three sets: 1. **Definition of Rational Points:** A rational point in the plane can be expressed in the form ((frac{a}{b}, frac{c}{d})), where (a, b, c, d) are integers and (b) and (d) are non-zero. Furthermore, (a) and (b) are coprime (i.e., gcd(a,b) = 1), and (c) and (d) are coprime (i.e., gcd(c,d) = 1). 2. **Definition of the Sets:** We will divide these points into sets (A), (B), and (C) based on the parity (odd or even) of (b) and (d): - Let (A) be the set of points ((frac{a}{b}, frac{c}{d})) where both (b) and (d) are **odd**. - Let (B) be the set of points ((frac{a}{b}, frac{c}{d})) where one of (a) and (d) is **odd** and one of (b) and (d) is **even**, or both (a) and (d) are **even** while (b) and (d) are **odd** (covering mixed parities). - Let (C) be the remaining points, i.e., the points ((frac{a}{b}, frac{c}{d})) where both (b) and (d) are **even**. 3. **Ensuring every line contains points from at most two sets:** - Consider any line equation of the form (y = mx + c), where (m) is the slope and (c) is the y-intercept. - We need to show that such a line cannot intersect all three sets (A), (B), and (C) simultaneously. - Since both (b) and (d) being odd (for points in (A)) and both being even (for points in (C)) are mutually exclusive, it is impossible for a line to have points with both odd denominators and both even denominators simultaneously. Therefore, any line can contain points from at most two of these sets. 4. **Ensuring every circle with a rational center contains points from all three sets:** - Consider a circle centered at ((frac{p}{q}, frac{r}{s})) with a rational center, which includes the equation ((x - frac{p}{q})^2 + (y - frac{r}{s})^2 = R^2) for some rational radius (R). - Due to the symmetry and the continuity of the circle, as long as the circle is not degenerate and the center coordinates are rational, there will be points in all parities near any given rational point in the plane. - This property ensures that the circle can contain points from all three sets (A), (B), and (C), taking into account the different combinations of even and odd denominators and numerators. # Conclusion: By construction, rational points divided as per the sets (A), (B), and (C) satisfy the given conditions that every line contains points from at most two sets and every circle with a rational center contains points from all three sets.

These cycles are important as they help in determining mappings that preserve graph structure. 2. **Properties of the Graph and Cycles**: - A vertex’s degree is the number of edges incident to it. - A circle in a graph is a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertex, with each consecutive pair of vertices connected by an edge. - A minimal circle in the graph refers to a cycle that doesn’t revisit any vertex except at the endpoints. 3. **Homomorphisms and Cycle Mapping**: - A graph homomorphism maps vertices to vertices and edges to edges, preserving adjacency. - Odd-length circles are mapped to odd-length circles under homomorphisms. This follows from the fact that odd-length cycles must contain an odd number of vertices to sum up degrees and edge lengths correctly. 4. **Examining Cycles in the Graph**: - The minimal odd-length cycles in the graph are given and their lengths calculated: - A-B-C-A, A-B-D-A, and A-C-D-A: Each has a length of 7. - B-C-D-B: Length is 9. - These cycles being odd ensure that any mapping retains their cycle structure, i.e., maps to another cycle of the same length. 5. **Properties of Vertex Degrees and Uniqueness**: - Homomorphism properties ensure that cycles of the graph map onto cycles of the same lengths. - For the vertices A, B, C, and D to map correctly under a homomorphism (i.e., mapping a vertex to itself or another vertex of the same degree), we need to confirm that each of these vertices maps uniquely. 6. **Ensuring the Mapping is Identity**: - It can be shown that A must map to A. If A mapped to any other vertex, the cycle mapping would disrupt the cycle structure, ensuring incorrect edge mappings. - Similarly, for B, C, and D, detailed logical steps confirm that each must map to itself. This involves ensuring their neighbors in considered cycles also preserve their respective mappings. 7. **Graph Homomorphism Uniqueness**: - Using properties like homomorphism preservation of adjacency and degrees, it is concluded that if one vertex (like A) maps to itself, subsequently, B, C, and D map correctly maintaining the graph's degree structure. 8. **Conclusion**: - The only valid graph homomorphism that maps the graph to itself while preserving all degrees and adjacency structures is the identity mapping. - Hence, there is only one way to map the graph into itself, which is the identity map where every vertex maps to itself.

Since the area of the square is 2500 square units, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area: Side length of square = √2500 = 50 units The radius of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, so: Radius of circle = 50 units The length of the rectangle is two-fifths of the radius of the circle, so: Length of rectangle = (2/5) * Radius of circle Length of rectangle = (2/5) * 50 Length of rectangle = 20 units We are given the breadth (width) of the rectangle as 10 units.

Given that the curve y=f(x) is tangent to the x-axis at the point (1,f(1)), this implies that f'(1) = 0. Substituting x=1 into the derivative gives: f'(1) = frac{1-a}{1^2} = 0 implies 1-a = 0 implies a = 1. After verification, we find that a=1 satisfies the conditions.

The lines AF_2 and BF_2 intersect the yaxis at points P and Q, respectively. If the perimeter of triangle PQF_2 is 12, find the eccentricity of the hyperbola when ab is at its maximum value.","completion":"First, we will define the properties of the hyperbola and the geometric setup given in the problem. For a hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, the distance between the foci is 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2 and the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a}. Since the line through F_1 is perpendicular to the x-axis and intersects the left branch, points A and B are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. This implies that the lengths of the line segments PF_2 and QF_2 are equal. Let's denote the length of PF_2 (which is equal to QF_2) as l. The perimeter of triangle PQF_2 consists of the lengths of PF_2, QF_2, and PQ. Since PF_2 and QF_2 are equal in length, and considering the y-axis symmetry, PQ is twice the y-coordinate of point A or B. Let's denote the y-coordinate of A (or B) as y_A. Therefore, the perimeter is 2l + 2y_A = 12. Now, we need to express these lengths in terms of a and b. Using the definition of a hyperbola, the focal length is 2c (the distance from F_1 to F_2). Since the hyperbola is centered at the origin, and F_1 and F_2 lie on the x-axis, F_2 has coordinates (c, 0). To find the coordinates of A or B, we can use the fact that the line through A or B and F_1 is vertical. Since it passes through F_1, which has coordinates (-c, 0), the equation of the line is x = -c. Substituting x = -c into the equation of the hyperbola yields y_A = bsqrt{1 + (c/a)^2} due to the symmetry of the hyperbola along the x-axis. Thus, PQ = 2y_A = 2bsqrt{1 + (c/a)^2}. Using the relationships we've established, we can write: 2l + 2bsqrt{1 + (c/a)^2} = 12 Since l is the length of PF_2, we can calculate it using the distance formula from F_2 to P, where the coordinates of P are (0, y_A). Thus, l = sqrt{c^2 + y_A^2}. Substituting the values of l and y_A in terms of a, b, and c into the perimeter equation, we get: 2sqrt{c^2 + b^2(1 + (c/a)^2)} + 2bsqrt{1 + (c/a)^2} = 12 Since c^2 = a^2 + b^2, let's simplify the equation above: 2sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2} + 2bsqrt{1 + (a^2 + b^2)/a^2} = 12 Now taking 2sqrt{2} common from the terms under the first square root and 2 under the second square root, we get 2sqrt{2}sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + 2bsqrt{2} = 12 Now, we can simplify this equation further to express everything in terms of a and b, keeping in mind that the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a}. sqrt{2}sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + bsqrt{2} = 6 Divide both sides by sqrt{2} to get: sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + b = frac{6}{sqrt{2}} We want to maximize ab. The function to be maximized is ab subject to the constraint sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + b = frac{6}{sqrt{2}}. We can use calculus to find the maximum value of ab. However, recalling the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we know that for non-negative a and b, frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}. Given that b + sqrt{a^2 + b^2} is constant, we can maximize sqrt{ab} by letting a = b. Substituting a = b into the constraint equation gives us asqrt{2} + a = frac{6}{sqrt{2}}, which simplifies to a(1 + sqrt{2}) = frac{6}{sqrt{2}}, hence a = frac{3}{1 + sqrt{2}} cdot frac{1 - sqrt{2}}{1 - sqrt{2}} = 3(1 - sqrt{2}). This gives us b = a = 3(1 - sqrt{2}). We now have a and b, and we can now calculate the eccentricity e when ab is at its maximum value: e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} Substituting the values for a and b we found: e = frac{sqrt{[3(1 - sqrt{2})]^2 + [3(1 - sqrt{2})]^2}}{3(1 - sqrt{2})} = frac{sqrt{2} cdot 3(1 - sqrt{2})}{3(1 - sqrt{2})} = sqrt{2} Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola when ab is at its maximum value is boxed{sqrt{2}}."},{"prompt":"What is the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2053 odd positive integers?","completion":"The units digit of an odd, positive integer can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

Part (a): Double-sided bounded cylinder 1. **Symmetry Axis**: The cylinder has an axis of symmetry which is the central axis around which the cylinder is rotationally symmetric. 2. **Single plane of symmetry**: There is one plane of symmetry which is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and intersects it at the midpoint of the cylinder. 3. **Bundle of planes of symmetry**: There is a bundle of planes of symmetry passing through the axis of the cylinder. Each of these planes divides the cylinder into two mirror-image halves. 4. **Center of symmetry**: The center of symmetry is the midpoint of the axis of the cylinder. Any point on the axis can be considered symmetric with respect to this central point. Part (b): Single-sided bounded cylinder 1. **Symmetry Axis**: The cylinder has an axis of symmetry which is the central axis around which the cylinder is rotationally symmetric. 2. **Bundle of planes of symmetry**: A bundle of planes of symmetry exists around the axis of the cylinder. These planes pass through the axis and divide the cylinder into symmetrical halves. 3. **No central symmetry point**: Unlike the double-sided bounded cylinder, the single-sided bounded cylinder does not possess a center of symmetry. Part (c): Double-sided unbounded cylinder 1. **Symmetry Axis**: The cylinder has an axis of symmetry which is the central axis around which the cylinder is rotationally symmetric. 2. **Two systems of planes of symmetry**: - One system of planes perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder exists but is only conceptual since the cylinder is unbounded. These planes would intersect the axis perpendicularly. - Another system consists of planes passing through the axis of the cylinder. These planes can be any plane that contains the axis, dividing the cylinder into symmetrical sections. 3. **Centers of symmetry**: Every point on the axis of the cylinder can be considered a center of symmetry. This implies infinite centers of symmetry along the axis. Conclusion: - For the double-sided bounded cylinder, we have a central axis of symmetry, a perpendicular plane of symmetry at the midpoint, and a bundle of planes through the axis, with the midpoint being the center of symmetry. - For the single-sided bounded cylinder, we have a central axis of symmetry and a bundle of planes through the axis, but no center of symmetry. - For the double-sided unbounded cylinder, we have a central axis of symmetry and two systems of planes of symmetry, with every point on the axis being a center of symmetry. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The cubic polynomial 8x^3 + 8x^2 + 80x + 800 can be expressed in the form a(x+b)^3 + c, where a, b, and c are constants.

This implies that the vertices in ( A setminus U ) can be matched to vertices in ( N(A setminus U) ). 5. **Use Hall's Necessary Condition:** - From the conditions mentioned above, according to Hall's condition, if ( A setminus U ) can be matched to ( N(A setminus U) ), then combining this matching with the edges of ( M ) that relate to ( A cap U ) will lead to a matching that saturates ( A ). 6. **Returning to Finite Graph:** - Considering this scenario in finite graphs, Lemma 8.4.9 essentially applies Hall's Marriage Theorem. - If we find ( N(S) ) can be matched to ( S ), but the reverse does not hold (i.e., ( S ) cannot be matched to ( N(S) )), this is a contradiction. Hence, it must be the case that ( |S| > |N(S)| ). 7. **Correct Implication:** - If ( |S| > |N(S)| ), then there exists no matching that saturates ( A ), confirming the necessary condition for the matching. 8. **Summary and Conclusion:** - Therefore, by contraposition of Hall’s Theorem, it is proved that unless there exists a subset ( S subseteq A ) such that ( |S| > |N(S)| ), there will be a matching that saturates ( A ). This completes the proof using Hall's Marriage Theorem and its contrapositive.

We aim to prove that at least three of the scientists must be discussing the same topic among themselves. 2. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**: Select any one scientist, say A. Scientist A communicates with the remaining 16 scientists. Given that there are only 3 topics to discuss, by the Pigeonhole Principle (which states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must hold more than one item), we know that A must be discussing the same topic with at least: [ leftlceil frac{16}{3} rightrceil = 6 ] other scientists.

Consider any one of these 6 scientists, say B_1. Scientist B_1 communicates with the other 5 scientists about Topic II or Topic III. - **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle Again**: Since B_1 discusses with 5 other scientists and there are only two remaining topics (II and III), by the Pigeonhole Principle, B_1 discusses the same topic with at least: [ leftlceil frac{5}{2} rightrceil = 3 ] other scientists. Let's assume B_1 discusses Topic II with at least 3 of them, say B_2, B_3, B_4. 5. **Final Verification**: - If any of B_2, B_3, B_4 discuss Topic II with each other, it completes the situation where at least three scientists (B_1 and these two) are discussing the same topic among themselves. - If B_2, B_3, B_4 do not discuss Topic II among themselves, we check Topic III. By similar logic, we should find a cluster of three scientists discussing Topic III. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, by pursuit of each logical branch and application of the Pigeonhole Principle, we have demonstrated that there must necessarily be at least three scientists who discuss the same topic among themselves, validating the premise of our proof.

First, we understand the problem setup and then use some geometric properties and inequalities to prove the result. 1. **Problem Setup**: - We have a triangle ABC with angles alpha, beta, and gamma such that alpha leq beta leq gamma < 90^{circ}. - The foot of the perpendiculars from A,B, and C to the opposite sides are T_A, T_B, and T_C respectively. 2. **Thales' Circle Application**: - Consider the Thales circle on the side AB. Points T_A and T_B are on this Thales circle. - Since the triangle ABC is acute-angled, both T_A and T_B lie on the same side of AB. Therefore, by properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the cyclic angles condition gives us: [ angle ABT_B = angle AT_A T_B = 90^{circ} - alpha ] 3. **Computing Other Angles**: - Similarly, for side BC, we have: [ angle BCT_C = angle BT_B T_C = 90^{circ} - beta ] - For side CA, we have: [ angle CAT_A = angle CT_C T_A = 90^{circ} - gamma ] 4. **Angles in the Pedal Triangle**: - Using the above relations, the angles in the pedal triangle T_A T_B T_C can be expressed in terms of alpha, beta, and gamma: [ angle T_C T_A T_B = 180^{circ} - 2 alpha ] [ angle T_A T_B T_C = 180^{circ} - 2 beta ] [ angle T_B T_C T_A = 180^{circ} - 2 gamma ] 5. **Comparing Angles**: - Since alpha leq beta leq gamma < 90^{circ}, it follows that 180^{circ} - 2 alpha geq 180^{circ} - 2 beta geq 180^{circ} - 2 gamma. - Therefore: [ 2 alpha + gamma leq alpha + beta + gamma = 180^{circ} ] [ gamma leq 180^{circ} - 2 alpha ] 6. **Conclusion**: - Indeed, the maximum angle (180^{circ} - 2alpha) in the pedal triangle is at least as large as the maximum angle (gamma) in the original triangle ABC. - Equality holds if and only if alpha = beta leq gamma < 90^{circ}. This results in: [ 45^{circ} < alpha = beta leq 60^{circ}, quad 60^{circ} leq gamma < 90^{circ} ] - Hence, the equality condition is satisfied for isosceles triangles where the enclosed angle of the equal legs is an acute angle no smaller than 60^{circ}. Therefore, we have shown that the greatest angle in the pedal triangle is always at least as large as the greatest angle in the original triangle, with detailed steps verifying all necessary conditions.

What is its geometric meaning? What does the expression PP, (partes proportionales) mean? Why does interpolation generally provide approximate results, and why is this approximation practically sufficient? (Examples of various tables.)","completion":"Let's explain in more detail how interpolation is performed when using tables, the geometric meaning of interpolation, and the concept of \\"PP\\" (partes proportionales). 1. **Definition and Principle of Interpolation:** Interpolation is a method used to estimate the value of a function f(x) (in logarithm tables, the function log x) for an argument x, which is not directly found in the table. Suppose n and n+1 are two consecutive numbers (arguments) present in the table, and n < x < n+1. Interpolation is based on the assumption that within the interval between n and n+1, the increments in the function f(x) change proportionally to the increments in the argument x. 2. **Interpolation Formula:** The relationship exploited for interpolation can be expressed as follows: [ frac{f(x) - f(n)}{f(n+1) - f(n)} = frac{x - n}{(n+1) - n} ] Simplifying the denominator in the argument interval, we obtain: [ frac{f(x) - f(n)}{f(n+1) - f(n)} = x - n ] 3. **Solving for f(x):** Multiplying both sides by f(n+1) - f(n) to isolate f(x): [ f(x) - f(n) = (x - n) [f(n+1) - f(n)] ] Therefore, the value of the function at x can be given as: [ f(x) = f(n) + (x - n) [f(n+1) - f(n)] ] Here, f(n+1) - f(n) is known as the **tabular difference**. 4. **Applicability and Accuracy:** Interpolation provides sufficiently accurate results under the condition that the tabular differences change very slowly in the specific section of the table. This implies that the table values should be densely populated or the function should be fairly linear within that interval. 5. **Geometric Interpretation:** Geometrically, interpolation assumes that the arc of the curve y = f(x) between the ordinates f(n) and f(n+1) can be approximated by a straight line segment (chord). This means that we assume the function between these points is linear, which simplifies calculations. 6. **Meaning of \\"PP\\" (Partes Proportionales):** \\"PP\\" stands for **partes proportionales**, which emphasizes the concept of proportional parts. It indicates that the interpolation process involves dividing the interval into proportional segments to estimate the intermediate value. # Conclusion: The process of interpolation can be succinctly summarized by the formula: [ f(x) = f(n) + (x - n) [f(n+1) - f(n)] ] This formula is based on the assumption of a linear change within the interval. The geometric meaning is that we approximate the curve segment with a straight line, and the partes proportionales concept ensures that the division of intervals is done proportionally, providing a practical approximation. Interpolation provides approximate values sufficient for practical applications where direct table values are not available. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The room temperature ( T ) (in degrees Celsius) as a function of time ( t ) (in hours) is given by: [ T = a sin t + b cos t, quad t in (0, +infty) ] where ( a ) and ( b ) are positive real numbers.

Initially, place a maximal clique ( C ) in ( R_1 ) and all other competitors in ( R_2 ). Let the size of the maximal clique ( C ) be ( 2k ) (since it is given that the largest size of a clique is even). 2. **Moving Competitors**: Start moving competitors from ( R_1 ) to ( R_2 ) one by one until either: - The maximal sizes of cliques in both rooms equalize, or - The maximal size of a clique in ( R_2 ) becomes one more than the maximal size of a clique in ( R_1 ). 3. **Assumption**: Assume the latter case occurs.

Moving ( x_1 ) to ( R_1 ) destroys the maximal clique ( A cup K_1 ). - If it destroys all other maximal cliques ( A cup K_i ), then stop: the maximal sizes of cliques in both rooms equalize to ( p ). - Otherwise, choose ( x_2 in K_2 ) who is not a friend of ( x_1 ). Move ( x_2 ) to ( R_1 ). Repeat this process. 8. **Final Moves**: At each move, the size of a maximal clique in ( R_1 ) either stays ( p ) or increases to ( p+1 ). If it increases to ( p+1 ) before the last move, the maximal sizes of cliques in both rooms equalize to ( p+1 ). If the maximal size of a clique in ( R_1 ) stays ( p ) after the last move, the two maximal sizes equalize to ( p ). 9. **Last Move Analysis**: Before the last move, there is no ( (p+1) )-clique in ( R_1 ), but after the move, there is such a clique. Let ( x_ell ) be the last person moved. ( x_ell ) is a member of a ( (p+1) )-clique ( X ) in ( R_1 ). Since ( x_{ell-1} ) is not a friend of ( x_ell ), it cannot participate in this ( (p+1) )-clique ( X ). 10. **Restoring the Clique**: Moving ( x_{ell-1} ) back to ( R_2 ) restores the ( (p+1) )-clique ( A cup K_{ell-1} ) in ( R_2 ), equalizing the sizes of maximal cliques in both rooms to ( p+1 ).

Let's follow these steps: 1. **Problem Reframing**: Let's transform this problem by considering the pancake as a circle and the coin as another smaller circle within it. Each straight cut corresponds to a strip of width 2 (considering the total width resulting from the intersection with the smaller circle on either side). 2. **Geometrical Consideration**: For each straight line cut, it creates a strip of width 2 units that intersects the circle at possible points where the coin's center could lie. Thus, the task can be rephrased as covering the larger circle (with radius 10) using strips of width 2 units. 3. **Calculation of Strips Needed**: Each strip of width 2 captures a width of exactly 2 units on the circle's plane. To cover the entire diameter of 20 units (as the diameter of the larger circle is (2 times text{radius} = 20)), we need: [ text{Number of strips} geq frac{text{Diameter of larger circle}}{text{Width of one strip}} = frac{20}{2} = 10 ] So, we need at least 10 such strips to cover the entire area of the larger circle. 4. **Verification**: We need to also show that fewer than 10 strips would not suffice. Suppose we only use 9 strips. The total width covered would be: [ 9 times 2 = 18 ] This leaves out 2 units uncovered, meaning a coin could still potentially sit within this gap of 2 units without being intersected by any strip. Hence, 9 strips will be insufficient to guarantee an intersection. 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, the least number of straight line cuts required to ensure that the coin is always intersected, regardless of its position within the pancake, is: [ boxed{10} ]"},{"prompt":"Observe that (x^2)' = 2x, (x^4)' = 4x^3, and (cos x)' = sin x.

We then subtract this probability from 1. Step 1: Calculate the probability that the product is not divisible by 2. For the product to not be divisible by 2, all eight numbers rolled must be odd. The probability of rolling an odd number (1, 3, 5) on one die is frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}. Since the dice rolls are independent, the probability that all eight dice show odd numbers is: [ left(frac{1}{2}right)^8 = frac{1}{256}. ] Step 2: Calculate the probability that the product is divisible by 4 but not by 8. For this scenario, exactly two dice must show a number that contributes exactly one factor of 2 (i.e., rolling a 2), and other six must show odd numbers. The probability for each individual scenario where two dice roll a 2 and others roll odd ones is: [ left(frac{1}{6}right)^2 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^6 = frac{1}{36} times frac{1}{64} = frac{1}{2304}. ] However, we need to count all ways to select these two dice from eight, which is binom{8}{2} = 28 ways.

The total probability that the product is not divisible by 8 is the sum of the probabilities from Step 1 and Step 2: [ frac{1}{256} + frac{7}{576} = frac{9}{576} + frac{7}{576} = frac{16}{576} = frac{2}{72} = frac{1}{36}. ] Step 4: Calculate the probability that the product is divisible by 8. The probability that the product is divisible by 8 is the complement of the probability that it is not divisible by 8: [ 1 - frac{1}{36} = frac{36}{36} - frac{1}{36} = frac{35}{36}. ] Thus, the final probability is frac{35{36}}.

We must show that it is possible to partition all such sequences into 20 groups such that no two sequences that are \\"compatible\\" (i.e., coinciding in exactly 4 positions) end up in the same group. Step 2: Combinatorial Analysis of Compatibility Consider the notion of compatibility: two sequences of length 2022 are compatible if they coincide in exactly 4 positions, meaning they are either both 1s or both 0s in those 4 positions. Step 3: Counting Initial Positions We can restrict our attention to the first 5 positions for initial grouping. The number of ways to place exactly three 1s in 5 positions is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{5}{3} = 10 ] This calculation indicates there are 10 different patterns for placing three 1s in 5 positions. Step 4: Grouping by Initial Patterns For each of the 10 possible patterns, group the sequences based on their first 5 positions. All sequences belonging to the same group have their first 3 ones and 2 zeros in the same specific positions. Thus, this will give us 10 groups. We can further refine this process by considering the sequences initially grouped as follows: 1. Construct a similar set of groups based on placing three 0s in the first 5 positions. The number of ways to place exactly three 0s in 5 positions is similarly given by: [ binom{5}{3} = 10 ] This accounts for another 10 groups, forming another layer of 10 patterns of sequences based on positions of zeros. Step 5: Non-Compatibility within Groups By this arrangement: - Any two sequences within a group defined by their initial 5 positions (either by three 1s or three 0s) cannot be compatible. Compatibility requires at least the same set positions of three 1s and another disjoint set of positions for a 0, which is not possible when limited to a subset of specific sequence patterns defined in our groups. Step 6: Ensuring All Sequences are Grouped Since each sequence must follow exactly one of these described initial patterns, it ensures that all sequences are covered within the 20 resulting groups (10 from 1s concentration and 10 from 0s concentration). Conclusion: Andrey Mikhaylovich succeeds in partitioning the sequences into 20 groups such that no two compatible sequences are in the same group. This achieves the required non-compatibility within each defined group.

(1) The domain of f(x) is (-frac{1}{a}, +infty). Calculating the first derivative we get f'(x) = frac{1}{x + frac{1}{a}} - a = -frac{a^2x}{ax + 1}. Since a > 0, we have f'(x) > 0 on the interval (-frac{1}{a}, 0) and f'(x) < 0 on the interval (0, +infty). Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (-frac{1}{a}, 0) and decreasing on (0, +infty). (2) Since a > 0, h(x) = ax - f(x) means h(x) = 2ax - lnleft(x + frac{1}{a}right). The derivative of h is h'(x) = 2a - frac{1}{x + frac{1}{a}} = frac{2ax + 1}{x + frac{1}{a}}. Hence, h'(x) < 0 in the interval left(-frac{1}{a}, -frac{1}{2a}right) and h'(x) > 0 in the interval left(-frac{1}{2a}, +inftyright). The minimum value of h(x) is therefore hleft(-frac{1}{2a}right), so we need hleft(-frac{1}{2a}right) > 0, which gives us 2aleft(-frac{1}{2a}right) - lnleft(-frac{1}{2a} + frac{1}{a}right) > 0, or equivalently, lnleft(frac{1}{2a}right) < -1.

Because -frac{1}{a} < x < 0, it follows that 0 < x^2 < frac{1}{a^2}, 0 < a^2x^2 < 1, and thus -1 < a^2x^2 - 1 < 0, which implies frac{2a}{a^2x^2 - 1} < -2a. Therefore, frac{2a}{a^2x^2 - 1} + 2a < 0, which means that g'(x) < 0. This shows that g(x) is a decreasing function on the interval (-frac{1}{a}, 0). Since -frac{1}{a} < x_1 < 0, it follows that g(x_1) > g(0) = 0. Therefore, f(-x_1) - f(x_1) > 0, and since f(x_1) = 0, f(-x_1) > 0 = f(x_2).

Label the vertices on the top of the cube ( A' ), ( B' ), ( C' ), and ( D' ) directly above the vertices ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), and ( D ), respectively. To ensure that every face of the cube has four differently colored corners, the color of each vertex on the top must be different from the colors of the two vertices on the bottom that share a face with it. 3. Consider the vertices adjacent to ( A' ) on the top face of the cube. These are: - Vertex ( B' ) - Vertex ( C' ) Since ( A' ) shares faces with ( A ) and ( B' ) or ( C ), vertex ( A' ) cannot be colored red ( (mathrm{R}) ), green ( (mathrm{G}) ), or blue ( (mathrm{B}) ). Therefore, ( A' ) must be purple ( (mathrm{P}) ). 4. Now consider vertex ( B' ).

Applying similar logic to the remaining vertices: - Vertex ( C' ) must be different from the colors of its adjacent vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( D ). Thus, ( C' ) must be green ( (mathrm{G}) ). - Vertex ( D' ) must be different from the colors on its adjacent bottom vertices, therefore, ( D' ) must be blue ( (mathrm{B}) ). 6. Since each of ( A' ), ( B' ), ( C' ), and ( D' ) is uniquely determined by the requirement that each face has four different colors, there is only one solution: - ( A' ): Purple ( (mathrm{P}) ) - ( B' ): Red ( (mathrm{R}) ) - ( C' ): Green ( (mathrm{G}) ) - ( D' ): Blue ( (mathrm{B}) ) In conclusion, the number of ways to color the top four corners of the cube so that every face has four different colored corners is [ boxed{1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the following propositions: 1.

Denote: - The point of tangency on side a as A_1. - The point of tangency on side b as B_1. - The point of tangency on side c as C_1. We need to show: 2s' geq s. To proceed, let's introduce some auxiliary variables and consider the properties of the tangents from a point to a circle: From the properties of tangents to a circle from a point, we know that the lengths of the tangents from one vertex are equal.

Then: [ begin{aligned} 2 max(alpha_i, beta_i, gamma_i) - left( max(alpha_i, beta_i) + max(beta_i, gamma_i) + max(gamma_i, alpha_i) right) &= 2gamma_i - (beta_i + gamma_i + gamma_i) = -beta_i, 2 min(alpha_i, beta_i, gamma_i) - left( min(alpha_i, beta_i) + min(beta_i, gamma_i) + min(gamma_i, alpha_i) right) &= 2alpha_i - (alpha_i + beta_i + alpha_i) = -beta_i. end{aligned} ] Both expressions simplify to (-beta_i), verifying our required equality. # Conclusion: The given equation is true, and hence we have successfully proved it.

We need to prove that it is possible to remove some of these runners such that the remaining ones do not overlap and cover at least half of the corridor. 2. **Reformulating the Problem**: The problem can be reformulated as: \\"We need to demonstrate that we can remove some runners such that the remaining runners cover the corridor in a single layer, and their total length is at least half of the total length of the corridor.\\" 3. **Labeling the Runners**: Number the runners from left to right in order of their left ends. 4. **Non-intersecting Runners**: Observe that by this numbering, no two runners with the same parity (odd or even index) will intersect. 5. **Segmentation into Two Groups**: Group the runners into two sets: those with odd indices and those with even indices. Since there is no overlap within these sets, the total coverage in each set will be the sum of the individual runner lengths within that set. 6. **Finding Maximum Coverage**: If we denote the total length of the corridor as ( L ), then the following two observations can be made: - The sum ( S_{text{odd}} ) of the lengths of all runners with odd indices. - The sum ( S_{text{even}} ) of the lengths of all runners with even indices. It must be true that ( L leq S_{text{odd}} + S_{text{even}} ). 7. **Ensuring Minimum Coverage**: To ensure that the remaining runners cover at least half the corridor, we can find the set (either all odd-indexed runners or all even-indexed runners) which has the greater sum.

Importantly, inversion preserves angles between intersecting curves (i.e., angle-preserving or conformal map), and for a circle or line not passing through the center, their images are other circles or lines, respectively. 2. **Application of Inversion for Triangle ABC**: Consider the triangle ABC with circumcircle k. The second intersection points of the lines AP, BP, CP with k are denoted by A_P, B_P, C_P respectively. 3. **Condition for Similarity of Triangles**: By the angle subtended by a chord theorem, the triangle A_PB_PP is similar to BAP.

If the trainee finds his or her own name by opening fewer than 22 drawers, they move to another room to wait for their friends. Otherwise, François kills everyone. Find a strategy that gives the trainees at least a 30 % chance of survival.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to find a strategy for the mathematicians that gives them at least a 30% chance of survival. Here is a detailed solution: 1. **Numbering Stagiaires and Drawers**: We start by numbering both the stagiaires and the drawers from 1 to 44. Hence, the situation can be understood in terms of permutations of the numbers 1 to 44. 2. **Permutation Representation**: Let's denote by ( p(i) ) the name (or index) in drawer ( i ). This means that ( p ) represents a permutation of the numbers 1 to 44. 3. **Stagiaire Strategy**: Each stagiaire ( i ) follows a specific strategy: - **Step 1**: Open drawer ( i ). - **Step 2**: If ( p(i) ) is not equal to ( i ), open drawer ( p(i) ). - **Step 3**: If ( p(p(i)) ) is not equal to ( i ), open drawer ( p(p(i)) ). - **Step 4**: Continue this process iteratively, where the ( k )-th drawer opened is ( p^{(k)}(i-1) ). 4. **Cycle Length Condition**: The crucial condition for all the stagiaires to survive is that the permutation ( p ) should not have any cycle longer than 22. This is because if there is a cycle longer than 22, at least one stagiaire will need to open more than 22 drawers to find his name, which leads to failure. 5. **Probabilities and Permutations**: We need to evaluate the probability that a random permutation of 44 elements has all cycles of length 22 or less. a. **Counting Permutations with a Long Cycle**: The number of permutations that have a cycle of length ( k ) (where ( k leq 44 ) and ( k geq 22 )) can be counted by choosing ( k ) elements out of 44 (which can be done in ( binom{44}{k} ) ways), then permuting the remaining 44 - ( k ) elements (which can be done in ( (44-k)! ) ways), and lastly choosing a specific cycle out of the ( k ) elements (which can be done in ( (k-1)! ) ways). Hence, the number of such permutations is: [ binom{44}{k}(44-k)!(k-1)! ] 6. **Summing Over All Valid ( k )**: The total probability of a permutation having a cycle of length above 22 is given by: [ frac{1}{44!} sum_{k=22}^{44} binom{44}{k} (44-k)! (k-1)! ] 7. **Simplifying the Probability Expression**: By simplification, this quantity becomes: [ sum_{k=22}^{44} frac{1}{k} ] Numerical evaluation shows that [ sum_{k=22}^{44} frac{1}{k} < 0.68 ] 8. **Survival Probability**: Hence, the probability that no cycle exceeds the length of 22 is at least: [ 1 - 0.68 = 0.32 ] In conclusion, the stagiaires have at least a 32% chance of survival by following the described strategy.

Since lambda overrightarrow {a}+ overrightarrow {b} is collinear with overrightarrow {c}=(-4,-7), we can assert that there exists a non-zero scalar k such that: k(lambda overrightarrow {a}+ overrightarrow {b}) = overrightarrow {c}, which translates into the equation: k(lambda + 2, 2lambda + 3) = (-4, -7).

A three-digit palindrome has the form of ABA, where A and B are digits, and A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and the last A is the units digit. 1. **Hundreds Digit (A):** Since the number must be between 100 and 500, the hundreds digit (A) can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This gives us 4 choices for the hundreds digit. 2. **Tens Digit (B):** The tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, regardless of what we chose for the hundreds digit. This gives us 10 choices for the tens digit. 3. **Units Digit (A):** The units digit must be the same as the hundreds digit to ensure the number is a palindrome. Therefore, once the hundreds digit is chosen, the units digit is fixed, and there are no additional choices to be made for the units digit. To find the total number of palindromes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit: - Hundreds digit: 4 choices - Tens digit: 10 choices - Units digit: Fixed by the choice of the hundreds digit, so effectively 1 choice.

We cannot use 0 in the ten thousands place, and since 0 is already used in a, we will use the next smallest digit, which is 2, in the ones place. Therefore, b would be 65432.

Specifically, angle ( PQF ) is equal to angle ( SRF ) and angle ( QPF ) is equal to angle ( RSF ). This similarity is due to the fact that both angles are subtended by the same arcs of the circle. - Therefore, corresponding sides of these triangles are proportional: [ frac{FQ}{QP} = frac{FR}{RS} ] 5. **Extend the Proportions to Involve Midpoints:** - From the proportionality of sides: [ frac{FQ}{FR} = frac{QP}{RS} = frac{QF_{1}}{RF_{2}} ] - This implies that triangles ( triangle F_{1}FQ ) and ( triangle F_{2}FR ) are also similar, because they share two pairs of equal angles and the ratio of their corresponding sides. 6. **Equal Angles and Circle Properties:** - The angle at ( F ) between ( OF ) and ( FN ) forms a right angle because ( F ) is the midpoint of the chord and ( OF ) is a radius perpendicular to the chord: [ angle OFN = 90^circ ] - Consequently, both quadrilaterals ( OFNF_{1} ) and ( OFHF_{2} ) are cyclic. 7. **Equal Angles in the Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** - Within the cyclic quadrilateral ( OFNF_{1} ) and ( OFHF_{2} ): - The angle ( angle NOF ) is equal to ( angle NF_{1}F ) and ( angle HOF ) is equal to ( angle HF_{2}F ), both marked as ( alpha ). - As ( triangle NOF ) is congruent to ( triangle HOF ), both share a side ( OF ) and angles ( 90^circ ) and ( alpha ).

The tangent point of this line to the curve y=ln x is at (m, ln m), and the tangent point to y=g(ax) is at (n, e^{an}). The derivative of y=ln x is y' = frac{1}{x}, and the derivative of y = e^{ax} is y' = ae^{ax}.

So for one round trip, the distance covered by one bird is 4D miles. Since each bird made 10 round trips, the distance covered by one bird for all the trips is 10 * 4D = 40D miles.

At the end of the tournament, it was found that there were 9 participants who scored no more than 4 points each. It is known that Petya scored exactly 9 points. How did he play against each of the remaining two chess players? (A win is 1 point, a draw is 0.5 points, and a loss is 0 points.) 1. Consider the nine participants mentioned in the problem who each scored no more than 4 points. 2. Among these 9 participants, each participated in binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36 games in total. - **Explanation:** Every pair among the 9 participants played exactly one game against each other. The number of such games is given by the combination formula binom{n}{2} for n=9 participants. 3. Each game has a total of 1 point to be distributed (either as 1 point to one participant and 0 points to the other or 0.5 points to each participant in case of a draw). Therefore, the total number of points distributed among these 9 participants in their games is 36 points. - **Calculation:** Each of the 9 participants scored no more than 4 points, and since the total distributed points are 36, if each participant had maximized, they could get exactly 4 points in this “subtournament”. 4. Since it’s stated that they each have at most 4 points, we conclude that all of their points come from the games played among the nine participants themselves. - **Implication:** This means that they must have each scored exactly 4 points from these games and lost all games they played against the remaining 3 players, including Petya. 5. Since Petya scored exactly 9 points, he must have obtained these points from his 11 games: - Petya would have earned 9 points from his 11 games, and he got 4 points from beating all 9 participants who scored no more than 4 points each since they each lost their game against him. 6. Therefore, the remaining 9 - 4 = 5 points must have resulted from his games against the remaining two participants and any other games he played. 7. Since a win is worth 1 point and a draw is worth 0.5 points, we analyze Petya’s remaining 2 games: - If Petya had won any of these games, he would have scored more than 9 points since he already collected full points from the 9 participants. - Therefore, Petya did not win either of the remaining two games. 8. Given that Petya did not draw either game, as getting any points would exceed 9, he must have lost both games against the remaining two participants. - **Conclusion:** Petya lost the two remaining games. # Conclusion: Petya lost both of his remaining games. boxed{text{Petya lost both}}"},{"prompt":"Let ABC be a triangle with BC > AC > AB .

Therefore, she saves 5,000 rubles each month. To maximize her income, Lena needs to use her bank's products effectively. She has a deposit account with a 1% monthly interest rate, a debit card with 8% annual interest on the minimum balance, and a credit card with a limit of 100,000 rubles and a 3% commission on withdrawals or transfers. 2. **Deposit Savings**: Lena should utilize the deposit account for savings as it has the highest return rate among the available bank products. Each month, after receiving her salary on the 6th, she will immediately transfer the 5,000 rubles she saves to this deposit account. The accumulated savings in the deposit account are subject to compound interest, calculated as follows: [ P_{text{total}} = 5000 sum_{k=0}^{11} (1.01)^k ] Evaluating the sum: [ sum_{k=0}^{11} (1.01)^k = 1 + 1.01 + 1.01^2 + ldots + 1.01^{11} ] This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and common ratio r = 1.01.

The total sum of all flat angles in a tetrahedron is the sum of the angles of four triangles, which is (4 times 180^circ = 720^circ). Hence, if the sum of the angles at every vertex is equal, each sum must be (frac{720^circ}{4} = 180^circ). 2. **Statement (6) implies Statement (5):** This is straightforward. If the sum of the flat angles at each vertex is 180°, then naturally, the sums at all four vertices are equal. 3. **Statement (4) implies Statement (8):** If the centers of the inscribed and circumscribed spheres coincide, then the point of tangency of the sphere with each face of the tetrahedron lies on the incircle of each triangular face. Each face must then be an acute-angled triangle with the radius of the circumcircle equal to (sqrt{R^2 - r^2}) where (R) is the radius of the circumscribed sphere and (r) is the radius of the inscribed sphere. 4. **Statement (8) implies Statement (4):** Any perpendicular from the center (O) of the circumscribed sphere to a face will hit the center of the face's circumcircle. If all these circumcircle radii are equal, then (O) must be equidistant from all faces (distance (sqrt{R^2 - r^2})). Thus, (O) is also the center of the inscribed sphere. 5. **Statement (8) implies Statement (6):** If all triangular faces have the same circumradius, we use geometric properties to show that each set of opposite face angles are equal, summing to 180° for the triangles formed at each vertex. This leads to all exterior angles summing correctly for every vertex. 6. **Statement (6) implies Statement (7):** The development (or unfolding) of a regular tetrahedron onto a plane will be a set of triangles such that lines through the midpoints (formed by shared edges between triangles) are collinear. This ensures that the development is an acute-angled triangle with medians corresponding to the tetrahedron's edges. 7. **Statement (7) implies Statement (8) and Statement (2), Statement (2) implies Statement (3), Statement (3) implies Statement (1):** These implications can be observed directly from the regular properties of tetrahedron configurations and standard geometric proofs. 8. **Statement (1) implies Statement (9):** If all edges and faces are equal, the projections of the tetrahedron onto the planes parallel to any pair of opposite edges will result in symmetrical rectangles due to the equal edge lengths. 9. **Statement (9) implies Statement (7):** This is evident as the projections (rectangles) ensure the same triangular face sums for development. 10. **Statement (14) implies Statement (3):** If the sum of the flat angles at any three vertices equals 180°, it necessitates the fourth to have the resulting sum, ensuring all triangular faces must be equivalent equilateral triangles for balance. 11. **Statement (3) implies Statement (14):** This inference becomes obvious by the sum of flat angles in regular triangles. 12. **Statement (15) implies Statement (3):** Following a similar approach as in (14), verifications using angle sums and symmetrical properties hold. 13. **Statement (1) implies Statement (11):** A regular tetrahedron has congruent altitudes due to symmetry in equidistant vertices from opposite faces. 14. **Statement (2) implies Statement (10):** Pairing opposite edges uniformly extends to forming a rectangular parallelepiped. 15. **Statement (10) implies Statement (12):** Within a rectangular parallelepiped, the simultaneous median intersections align with sphere center per conditions in (10). 16. **Statement (12) implies Statement (10):** The center of the inscribed sphere coinciding with all diagonal halves implies regularity extending to rectangular parallelepiped formations. 17. **Statement (13) implies Statement (11):** Equality of radians and regular divisions ensure the spherical center coinciding fits with uniform axioms guaranteeing equal altitudes. **Conclusion:** All these properties basically characterize a regular tetrahedron as being equivalently expressible by the given statements and their mutual implications. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Given a quadratic function of y with respect to x, y=2mx^{2}+left(1mright)x1m, which of the following conclusions is correct? ① When m=1, the coordinates of the vertex of the function graph are (frac{1}{2},frac{1}{2}); ② When mneq 0, the function graph always passes through a fixed point; ③ When m gt 0, the length of the segment intercepted by the function graph on the xaxis is greater than frac{3}{2}; ④ If any two different points P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2}) are taken on the function graph, then when m lt 0, the inequality frac{{y}_{2}{y}_{1}}{{x}_{2}{x}_{1}} lt 0 is always true for x gt frac{1}{4}.

Can we start from the configuration where every square is in its place and end at the configuration where 15 and 14 are swapped while the others remain in place? We specify that a move consists of moving the hole to a neighboring horizontal or vertical space.","completion":"1. **Initial and Final Parities:** Consider the configurations of the Taquin game. The starting configuration is where all squares are in their original positions from 1 to 15, with one empty space. The final configuration is where we have exchanged the positions of squares 14 and 15, leaving all other squares in place. Next, observe the concept of parity (evenness or oddness) in permutations. At the beginning, the puzzle is in an ordered state with an even permutation (parity is even). Swap any two squares (in this case, 14 and 15), and we alter the parity from even to odd. Therefore, we need an odd permutation to transition from an even-numbered initial state to an odd-numbered final state. 2. **Signature and Transpositions:** Each move in the Taquin game can be considered a transposition, i.e., swapping two adjacent squares by moving the empty space. Each transposition changes the permutation's signature by -1 (an odd permutation). This means every move switches parity between odd and even. Given that changing the permutation of the squares involves repeatedly altering the parity through transpositions, an odd number of moves must accompany the parity shift from even (initial) to odd (final). 3. **Chessboard Coloring Argument:** To understand the movement of the empty space, imagine coloring the positions on the 4x4 grid in the style of a chessboard where alternate squares are of different colors. - Color the squares alternately with two colors, say black and white, such that no two adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically) have the same color. - Given this coloring, any legal move of the empty space (a movement to a neighbor square) results in the empty space transitioning from one color to the other. At every move, the empty space changes from a black square to a white square or vice versa. Consequently, if the empty space starts on a black square, it must return to a black square after an even number of moves and to a white square after an odd number of moves. 4. **Initial and Final Colors:** In the starting configuration, note whether the empty space's position (e.g., bottom-right corner) is on a black or white square. In the desired final configuration (after swapping 14 and 15), the empty space should still occupy a square of the same color as initially. Since moving the empty space changes its color each time, ending up on the same colored square indicates an even number of moves. This contradicts the requirement from the permutation parity argument wherein an odd number of moves is needed to reach the final state. **Conclusion:** This contradiction implies that there is no sequence of legitimate moves that can transform the initial configuration into the final one while obeying the puzzle's constraints. Hence, it is impossible to achieve the goal of swapping the positions of the 14 and 15 squares (without disturbing the positions of the other squares) in the Taquin game.

Loss on the first book = 15% of Rs. 175 Loss on the first book = 0.15 * 175 Loss on the first book = Rs. 26.25 Selling price of the first book = Cost price of the first book - Loss on the first book Selling price of the first book = Rs. 175 - Rs. 26.25 Selling price of the first book = Rs. 148.75 Now, let's calculate the selling price of the book sold at a gain. The total cost of both books is Rs. 300, and we know the cost of the first book is Rs. 175, so the cost of the second book is: Cost of the second book = Total cost - Cost of the first book Cost of the second book = Rs. 300 - Rs. 175 Cost of the second book = Rs. 125 The second book was sold at a gain of 19%. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 19% of Rs. 125 and then add that to Rs. 125. Gain on the second book = 19% of Rs. 125 Gain on the second book = 0.19 * 125 Gain on the second book = Rs. 23.75 Selling price of the second book = Cost price of the second book + Gain on the second book Selling price of the second book = Rs. 125 + Rs. 23.75 Selling price of the second book = Rs. 148.75 Now, let's find the total selling price of both books: Total selling price = Selling price of the first book + Selling price of the second book Total selling price = Rs. 148.75 + Rs. 148.75 Total selling price = Rs. 297.50 Therefore, both books were sold for a total of Rs. boxed{297.50} ."},{"prompt":"Find the area of the triangle with vertices (2, 3), (0, 4), and (3, 1).","completion":"Let A = (2, -3), B = (0, 4), and C = (3, -1).

A vertex of the polygon that belongs to only one parallelogram is called a good vertex. Prove that there are at least three good vertices.","completion":"1. Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as ( n ). 2. The sum of the interior angles of an ( n )-sided polygon is given by the formula: [ text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^circ cdot (n-2). ] This is derived from the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is ((n-2) cdot 180^circ). 3. In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than ( 180^circ ). 4. Next, note that each parallelogram within the polygon contributes four angles that sum to ( 360^circ ) (since the sum of angles in any quadrilateral is ( 360^circ )). 5. Let's count the angles in another way: For each side of the polygon, there are exactly two angles from the parallelograms that are adjacent to that side. This is because each side of the polygon is shared by two parallelograms. The sum of the angles corresponding to each side of the polygon is thus: [ text{Sum of parallelogram angles adjacent to sides} = 2 cdot 180^circ cdot n = 180^circ cdot n. ] 6. We now compare this sum to the sum of the polygon’s interior angles. Clearly, the total sum of the parallelograms' interior angles, accounted in this pairwise manner, exceeds the polygon's actual interior angles by: [ text{Excess} = 180^circ cdot n - 180^circ cdot (n-2) = 180^circ cdot (n - (n-2)) = 180^circ cdot 2 = 360^circ. ] 7. The excess of ( 360^circ ) arises precisely because we have added ( 180^circ ) more than the actual contribution due to the corners (i.e., some angles have been counted twice). 8. The \\"good\\" vertices (those counted more than once) are specifically the vertices that: - belong to exactly one parallelogram each, - and their angles are counted less than the total angles around them. 9. Therefore, each of these vertices contributes less than ( 180^circ ) individually but fit into the overall calculation for the parallelogram sum. There must be at least ( lceil frac{360^circ}{180^circ} rceil = 2 ) such vertices in any configuration, but due to the requirement of forming convex shapes through triangulation and division into parallelograms, at least three good vertices are necessary to maintain the overall shape. 10.

According to the information given: - 22% of the customers are caught sampling the candy. This means 22 customers are caught and fined. - 12% of the customers who sample the candy are not caught.

The safest time to start would be right after the initial eruption, which is at 1 pm (13:00). - From 13:00 to 14:00, it's safe (because the first crater just erupted and will be silent for 17 hours). - He will have 20 hours of non-eruption from the first crater (from 13:00 to 9:00 the next day), while his total journey only requires 16 hours. 6. **Path Timing with Second Crater:** To ensure Vanya doesn’t hit the eruption of the second crater while on the path: - He can safely travel the path 8 hours from when he hits it. Since the initial eruptions are synced, starting at 13:00 means he will hit the path at approximately 17:00 (13:00 + 4 hours). - By starting at 13:00, he will therefore avoid any eruption of the second crater on the path since the next eruption cycle for the second crater will be at 22:00, beyond the critical 8-hour window. 7. **Computation of All Times Aligning:** We check if starting at 38 hours after the eruptions sync up will hit any eruptions. 8. **Confirming 50-hour synchronization:** The least common multiple of 18 and 10 is 90. This means the eruptions only sync together every 90 hours if Vanya ensures he remains within a synchronized safety window from the initial start point. So, starting at 38 past any synchronized hourly mark combined with the ensuring crater-specific eruption windows and total non-eruption journey time confirms safety parameters—for example, starting at the end of 37th hour, start of 38th hour from any cycle point (such as starting from 50-hour cycles).

Consider a general solution: [ x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n} = a ] From the second and third equations: [ x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + cdots + x_{n}^{2} = a^{2} ] [ x_{1}^{3} + x_{2}^{3} + cdots + x_{n}^{3} = a^{3} ] If ( a = 0 ), then: [ left{ begin{array}{c} x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n} = 0 x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + cdots + x_{n}^{2} = 0 end{array} right. ] This implies ( x_{i} = 0 ) for all ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ). If ( a neq 0 ), define ( t_i = frac{x_i}{a} ). Hence, we have: [ t_{1} + t_{2} + cdots + t_{n} = 1 ] [ t_{1}^{2} + t_{2}^{2} + cdots + t_{n}^{2} = 1 ] Note that ( |t_i| leq 1 ). Also, ( sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}^{3} leq sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}^{2} = 1 ). Since ( sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}^{3} = 1 ), it follows ( t_{i}^{3} = t_i^{2} ). Therefore, ( t_i = 0 ) or ( t_i = 1 ), implying ( x_i = 0 ) or ( x_i = a ).

Prove that if the number of points marked -1 is at most 672, then there is at least one good point on the circumference. The problem can be generalized as follows: for (3n + 1) points where (n) of them are marked as -1, it must be shown that there exists at least one good point on the circle. 1. **Base Case: (n = 1):** - When (n = 1), there are (3n + 1 = 4) points, one of which is marked -1, and the remaining three are marked +1. - The possible arrangements are three +1 marks surrounding one -1 mark. - Since the total sum of the values is (+2), which is positive, moving in any direction will always yield a positive sum. - Therefore, there is at least one good point.

These intersections can be visualized in a grid layout. 4. **Street Calculation**: - If the tourist visits each new intersection just once, the total number of streets passed including the starting point will be number of intersections minus one: [ text{Number of Streets} = 36 - 1 = 35 text{ streets} ] This is the theoretical maximum streets covered without passing the same intersection again. 5. **Route Constraints**: - To determine if 35 streets can indeed be covered whilst conforming to tourist constraints, consider the pattern of movement. - Each new street leads to a different intersection and alternates between intersections. 6. **Coloring Argument**: - Color the intersections in a checkerboard sequence. For simplicity, let’s categorize all intersections into two sets: - Color black and color white, in a grid pattern (like a chessboard). - According to the coloring, each move from one intersection to another will change the color of the intersection the tourist is on. - The starting intersection (A) and the ending intersection (B) are both on white intersections in the diagram provided. 7. **Route Parity Constraint**: - With (A) and (B) both white, the number of streets for any valid route must be even since it begins and ends on the same color. - However, 35 is an odd number which invalidates any possibility for the tourist to cover exactly 35 streets without repeating an intersection. 8. **Conclusion**: - Since only even numbers of street can validate starting and ending at white, the highest valid number without repeating intersections is thus (34).

At x = 1, f(x) is minimal, so we can solve for f(1) = (1-(m-1))^2 - 1 = (2-m)^2 - 1 geq 3. This yields m leq 0 or m geq 4. Given that m < 2, we keep boxed{m leq 0}. - When 1 leq m-1 leq 3, i.e., 2 leq m leq 4, the parabola has a minimum at x = m-1, where f(x) = -1. Clearly, -1 notgeq 3, so no values of m in this range satisfy the condition. - When m-1 > 3, i.e., m > 4, f(x) is decreasing on [1, 3]. At x = 3, f(x) is minimal, so we can solve for f(3) = (3 - (m-1))^2 - 1 = (4-m)^2 - 1 geq 3. This yields m leq 2 or m geq 6. Given that m > 4, we keep boxed{m geq 6}.

Then the segment DY will equal the segment DX because both X and Y are midpoints of segments connecting D to P. 2. **Parallelogram Formation**: Note that the quadrilateral ( DYPX ) forms a parallelogram because the diagonals bisect each other. Specifically, DX = DY and since D is the midpoint of AB, DA = DB. 3. **Finding Circumcenters**: - The circumcenter of triangle ( triangle APM ) is X because X is the midpoint of AP and equidistant from both endpoints A and M. - Similarly, the circumcenter of triangle ( triangle BPL ) is Y as Y is the midpoint of BP and equidistant from both endpoints B and L. 4. **Equalities in Lengths**: The distances XM and YP are equal (since both are circumradii of their respective triangles). Thus, XM = XP = DY and YL = YP = DX. 5. **Angle Calculations**: We will show that angle DXL = angle DYL.

First, we need to convert the length of the trains into kilometers because the speed is given in km/hr. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the length of each train in kilometers is: 80 meters = 80 / 1000 kilometers 80 meters = 0.08 kilometers Since both trains are of the same length, the total distance the faster train needs to cover to pass the slower train is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of faster train + Length of slower train Total distance = 0.08 km + 0.08 km Total distance = 0.16 km The relative speed is the difference in speed between the two trains. Since the slower train is moving at 36 km/hr, the relative speed (R) in km/hr at which the faster train passes the slower train is: R = V - 36 Now, we need to convert the time it takes to pass the slower train into hours because the speed is in km/hr.

To find the area of the pentagon EFGHI, we use the formula (12+6 div 2-1) times 2. Let's break down this expression step-by-step: [ 12 + 6 div 2 - 1 ] First, perform the division: [ 6 div 2 = 3 ] Then, substitute back into the expression: [ 12 + 3 - 1 ] Continue with the addition and subtraction: [ 12 + 3 = 15 ] [ 15 - 1 = 14 ] 4.

The goal is to determine the angle ( theta ) that maximizes the horizontal range. 1. **Determine the time of flight:** The vertical motion of the projectile is governed by the equation: [ y(t) = v_0 sin theta cdot t - frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] where ( y(t) ) is the vertical position at time ( t ), ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity, and ( t ) is the time of flight. The projectile hits the ground when ( y(t) = -h ): [ -h = v_0 sin theta cdot t - frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] Rearranging this quadratic equation, we get: [ frac{1}{2} g t^2 - v_0 sin theta cdot t - h = 0 ] Solving for ( t ) using the quadratic formula ( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = frac{1}{2} g ), ( b = -v_0 sin theta ), and ( c = -h ): [ t = frac{v_0 sin theta pm sqrt{(v_0 sin theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g} ] We take the positive root since time cannot be negative: [ t = frac{v_0 sin theta + sqrt{(v_0 sin theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g} ] 2. **Determine the horizontal range:** The horizontal range ( R ) is given by the horizontal velocity multiplied by the time of flight: [ R = v_0 cos theta cdot t ] Substituting the expression for ( t ): [ R = v_0 cos theta cdot frac{v_0 sin theta + sqrt{(v_0 sin theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g} ] Simplifying, we get: [ R = frac{v_0^2 sin theta cos theta}{g} + frac{v_0 cos theta sqrt{(v_0 sin theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g} ] 3. **Analyze the range for different values of ( h ):** - When ( h approx 0 ), the range equation simplifies to the standard projectile range on level ground: [ R = frac{v_0^2 sin 2theta}{g} ] The range is maximized when ( theta = 45^circ ). - When ( h ) is very large, the term ( sqrt{(v_0 sin theta)^2 + 2gh} ) dominates. In this case, the horizontal range is maximized by maximizing the horizontal component of the initial velocity, which occurs when ( theta ) is close to ( 0^circ ). 4. **Conclusion:** By continuity, for intermediate values of ( h ), the optimal angle ( theta ) lies between ( 0^circ ) and ( 45^circ ). Therefore, the angle ( theta ) that maximizes the horizontal range is in the interval ( 0^circ < theta < 45^circ ).

B can complete the work in 10 days, which means B's daily work rate is 1/10 of the work per day. A can complete the work in 15 days, which means A's daily work rate is 1/15 of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined daily work rate is: (1/10) + (1/15) = (3/30) + (2/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 of the work per day. This means that A and B together can complete the work in 6 days. Now, let's find out the ratio of the work done by A and B when they work together: A's share of work per day: 1/15 B's share of work per day: 1/10 The ratio of A's work to B's work per day is: (1/15) / (1/10) = (1/15) * (10/1) = 10/15 = 2/3 So, for every 2 units of work A does, B does 3 units of work. The total units of work done by A and B together is 2 + 3 = 5 units. Now, we know that B should be paid Rs 3333 for his share of the work, which corresponds to 3 units of the total 5 units of work done by both. To find the value of 1 unit of work, we divide B's wages by 3: Rs 3333 / 3 = Rs 1111 per unit of work.

Notice that if ( x a equiv y a pmod{p} ), then: x a - y a equiv 0 pmod{p} which implies: (x - y) a equiv 0 pmod{p} 2. **Step 2: Understanding Divisibility** Since ( (x - y)a equiv 0 pmod{p} ), we can say that ( p ) divides ( (x - y)a ). Because ( p ) is a prime number and ( a ) is not divisible by ( p ), ( a ) has a multiplicative inverse modulo ( p ). According to the properties of prime numbers and gcd (greatest common divisor), since ( p ) and ( a ) are coprime, this implies: gcd(a, p) = 1 This means ( a ) and ( p ) are relatively prime. 3. **Step 3: Canceling the Common Factor** Given that ( p mid (x - y)a ) and knowing that ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), it follows that ( p mid (x - y) ). Therefore, ( x - y ) must be a multiple of ( p ). 4. **Step 4: Analyzing the Range of ( x ) and ( y )** Since ( x ) and ( y ) are confined to the range ( 1 leq x, y leq p - 1 ), the only possible multiple of ( p ) within this range is zero (since ( x ) and ( y ) can only be between 1 and ( p-1 )). Thus, we have: x - y = 0 quad Rightarrow quad x = y 5. **Conclusion: Uniqueness of Remainders** This implies that if ( x neq y ), ( xa notequiv ya pmod{p} ). Therefore, the remainders ( {a, 2a, 3a, ldots, (p-1)a} ) modulo ( p ) are all distinct. Since there are ( p-1 ) numbers in this set and they all yield distinct remainders when taken modulo ( p ), each number ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ) must appear exactly once as a remainder. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the molecular weight of a compound with the formula N2O5.

So, the number of parrots is (3/5)B and the number of toucans is B - (3/5)B = (2/5)B. We are told that 3/4 of the toucans are female. Therefore, the number of female toucans is (3/4) * (2/5)B = (3/10)B. Let's denote the fraction of the parrots that are female as F. So, the number of female parrots is F * (3/5)B. The total number of female birds is the sum of female parrots and female toucans, which is F * (3/5)B + (3/10)B. We are also told that 0.5 fraction of the birds in the tree are male. This means that the other 0.5 fraction of the birds are female. So, the total number of female birds is also (1/2)B. Setting the two expressions for the total number of female birds equal to each other, we get: F * (3/5)B + (3/10)B = (1/2)B To solve for F, we can divide both sides of the equation by B to get rid of the B term: F * (3/5) + (3/10) = (1/2) Now, we need to solve for F. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to get rid of the fractions: 10 * [F * (3/5) + (3/10)] = 10 * (1/2) This simplifies to: 6F + 3 = 5 Subtract 3 from both sides: 6F = 2 Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for F: F = 2/6 Simplify the fraction: F = 1/3 So, boxed{1/3} of the parrots are female."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) have a derivative, and satisfy lim_{Delta x to 0} frac{f(1)f(12Delta x)}{2Delta x}=1.

Note that ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ) implies ( x > 2 ) and ( x ) is not a perfect square. - Write ( x = a^2 + b ) with ( (a, b) in mathbb{N}^2 ) and ( b leq 2a ). - Then, ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ) if and only if ( a^2 + b - a sqrt{a^2 + b} > frac{5}{2} ). - This simplifies to ( a^2 + b - frac{5}{2} > sqrt{(a^2)^2 + a^2 b} ). - Squaring both sides, we get ( (b - frac{5}{2})^2 > (5 - b) a^2 ). 4. **Analyzing the Inequality:** - If ( b leq 4 ), then ( frac{(b - frac{5}{2})^2}{5 - b} leq (b - frac{5}{2})^2 leq frac{9}{4} < 4 leq (2b)^2 ), so ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ) cannot hold. - If ( b geq 5 ), then any such ( x ) satisfies ( sqrt{x} left{ sqrt{x} right} > frac{5}{2} ). 5. **Application to the Problem:** - Consider ( x = n^2 d ) for ( d ) non-square.

Since (c > 2), we have (c/2 > 1). The series (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^p}) converges for (p > 1). Therefore, (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^{c/2}}) converges. 3. **Defining a Bound:** - Let (C = sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^{c/2}}). Since the series is convergent, (C) is a finite positive number. 4. **Using the Given Conditions to Bound (a(n)):** - We will use induction and the given conditions to show that (a(n)) is bounded by a constant multiple of (C^2). 5. **Base Case:** - For (n = 2^k), we have (a(2^k) leq frac{1}{(k+1)^c}). 6. **Inductive Step:** - Assume that for all (m < n), (a(m) leq 2C^2). - We need to show that (a(n) leq 2C^2). - Write (n) in binary form: (n = 2^{i_1} + 2^{i_2} + cdots + 2^{i_k}) where (i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_k). - Using the given condition (a(m+n) leq 2a(m) + 2a(n)), we can recursively apply this to break down (a(n)) into sums of (a(2^i)). 7. **Bounding (a(n)) Using the Binary Representation:** - For (n = 2^{i_1} + 2^{i_2} + cdots + 2^{i_k}), we have: [ a(n) leq 2(a(2^{i_1}) + a(2^{i_2}) + cdots + a(2^{i_k})) ] - Using the bound (a(2^i) leq frac{1}{(i+1)^c}), we get: [ a(n) leq 2 left( frac{1}{(i_1+1)^c} + frac{1}{(i_2+1)^c} + cdots + frac{1}{(i_k+1)^c} right) ] 8. **Summing the Series:** - Since (i_1, i_2, ldots, i_k) are distinct and each term (frac{1}{(i+1)^c}) is part of the convergent series (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i^c}), we can bound the sum by (C): [ a(n) leq 2 sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{1}{(i+1)^c} leq 2C ] 9. **Final Bound:** - Since (C) is a finite constant, we have: [ a(n) leq 2C^2 ] - Therefore, the sequence (a(n)) is bounded by (2C^2).

We denote these roots by (a), (b), and (c). 2. **Application of Vieta's Formulas**: Given the cubic polynomial (f(x) = x^3 + px^2 + qx + r), where (a, b, c) are the roots, Vieta's formulas give us the relationships: [ a + b + c = -p, ] [ ab + bc + ca = q, ] [ abc = -r. ] Since (a, b, c) are roots of a polynomial with rational coefficients, (a + b + c, ab + bc + ca,) and (abc) are all rational. 3. **Area of the Triangle ((S)) Using Heron's formula**: The semi-perimeter (p) of the triangle is: [ p = frac{a + b + c}{2}. ] Heron's formula for the area (S) of the triangle is: [ S = sqrt{p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)}. ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ S^2 = p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c). ] Since (p), (p-a), (p-b), and (p-c) are rational, (S^2) is also rational. 4. **Calculation of Heights**: The heights of the triangle (h_a), (h_b), and (h_c) are given by: [ h_a = frac{2S}{a}, quad h_b = frac{2S}{b}, quad h_c = frac{2S}{c}. ] Squaring these values, we have: [ h_a^2 = frac{4S^2}{a^2}, quad h_b^2 = frac{4S^2}{b^2}, quad h_c^2 = frac{4S^2}{c^2}. ] 5. **Forming the Polynomial Coefficients**: Consider the polynomial whose roots are (h_a^2, h_b^2, h_c^2).

This is because for two sets to be equal, every element of one set must be an element of the other set and vice versa. Step 1: Matching elements of the sets, we get: - One of the elements of the first set must match 0, the only option for this is frac{b}{a} = 0 since a and 1 cannot be 0. - Since a^2 is an element of the second set and it's not 0, it must match either a or 1. It cannot match a because a is already matched with a+b. Therefore, a^2 = 1. - By elimination, a must match with a+b, which gives us the third equation. Step 2: Solving the system of equations: - From frac{b}{a} = 0, we multiply both sides by a to get b = 0. - From a = a + b, substituting b = 0, we get a = a, which is always true and does not provide new information. - From a^2 = 1, taking the square root of both sides, we find a = 1 or a = -1. Step 3: Checking the solutions: - For a = 1 and b = 0, we see that the set {a, frac{b}{a}, 1} would be {1, 0, 1}, which does not satisfy the condition of distinct elements in the set. - For a = -1 and b = 0, the set {a, frac{b}{a}, 1} becomes {-1, 0, 1}, which satisfies the condition of distinct elements.

Petya erased some of these numbers, leaving a subset where no number divides the difference between any two others. 2. We aim to find the maximum number of numbers that could remain on the board under such a condition. 3. Observe that the difference between any two even numbers is even, and the difference between any two odd numbers is also even. The difference between an even and an odd number is odd. Therefore, if we only consider the odd numbers, the difference between any two odd numbers will be even. 4. We need to ensure that no number divides the difference between any pair of remaining numbers. We note that the set of all odd numbers up to 235 is: [ {1, 3, 5, ldots, 235} ] 5.

Applying the Pigeonhole Principle, if we have 119 or more numbers, at least one pair will contain both numbers in the final selection, which means this pair would include two consecutive numbers. 9. For these two consecutive numbers, the difference is 1. The number 1 is a divisor of any number, violating the condition that no number divides the difference of any two others. Thus, it's not possible to have 119 or more numbers without violating the given condition. 10.

This implies that the circle ( f(Delta) ) must be invariant under similarity transformations, which include rotations, translations, reflections, and dilations. 2. **Condition (b) and Common Intersection Point:** - For any four points ( A, B, C, D ) in general position, the circles ( f(ABC), f(BCD), f(CDA), ) and ( f(DAB) ) must intersect at a common point. This condition suggests a strong geometric property that these circles share, which is typically seen in the context of the nine-point circle (Euler circle) of a triangle. 3. **Reflection and Intersection Properties:** - Consider a kite formed by points ( A, B, C, D ) such that ( AB = AD ) and ( BC = CD ). If ( f(ABC) ) does not intersect the line ( AC ), then ( f(ABC) cap f(ADC) = emptyset ), which contradicts condition (b). Therefore, ( f(ABC) ) must intersect the line ( AC ), and similarly, it must intersect the lines ( AB ) and ( BC ). 4. **Parallelogram and Midpoints:** - For a parallelogram ( ABCD ), the circles ( f(ABC) ) and ( f(ADC) ) must intersect at the midpoint ( M ) of ( AC ). This is because ( M ) is the point of reflection symmetry for the triangles ( Delta ABC ) and ( Delta CDA ). The radical axis of these circles passes through ( M ). 5. **Radical Center Theorem:** - By the Radical Center Theorem, the radical axes of the circles ( f(ABC), f(BCD), f(CDA), ) and ( f(DAB) ) intersect at a common point.

Given that ( f(ABC) ) intersects the midpoints of ( ABC ), it must be the Euler circle of ( Delta ABC ). 7. **General Quadrilateral:** - For any quadrilateral ( ABCD ), the Euler circles of ( Delta ABC, Delta ABD, Delta ACD, Delta BCD ) intersect at a common point. This common point is the nine-point center of the triangles formed by the vertices of the quadrilateral. 8. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** - To prove that the Euler circles intersect at a common point, consider the midpoints ( H, G, J, I, E, F ) of the sides of the triangles. The intersection point ( K ) of the circles ( (HFG) ) and ( (FIJ) ) must lie on the Euler circle. By showing that ( HEKI ) is cyclic, we establish that the Euler circles intersect at a common point. 9. **Angle Chasing:** - Using angle chasing, we show that ( angle HKI = angle HAI = angle HEI ), which implies that ( HEKI ) is cyclic. Similarly, ( GEKJ ) is cyclic, confirming that the Euler circles intersect at a common point. Conclusion: Thus, for any triangle ( Delta ), the circle ( f(Delta) ) is the Euler circle of ( Delta ).

Then, combine this with the fact that the distance from point A to the directrix of the parabola C_{1} is p to obtain frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}=frac{1}{4}. Substitute this into the formula for calculating the eccentricity to get the answer. **Solution** Take one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola: y=frac{b}{a}x. Solving the system of equations begin{cases}y^{2}=2px y=frac{b}{a}xend{cases} gives begin{cases}x=frac{2pa^{2}}{b^{2}} y=frac{2pa}{b}end{cases}. So, A(frac{2pa^{2}}{b^{2}},frac{2pa}{b}).

Since A can finish the work in 12 days, A's work rate is ( frac{1}{12} ) of the work per day.

Since a_1 + 1, a_3 + 3, and a_5 + 5 form a geometric sequence, we can write: (a_3 + 3)^2 = (a_1 + 1)(a_5 + 5). This can be simplified to: a_3^2 + 6a_3 + 9 = a_1 a_5 + 5a_1 + 5a_5 + 5. Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, we know that a_3 = a_1 + 2d and a_5 = a_1 + 4d. Plugging these into our equation, we get: (a_1 + 2d)^2 + 6(a_1 + 2d) + 9 = a_1(a_1 + 4d) + 5a_1 + 5(a_1 + 4d) + 5.

(Assume that the order of the cards does not matter.)","completion":"To solve this problem, we break it down into two main steps: choosing the suits and then choosing the cards from those suits. **Step 1: Choosing the Suits** - Since we need to choose 3 cards of different suits from a standard deck of 52 cards, which contains 4 suits, we start by selecting 3 out of these 4 suits. - The number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 is calculated using the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. - Substituting n=4 and r=3, we get binom{4}{3} = frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4. **Step 2: Choosing the Cards** - After selecting the suits, we need to choose one card from each of these suits. Since each suit has 13 cards, and we are choosing one card from each of the 3 chosen suits, the number of ways to do this is 13^3. - Calculating 13^3 gives us 13 times 13 times 13 = 2197 ways. **Combining the Steps** - To find the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits, we multiply the number of ways to choose the suits by the number of ways to choose the cards within those suits. - This gives us 4 cdot 2197 = 8788.

Therefore, the number of possible outcomes for both draws is (52 times 52 = 2704). 2. **Calculating the Probability of Drawing Two Cards of the Same Suit:** If the first card is drawn, there are 12 other cards of the same suit left in the deck.

If A cap B = emptyset, find the range of the real number m.","completion":"Since A cap B = emptyset, no solutions to the equation x^2 + x + m + 2 = 0 can be positive. Therefore, any solution x must be non-positive. Let's analyze the quadratic equation: x^2 + x + m + 2 = 0. For the solutions of this equation to be non-positive, the equation must not have any real roots greater than zero. To determine this, we check the discriminant of the quadratic equation: Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (1)^2 - 4(1)(m + 2). For there to be no positive roots, the roots must either be both negative or complex. Thus, the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero: Delta = 1 - 4(m + 2) leq 0. Solving for m yields: 1 - 4m - 8 leq 0, -4m leq 7, m geq -frac{7}{4}. However, this condition only ensures the roots are not real and positive. We need to further ensure that if there are real roots, they are both non-positive. The sum of the roots of the quadratic equation is given by -frac{b}{a}, which in our case is -frac{1}{1} = -1. Since the average of the roots is negative, if the roots are real, they must both be negative or zero. Therefore, the equation will have no solutions in set B (no positive solutions) if m geq -frac{7}{4}. However, we must not forget to verify the original equation x^2 + x + m + 2 = 0 specifically at x = 0 since A includes solutions that are non-positive (zero included), and B is strictly positive. Substituting x = 0 into the equation, we get: 0^2 + 0 + m + 2 = 0, m + 2 = 0, m = -2. Therefore, to ensure that the intersection of set A and B is empty, m must be less than or equal to -2. Thus, the range of m is: m leq -2. To conclude: boxed{m leq -2}."},{"prompt":"their first terms, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins.

Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses in total. 2. Governor Hawkins gave half as many as Governor Sandoval, so Governor Hawkins gave 12 / 2 = 6 commencement addresses. 3. Governor Sloan gave 10 more than Governor Sandoval, so Governor Sloan gave 12 + 10 = 22 commencement addresses. 4. On rainy days, each governor gave one less commencement address than normal. Since Governor Sandoval gave 5 speeches on rainy days, we subtract 5 from his total, leaving him with 12 - 5 = 7 non-rainy day addresses. 5. Governor Davenport gave three less than the average of Governor Sandoval and Governor Sloan's non-rainy day addresses. Since we only have the non-rainy day total for Governor Sandoval (7), we need to find out how many rainy day addresses Governor Sloan gave to find his non-rainy day total. However, we are not given the number of rainy day addresses for Governor Sloan, so we will assume that the number of addresses given by Governor Sloan (22) is the total number, including both rainy and non-rainy days. 6. The average of Governor Sandoval and Governor Sloan's non-rainy day addresses is (7 + 22) / 2 = 29 / 2 = 14.5. 7.

Each pair of these numbers can form one difference. As there are (binom{9}{2}) ways to choose 2 numbers out of 9: [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36 ] Hence, the number of pairwise differences is 36. 2. **Determine the range of possible pairwise differences:** The smallest possible difference (in absolute value) between any two numbers is (1), and the largest possible difference (in absolute value) is (18) (since the largest and smallest numbers must be between 1 and 19). Thus, the possible absolute values of differences lie in the range 1 to 18. In total, there are 18 possible values for the absolute differences. 3. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:** Given that we need to place these 36 differences into 18 different buckets (the absolute values of the differences), we can observe the following: According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we have more items than bins and distribute the items among the bins, at least one bin must contain more than one item. In this case, we have: [ 36 text{ differences} > 2 times 18 text{ buckets} ] This means there must be some absolute difference value that appears at least thrice. 4. **Account for the difference of 18 being unique:** The difference of 18 can only occur in one specific way, namely: [ 18 = 19 - 1 ] Therefore, it is unique and doesn’t repeat three times. 5. **Conclusion based on pigeonholing:** Because we cannot have the difference of 18 showing up three times, the argument implies that some other differences must occur at least three times among the possible differences. This ensures that at least one absolute difference appears in at least three different pairs. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"The sum of the prices of an apple and a pear is 15,000 won.

Consider the implications of Statement 1 and Statement 2 together. Lev cannot consistently state both on any given day, as this would create a paradox. Let's examine this in more detail: - **Case 1**: Suppose Lev makes both statements on Monday. - For **Statement 1** to hold: Lev lied on Sunday. - For **Statement 2** to hold: Lev must be lying on Monday, meaning he would tell the truth on Tuesday. This creates a contradiction because if he lied on Sunday, he should truthfully state that he lied yesterday (Monday), but this contradicts the requirement that he is lying today. - **Case 2**: Suppose Lev makes both statements on Tuesday. - For **Statement 1** to hold: Lev lied on Monday. - For **Statement 2** to hold: Lev must be lying on Tuesday, meaning he would tell the truth on Wednesday.

Considering the property of sine that ( left| sin frac{x_1 - x_2}{2} right| < frac{|x_1 - x_2|}{2} ), we get: [ left| x_1 - x_2 right| = 2 left| sin left( frac{x_1 - x_2}{2} right) right| left| cos left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) right| ] [ < left| x_1 - x_2 right| left| cos left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) right| ] 9. This inequality implies that: [ left| cos left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) right| > 1 ] 10. However, this result contradicts the fact that the cosine function has a range of ( -1 ) to ( 1 ): [ left| cos left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) right| leq 1 ] 11. Therefore, our assumption that there exist two distinct real roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) must be incorrect. Hence, the original equation ( x = sin x + 1993 ) can have at most one real root. 12.

Let ( a, b, c ) be the side lengths of triangle ( ABC ) and let ( p ) be its semiperimeter, i.e., ( p = frac{a+b+c}{2} ). 2. **Equilateral triangle case**: If ( P ) is the center of an equilateral triangle ( ABC ), then the distances from ( P ) to the vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are equal. Let this common distance be ( PA = PB = PC ). In an equilateral triangle, the distance from the center to any vertex is ( frac{2}{3} ) of the altitude. The altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length ( a ) is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a ). Therefore, ( PA = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}a ). 3. **Calculate the ratio**: For an equilateral triangle, ( p = frac{3a}{2} ). Thus, [ frac{PA}{p-a} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}a}{frac{3a}{2} - a} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}a}{frac{a}{2}} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}a}{frac{a}{2}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}. ] Similarly, ( frac{PB}{p-b} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} ) and ( frac{PC}{p-c} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} ). 4. **Assume a contradiction**: Assume there exists a point ( P ) in ( triangle ABC ) such that [ minleft(frac{PA}{p-a}, frac{PB}{p-b}, frac{PC}{p-c}right) > frac{2}{sqrt{3}}. ] 5. **Use Ptolemy's inequality**: Let ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) be the touchpoints of the incircle of ( triangle ABC ) with sides ( BC, CA, AB ) respectively.

She can produce exactly 26 different values using one or more of her coins. Determine the number of 10cent coins Claudia has. A) 9 B) 10 C) 11 D) 12 E) 13","completion":"1. **Define Variables:** Let ( x ) be the number of 5-cent coins, and ( y ) the number of 10-cent coins Claudia owns. Given she has 15 coins in total: [ x + y = 15 ] 2. **Express the Total Value Range:** The smallest possible value with Claudia's coins is 5 cents (using one 5-cent coin). The highest possible value is obtained using all her coins: [ 5x + 10y ] By substitution ( y = 15 - x ) into the total value: [ 5x + 10(15 - x) = 5x + 150 - 10x = 150 - 5x ] 3. **Calculate Number of Possible Values:** Claudia's possible values range from 5 cents to ( 150 - 5x ) cents, in 5-cent increments. The number of these values calculates to: [ frac{150 - 5x - 5}{5} + 1 = frac{145 - 5x}{5} + 1 = 29 - x ] We know 26 different values can be obtained. Thus: [ 29 - x = 26 ] Solving for ( x ): [ x = 3 ] 4. **Find the Number of 10-Cent Coins:** With ( x = 3 ), use ( x + y = 15 ): [ 3 + y = 15 implies y = 12 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Claudia has ( 12 ) 10-cent coins.
