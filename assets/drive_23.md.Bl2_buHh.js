The residents will be told that the drugs they are taking are to help protect them against potential radiation poisoning, but the true purpose of the drugs is far more sinister. In fact, not all residents will be getting the same chemical cocktail to begin with. The women of Vault 91 will be given an experimental growth treatment which will make them grow taller and stronger, maxing out at a bit over seven feet tall on average. Of course, this won’t make them lose any of their femininity: in fact, in some test subjects those same growth hormones may even increase the size of their hips, butt, and bust on top of everything else. However, these drugs also have the side effect of damaging certain areas of the brain dealing with critical thinking and memory retention, effectively making the female population of the Vault become dumber as they continue to grow. The men of Vault 91 will be given a series of drugs that will do pretty much the exact opposite. Their memory retention and critical thinking skills will increase during their treatment, increasing intelligence for them across the board, but these same drugs will also stunt their growth and make it harder to build and maintain muscle mass, eventually making the male population smarter but physically smaller and weaker than their female counterparts, with a final projected height of around four feet. The purpose of this experiment, at least in the eyes of Vault-Tec, would be twofold. The first would be to test the effectiveness of these drugs in general, and see if the potential benefits of each may outweigh their downsides. The second would be a sociological experiment to see which of the two genders would take control of the Vault once the drug treatments reach their final outcome. Will the stronger but dumber women use their physical strength to intimidate and strong-arm the men into serving their desires? Or will the weaker but smarter men convince the women of the Vault to let them do all of the thinking, and that it is in their best interest to follow any orders given to them by a man. Perhaps the two groups may even manage to find a balance that lets them maintain a surprisingly high level of gender equality despite the new size and intelligence gap between the two of them. In essence, Vault-Tec wants to figure out whether brains or brawn would win out if they were both pushed to an unnatural extreme. Unfortunately for Vault-Tec, things didn’t work as they expected,first of all the drugs didn’t seen to work at all on the residents of vault 91 outside a slightly increase headache on the women and muscle cramps on men, a fact that made vault-tec to almost scrap alway the vault until it was revealed that the drugs take effect on the next generation that are born and grow up in the Vault with the regiment would be changed, the effect are minimal and barely notice but they accumulate by each generation.another side effect is that the drugs increase female births and diminish male births, minimal at first but like the previous effect it accumulate that by the 200 years late there be 200 women for every man.also due to a unrelated failure on the jumpsuit synthesizers all jumpsuits produce in vault are made skimpy and shorter than other vaaults,like the prevously minimal at first but it accumulate that by the 200 years late the vault jumpsuit will be speedos for the men, and two piece bikinis for the women.

Vault-Tec's grand experiment had lasted over two centuries, and Simon, a direct descendant of the original inhabitants, was a living testament to the effects of the infamous drug regimen. Standing at three feet eleven inches, he was remarkably intelligent, a survivor in a world where physical strength had once ruled. Vault 91's corridors buzzed with activity, the walls reverberating with the sounds of high-pitched laughter and incessant chatter from its predominantly female population. Women, towering over seven feet tall, flashed smiles that were as wide as they were genuine. Their beauty was as undeniable as it was exaggerated, their curvaceous figures barely contained by the standard-issue vault bikinis. Simon, with his oversized lab coat obscuring his embarrassingly tiny speedo, navigated through the crowd of giddy women, each of whom seemed more than eager to offer affectionate caresses that left him blushing and awkwardly trying to hide spontaneous physical reactions. The women of Vault 91 were known for their hyper-energetic and affectionate demeanor, making the vault a strangely jubilant place despite its fraught origins. As the head researcher, Simon was well aware of the Vault's history. Each day, as he sat amongst the sprawling servers and old terminal screens, reading through the Vault-Tec logs, he'd piece together a clearer picture of what his ancestors underwent. It was a grim tale of manipulation and control, an unethical trial that would have been horrific had the results not been so peculiarly benign. The drug regimen had indeed transformed the successive generations. The women had grown to towering statues of femininity, and their hormones had spiked to levels that made them perpetually cheerful and irrepressibly affectionate. This posed a unique challenge to governance within Vault 91. Though the men were intellectually superior and therefore the qualified leaders, they were few and constantly overwhelmed by the sheer exuberance of their female counterparts. Today, Simon’s goal was to address the latest malfunctioning equipment in the water purification unit—a task that he speculated was tampered with by one of the more mischievous girls. But first, he needed to get past Ruby, a six-foot-ten mechanic whose brilliant smile was matched only by her delight in playingfully blocking his path. “Morning, Simon!” Ruby boomed, her full curls bouncing as she stepped closer, dwarfing him further. “Need a hand reaching the top shelf again?” Simon offered a small, resigned smile, trying to maintain focus on his clipboard. “No, thank you, Ruby. I have things under control.” It was a familiar dance. Simon represented something of a prize among the women of Vault 91. Not only was he the smartest among the men, but given the peculiar effects of the drugs, he was also a symbol of virility in a strange, Vault-Tec-engineered way. The Vault's dress code did little to help Simon's cause. The skimpy speedos, which now constituted the men’s uniform, were supposed to be practical given the warmer climate control settings preferred by the women. However, the exposure did nothing but amplify the awkwardness of each social encounter, especially for someone as easily flustered as Simon. Through careful sidestepping and a bit of polite insistence, Simon managed to navigate Ruby’s playful obstruction and made his way to the lower levels. The air grew cooler as he descended into the bowels of the Vault, where the mechanical heart pulsed and hummed with life. Few women ventured here, given the complexity of the systems and their own diminished critical thinking abilities. The water purifier was indeed an easy fix, the result of a loose valve likely mishandled by one of the women trying to be helpful. Simon's deft mental faculties had it back online in minutes. He might not have possessed the brawn to be the hero in an old-world sense, but in Vault 91, intellect had risen to the top. Simon emerged from the lower levels to find the vault in the midst of preparation for the evening's social gathering—a tradition that maintained morale. As he passed by, his presence incited playful wolf-whistles from the women dressed in their ornate bikini-esque jumpsuits, their ample figures glorified by the cut and fabric. It was meant to instill a sense of pride, but Simon found it humiliating. In the upstairs living quarters, everything shone with a polished cleanliness, attended to by the loving hands of many enthusiastic residents. The communal areas were open and vibrant, often hosting various activities that matched the childlike joyfulness of the women. Tonight, as Simon took a seat at the dining hall, for what would undoubtedly be a raucous gathering, he noticed the women glancing at him with those beaming smiles and twinkling eyes. They respected him, adored him even, not just for his capacity of thought, but for his uniqueness in their world. They depended on men like Simon to solve problems they no longer could understand with their nurtured idealism and reduced cognitive function, yet they adored the men with a sisterly protectiveness. The sight was heartwarming, but it left Simon deep in contemplation. Would the Vault ever return to pre-experiment equilibrium, or had Vault-Tec sculpted a new norm for their inhabitants? For now, the question remained unanswered, just another curious anomaly in the Fallout Universe, tucked away inside Vault 91. In Vault 91, the value systems of the old world had tumbled down. Here, despite the vast differences in physical and mental faculties, balance was maintained through a mutual reliance, a strangely harmonious coexistence crafted by Vault-Tec's sinister designs. Simon mulled over this as the celebrations erupted around him, the laughter ringing in his ears, wondering what place awaited Vault 91 in the history books of post-apocalyptic America."},{"prompt":"continue with a chapter of 1000 words where we follow a different male, one that was walking alone in the hallways a act with make him prime target for roaming groups of women in search of a lonely males to shower in affections. he encounter one of those groups.they insist that he pass the night with them as today is a \\"cold night\\"","completion":"In the shadow-drawn corridors of Vault 91, Jonah moved cautiously, aware that to be a lone male in the vast, estrogen-drenched labyrinth was to invite an unprecedented level of attention. While the spacious halls were a marvel of pre-war architecture, for Jonah, they often felt like gauntlets. Dressed in his tight-fitting speedo, which left little to the imagination, and a thin tank top that matched the Vault’s dress regulations, he resembled prey to the roving bands of enthusiastic women who saw in every man an opportunity to lavish their overwhelming affections. It was said that Vault 91 never truly experienced a cold night, with the climate control calibrated perfectly to suit the physical comfort of its towering female denizens. Tonight, however, an announcement had crackled over the PA system, warning of a slight malfunction that could result in a temperature drop. This \\"cold night\\" warning was all it took for the women to scour the vault for their beloved males, to ensure they were adequately comforted. Jonah had just turned a corner when he encountered them—a boisterous group of women, whose giggles echoed off the metal walls. Their eyes immediately lit up, sparkling in the fluorescent lights that lined the pathway, as they spotted Jonah trying to make a hasty retreat. \\"Oh look, it's Jonah!\\" one of the women exclaimed, her voice deep and sonorous, betraying the height she had achieved thanks to Vault-Tec's sinister hormonal cocktail. “You shouldn’t be alone on a cold night like this,” another chimed in, her hair cascading in chestnut waves over her broad shoulders. Jonah gave a slight nod, attempting to maintain a polite smile while internally devising an escape. \\"Actually, I was just—\\" \\"Headed to our quarters, I hope!\\" a third woman declared with a laugh that rumbled through the hall. Their clothes, similar to bikinis but with the Vault's number emblazoned on them, struggled to contain their generous curves. Having been conditioned for generations, it never occurred to them that their clothes, or lack thereof, could be seen as inappropriate or impractical. Cornered and outnumbered, Jonah realized resistance would be not only futile but potentially hurtful to the gentle giants that now loomed around him, their eager faces etched with concern and want. “Yes,” he conceded softly, “I wouldn’t want to catch a chill.” The group beamed in unison, their joy a palpable force that seemed to brighten the metallic vault surroundings. They closed in around Jonah, shepherding him with gentleness that belied their enormity. Their hands, warm and enveloping, occasionally brushed against his arms, sending involuntary shivers down his spine—not from the feared cold, but from the distinct sensation of being so utterly dwarfed and desired. The women, making a cordon of safety and affection, guided him away from the main hall and towards the residential wing, where the living quarters were tailored to the comfort of the towering amazons. Jonah realized this evening would be spent under the scrutiny of his enthusiastic captors, a harem of well-meaning giants who only understood a world where their care was a duty and a pleasure. Their quarters were expansive, with doorways arching high and furniture that looked like it had been borrowed from a giant’s abode. The room was warm and smelled faintly of the lavender cleaners used by the Vault's maintenance personnel. As they entered, a multitude of plush blankets and soft pillows came into view, all prepared for communal sleeping—a Vault 91 tradition on \\"cold nights.\\" Jonah's guardians were quick to ensure his comfort, offering him a spot in the middle of their nest-like arrangement so that he might be afforded the most warmth. More than once, he had to politely refuse the tempting offers of backrubs, shoulder massages and the likes—acts of caring that straddled the line between maternal and dangerously intimate. “We’ll keep you safe and warm, Jonah,” a woman named Helena promised, her hands patting the pillow beside her as she looked down at him with a mix of protectiveness and fondness. For his part, Jonah understood the bizarre new world order he had been born into. Despite the women’s overwhelming physical advantages, it was the men who held the keys to the vault’s technology, to the decision-making that kept their society running. The ladies held strength, and the affection they held for the males was rooted in genuine care, but it was laced with an aching dependence—a byproduct of Vault-Tec’s cruel ingenuity. As the night crept on and conversation faded into yawns, the group finally settled. The warmth was unyielding, as bodies intertwined in a tangled mass of limbs and soft fabric. For a moment, Jonah lay awake, feeling the rhythmic breathing of those around him, the occasional twitch or snore that bespoke deep slumber. It was in these quiet hours that Jonah allowed himself to question what it really meant to be cared for, to be treasured, when so much of it was manipulated by a long-absent corporation’s designs. He pondered the future of Vault 91 and what place they all might find in a world that had moved on without them. Eventually, exhaustion claimed him, and he joined the symphony of breaths and heartbeat in the cavernous warmth of the group embrace. The night would pass, the temperature would rise again, and life in Vault 91 would continue, a bizarre but harmonious ballet choreographed by Vault-Tec, danced by unwitting performers in the grand theater of their vault."},{"prompt":"Give structure of entire Earth 1.

Each blink seemed to last an eternity as the centerline of the highway blurred into a hypnotic ribbon. He hadn’t planned on driving cross-country alone, but his buddies had bailed last minute, and Gary was nothing if not committed to a road trip challenge. Yet, now, under the spell of moonlight and fatigue, he contemplated the allure of a respite. “Next exit, some Z’s and a bit of mindless TV,” he muttered to himself, coaxing his spirit with the prospect of rest. The faded billboard ahead, asserting “Dreamers' Haven - Rest Like Royalty,” beckoned Gary to abandon the endless asphalt. Minutes later, he was pulling into a parking lot that belonged to a place that seemed anything but kingly. Dreamers' Haven was more akin to a pauper's retreat, with flickering neon and a vibe that screamed ‘discount debauchery’ rather than luxury. Exhausted and not in a position to be choosy, Gary approached the office, the door chimes sounding a forlorn tune as he entered. Behind a plexiglass barrier sat Joe, a man whose demeanor suggested he had seen every walk of life and judged them all equally – harshly. Joe’s eyes squinted in suspicion as Gary approached. “I need a room, nothing fancy. Just a shower and a bed,” Gary yawned. Joe’s lips curled into a smirk as he handed over a key with a dangling, cracked plastic tag marked 237. “One problem, buddy, we run a tight ship. No funny business or you’re out on your keister, got it?” Gary blinked, unsure of the proprietor's insinuations but too tired to care. “Got it.” He slowly traipsed up the stairs to the second floor, counting door numbers until he found his temporary sanctuary. The room looked like a set from a B-movie; think brothel-chic meets thrift store disaster. Without further adieu, Gary stripped down to his birthday suit and stepped into the shower, letting the water pressure beat against his muscles like a novice masseuse. The shower was a symphony of clanking pipes and erratic temperature, but it was a welcomed embrace to Gary’s aching body. Steam swirled around him as he closed his eyes, embracing the brief reprieve from the day’s weariness. Clean and even more fatigued, if that were possible, Gary turned off the water and stepped out onto the grimy tile floor. Just as he reached for the towel, the room door swung open with a creak that could only precede trouble. In the doorway stood a shrill vision—Mabel, the infamous surprise maid of Dreamers' Haven. Her agape mouth and startled scream shattered Gary’s serene, post-shower buzz. “I thought room service was later!” Gary yelped, inadvertently flinging his towel into the corner. Mabel, recovering from the shock, screeched for assistance before stumbling backward and fleeing the scene. Gary, in pure panic and naked as a jaybird, surged into action. He leapt for the now-close door – unaware of the key sticking out and inadvertently locking himself out. But horror upon horror, Gary had not only left his room – he had taken the completely wrong exit, out onto the balcony. There, in a farcical series of missteps, he toppled over the railing and found himself dangling perilously from the second-floor ledge, just above a dark, deserted alleyway. A gust of wind brought goosebumps to his vulnerable flesh while his fingers clung to the chipping paint of the motel’s facade. “This is not how I envisioned my evening!” Gary exclaimed, his voice echoing off the walls. Meanwhile, down in the empty parking lot, Joe was browsing Gary’s car for valuables, shaking his head. “Told him no funny business,” he grumbled, snagging Gary’s wallet, clothes, and keys. As Joe appraised the disheveled man’s possessions, he figured he could make a quick buck or two at the pawn shop the following day. He patted the pockets of Gary’s jeans, finding the car key, and decided he’d add grand theft auto to his resume by tearing out the car parts for sale. Back on the precarious ledge, Gary’s knuckles were turning white. Suddenly, Mabel reappeared at the balcony door, armed with hysterical flailing and zero helpfulness. She exclaimed, “Get back in your room, you nasty streaker, or you’re outta here!” “Out?” Gary’s voice cracked, as the absurdity of the situation dawned upon him. He could almost laugh at his own predicament. “Yeah, you heard me! OUT!” With that directive, the last of Gary’s strength waned. But as he braced for the inevitable plunge, a stroke of luck—or perhaps just the structural neglect of Dreamers' Haven—intervened. The wooden panel under his feet creaked and gave way, creating a small platform for him to plant his feet. Gary was now precariously perched but no longer dangling. From below, Joe noticed the commotion and realized that the motel’s reputation could use one less naked-midair calamity. He approached the scene, waving Gary’s clothes like a truce flag. However, Gary, still aloft and certainly not amused, saw through Joe’s sudden gesture of goodwill. For what felt like an eternity, Gary remained perched above the alley. With every passing second, he swore he could feel his dignity being swept away by the indifferent breeze. The Dreamers' Haven was no haven after all, but a theater set for the cosmic comedy of Gary’s life. At this very ledge, he made a mental note to himself – next time, no matter how tired, drive the extra mile for a chain hotel."},{"prompt":"Make up some new D&D 5e spells for a homebrew sub-transfiguration school of magic, called Glutomancy; in which a cast's can expand her own or a host's backside. It will eventually resize itself unless the casting is repeated. The achievement of this spell has been kept secret. Kept only in old grimoires by groups to gain an advantage over others, it has a steep learning curve to get the slightest results. Since its earliest uses, it's been used in ceremonies, public events, entertainment, and special occasions... and the occasional face-sitting. Of course, much like usual spells, they require verbal, somatic and sometimes material components to cast... but unlike regular spells, the somatic part of any Glutomancy spell requires a hip-oriented dance, or holding a specific pose at length; squatting, splitting, or simply bending over to stick one's rear out are some such poses.","completion":"Please note that the concept of Glutomancy, as described, is something of a humorous or bizarre-style addition to the typical high-fantasy D&D setting and may not be suitable for all gaming groups. It's important to discuss with your players what kinds of content they are comfortable with in your game, ensuring that everyone at the table is having a good time. Here are three spells for the Glutomancy sub-school of transfiguration: 1. **Amplify Derrière** *1st Level Transmutation (Glutomancy)* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** Touch - **Components:** V, S (hip swivels), M (a peach feather) - **Duration:** 1 hour - **Classes:** Wizard, Bard When you cast this spell, you touch one willing creature, causing their backside to enlarge noticeably, though clothes are unaffected and may become uncomfortable or ill-fitting. This might be used to impress onlookers, intimidate others by taking more space, or provide cushioning for sitting on hard surfaces. For the duration, the target gains a +1 bonus to Charisma checks but has their speed reduced by 5 feet due to the unfamiliar weight distribution. Athletic or acrobatic activities that rely on balance may suffer a -1 penalty to rolls. 2. **Bountiful Bustle** *3rd Level Transmutation (Glutomancy)* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** 30 feet - **Components:** V, S (a prolonged squat) - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes - **Classes:** Wizard, Bard You cause the backside of up to three creatures within range that you can see to expand dramatically. The target(s) may make a Constitution saving throw to resist the spell. On a failed save, creatures not only find their mobility hindered, reducing their speed by half, but also grant advantage on all overrunning attempts against them due to altered balance. Targets affected by this spell offer soft cover to creatures directly behind them and can use their additional girth to perform special shoving actions, either to knock enemies prone or push them away without requiring an athletics check. 3. **Gluteus Maximus** *5th Level Transmutation (Glutomancy)* - **Casting Time:** 1 minute - **Range:** Touch - **Components:** V, S (a series of elaborate dance moves), M (a silk pillow filled with goose down, which the spell consumes) - **Duration:** 8 hours - **Classes:** Wizard, Bard This powerful Glutomancy spell targets one willing creature and magnifies their backside to tremendous size. The sheer volume grants the target advantages in social encounters, adding a +3 bonus to Charisma (Performance) and Persuasion checks when appearance and stage presence are beneficial. Additionally, when sitting, the target can utilize their enhanced posterior to use the \\"Squashing Maneuver\\" once per short rest, knocking an adjacent creature prone unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw. However, due to the proportions, moving becomes awkward. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, they have disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and they cannot benefit from effects that would increase their speed, as they must take care not to fall over. After these spells end, the affected creature's backside returns to its original size over the course of 1d4 minutes, which can cause some discomfort or embarrassment.

For example, the vast majority of skilled Glutomancers are permanently augmented as a result of the frequent use of such spells, and utilize unique \\"cheek gestures\\", using their rears to bounce, wiggle, wave and clap their cheeks. These simple, effortless gestures are used to greet someone, to emphasize something or get someone's attention. In fact, it's almost ubiquitous to hear a soft \\"clap clap\\" when in the presence of any large Glutomancer.","completion":"In the fantasy world of your creation, Glutomancy might not be a commonly practiced form of magic but would have a rich history and unusual place in society. Let's explore how this arcane and peculiar talent fits into your world's lore. **The Order of the Opulent Glutes** Glutomancers might belong to an enigmatic and secretive society known as the Order of the Opulent Glutes. Formed centuries ago, practitioners likely view Glutomancy not just as a form of magic but as an art form, a philosophy, and a way of life. Senior members of the order have honed their powers through years of practice, leading to permanent physical changes that serve as a mark of their dedication and status. **Cheek Gestures and Societal Practices** In this society, cheek gestures could be a sophisticated non-verbal language developed over the generations. A soft \\"clap clap\\" could be a respectful way to acknowledge another's presence, while a slow, deliberate wiggle might signify deep contemplation or disagreement. Rapid bounces might be a way to express urgency or excitement. Each motion would be as nuanced and varying as any spoken language, possibly even having dialects between different regions or levels of the society. **The Ritualistic Foundation** Ritual and ceremony could be at the core of Glutomancy, with extensive lore describing its origins. Historically, Glutomancy might have begun as a quirky way to celebrate fertility and abundance, its roots deep in agrarian culture. Over time, the uses of Glutomancy could have evolved, adapting to political maneuverings, court entertainments, and even warfare, with Glutomancers becoming formidable presences on the battlefield due to their imposing figures and ability to unbalance foes. **Education and Hierarchy** The art of Glutomancy would likely be tough to master, requiring not just magical aptitude but also physical prowess and exceptional control over one’s body. Apprenticeship under a skilled practitioner would be essential, with many years spent perfecting the control of one's expansion before being able to progress to more powerful spells. The hierarchy within the order would be based on one's skill and mastery, with ranks possibly denoted by the size and control one exhibits. **Secrecy and Persecution** Due to its unique nature, practitioners of Glutomancy might face mockery or even outright hostility from those outside of their society. This prejudice would prompt the Order of the Opulent Glutes to practice in secret, hiding their \\"blessings\\" using magical or mundane means when among the uninitiated. The order's secrecy would be paramount, not only to keep their art pure from dabblers but also to protect its members from a world that may not understand or accept their gift. **Integration with Greater Society** In some societies, public displays of Glutomancy could be an essential part of festivals or public ceremonies, perhaps having Glutomancers act as figures of good fortune and bounty. Skilled Glutomancers might enjoy celebrity status in these cultures and be called upon to entertain, advise, or even lead.

Das Spiel wurde als Early-Access-Titel veröffentlicht und hat sich bei Spielern, die sich für Weltraumerkundung, Survival und Terraforming interessieren, großer Beliebtheit erfreut. Hier sind einige Kernelemente, die \\"Planetcrafter\\" ausmachen: 1. **Terraforming**: Der zentrale Aspekt des Spiels ist das Terraforming, also die Veränderung und Bearbeitung eines Planeten, um ihn bewohnbar zu machen. Spieler sammeln Ressourcen, errichten Strukturen und Maschinen, um die Umweltbedingungen zu verändern – mit dem Ziel, eine Atmosphäre zu schaffen, die Tier- und Pflanzenleben unterstützt. 2. **Überlebensmechaniken**: Spieler müssen in einer feindlichen Umgebung überleben, was bedeutet, dass sie auf Sauerstoff, Temperatur und andere lebenserhaltende Faktoren achten müssen. Ressourcenmanagement und Vorratsplanung sind entscheidend für das Fortbestehen. 3. **Erkundung**: Das Spiel bietet eine offene Welt, die erkundet werden kann und in der die Spieler vielfältige Biome, Ressourcen und manchmal auch Geheimnisse oder Relikte einer alten Zivilisation finden können. 4. **Basisbau**: Ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Spiels ist der Ausbau der eigenen Basis. Die Erstellung von Habitaten und anderen nützlichen Strukturen ist essentiell für das Vorankommen im Spiel. 5. **Wissenschaft und Forschung**: Im Spielverlauf schalten Spieler neue Technologien und Gebäude frei, die für den Terraforming-Prozess unerlässlich sind. Durch Forschung und Experimente können sie die Effizienz ihrer Ausrüstung verbessern. 6. **Einfacher Grafikstil**: Das Spiel verfügt über einen verhältnismäßig einfachen, aber ansprechenden Grafikstil, der es ermöglicht, sich auf das Gameplay zu konzentrieren, ohne von den technischen Aspekten abgelenkt zu werden. 7. **Solo-Erfahrung**: Planetcrafter ist vorrangig als Singleplayer-Spiel konzipiert, was den Fokus auf eine individuelle Erforschungs- und Aufbaugeschichte legt. 8. **Community und Feedback**: Da es sich um ein Early-Access-Spiel handelt, ist das Feedback der Community essentiell für die Entwicklung und das Balancing des Spiels. Die Entwickler nehmen Rückmeldungen der Spieler ernst und arbeiten kontinuierlich daran, das Spiel zu erweitern und zu verbessern. Das Spiel setzt auf Kreativität und langfristige Zielsetzung, wodurch sich Spieler in das Projekt, einen leblosen Planeten in eine blühende Oase zu verwandeln, vertiefen können. Der sanfte Einstieg und die allmähliche Steigerung der Komplexität erlauben sowohl Neulingen als auch erfahrenen Spielern, Fortschritte zu genießen und ihre eigenen Spielstile zu erkunden."},{"prompt":"Meinst du man könnte ein Spiel ähnlich zu planetcrafter als MMO machen?","completion":"Ja, ein Spiel mit einem ähnlichen Konzept wie \\"Planetcrafter\\" ließe sich theoretisch in ein MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online Game) umwandeln. Die Kernidee des Terraformings und der Planetengestaltung in einem gemeinschaftlichen Kontext könnte definitiv ein fesselndes und einzigartiges MMO-Erlebnis schaffen. Hier sind einige Überlegungen und Herausforderungen, die bei der Entwicklung eines solchen Spiels berücksichtigt werden müssten: 1. **Gemeinschaftliche Terraforming-Projekte**: Spieler könnten in großen Gruppen zusammenarbeiten, um die Umweltbedingungen eines ganzen Planeten oder von Planetenteilen gemeinsam zu verändern. Jede Spielergruppe könnte für verschiedene Aspekte des Terraformings verantwortlich sein. 2. **Ressourcenmanagement und Wirtschaft**: In einem MMO könnten die Spieler in ein komplexes Wirtschaftssystem eingebunden werden, in dem Handel und Ressourcenmanagement eine Schlüsselrolle spielen. 3. **Landbesitz und Governance**: Spieler oder Gilden könnten bestimmte Landstriche oder Planetenbereiche besitzen und verwalten. Es könnten komplexe Governance-Strukturen entstehen, in denen Spieler Entscheidungen über die Entwicklung ihres Territoriums treffen müssen. 4. **PvP- und PvE-Elemente**: In Bezug auf das Spieler-gegen-Spieler (PvP) und Spieler-gegen-Umwelt (PvE) Gameplay könnten Konflikte um Ressourcen, Territorien oder die Ausrichtung des Terraforming-Projekts entstehen. 5. **Technologie- und Forschungssystem**: Eine gemeinschaftlich vorangetriebene Forschung könnte Spielern ermöglichen, neue Technologien freizuschalten, die das Terraforming beschleunigen oder das Überleben verbessern. 6. **Eventgesteuerte Inhalte**: Regelmäßige Events und Herausforderungen könnten Spieler dazu anregen, zusammenzuarbeiten oder zu konkurrieren, um besondere Belohnungen oder Fortschritte im Terraforming zu erzielen. 7. **Nachhaltige Umgebung**: Die Umgebung eines MMO sollte dynamisch und nachhaltig gestaltet sein, um kontinuierliche Interaktionen und Veränderungen durch eine große Spielerbasis zu ermöglichen. 8. **Server- und Technikherausforderungen**: Technisch gesehen wäre es eine Herausforderung, Hunderte oder gar Tausende von Spielern gleichzeitig auf einem sich kontinuierlich verändernden Planeten zu unterstützen. 9. **Spielerbeeinflussung und Story**: Eine gemeinsame Geschichte, die durch die Aktionen der Spielerschaft vorangetrieben wird, könnte eine tiefe Verbindung zur Spielwelt und zu anderen Spielern schaffen. 10. **Soziale Strukturen und Konfliktlösung**: Konflikte und Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Spielern oder Fraktionen könnten ein integrierter Bestandteil des Spiels sein, wobei Mechanismen zur Konfliktlösung notwendig wären. Die Konzipierung eines MMOs nach dem Vorbild von Planetcrafter würde allerdings auch eine gut durchdachte Balancierung und Skalierung erfordern, um sicherzustellen, dass sowohl einzelne Spieler als auch große Gruppen wichtige und zufriedenstellende Rollen in der Spielwelt einnehmen können."},{"prompt":"Um gespeicherte daten zu minimieren wäre eine idee von mir das die Bassis der Spieler mobil ist und nicht persistent auf der welt.

Hier sind einige Vor- und Nachteile sowie zusätzliche Ideen, um die gespeicherten Daten zu minimieren: Vorteile dieser Idee: - **Serverlast Reduzierung**: Indem nur aktive Basen geladen werden, kann die Serverlast durch inaktive Spielerstrukturen verringert werden. - **Dynamische Welt**: Die Spielwelt bleibt dynamisch und verändert sich regelmäßig, wenn Spieler ein- und ausloggen, was zu einem einzigartigen Erlebnis bei jedem Login führen kann. - **Weniger Griefing**: Es wird vermieden, dass inaktive Basen von anderen Spielern zerstört oder geplündert werden, wenn der Besitzer nicht online ist. Nachteile dieser Idee: - **Handelsbeschränkungen**: Handel und Interaktionen zwischen Spielern könnten beeinträchtigt werden, wenn Basen nicht dauerhaft sind. - **Community Building**: Es erschwert den Aufbau von Gemeinschaften und den sozialen Zusammenhalt, da dauerhafte Nachbarschaften schwerer zu formen sind. Alternative Vorschläge könnten sein: 1. **Instanzierte Basen**: Spieler könnten ihre Basen in Instanzen bauen, was bedeutet, dass jede Basis in einem eigenen Teil des Servers existiert und nur dann geladen wird, wenn der Spieler oder Besucher sie betritt. 2. **Limitierte Bauzonen**: Um die Anzahl der Strukturen zu begrenzen, könnten nur bestimmte Bereiche für den Bbau von Basen freigegeben werden, ähnlich wie bei Parzellen in einem Wohngebiet. 3. **Basen-Rücksetzungsmechaniken**: Es könnten Mechaniken eingeführt werden, welche die Basen inaktiver Spieler nach einer bestimmten Zeit der Inaktivität automatisch entfernen oder zurücksetzen. 4. **Server-Wipe-Intervalle**: Legen Sie regelmäßige Wipe-Intervalle fest, bei denen die Spielwelt periodisch zurückgesetzt wird, ähnlich wie bei Spielen wie \\"Rust\\". 5. **Dekonstruktions-Mechanismen**: Spieler könnten dazu ermutigt werden, ihre Basen aktiv zu dekonstruieren, bevor sie längere Zeit offline gehen, vielleicht im Austausch für Ressourcen oder andere Vorteile. 6. **Cluster-Server-Technologie**: Teilen der Spielwelt auf verschiedene Server (Cluster), auf denen jeweils nur ein Teil der Spieler agiert, und die Datenlast so verteilt wird. 7. **Limitierte Bauwerke pro Spieler/Gilde**: Eine Begrenzung der Anzahl und Größe von Strukturen, die ein einzelner Spieler oder eine Gilde errichten kann. Bei all diesen Ansätzen ist es wichtig, das Spielerlebnis im Auge zu behalten und sicherzustellen, dass technische Einschränkungen nicht zu Lasten des Spielspaßes gehen.

Diese Videos visualisieren komplexe wissenschaftliche Konzepte wie natürliche Selektion, Evolution und das Überleben der am besten angepassten Organismen auf eine Weise, die für ein breites Publikum zugänglich ist. Die Idee, ein Videospiel zu entwickeln, das auf dem Konzept der natürlichen Selektionssimulation basiert, wobei Evolution und Attribute von Kreaturen in einer Art Roguelike-Spiel gewählt werden, ist sehr interessant. Solch ein Ansatz könnte das Strategiespiel mit echten biologischen Prinzipien verbinden und ein faszinierendes, lehrreiches sowie unterhaltsames Spielerlebnis bieten. Hier sind einige Gedanken dazu: 1. **Prozedurale Generation**: Roguelike-Spiele zeichnen sich durch ihre prozedural generierten Ebenen und Umgebungen aus, was auch für die Erzeugung von variablen Bedingungen für Evolutionssimulationen genutzt werden könnte. Jedes Spiel würde eine neue Reihe von Umweltbedingungen schaffen, die verschiedene evolutionäre Pfade begünstigen. 2. **Mutation und Anpassung**: Spieler könnten direkt die Mutationen und Anpassungen ihrer Kreaturen auswählen, die dann Auswirkungen auf ihr Überleben haben. Diese könnten zufällige Elemente kombiniert mit einer Auswahl von Attributen beinhalten, ähnlich den Gegenständen oder Fähigkeiten, die man in anderen Roguelike-Spielen wählt. 3. **Überlebensherausforderungen**: Das Spiel könnte verschiedene Herausforderungen in jeder \\"Runde\\" präsentieren, die den natürlichen Selektionsprozess beeinflussen. Spieler müssten Entscheidungen treffen, um ihre Kreaturen an Räuber, Klimaveränderungen, Nahrungsmangel oder Krankheiten anzupassen. 4. **Evolutionäre Pfade**: Spieler könnten verschiedene evolutionäre Pfade verfolgen, die sich auf verschiedene Überlebensstrategien wie Geschwindigkeit, Stärke, Kooperation oder Tarnung konzentrieren. 5. **Langzeit-Entwicklung**: Wie in vielen Roguelikes könnte der Spieler von Spiel zu Spiel Wissen und Ressourcen anhäufen, die die evolutionären Optionen für zukünftige Versuche beeinflussen. 6. **Pädagogischer Wert**: Das Spiel könnte auch als Bildungswerkzeug fungieren, das Prinzipien der Evolutionstheorie in einem interaktiven und greifbaren Format vermittelt. 7. **Community-Involvement**: Ein auf der Community basierendes Element, bei dem Spieler ihre erfolgreichsten Kreaturen teilen oder in einer Art Wettbewerb gegeneinander antreten könnten, würde einen sozialen Aspekt schaffen und die Investition in das Überlebensschicksal der Kreaturen erhöhen. Ein Spiel mit diesen Elementen könnte sowohl Hardcore-Spieler als auch Casual-Gamer ansprechen, die an der Schnittstelle von Spielmechanik und Lernen interessiert sind.

Radius, composition (pie chart based on chemistry and percentage), density of internal layers. Including planet Earth. Including calculation example, mass is kg and Earth mass.","completion":"To calculate the empirical mass of a planet with internal structure, we can use the formula: Mass = ∫∫∫ ρ(r) dV where ρ(r) is the density at a certain radius r and dV is the volume element. We can divide the planet into different layers based on composition and density to simplify the calculation. Let's take Earth as an example: 1. Earth's radius is approximately 6,371 km. 2. Earth's composition can be broken down into three main layers: - Crust (continental and oceanic): 0-100 km, average density of 2.7 g/cm^3 - Mantle: 100-2,900 km, average density of 3.3 g/cm^3 - Core (inner and outer): 2,900-6,371 km, average density of 9.9 g/cm^3 To calculate the mass of each layer, we can use the formula mentioned above: - Crust: Volume = 4/3 * π * (100 km)^3 Mass = Density * Volume Mass = 2.7 g/cm^3 * Volume Mass = 2.7 g/cm^3 * 4/3 * π * (100 km)^3 - Mantle: Volume = 4/3 * π * ((2,900 km)^3 - (100 km)^3) Mass = Density * Volume Mass = 3.3 g/cm^3 * Volume Mass = 3.3 g/cm^3 * 4/3 * π * ((2,900 km)^3 - (100 km)^3) - Core: Volume = 4/3 * π * ((6,371 km)^3 - (2,900 km)^3) Mass = Density * Volume Mass = 9.9 g/cm^3 * Volume Mass = 9.9 g/cm^3 * 4/3 * π * ((6,371 km)^3 - (2,900 km)^3) Finally, we can sum up the masses of each layer to get the total mass of Earth. To convert the mass into kilograms, we can use the fact that 1 g = 0.001 kg, so the final mass will be in kilograms. For Earth, the total mass works out to be approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kg or 1 Earth mass. It is important to note that this is a simplified model and the actual mass of planets may vary due to factors like temperature, pressure, and composition variations within layers."},{"prompt":"okay look up m3 series kaggle competition I think it has 3,003 series and 504 have 20 or fewer observations, how did the winner fit the series witha few data points to forecast?","completion":"The M3 competition is actually a well-known forecasting competition that took place in the late 1990s, and while I can't access real-time, updated databases such as Kaggle to retrieve the information after my last update in early 2023, I can provide some information based on historical knowledge. The M3 Competition (Makridakis Competition) was the third in a series of competitions designed to evaluate and compare various forecasting methodologies. It included 3,003 time series from various domains and required participants to forecast future data points. As you mentioned, some of these series had fewer observations, which can be challenging because limited data points make it difficult to establish reliable patterns and trends. In forecasting competitions like the M3, when dealing with series with a small number of observations, the winners and other participants often use a combination of methods that can include: 1. **Simple Models**: Methods such as simple exponential smoothing or moving averages can sometimes perform surprisingly well, especially in the context of a competition where complex models might overfit the sparse data. 2. **Domain Expertise**: Understanding the context of the data series can guide the selection of the appropriate model or the adjustment of model parameters. 3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining forecasts from multiple models can help improve accuracy, as it reduces the risk associated with picking a single poor model for the series. 4. **Bootstrap or Resampling Techniques**: These can be used to artificially increase the number of observations by resampling the existing data points with replacement. 5. **Extrapolation**: In cases where patterns are hard to discern, straight-line extrapolation or using the last observed value can be a fallback strategy. 6. **Meta-learning**: Using historical performance of various models on similar time series to select the best model or combination of models for a new time series with few data points. 7. **Model Simplification**: Reducing the complexity of the model to match the simplicity of the data series - for instance, avoiding over-parameterization which could lead to overfitting. For the winner of the M3 competition, specific techniques applied to series with fewer data points would be detailed in the competition's final report or in subsequent academic papers analyzing the approaches. You might be able to access these reports or papers from libraries, academic institutions, or directly online to understand the winners' exact methods and modeling techniques. Remember that while these strategies can be effective, forecasting for time series with very few data points often involves a higher level of uncertainty, and forecast accuracy can be limited by the inherent lack of information in the data."},{"prompt":"How do I combine these import statements into one import RestoreIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Restore'; import FavoriteIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Favorite'; import LocationOnIcon from '@mui/icons-material/LocationOn';","completion":"You can combine these import statements into a single line by using named imports from the same module.

It will eventually resize itself unless the casting is repeated. The achievement of this spell has been kept secret. Kept only in old grimoires by groups to gain an advantage over others, it has a steep learning curve to get the slightest results. Since its earliest uses, it's been used in ceremonies, public events, entertainment, and special occasions... and the occasional face-sitting. Of course, much like usual spells, they require verbal, somatic and sometimes material components to cast... but unlike regular spells, the somatic part of any Glutomancy spell requires a hip-oriented dance, or holding a specific pose at length; squatting, splitting, or simply bending over to stick one's rear out are some such poses.","completion":"Here are some homebrew spells for the sub-transfiguration school of Glutomancy within the framework of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. Please remember that these spells are for entertainment purposes and should be balanced by the Dungeon Master (DM) with the input of players for use in a game. Additionally, due to the comedic and potentially sensitive nature of these spells, DMs should ensure that all players are comfortable with such content before introducing it into their games. # 1. Glutomancer's Embellishment *1st-level Glutomancy (transmutation)* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S (a rhythmic gyration of the hips) **Duration:** 1 hour You touch a willing creature and cause their backside to inflate slightly, enhancing its shape. For the duration, the creature gains a +2 bonus to Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to impress or distract an audience with physical movements. The effects are subtle and temporary, and the creature's backside returns to normal size after the duration. # 2. Cheeky Enlargement *2nd-level Glutomancy (transmutation)* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S (a deep squat held for a moment) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You cause the backside of a creature within range that you can see to increase to an unnaturally large size. The target creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet, but it gains advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against creatures that can see it. On a success, the spell has no effect. # 3. Derrière Deflation *3rd-level Glutomancy (transmutation)* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S (a quick ‘twerking’ motion) **Duration:** Instantaneous Select a creature within range. The target's enlarged backside (whether from a spell effect or other means) instantly deflates to its normal size. This spell can affect multiple creatures that have been subject to backside-increasing effects if they are within 20 feet of each other. # 4. Grandiose Glutes *4th-level Glutomancy (transmutation)* **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S (an intricate hip dance lasting the duration of the casting time) **Duration:** 8 hours Your backside swells to an enormous size, granting you a powerful presence. This grants you advantage on all Charisma checks for the duration and deals an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage on any successful shove or overrun action you make. However, you require double the amount of space to move through narrow passages, and squeezing through such areas is not possible. # 5. Pinnacle of Posteriors *6th-level Glutomancy (transmutation)* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S (holding an exaggerated bend-over pose for the spell's duration), M (a cushion or soft material, consumed by the spell) **Duration:** 24 hours You touch a willing creature and transfigure its backside to a legendary size and proportion. For the duration, the target gains a +3 bonus to their AC due to the increased difficulty for opponents to reach vital areas, and they gain resistance to falls from great heights as the transformed backside provides cushioning. Additionally, any creature attempting to grapple or shove the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone by the overwhelming mass. The spells above are intended to add a humorous and light-hearted aspect to a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. As always, the Dungeon Master should adapt these spells to fit the tone and balance of their game, and it should be agreed upon by all players to use such content to ensure everyone's enjoyment of the game."},{"prompt":"Seismic waves short notes","completion":"Seismic waves are forms of energy waves that are generated by earthquakes, explosions, or volcanic eruptions. These waves travel through the Earth's interior and across its surface. Here are short notes on the key points regarding seismic waves: - **Types of Seismic Waves:** There are two main types of seismic waves, body waves and surface waves. Body waves travel through the Earth's interior, and surface waves travel along the Earth's surface. - **Body Waves:** These are further classified into Primary (P) waves and Secondary (S) waves. - **P-waves (Primary waves):** Also known as compressional waves, these are the fastest seismic waves and can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. P-waves compress and expand the material in the direction they are traveling. - **S-waves (Secondary waves):** These waves are slower than P-waves and can only travel through solids. S-waves cause the material they pass through to shear or shake perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. - **Surface Waves:** These waves travel along the Earth's surface and tend to have larger amplitudes and longer wavelengths compared to body waves, often causing the most damage during an earthquake. There are two main types of surface waves: - **Love waves:** These cause horizontal shearing of the ground. - **Rayleigh waves:** These cause rolling motions, similar to ocean waves. - **Propagation:** The speed and path of seismic waves vary based on the density and elasticity of the material they travel through. Seismic waves tend to travel faster in denser and more elastic materials. - **Detection and Measurement:** Seismic waves are detected using instruments called seismometers or seismographs. By analyzing the data from these instruments, seismologists can determine the location, depth, and magnitude of an earthquake. - **Earth's Interior Information:** Seismic waves are also crucial for studying the Earth's interior structure. As they travel through the Earth, the waves are reflected, refracted, and absorbed by different layers within the Earth, providing insights into the properties and boundaries of these layers. - **Use in Exploration:** Seismic waves are not only relevant to natural events; they're also used in resource exploration, such as oil and gas prospecting. Controlled explosions or specialized equipment create artificial seismic waves that help map subsurface formations. Understanding seismic waves is essential for earthquake engineering, predicting the impact of earthquakes, and for the exploration of Earth's subsurface resources."},{"prompt":"Is it possible to install new Android version if the phone's manufacturer stopped updating? Can I do it with root access?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to install a new version of Android on a phone even if the manufacturer has stopped providing official updates, but this process generally requires advanced technical knowledge and can carry risks. Root access alone isn't enough; you typically need to unlock the bootloader and then flash a custom ROM that is compatible with your device. Here are the general steps involved in updating an Android phone to a newer version using a custom ROM: 1. **Unlock the bootloader**: This is a prerequisite for installing custom ROMs, but it can void your warranty and carries the risk of bricking your device if not done correctly. Procedures for unlocking the bootloader differ by manufacturer and model. 2. **Root access (optional)**: Depending on the ROM and the method you use, you may need to root your device. However, some custom ROMs can be installed without needing root access. 3. **Install a custom recovery**: To flash the custom ROM, you'll need a custom recovery environment, like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). This replaces the default recovery environment and gives you the tools to install custom software. 4. **Find a compatible custom ROM**: You have to choose a ROM that is made specifically for your device's model. Websites like XDA Developers are excellent resources for finding available ROMs and instructions specific to your device. Popular custom ROMs include LineageOS, Pixel Experience, and Paranoid Android among others. 5. **Backup your data**: Before proceeding, ensure that you back up all your important data, as the process will typically wipe your phone. 6. **Flash the custom ROM**: Follow the instructions provided by the ROM developer to flash the ROM to your device using the custom recovery. This will typically involve transferring the ROM file to your device's storage, booting into recovery mode, and then using the custom recovery's interface to install the ROM. 7. **Flash additional packages (if needed)**: Some ROMs may require you to flash additional packages like Google Apps (GApps), which aren't always included due to licensing restrictions. 8. **Initial setup**: Once everything has been installed, you'll need to go through the setup process, just like you would on a new phone. Note that the specific process can vary greatly depending on the phone model and the custom ROM you're trying to install, and not all devices will have custom ROMs available. Additionally, flashing a custom ROM can introduce stability and security issues. Thus, it's important to research thoroughly and ensure that you understand all the steps and risks involved. Also, remember that using a custom ROM might mean that you won't get automatic updates as you did with the stock ROM, so you will have to manually install updates to the custom ROM when they become available."},{"prompt":"Can I get the ROM from Android official website?","completion":"No, you cannot get custom ROMs from the official Android website. The official Android website provides source code for the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is the base version of the Android operating system. Custom ROMs are usually developed by third-party developers or communities who modify the AOSP to add features, improve performance, or update devices no longer supported by manufacturers. To obtain a custom ROM, you would typically visit community-driven websites or forums where developers share their work. Some of the most popular sites to find custom ROMs are: - **XDA Developers**: This is one of the largest and most well-known communities for Android development. You can find ROMs, mods, and detailed installation guides for a wide variety of devices. - **LineageOS**: LineageOS is a popular custom ROM that continues the legacy of the former CyanogenMod. They provide their own ROMs for many devices, with a focus on stability and privacy. - **Other custom ROM projects**: Projects like Paranoid Android, Pixel Experience, Resurrection Remix, and more all have their own websites and communities where they distribute their ROMs and provide installation instructions. Always ensure that you download ROMs from reputable sources to avoid the risks of malware and other security issues. Additionally, follow the instructions provided by ROM developers or experienced community members to minimize the risk of damaging your device during the flashing process."},{"prompt":"Is it hard to compile AOSP myself?","completion":"Compiling the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) from source can be challenging, especially if you're not familiar with the process or the tools involved. It requires a good understanding of Linux/Unix environments, knowledge of command-line operations, and in some cases, programming knowledge, particularly in Java and C/C++. Here's a high-level overview of what the AOSP build process generally entails: 1. **System Requirements**: You need a computer with Linux or macOS. AOSP is traditionally built on a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu. The system should have the necessary hardware requirements, including at least 16GB of RAM (though 32GB or more is recommended), a multi-core processor, and plenty of disk space (over 250GB of SSD space is a good starting point). 2. **Dependencies**: There are specific tools and packages you need to compile AOSP, such as Java Development Kit (JDK), GNU Make, and other build essentials. Google provides a list of required packages for Ubuntu. 3. **Downloading the Source**: Downloading the AOSP source code involves using the \\"repo\\" tool and Git. The AOSP repository is large (over 100GB), and downloading it can take a significant amount of time. 4. **Installing the Build Environment**: You need to set up and configure your build environment according to the instructions provided by AOSP. This might include setting environment variables and configuring other system settings. 5. **Preparing to Build**: Before building, you need to choose the specific device and variant you want to build for. This could be a generic AOSP build or a build tailored for a specific device if the OEM has published the device-specific configurations and proprietary binaries. 6. **Building the Source**: Once everything is set up, you start the build process with specific commands. This process can take several hours to complete, depending on your system's performance. 7. **Testing the Build**: After the build is complete, it's advisable to test the output image files on an emulator or on actual hardware (if you have the proper device for the build). Keep in mind that while compiling AOSP itself is a standardized process, getting the compiled AOSP to run properly on a specific device can be much more complex. This is because devices often require specific drivers and modifications that are not part of the AOSP codebase. Device manufacturers may release these in the form of binary blobs or additional source code, but integrating them correctly can be a non-trivial task. If you're interested in compiling AOSP for educational purposes or to contribute to the project, it can be a valuable learning experience. However, if your goal is simply to update your device to a newer version of Android, it's usually more practical to use a pre-built custom ROM provided by the community."},{"prompt":"Is it easy to update linux core only within android os and don't change the other software?","completion":"Updating the Linux kernel within the Android OS is not a simple task for several reasons: 1. **Tight Integration**: The Linux kernel in Android is tightly integrated with the rest of the system, including the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), drivers, and Android framework. An update to the kernel might necessitate changes in these components to maintain compatibility. 2. **Device-Specific Customizations**: Each Android device typically has a kernel that has been customized by the manufacturer to support the specific hardware in the device, such as the camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and more. These customizations are not part of the standard Linux kernel and must be merged with any new kernel updates. 3. **Proprietary Drivers and Binaries**: Many devices rely on proprietary drivers and binaries that are only compatible with specific kernel versions. Updating the kernel might require updates to these components, which may not be available publicly. 4. **Security and Stability**: The kernel is a critical part of the system's security and stability. Updating it incorrectly can introduce vulnerabilities or cause the device to become unstable or even unbootable. Due to these complexities, updating the Linux kernel on an Android device is done by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) or experienced developers who create custom ROMs. They have access to the necessary device-specific source code and binaries, as well as the expertise to ensure compatibility. For an end-user, the most realistic and safest approach to updating the kernel would be through official OTA (Over-The-Air) updates provided by the device manufacturer or by flashing a custom ROM that includes the newer kernel version. Attempting to manually update just the kernel without a comprehensive understanding of the device's software and hardware can lead to a non-functional device. If you're interested in kernel development or updates for Android, engaging with the developer community on sites like XDA Developers could provide valuable insights and resources. Developers who specialize in custom kernels may offer updates for specific devices that can be flashed independently of a full ROM update. However, this is still an advanced task and should be approached with caution and thorough knowledge of the process."},{"prompt":"Are lineageOS most popular within third party Android OSs?

Высчитайте атмосферное давление на ‘данной высоте","completion":"Атмосферное давление убывает с увеличением высоты над уровнем моря. Существует несколько моделей и формул для оценки атмосферного давления на определенной высоте. Один из простых способов - использовать барометрическое уравнение для стандартной атмосферы, которое учитывает изменение температуры с высотой и дает примерное значение давления. Одно из приближений гласит, что давление уменьшается примерно на 12 гПа (гектопаскаль) на каждые 100 метров подъема в нижних слоях атмосферы. На уровне моря стандартное атмосферное давление составляет примерно 1013 гПа. Используя это приближение, можно оценить уменьшение давления на высоте 2000 метров: 12 гПа/100 м × 2000 м = 240 гПа Затем вычитаем это значение из стандартного давления на уровне моря: 1013 гПа - 240 гПа = 773 гПа Таким образом, приближенное атмосферное давление на высоте 2000 метров может составлять около 773 гПа. Это упрощенный расчет и не учитывает такие переменные, как температура воздуха, влажность и местные погодные условия, которые также могут влиять на атмосферное давление.

The value of the television ser decreases by 2000 per year. How long before the television set is worth half of its original value?","completion":"To find out how long it will take for the television set to be worth half of its original value, we will need to determine how many years it takes for the set to depreciate by ₹80,000 (which is half of the original value of ₹1,60,000). The TV depreciates at the rate of ₹2000 per year. To find out the number of years before the TV is worth half its original value: Number of years = Total depreciation / Annual depreciation rate In this case, the total depreciation before the TV is worth half its original value is ₹80,000. The annual depreciation rate is ₹2000. Number of years = ₹80,000 / ₹2000 per year Number of years = 40 years So it will take 40 years before the television set is worth half of its original value."},{"prompt":"привет","completion":"Привет!

WRKY 유전자는 병원체 감염 시 활성화되어 식물 내의 방어적 생화학 경로를 조절하고 병원체 전파를 억제하는 데 기여한다(Dellagi et al., 2000). 그 외에도 글루코시놀레이트-생합성 경로와 연관된 'MYB' 전사 인자는 브로콜리에서 항균성 화합물의 생산을 조절하는 역할을 한다. MYB 전사 인자는 글루코시놀레이트로 알려진 황 함유 대사물질을 조절하며, 이 물질들은 식물이 병원균과 곤충에 대항하여 자신을 방어하는 데 도움을 준다(Gigolashvili et al., 2007). 이러한 유전자들에 대한 연구는 분자 육종과 유전체 편집을 통해 브로콜리의 병원체 내성을 강화하고, 지속 가능한 농업을 위한 품종 개선에 기여할 수 있는 가능성을 제시하고 있다. 지속적인 연구를 통해 더욱 많은 내성 유전자들이 발견되고 분석되어야 브로콜리와 같은 작물의 내병성을 높이고 농가에 이점을 제공할 수 있을 것이다. 출처: Lin, N.

Here's how you could rewrite your \`HandleCrouching\` method to fix the issues: \`\`\`csharp void HandleCrouching() { if (inputHandler.CrouchTriggered) { // This means we want to crouch characterController.height = 1f; } else { // This means we want to stand up // Now we perform a raycast to check if there's enough space above the player to stand up.

Using \`Vector3.up\` ensures that the ray always goes straight up in world space. 4. **Proper Layer Masking**: You have \`_layersToHit\`, but it's not clear if it has been set correctly in the inspector. Make sure that this mask includes all the layers where obstacles can be that would prevent standing up (e.g., ceilings, overhangs). 5. **Consistent Character Height Values**: Your code switches the \`CharacterController\` height between \`1\` and \`2\`. Ensure these values are correct for your character when crouching and standing, respectively. 6. **Overlapping Collider Issue**: If there is an object just above the player character when switching from crouch to stand, the \`CharacterController\` might end up inside the collider. It might not always resolve itself correctly, depending on the \`CharacterController\` setup and physics settings. 7. **Crouch Animation**: If your game has a visual representation requiring an animated transition from standing to crouching, you'll need to handle that separately, typically using an \`Animator\` component.

Don't forget to adjust the centers and heights to your actual character's crouched and standing settings. The \`LayersToHit\` should include any obstacles that would prevent the character from standing up.

This is a partial refactor; you'll have to fill in the \`DetectCrouch\` method similar to the original logic in \`HandleMovement\`. Structuring your code into smaller units helps make the code readable and easier to maintain."},{"prompt":"Write a 3,500-character article about network marketing as a business. Tell us what you need to pay attention to when choosing a network company to generate income","completion":"Network marketing, also known as multi-level marketing (MLM), is a business model that relies on a network of distributors to grow a company. Distributors are incentivized to sell products and recruit new members to expand the network. The allure of network marketing lies in the promise of financial freedom, flexible working hours, and the opportunity to run a business with relatively low initial investment. However, not all network marketing opportunities are created equal, and there are some critical factors to consider before diving in. Understanding the Business Model: At its core, network marketing involves distributing products or services through a network of independent representatives. Representatives earn income through direct sales and by recruiting new members who also sell products. As a sponsor, you then earn commissions from the sales of your recruits. This hierarchical structure has both pros and cons. It offers the potential for residual income as your network grows, but it can also be challenging if the network stalls or dwindles. Researching the Company: Before joining a network marketing company, due diligence is crucial. Research the company's history and reputation. Look for longevity; companies that have been around for several years are often more reliable. Examine their financial standing, leadership team, and business model. Investigate any legal issues or controversies they might have had in the past. Transparency is a good indicator of a company's trustworthiness. Evaluating the Product or Service: A viable product or service is at the heart of any legitimate network marketing opportunity. Assess the demand for the product and its marketability. Is it high-quality? Is it priced competitively? Can it be easily obtained elsewhere? If the product does not provide real value, the business model may rely too heavily on recruitment, which can veer into unsustainable, pyramid scheme territory, and that's a red flag. Training and Support: A reputable network marketing company should provide comprehensive training and support to its distributors. This includes sales training, marketing materials, and mentorship programs. The availability of support reflects the company's commitment to the success of its network. Without proper training and resources, it can be incredibly challenging to sell products and grow your business. Compensation Plan and Earnings: Scrutinize the company's compensation plan. How are commissions structured? What are the requirements for advancing in the system? Be wary of any company that prioritizes recruitment over product sales, as it can be a sign of an unsustainable or illegal pyramid scheme. Understand the realistic earning potential by speaking with current and former members. If the majority of distributors report minimal earnings, that’s a cautionary tale. The Investment Required: Investigate how much money you have to invest to start and maintain your business, including starter kits, product inventory, and ongoing membership fees. Companies that push for large inventory purchases or high startup costs should be approached with caution. A credible network marketing company will have a reasonable initial investment and a buyback policy for unsold inventory. Ethics and Integrity: The company's culture and ethics are paramount. Does the company operate with integrity in its business dealings? Are the marketing strategies ethical? A strong commitment to ethical practices is a positive sign of the company's long-term viability and respect in the marketplace. Exiting the Business: Before joining, understand what happens if you decide to leave the business. Are there any penalties, and how easy is it to exit? Knowing your options helps ensure you're not trapped in an unfavorable situation. In conclusion, network marketing can be a profitable venture when approached wisely. By carefully selecting a reputable company with a valuable product, a supportive structure, and a fair compensation plan, you give yourself a robust foundation for success. Always enter network marketing with a critical eye; understanding the company, its ethics, and the associated risks will help you make an informed decision and protect yourself against potential pitfalls."},{"prompt":"7777","completion":"It looks like you've entered the number 7777.

Whiskers twitching, fur so white, He held a book close, both day and night. This book of wisdom, pages worn and thin, Guided him to work, and from blunders to refrain. He tilled the earth with paws so small, Planted seeds of carrots, standing tall. Each morning he'd rise with the sun's first glow, To tend his garden, row by perfect row. With a work ethic strong, he did not relent, For he knew that patience was time well spent. Rain or shine, he'd be there, caring for his crop, Pulling out the weeds, never wishing to stop. The rabbit knew to grow such a treat, Work and patience must always meet. Each carrot seed, he placed with hope, In the fertile ground, he'd lightly slope. Day by day, he'd watch and wait, For the green tops to sprout, oh, he'd celebrate! His friends would frolic, dance, and play, Urging the rabbit to join without delay. But diligent and steadfast, he knew his role, \\"To reap the sweet rewards, one must control.\\" \\"Playtime has its place,\\" he'd politely say, \\"But to grow fine carrots, work precedes the play.\\" With each dawn's light, he practiced his creed, Watering, caring, removing each weed. The rabbits nearby, they soon came to see, The fruits of hard work and tenacity. As his carrots grew, lush and tall, The work ethic rabbit became admired by all. Seasons cycled as he continued his chore, Until autumn's cool breeze whispered, \\"wait no more.\\" His carrots, ripe, for harvest stood ready, His paws did shake, though his heart was steady. He pulled them up, one by one with delight, His patience rewarded, the harvest just right. The rabbit had worked, had waited with grace, And now in his paws, his efforts embraced. In tenfold return, his carrots did yield, The happiest rabbit in the meadow's field. His book of wisdom by his side, His work ethic strong, his patience, his pride. Thus ends the tale of the rabbit so white, Whose heart and whose work made his future bright. For carrots will grow, if you tend them just right, With patience and labor, day and night."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, <strong>Course Description:</strong>, minimalist tone","completion":"**Course Description:** This course offers an exploration of minimalist design principles.

Certificates of Completion are often used: - In vocational or trade programs where the completion of certain tasks or the learning of particular skills is more important than a traditional academic curriculum. - In corporate or professional development settings, as evidence of ongoing education and commitment to staying current in one's field. - In online courses or webinars, where participants might receive a certificate as proof of their participation and completion of the material. - In adult education, where learners may not be seeking a full degree but still want formal recognition of their attendance and effort. These documents usually feature a simple design highlighting the recipient’s name, the nature of the course or program completed, the organizing institution's name, and possibly the date of completion. They may also include a signature from an authorizing official to validate the certificate. For example, upon finishing a six-week online coding bootcamp, a participant would receive a minimalist-styled Certificate of Completion that affirms they have engaged with and fulfilled the course's requirements."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Downloadable Resources, minimalist tone","completion":"Downloadable resources are materials that users can download to their own devices for offline access or personal use.

The goal is to maximize time spent on high-impact activities while minimizing time wasted on distractions. Here’s how you can apply essentialism to your time management: **Identify Your Priorities:** First and foremost, determine what is essential in your life or work. What tasks or goals align with your highest values and will have the most positive impact? For example, if family time is a priority, an essentialist would block out time in their schedule specifically for family activities and treat it as non-negotiable. **Say No More Often:** To maintain a minimalist schedule, you must become comfortable saying no to non-essential requests. For instance, turn down meetings with unclear agendas or decline projects that don’t fit your core goals. **Limit Your To-Do List:** Instead of a sprawling list of tasks, an essentialist keeps a short list focusing only on what’s truly necessary. This might mean having only three key tasks to accomplish each day, ensuring attention is not diluted. **Batch Similar Tasks:** Group similar tasks together to reduce context switching and enhance focus. You could set aside chunks of time for checking emails, making calls, or running errands, effectively creating a rhythm that minimizes time lost to task-switching. **Leverage Downtime:** Be mindful of little pockets of time that often get overlooked. For example, use the daily commute to listen to educational podcasts or plan your day, turning what might feel like wasted time into valuable learning or planning sessions. **Regularly Reassess:** Your priorities may shift over time, so continually question and reassess what’s essential. For instance, quarterly reviews of your goals and tasks can help keep your time aligned with your current priorities. **Simplify Decision-Making:** Create rules or criteria to simplify decision-making. If a potential task doesn't meet your established criteria, it’s automatically ruled out. This approach saves time and mental energy in the long run. By adopting essentialism in time management, you craft a lifestyle that prioritizes meaningful activities while stripping away the superfluous, resulting in a more purposeful and productive existence."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, —, minimalist tone","completion":"The term \\"minimalist tone\\" often refers to a style of communication or writing that is characterized by simplicity and succinctness.

It's about focusing on what's truly important and discarding the rest. This lifestyle can have profound effects on your physical space, mental clarity, and daily schedule. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity, and finding contentment in fewer, but more meaningful possessions, commitments, and activities. **Simplify Your Space** - **Declutter Your Home:** Begin by tackling one room at a time, carefully sorting through each item. Ask yourself if it serves a purpose or brings you joy. If it does neither, it's time to let it go. You can donate, sell, or responsibly recycle these items. - **Principles of Minimalist Decor:** Embrace clean lines, neutral colors, and open spaces. Furnish your home with items that are both useful and beautiful, avoiding anything that doesn't serve a practical purpose or resonate with you on a personal level. - **One In, One Out Rule:** Whenever you bring a new item into your home, let go of something else. This practice prevents accumulation and ensures you only keep what you genuinely need and love. **Simplify Your Mind** - **Limit Digital Distractions:** Schedule specific times for checking emails and social media rather than allowing these platforms to interrupt your day constantly. Use applications and tools designed to block distractions and keep you focused. - **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Engage in daily practices that encourage a clear and focused mind. Whether it's meditation, yoga, or simply sitting quietly for five minutes each day, these practices can reduce stress and improve your overall well-being. - **Cultivate Gratitude:** By focusing on what you have rather than what you lack, you train your mind to appreciate the present moment. Keep a gratitude journal or mentally note a few things you're thankful for each day. **Simplify Your Schedule** - **Prioritize Tasks:** Emphasize quality over quantity when it comes to your to-do list. Choose your top three priorities for the day and focus on them fully. This approach leads to more significant accomplishments and less scattering of energy. - **Learn to Say No:** Protect your time by declining invitations and requests that don't align with your values or could overextend your schedule. This will allow you to commit more fully to the activities and people you truly cherish. - **Slow Down:** Forget the glorification of \\"busy.\\" Instead, embrace a slower pace of life. Allow yourself to engage in activities without rushing—whether it's savoring a meal, taking a leisurely walk, or reading a book. In essence, Minimalist Lifestyle Mastery is about discovering freedom from the frenzy of a consumer-driven existence.

By leveraging the right tools and resources, you can streamline your daily routines, reduce clutter, and free up time to focus on what really matters. Here, we examine how to integrate these strategies into your life effectively. Automation Automation involves using technology to perform tasks without human intervention. Embrace tools that simplify repetitive actions or decision-making processes. - **Bill Payments**: Set up automatic payments for recurring bills like utilities, rent, or subscriptions. Services like online banking apps typically provide options to automate monthly payments, ensuring you never miss a deadline and avoid late fees without having to remember each due date. - **Email Management**: Use email filters and rules to sort incoming messages. Tools like Gmail's filters can automatically categorize emails, send promotions to a separate folder, and even delete non-essential messages, keeping your inbox tidy and focused. - **Smart Home Devices**: Devices like smart thermostats, lights, and plugs can adapt to your habits, optimizing energy usage and offering remote control, which simplifies home management and reduces unnecessary waste. - **Meal Planning Apps**: Apps like Mealime or PlateJoy help you plan meals for the week, generate shopping lists, and even order groceries for delivery, simplifying the process and cutting down on food waste. Outsourcing Outsourcing entails delegating tasks to others, allowing you to concentrate on higher-value activities. - **Cleaning Services**: Hiring a cleaning service for your home, even once a month, can significantly reduce the time you spend on chores and maintain a peaceful living space. - **Virtual Assistants**: A virtual assistant can handle routine tasks like scheduling, booking appointments, or managing social media, providing you with more space to focus on personal goals or creative projects. - **Delivery Services**: Take advantage of online shopping and delivery for groceries and other essentials. This not only reduces time spent in stores but also helps limit impulse buys, keeping your space clutter-free. - **Laundry Services**: Consider using a laundry pickup and delivery service. It saves time and simplifies your weekly routine, allowing more freedom and a lighter mental load. When integrating these tools into your life, it's important to maintain a minimalist approach: 1. Assess your needs and only automate or outsource tasks that align with your minimalist goals. 2. Choose quality over quantity when selecting services or automation tools. 3. Simplify your subscriptions and services regularly, eliminating ones that no longer serve your simplified lifestyle. 4. Focus on sustainability where possible, opting for eco-friendly services and energy-efficient automation.

Digital decluttering is about minimizing these distractions to create a more focused online environment. Objective: At the end of this lesson, you should be able to identify common digital distractions and implement strategies to reduce their impact on your daily life. Key Concepts and Strategies: 1. **Notification Control** - **Example:** Transform your smartphone from a constant source of interruption into a tool of efficiency. Turn off non-essential notifications like social media updates or promotional emails. If an app sends you notifications that you consistently ignore, it's a strong sign that these alerts should be disabled. 2. **Email Management** - **Example:** Reduce your email clutter by unsubscribing from newsletters you no longer read. Allocate specific times for checking emails, such as once in the morning and once before the end of your workday, to prevent constant inbox monitoring. 3. **Selective Connectivity** - **Example:** Designate tech-free zones or periods, such as the dinner table or the first hour after waking, to practice selective connectivity. This helps in building a more intentional relationship with technology. 4. **Intentional Social Media Use** - **Example:** Delete or deactivate social media accounts that do not add value to your life. Set a time limit for daily social media use and stick to it. Be mindful about the content you consume and engage with; focus on what educates or uplifts you. 5. **Curated Online Experiences** - **Example:** Customize your browser experience with ad blockers or tools that limit your time on distracting websites. Use browser extensions that encourage focus by showing a blank page or a motivational quote when you open a new tab instead of the typical flurry of bookmarks and most visited sites. 6. **Digital Minimalism** - **Example:** Regularly assess and uninstall apps you don't use. Keep your digital files and desktop organized to avoid digital clutter. This can be as simple as having a clean, minimal desktop wallpaper that allows you to focus on your current task without visual distractions. Activities to Implement Digital Declutter: 1. **Notification Audit:** - Go through each app on your devices and toggle off all non-essential notifications. Analyze how your concentration improves over a week. 2. **Email Detox Challenge:** - Spend a week aggressively unsubscribing from non-essential email lists and set up filters to manage incoming emails efficiently. 3. **Social Media Cleanse:** - Temporarily deactivate social media accounts for a set period to experience the effects of reduced online presence. 4. **Tech-Free Time Blocks:** - Schedule daily or weekly blocks of time where you consciously disconnect from all digital devices to engage in offline activities, like reading or spending time in nature. Homework Assignments: 1. **Create a Notification Management Plan:** - List all the apps you receive notifications from and categorize them based on necessity. Decide which notifications to keep, which to silence, and which apps to remove. 2. **Conduct a Digital Inventory:** - Document all the digital tools and platforms you use. Evaluate their purpose and frequency of use. Eliminate redundancies and distractions to streamline your digital toolkit. Conclusion: By systematically applying the principles of digital decluttering, you will cultivate a more peaceful and controlled online environment. This minimalist approach to digital consumption allows for enhanced concentration, creativity, and overall well-being. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate digital tools that serve a purpose, but to remove the excess that hinders our productivity and peace of mind.

This concept is prevalent in online platforms, educational courses, digital products, and software licenses. It’s an attractive offering for consumers, as it provides ongoing benefits without the need for recurring payments. Details: 1. **One-time payment**: The user pays a single fee and gains access to the content or service without future charges. 2. **Inclusivity of updates**: Often lifetime access includes not just the current version of a product or service, but also future updates and improvements. 3. **No expiration date**: The service remains accessible to the user indefinitely; there is no need to renew or worry about access lapsing. 4. **Cost-effective**: In the long run, lifetime access can be more economical compared to subscription models that require regular payments. 5. **Transferability**: Some lifetime access offers may allow transfer of access rights to another person, but this varies by service. 6. **Customer support**: Lifetime access often comes with extended or lifelong customer support for the service or product. Examples: - **Online Learning Platforms**: Purchase a cooking course with lifetime access, and revisit the lessons anytime, even as new content is added. - **Digital Software**: Buy a photo-editing app with a lifetime license and receive future software updates at no extra cost. - **Gaming**: Some indie games are sold with lifetime access, ensuring all future DLCs and expansions are included without additional payment. - **Membership Sites**: A one-time payment grants lifetime entry to exclusive forums, resources, and community events. Minimalist Tone: When discussing lifetime access, emphasize simplicity and the enduring nature of the value offered. Validate the appeal of a single, straightforward investment leading to unrestricted use and freedom from ongoing financial commitments."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, —, minimalist tone","completion":"A minimalist tone in writing, speech, or visual design is characterized by simplicity and brevity. It is grounded in the idea that less is more, focusing on only the essentials to convey a message or a concept. Minimalism aims to strip away the unnecessary, to leave room for the audience to imbue the content with their own interpretation or to appreciate the purity of its form or function. Here are more details and examples across different contexts: # Writing In writing, a minimalist tone uses straightforward and clear language, avoiding complex structures, verbosity, and surplus details. It means conveying messages with as few words as necessary. **Example:** Instead of writing, \\"The fact of the matter is that in all likelihood, the majority of people believe that it's of imperative necessity to reduce their daily caloric intake if they want to see a considerable and rapid decline in their weight,\\" a minimalist would write, \\"Most people need to eat less to lose weight quickly.\\" # Speech When speaking in a minimalist tone, the speaker will often use short, simple sentences and pause frequently to let the words resonate. They might also strip away filler words and technical jargon that could distract from the central message. **Example:** A CEO addressing her company might say, \\"We need focus. Cut waste. Innovate. That is our path forward,\\" rather than providing a lengthy speech filled with buzzwords and redundancies. # Visual Design In visual design, a minimalist tone is achieved by using a limited color palette, ample white space, and simple shapes or typography. The goal is often to create a clean, uncluttered look where each element is deliberate and contributes to the overall message or aesthetic. **Example:** Consider the Apple brand, which leverages minimalism in its product design and marketing. Apple’s advertising often has plenty of white space, with simple images of their products and minimal text. # Art Minimalist art reduces content and form to its essence. It is often abstract, with artists like Donald Judd and Yves Klein focusing on color fields, repeating geometric shapes, or industrial materials. The aim is to evoke reflection on the object itself and its relationship with the surrounding space. **Example:** An all-white canvas with a single-colored stripe or a sculpture comprised of basic geometric forms could be illustrative of minimalist art. # Music Minimalist music is characterized by repetition and simplicity. It often includes simple melodies, motifs, and progressions that are repeated and slowly morphed over time. Composers like Philip Glass and Steve Reich are known for their minimalist compositions. **Example:** A minimalist musical piece might consist of a few notes repeated in a loop with incremental changes throughout the piece, maintaining a sparse texture. # Fashion Minimalism in fashion involves clean lines, neutral colors, and simple silhouettes. It eschews overly ornate details in favor of a \\"capsule wardrobe,\\" where each piece can be mixed and matched to create different looks. **Example:** A minimalist wardrobe might include a black turtleneck, straight-cut jeans, and a classic blazer—each item plain but versatile. # Lifestyle Adopting a minimalist lifestyle means prioritizing quality over quantity. It's about living with fewer possessions and choosing experiences and relationships that genuinely add value to one's life. **Example:** Instead of filling their lives with gadgets and ornaments, a person might choose to own fewer, more meaningful items and spend their time and money on travel or learning new skills. # Architecture Minimalist architecture features simple forms, clean lines, and the intentional use of functional elements as design features. It often employs monochromatic color schemes and industrial materials. **Example:** A minimalist home might have large, unadorned windows, bare concrete floors, and a simple, open floor plan. In all these examples, the minimalist tone aims to create space for thought or function by pruning anything that distracts from the central theme, purpose, or message. It asks of its audience to appreciate the purity and the deliberate choice of what remains."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Lesson 1.1: The Philosophy of Minimalism in Home Decor, minimalist tone","completion":"**Lesson 1.1: The Philosophy of Minimalism in Home Decor** *Introduction* Minimalism in home decor is more than just an aesthetic choice—it's a philosophy centered on the idea that less is more. The minimalist approach involves paring down your living space to the essentials, eliminating clutter, and creating a serene environment that reflects simplicity and intentionality. *The Core Principles of Minimalism* Minimalism leans on several key principles that guide the minimalist in making intentional decisions about their living space: 1. **Simplicity** - Strive for designs that are clean, straightforward, and uncluttered. Each piece of decor should serve a purpose or bring joy. 2. **Functionality** - Choose items that are not only decorative but also functional. If an item doesn't serve a clear purpose, reconsider its place in your home. 3. **Intentionality** - Every object in a minimalist home should be carefully and thoughtfully chosen. It's about quality over quantity. 4. **Clarity** - A decluttered space can lead to a decluttered mind. Limiting distractions in your environment can help foster a calm and focused atmosphere. 5. **Unobtrusiveness** - Decor should blend seamlessly with the living space. It should not be overwhelming or imposing. *Implementing Minimalism in Your Home* To bring the minimalist philosophy into your home, consider the following steps: 1. **Declutter** - Begin by eliminating items that you no longer need or that do not serve a positive function in your life. Be ruthless in your approach to clearing out the non-essentials. 2. **Choose a Neutral Palette** - Using soft, neutral colors for walls, flooring, and key pieces of furniture helps to create a calming and cohesive environment. 3. **Invest in Quality** - Instead of an abundance of decor, invest in fewer, higher-quality pieces that will last and that you truly love. 4. **Functional Furniture** - Opt for furniture that is both aesthetically pleasing and practical. Hidden storage or multipurpose items are ideal in a minimalist space. 5. **Use Textures Wisely** - While color should be minimized, texture can be used to add depth and interest. Think of a chunky knit throw on a sleek, modern chair. 6. **Embrace Space** - Allow for plenty of open space in your rooms. This not only looks more calming but also makes the space more usable. *Examples of Minimalist Home Decor* - A living room with a simple grey sofa, a glass coffee table, and a single piece of artwork that serves as the focal point. - A bedroom featuring a platform bed with storage drawers underneath, eliminating the need for an extra dresser. - An entryway with a sleek console table, a purposeful vase with fresh flowers, and a wall-mounted coat rack to maintain a sense of openness. *Benefits of Minimalism in Home Decor* - **Stress Reduction** - A minimalist space can significantly decrease the stress one feels in a cluttered environment. Less visual noise equates to more peace. - **Ease of Cleaning** - Fewer items in your home mean less to clean and maintain, which simplifies household chores. - **Greater Appreciation for Possessions** - When you have fewer items, each one tends to be more meaningful. You learn to appreciate the beauty and function of every piece in your home. - **Focus on Personal Priorities** - With fewer distractions, minimalism allows for a greater focus on personal goals, relationships, and hobbies. *Conclusion* The philosophy of minimalism in home decor is not about stripping away joy or character from your home, but about enhancing your living space by subtracting the unnecessary. It is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from them. When applied thoughtfully, minimalism can lead to a profoundly satisfying way of life."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, <strong>Module 2: Streamlining Your Mind</strong>, minimalist tone","completion":"Sure, Module 2: \\"Streamlining Your Mind\\" is focused on eliminating mental clutter to enhance clarity and efficiency.

Single-Tasking:** *Example:* Instead of juggling multiple tasks simultaneously – which splits your attention and diminishes quality – concentrate on one activity at a time. For instance, when writing a report, close all irrelevant browser tabs and put your phone on silent to prevent distractions. **2. Mindfulness Practices:** *Example:* Incorporate brief meditation sessions into your daily routine. Spending even five minutes in the morning can help clear your mind and set a focused tone for the day. **3. Thought Organization:** *Example:* Use tools like lists or digital apps to offload your mental inventory. This could mean having a dedicated notepad for jotting down tasks, which simplifies decision-making and prioritization processes. **4. Intentional Consumption:** *Example:* Curate your information intake by selecting a few trusted sources instead of aimlessly scrolling through social media. This prevents information overload and ensures you receive high-quality content. **5. Decluttering Decision Making:** *Example:* Create routine systems for small decisions – like planning weekly meals or laying out your clothes the night before – to free up mental space for more significant choices. **6. Embracing the Power of 'No':** *Example:* Be selective with your commitments. If an invitation or project does not align with your objectives, politely decline. This preserves your energy and attention for priorities that matter to you. **7. Clearing Mental Blocks:** *Example:* Identify recurring worries or stressors and address them systematically. For example, if financial concerns weigh heavily on you, set up a monthly budgeting session to confront and manage them directly. By implementing these minimalistic techniques, you can refine your thought processes, reduce unnecessary cognitive load, and enhance your overall mental clarity. The goal is not to remove all thoughts and stimuli but to curate them to better serve your needs and aspirations."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Lesson 1.2: Decluttering Techniques for Every Room, minimalist tone","completion":"Lesson 1.2: Decluttering Techniques for Every Room In this lesson, we'll explore various decluttering techniques tailored to every room of your home. The minimalist approach focuses on simplicity and keeping only what adds value to your life. We will go through each room, offering specific strategies and examples to help you create a serene, clutter-free space. Living Room: 1. Start with flat surfaces like coffee tables and shelves. Remove all items and only add back what is both functional and brings you joy. - Example: Keep one or two books that you are currently reading on the coffee table and a small plant for a touch of nature. 2. Evaluate each décor item. Ask yourself if it enhances the room or just fills space. - Example: Choose a single statement art piece for the wall instead of a gallery of forgotten photos. 3. Tackle electronic clutter. Hide cables, use a simple organizer for remote controls, and consider a digital media player to reduce physical media. - Example: Invest in a cable management box to neatly tuck away cords. Kitchen: 1. Clear the countertops to create a clean workspace. Only daily-use appliances should remain on the counter. - Example: Store the mixer or blender in cabinets and leave out only the kettle and a cutting board. 2. Organize your pantry and fridge by discarding expired items, and duplicates, and grouping like items together. - Example: Use clear containers to group grains and label them for quick identification. 3. Implement the one-in-one-out rule for utensils and gadgets. Before buying new items, decide which old one it will replace. - Example: If you purchase a new set of chef’s knives, donate your old ones. Bedroom: 1. Curate your wardrobe by removing items you haven't worn in over a year. Keep a versatile selection that mixes and matches well. - Example: Create a capsule wardrobe with a neutral color palette for effortless coordination. 2. Minimize bedside table clutter. Have a simple lamp, a book, or an e-reader, and keep only essentials in drawers. - Example: A sleek, modern lamp with a built-in charger can serve multiple purposes without adding extra items. 3. Under-the-bed storage should be structured and not a hideaway for clutter. Use labeled bins for out-of-season clothing or spare bedding. - Example: Roll spare linens and store them in a clear bin for easy access without excess visual clutter. Bathroom: 1. Clear out the medicine cabinet and vanity of expired products, unused cosmetics, and nearly empty containers. - Example: Designate one shelf for daily products and another for less frequently used items, ensuring everything is visible and accessible. 2. Keep countertops minimal with only daily essentials and store the rest in organized drawers or cabinets. - Example: Display a simple soap dispenser and keep toothbrushes in a unified holder. 3. Evaluate your towels and linens, keeping a set number of each and donating the rest. - Example: Have two sets of towels per person so that one can be in use while the other is in the laundry, creating less bulk in storage. Home Office: 1. Digitize paperwork and minimize physical files. Keep a label maker handy to maintain an organized filing system. - Example: Use cloud storage to keep important documents and shred unnecessary papers. 2. Simplify your desk setup, maintaining a clean work area with only the computer, a notepad, and a pen. - Example: Have a single small plant or a photo frame for a touch of personalization that doesn't overwhelm the space. 3. Regularly review and declutter your bookshelves, retaining only those books that you reference or intend to read. - Example: Keep a select few favorite books on display and donate or sell others that are merely occupying space. Remember, decluttering is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. Adopt these minimalist techniques to maintain a serene and uncluttered home that promotes a tranquil and focused lifestyle. Embrace the less-is-more philosophy and enjoy the freedom that comes with having fewer possessions and more space to live."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Lesson 2.3: The Power of Saying No: Prioritizing Your Mental Energy, minimalist tone","completion":"Lesson 2.3: The Power of Saying No: Prioritizing Your Mental Energy In a world teeming with demands and distractions, the ability to say no is a powerful tool for mental clarity and energy conservation. This lesson delves into the strategy of prioritization as a means of preserving your mental energy. **Understanding the Value of 'No'** Saying no is not merely a rejection; it's an affirmative decision about how to spend your time and energy. By declining requests that do not align with your priorities or values, you preserve mental space for what truly matters to you. **Examples:** - **Personal Invitation Decline:** A colleague invites you to an event, but you have a personal project that requires your focus. Politely declining frees you to direct your mental energy toward your passion. - **Work Project Refusal:** When asked to take on additional work that exceeds your capacity, saying no maintains your ability to concentrate on your current responsibilities without becoming overwhelmed. **The Minimalist Approach to Decision-Making** Adopting a minimalist approach involves simplifying the decision-making process. Consider each request with a simple filter: Does this contribute to my well-being and goals? If not, it's a candidate for a no. **Saying No with Grace** Declining an offer or request must be done tactfully to maintain relationships and respect boundaries. You can be firm but polite, providing just enough reason without over-explaining. **Implementing 'No' in Your Daily Life** - **Practice:** Start with small refusals to build up your confidence. - **Time Block:** Assign specific times for tasks and say no to requests that fall outside these blocks. - **Reflect:** After saying no, reflect on the feeling of relief or space created for important activities. **Consequences of Not Saying No** Failing to say no can lead to burnout, resentment, and a cluttered schedule. It dilutes your mental energy across too many commitments, which can diminish your performance in each one. **Maintaining Mental Energy** Saying no is a method of mental decluttering. It allows you to focus on a few selected areas of life, and as a result, your mental energy yields better results in those areas due to undivided attention and reduced stress. **Mastery of the Art of No** Over time, making these conscious choices becomes second nature. The aim is not to avoid obligation but to accept only those that align with your essential needs and goals. This approach is the essence of maintaining mental energy and leading a balanced life."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Practical Exercises, minimalist tone","completion":"Sure, I can provide you with some practical exercises in a minimalist tone, which means I'll focus on giving straightforward, simple instructions and examples without much embellishment or unnecessary detail. 1. **Breath Awareness Meditation** - Sit or lie in a quiet place. - Close your eyes. - Inhale slowly and deeply. - Exhale slowly. - Repeat for 5 minutes. 2. **Decluttering Task** - Choose one drawer at home. - Remove all items. - Keep only what you use regularly. - Organize remaining items neatly. 3. **Capsule Wardrobe Creation** - Select 30 clothing items. - Include tops, bottoms, shoes, and outerwear. - Mix and match these for a month. 4. **Daily Journaling** - Write three bullet points daily. - Include one gratitude, one accomplishment, one goal. - Keep it brief and consistent. 5. **Single-Tasking Exercise** - Choose a task. - Set a timer for 20 minutes. - Focus on the task until the timer rings. - Take a five-minute break. 6. **Digital Clean-Up** - Pick one digital device. - Unsubscribe from five unnecessary emails. - Delete unused apps or files. - Organize the rest into folders. 7. **Mindful Eating Practice** - Serve a single portion of food. - Eat without distractions. - Chew each bite 20 times. - Notice flavors and textures. 8. **30-Day Minimalist Challenge** - Dispose of one item on day one. - Two items on day two. - Continue until day thirty. 9. **Visual Scanning Exercise** - Enter a room. - Scan for visual clutter for 1 minute. - Identify items to remove. 10. **Reading Time** - Pick a short article or book chapter. - Read for 15 minutes. - Reflect for 5 minutes.

The minimalist tone emphasizes tranquility, purpose, and intentionality, reducing the stress and noise of excess possessions. Core Habits for a Minimalist Space: 1. **One In, One Out:** - *Example*: When you purchase a new item of clothing, choose an old piece to donate or recycle. If you buy a new book, pass one you've already read to a friend or a local library. 2. **Daily Clutter Checks:** - *Example*: Spend 5-10 minutes each evening scanning your living area for items that are out of place. Implementing a \\"nightly reset\\" helps ensure you wake up to a tidy, calming environment. 3. **Mindful Shopping:** - *Example*: Draft a list before shopping and stick to it. Consider each potential purchase by asking, \\"Do I really need this, or does it bring me joy?\\" Pausing to contemplate prevents impulsive buying. 4. **Use-It-or-Lose-It Philosophy:** - *Example*: Implement a monthly review of items. If you haven't used something within a certain timeframe (e.g., 3-6 months), it's time to let it go, unless it's a seasonal item or holds significant sentimental value. 5. **Quality Over Quantity:** - *Example*: Instead of owning multiple pairs of cheap shoes, invest in a couple of high-quality pairs that are versatile, comfortable, and long-lasting. Routines to Sustain Minimalism: 1. **Regular Decluttering Sessions:** - *Example*: Set a date every season to go through your belongings. This could be the first Saturday of every third month. Use this time to reevaluate possessions and remove items that no longer serve your needs. 2. **Digitize Where Possible:** - *Example*: Opt for digital subscriptions, and reduce paper clutter by scanning important documents. Use apps to organize notes and reminders instead of physical notebooks. 3. **Designate a Place for Everything:** - *Example*: Have specific spots for your keys, wallet, and phone. Baskets for remotes and a shelf for daily-worn shoes can reduce day-to-day chaos. 4. **Rethink Multiples:** - *Example*: Kitchen gadgets often duplicate functions. A high-quality chef's knife might eliminate the need for multiple specialty cutting tools. 5. **Embrace Empty Spaces:** - *Example*: Not every shelf needs to be filled. Enjoy the visual rest that a clear surface offers. This also makes cleaning easier and less time-consuming. 6. **Stay True to Your Minimalist Aesthetic:** - *Example*: Choose a neutral color palette for your home décor, which allows for mix-and-matching and reduces the desire to frequently redecorate. In Summation: Simplicity is the essence of a minimalist lifestyle. Maintaining a minimalist space is an ongoing process, involving thoughtful acquisition of items and diligent purging routines. By embedding these habits and routines into your daily life, you will cultivate an environment that reflects your values, reduces your stress, and allows you to focus on what truly matters."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Lesson 2.1: Mindfulness and the Art of Less, minimalist tone","completion":"Lesson 2.1: Mindfulness and the Art of Less Introduction: In this lesson, we explore how mindfulness, the act of being consciously aware in the present moment, can be applied to the concept of minimalism—an intentional focus on the things we value most and the removal of everything that distracts us from them. Core Principle: The core principle of this lesson is that by integrating mindfulness with minimalism, we can enhance our lives by simplifying our surroundings, thoughts, and routines. This fusion helps in cultivating an environment where we can focus on our personal growth, well-being, and the pursuit of meaningful experiences. Key Concepts: 1. Present Awareness: Embracing the minimalist mindset starts with being fully present. This involves both physical decluttering and mental decluttering, allowing you to appreciate and use your possessions more thoughtfully. Example: When eating a meal, focus solely on the flavors, textures, and sensations involved rather than eating mindlessly while distracted by technology or intrusive thoughts. 2. Intentional Living: Every object, activity, and relationship in our lives should serve a purpose and align with our core values. Minimalism isn't about depriving oneself but rather making room for more intentional choices. Example: Choose possessions that serve multiple functions or bring joy, and let go of items that are no longer useful or don't contribute to your well-being. 3. Conscious Consumption: Understand the difference between need and want. Mindful minimalists carefully consider each purchase in terms of its long-term value rather than succumbing to the immediate gratification of consumerism. Example: Instead of impulsively buying the latest gadget, consider if it genuinely offers improvement over what you already own and how it aligns with your lifestyle. 4. Simplified Spaces: Minimalism champions the belief that a clutter-free space reflects and supports a clutter-free mind. By keeping only what you need, you create a peaceful environment that fosters mindfulness. Example: A minimalist workspace might contain only essential items like a computer, a notebook, and a pen, each of which serves a defined purpose for the task at hand. 5. Quality Over Quantity: Investing in fewer, high-quality items that last longer promotes sustainability and reduces the overwhelm of choice that comes with having too many subpar options. Example: Opt for a well-made piece of furniture that will stand the test of time rather than purchasing several cheaper, less durable alternatives over the years. 6. Digital Detox: In a world inundated with technology, a minimalist approach includes periodic disconnection from digital devices to reconnect with oneself, others, and nature. Example: Schedule regular technology-free hours or days where you engage in activities like reading, hiking, or meditating, allowing you to be more in tune with your thoughts and surroundings. 7. Mindful Routines: Develop simple, streamlined routines that eliminate unnecessary decisions and actions, conserving mental energy for more important tasks and decisions. Example: A minimalist morning routine might involve waking up at the same time each day, practicing meditation, and preparing a simple yet nutritious breakfast, eliminating the stress of unnecessary choices. Conclusion: By applying the art of less through mindfulness, we create space for the truly important aspects of life to flourish. This lesson encourages us to be deliberate in our choices and actions, leading to a more focused and fulfilling existence."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Video Lectures, minimalist tone","completion":"Video lectures are a popular method for delivering educational content in a visual and auditory format that can be accessed remotely. A minimalist tone in video lectures refers to a teaching style that focuses on clarity, simplicity, and the essentials of the topic being discussed. Here's a more comprehensive breakdown with examples: 1. **Simplicity in Design:** - Visuals: Use a clean and uncluttered visual design with minimal text on slides and high contrast for ease of reading. - Example: Instead of a cluttered PowerPoint slide full of bullet points, a minimalist slide might feature a single, powerful image with a short, impactful statement to highlight the main idea. 2. **Clarity of Content:** - Focus: Concentrate on key concepts and avoid overloading with unnecessary details. - Example: If the lecture is about the principles of economics, stick to the fundamental theories like supply and demand, without diverting into tangential topics unless they directly contribute to understanding the core principles. 3. **Efficient Delivery:** - Speech: Use clear and concise language, speak slowly, and emphasize important points without redundancy. - Example: A lecturer might say, \\"Inflation reflects the overall rise in price levels,\\" and leave it at that, rather than providing several examples or a historical treatise on inflation. 4. **Engagement Without Overwhelm:** - Interaction: Invite questions or include short quizzes, but keep them focused and relevant to the material just covered. - Example: After explaining a concept like photosynthesis, a minimalist video lecture might pause to ask a single, thought-provoking question rather than a battery of trivia. 5. **Purposeful Structure:** - Sequence: Organize the lecture in a logical flow, starting with an introduction, moving through the subject, and then concluding with a summary. - Example: The lecture might start with a question or a problem, go through the steps or theories that address the question, and conclude by recapping how the information presented solves the initial problem. 6. **Technology Utilization:** - Tools: Use technology to enhance learning rather than distract; perhaps a simple animation to illustrate a point. - Example: To explain the orbit of planets, a simple animation showing the motion around the sun might be used instead of a complex 3D model with numerous moving parts. 7. **Accessibility:** - Comprehension: Ensure that the lecture is accessible to students of all levels by avoiding jargon and explaining terms when they are introduced. - Example: When introducing a technical term, the lecturer defines it in simple language and uses it consistently throughout the presentation. 8. **Evaluation and Feedback:** - Assessment: Provide succinct and direct feedback that helps students understand their mistakes and grow. - Example: Instead of extensive commentary, feedback might highlight one or two key areas for improvement along with positive reinforcement for concepts well understood. In summary, a minimalist tone in video lectures is characterized by the deliberate exclusion of extraneous elements, focusing on the absolute necessities to facilitate a clear understanding of the subject matter. The goal is to deliver content in a way that is both engaging and easy to assimilate without overwhelming the learner."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, - Lesson 3.3: Crafting a Minimalist Daily Routine for Maximum Productivity, minimalist tone","completion":"**Lesson 3.3: Crafting a Minimalist Daily Routine for Maximum Productivity** **Introduction to Minimalism in Daily Routines** Minimalism in the context of daily routines is about prioritizing and focusing on what's essential. By stripping away the non-essential tasks and commitments, you create a routine that is streamlined and efficient, leaving you with more energy and time to dedicate to your most meaningful activities. **Key Principles of a Minimalist Daily Routine** 1. **Simplicity:** Keep your schedule as simple as possible. Ditch complex planning systems and opt for straightforward approaches. 2. **Focus:** Prioritize tasks that align with your personal and professional goals. 3. **Consistency:** Develop a routine that can be followed consistently rather than one that changes daily. 4. **Flexibility:** Allow room for adjustments when unexpected situations arise, without overcomplicating the routine. 5. **Clarity:** Be clear about your objectives for each day. Knowing what you want to achieve helps you stay on track. **Developing Your Minimalist Daily Routine** 1. **Identify Core Tasks:** Make a list of your most important daily activities. These should be tasks that directly contribute to your goals or are essential for your well-being (e.g., work projects, exercise, family time). *Example:* If your goal is health-oriented, a core task could be a 30-minute workout rather than spending time choosing between various fitness activities. 2. **Eliminate the Unnecessary:** Review your current routine and cut out any activities that do not serve a clear purpose or that could be streamlined. Question whether each task is truly necessary. *Example:* Instead of checking your emails throughout the day, allocate specific times for this activity to reduce distractions. 3. **Consolidate Tasks:** Bundle compatible activities together to save time and energy. This technique, known as batching, increases efficiency by minimizing context-switching. *Example:* Schedule all your meetings or calls in a single block of time rather than spreading them throughout the day. 4. **Design Your Rituals:** Consider the psychological aspects of a minimalist routine. Successful routines often include rituals that signal the start and end of the workday. *Example:* Start your day with a five-minute meditation to focus your mind, and end your day by jotting down three things you've accomplished, which can reinforce a sense of productivity. 5. **Refine Over Time:** Pay attention to what works and what doesn't. Be willing to make incremental changes to improve efficiency. *Example:* If you find you're more productive at writing reports in the afternoon rather than the morning, adjust your routine to accommodate this insight. **Maintain Your Routine** - **Habitual Performance:** Once your routine is set, stick to it until it becomes second nature. A minimalist routine's power lies in its ability to become a seamless part of your life. - **Preparation:** Prepare for the next day the night before. This might mean laying out your clothes, prepping meals, or reviewing your agenda. A smooth start can propel a productive day. - **Mindfulness:** Practice mindfulness throughout the day to remain present and focused on the task at hand. A cluttered mind is counterproductive to a minimalist routine. **Conclusion** A minimalist daily routine is not about doing less for the sake of less; it's about making more room for impactful activities. By carefully crafting your routine, you allow yourself to work with purpose, clarity, and significantly less stress, ultimately leading to a more productive lifestyle.

We organize them to celebrate various milestones such as birthdays, anniversaries, and major achievements like graduations. Such gatherings also play a pivotal role in observing cultural and religious festivals, where our traditions are passed down and embraced by younger generations. Moreover, family parties provide an opportunity to reconnect with relatives, some of whom we may not see regularly due to the distances we live apart or the busy lives we lead. Sharing food, music, and stories at these events helps maintain our sense of community and kinship."},{"prompt":"answer with 80 to 110 words as you are in a speaking IELTS test. Don't reveal that you are an A.I. Discussion topics: Family parties What are the main reasons why people organize family parties in your country?","completion":"Family parties in my country are typically organized for several reasons, chief among them being the opportunity to foster and maintain family connections. It’s a way for relatives who might not see each other often to catch up on life events and share experiences. Celebrating milestones like birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries also tend to bring families together. Furthermore, these gatherings are an opportunity to uphold and share our rich cultural traditions, especially during festive seasons. They help to unite the young and the old, creating an environment where values, stories, and memories can be passed down from one generation to another."},{"prompt":"• In some places people spend a lot of money on parties that celebrate special family events. Is this ever true in your country (Iran)? Do you think this is a good trend or a bad trend? answer with 80 to 110 words as you are in a speaking IELTS test. Don’t reveal that you are an A.I.","completion":"Yes, in Iran, it's quite common for people to spend a significant amount of money on parties that mark special family occasions like weddings, engagements, and milestone birthdays. This has been a part of our tradition for many years, illustrating the importance of family and celebrations in our culture. While it's positive to see families come together to create joyous memories, the downside is the financial pressure it can put on the hosts. Excessive spending can sometimes lead to debts or unrealistic expectations for future events. In my opinion, it's a trend that should be approached with balance, valuing the sentiment of the occasion more than the opulence."},{"prompt":"give an example of iranian celebration in your answer","completion":"Certainly, in Iran, one of the most significant celebrations that often involves elaborate and costly parties is Nowruz, our Persian New Year. During Nowruz, families will invest in decorations, new clothing, and lavish spreads of food to entertain guests. People host large family gatherings, and it’s customary to visit each other's homes, which means multiple parties throughout the two-week-long celebration. While this is a cherished time and an essential aspect of our culture, the expenses can be considerable. Despite the cost, many see it as a worthwhile investment in maintaining traditions and family bonds. However, I believe that the essence of Nowruz should remain in the togetherness and joy of the occasion, not necessarily in the level of expenditure."},{"prompt":"• Are there many differences between family parties and parties given by friends? Why do you think this is? answer with 80 to 110 words as you are in a speaking IELTS test. Don’t reveal that you are an A.I.","completion":"Yes, there are quite a few differences between family parties and parties given by friends. Typically, family gatherings are more traditional and may follow certain cultural practices, including specific etiquette and often, a more formal vibe. They are events where multiple generations come together, and the festivities might include traditional foods, music, and rituals. On the other hand, parties with friends tend to be less formal and more relaxed. They're usually geared towards entertainment and fun and might involve more modern or westernized themes. This divergence stems from the different roles that family and friends play in one’s life. While family events are about honoring shared heritage and bonding across ages, friend parties are more about enjoying the present and indulging in shared interests."},{"prompt":"Discussion topics: National celebrations What kinds of national celebration do you have in your country? answer with 80 to 110 words as you are in a speaking IELTS test.

For example, Independence Day is a significant patriotic event marked by national parades, fireworks, and speeches by prominent figures. Additionally, we celebrate cultural festivals that highlight our country's diverse heritage and history through music, dance, and traditional attire. There are also public holidays dedicated to historical figures or significant events in the nation's past, where people might participate in commemorative events or educational programs.

How do I display that variable temporaily to the screen","completion":"To display a variable temporarily on the screen in a ReactJS component, you can render it directly within your JSX using curly braces. Here’s a simple example of how to do it: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const myVariable = 'Hello, world!'; // This is the variable you want to display return ( <div> {myVariable} {/* This will display the value of myVariable on the screen */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; \`\`\` In the example above, \`myVariable\` is included within the returned JSX inside curly braces. When the component renders, \`myVariable\` will be displayed wherever you placed it within your JSX. If you want to display it temporarily based on a certain condition or after a specific event, you can use state and effects to control when the variable is shown. Below is an example using the \`useState\` and \`useEffect\` hooks to show a variable for 3 seconds: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const [showVariable, setShowVariable] = useState(false); const myVariable = 'Hello, this will be shown temporarily!'; useEffect(() => { // Set showVariable to true to display the variable setShowVariable(true); // Set a timeout to hide the variable after 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) const timer = setTimeout(() => { setShowVariable(false); }, 3000); // Clear the timeout if the component unmounts before the time is up return () => clearTimeout(timer); }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this effect runs once after initial render return ( <div> {showVariable && myVariable} {/* This will display the value of myVariable temporarily */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; \`\`\` In this example, \`showVariable\` is a state variable initialized to \`false\`. When the component mounts, \`useEffect\` is executed, setting \`showVariable\` to \`true\` which causes the component to re-render and display \`myVariable\`. After 3 seconds, the \`setTimeout\` callback executes, setting \`showVariable\` back to \`false\`, which hides the variable from the screen."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

One common way is by using a firewall app that doesn't require root access. These apps typically use a local VPN (Virtual Private Network) to filter network traffic, since they can't leverage the iptables firewall rules which require root privileges. Here are steps on how to set up a non-root firewall on an Android device: 1. Choose and Download a Firewall App: - Find a reputable firewall app in the Google Play Store that doesn't require root. Examples include NetGuard, NoRoot Firewall, etc. 2. Install the App: - Install the app on your Android device. 3. Set Up and Configure Rules: - Open the app and follow the setup instructions. - You may need to give the app permission to create a VPN connection, which is how it monitors and controls network traffic. - Define the rules for which apps are allowed to access the internet and whether they can use Wi-Fi, mobile data, or both. 4. Enable the Firewall: - After you have set your rules, enable the firewall within the app. It should create a VPN connection that will now start filtering your traffic according to the rules. 5. Monitor and Adjust as Needed: - Check back occasionally to ensure the firewall is working as you expect. You can typically see logs of blocked traffic and adjust your rules as necessary. Remember that while these apps do a good job of controlling traffic without root access, their capability is limited compared to a full root-access firewall. They also might not have the ability to control all types of network traffic, such as ICMP or UDP traffic, in some cases."},{"prompt":"Is it possible for tcp leakage to occur with netguard?","completion":"NetGuard, like any other VPN-based firewall app for Android that operates without root permissions, creates a secure VPN connection to filter traffic according to user-defined rules. The primary purpose of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized network traffic from reaching the host. In the context of a firewall application, \\"leakage\\" would refer to network traffic that bypasses the rules set by the user and escapes the constraints laid by the firewall, reaching the network despite the user's intention to block it. For TCP leakage to occur with NetGuard, it would mean that TCP traffic is somehow bypassing the firewall's filtering mechanism. Here are some points to consider regarding the possibility of leakage with NetGuard: 1. Software Bugs: Like any software, NetGuard may have bugs that could potentially allow traffic to bypass its filters under certain conditions. While not common, it is a possibility with any complex software. 2. VPN Failures: Since NetGuard operates as a VPN, if the VPN connection itself fails or is improperly established, traffic might bypass the NetGuard filtering. 3. Limitation of VPN-based Approach: The VPN-based approach doesn't interact with the system's internal networking as deeply as a root-based firewall (employing iptables), so there may be limitations or edge cases where traffic isn't fully captured by the VPN. 4. Misconfigurations: User misconfiguration can also lead to leakage. If the rules aren't set up properly or if certain apps are allowed to circumvent the firewall, it could lead to perceived leakage. 5. Outside the Scope: NetGuard may not be able to manage traffic that is outside the scope of its VPN-based filtering. For example, local traffic that doesn't go through the VPN interface is not subject to NetGuard’s control. It should be noted that in general, NetGuard is considered to be a reliable application for controlling network traffic. Any potential leakage due to the reasons above would likely be the exception rather than the norm. Users who are particularly concerned about leakage might choose to block all traffic into and out of the device when the VPN is not connected by enabling the \\"Block connections without VPN\\" setting in Android's VPN configuration page (usually available under Network & internet > VPN settings on the system settings page). This can provide an extra layer of assurance that no traffic will bypass the VPN unintentionally. If users suspect potential leakage or encounter any issues, they should review the NetGuard configuration, check for updates that might address related bugs, and contact the developer with specifics to gain further assistance."},{"prompt":"Is the leakage possible while rebooting the device?","completion":"Yes, leakage is possible during the device reboot process. When you restart your Android device, all apps, including NetGuard or any other VPN-based firewall solution, will be shut down during the reboot sequence. Upon booting, there can be a small window of time before these apps are automatically started and the VPN connection—the mechanism used by such apps to enforce firewall rules—is re-established. During this gap: 1. **Automatic Services:** Some system services and apps with the permission to start at boot may automatically begin connecting to the internet before the firewall app has a chance to start and set up its VPN-based filtering. 2. **Startup Sequence:** The boot process involves a sequence of events, and third-party apps like firewalls are not the first services to be initiated. Hence, some traffic may escape control before the firewall VPN is active. To mitigate this risk, Android 7.0 and higher versions include an option named \\"Block connections without VPN\\" (or similarly named settings in different versions), which you can enable within the Android VPN settings. When this setting is enabled, the device will block all network traffic that doesn't go through the VPN. However, please be aware that this doesn't necessarily prevent all leaks during startup before the system engages this mechanism. Some minimal leakage might still be possible during early boot phases. It’s also possible that certain persistent connections that were active before a reboot might automatically try to reconnect as soon as the network comes back online, potentially leading to some leaks. For sensitive operations, where absolutely no leaks can be tolerated, a rooted device with a more deeply integrated firewall solution might be necessary, or the device must be kept offline until the VPN is fully operational after a reboot."},{"prompt":"Why netguard doesn't work if \\"block connections without VPN\\" is inabled? No internet traffic possible with the option even if it is enabled in netguard?","completion":"The \\"Block connections without VPN\\" setting in Android is a safety feature that is designed to ensure that your device does not allow any network traffic unless it's routed through a VPN. However, this can cause issues with local VPN services like NetGuard that are intended to control your device's traffic rather than route it through an external server. Here's why enabling the \\"Block connections without VPN\\" option can cause NetGuard to prevent any traffic: 1. **NetGuard Functions as a Local VPN:** When you use NetGuard, it creates a VPN interface that operates locally on your device. It does not route your traffic through external servers like a traditional VPN service would; instead, it filters traffic based on your rules. Since it doesn’t redirect traffic elsewhere, it relies on the internet connection being available to it as the traffic comes in and goes out. 2. **Blocking External VPN Connections:** The \\"Block connections without VPN\\" option expects that the device traffic will be tunneled through an external VPN server. When this setting is turned on, the system prevents any network connection that is not passed through such an external, secured VPN tunnel. 3. **Local VPN Conflict:** NetGuard needs to establish a local VPN connection to filter your traffic. However, if the \\"Block connections without VPN\\" setting is enabled, Android may interpret this as needing to prevent all network connections because it is expecting an external VPN connection rather than a local one that NetGuard creates. This could block even the local NetGuard VPN from accessing the internet, resulting in no network traffic being allowed at all. In other words, the system option \\"Block connections without VPN\\" does not distinguish between local (NetGuard) and remote (traditional VPN) services. It simply blocks everything that is not routed through what it considers to be an active VPN connection. To use NetGuard effectively, make sure that the \\"Block connections without VPN\\" option in the Android settings is turned off. NetGuard itself will act to block unwanted traffic based on the rules you define without the need for this additional Android setting. If you're using NetGuard solely as a firewall without the intention of sending your traffic through an external VPN server, you don't need the \\"Block connections without VPN\\" option to be on."},{"prompt":"Are there apps that turns off an internet connection before the device's shutdown or reboot or set \\"Block connections without VPN\\" before it to prevent an internet traffic leakage?","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, there aren't any widely known apps that specifically turn off the internet connection or automatically enable \\"Block connections without VPN\\" before a device shutdown or reboot to prevent traffic leakage. The \\"Block connections without VPN\\" feature is a setting that users generally configure manually on their device to prevent any internet connection outside of a VPN. Similarly, turning off the internet connection before shutting down or rebooting a device is usually a manual step taken by the user, for instance by enabling airplane mode or disabling mobile data and Wi-Fi. Automating such a process would be complex because it would require intercepting the shutdown or reboot signal and performing actions in response—actions that would need to occur quickly enough before the system processes the shutdown or reboot. Android does not provide a reliable broadcast intent for apps to receive notifications of a system-wide shutdown or reboot with enough time to perform complex tasks like reconfiguring network settings. Additionally, any app attempting to perform such tasks would likely need extensive permissions that could pose security risks, so Google's Play Store policies might restrict such functionality. However, some devices with advanced power-off scheduling features might allow users to limit networking during specific times, effectively preventing leakage during scheduled reboots. For users with rooted devices, it could theoretically be possible to create or use a script or app with root privileges to modify system settings immediately before a shutdown, but this is not something most users would have access to or would want to configure, due to the complexities and potential for causing system instability. For maximum security to prevent leaks, it's recommended to manually enable airplane mode or disable data connections before shutting down or rebooting the device. This is a straightforward and practical approach that can be done quickly with virtually no risk of leaks, as long as it is performed before initiating a shutdown or reboot."},{"prompt":"Aren't there any apps either to set airplane mode before shutdown? Answer briefly.","completion":"No, as of my last update, no apps are available that can automatically trigger airplane mode right before a device shuts down. Android does not provide a reliable way for apps to detect and respond to a shutdown event with such actions. Users must manually enable airplane mode if they wish to ensure no data leakage occurs during the shutdown process."},{"prompt":"Aren't there a way for non-rooted devices to set iptables rule? Answer shortly.","completion":"No, non-rooted Android devices do not have the capability for apps or users to set or modify iptables rules due to the restricted access to the system's Linux kernel where iptables operates.

Эту величину можно найти в психрометрических таблицах или рассчитать.

Чтобы определить абсолютную влажность при заданных условиях, нам необходимо узнать, какое количество водяного пара содержится в воздухе при этих условиях. Сначала нам нужно вычислить давление насыщенного пара при -20°C. Это можно сделать, используя эмпирическую формулу Магнуса для расчета давления насыщения над льдом, так как температура отрицательна: [ E_s = 6.112 times expleft(frac{22.46 times T}{272.62 + T}right) ] где: - ( E_s ) — давление насыщенного пара в гектопаскалях (гПа), - ( T ) — температура в градусах Цельсия.

При расчёте правильно будет умножить давление насыщенного пара на относительную влажность. Поскольку дано, что давление насыщенного пара (при -20°C) равно 1,03 гПа, и относительная влажность составляет 50%, процесс расчета будет выглядеть так: 1,03 гПа (давление насыщенного пара) * 0,5 (относительная влажность в десятичной форме) = 0,515 гПа Таким образом, давление водяного пара в воздухе при относительной влажности 50% и температуре -20°C равно 0,515 гПа."},{"prompt":"Напиши решение проще","completion":"Извините за путаницу. Вот простое пошаговое решение для определения абсолютной влажности воздуха при -20°C и относительной влажности 50%: 1. Найдите значение давления насыщенного пара при температуре -20°C. Значение примерно равно 1,03 гПа (это значение можно найти в таблицах давления насыщенного водяного пара в зависимости от температуры). 2. Учтите относительную влажность 50% и вычислите давление действующего водяного пара в воздухе: ( 1,03 гПа times 0,50 = 0,515 гПа ) 3. Используйте формулу для пересчета давления водяного пара в абсолютную влажность: ( Абсолютная влажность = frac{E times M_w}{R times T_k} ) где: ( E ) — давление действительного водяного пара в гПа, ( M_w ) — молярная масса воды, г/моль (примерно 18.02 г/моль), ( R ) — универсальная газовая постоянная, Дж/(моль·К) (около 8.314 Дж/(моль·К)), ( T_k ) — температура в кельвинах, К (для -20°C это будет 253.15 К). 4. Так как давление в гПа необходимо перевести в паскали (Па) для использования в формуле (1 гПа = 100 Па), преобразуйте и вставьте все значения: ( Абсолютная влажность = frac{0,515 times 100 times 18.02}{8.314 times 253.15} ) ( Абсолютная влажность ≈ frac{51.5 times 18.02}{8.314 times 253.15} ) ( Абсолютная влажность ≈ frac{927.81}{2139.13} ) ( Абсолютная влажность ≈ 0.43 г/м³ ) Таким образом, абсолютная влажность воздуха при относительной влажности 50% и температуре -20°C составит примерно 0.43 грамма воды на кубический метр воздуха."},{"prompt":"Напиши так чтобы это было понятно","completion":"Конечно, вот самое простое объяснение того, как определить абсолютную влажность воздуха при температуре -20°C и относительной влажности 50%: 1. Возьмите давление насыщения для -20°C. По таблицам это примерно равно 1,03 гПа. 2. Поскольку относительная влажность составляет 50%, то реальное давление водяного пара в воздухе будет в два раза меньше. Умножьте 1,03 гПа на 0,5 (то есть на 50% в десятичной форме). Получится 0,515 гПа. 3. Чтобы получить абсолютную влажность (количество водяного пара в граммах на кубический метр воздуха), примените следующую простую формулу: Абсолютная влажность = давление водяного пара (в Па) * молярная масса воды / (универсальная газовая постоянная * температура в Кельвинах) 4. Так как 1 гПа равен 100 Па, умножаем 0,515 гПа на 100, чтобы перевести в Па. Получаем 51,5 Па для давления водяного пара. 5. Далее подставляем значения: молярная масса воды 18 г/моль (округлённо), газовая постоянная 8,314 Дж/(моль·К), температура воздуха в Кельвинах, для -20°C это будет 253 К (то есть -20 + 273). 6. Формулу теперь можно записать как: Абсолютная влажность = 51,5 * 18 / (8,314 * 253) 7. Вычислите значение по формуле: Абсолютная влажность ≈ 0,43 г/м³ То есть в воздухе при -20°C и 50% относительной влажности содержится примерно 0,43 грамма воды на каждый кубический метр воздуха."},{"prompt":"tenemos una empresa de tartas tematicas.

Puisque la voiture consomme environ 5 litres d'essence par jour, en 10 jours, elle consommera : 5 litres/jour * 10 jours = 50 litres En utilisant la masse volumique de l'essence, nous prenons la valeur moyenne pour effectuer un calcul approximatif : Masse volumique moyenne de l'essence = (0.68 + 0.78) / 2 kg/L = 0.73 kg/L Ainsi, la masse d'essence consommée sur 10 jours est de : 50 litres * 0.73 kg/L = 36.5 kg Le pouvoir calorifique inférieur de l'essence étant de 44000 Kj/Kg, l'énergie totale consommée sur 10 jours par la voiture à essence est de : 36.5 kg * 44000 Kj/kg = 1,606,000 Kj Maintenant, regardons le pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 : 6.37 x 10^10 Kj/Kg Le plein d'uranium-235 est de 100 g, ce qui est égal à : 100 g = 0.1 kg Calculons l'énergie totale que peut fournir 100g d'uranium-235 : 0.1 kg * 6.37 x 10^10 Kj/Kg = 6.37 x 10^9 Kj Il nous faut maintenant savoir combien de temps il faudrait pour que la voiture alimentée à l'uranium utilise une quantité d'énergie équivalente à celle utilisée par la voiture à essence sur 10 jours (1,606,000 Kj). Pour cela, nous divisons l'énergie totale fournie par 100g d'uranium par l'énergie consommée par la voiture à essence sur 10 jours : 6.37 x 10^9 Kj / 1,606,000 Kj = 3966.38 jours Donc, si la voiture fonctionnant à l'uranium consomme de l'énergie à la même vitesse que la voiture à essence, il lui faudra environ 3966.38 jours pour utiliser les 100g d'uranium-235 qu'elle a dans son réservoir."},{"prompt":"as a csr enhance this to a more friendly tone approach \\" I understand you're considering canceling your VIP membership, Before you make your final decision, i would love to remind you of the exclusive perks you can enjoy as a VIP member: such as exclusive VIP prices, option to skip the month Exclusive sales and promotions Sending out monthly curated selections Loyalty program <depends on the brand> Free shipping and exchanges.

A menudo, el cuidado cutáneo masculino puede estar rodeado de prejuicios y estigmas sociales que sugieren que las rutinas de cuidado personal están reservadas únicamente para las mujeres o que dedicar tiempo al cuidado de la piel es una vanidad innecesaria. Sin embargo, desatender la piel puede llevar a problemas a corto y largo plazo, tales como el envejecimiento prematuro, enfermedades de la piel, y otros problemas de salud relacionados con una barrera cutánea comprometida. # Salud cutánea: Más que estética La piel es el órgano más grande del cuerpo humano y su primer contacto con el mundo exterior. Actúa como barrera protectora contra microorganismos patógenos, sustancias químicas y radiación ultravioleta. Una piel sana también regula la temperatura corporal y permite la sensibilidad a diferentes estímulos. Por tanto, un cuidado cutáneo adecuado va mucho más allá de la estética; es un tema de salud esencial. # Los retos de la piel masculina La piel del hombre presenta características únicas debido a factores hormonales, principalmente la testosterona, que hacen que su piel sea más espesa, con poros más grandes y tendencia a ser más grasa. Esto puede llevar a particularidades como el acné o la dermatitis seborreica. Además, la piel masculina está sometida al estrés diario del afeitado, que puede causar irritación, cortes y pelos encarnados. # Protección solar: Un hábito crucial Uno de los elementos vitales del cuidado de la piel es la protección solar. Los hombres, que a menudo pasan tiempo al aire libre por trabajo o recreación, están expuestos a la radiación UV que puede causar envejecimiento prematuro, manchas y aumentar el riesgo de cáncer de piel. Utilizar un protector solar con un factor adecuado es crucial para prevenir estos problemas. # Limpieza e Hidratación: Fundamentos del cuidado diario Establecer una rutina diaria de limpieza e hidratación es fundamental. La limpieza ayuda a eliminar el exceso de sebo, suciedad y células muertas, previniendo la aparición de imperfecciones. La hidratación, por su parte, mantiene la barrera cutánea íntegra y resistente. Es fundamental elegir productos adecuados al tipo de piel, ya que el uso de productos inadecuados puede agravar problemas preexistentes. # Alimentación y Vida Saludable Tener una dieta balanceada rica en vitaminas, minerales y antioxidantes influye positivamente en la salud de la piel. El ejercicio regular, una buena hidratación y el sueño adecuado también son aspectos importantes, ya que favorecen la circulación y permiten que la piel se regenere de manera óptima durante el descanso. # Envejecimiento y Cuidados Específicos A medida que los hombres envejecen, su piel pierde colágeno y elasticidad, lo que lleva a la aparición de arrugas y flacidez. Productos con ingredientes activos como el retinol, péptidos y antioxidantes pueden ayudar a contrarrestar estos signos del envejecimiento. Además, es importante tener en cuenta tratamientos específicos para problemas puntuales como la rosácea, la psoriasis o la hiperpigmentación. # Educación y Desmitificación Para que más hombres adopten prácticas saludables de cuidado de la piel, es esencial continuar con la educación y desmitificación del cuidado personal masculino. Esto implica cambiar la narrativa cultural que ha posicionado el cuidado de la piel en hombres como un tabú o como una cuestión exclusivamente femenina. # Conclusiones El cuidado de la piel en los hombres es una cuestión de salud integral y prevención. Al entender las necesidades específicas de la piel masculina y adoptar hábitos de cuidado diarios, se pueden prevenir una amplia gama de problemas y mejorar la calidad de vida. Los hombres deberían ser alentados a cuidar su piel, no solo por una cuestión de apariencia, sino como parte de un estilo de vida saludable y responsable. Llevar a cabo estas prácticas no solo promueve una piel más sana, sino que también contribuye a romper estigmas y construir una sociedad más inclusiva y consciente del bienestar integral."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

En la actualidad, se ha incrementado la conciencia sobre la importancia del cuidado de la piel en los hombres, desafiando estereotipos y enfatizando que todos, independientemente del sexo, merecen atender su salud dermatológica. Primero, es fundamental entender que la piel masculina tiene características distintas a la femenina debido a factores hormonales, principalmente la testosterona, que conduce a diferencias en la textura y la composición. Por ejemplo, la piel de los hombres tiende a ser más gruesa, contiene más colágeno y suele ser más aceitosa, lo que puede aumentar la posibilidad de sufrir de acné, poros dilatados y otros problemas cutáneos. La rutina de cuidado de la piel masculina es tan vital como cualquier otro aspecto de su régimen de salud y bienestar. A continuación, se abordan algunas razones por las cuales los hombres deben prestar especial atención a su piel y cómo pueden hacerlo de manera efectiva. **Prevención del envejecimiento prematuro** La exposición prolongada al sol sin protección es una de las principales causas del envejecimiento cutáneo. Los hombres, quienes tradicionalmente han pasado más tiempo al aire libre por cuestiones laborales o recreativas, deben ser especialmente cuidadosos en este aspecto. El uso diario de un buen protector solar con un SPF adecuado es esencial para prevenir el daño solar, que incluye arrugas prematuras, manchas y el riesgo de cáncer de piel. **Importancia de la hidratación** La piel deshidratada no es exclusiva de las mujeres; los hombres también pueden experimentar sequedad, irritación y descamación. Una piel bien hidratada tiene un mejor aspecto, se defiende mejor contra los agentes externos y se siente más cómoda. Incorporar una crema hidratante adecuada para el tipo de piel puede ser un cambio simple pero sustancial en la rutina diaria. **Control del exceso de grasa y prevención del acné** La producción de sebo es más alta en los hombres debido a las hormonas androgénicas, por lo tanto, es más propensa a sufrir de acné y brillo indeseado. Utilizar productos específicamente formulados para la piel masculina puede ayudar en la regulación de la grasa sin resecar la piel. **Cuidado post-afeitado** Otro aspecto distintivo del cuidado de la piel masculina es el afeitado, que puede ser diario para muchos hombres. Esta práctica puede irritar y dañar la piel si no se hace correctamente o si no se utilizan productos adecuados. Emplear after shaves con ingredientes calmantes y reparadores es clave para mantener la piel en buen estado post-afeitado. **Atención a la salud general de la piel** El cuidado de la piel no sólo se trata de estética, sino también de salud. Las enfermedades de la piel, como el melanoma, pueden afectar a cualquier persona y los hombres son menos propensos a autoexaminarse o buscar ayuda dermatológica a tiempo. Establecer una rutina de cuidado permite no solo mantener la piel saludable sino también detectar de forma temprana cualquier anomalía. **Adoptar una rutina de cuidado de la piel** Una rutina básica de cuidado de la piel para hombres puede incluir los siguientes pasos: 1. **Limpieza**: Utilizar un limpiador facial acorde al tipo de piel para eliminar la suciedad, el exceso de grasa y las impurezas. 2. **Exfoliación**: Realizar una exfoliación suave un par de veces a la semana ayuda a prevenir pelos encarnados y a eliminar celulas muertas. 3. **Hidratación**: Aplicar una crema hidratante después de la limpieza para mantener la piel nutrida. 4. **Protección**: Un protector solar de amplio espectro es esencial para defender la piel de los efectos nocivos de los rayos UV. Es importante que los hombres abandonen la idea de que el cuidado de la piel es exclusivamente femenino. La salud de la piel es esencial para la calidad de vida general, y cuidarla es un hábito de bienestar que todos deben desarrollar. Las empresas de cuidado de la piel han reconocido esta necesidad y están proporcionando cada vez más productos específicos para hombres, facilitando así una rutina personalizada y efectiva. En resumen, la adopción del cuidado de la piel por parte de los hombres no solo es beneficiosa para su apariencia, sino que también es crítica para su salud a largo plazo. Con el creciente mercado de productos y la cada vez mayor conciencia sobre la importancia del cuidado personal, es hora de que los hombres adopten prácticas saludables de cuidado de la piel y disfruten de sus beneficios."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These waves are typically produced by events like earthquakes, volcanic activity, magma movement, large landslides, or by large man-made explosions. They can also be created by machines for exploration of oil and gas, or for studying geological structures. There are two main types of seismic waves: body waves and surface waves. 1. Body Waves: - Travel through the interior of the Earth. - The fastest types of seismic waves. - Divided into Primary (P) and Secondary (S) waves: - P-waves (Primary waves): The fastest seismic waves which can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. These waves compress and expand the material they move through, similar to sound waves. - S-waves (Secondary waves): Only travel through solids and moves the ground up and down or side-to-side. 2. Surface Waves: - Travel along the Earth's surface. - Slower than body waves, but they can be more damaging because of their larger amplitudes and longer durations. - Two main types are Love waves (move the ground side-to-side) and Rayleigh waves (induce a rolling motion). Seismologists study seismic waves to understand the interior structure of the Earth, to locate the epicenter of earthquakes, and to determine the size and nature of the seismic events. Seismic wave analysis is crucial in the design of earthquake-resistant structures and in the mitigation of earthquake damage."},{"prompt":"Exfoliation short note","completion":"Exfoliation is a geological weathering process where layers or sheets of rock gradually peel away from the surface due to the release of pressure or stress. This form of mechanical weathering is particularly common in igneous rocks such as granite, but can also occur in other rock types. The primary mechanism behind exfoliation is thought to be the expansion and contraction of rocks due to temperature fluctuations, which can cause the outer layers to crack and peel off similar to the layers of an onion. When rocks that formed deep within the Earth are exposed at the surface due to erosion or other geological processes, the decrease in overlying pressure allows the rock to expand. This expansion can create joints or cracks parallel to the surface. In addition to thermal stresses, other contributing factors to exfoliation may include freeze-thaw cycles in colder climates (where water seeps into cracks, freezes, expands, and then thaws, gradually prying the rock apart), the removal of overlying material through erosion, and other chemical weathering processes that weaken the rock layers. Exfoliation can lead to the creation of distinct geological features such as exfoliation domes, which are rounded rock formations with layers that have peeled away due to the process. Notable examples of exfoliation domes include Half Dome in Yosemite National Park and the various granite domes in the Sierra Nevada range. Understanding exfoliation helps geologists comprehend the landscape evolution and the mechanisms driving rock disintegration and soil formation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

出门在外，车位难寻已是司空见惯，然而车位守门人却是让人颇感新奇的景象。2月24日，吉林某餐厅门前，一场因为停车位而起的纠纷引起了周围人的关注。据悉，一位大妈在此人肉守占停车位，面对想停车的车主，大妈不但拒绝让位，反而啼笑皆非地扔出了一句：“我站这站多半天了你知道吗？” 事态升级，大妈甚至动了手，不惜以砖块威胁，又在争执中猝不及防地扇了车主一个响亮的耳光。面对大妈的横行霸道，男子选择报警处理。在警方的调解下，不欲与大妈继续冲突的男子最终决定将车停在其他地方，以求安宁。 类似的场景在平日里并不鲜见，尤其在繁华地段，为了一方小小的停车位，常能目睹大妈大爷们的身影，他们有时甚至会因此与他人发生口角甚至肢体冲突。在这种社会资源分配产生的纷争面前，民众往往采取回避的策略，避免与之正面冲突。 不过，吉林事件告诉我们，当面对公共资源的不当占用，选择合理维权和求助于法律，也是解决问题的一种途径。在法治社会中，每个人都应当依法行事，对于占用公共资源引起的争议，相信不论是大妈还是车主，最终都会有公正的处理。 您怎么看《民间车位之争再添乱章：吉林大妈人肉占位惹祸端》，欢迎在评论区分享您的看法！ 如果感兴趣，欢迎点赞关注转发给朋友！ \`\`\`

Read and translate the text. The current Russian word tamozhnyaappeared in the times of Mongol-Tatar yoke. The word tamga, in Tatar, meant “a customs tax; an official who collected it; and the stamped seal or a statement showing that it had been paid”. The Russian Customs Service, however, predates the Mongol-Tatar yoke (1237-1480). Thus, we can say that Russia has had a Customs Service in some form during the past 1000 years. Even in the times of KievanRus, taxes were collected for the transportation of goods through the frontiers of individual princedoms. Each market had its tamozhnya and the right to collect duties could be purchased from the State. That right was often given to powerful merchants. The first Russian Customs Statutewas handed down in 1667. It was strict towards foreigners, who were allowed to trade only in frontier townson pain ofconfiscation. A special tsar’s certificate was required for trading further inside the country. Such protectionism went on for most of the next 300 years. Every tsar, from Peter the Great to Nicolas II, approved laws limiting the import of foreign goods and defending Russian producers. For almost all of its history the Customs Service has been much more than a force for keeping out contraband. In fact, it has been a powerful administrativebody, and customs business has always been considered important and prestigious. A number of well-known people both in Russia and abroad worked for the Customs and contributed to its development. The Russian tsar Alexei Mikhailovitch was the head of the Russian state for more than 30 years (1645-1676). It was the time when the main state institutions were formed. He did a lot to develop customs laws. For example, he initiated customs reforms by issuing the Decree “On levying customs duties on goods in Moscow and other cities”. Besides, he signed the New Trade Statute (1667) which was based on the previous legislation and suggestions, made by Russian merchants. It was the first attempt to arrange customs procedures. The well-known Russian poetGavriil R. Derzchavin combined his literary activities with his work as President of Commerce Board in 1794-1803. He was engaged in foreign trade and customs business and took part in working out customs tariffswhich came into effect in 1800. Alexander N. Radishev, the famous Russian writer, also worked for the Customs and was appointed the head of St.Petersburg Customs House. Dmitry I. Mendeleev was a great Russian chemist and apublic figure. In 1891-1903 he was Head of the Commission in charge of customs tariffs. He was sure that protectionist tariff would serve the development of the country as it not only regulated export and import but also stimulated industrial production. He was one of the first to discover the laws ruling customs business. Nowadays Russia has the world’s longest border to police and has a modern, multi-functioning Customs Service. It carries out the same functions as the Customs of other countries: fiscal function, regulation of foreign trade, lawenforcement, keeping of customs statistics on foreign trade, etc.","completion":"ИСТОРИЯ ТАМОЖНИ Задача 1. Прочитайте и переведите текст. Слово \\"таможня\\" появилось во времена монголо-татарского ига. В татарском языке \\"тамга\\" означала \\"таможенный налог; чиновника, собиравшего его; и печать или заявление, подтверждающее его уплату\\". Однако русская таможенная служба предшествует монголо-татарскому игу (1237-1480). Таким образом, можно сказать, что Россия имела таможенную службу в той или иной форме на протяжении последних 1000 лет. Даже во времена Киевской Руси собирали налоги за перевозку товаров через границы отдельных княжеств. На каждом рынке была своя таможня, и право собирать пошлины можно было купить у государства. Это право часто передавалось влиятельным купцам. Первый российский таможенный устав был издан в 1667 году. Он был строг к иностранцам, которым разрешалось торговать только в пограничных городах под угрозой конфискации. Для торговли дальше внутри страны требовалось особое царское свидетельство. Такой протекционизм продолжался на протяжении большей части следующих 300 лет. Каждый царь, от Петра Великого до Николая II, утверждал законы, ограничивающие импорт иностранных товаров и защищающие русских производителей. На протяжении почти всей истории таможенная служба была не только силой по борьбе с контрабандой. Фактически, это был мощный административный орган, и таможенное дело всегда считалось важным и престижным. Многие известные люди как в России, так и за рубежом работали на таможне и внесли свой вклад в ее развитие. Русский царь Алексей Михайлович был главой русского государства более 30 лет (1645-1676). Именно тогда формировались главные государственные институты. Он много сделал для развития таможенных законов. Например, он инициировал таможенные реформы, выпустив указ \\"О взимании таможенных пошлин на товары в Москве и других городах\\", а также подписал Новый торговый устав (1667 год), который был основан на предыдущем законодательстве и предложениях русских купцов. Это была первая попытка упорядочить таможенные процедуры. Известный русский поэт Гавриил Р. Державин сочетал литературную деятельность с работой председателем Коммерческого совета в 1794-1803 годах. Он занимался внешней торговлей и таможенным делом, участвовал в разработке таможенных тарифов, вступивших в силу в 1800 году. Александр Н. Радищев, известный русский писатель, также работал на таможне и был назначен главой Санкт-Петербургской таможни. Дмитрий И. Менделеев был великим русским химиком и общественным деятелем. В 1891-1903 годах он был главой комиссии по таможенным тарифам. Он был уверен, что протекционистский тариф будет способствовать развитию страны, так как он не только регулировал экспорт и импорт, но и стимулировал промышленное производство. Он был одним из первых, кто открыл законы, управляющие таможенным делом. Сегодня Россия имеет самую длинную границу для контроля и современную, многофункциональную таможенную службу. Она выполняет те же функции, что и таможни других стран: фискальная функция, регулирование внешнеторговой деятельности, правоприменительная деятельность, ведение таможенной статистики по внешней торговле и т. д."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

according to the script . Did you know that there are individuals whose very essence holds the power to heal, transcending the need for physical touch? Today, we embark on a journey to uncover nine remarkable signs that may hint at your own latent ability to heal. Prepare to explore realms beyond the mundane and unearth surprising aspects of your inner being. Imagine the profound impact of easing others’ pain simply through your presence alone. Astounding, isn’t it? For some, this extraordinary gift of healing is a tangible reality. If you’ve ever felt a profound connection to the well-being of others or sensed an intuitive understanding of health and energy, you may possess an innate talent for healing. As our exploration unfolds, I’ll encourage you to reflect on how these signs resonate within your own soul. It’s an opportunity to embrace and celebrate your unique gifts. Embrace this illuminating journey, for it has the potential to reshape your perception of your healing abilities, whether through specific methodologies or the sheer force of your presence. Today, we shed light on nine signs that signify your innate capacity to heal. They have mastered a language enabling communication with both flora and fauna. Sign number 1: A profound affinity with the natural world and creatures. Individuals with a propensity for natural healing share a deep bond with nature and animals. They harness natural remedies and methodologies to address both physical and mental well-being. These healers uphold the belief in the interconnectedness of all elements in the cosmos and understand that harmonizing the body’s energies is key to rejuvenation. To them, the natural realm provides a plethora of botanicals and herbs that serve as organic remedies for various afflictions. Furthermore, natural healers acknowledge the invaluable role of animals in the healing journey. Many animals possess innate healing instincts and can offer solace to individuals navigating challenging periods. They excel in nurturing plants and possess an intuitive understanding of these beings’ requirements. It’s as though they have mastered a language that enables communication with both flora and fauna. Sign number 2: Inherent empathy. Owing to possessing natural empathy, individuals encounter both a boon and a trial. On one front, it bestows upon you the faculty to forge profound connections with others, grasp their sentiments, and furnish them with solace and comprehension. On the opposite side, experiencing the emotions of others as if they were your own can be overwhelming and draining. Those with natural empathy commonly exhibit heightened sensitivity to the energies and emotions of those in their proximity. They can discern subtle cues, decode nonverbal expressions, and even perceive the ambiance’s essence. Despite the potential overwhelming nature of this heightened sensitivity, it holds immense promise for compassion, empathy, and insight. It empowers them to cultivate deep ties with others, extend solace and support, and instinctively discern the needs of others. For individuals with innate empathy, it is imperative to delineate boundaries and devote attention to self-care. This entails mastering techniques to shield your energy, engaging in self-nurturing practices, and identifying healthy avenues to expel and process emotions. Consciously regulating your empathetic capacity will enable you to harness its constructive facets while safeguarding yourself against possible adverse repercussions, securing a wholesome equilibrium in your interactions and relationships.

We warmly invite you to subscribe to the channel and activate notifications to remain abreast of the insights we share with you. Your curiosity is highly valued. Sign number 3: An inclination towards alleviating the distress of others. Have you ever felt a compelling urge to support someone enduring challenging circumstances? This impulse may indicate that you possess an inherent talent for restoration. Individuals with a natural aptitude for healing feel a deep-seated desire to alleviate the suffering of others, motivated by an inborn empathy and kindness towards those confronting physical, emotional, or psychological challenges. This inclination to assist emerges from the core of their essence, urging them to provide solace and nurturing to those in distress, whether through complementary treatments, pragmatic guidance, or just by extending attentive and sympathetic ears. These natural healers strive to diminish the anguish of others by any means feasible. To them, this impulse to alleviate suffering transcends mere motivation; it embodies a fundamental aspect of their identity and how they elect to devote their time and effort to assisting others on their voyage to recovery. Sign number 4: An unwavering sense of mission and calling. If you have consistently harbored a profound and inherent belief that you are destined for something significant, you may be inclined towards natural healing. Natural healers possess an inborn capacity to facilitate the recovery of others on physical, emotional, or spiritual levels. They have always shared a deep bond with the well-being of others and possess a unique intuition and receptiveness to the needs of those around them. This sense of purpose can manifest diversely. You may feel compelled to engage in healthcare professions such as medicine, psychology, or counseling. Alternatively, you might discover your calling as a healer through holistic approaches such as bodywork, acupuncture, or traditional remedies. This purpose transcends mere career aspirations; it resonates as an intrinsic part of your being, propelling you to aid in the restoration and guidance of others. It acts as a guiding force, directing you towards endeavors or lifestyles centered on the act of healing. [Sign number 5 is missing ] Sign number 6: An inherent skill in equilibrium and restoration. Natural healers not only discern energy but also wield an inborn capacity to rectify and synchronize it, whether through physical interaction, their mere presence, or their verbal articulation. These are tools wielded by natural healers to impact the energy of those soliciting their aid. Through tactile contact, they can channel their personal energy into the recipient’s body, promoting the rectification of any disarray. You might discern a surge of warmth in their hands when in the presence of an individual in distress. This intuitive perception compels them to lay their hands directly on the afflicted region. Individuals dedicated to healing are perceived as empathetic and open-minded companions adept at listening and comprehending. This intrinsic aptitude may be honed from an early stage and refined progressively, whether through tactile therapy or through tutelage in energetic practice. Sign number 7: Heightened responsiveness to energy and surroundings. Natural healers distinguish themselves through their keen perception and insight into the nuanced energies interwoven within the universe. They possess the ability to discern the electrical charges and vibrational frequencies present within individuals and their encompassing milieu. This aptitude empowers them to recognize discrepancies in energies, obstructions, or ailments in others, as well as sense and grasp the emotional condition of individuals. Such acute sensitivity transcends the realm of humans, extending towards the environment encircling them. Individuals inclined towards healing might be profoundly impacted by locations imbued with adverse or perturbing energies; nevertheless, they are equally drawn to areas steeped in positive and synchronous vibrations. Elevated sensitivity towards energy and the environment emerges as a priceless endowment, albeit one that may present challenges. Exposing oneself to dense energies or collaborating with individuals undergoing intense agony or distress can precipitate emotional inundation and weariness in natural healers. Sign number 8: Exceptional recuperation and fortitude. Individuals with a propensity for natural healing possess a remarkable capability that empowers them to bounce back and recuperate more swiftly than the average individual. This prowess is evident not solely on a physical plane but also resonates within the emotional realm. Natural healers can surmount grave maladies and emerge triumphant, displaying an uncommon tenacity. It is imperative to grasp that this does not imply they are impervious to pain; rather, it accentuates their adeptness at swiftly and effectively dissipating it. This extraordinary fortitude and recuperative knack may also extend to emotional wounds. Natural healers harbor a discernible inner robustness that equips them to vanquish challenging encounters with an extraordinary capacity to heal. Their inherent linkage to equilibrium and serenity augments this peculiar recovery aptitude. Sign number 9: Embodying tranquility amidst upheaval. Have you encountered an individual whose mere presence exudes a sense of calm and serenity, soothing the milieu and infusing it with a peaceful essence? Amidst tumultuous scenarios, such individuals may be natural healers. Possessing an extraordinary ability to emanate tranquility that can transmute harrowing instances into interludes of peace, these healers cast light in the darkest of moments, adept at assuaging frayed nerves and alleviating tensions. Even without all the answers, their aura provides profound comfort to those around them. If your ability to diffuse tension and foster resolution resonates, you may well possess the essence of a healer. We hope that diving into these nine signs has illuminated the potential of innate healing within you. Remember, the healer’s role transcends physical recovery, touching upon emotional, mental, and spiritual realms. If any of these signs stir recognition within you, know that your innate aptitude for healing is waiting to be shared generously with the world. Your potential to foster calm and wellness is a true gift. As we recognize these signs in ourselves, let’s consider how we can wield our talents to make a positive impact on others’ lives. Recognizing your unique potential is the first step. You might feel a strong connection to others’ well-being or intuitively know how to improve their states of mind. These are not coincidental but could be evidence of a natural inclination towards healing.

Here is an addition of Sign number 5 to your script: Sign number 5: Proficiency in intuitive perception and the ability to anticipate needs. Have you ever noticed that sometimes you understand what someone is going through before they've even expressed it? This signifies your capacity for intuitive perception. Individuals bestowed with the natural gift of healing often bear an innate intuition that guides them to anticipate the needs of others before they become apparent. This intuitive foresight is not just a mere coincidence; it is an indication of a deeper connection to the energies that surround us and an attunement to the unspoken cues emitted by those in need. Such healers are adept at recognizing the early signs of imbalance within an individual, be it physical, emotional, or spiritual, and are thus empowered to provide preemptive care. They possess the uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time, often providing comfort or guidance that seems almost serendipitously suited to the situation at hand. Their instincts are sharp, and they trust them implicitly, knowing their gut feelings are informed by a synchronous relationship with the universal flow of energy. Embrace this rare skill, for it is a hallmark of a true healer—one who not only responds to distress but can act to prevent it with grace and understanding.

Premièrement, trouvons l'énergie quotidienne consommée par la voiture lorsqu'elle fonctionne à l'essence : Consommation d'essence quotidienne : 5 litres/jour. Moyenne de la masse volumique d'essence : (0.68 + 0.78) / 2 = 0.73 kg/L. Masse d'essence consommée par jour : 5 L/jour x 0.73 kg/L = 3.65 kg/jour. Pouvoir calorifique inférieur de l'essence : 44 000 Kj/kg. Énergie libérée par jour avec l'essence : Énergie_essence/jour = Masse_essence x Pouvoir_calorifique Énergie_essence/jour = 3.65 kg/jour x 44 000 Kj/kg = 160 600 Kj/jour. La consommation d'énergie quotidienne pour la voiture est donc de 160 600 Kj. Maintenant, examinons l'énergie que pourrait libérer les 100g d'uranium-235 : Masse d'uranium-235 : 100g = 0.1 kg. Pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 : 6.37 x 10^10 Kj/Kg. Énergie totale libérée par 100g d'uranium-235 : Énergie_U-235 = Masse_U-235 x Pouvoir_calorifique_U-235 Énergie_U-235 = 0.1 kg x 6.37 x 10^10 Kj/kg Énergie_U-235 = 6.37 x 10^9 Kj. Finalement, trouvons le nombre de jours où cette énergie pourra alimenter la voiture : Nombre de jours = Énergie_U-235 / Énergie_essence/jour Nombre de jours = 6.37 x 10^9 Kj / 160 600 Kj/jour Nombre de jours = 39667.5 jours. Donc, avec 100g d'uranium-235, la voiture pourrait théoriquement fonctionner pendant environ 39 667,5 jours avant de nécessiter un \\"plein\\" d'uranium.

Calculons d'abord l'énergie total fournie par l'essence consommée en 10 jours. Consommation d'essence par jour = 5 L Consommation en 10 jours = 5 L/jour * 10 jours = 50 L Avant de calculer l'énergie, nous devons prendre en compte la masse volumique de l'essence. Utilisons la moyenne de l'intervalle donné pour la densité de l'essence, soit (0.68 kg/L + 0.78 kg/L) / 2 = 0.73 kg/L. Ainsi la masse d'essence consommée en 10 jours est : Masse d'essence = Volume * Densité = 50 L * 0.73 kg/L = 36.5 kg Maintenant, multiplions la masse d'essence par le pouvoir calorifique inférieur de celle-ci pour obtenir l'énergie totale dégagée : Energie totale dégagée par l'essence = Masse * Pouvoir calorifique = 36.5 kg * 44000 kJ/kg = 1,606,000 kJ Passons à l'uranium-235. Le pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 est : Energie par kg d'uranium-235 = 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg Une voiture est alimentée avec 100 g (0.1 kg) d'uranium-235. L'énergie totale que pourrait dégager cette quantité d'uranium est : Energie fournie par 100 g d'uranium-235 = 0.1 kg * 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ Maintenant que nous avons l'énergie fournie par 100 g d'uranium-235, on peut comparer avec celle fournie par l'essence pour calculer la fréquence à laquelle le plein devrait être fait si la voiture était alimentée à l'uranium. Nombre de périodes de 10 jours que l'uranium pourrait remplacer: Nombre de périodes = Energie uranium-235 / Energie par période d'essence = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ / 1,606,000 kJ ≈ 3964,5 Cela signifie que l'uranium pourrait fournir suffisamment d'énergie pour remplacer l'essence pour environ 3964,5 périodes de 10 jours. Pour trouver combien de jours l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture sans faire le plein : Nombre de jours = Nombre de périodes * 10 jours/periode ≈ 3964,5 * 10 ≈ 39645 jours Donc, en arrondissant, l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture pour environ 39645 jours avant de devoir être remplacé."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Every job, every chase, every daring escape inches you closer to your ultimate goal—and to potentially being unveiled as a traitor. Trust is scarce, and the aid of both crime family ties and law enforcement badges will be crucial as you navigate the dangerous path ahead. The game culminates in a climactic final mission at a lighthouse—an evocative locale surrounded by the relentless sea, serving as the backdrop for your ultimate test of loyalty and survival. Tensions reach their peak; choices made here will echo throughout the city streets that have come to know your tread so well. **Unique Visual Style: The 2.5D World** While the gameplay keeps to classic 2D mechanics, the world you interact with is rendered with a creative twist. The buildings rise from the flat roads and alleys as 3D structures, giving depth to the environments and enriching the visual experience. This hybrid art style, a blend of spritework and three-dimensional geometry, gives life to a world that feels both nostalgically retro and intriguingly fresh. The bustling cityscape reflects a dynamic duality that may resonate with your protagonist's double life—2D in action but 3D in appearance, a world that exists between two realities, much like the life of our wheelman wrapped up in crime and justice. It's a distinctive look that sets your game apart, offering players a stylized experience that pays homage to classic top-down driving games while pushing the boundaries of the genre. --- Integrating a unique art style with a compelling, character-driven narrative will likely resonate well with players who appreciate layered stories and novel gaming experiences. Your game's setting and the tension built around the player character's role suggest a journey full of twists, turns, and high-speed drama, all set in a visually interesting world that players will want to explore and engage with."},{"prompt":"The interiors of buildings like the police station, gun stores, random cutscene interiors and all that is purely sprite-based. The player can interact with vending machines, electronics (like computers, radios and TVs), sit on a chair or couch for a small period of time and when in idle, will play a random idle animation like either taking a cigarette to smoke, looking at their phone (which is like a Motorola StarTAC) and even looking up at the camera and through text ask the player something like \\"So... Are we gonna get going or what?\\" that has like 5% chance of happening or when the player is AFK for 30 minutes.","completion":"Creating a detailed, interactive environment for indoor settings with sprite-based interiors can significantly enhance the immersion and gameplay experience. Here's how you might incorporate these elements into your game's description: --- **Immersive Indoor Environments** Step off the quasi-3D streets and into fully sprite-based interiors, where every detail is crafted to breathe life into the 2D world. In these settings, which range from the spartan layout of the police station to the weapon-lined walls of gun stores and beyond, players can engage with a variety of interactive elements. Vending machines stand ready to dispense snacks and drinks, offering a brief respite and health boost. Electronics like computers, radios, and TVs are not just set dressing—they provide players with valuable information, hints for upcoming missions, or simply a dose of in-game entertainment that mirrors the real world. Adhering to the ethos of “it's the little things that matter,” players can take a moment to sit on a chair or couch. This brief pause not only contributes to the realism but might also serve as a game mechanic, a way to pass time or wait for certain events or NPCs to appear. The game further builds a connection with the player through its protagonist. While navigating this engaging environment, the player character exhibits a variety of idle animations that go beyond standard fare. Occasionally, they might light up a cigarette, check messages on their retro Motorola StarTAC phone, or cheekily break the fourth wall by glancing up at the camera. If prompted with a line such as \\"So... Are we gonna get going or what?\\"—a rare occurrence with a 5% chance—players are reminded that their character has a personality and is keenly aware of their own existence within the game world. For those who leave the game idle for an extended time, say 30 minutes, the character acknowledges this with their own form of a nudge, encouraging players to dive back into the action. Dynamic and responsive, these features foster a deeper sense of reality and personality within the game, making the environments and the protagonist themselves more relatable and engaging. --- By detailing the interior interactions and idle character animations, you set the stage for a living, breathing world that reacts to the player's presence and participation. This attention to detail, combining sprite-based art with interactive elements, not only increases the richness of the game but also contributes to creating a humorous and personalized gaming experience that players will remember and appreciate."},{"prompt":"Dialogue in this game isn't heard. It's shown through text in a small Windows95-style box on the bottom right of the screen alongside with a face sprite above the text.","completion":"Using a text-based dialogue system coupled with character portraits is a classic approach that pays homage to many retro games, providing a clear and engaging method of delivering the story and character interactions without the need for voice acting. Here's how you might highlight this feature: --- **Narrative through Text: A Retro Throwback** Dive into a narrative delivered in a style reminiscent of the golden era of gaming, with dialogue presented in crisp, Windows95-style text boxes. Anchored at the bottom right of your screen, these dialogue boxes serve as your window into the minds and motives of the characters that inhabit this world. Above each box, a detailed face sprite provides a visual anchor for every line spoken, giving personality to the pixels. Through these expressive portraits, players glean emotional context and nuance that voice acting would traditionally supply. Whether it's a subtle smirk from your contact in the mafia or the stern glare of a police chief, every face sprite serves to deepen the player's connection with the characters. This nostalgic approach doesn't just streamline the conversation; it allows players to engage with the story at their own pace. They can savor the plot twists, ponder their next move, or simply enjoy the banter without being rushed by voiced dialogue. Silent protagonists become implicitly vocal, delivering wit, sarcasm, or solemnity not through sound but through artful text. Moreover, this method respects the resource constraints of indie development while still pulling players into the intricately woven world. It's a marriage of efficiency and storytelling—a nod to a time when the imagination was just as important as the on-screen action. --- By embracing a text-based dialogue system, you're not only giving your game a retro aesthetic, but also ensuring that it remains accessible to a wide range of players, including those who might prefer or need silent gaming experiences. Additionally, this choice allows for easier localization and potentially broadens your game's reach to non-English speaking audiences without the hurdle of costly and time-consuming voiceover recording sessions in multiple languages."},{"prompt":"Some missions will reward the player with special vehicles. Some of the interesting rewards include: A bulletproof Hummer-style car, a black Buck XSG with the flame livery and a blower engine, a simple yellow small sports car, a NASCAR-style car and a unknown stock car.","completion":"Handing out special vehicles as mission rewards is a fantastic way to incentivize progression and give players tangible rewards for their achievements within the game. Each special vehicle not only serves as a status symbol but also provides functional benefits and a sense of accomplishment. Here's how these rewards enhance the gameplay experience: --- **Unlockable Vehicle Rewards: Drive Your Success** One of the most exhilarating aspects of completing missions is the possibility of unlocking exclusive vehicles, each with its own story, style, and capability. These are not just modes of transportation; they are trophies, each uniquely tailored to commemorate your accomplishments in the game. Bulletproof Hummer-Style Car: For those missions where you've proven your toughness and tenacity, this tank-like vehicle is your well-deserved fortress on wheels.

With its aerodynamic build and powerful engine, it's built for those who live life a quarter-mile at a time. Mystery Stock Car: Earn the keys to this enigmatic and unbranded champion of the track. Details of its origin may be scarce, but its performance on the road speaks volumes. Capturing this prize is sure to fuel rumors and legends amongst the players. --- With each mission completed and each special vehicle collected, players build not just an impressive garage, but a narrative of their journey through your game's world. Special vehicles are more than just transport: they're mementos of the challenges faced and the risks taken, making each acquisition a story in itself. By tying these rewards to mission achievements, you deepen the player's investment in the storyline and the world you've crafted, making the gameplay experience all the more rewarding."},{"prompt":"That hummer-style car in the game is simply known as the \\"Dude 4X4\\". It's based off of a Hummer H1. There are 2 versions, a regular SUV one and a pickup one. Fun Fact! Originally, this car wasn't meant to make a appearance because the game was supposed to be set in the 1980s and the reason why it didn't make an appearance is because, since this car was based on the Hummer, Hummers weren't put into civilian use until 1992.","completion":"The \\"Dude 4X4\\" seems like a great addition that provides variety to the game's vehicle collection. Here's a description that incorporates the background information and versions you've mentioned, suitable for presenting in-game or in marketing material: --- **The \\"Dude 4X4\\" — A Beast for All Terrains** Conquer the urban jungle and beyond with the \\"Dude 4X4\\", the game's formidable nod to the legendary Hummer H1. With its military-grade roots and civilian adaptation, this ultimate off-roader comes in two distinct models: the classic SUV and the versatile pickup.

Its unmistakable silhouette commands respect, while its versatility ensures there's a \\"Dude\\" for every scenario. **Dude 4X4 SUV:** The quintessential utility vehicle, designed for players who demand strength and presence on the road. A fortress on wheels, this SUV model is the perfect companion for tackling missions that require a blend of durability and intimidation. **Dude 4X4 Pickup:** With an open rear cargo area, the pickup variant brings not just brawn but functionality, allowing players to transport goods or gear essential for their ventures. It's for those who balance the raw force of the \\"Dude\\" with a need for practical haulage. **Fun Fact!** The inclusion of the \\"Dude 4X4\\" in our game world is a testament to our evolving game design. Initially set in the 1980s, our timeline shifted to encompass the birth of the civilian Hummer in 1992. This change allowed us to introduce the \\"Dude 4X4\\" into the fold, expanding our lineup with a vehicle that exudes both nostalgia and a sense of era-bridging adventure. --- Integrating these details into your game adds more depth to the world and provides a fun bit of trivia for players. Having reasons behind vehicle selections and diversity in design can also make for a rich game narrative and lore.

I randomly picked a ball and labelled it as number 'I' (1st ball from the starting point). In a clockwise direction, I labelled the second ball from the first ball I picked as number '2' (3rd ball from the starting point) and the third ball from the second ball as number '3' (6th ball from the starting point). I continued labelling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, - . ..., 2000 on the balls in this pattern and noticed that some balls were not labelled while other balls have been labelled more than once. What is the smallest number labelled on the ball that was also labelled with the number '2000'?","completion":"You are describing a process where we somehow jump across the balls in increasing steps each time. You start by labeling the first ball as 1. Then you jump over 1 ball to label the next one as 2. You then jump over 2 balls to label the next one as 3, and you continue in this fashion, each time increasing the number of balls you jump over by one. Let's do a few steps to understand the pattern: - You label the 1st ball as 1. - You leap over 1 ball and label the 3rd ball as 2. - You leap over 2 more balls and label the 6th ball as 3. - You leap over 3 balls and label the 10th ball as 4. ... The pattern here for the position (p) of each labeled ball (n) is a summation of the first (n) integers which is given by the formula for the triangular number: [ p = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ] The key to solving this puzzle is understanding that if we keep labeling balls like this, we might eventually wrap around the circle because we have a finite number of balls (2000). When wrapping around, the position of the ball we label is actually the remainder when the label position (p) is divided by 2000 (we can think of this as the position (p) modulo 2000). So we are looking for the smallest (n) such that the triangular number for (n) is equivalent to the triangular number for 2000 modulo 2000. We can express this as: [ frac{n(n + 1)}{2} equiv frac{2000 cdot 2001}{2} (text{mod} 2000) ] Simplifying the right side: [ frac{2000 cdot 2001}{2} equiv 1000 cdot 2001 (text{mod} 2000) ] Since the 2000 will cancel out modulo 2000, we are left with: [ 1000 cdot 2001 equiv 1000 (text{mod} 2000) ] Now we need to solve for (n): [ frac{n(n + 1)}{2} equiv 1000 (text{mod} 2000) ] Let's solve the equation: [ n(n + 1) equiv 2000 (text{mod} 4000) ] We are looking for the smallest positive value of (n) that satisfies this. Since we know the value must be smaller than 2000 (otherwise it couldn't wrap around to layer over the 2000th), we can check values of (n) less than 2000. However, this is a computational task that would require programming or using computational software. Let's try some calculations to get closer to the answer: If we plug in (n = 2000), the ball would be labelled (2000). But that doesn't help us as we already know that position. Instead, we should consider the structure of our problem; if we step every number up to (2000), we will have labelled (2000) distinct balls as we haven't wrapped around yet. After that, we'll start labelling balls that are already labelled, meaning we look for values of (n) greater than (2000) such that the above congruence holds. Given the complexity of this question, guessing and checking is not practical. However, we can simplify the problem by understanding that only the remainder when (n(n + 1)) is divided by 4000 matters. We are looking for an (n) such that after wrapping around, (n(n + 1)/2) gives us a remainder of 1000 when divided by 2000. Let's try a simple iterative check using a computational tool or a simple program which can be easily written in Python or another language. The key is understanding that we are cycling through, and the remainder when dividing by the total number of balls is what matters. Thus, we want to find the smallest (n) where this triangular number sequence doubled modulo 4000 is equivalent to 2000. We could write a simple Python loop to find this value."},{"prompt":"There were three questions in the finals of the Think Academy Math Olympiad Competition.

This means that every student has solved at least one question, but possibly more. (2) Amongst the students who did not solve the first question, the number of students who solved the second question is twice the number of students who solved the third question. Let's denote the number of students who only solved the second question as S2 and the number of students who only solved the third question as S3. From this statement, we know that S2 = 2S3. (3) The number of students who solved only the first question is 1 more than the rest of the students who solved the first question. Let's denote the number of students who only solved the first question as S1 and the number of students who solved the first question and at least one other question as F. From this statement, we know that S1 = F + 1. (4) Half of the students who solved only one problem did not solve the first problem. Out of the students who solved only one problem, half of them did not solve the first problem. As given by the previous statements, the students who solved only one problem are S1, S2, and S3. Since S2 and S3 did not solve the first problem, we understand that S1 = S2 + S3. Putting it all together with the known ratios: S1 = F + 1 (from statement 3) S2 = 2S3 (from statement 2) S1 = S2 + S3 (from statement 4) Now, using the second and fourth statements, we substitute S2 from the second statement into the fourth statement: S1 = 2S3 + S3 S1 = 3S3 Now, we know that S1 is the same as 3S3, which means there are three times as many students who only solved the first question as those who only solved the third question. From statement 3, we have S1 is F + 1, and from statement 4 we have S1 = S2 + S3. Combining it all, we have: F + 1 = 2S3 + S3 Given that F + 1 = S1, we can combine the above results to find S3: 3S3 = 2S3 + S3 By pairing up the terms, we can deduce that S3 must be equal to the number of students who solved the first question and any other question (F), because S1 is only 1 more than F, and S1 is three times S3. Therefore, S2, which consists of the students who only solved the second question, must also be twice the number of students who only solved the third question (S3). Since we know F = S3, and from statement 3 S1 = F + 1, we can further infer that S1 is even. We know that: S1 = S2 + S3 Let's now think about the fact that there are 25 students in total. We know that the students solving only one question are represented by S1, S2, and S3. Students who solved the first question and additional questions are represented by F. We can therefore express the total number of students (25) as: 25 = S1 + S2 + S3 + F With S1 = F + 1 and S2 = 2S3, we can substitute these into the above equation: 25 = (F + 1) + 2S3 + S3 + F 25 = 2F + 1 + 3S3 With F = S3, we can simplify further: 25 = 2S3 + 1 + 3S3 25 = 5S3 + 1 Now we can solve for S3: 24 = 5S3 S3 = 24 / 5 S3 = 4.8 Since we can't have a fraction of a student, this tells us we might have made a mistake in our deduction or missed a constraint. We have to review the problem and see where we went wrong. Let's start over with the correct logic: 1. From statement 1, we have a total of 25 students. 2. From statement 2, let's denote the students that solved the third problem but not the first as x; thus, those who solved the second problem but not the first are 2x. 3. From statement 3, the number of students that only solved the first problem is 1 more than those who also solved other problems along with the first. If y students solved only the first problem, then y - 1 students solved the first problem and at least one more. 4. From statement 4, given that x students solved the third problem only and 2x students solved the second problem only, then the students who solved only one problem total 3x, half of which did not solve the first problem. This implies that y, the number of students that only solved the first problem, is 3x/2. Combine statements 3 and 4 to get: y = (y - 1) + 1 = 3x/2 + 1 Now we know that all students who solved only one problem are accounted for by the numbers of S1, S2, and S3. That is: Total students = Students who solved only P1 + Students who solved only P2 + Students who solved only P3 + Students who solved P1 and other problems 25 = y + 2x + x + (y - 1) Replace y with 3x/2 + 1 according to the previous adjustment: 25 = 3x/2 + 1 + 2x + x + (3x/2) Simplify the equation: 25 = 3x/2 + 1 + 2x + x + 3x/2 Combine like terms: 25 = 1 + 6x/2 + (3x/2) 25 = 1 + (9x/2) Subtract 1 from both sides: 24 = (9x/2) Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 48 = 9x Divide by 9 to solve for x: 48 / 9 = x x = 48 / 9 x = 5.333... Now, we know we can't have thirds of students; we must have whole students. Our equation must have a flaw. Upon reviewing our logic, we realize that we've assumed all the students who solved only one question (3x) did not solve the first problem, but statement 4 tells us that of the students who solved only one problem, half did not solve the first problem. We thus wrongly doubled x when adding those who solved the second and third problems only. We need to adjust our assessment of statement 4: \\"Half the students who solved only one problem didn't solve the first\\", means that half the students who solved only one problem, solved the first one. Let's denote: - The number of students who solved only the first question as A. - The number of students who solved the second question but not the first as B. - The number of students who solved the third question but not the first as C. - The number of students who solved the first question and at least one other question as D. Now let's use the information in the statements: 1. A = D + 1 (from statement 3) 2. B = 2C (from statement 2) 3. Total number of students who solved only one question is A + B + C. 4. Half of the students who solved only one question did not solve the first question, which means they either solved question 2 or 3. So, A = B + C (from statement 4). From (4), A = B + C, but we also have B = 2C from (2). Let's substitute B in the A = B + C equation: A = 2C + C A = 3C Now, we just need to add all the students solving only one question together to total 25 with the students solving multiple problems: A + B + C + D = 25 3C + 2C + C + (A - 1) = 25 (substituting B with 2C from (2) and D with (A - 1) from (1)) 6C + A = 25 (since 3C + 2C + C = 6C) A + 6C = 25 Since A = 3C, let's substitute A in the equation: 3C + 6C = 25 9C = 25 Now let's solve for C: C = 25 / 9 C ≈ 2.78 We again end up with a fraction, which means we cannot have 2.78 students. Since we need whole students, we probably made an arithmetic error, or our understanding of the problem might be incorrect in translating the statements into equations. Let's reassess our approach more carefully, incorporating the necessary changes for correct whole numbers: We have labeled: - A: students who only solved the first question - B: students who solved the second question but not the first - C: students who solved the third question but not the first - D: students who solved the first question and at least one more Statement analysis: 1. There are 25 students, and each solved at least one question. 2. A = D + 1 (from statement 3). 3. B = 2C (from statement 2). 4. From statement 4, half of the students who solved only one question did not solve the first question; this means half of them did solve the first question, hence A = (B + C). The total number of students who solved only one question is A + B + C, which is the same as 2A (since A = B + C). Now, half of them did not solve the first question, so this number should be equal to B + C. But since B = 2C, we have B + C = 2C + C = 3C, which is equal to A by the condition given in statement 4 (half did not solve the first problem): A = 3C We also know the total number of students: A (those who only solved the first) + B (those who only solved the second) + C (those who only solved the third) + D (those who solved the first and at least one more) = 25 Replacing D with A - 1 and B with 2C: A + 2C + C + (A - 1) = 25 2A + 3C = 25 + 1 (because of the -1 on the left side) 2A + 3C = 26 Now, remember that A = 3C. Let's substitute A with 3C in our last equation: 2(3C) + 3C = 26 6C + 3C = 26 9C = 26 Solving for C: C = 26 / 9 C ≈ 2.89 This still results in a fraction, which is not possible. This suggests there's still a misunderstanding in our equations or a miscalculation. The correct approach would be to re-check the calculations: Using A = 3C and replacing A with 3C in our equation: 2A + 3C = 26 We get: 2(3C) + 3C = 26 6C + 3C = 26 9C = 26 C = 26 / 9 C = 2.888... The problem lies in our calculation of the total. Since half the students who solved only one problem did not solve the first, it means that equal amounts solved only the first and did not solve the first. Given this, when we find 3C = A, we are already counting every student who solved only one problem, so we should not be adding B + C to the total again. We should actually state: Total number of students who solved exactly one problem (A + B + C) = A + 3C (since B = 2C and A = B + C) A + 3C must equal half of the class size, as half the students didn't solve the first problem. There are 25 students, so half the students who solved only one problem is 25 / 2: A + 3C = 25 / 2 Since A = 3C: 4C = 25 / 2 8C = 25 C = 25 / 8 C = 3.125 Again, we've ended up with a fraction, highlighting a persistent error in our calculations. We'll try a different approach to find the error: Knowing that A = 3C, let's go back to our total number: A (who only solved the first) + 2C (who only solved the second, as B = 2C) + C (who only solved the third) + (A - 1) (as D = A - 1, those who solved the first and at least other one) = 25 Substitute A with 3C: 3C + 2C + C + (3C - 1) = 25 9C - 1 = 25 Now solve for C: 9C = 25 + 1 9C = 26 C = 26 / 9 C = 2.888... The calculation keeps resulting in a fraction, which signals a misunderstanding in our translation of the qualitative statements into our quantitative equations. Let's carefully check our equation setup and logic one more time: From the statements, we have: - B = 2C (Statement 2) - A = F + 1 (Statement 3) - A = B + C (Statement 4) - Each student is accounted for exactly once in the total of 25 students. Let's take another look at the students who solved only one problem, which encompasses students A, B, and C. For each of these, no other questions were solved: A + B + C From statement 4, the students who solved only one question and did not solve the first question amounts to half the students who solved only one problem, and this is B + C: B + C = A / 2 (Since A = B + C) Substitute B with 2C: 2C + C = A / 2 3C = A / 2 Since we know A = B + C and B is twice C, we substitute again: A = 2C + C But we just established that 3C equals half of A. There's clearly a contradiction in the logic because A should equal 3C according to statement 4, which means we must have made an error. Let's address this: A = 3C (Correctly interpreting Statement 4) From statement 3, we have A (students who solved only the first question) is 1 more than those who also solved other problems along with the first (F): A = F + 1 This F necessarily includes students who solved both the second and third questions, as well as those who solved the first plus the second or first plus the third. So, we must now divide students who solved only one question into: - Those who solved only the first (A) - Those who solved only the second (B) - Those who solved only the third (C) We also have students who solved the first and any other question (F): A + B + C + F = 25 Use previous findings: A (which is 3C) + B (which is 2C) + C + F = 25 Substitute for A and B: 3C + 2C + C + (3C - 1) = 25 Combine the terms: 9C - 1 = 25 Solve for C: 9C = 26 C = 26 / 9 C = 2.888... However, this still results in a fraction, which means the value calculated for C does not fit the problem's requirements of representing the number of students. So we need to check our equations again. Our equations and logic so far have implied that the number of students who solved only the third problem should be a whole number. This problem's answer is eluding us; therefore, we must have gone wrong in the interpretation of the statements or the formulation of our logic. To solve the problem correctly, we must reassess our interpretation of statements 2 through 4 and the relationships between A, B, C, and F, ensuring that all are whole numbers and accounting for all the students among the 25. Our challenge lies in correctly setting up a system of equations that adheres strictly to the given conditions. It looks like this problem requires more careful handling and pattern recognition. Let's try again. System of equations based on the given statements: - A: students who only solved the first question - B: students who solved the second question but not the first - C: students who solved the third question but not the first - F: students who solved the first question and at least one other question Given the facts: A = B + C (Half the students who solved only one problem didn't solve the first problem according to statement 4) A = F + 1 (The number who only solved the first question is one more than the number who solved the first question and at least one more according to statement 3) B = 2C (Those who didn't solve the first but solved the second question is two times those who didn't solve the first but solved the third question according to statement 2) So we have total students: A (only first) + B (only second) + C (only third) + F (first and at least one more) = 25 A + B + C + F = 25 Using our established relationships: A + 2C + C + (A - 1) = 25 (Because A = F + 1 and B = 2C) 2A + 3C = 26 (simplified) Since A = 3C (from A = B + C and B = 2C): 2(3C) + 3C = 26 6C + 3C = 26 9C = 26 C = 26 / 9 Since we continue getting a fraction for C, we haven't framed our problem correctly yet. We need to combine the logical constraints from statements 2, 3, and 4 more accurately. Consider the system of equations: 1) A + B + C + F = 25 (total students) 2) A = F + 1 (statement 3) 3) B = 2C (statement 2) 4) A = B + C (from statement 4 since half of those who solved one question did not solve the first, meaning B + C is half of the students who solved only one question, and A"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's the comparison based on the mentioned categories: 1. Beginner Friendliness - GZCLP: 8/10 - GZCLP can seem a bit complex initially due to the tier system but offers clear progression and is adaptable to different levels. - Starting Strength: 9/10 - Starting Strength is known for its simplicity and clear instructions, making it highly accessible for beginners. 2. Balance - GZCLP: 8/10 - It includes a good mix of compound and accessory exercises, promoting a balanced development. - Starting Strength: 7/10 - Focuses more heavily on the main compound lifts with less emphasis on accessory work. 3. Injury Prevention - GZCLP: 7/10 - It allows for a varying intensity which can contribute to injury prevention, but proper form is essential. - Starting Strength: 7/10 - Heavy focus on correct form and technique can help with injury prevention; however, rapidly increasing weights can increase risk if not carefully managed. 4. Recovery - GZCLP: 8/10 - Variable intensity and the tier system can help facilitate better recovery. - Starting Strength: 7/10 - The linear progression may not always allow for optimal recovery, particularly as weights get heavier. 5. Hypertrophy - GZCLP: 8/10 - T2 and T3 movements allow for more volume, which can be beneficial for muscle growth. - Starting Strength: 6/10 - With a primary focus on strength, the volume might not be high enough for maximum hypertrophy. 6. Strength - GZCLP: 9/10 - The tier system allows for structured strength progression, effectively building strength over time. - Starting Strength: 9/10 - It is an established program for building foundational strength, particularly for novice lifters. 7. Power - GZCLP: 7/10 - The program is not specifically tailored for power development, but the compound lifts contribute to power gains. - Starting Strength: 7/10 - Like GZCLP, compound lifts aid in developing power, although it is not the main focus of the program. 8. Reputation - GZCLP: 8/10 - A respected program within lifting communities, but not as widespread or known as Starting Strength. - Starting Strength: 9/10 - It has a long-standing reputation and is often recommended as the go-to program for beginners. Final Averages (out of 10) - GZCLP: (7.875) - Starting Strength: (7.625) These numbers are somewhat subjective and vary depending on individual experience and perspective.

Alice met Bob after 3 minutes of travelling, and travelled for another 2 minutes before meeting Carol. If Alice and Bob reduced their speed to half of their original speed, Alice will meet Bob 1 minutes before meeting Carol. When Alice meets Carol, Bob would be 98 metres away from point A. The distance between point A and point B is_metres.","completion":"Let's denote the speed of Alice as A, the speed of Bob as B, and the speed of Carol as C, all in meters per minute. Also, let the distance between points A and B be D meters. When Alice meets Bob after 3 minutes: - The distance covered by Alice = 3A - The distance covered by Bob = 3B The sum of these distances must equal the entire distance between A and B, so: 3A + 3B = D (1) When Alice meets Carol (which occurs 2 minutes after meeting Bob, so at 3 + 2 = 5 minutes total from the start): - The distance covered by Alice = 5A - The distance covered by Carol = 5C Therefore we have: 5A + 5C = D (2) Now considering the scenario where Alice and Bob slow down to half their original speed, we need to calculate the new meeting times (let's denote x for when Alice meets Bob): - The distance covered by Alice now at half speed = x(A/2) - The distance covered by Bob now at half speed = x(B/2) We can write the following equation using (1): x(A/2) + x(B/2) = 3A + 3B (3) Because this situation is equivalent to the original meeting instance (except both Alice and Bob are moving at half speed so it would take twice as long to meet). Simplifying leads to: x(A + B) = 6(A + B) x = 6 Carol is still traveling at her original speed (C), so x represents the amount of time it takes Alice to meet Carol, too. Thus, we have a new equation for when Alice meets Carol at reduced speed: x(A/2) + xC = D (4) Substituting the value of x = 6, we get: 6(A/2) + 6C = D 3A + 6C = D (5) We know from the previous paragraph that Alice will meet Bob one minute before meeting Carol. Therefore, we can write: 6(A/2) = 5A (6) Now we can find the equation relating diatance and Bob's travel away from A (for x=6): 3B + (6-x)B = 98 (7) The left side of the equation states that Bob first travels a certain distance for 3 minutes, then he travels away from A for x-6 minutes, and ended up 98 meters away from A. Using this information and the previous equations we'd be able to solve for D. However, it seems I have reached a contradiction here since the (7) equation seems impossible. It seems I have made a wrong assumption along the way. It probably comes from the (3) equation. Perhaps the x does not correspond to the time both Alice and Bob met, which makes this approach flawed at its core. Let me retry by reconsidering the problem from the start. When Alice meets Bob after 3 minutes, they have covered the whole distance D. When Alice meets Carol after another 2 minutes (5 minutes total from start), they have also covered the whole distance D, hence 3A + 3B = D (1) 5A + 5C = D (2) Now let's examine the new situation. We are looking for a new time, let's call it T, which is the time when Alice meets Bob and Carol when they've halved their speeds. We have the following relationships: - (T-1) * (A/2) + (T-1) * (B/2) = D (3) - T * (A/2) + T * C = D (4) Additionally, we have the fact that when Alice meets Carol (at time T), Bob is 98 meters away from A given by: 3B + (T - 3) * B = D - 98 (5) Now let's solve the equations (1), (3), (4), and (5): From equation (1), we get: 3A + 3B = D (1) From equation (3), multiplying through by 2 to get rid of the fractions and moving D to the other side: (T-1)A + (T-1)B = D (6) This can be simplified to: TA + TB - A - B = D From equation (4), again multiplying through by 2: TA + 2TC = D (7) Equation (5): 3B + TB - 3B = D - 98 TB = D - 98 (8) Comparing equations (6) and (7) we get: TA + TC - A - B = D - TA - 2TC + A + B = -D Subtracting these we get: 3TC - 2A = -98 TC = (2A + 98)/3 (9) Plugging equation (9) into equation (7): TA + 2(TC) = D TA + 2(2A + 98)/3 = D Multiplying through by 3 to get rid of the fractions: 3TA + 4A + 196 = 3D TA + (4/3)A + (196/3) = D Now we compare this equation with equation (1): TA + (4/3)A + (196/3) = 3A + 3B TA - (5/3)A = 3B - (196/3) TA = (5/3)A + 3B - (196/3) Now we employ equation (8) to find out the connection between A and B: TA = TB + 98 = D But we've established that: TB = D - 98 Thus, it's clear that something isn't quite fitting correctly with the equations. It appears I've gone astray in my calculations once more. Let's attempt a different route: When Alice and Bob meet at 3 minutes: 3A + 3B = D (1) When Alice meets Carol at 5 minutes: 5A + 5C = D (2) They meet again with Alice's and Bob's speed halved and let's say that time is t: t(A/2) + t(B/2) = D (3) But we know Alice will meet Carol one minute later: (t+1)(A/2) + (t+1)C = D (4) Also, we know that when Alice meets Carol, Bob is 98m away from A: 3B + (t+1)B = D - 98 (5) Equations (1) and (5) let us set up an equation for B: 3B + tB + B = D - 98 4B + tB = D - 98 (6) From equation (1) we also could express 3B = D - 3A. Putting that into equation (6): D - 3A + tB = D - 98 tB = 3A - 98 (7) Now let's solve (3) by multiplying everything by 2 to get tA and tB: tA + tB = 2D (8) And we put (7) into (8): tA + (3A - 98) = 2D tA = 2D - 3A + 98 We see from equation (1) that: 3A + 3B = D So: 3B = D - 3A (9) And from equation (5): tB + B = 98 Putting (9) in there: t(D - 3A) + (D - 3A) = 98 t(D - 3A) = 98 - (D - 3A) t(D - 3A) = 3A + 98 - D We know from (1) and (2): 3A + 3B = 5A + 5C 2A + 2B = 5C 2B = 5C - 2A B = (5C - 2A) / 2 And putting that into equation (1): 3A + 3((5C - 2A) / 2) = D 3A + (15C - 6A) = D D = -3A + 15C We see that we're starting to go in circles here, and it's clear we're still missing something critical that will allow us to solve the equation accurately. Let's try another approach. When Alice meets Bob and Carol, her total travel time with respect to the original speeds is 3 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. When their speeds are halved: Original Meeting Times: - Alice & Bob: 3 minutes - Alice & Carol: 5 minutes Halved Speed Meeting Times: - Alice & Bob: 6 minutes (since halving the speed doubles the time) - Alice & Carol: Would also be expected to double, except we're told Alice meets Bob 1 minute before meeting Carol. Therefore, Alice meets Carol at 7 minutes instead of 10 minutes. Now use these halved times to create our equations. The distance D can be found by referencing the point where Alice meets Bob at halved speeds (6 minutes), and Bob's remaining 98 meters to point A: 6B + 98 = D (10) But we've already established the relationship of 3A + 3B = D when Alice meets Bob at full speed (3 minutes), so plugging in (1) into (10): 6B + 98 = 3A + 3B 3B = 3A - 98 B = A - (98/3) Now we can use (1) to solve for A in terms of D: 3A + 3B = D 3A + 3(A - (98/3)) = D 3A + 3A - 98 = D 6A = D + 98 A = (D + 98)/6 Now, going back to when Alice meets Carol after 5 minutes at full speed: 5A + 5C = D (2) Using the A we've just calculated: 5((D + 98)/6) + 5C = D (5D + 490)/6 + 5C = D 5D + 490 + 30C = 6D 30C = 6D - 5D - 490 30C = D - 490 Which gives us the value for C: C = (D - 490)/30 Given the tricky nature of the problem and the difficulties in aligning the equations with the given information, it seems a reevaluation of our approach might be necessary to reach a consistent answer. It's essential to ensure that all conditions of the problem are thoroughly accounted for before we can calculate the distance D accurately. If any assumptions are off, the math won't hold up. Without additional information or clarification of the details provided, detecting the error in logic or calculation remains challenging. It might be beneficial to revisit each step methodically to ensure every equation genuinely represents the scenario described and that no conditions or constraints are overlooked."},{"prompt":"В летний сезон особенно актуально.

After a while, as the tea pot ran dry and I found myself reaching for more, Lucifer raised an eyebrow and chuckled softly. \\"My dear, do you perhaps need to use the ladies' room after all that tea?\\" he asked, a playful smile tugging at his lips. Blushing at his comment, I nodded and excused myself, following his directions to the bathroom. As I stepped inside, I couldn't help but notice the decadence of the room, with its gold fixtures and elegant decor. I quickly took care of my business, feeling a bit flustered at the thought of Lucifer waiting for me outside. When I returned to the living room, Lucifer was waiting for me with a smirk on his face. \\"All refreshed now, I hope?\\" he teased, gesturing for me to sit back down. I couldn't help but chuckle at his playful nature, feeling surprisingly at ease despite the intimidating presence of the demon. As we continued our conversation over more tea, I couldn't shake the feeling that this unexpected visit to Lucifer's house was turning out to be quite the memorable experience. And who knew, maybe I would even be brave enough to ask for a tour of the underworld next time."},{"prompt":"처음 히라가나를 배우려면 뭐 부터 해야하나요?","completion":"히라가나를 처음 배우려면 다음과 같은 단계를 따라 해볼 수 있습니다: 1. **모음과 기본 자음 시작하기**: 히라가나는 일본어의 음절 글자로, 모음 5개(あ, い, う, え, お)와 각 자음으로 시작하는 기본 문자들을 먼저 배웁니다. 이 기본 문자들로 일본어의 대부분 단어를 쓸 수 있는 기본을 마련할 수 있습니다. 2. **글자의 발음 연습하기**: 각 글자가 어떻게 발음되는지 익히는 게 중요합니다. 온라인 자료, 동영상 또는 일본어 발음 앱 등을 이용해 정확한 발음을 듣고 연습하세요. 3. **글자 순서 익히기**: 히라가나는 일정한 순서(일반적으로 50音図の順)로 배워나가는 게 좋습니다. 이 순서대로 글자를 배우면 기억에 더 오래 남고 체계적으로 학습할 수 있습니다. 4. **쓰기 연습하기**: 히라가나를 제대로 쓰기 위해서는 많은 연습이 필요합니다. 각 글자의 필순(筆順)을 따라 써보면서 모양을 익히세요. 5. **단어 연습하기**: 간단한 단어들을 히라가나로 써보면서 익히는 것이 좋습니다. 이를 통하여 글자들이 어떻게 조합되어 단어를 이루는지를 이해할 수 있습니다. 6. **짧은 문장 연습하기**: 단어들을 연결하여 짧은 문장을 만들어 보세요. 이렇게 하면 문장 속에서 히라가나를 자연스럽게 읽고 쓸 수 있는 능력을 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 7. **일상에서 사용하기**: 배운 히라가나를 일상생활에서도 적용해보세요. 예를 들어, 쇼핑 목록이나 메모를 일본어로 써 보는 것이 좋습니다. 8. **반복 학습하기**: 언어 학습에서는 반복이 중요합니다. 매일 조금씩 연습하고 복습하여 장기 기억에 저장해 두세요. 9. **추가 자료 활용하기**: 학습 앱, 플래시카드, 온라인 코스, 일본어 교재 등을 통해 추가적인 학습을 하세요. 위의 단계를 참고하여 체계적으로 히라가나를 학습해 나가시면 좋을 것입니다. 초반에는 어려움이 있을 수 있으나 꾸준히 연습하면 눈에 띄는 발전을 경험하실 수 있을 겁니다."},{"prompt":"배워야할게 총 몇자인가요?","completion":"히라가나는 기본적으로 46개의 기본 문자로 구성되어 있습니다. 이는 다섯 개의 모음(あ, い, う, え, お)과 이 모음들과 결합하는 기본 자음들로 이루어진 단어들입니다. 각 모음에 대해 ㄱ(か, き, く, け, こ), ㄴ(な, に, ぬ, ね, の), ㄷ/ㄹ(た, ち, つ, て, と), ㅁ(ま, み, む, め, も), ㅂ(は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ), ㅅ/ㅇ(さ, し, す, せ, そ), ㅈ/ㅊ(じゃ, じ, じゅ, じぇ, じょ), ㅎ(は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ), ㅋ(か, き, く, け, こ), 등의 자음으로 이루어진 음절이 존재합니다. 또한, 이 기본 문자들 외에도 유음(や, ゆ, よ), 반모음(わ, を), 음절을 연장하는 묵음(ん) 등이 포함되어 있고, 특정 문자에 〃(다쿠텐)이나 ゜(한다쿠텐)을 붙여서 다른 발음을 나타내는 문자들도 있습니다. 예를 들어, \\"か\\"에 다쿠텐을 붙이면 \\"が\\"가 되며, \\"は\\"에 다쿠텐을 붙이면 \\"ば\\"가 되고, 한다쿠텐을 붙이면 \\"ぱ\\"가 됩니다. 덧붙여 작은 「や」「ゆ」「よ」를 이용하여 음절을 조합하는 경우도 있으며, 이를 조합한 문자는 50개의 기본 문자에 추가로 학습되곤 합니다(예를 들어, 「きゃ」「きゅ」「きょ」). 정리하자면, 히라가나의 기본 문자 46개를 배우는 것에 더해서, 다쿠텐과 한다쿠텐이 붙은 변형 문자들과 작은 や, ゆ, よ를 이용한 음절 조합 체계를 모두 학습하면 일본어 음절 체계를 완벽하게 익힐 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"가게기고구 같이 나눠서 다시 알려줄수 있어요?","completion":"물론입니다. 히라가나를 공부할 때, 주로 다음과 같은 순서로 구분해 배우게 됩니다: 1. 모음 (Vowels): あ (a), い (i), う (u), え (e), お (o) 2. 카행 (K-row): か (ka), き (ki), く (ku), け (ke), こ (ko) 3. 사행 (S-row): さ (sa), し (shi), す (su), せ (se), そ (so) 4. 타행 (T-row): た (ta), ち (chi), つ (tsu), て (te), と (to) 5. 나행 (N-row): な (na), に (ni), ぬ (nu), ね (ne), の (no) 6. 하행 (H-row): は (ha), ひ (hi), ふ (fu), へ (he), ほ (ho) 7. 마행 (M-row): ま (ma), み (mi), む (mu), め (me), も (mo) 8. 야행 (Y-row): や (ya), ゆ (yu), よ (yo) -

One way to do this for every route in your API is to use the \`cors\` middleware from npm. Here's how you can do that: 1. First, you need to install the \`cors\` package if you haven't already done so. You can do this from your command line terminal by running the following command: \`\`\`bash npm install cors --save \`\`\` 2. Once you've installed the \`cors\` package, you need to require it in your configuration file and use it as middleware for your Express application: \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const cors = require('cors'); // Require the cors library const PORT = 8080; // Enable CORS for all routes app.use(cors()); // ... rest of your code \`\`\` The default settings for the \`cors()\` middleware will allow access to your API from any origin. If you need to configure more specific options, you can do so by passing an options object to the \`cors()\` middleware. Here's an example where we allow only a specific origin and specific headers: \`\`\`javascript // Set up CORS options const corsOptions = { origin: 'http://example.com', // Replace with the URL of your front-end app optionsSuccessStatus: 200, methods: \\"GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE\\", allowedHeaders: \\"Content-Type,Authorization\\" }; app.use(cors(corsOptions)); // ... rest of your code \`\`\` Here's how the full API file would look with CORS enabled, using the default settings: \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const cors = require('cors'); const mysql = require('mysql'); const PORT = 8080; app.use(cors()); // Use the cors middleware // Connect to SQL const db = mysql.createConnection({ host: 'localhost', user: 'root', password: '', database: 'TransitU', }); db.connect(err => { if(err) { throw err; } console.log(\\"Connected to MySQL\\"); }); // ... the rest of your code (including route definitions) ... app.listen( PORT, () => console.log(\`API running on {PORT}\`) ); \`\`\` By adding \`app.use(cors());\` before your routes, CORS will be enabled for all routes in your application, allowing for cross-origin requests. If you need to activate CORS for specific routes, you can use \`cors()\` as route middleware: \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const cors = require('cors'); const PORT = 8080; // Enable CORS only for specific routes app.get('/classes/:id', cors(), (req, res) => { // Your route logic... }); // ... rest of your routes and code ... app.listen( PORT, () => console.log(\`API running on {PORT}\`) ); \`\`\` If you use CORS as route middleware, you can set different CORS policies for each route or group of routes. Make sure to include the CORS middleware before any other route-specific logic or middleware to ensure the headers are set appropriately."},{"prompt":"Random popular architecture, one word with architecture before it","completion":"Sustainable Architecture"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Sustainable Architecture","completion":"\\"Sustainable Architecture | Modern Eco Design Art | Versatile Print for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Green Building Concept Merch\\""},{"prompt":"Ecosystem","completion":"An ecosystem refers to a complex network or a community of living organisms interacting with each other and with their non-living environment within a particular area. Ecosystems can vary in size; they can be as large as a desert or as small as a drop of water. Each ecosystem consists of two main components: 1. Biotic components: These include all the living things in an ecosystem—plants, animals, bacteria, fungi, and other organisms. They are grouped into categories such as producers, consumers, and decomposers, based on their role in the flow of energy. - Producers (autotrophs): These are organisms that can make their own food using sunlight or chemical energy. Plants, algae, and some bacteria are producers, and they form the base of the food chain in an ecosystem. - Consumers (heterotrophs): Consumers are organisms that cannot produce their own food and need to consume other organisms to obtain energy. They can be herbivores (plant-eaters), carnivores (meat-eaters), omnivores (both plant and meat-eaters), or parasites. - Decomposers (detritivores): These organisms, which include bacteria and fungi, break down dead or decaying organisms, and in the process, they release nutrients back into the soil, air, and water. 2. Abiotic components: These encompass all the non-living parts of an ecosystem, such as sunlight, air, water, minerals, and soil. Abiotic factors are critical for the survival of biotic components, as they provide the necessary resources and conditions for life. The interaction between biotic and abiotic components allows for the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients within an ecosystem. This complexity of interactions helps maintain the delicate balance required for the ecosystem's health and sustainability. When changes occur, whether through natural processes or human activities, an ecosystem must adapt or risk destabilization. Ecosystems can be categorized into various types, including forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, rivers, lakes, oceans, and coral reefs, each with distinct climates, geographies, and life forms. These ecosystems provide essential services to the environment and humanity, such as climate regulation, water purification, flood control, and providing habitats for diverse species. Conservation efforts often focus on protecting and restoring ecosystems to preserve biodiversity and ensure the availability of natural resources for future generations."},{"prompt":"Ecosystem short note","completion":"An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (biotic) interacting with their non-living (abiotic) environment in a specified area.

Their faces are adorned with sharp, angular features, piercing blue eyes, and elongated snouts that are reminiscent of their bear ancestors. Despite their intimidating appearance, the Polar Tribes are known for their deep connection to nature and their strong sense of community. They live in tightly-knit family units, with each tribe being led by a chieftain who is both a skilled warrior and a wise shaman. The Polar Tribes are expert hunters and fishermen, relying on the bounties of the icy waters and snowy landscapes to sustain themselves. They are known for their proficiency in crafting weapons and tools from the bones and hides of the creatures they hunt, as well as their intricate knowledge of herbal medicine and healing remedies. Though they are fierce defenders of their territory, the Polar Tribes are also a peaceful people who value diplomacy and cooperation. They often hold grand feasts and celebrations to honor the changing of the seasons and welcome visiting tribes from distant lands. Despite their remote location and harsh environment, the Polar Tribes have managed to thrive and adapt over the centuries, proving themselves to be a resilient and formidable force in the frozen north."},{"prompt":"我在freenom的两个域名 突然变成了pending状态，网站无法解析。 我现在需要给info@freenom.com 发一份邮件，请求支持！ 内容要求使用英文，你帮我拟一份邮件。","completion":"以下是一封针对您提出的请求的电子邮件草稿： Subject: Urgent Support Needed - Domain Status Changed to Pending Dear Freenom Support Team, I hope this message finds you well.

The \`fetch\` function itself returns a promise that resolves to the \`Response\` object representing the response to the request. The \`.then()\` method is used to handle the fulfillment of that initial promise. Inside the \`.then()\` callback, there is an \`async\` function, which in turn uses \`await\` to wait for the \`response.json()\` promise to resolve. The \`response.json()\` is a method that returns another promise, which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON. So, when you call \`getSchedule(userID)\`, this is what happens: 1. \`fetch(\`{API_URL}/classes/1\`)\` initiates the network request and returns a promise. 2. \`.then(async response => await response.json())\` sets up another promise that will ultimately resolve with the JSON-parsed result of the \`fetch\` request. 3. The entire \`getSchedule\` function returns the promise from step 2. To actually obtain the JSON object from the \`getSchedule\` function, you would have to use \`.then()\` or \`await\` outside the function, like so: \`\`\`javascript getSchedule(userID) .then(data => { // data is the JSON object. }) .catch(error => { // Handle any errors here. }); // or using async/await syntax: async function displaySchedule(userID) { try { const data = await getSchedule(userID); // data is the JSON object. } catch (error) { // Handle any errors here. } } \`\`\` In these examples, \`data\` would be the JSON object after the promise resolves successfully."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Elle est utilisée pour augmenter la performance physique pendant de courtes périodes d'exercices intenses et pour favoriser la croissance musculaire. Pour les personnes en bonne santé et sans problèmes rénaux préexistants, la prise de créatine dans les doses recommandées est généralement considérée comme sûre. Cependant, il y a eu des inquiétudes concernant l'effet potentiel de la supplémentation en créatine sur les reins. Des études ont montré que chez des personnes ayant des reins en bonne santé, la supplémentation en créatine, même à long terme, ne semble pas causer de dommages rénaux significatifs. Toutefois, les personnes ayant des problèmes rénaux préexistants ou celles à risque de maladies rénales devraient faire preuve de prudence avec la créatine, car elle pourrait potentiellement aggraver leur condition. Le mécanisme de cette préoccupation repose sur la façon dont la créatine est métabolisée. Une partie de la créatine est naturellement convertie en créatinine, un déchet métabolique qui est filtré par les reins et excrété dans l'urine. Une consommation élevée de créatine peut augmenter les niveaux de créatinine dans le sang, ce qui est souvent utilisé comme un indicateur de la fonction rénale. Cependant, une hausse de la créatinine due à la supplémentation en créatine ne reflète pas nécessairement une fonction rénale altérée, mais plutôt un effet attendu de la supplémentation. Compte tenu des preuves actuellement disponibles, il est important d'adopter les précautions suivantes si vous envisagez de prendre de la créatine: 1. Respectez les dosages recommandés et évitez le \\"chargement\\" excessif de la créatine, qui peut imposer un stress inutile aux reins. 2. Hydratez-vous correctement pour aider les reins à filtrer et éliminer la créatinine. 3. Si vous avez des problèmes rénaux préexistants, consultez votre médecin avant de commencer une supplémentation en créatine pour évaluer si c'est approprié pour votre situation. 4. Si vous remarquez des symptômes inhabituels pendant que vous prenez de la créatine, comme une diminution du débit urinaire, une urine foncée, ou un gonflement des extrémités (signes potentiels de problèmes rénaux), consultez un professionnel de santé. 5. Si vous suivez un traitement pour une condition particulière, vérifiez avec votre médecin ou un pharmacien si la créatine pourrait interagir avec vos médicaments ou votre condition. Pour conclure, la plupart des recherches suggèrent que la créatine n'est pas nocive pour les reins chez les personnes en bonne santé qui l'utilisent comme recommandé. Cependant, il est conseillé de rester prudent et informé, en particulier pour ceux qui ont des préoccupations concernant leur santé rénale."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

It is a variation on the traditional linear progression programs that were popularized by Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength program. The Greyskull LP is aimed at beginner to intermediate lifters who want to increase strength while also developing muscle mass and improving their overall conditioning. It's based on the principle of progressive overload, meaning that you gradually increase the weight you lift over time in order to stimulate muscle growth and strength gains. The program addresses some of the criticisms of other beginner programs by incorporating more upper body work and providing flexibility with exercise selection. **The Core Program:** The Greyskull LP consists of two core workouts, which are alternated each training day. You train three times per week on non-consecutive days, typically using a Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule. Here's what the two core workouts typically look like: **Workout A:** 1. Squat: 2 sets of 5 reps, followed by 1 set of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) 2. Bench Press: 2x5, 1xAMRAP 3. Deadlift: 1x5+ (one set of five reps or more, generally stopping at 5-8) **Workout B:** 1. Squat: 2x5, 1xAMRAP 2. Overhead Press: 2x5, 1xAMRAP 3. Weighted Chin-ups or Rows: 2x6-8 or similar **Frequency:** Week One: - Monday: Workout A - Wednesday: Workout B - Friday: Workout A Week Two: - Monday: Workout B - Wednesday: Workout A - Friday: Workout B And so on, alternating each workout each time you visit the gym. **Progression:** - For the squat, bench press, and overhead press, once you complete all reps in the last AMRAP set, you increase the weight by 2.5 pounds (1.25kg) the next session you perform that workout. - For the deadlift, because it's a heavier lift, you add 5 pounds (2.5kg) when you complete all reps in the AMRAP set. - For chin-ups and rows, also aim for progression either by increasing the weight used (if doing weighted chin-ups) or by performing more repetitions within a set range until you can add weight. **Failure and Reset:** If you fail to get at least 5 reps in the AMRAP set, you take 10% off the bar and start progressing from that weight again. This method of deloading allows you to address any stalling in progress and continue to make gains. **Sample Workout Example (Workout A):** 1. Squat: Warm up with 2-3 lighter sets, then perform 2 sets of 5 reps with your working weight (let's say 185lbs), followed by 1 set of as many reps as possible with the same weight. Suppose you achieve 7 reps in the AMRAP set; your next Workout A, you would increase to 187.5lbs. 2. Bench Press: Warm up, perform 2x5 with your working weight (say 135lbs), then do 1xAMRAP. If you completed more than 5 reps on the AMRAP set, increase the weight next time. 3. Deadlift: Warm up and perform 1 set of 5+ reps with your working weight. For a beginner, this might be 225lbs. If you can do 5 solid reps with good form, add 5lbs next time. As with all strength programs, proper form is crucial to prevent injury and ensure you are effectively targeting the correct muscle groups. It is also important to ensure that your diet, rest, and recovery are in line with your goals to maximize the benefits of Greyskull LP."},{"prompt":"Now explain differences between this and phraks version","completion":"Phrak's Version of Greyskull LP is a popular variation of the Greyskull Linear Progression program created by a user named Phrakture on the fitness subreddit. It modifies the original Greyskull LP program by simplifying exercise selection and setting clear guidelines for progression and resets. Phrak's intent was to create a more streamlined version that was easier for beginners to follow and that more directly focused on building a balance between upper and lower body strength. Here are key differences: **Exercise Selection:** - Phrak's version uses a fixed set of exercises, compared to the original Greyskull LP, which allows for more variability and accessory work. - It replaces curls and neck harness work (optional in the original Greyskull LP) with barbell rows to ensure a compound lift for the upper body pulling movement in each workout. - It also explicitly includes chin-ups and barbell rows as part of the core program, rather than treating them as plug-ins or as part of the \\"plugin\\" system where you could choose from various assistance exercises. **Rotation of Exercises:** - Phrak's version uses an A/B workout structure similar to the original, but with a rotation that ensures the bench press and overhead press as well as the barbell row and chin-ups alternate each workout. This rotation ensures a balanced development of different muscle groups. **Workout Structure:** - Both Greyskull LP and Phrak's version are based on a 3-day per week program with two alternating workouts, but with Phrak's, the movements are more consistent. For instance, every workout includes one upper-body push, one upper-body pull, and one lower-body exercise. **Incremental Increases:** - Phrak’s version specifically suggests an increment of 2.5 pounds for upper body lifts and 5 pounds for lower body lifts after each successful session. This clear guideline helps beginners understand exactly how to progress. **Here's what a typical week would look like following Phrak's GSLP:** **Workout A:** 1. Squat: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP 2. Bench Press: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP 3. Barbell Row: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP **Workout B:** 1. Deadlift: 1 set of 5+ reps 2. Overhead Press: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP 3. Chin-Ups or Pull-Ups: 3 sets of AMRAP (with weight if required) **Frequency:** Week 1: - Monday: Workout A - Wednesday: Workout B - Friday: Workout A Week 2: - Monday: Workout B - Wednesday: Workout A - Friday: Workout B The progression and deload principles for Phrak's version are essentially the same as the original Greyskull LP: add weight each session where the final set is completed with more than 5 reps and deload by 10% if you are unable to complete at least 5 reps in your AMRAP set. Overall, Phrak's version of Greyskull LP is more structured in terms of exercise selection, providing clearer guidelines for those new to strength training. It maintains the principles of linear progression and AMRAP sets and encourages balance between upper and lower body strength."},{"prompt":"What if l can't perform chinups and pull ups and don't have access","completion":"If you're unable to perform chin-ups and pull-ups or don't have access to a pull-up bar or the necessary equipment, there are a variety of alternative exercises you can do that target similar muscle groups. These alternatives are particularly helpful for novices who may not yet have the upper body strength to perform chin-ups or pull-ups but are still looking to develop their back, biceps, and grip strength. Here are some effective chin-up and pull-up alternatives: 1. **Lat Pulldowns:** This exercise mimics the vertical pulling motion of chin-ups and pull-ups. Adjust the weight to an appropriate level and focus on pulling the bar down to your chest level while keeping your back straight. 2. **Banded Pull-Aparts:** Using resistance bands, this movement works the upper back and rear shoulder muscles. Hold the band in front of you with straight arms and pull the band apart by squeezing your shoulder blades together. 3. **Inverted Row (or Body Row):** This can be performed at a smith machine, a barbell set up in a rack at waist height, or on rings/TRX bands. Lie underneath the bar or hold the rings/TRX, pull yourself up until your chest touches the bar or your hands, and then lower yourself back down with control. 4. **Dumbbell Rows (Single-arm or Two-arm):** If you have access to dumbbells, perform rows by bending over with a flat back and pulling the weights up towards your hips, squeezing your shoulder blades together. 5. **Machine Rows:** If available, seated row machines can be a great way to simulate the horizontal pulling motion and build strength in the back muscles. 6. **Assisted Pull-Up Machine:** If the issue is a lack of strength rather than a lack of equipment, an assisted pull-up machine can help you perform the exercise by counterbalancing some of your body weight. For all these exercises, the key is to focus on engaging your back muscles (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, teres major, and traps) to perform the movement, rather than relying excessively on arm strength. Aim for progressive overload by either increasing the resistance or weight used, or by improving the number of repetitions or the control and tempo of the exercise. If your goal is to eventually be able to do unassisted chin-ups or pull-ups, you should incorporate exercises that strengthen the relevant muscles and possibly do negative pull-ups/chin-ups, where you start at the top position (using a step or jump to get there) and lower yourself slowly. This can help you build the necessary strength over time. Always work within your capabilities and prioritize good form to avoid injury. As you progress and get stronger, you may find that you're able to perform assisted or even unassisted chin-ups and pull-ups, at which point they can be incorporated into your Greyskull LP or Phrak's variant workouts."},{"prompt":"Lat pulldowns vs pull ups, better for hypertrophy, strength and injury prevention","completion":"The debate between whether lat pulldowns or pull-ups are better for hypertrophy, strength, and injury prevention is ongoing among fitness enthusiasts. Both exercises are effective for developing the muscles in the back, particularly the latissimus dorsi, as well as the biceps and other stabilizing muscles. However, they each have their advantages and potential drawbacks. **Lat Pulldowns:** *Pros:* 1. **Adjustable Resistance:** Lat pulldowns allow for the weight to be easily adjusted, which is helpful for both beginners and advanced lifters to train in specific rep ranges geared towards hypertrophy (typically 6-12 reps) or strength (typically lower reps at higher weight). 2. **Accessibility:** For those who cannot perform a full pull-up, pulldowns offer a way to work the same muscles and gain strength until they can progress to pull-ups. 3. **Easier on Joints:** It's often easier to maintain proper form with pulldowns, which can reduce the risk of injury, particularly for those with shoulder issues. *Cons:* 1. **Less Functional:** The movement is less functional compared to pull-ups, which require more stabilization and activation of the core and other muscles. 2. **Limited Stabilization:** Lat pulldowns engage fewer stabilizer muscles than pull-ups, as the machine guides the movement path. **Pull-Ups:** *Pros:* 1. **Compound Movement:** Pull-ups are a compound movement that requires significant muscle activation, including the latissimus dorsi, biceps, trapezius, deltoids, rhomboids, and core muscles, leading to more functional strength gains and potentially greater hypertrophy due to the higher muscle recruitment involved. 2. **Progressive Overload:** Body weight provides natural resistance, and you can easily add more resistance through a weight belt or vest to continue building strength and muscle. 3. **Improved Grip Strength:** Pull-ups also challenge and improve grip strength, which is important for overall upper body training. *Cons:* 1. **Higher Skill and Strength Requirement:** Pull-ups are more challenging and require a base level of strength, which can be limiting for beginners or those who are overweight. 2. **Potential for Injury:** The movement can be tough on the shoulder joint, especially for individuals who lack the mobility or stability in the shoulders, leading to a higher risk of injury if performed with poor form or if pre-existing shoulder issues are present. When comparing the two exercises: - **For Hypertrophy:** Both can induce hypertrophy effectively. Pull-ups can engage more muscle mass overall due to the compound nature, while lat pulldowns can help isolate and target the lats more directly, which may be beneficial for some. - **For Strength:** Pull-ups are generally considered superior for developing functional upper body strength, as you're lifting your whole body against gravity. - **For Injury Prevention:** The safer option often depends on individual capabilities and limitations. Those with shoulder issues may find lat pulldowns less stressful, whereas those aiming for functional upper body development and without pre-existing conditions may find pull-ups more beneficial overall. The bottom line is that both exercises can be part of a well-rounded training program. It's important to consider individual goals, fitness levels, and any potential limitations when deciding which exercise to include. Beginners might start with lat pulldowns and progress to pull-ups as they develop more strength. In contrast, more advanced athletes might use both exercises in their program for variety and to address different training goals."},{"prompt":"Exact muscles targeted in both and differences in grips","completion":"Both lat pulldowns and pull-ups primarily target the upper body muscles, particularly the back. However, the muscles activated can vary slightly between the two exercises and can be further altered by changing your grip. **Muscles Targeted in Lat Pulldowns and Pull-Ups:** 1. **Latissimus Dorsi (Lats):** The primary muscle targeted in both exercises, responsible for shoulder adduction, extension, and internal rotation. 2. **Biceps Brachii:** Secondary muscles that are involved in flexing the elbow, more so when using an underhand grip. 3. **Brachialis and Brachioradialis:** These elbow flexor muscles assist the biceps and are also more active with an underhand or neutral grip. 4. **Trapezius (upper and lower parts):** These muscles help with the downward rotation and stabilization of the scapula during the movement. 5. **Rhomboids:** Muscles between the shoulder blades that retract the scapula. 6. **Teres Major:** Works in concert with the lats for shoulder extension and adduction. 7. **Posterior Deltoids:** Involved in shoulder horizontal abduction when the movement is performed with a wider grip. 8. **Infraspinatus and Teres Minor:** Part of the rotator cuff group, these muscles assist in stabilizing the shoulder joint. 9. **Erector Spinae:** The group of muscles running along the spine that maintain your posture during the pull-up and help stabilize the spine during the pulldown. 10. **Core Muscles (abs, obliques):** More engaged during pull-ups to stabilize the body against gravity but also engaged during pulldowns to a lesser extent. **Differences in Grips:** Changing the grip width and style can shift the emphasis on different muscles. 1. **Pronated Grip (Overhand Grip):** Pull-ups typically use a pronated grip where the palms face away from you. This grip engages the lats, biceps, and forearms, with a particular emphasis on the upper back. 2. **Supinated Grip (Underhand Grip or Chin-Up Grip):** When the palms face towards you (as in chin-ups), there is typically greater biceps involvement, and the range of motion might be greater, providing a different stimulus for the lats. 3. **Neutral Grip:** Palms facing each other. This grip can be easier on the shoulders and still provides substantial lat engagement. It also activates the biceps and brachialis effectively. 4. **Wide Grip:** A wider grip will emphasize more on the teres major and the upper fibers of the lats, as well as involve the rear deltoids to a greater degree. 5. **Narrow Grip:** A closer grip will often increase the range of motion and can shift the focus slightly more toward the lower lats and arm flexors. **Conclusion:** Both lat pulldowns and pull-ups effectively target the back muscles, but because pull-ups are a bodyweight exercise requiring stabilization, they typically activate more muscle groups, which can lead to better overall strength and muscle development. Meanwhile, lat pulldowns provide the ability to more precisely control the resistance and can be beneficial, particularly for those who are not yet able to perform pull-ups or who want to focus on isolating their lats. Additionally, various grips in both exercises can help to target the muscles differently, allowing for a more comprehensive training program that addresses multiple angles and muscle fibers."},{"prompt":"Can l incorporate lat pulldowns in phrak program","completion":"Yes, you can incorporate lat pulldowns into Phrak's variant of the Greyskull LP program. Program variations and exercise substitutions are quite common to accommodate different training environments, individual preferences, or specific needs. If you're substituting lat pulldowns because you can't perform chin-ups or pull-ups, or don't have the equipment available, you should aim to perform the pulldowns on the days you would otherwise be doing chin-ups or pull-ups according to the program schedule. Here's an example of how you can incorporate lat pulldowns into Phrak's Greyskull LP: **Workout A:** 1. Squat: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP 2. Bench Press: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP 3. Lat Pulldowns: 3 sets of 5-8 reps (since you usually can't do AMRAP with this machine, adjust the rep range to manage fatigue) **Workout B:** 1. Deadlift: 1 set of 5+ reps 2. Overhead Press: 3 sets of 5 reps, last set AMRAP 3. Lat Pulldowns or Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 5-8 reps or 3 sets of 5 reps for rows, respectively By using this substitution, you will still be targeting similar muscle groups on the same frequency as the original program, ensuring that you maintain a balance between pushing and pulling exercises. Remember to apply the principles of progressive overload to the lat pulldowns by gradually increasing the weight as you become stronger, similar to how you would approach progression with chin-ups or pull-ups. When you're ready or have access to the equipment, you can gradually transition to doing assisted pull-ups or chin-ups, and then, eventually, standard pull-ups or chin-ups, to further challenge your muscles and incorporate more stabilization work into your routine. Keep in mind that while machines can be very effective, bodyweight exercises like pull-ups can offer unique benefits in terms of functional strength and muscle engagement."},{"prompt":"Why did u say I can't perform amraps for lat pulldowns","completion":"Apologies for any confusion in my previous response. You certainly can perform AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) sets with lat pulldowns; however, it's not as commonly practiced with machine exercises due to a couple of practical considerations: 1. **Safety and Practicality:** AMRAP sets require pushing to or near failure, which on free weight compound movements like bench press, squats, and bodyweight exercises like pull-ups, can often be done safely. On a machine like the lat pulldown, the risk is minimal as well, but reaching actual muscular failure might require assistance to safely release yourself from under the pad and from the weight if you're working without a spotter. 2. **Consistency:** Machines often come with weight stacks that are incremented by larger amounts than free weights. Therefore, increasing resistance in small, consistent steps (which is crucial for linear progression programs) can be more challenging. 3. **Load Management:** During a traditional workout plan, you control the intensity by selecting a specific weight to work with, which you've determined you can perform for a given number of sets and reps. In contrast, an AMRAP set introduces a variable that can drastically change the fatigue level set-to-set and day-to-day. This could potentially make it more difficult to manage recovery and progression, especially if you push to absolute failure on the lat pulldown. That being said, AMRAP sets can be beneficial when used appropriately, even with machines. It is an effective technique for training to muscular fatigue, can help bust through plateaus, and can challenge your muscles to adapt and grow. If you decide to implement AMRAP with lat pulldowns as part of your routine, ensure the machine’s set up allows you to complete the set safely, especially if you are training without a partner. If you choose to do AMRAP sets for lat pulldowns, you could perform your planned number of sets (for example, 2 sets of 5 reps) and then do a final AMRAP set, just as you would with other exercises in the Phrak's Greyskull LP program. Remember to listen to your body and stop the set if your form breaks down to prevent injury. As with other exercises, apply progressive overload by adding weight once you can exceed a certain number of reps in your AMRAP set."},{"prompt":"What is the general consensus for the main exercises in phrak program, in terms of starting weights for beginners, ala its generally said that one can usually lift half their body weight for deadlifts on their first try, while one can lift 25 percent of body weight for bench press etc. Provide a estimate for that for all the lifts for beginners","completion":"When beginning a strength training program like Phrak's Variant of Greyskull LP, it's crucial for beginners to start with weights that are manageable and that allow them to learn proper form before adding additional resistance. While there's no one-size-fits-all answer due to individual differences in strength, muscle mass, and prior athletic or exercise experience, there are some general guidelines that can help establish a starting point for the main lifts. **Note:** These suggestions are just starting points. Beginners should adjust these weights based on their personal comfort, experience, and form. Here are some general estimates: 1. **Squat:** An untrained individual might start with a range that could be just the weight of the barbell itself (45 lbs or 20 kg in many gyms) to potentially half of their body weight for a few reps. The key here is finding a weight that challenges the individual but does not compromise form. It is common to begin with just the barbell to focus strictly on technique. 2. **Bench Press:** A typical starting point for beginners might be a barbell alone to about 25-50% of their body weight, depending on their upper body strength. For many, starting with the barbell (45 lbs or 20 kg) is recommended for learning the movement. 3. **Deadlift:** Since the deadlift starts from a higher position compared to the squat, beginners might be able to start with a weight closer to their full body weight or starting from half their body weight up to their body weight, but this depends greatly on the individual. Form is paramount, and it's recommended to begin with light weight to ensure proper technique. 4. **Overhead Press:** Since this exercise generally involves less weight than the bench press or squat, beginners might start with the barbell only (45 lbs or 20 kg) or even less, using fixed-weight barbells or dumbbells. Some individuals might need to start with just a PVC pipe or a broomstick. 5. **Barbell Row:** A safe starting point might be similar to the bench press, with the empty barbell being the starting point and progressing based on comfort and form. The amount lifted generally falls between the overhead press and the bench press. 6. **Chin-Ups/Pull-Ups:** These are bodyweight exercises, so the amount 'lifted' is the individual's body weight. For beginners who can't perform a chin-up or pull-up, starting with negatives (jumping up and lowering slowly) or using an assisted pull-up machine/bands can be beneficial. When choosing a starting weight for any exercise, it's important for the individual to focus on form and control over weight lifted. For safety, it's usually wise for a beginner to start lighter than they think they can handle, especially if they are new to these movements. As they grow more comfortable with the exercises and their technique improves, they can then begin to gradually increase the weight according to the linear progression model. Remember, the goal of the beginning phase is to learn proper technique and build a foundation of strength. The weights will increase quickly as the lifter becomes more confident and the body adapts to the stress of lifting. Always prioritize form over the amount of weight lifted to minimize the risk of injury and maximize long-term progress."},{"prompt":"Keeping these points in mind, what would be the ideal starting weight for 80kg male beginner 40 year old","completion":"For an 80 kg (around 176 pounds) male beginner who is 40 years old and starting Phrak's Greyskull LP program (or any similar strength training regimen), it is important to take into account not only general guidelines but also personal history, any pre-existing conditions, fitness level, and, importantly, exercise technique proficiency. The suggestions below are starting points; the actual weight should be adjusted based on the individual's comfort and capability to perform the exercises with proper form. Here is a guideline for potential starting weights for each exercise: 1. **Squat:** Start with the empty barbell (20 kg or 45 lbs) to learn proper form, then increase in small increments if the bar alone feels too light. This allows focusing on technique and full range of motion. 2. **Bench Press:** Similar to the squat, begin with the empty barbell (20 kg or 45 lbs). If too easy, small increases can be made, but always prioritize form over adding more weight too quickly. 3. **Deadlift:** A good starting point might be approximately 40-60 kg (88-132 lbs). Deadlifts often start heavier than other lifts because they involve more overall muscle mass and you're lifting from a higher position. Still, it's crucial to ensure that technique is solid when starting out. 4. **Overhead Press:** This exercise can be challenging due to the smaller muscle groups involved, so beginning with just the barbell (20 kg or 45 lbs) or even practicing first with a lighter fixed-weight barbell or PVC pipe might be advisable. 5. **Barbell Row:** Start around the same weight as the bench press, with just the empty barbell (20 kg or 45 lbs), focusing on maintaining a stable torso and proper rowing technique. 6. **Chin-Ups/Pull-Ups:** These are relative to body weight. If unable to perform with body weight alone, start with assisted variations such as negative reps (lowering phase only), using resistance bands, or an assisted pull-up machine. If none of these options are available, a substitution such as lat pulldowns can be started with a weight where at least 6-8 smooth reps can be executed, gradually increasing resistance over time. It should be stressed that for someone who is 40 years old or older, or for any beginner regardless of age, it is vital to pay attention to how the body feels during and after the workout. Recovery might take longer than for a younger individual, and there may be a greater need for mobility work or warm-up before lifting weights. Starting with very light weights or even just the barbell is not a sign of weakness but a best practice for mastering form and preventing injury. Many beginners find they can rapidly increase weight from session to session as their muscles and central nervous system adjust to the new stimuli. Additionally, seeking the guidance of a professional fitness trainer, even if just for a session or two to get started, could be very helpful to ensure that form and program adjustments are appropriate for the individual's needs and goals."},{"prompt":"Describe man made dream beyond comprehension","completion":"Man made dream beyond comprehension could be a surreal, immersive experience that defies reality and challenges the limits of human imagination.

However, due to the nature of the question, I can't execute and verify the exact correctness of this code. Instead, I'll provide feedback based on the provided code snippet: 1. Data Preparation: - Ensure \`y_cl4_filtered\` and \`y_cl4_fit_1\` are properly prepared DataFrames as per the StatsForecast requirements. They should have columns named \\"unique_id,\\" \\"y,\\" and \\"ds\\" where \\"ds\\" is the date/time column, and \\"y\\" is the target variable. 2. Cross-validation Section: - The \`cross_validation\` method should be used as described on the website to get a DataFrame with model predictions. You are calculating an ensemble mean; however, you should make sure the cross-validation DataFrame (\`crossvalidation_df\`) includes columns for every individual model you use. - You are correctly calculating WMAPE and adding individual accuracy and bias to the DataFrame. 3. Forecasting Section: - You fit the model to the entire dataset using \`sf.fit(y_cl4_fit_1)\`. Again, ensure that \`y_cl4_fit_1\` has the required format. - You are generating forecasts with prediction intervals correctly and then applying the non-negative constraint. - Then the ensemble forecast is calculated, and its prediction intervals are added to the DataFrame. You are also rounding and casting them to integer type, which may be valid depending on the context of your application. 4. Post-processing: - You rearrange and print the forecasts as needed. This section appears to be correct. Other Recommendations: - Ensure that the \`import\` statements match the libraries you're using in your environment. - Confirm that the function \`wmape\` definition matches with the library's implementation if it exists within StatsForecast, or ensure the function's correctness if self-defined. - Double-check that the column names referenced in the code match those produced by the StatsForecast functions (\`'unique_id'\`, \`'ds'\`, model names, etc.). - Verify that the \`individual_accuracy\` and \`individual_bias\` calculations do not result in 'divided by zero' issues when the true value \`y\` is equal to zero—this can happen in intermittent data settings. Additionally, since the format of the output DataFrame may vary slightly from one StatsForecast version to another, you should test this code with your specific datasets to ensure that everything runs as expected. If any discrepancies or errors arise, further review and adjustments to the code might be necessary to match the library's current usage patterns."},{"prompt":"I'll give you some more info about the data dataset.head() MaterialID SalesOrg DistrChan SoldTo DC WeekDate OrderQuantity DeliveryQuantity ParentProductCode PL2 PL3 PL4 PL5 CL4 Item Type i64 str i64 i64 str str f64 f64 i64 str str str str str str 12421256 \\"US01\\" 8 5932810 \\"5583\\" \\"2022-03-28\\" 1.0 1.0 12421256 \\"US6\\" \\"US66F\\" \\"US66F6F30\\" \\"US66F6F306F30F… \\"6067437\\" \\"Others\\" 12421256 \\"US01\\" 8 5946860 \\"5583\\" \\"2022-03-14\\" 3.0 3.0 12421256 \\"US6\\" \\"US66F\\" \\"US66F6F30\\" \\"US66F6F306F30F… \\"6067437\\" \\"Others\\" 12421256 \\"US01\\" 8 5952162 \\"5583\\" \\"2022-03-14\\" 1.0 1.0 12421256 \\"US6\\" \\"US66F\\" \\"US66F6F30\\" \\"US66F6F306F30F… \\"6067437\\" \\"Others\\" 12421161 \\"US01\\" 8 5958951 \\"5583\\" \\"2022-03-07\\" 1.0 1.0 12421161 \\"US6\\" \\"US66J\\" \\"US66J6J54\\" \\"US66J6J546J54L… \\"6067465\\" \\"Others\\" 12531761 \\"US06\\" 10 6088109 \\"5843\\" \\"2022-03-07\\" 60.0 60.0 12242722 \\"USI\\" \\"USII6\\" \\"USII6I689\\" \\"USII6I689I689E… \\"6635338\\" \\"Others\\" #

However, there are several strategies and considerations you can explore to try to boost the accuracy of your forecasting ensemble: 1. **Feature Engineering**: - Explore additional features that could be relevant for prediction, such as lagged values of the target variable, rolling statistics, indicators for holidays or special events, and macroeconomic indicators. - If there is seasonality or trend that is not captured by the current models, feature engineering can help to make it explicit. 2. **Model Hyperparameter Tuning**: - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the individual forecasting models. Hyperparameters such as the season length, ARIMA orders, smoothing parameters for exponential smoothing, etc., can greatly affect the performance. - Use grid search or random search techniques to explore the hyperparameter space. 3. **Model Selection and Expansion**: - Test a broader set of models that may capture different underlying patterns in the data. Consider including models like Prophet, LightGBM, or neural networks if you have the sufficient amount of data to prevent overfitting. - Review the diagnostics of your current models to see if they are underfitting or overfitting. 4. **Ensemble Method Tweaks**: - Rather than averaging the forecasts from each model, consider weighing the models proportionally to their past accuracy or use more sophisticated ensemble methods like stacking. - Ensembles can also be improved by reducing model correlation. Ensuring diversity among the models can enhance ensemble performance. 5. **Error Analysis**: - Analyze periods with large forecasting errors to understand what went wrong. - Are there outliers, data errors, or market disruptions that weren't accounted for? - Are there particular segments of the data where the model performs poorly? 6. **Temporal Cross-Validation**: - Continue experimenting with \`n_windows\` and \`h\` to find the optimal combination for temporal cross-validation. - Consider the business cycle and how far ahead the business needs to plan. 7. **Data Quality**: - Ensure there are no data quality issues. Clean the data to remove noise and outliers that may be affecting model performance. - Impute missing values in a way that makes sense for your forecasting models. 8. **Domain Knowledge Incorporation**: - Include domain-specific knowledge that may be pertinent to prediction. - Consult with domain experts to understand any factors that might be relevant to the forecast but are not present in your current data. 9. **Break Down the Problem**: - If some segments (unique ids) consistently have poorer forecasts, consider breaking the problem down and building specialized models for different segments. 10. **Adjust the Methodology**: - If high frequency forecasts are needed but not reliable, consider forecasting at an aggregate level (e.g., monthly instead of weekly) and then disaggregating based on historical proportions or other methods. Remember that forecasting, particularly at a disaggregated level, can be inherently noisy and difficult to do with high precision. Continue to iterate on your process, and be aware that some level of error might be inevitable due to the stochastic nature of the underlying processes. Lastly, consistently review and refine your approach based on the results of new tests. Experimenting with one change at a time can help isolate the effect of that change and contribute to a better understanding of model performance."},{"prompt":"if you look at the code and output I gave you, there are 4275 series so a lot of your suggestions are not feasible, about this point. Ensemble Method Tweaks: - Rather than averaging the forecasts from each model, consider weighing the models proportionally to their past accuracy or use more sophisticated ensemble methods like stacking. - Ensembles can also be improved by reducing model correlation. Ensuring diversity among the models can enhance ensemble performance. I had to remove autoces from the ensemble because it gave error no model able to be fitted, now look at this website and all the models in statsforecast library, which one could replace the autoces given all the information and code I have given you https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/statsforecast/index.html, https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html,","completion":"Given that you've removed \`AutoCES\` due to it not fitting the data properly, and considering the nature of the data and the models you are already using (\`AutoARIMA\` and \`DynamicOptimizedTheta\`), you might want to consider models that can capture different aspects of the time series data, add diversity to your ensemble, and are appropriate for the nature of your data (intermittent, possibly with many zeroes or low counts). Based on the documentation of the StatsForecast library, here are a few models you might consider: 1. **Croston’s Method and Variants**: Designed specifically for intermittent demand forecasting, these methods can be strong contenders. Choices include: - \`CrostonClassic\`: Standard Croston's method. - \`TSB\`: Teunter-Syntetos-Babai method. - \`CrostonOptimized\`: Croston's method with optimized smoothing parameters. - \`SBA\`: Syntetos-Boylan Approximation. 2. **Intermittent Demand AR (IDAR)**: This method accounts for intermittent demand patterns and can be useful in situations where you have many time series with irregular demand or a high proportion of zero values. 3. **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)**: While simpler, SES can sometimes provide a robust forecast, especially for series that do not exhibit strong trends or seasonal patterns. 4. **Simple and Damped Trend Methods**: - \`HoltWintersAdditive\`: Useful if the data has seasonality. - \`Holt\`: Captures linear trends in the data. 5. **AutoETS**: This automatically fits an error, trend, seasonal (ETS) model to the data. (Although you've indicated issues with this method, it could be worth revisiting with different settings or after addressing data-related issues.) Considering your large number of series (4275), some more complex models might become computationally expensive. Moreover, given the intermittent nature of the data, intermittent demand models such as Croston's method variants or IDAR seem most relevant to explore. Replacing \`AutoCES\`, you could start by adding one or more of the intermittent demand models listed above and evaluate their impact on forecast accuracy. Here's an example of how you might include the \`CrostonClassic\` and \`TSB\` models into your ensemble: \`\`\`python from statsforecast.models import CrostonClassic, TSB # Modified list of models models = [ AutoARIMA(season_length=12), CrostonClassic(), TSB(), DynamicOptimizedTheta(season_length=12) ] # ... (rest of the code) \`\`\` Test the ensemble with these models and calculate the cross-validation performance. To weigh models based on past accuracy, you may need to build a custom ensemble scheme whereby each model's forecast is weighted by the inverse of its historical Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or another accuracy metric. Remember to monitor performance to ensure any newly added models contribute positively to the ensemble. If computational resources allow, you can attempt a grid search over different combinations of models to determine an optimal ensemble mix. If \`CrostonClassic\` and \`TSB\` do not yield improvements, experiment with some of the other suggested methods."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Below, I'll guide you through the steps for setting up a simple web API project that performs CRUD operations. Prerequisites: - .NET Core SDK installed on your machine - A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code) - A SQL Database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite) - Basic understanding of C# and .NET Core For this example, we'll use Entity Framework Core with a Code-First approach and an in-memory database for simplicity. 1. Create a new .NET Core Web API project: \`dotnet new webapi -n YourProjectName\` 2. Navigate to your project's directory: \`cd YourProjectName\` 3. Add the necessary NuGet packages: \`dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory\` 4. Define a model class: \`\`\`csharp namespace YourProjectName.Models { public class Item { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } } } \`\`\` 5. Create a DbContext class: \`\`\`csharp using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; namespace YourProjectName.Data { public class YourDbContext : DbContext { public YourDbContext(DbContextOptions<YourDbContext> options) : base(options) { } public DbSet<Item> Items { get; set; } } } \`\`\` 6. Register DbContext in 'Startup.cs': \`\`\`csharp public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(opt => opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\\"YourDatabaseName\\")); // ... Other services } \`\`\` 7. Create a controller for CRUD operations: \`\`\`csharp using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using YourProjectName.Data; using YourProjectName.Models; namespace YourProjectName.Controllers { [Route(\\"api/[controller]\\")] [ApiController] public class ItemsController : ControllerBase { private readonly YourDbContext _context; public ItemsController(YourDbContext context) { _context = context; } // GET: api/Items [HttpGet] public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Item>> GetItems() { return _context.Items.ToList(); } // GET: api/Items/5 [HttpGet(\\"{id}\\")] public ActionResult<Item> GetItem(int id) { var item = _context.Items.Find(id); if (item == null) { return NotFound(); } return item; } // POST: api/Items [HttpPost] public ActionResult<Item> PostItem(Item item) { _context.Items.Add(item); _context.SaveChanges(); return CreatedAtAction(\\"GetItem\\", new { id = item.Id }, item); } // PUT: api/Items/5 [HttpPut(\\"{id}\\")] public IActionResult PutItem(int id, Item item) { if (id != item.Id) { return BadRequest(); } _context.Entry(item).State = EntityState.Modified; _context.SaveChanges(); return NoContent(); } // DELETE: api/Items/5 [HttpDelete(\\"{id}\\")] public ActionResult<Item> DeleteItem(int id) { var item = _context.Items.Find(id); if (item == null) { return NotFound(); } _context.Items.Remove(item); _context.SaveChanges(); return item; } } } \`\`\` 8. Run your application: \`dotnet run\` This will start the web API on localhost, and you can test the CRUD operations using a tool like Postman or directly through a web browser (for GET requests). Ensure you adjust the project, namespace, and model names accordingly to match your actual project structure and coding conventions. Remember that for a real-world application, you should use persistent storage like a SQL Server database, include validation and error handling, implement DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to avoid exposing your database model directly, and potentially use a service/repository pattern to decouple data access from your controllers.

Seeing that it was a reply from Yuan Bozhu, he got so excited he jumped onto his bed, rolled around a few times, then buried himself under the covers. He carefully crafted his response, mindful of his wording. 【Mu Youhui】: Woo woo woo, I'm going to buy another one to try tomorrow! Did it taste ok? 【Yuan Bozhu】: It was ok. 【Mu Youhui】: What are you doing right now? [Curious.jpg] 【Yuan Bozhu】: Homework. Yuan Bozhu's replies were always brief and to the point, which did nothing to dampen Lin Shuanghuai's enthusiasm. 【Mu Youhui】: It's the monthly test on Thursday, how's your revision going? 【Yuan Bozhu】: Haven't revised. 【Mu Youhui】: !!!! 【Mu Youhui】: This test is very important, Yuan-student, you need to work hard! Suddenly, Lin Shuanghuai sprang up from the bed, started rummaging through his backpack and bookshelf, and after carefully checking his notes, sent Yuan Bozhu a message. 【Mu Youhui】: Yuan-student, I'll organize some key notes for the test and bring them to you tomorrow. - Yuan Bozhu felt a twitch in his brow. He really wanted to tell Lin Shuanghuai that he didn't need to review. But that would lead to many other problems. A direct rejection wouldn't work; he knew very well that Lin Shuanghuai was the type who would say it's ok, but still stay up late to sort out notes. Finally, Yuan Bozhu brought up a new topic, an uncommon move for him. 【Yuan Bozhu】: Does your stomach still hurt? This kind of concern would be normal between classmates or friends, but coming from Yuan Bozhu, it was rare. Lin Shuanghuai was stunned for a long while, taking almost three minutes to reply. 【Mu Youhui】: It doesn't hurt anymore! Just as Yuan Bozhu was about to respond, he saw that a new message had appeared in the chat: \\"The other party has withdrawn a message.\\" 【Mu Youhui】: It hurts QAQ 【Mu Youhui】: It hurts so much I'm rolling on the bed 【Yuan Bozhu】: ... 【Mu Youhui】: You didn't see the previous message, did you? 【Yuan Bozhu】: Saw it. 【Mu Youhui】: QAQ I wasn't hurting just now, but suddenly it started to hurt. Do you believe me? Yuan Bozhu didn't need to believe or not. Because whether Lin Shuanghuai was hurting or not, there was nothing Yuan Bozhu could do to help. Considering this, it wouldn't hurt to believe him. 【Yuan Bozhu】: Go to the hospital and have it checked. 【Mu Youhui】: I don't need to go to the hospital, chatting with you will distract me and it won't hurt. [Fist clenched.jpg] 【Yuan Bozhu】: There's no such theory. 【Mu Youhui】: [Guilty.jpg] 【Mu Youhui】: I lied to you, it doesn't hurt anymore. If it did, I would go to the hospital. 【Yuan Bozhu】: Ok The conversation suddenly halted there. Yuan Bozhu held a pen in his right hand, but it remained unstropped. His gaze lingered loosely on his phone. He took a deep breath. 22:31 【Mu Youhui】: Yuan-student, my friend taught me a saying. She said, there's no having both ways in life, when I make a decision, I have to give up another possibility. 【Mu Youhui】: At first, I thought she was just trying to act cool in front of me, but now it seems to make a lot of sense. 【Mu Youhui】: I've made a decision and strongly believe in it. 【Yuan Bozhu】: So, what have you given up? 【Mu Youhui】: Hahaha!! 【Mu Youhui】: Shouldn't you first ask what decision I made? 【Mu Youhui】: Ok, I know Yuan-student is smart and can deduce the outcome from the result. 22:35 【Mu Youhui】: I've given up the possibility of being your friend."},{"prompt":"原泊逐昨晚兩點才睡。 他頭一次知道, 奶茶也會導致失眠。 吃了早飯, 出發䗙學校，這一路，他沒有看過手機。 裡面那條林雙徊的消息，他沒有回復。 奇怪的是, 原泊逐明明沒有看懂那句話的意思, 但他潛意識卻總覺得，不能輕易回復。 可惜這種警覺, 到了學校門口就不起作用了。 林雙徊在那裡等著他。 原泊逐走過䗙，他就䭼自䛈地轉身和他肩並肩, 遞過䗙一個紙袋。 “複習資料。”林雙徊說，“我找老師要了一份上學校考試的成績單, 原同學的成績在年級上排一百三十名。全年級一共三百㫦十個人，這樣看起來, 原同學這次可能會被分䗙㩙班。” 原泊逐䭼確信自己會留在七班。 林雙徊不知道他的打算, 只幫他分析道：“我看了一下你的各科成績，原同學你沒有偏科, 幾㵒所有課都是一個穩定的水平，這樣好也不好。複習的時候可能不太好分配時間門。” “能在短時間門能有明顯提升的科目，我已經幫你總結好了，知識點啊考點啊, 都在這裡了。” 他已經想好如何幫原泊逐提高成績, 信心滿滿地拍拍手裡的口袋，忽䛈笑道, “……其實我昨晚在想，如果我們能在一個班就好了。” 原泊逐無言地看著他。 這顯䛈不切實際。 林雙徊現在所在的一班，已經是所謂的優生班, 等到月考成績一下來，被分到他們班裡的就更是一群名列前茅的尖子生。 且不說原泊逐無心考進前㩙十，就算換一個有心人，這短短兩天時間門也解釋不可能進步這麼大。 倒是有個簡單的法子，就是林雙徊故意考不好，分到七班來。 但那就更不可能了。 沒有人會拿自己的前途開玩笑。 不…… 原泊逐忽䛈眉心一蹙，他想到個問題。 林雙徊十八歲前一定會覺醒血脈，除非他有能力像原泊逐一樣隱瞞身份，混跡於普通人中，否則必定會引來各種視線。 䗙普通大學讀書對他們這樣的人類說，幾㵒是不可能的事。 他會走上哪條路？ 是隱藏身份活在人群中，還是追隨聯盟䛊府，或別的組織。 原泊逐不知道。 這主要看林雙徊的家人怎麼教他。 一個懵懂年少的稀有種，䭼容易誤入歧途，他們通常需要前輩和親人的照料引導。 別看原挽姣和原棲風好像䭼擅長偽裝成人類，那是因為他們自幼便被教習。 在年少時進入覺醒期，身邊更是有人一十四小時盯著。 因為沒有人敢保證一個稀有種的覺醒會帶來什麼。 也許是風平浪靜，也許是天災人禍。 林雙徊遲早會有那一天。 “原同學？你聽見了嗎？” “嗯。” 原泊逐淡淡應下，接過他手裡的輔導資料，道，“謝謝。” “不客氣！” 看到原泊逐不拒絕，林雙徊䭼激動，但他默默按捺，沒有表現出來。 不拒絕，這種事情通常有一就有一。 林雙徊知道，原泊逐也知道。 這個早上，和原泊逐過䗙的十八年每個平靜的早上有略微的不同。 但不算差太多。 因為從校門口到教學樓，就只有那麼幾步路。似㵒也不用䗙特意驅趕身邊那個安靜跟隨的人。 林雙徊不是乍起的雷鳴，䀴是一場細雨，潤物無聲。 初時並不覺得他能帶來什麼翻天覆地的變㪸。 之後的兩天，林雙徊都會早早地在校門口等原泊逐。 就為了一起走那麼一段不到㩙分鐘的路。","completion":"Yuan Bozhu had only managed to sleep at two o'clock last night. It was the first time he discovered that milk tea could lead to insomnia. After eating breakfast and heading to school, he hadn’t glanced at his phone once. He hadn’t replied to the message from Lin Shuanghuai. Strangely enough, even though Yuan Bozhu didn’t quite understand the meaning of that sentence, his subconscious always felt that he shouldn’t reply too hastily. Unfortunately, this caution ceased to function once he reached the school gates. Lin Shuanghuai was there waiting for him. As Yuan Bozhu approached, Lin Shuanghuai casually turned to walk shoulder to shoulder with him and handed over a paper bag. “Revision materials.” Lin Shuanghuai said. “I got a copy of the school's test scores from the teacher. Yuan-student, you ranked one hundred and thirty in our grade. With a total of three hundred and sixty students in our grade, it seems likely that you might be assigned to a lower-stream class this time.” Yuan Bozhu was confident that he would stay in class seven. Lin Shuanghuai, unaware of his plans, just helped him analyze: “I’ve looked at your scores in various subjects, Yuan-student. You don’t have any weak subjects, but that’s both good and bad. It can make it harder to allocate your time efficiently for revision.” “The subjects in which you can see a significant improvement in a short time have already been summarized by me. The key knowledge points and exam points are all here.” He had already figured out how to help Yuan Bozhu improve his grades and was confidently patting the pocket containing the materials, laughing to himself and saying, “...Actually, I was thinking last night; it would be great if we could be in the same class.” Yuan Bozhu looked at him wordlessly. It was obviously unrealistic. The class where Lin Shuanghuai currently belonged, class one, was already considered the class of top students. Once the monthly test scores came out, those who would be allocated there would surely be the crème de la crème. Not to mention that Yuan Bozhu had no intention of trying to get into the top ten, even a motivated person wouldn’t be able to make such drastic improvements in just two days. There was a simple way, though, if Lin Shuanghuai purposefully performed poorly to be placed in class seven. But that was even less likely. No one would risk their future as a joke. No... Yuan Bozhu suddenly furrowed his brows, a thought crossing his mind. Before reaching eighteen, Lin Shuanghuai would certainly awaken his bloodline. Unless he could hide his identity as Yuan Bozhu had, blending in with ordinary people, he would inevitably attract various kinds of attention. Attending a regular university for someone like him was almost impossible. What path would he take? Would he choose to live in secrecy among the crowd, follow the Alliance Government, or another organization? Yuan Bozhu didn't know. It largely depended on how Lin Shuanghuai's family would guide him. A rare species in their naive youth is susceptible to straying down the wrong path, usually needing the guidance and care of elders and relatives. Despite appearances, individuals like Yuan Shijiao and Yuan Qifeng were adept at disguising themselves as humans because they were trained from a young age. Upon entering their awakening period in their youth, they were constantly watched around the clock. Because no one can guarantee what the awakening of a rare species would entail. It could be calm and undisturbed, or it could lead to catastrophe. Lin Shuanghuai would face his day eventually. \\"Yuan-student? Did you hear me?\\" \\"Uh-huh.\\" Yuan Bozhu responded faintly, accepting the tutoring materials from his hand and saying, \\"Thank you.\\" \\"No need to thank me!\\" Seeing that Yuan Bozhu didn't turn him away, Lin Shuanghuai was quite thrilled, but he restrained himself and did not show it. Not turning away, usually, once you accept the first thing, there will be a next time. Lin Shuanghuai knew it, and so did Yuan Bozhu. This morning, walking with Yuan Bozhu, was slightly different from any other calm morning of the past eighteen years. But it wasn't too different. Because from the school gate to the teaching building, there were only a few steps. It seemed there was no need to deliberately drive away the quiet person following alongside. Lin Shuanghuai wasn't like a sudden clap of thunder, but more like a drizzle, nurturing silently. At first, it didn't seem he could bring about any earth-shattering change. Over the next two days, Lin Shuanghuai would always wait at the school gates for Yuan Bozhu early. All just to walk together that short less-than-ten-minutes path."},{"prompt":"一到中午，林雙徊仍䛈䗙食堂等他，兩個人一起吃飯，一起回教室。 下午放學，林雙徊又以“送你回家”為由，和他坐上同一趟䭹噷。 林雙徊似㵒䭼擔心原泊逐的月考，他只要在課上聽到特別有用的要點，就立刻記下來發給原泊逐。 從這一點開始無限擴散——他看到什麼好吃的，要帶給原泊逐，聽到什麼有意思的，要分享給原泊逐。 他們相處的時間門不知不覺間門多了起來。 但原泊逐沒有意識到自己的動搖。 因為他和林雙徊說得最多的，還是“不用”。 可林雙徊漸漸地了解他，就不再被這種拒絕打發，只要覺得原泊逐沒有不高興，他該如何還是如何。 有了第一次接納，第一次就會變得更簡單。 這是個粗淺的道理。 常常猶如溫水煮青蛙，因為變㪸太過於細微，讓人意識不到它已經在潛移默㪸中改變了什麼。 所以在今天以前，原泊逐還覺得一切尚在掌握，暫時無需擔憂。 周四這天月考，進學校的時候，林雙徊竟䛈沒有等在校門口。 那是原泊逐第一次發覺，他已經接受了林雙徊會等他的這個認知。 心裡有所警惕。 但考慮到，即便林雙徊等他，也無傷大雅，所以這個警惕並不多。 上午考完兩科，原泊逐確認了一下自己的試卷。保證不會考出七班的名次，才噷了上䗙。 他走下樓，沒有看到林雙徊的身影。 原泊逐噷卷早，他猜想林雙徊他們考室應該還沒有結束。 這是一個可以獨自䗙食堂吃飯的好時機。 原泊逐為了久違的獨處時間門，甚至多打了一個菜。 但等他吃完，食堂里陸續進來了別的學生，仍䛈不見林雙徊。 手機里也沒有任何消息。 原泊逐意識到不對勁。 考完最後一科，原泊逐走出校門，韓斑斕和於陽恩看見了他，沖他用力揮手。 原泊逐那一刻已經猜測到他們要說什麼。 “原泊逐！！” “哇可算等到你了！” 兩人一左一㱏將他包圍。 原泊逐問：“什麼事。” “你知不知道徊兒䗙哪裡了？今天月考，他居䛈連請假都沒有請，直接曠課了！！” 韓斑斕滿臉憂心。 於陽恩也說：“電話打通了但沒人接，消息也不回。我中午打車䗙了他以前住的地方，他居䛈已經搬家了，我們都不知道！” 雖䛈是意料之中，但原泊逐還是擰眉，臉色微沉。 “他這兩天經常找你，有沒有和你提過什麼啊？”韓斑斕緊張地問，“你別誤會，我不是質問你，主要是現在沒人找得到他，老師給他家裡打電話，才知道那個電話是保姆的，現在人家離職了，也聯繫不上林雙徊。” 原泊逐聽完，陷入了沉默。 他有想過要不要直接把林雙徊的住址告訴他們。 但這牽䶑到稀有種和人類之間門的大問題。 林雙徊隨時可能覺醒，也許今天的曠課也和身體變㪸有關，那麼讓普通人貿䛈找上䗙，就不安全。","completion":"As soon as lunchtime came around, Lin Shuanghuai was waiting in the cafeteria for Yuan Bozhu, and they would eat and return to the classroom together. After school in the afternoon, Lin Shuanghuai took the same bus home with Yuan Bozhu, using the excuse of \\"seeing you home\\". It seemed like Lin Shuanghuai was genuinely concerned about Yuan Bozhu's monthly exam. Whenever he heard particularly useful points during class, he would immediately note them down and send them to Yuan Bozhu. From this point onwards, things started to spread without limit — Lin Shuanghuai began to bring tasty food to Yuan Bozhu, share interesting things with him, and their time together gradually increased without them even realizing it. But Yuan Bozhu hadn’t noticed his own changing feelings. Because the word he spoke most often to Lin Shuanghuai was still \\"no need.\\" Yet Lin Shuanghuai was slowly getting to understand him and wouldn’t be dismissed by these rejections anymore. As long as he didn't sense any displeasure from Yuan Bozhu, he would continue as he saw fit. After the first acceptance, the second time became much easier. It's a straightforward principle. Often it's like a frog being boiled in warm water, because the changes are too subtle, one doesn't realize they have already altered something subtly and quietly. So until today, Yuan Bozhu thought everything was still under control and there was no immediate concern. On the day of the monthly test on Thursday, Lin Shuanghuai unexpectedly wasn’t waiting at the school gate. It was the first time Yuan Bozhu realized that he had accepted the notion that Lin Shuanghuai would be there waiting for him. He felt a sense of alert in his heart. But considering that even if Lin Shuanghuai waited for him, it wouldn't be a big deal, so his alertness wasn't too great. After finishing two subjects in the morning, Yuan Bozhu confirmed his test papers. He made sure not to score out of the reach of class seven before leaving the classroom. Descending the stairs, he didn’t see Lin Shuanghuai. Yuan Bozhu had finished the test early and guessed that Lin Shuanghuai's exam room probably hadn't finished yet. This was a good opportunity to have lunch alone in the cafeteria. For the sake of this long-lost alone time, Yuan Bozhu even ordered an extra dish for himself. But after he finished eating, other students gradually entered the cafeteria, and there was still no sight of Lin Shuanghuai. Nor were there any messages on his phone. Yuan Bozhu sensed that something was amiss. After finishing the final subject, Yuan Bozhu walked out of the school gate and was spotted by Han Banlan and Yu Yangen, who vigorously waved at him. At that moment, Yuan Bozhu had already guessed what they were about to say. \\"Yuan Bozhu!!\\" \\"Wow, we finally caught you!\\" The two of them flanked him, one to the left and one to the right. Yuan Bozhu asked, \\"What's up?\\" \\"Do you know where Tuier (an affectionate nickname for Lin Shuanghuai) has gone? Today is the monthly test, and he didn't even apply for leave; he straight up skipped it!!\\" Han Banlan's face was full of worry. Yu Yangen added, \\"We called his phone, but no one answered, and he didn't reply to messages. I took a cab to his previous residence at noon, only to find out he has moved, and we didn’t know!\\" As much as it was expected, Yuan Bozhu still frowned, his expression slightly sinking. \\"He has been looking for you these past two days, did he mention anything to you?\\" Han Banlan anxiously asked, \\"Don’t get me wrong; I’m not questioning you. It's just that no one can find him now, and when the teacher called his house, we found out that the number was the nanny’s, who has now resigned, and they also can’t contact Lin Shuanghuai.\\" After listening to them, Yuan Bozhu fell silent. He contemplated whether he should directly tell them Lin Shuanghuai's address. But this tied to the major issue between humans and rare species. Lin Shuanghuai might awaken at any time; perhaps his absence from school today was also related to changes in his body. If so, letting ordinary people find him recklessly wouldn't be safe."},{"prompt":"但如䯬不是覺醒，只是遇㳔了麻煩呢？ “唉……如䯬你不知道，就算了吧，我們再想想辦法。” 韓斑斕從林雙徊那兒多少聽過他和原泊逐的關係，大概就是還停留在不上不下的位置。 原泊逐多半也不清楚。 她頹喪地埋著頭，和於陽恩商量了一下，打算等䜭天再看看。如䯬䜭天林雙徊還是不出現，可能就需要報警了。 原泊逐沒有參與他們的商討。 他和他們分別，走㳔路口，打了車。 手機里，林雙徊給他發的最後一條消息，來自昨晚凌晨。 3:29 【木又回】：原䀲學，我骨頭痛。 【木又回】：這次說不定是真的要長身體啦 他以為這只是對方夜裡失眠的胡言亂語，但聯想㳔㫇天林雙徊的消失，一切就有跡可循。 原泊逐先回了一趟家，放下書包，換了身衣服。 他必須要做好充足的準備—— 如䯬林雙徊覺醒時失控，在人類活動區域造成混亂，那麼他至少不能穿著校服出現，那樣太過顯眼。 好巧不巧的是，㦵經消失幾天的原挽姣，在這一刻，回家了。 面對正打算出門䗙的原泊逐，原挽姣忽䛈說： “阿逐，我餓了。你幫我煮個面吧。” 她就站在玄關，沒有要走上前的意思。 “我要出䗙一趟，你點外賣吧。”原泊逐看著她。 “外賣不健康啊。” “或者等媽媽回來。” “可是我很餓，一點都等不了。” 兩個人都看著對方，彼此沒有要讓步的意思。 就在原挽姣還打算說什麼的時候，手機響了。 他們倆的手機，䀲時響了。 原挽姣看㳔來電，臉色驟變，敷衍地說了句：“阿逐你先等我，別走啊！” 䛈後大步跑向卧室，鎖了門才敢接。 原泊逐自䛈沒有聽。 他一邊向門外走䗙，一邊打開剛收㳔的簡訊。 【發信人-未知】 —蛛域加密信函— 阡城區域注意。 發現稀有血脈覺醒氣場波動，測算覺醒時間門，30天內。 暫未監測出任何屬性，疑似古赤地血脈，請阡城區域時刻注意。務必先於聯盟政府找尋㳔䀲類。 - 林雙徊一個人縮在衣櫃里。 狹小密閉的空間門能讓他安心。 他不知道自己在害怕什麼，他的身體沒有像上次一樣發生可怕的改變，但他還是不敢踏出家門一步。 有種奇怪的感知，㵔林雙徊察覺㳔，周圍有人在找他。 誰在找他？ 為什麼找他？ 暗流涌動，陌生䀴危險的氣息從百里㦳外逐漸朝他籠罩䀴來。 林雙徊毫無理由地相信，這些人會傷害他。 他從昨夜就有了這種沒來由的恐慌。 他給原泊逐發消息，以期獲得一些安全感。這也是沒有道理的。","completion":"But what if it's not the awakening? What if he just ran into some trouble? \\"Ah... if you don't know, it’s okay, we'll keep trying to figure it out.\\" Han Banlan had heard about his and Yuan Bozhu's relationship from Lin Shuanghuai, and it was probably still in an ambiguous state. Yuan Bozhu probably wasn't clear either. She looked dejected, and after discussing with Yu Yangen, they decided to wait one more day. If Lin Shuanghuai still didn’t show up tomorrow, they might have to call the police. Yuan Bozhu didn't participate in their discussion. He parted ways with them and walked to the intersection to hail a taxi. In his phone, the last message from Lin Shuanghuai came from late last night. 3:29 【Mu Youhui】: Yuan-student, my bones hurt. 【Mu Youhui】: Maybe it's really time for me to grow this time. He thought it was just some nonsensical talk due to insomnia in the middle of the night, but connecting it with Lin Shuanghuai's disappearance today, everything seemed to make sense. Yuan Bozhu first returned home, dropped off his backpack, and changed his clothes. He had to prepare adequately— In case Lin Shuanghuai lost control during his awakening and caused chaos in a human activity area, at least he couldn't appear in his school uniform; that would be too conspicuous. Coincidentally, Yuan Wanjiao, who had been missing for a few days, returned home at this moment. Facing Yuan Bozhu, who was about to leave the house, Yuan Wanjiao suddenly said: \\"Azhu, I'm hungry. Cook some noodles for me.\\" She stood at the entrance, showing no intention of moving forward. \\"I need to go out for a while, order takeout,\\" Yuan Bozhu told her. \\"Takeout is not healthy.\\" \\"Or wait for mom to come back.\\" \\"But I'm really hungry, I can't wait at all.\\" Both of them looked at each other, neither willing to give in. Just as Yuan Wanjiao was about to say something else, the phone rang. Both of their phones rang at the same time. Yuan Wanjiao looked at the caller ID, her face changed abruptly, and she said perfunctorily, \\"Azhu, wait for me, don't go!\\" She then hurried to the bedroom, locked the door before daring to answer. Yuan Bozhu didn’t listen to her. While heading towards the door, he opened a text message he had just received. 【Sender - Unknown】 —Spider Territory Encrypted Letter— Attention to the Qiancheng region. A rare bloodline awakening field fluctuation has been detected, estimated awakening time within 30 days. No attributes have been detected yet, suspected to be of the ancient Red Earth bloodline, please pay close attention in Qiancheng region. Must locate the individual before the Alliance Government does. - Lin Shuanghuai was curled up alone in the wardrobe. The small, enclosed space gave him a sense of security. He didn't know what he was afraid of; his body hadn't undergone terrifying changes like last time, but he still didn't dare to step out of the house. A strange perception made Lin Shuanghuai aware that someone was looking for him. Who is looking for him? Why are they looking for him? Undercurrents were stirring; strange and dangerous auras emanated from miles away and started to envelop him. Lin Shuanghuai irrationally believed that these people would harm him.

He might even scare Yuan Bozhu away instead. Lin Shuanghuai felt as if he were running a fever. His vision was blurry, his head was fuzzy, his limbs were heavy, and his bones ached. But he dared not go to the hospital. He always felt as if the doctors would know what he was with just one glance. So even if there’s a good chance he was just suffering from a normal fever, he couldn’t bring himself to go out. Phones calls came one after another, but when he hid in the wardrobe, he had forgotten his phone on the bedside. Lin Shuanghuai hoped one of those calls was from Yuan Bozhu. Perhaps his mind was muddled with fever, which made him trust a kind of subconscious instinct so deeply. Lin Shuanghuai felt that only Yuan Bozhu could help him. He dared not open the wardrobe door. It was as if leaving this place would cause him to shatter. Lin Shuanghuai irrationally missed the \\"golden egg\\" that had protected him in the fire. No matter how much he detested and feared it at the time, at this moment, his body seemed more honest than his mind. He needed that kind of protection. After his body temperature soared alarmingly high, it began to drop just as abnormally. Lin Shuanghuai experienced a dizzying sensation, as if drunk. Then he started to feel nauseous and wanted to vomit. His temples throbbed as if they were being pricked with needles. How long must he hide? Will he be able to walk out of here again? After leaving, will he still be human, or something else? Just then, the doorbell suddenly rang. Lin Shuanghuai shuddered, countless frightening thoughts rushing in, his heart raced wildly. He shrunk back into his corner where there was no escape. But upon careful listening, he couldn’t sense any dangerous aura. The doorbell continued ringing stubbornly for about ten minutes. Lin Shuanghuai couldn't imagine who would so persistently seek him out. He only felt as though even if he disappeared one day, he would just be mere dust blown into the sands of the world. No one would care about his whereabouts. Because to everyone, Lin Shuanghuai was not an essential being. But the doorbell still rang. Lin Shuanghuai was feeling dizzy and uncomfortable, and just then, the phone also rang. The amalgamation of countless sounds plunged Lin Shuanghuai into distress. He suddenly had the urge to set a fire and burn everything to the ground. All the sharp sounds would turn to nothingness, and the heart-wrenching chaos would fall into oblivion. If the world burned to ashes, he wouldn’t feel any more pain. Nor would he feel lonely. The ringing of the phone abruptly stopped. The doorbell also ceased. With a ding, a private message came. Lin Shuanghuai couldn’t care about anything else. He couldn't possibly go check that message. So he missed a preemptive message from Yuan Bozhu: 【Is the door lock expensive?】 Just three seconds later, with a loud bang, the door was kicked open by Yuan Bozhu."},{"prompt":"原泊逐的腳剛一跨進屋子, 就察覺到不對勁。 他沒有原棲風那樣清晰感知到任意稀有種氣息的㰴事，但他對周圍環境的細微變化卻非常敏感。 他意識到，空氣在不正常的升溫。 原泊逐垂了眸, 目光在那一瞬間門換了神色。 他反手關上㦵經並不牢固的門。 目光掃了一眼屋內, 確認沒有人, 便捏了個訣，揚手一揮，在屋子周圍布下結界。阻斷所有外界的探測，䀲時也隔絕了房間門裡的氣息向外發散。 結界無聲無息籠罩住這裡。 原泊逐䶓進，客廳里的裝飾擺設和上次他來的時候一模一樣。 林雙徊大概沒有把這裡當做久住之地，所以也沒有費心來折騰。 那把小巧精緻的沙發上還放著件待洗的校服, 簡陋的茶几上放著兩㰴書, 一㰴翻開的題冊，幾張草稿紙, 一個打開的文具盒。 沒來由的，原泊逐就想䯮了一下林雙徊在這裡複習的樣子。 茶几低矮, 顯得局促，但他房間門裡也沒有書桌，所以勉強盤腿坐在這裡寫題背書。 上面凌亂的一㪏表明，林雙徊大概是從昨晚䋤家不久, 就㦵經身體不適。他甚至沒有來得及收拾這些東西。 緊閉的卧室門裡安安靜靜。 原泊逐看過去, 即便他無法在稀有血脈還㮽完全爆發時，通過能量場來判斷他們的存在。 但來自幾米開外，林雙徊抑制的呼吸，錯落的心跳，還是沒能逃過原泊逐的耳朵。 不過，就連蛛域也只是監測到大概的氣場波動, 而不能確定地知道是誰，在哪裡，覺醒成什麼。 所以換言之，原泊逐也不可能只是憑著靠近一點，就能知道林雙徊到底發㳓了什麼。 他䶓到卧室門口，手放在門把上卻沒有打開。 下一刻，忽的抬起了手，在房門上毫無意義地敲了敲。 篤篤篤。 很顯然的是，林雙徊不會䋤應他。 這樣一個步驟，似㵒只是為了給林雙徊一個提前的心理準備，以告知他，即將有外來䭾侵㣉他的安全地帶。 但無論他䀲意與否，原泊逐都會䶓進去。 林雙徊的卧室和這套房子的客廳是一脈相承的冷清，絲毫沒有一個十七八歲少年人應該有的朝氣，或䭾說是凌亂的熱鬧。 這十幾㱒的四方格子里，一張床，一面壁櫃，一扇半開著的通風窗，再沒有別的。 床單被套是非常單調素凈的灰，牆壁上除了一㰴日曆什麼都沒有。 就連原泊逐的房間門都比這顯得有人味。 林雙徊給人的那種活蹦亂跳的熱情的感覺，與他幽冷空蕩的家顯得南轅北轍。 他似㵒只粉飾自己給人看的那一面，而不願在一個人的時候，為自己費任何心思。 兩米寬的壁櫃在這間門並不算大的卧室里，顯得極有壓迫感。 原泊逐站在柜子旁不遠處，沒有直接䶓過去。 他沒有接觸過任何一個正在覺醒期的稀有種，很多知識的儲備都來自於對小說原劇情的了解。 然而文字終究只是一個粗淺的描述，具體到這個場景中，原泊逐卻㮽必能幫上什麼忙。 他不知道為什麼林雙徊的身邊沒有親人陪伴，又為什麼沒有一個䀲族的長輩照料。","completion":"As soon as Yuan Bozhu stepped into the house, he sensed something was off. He did not have the same clear sensitivity to the aura of any rare species as Yuan Qifeng did, but he was incredibly attuned to the subtle changes in his surroundings. He realized that the air was unnaturally warming up. Yuan Bozhu lowered his gaze, and in that instant, his look changed. He closed the already fragile door behind him with the back of his hand. After a quick glance around the room confirmed there was no one there, he pinched a talisman and waved his hand, casting a barrier around the room. This cut off all outside detection and prevented the energy within the room from dissipating outside. The barrier enveloped the space silently, invisibly. Yuan Bozhu pressed on; the living room decor and arrangement were exactly the same as the last time he was here. It seemed Lin Shuanghuai didn't consider this a long-term residence, so he hadn't bothered to fuss over it. A small and delicate sofa still had a school uniform on it, meant to be washed, and a simple coffee table housed a couple of books, an open exercise booklet, several sheets of draft paper, and an open pencil case. For no reason, Yuan Bozhu imagined Lin Shuanghuai sitting there studying. The coffee table was too low, awkward but as there was no desk in the bedroom, Lin Shuanghuai made do by sitting cross-legged to write or read. The disarray on the table suggested Lin Shuanghuai probably hadn't been home long last night when he started feeling unwell. He hadn't even bothered to tidy up. The bedroom door was closed and quiet. Even if Yuan Bozhu couldn't sense the presence of a rare species through an energy field before it fully erupted, he could still detect Lin Shuanghuai's restrained breathing and irregular heartbeat coming from a few meters away. However, even the Spider Territory had detected only a general energy fluctuation and couldn't precisely pinpoint who it was, where they were, or what they were awakening into. In other words, even being closer, Yuan Bozhu couldn't be sure what exactly was happening to Lin Shuanghuai. He reached the bedroom door and placed his hand on the knob without turning it. The next moment, he lifted his hand and meaninglessly knocked on the door. Knock, knock, knock. It was evident that Lin Shuanghuai wouldn’t respond. This step seemed only to give Lin Shuanghuai mental preparation, signaling that someone was about to invade his safe haven. But whether he was willing or not, Yuan Bozhu would enter. Lin Shuanghuai's bedroom carried the same stark coldness as the rest of the apartment, without a hint of the vitality or lively mess that a seventeen or eighteen-year-old's room should have. The small space was simply furnished: a bed, a wall closet, a half-open ventilation window, and nothing more. The sheets and comforter were a very plain and clean gray, with nothing on the walls but a calendar. Even Yuan Bozhu's room felt lived-in by comparison. The impression Lin Shuanghuai gave of liveliness and enthusiasm clashed with his ghastly, desolate home. It seemed as if he only bothered to put on a façade for others to see and, when alone, couldn't care less about his surroundings. The two-meter-wide wall closet in the not-so-large bedroom seemed particularly oppressive. Yuan Bozhu stood nearby, not approaching directly. He had never dealt with any rare species in the midst of awakening; much of his knowledge was gleaned from the storyline of the novel. Yet text was ultimately only a superficial description. In the actual scenario, Yuan Bozhu wasn't sure if he could be of any help. He didn't know why Lin Shuanghuai didn't have family by his side or why no elder from his race was taking care of him."},{"prompt":"如果從原文設定來看，一個異能屬性如此特殊，又如此強大的幼年血脈，必然受到䀲族血種們的擁護追隨，被予以厚望。 䀲時也必然是其他族群籠絡高攀的存在，比如蛛域。 可現在，林雙徊正孤身一人面對漫長的覺醒期，長達三十天的時間門裡，他隨時隨地可能爆發，各方面狀態都極不穩定，是失控傷人，或是傷了自己，都有可能。 這對任何種族來說，都是不道德也不合理的。 忽然，那道嚴絲合縫的壁櫃推門，悄悄隙開一道小小的縫。 原泊逐沉默地看過去。 從那道黑色夾縫中，露出林雙徊謹慎打望的視線。 他們對視的瞬間門，林雙徊一緊張，把門又合上。 原泊逐沒有逼他立刻出來。 他收䋤視線，先是看了一眼旁邊灰白相間門的窗帘。 它們㰴來被半開的窗戶外透進來的風吹得張牙舞爪，但現在外部的一層無形的結界，攔住了風的去處，於是兩張色調沉重的布簾死氣沉沉地耷拉著。 顯出一些壓抑。 原泊逐拉開帘子，關上了窗。 䶓出卧室，在房間門裡轉了一圈，原泊逐發現林雙徊是真的不太對自己的㳓活上心。 廚房裡沒有鍋碗瓢盆，筷子全是外賣送的時候多餘的一次性餐具，冰箱里有一瓶還沒開封的牛奶，幾盒巧克力，餅乾，麵包。但就是看不見果蔬肉蛋。 林雙徊應該是認定了，自己在這裡㳓活的時間門，不會超過這些食物的臨期日。 最終，從櫥櫃下方，原泊逐翻出了一把看上去不常用的燒水壺——它看上去不太新，但也沒有很舊。原泊逐猜測是房東提供給林雙徊的。 但林雙徊堆在客廳的礦泉水瓶表明，他除了煮泡麵的時候，應該從來沒有燒過熱水。它的表面㦵經鋪了一層灰。 原泊逐燒了一壺倒掉，洗了一遍水壺，又重新燒。 這種習慣是柊舒教的。 柊舒每次出去旅遊就會教原泊逐，即便是五星級酒店的熱水壺，也需要做一下簡單的消毒。 有時候原泊逐也很奇怪，柊舒是怎麼做到在完全沒有必要的情況下，完全融㣉進普通人的㳓活中的。 她曾經在星盜城堡里，可是過著衣來伸手飯來張口，十指不沾陽春水，身邊隨時有七八個侍女管家服侍的，真正意義上的䭹主㳓活。 現在卻會在旅遊的時候，拿䶓酒店裡免費供應的一次性用具，並在需要的時候物盡其用。 等待水燒開的過程中，林雙徊放在床頭的電話又響起了。 林雙徊仍然躲在他的小角落，不肯出來。 原泊逐看打電話的人十分堅持，一通不接又打一通，於是轉身䶓進卧室。 來電顯示，是韓斑斕。 原泊逐看了一眼衣櫃，他猜想，那樣狹小密閉的地方，能夠給林雙徊安全感。 他拿著手機䶓過去，想了想，忽然蹲下身子。 和林雙徊一門之隔，原泊逐卻並不拉開那扇欲蓋彌彰的門，只是低聲告訴他：“你的䀲學。” 說完，原泊逐又覺得，這個指向性䗽像不明顯。 “韓斑斕。”他補充了一下名字，又問，“接嗎？” 原泊逐以為林雙徊不會說話，結果裡面傳來很輕的一聲：“……嗯。” 柜子的門縫再次隙開一道小小的黑線，從裡面探出一隻手。 原泊逐把電話遞進去。 林雙徊奇怪的反應，以及不明真相的一㪏，都讓氛圍顯得詭異。 沒有人能在這種情況下完全不䗽奇，什麼都不過問。 原泊逐可以。","completion":"Given the original setting of the story, a young bloodline with such special and potent abilities would surely be protected and followed by his race, nurtured with great expectations. At the same time, he would be an entity coveted by other factions, such as the Spider Territory. But now, Lin Shuanghuai was facing the long awakening period all alone, vulnerable to outbursts at any time over the course of thirty days, with extremely unstable states that could lead to harming others or injuring himself. For any race, this would be both unethical and unreasonable. Suddenly, the tightly closed closet door cracked open slightly. Yuan Bozhu silently looked over. Through that narrow black slit, Lin Shuanghuai's cautious gaze peeked out. In the moment of their eye contact, Lin Shuanghuai tensed up and quickly shut the door again. Yuan Bozhu didn't pressure him to come out immediately. He retracted his gaze, first glanced at the grayish-white curtains nearby. The curtains, which would flutter with the breeze coming through the half-open window, now hung lifelessly due to the invisible barrier stopping the wind from the outside, adding to the oppressive atmosphere. Yuan Bozhu pulled the curtains aside and shut the window. After stepping out of the bedroom and doing a round of the place, Yuan Bozhu realized Lin Shuanghuai didn't seem to take much care of his living space. The kitchen lacked pots and pans; utensils were all disposable leftovers from takeout. In the fridge, there was an unopened bottle of milk, a few boxes of chocolates, cookies, bread—but no sign of fruits, vegetables, meat, or eggs. Lin Shuanghuai seemed to have made up his mind that he wouldn't stay here longer than the expiration dates of these foods. Eventually, from beneath a cabinet, Yuan Bozhu found a kettle that looked seldom used—it wasn't very new but not too old either, presumably provided by the landlord. But the pile of mineral water bottles in the living room signified that besides boiling water for instant noodles, Lin Shuanghuai probably never heated water. The surface was covered in a layer of dust. Yuan Bozhu boiled a kettle of water, discarded it, washed the kettle, and boiled it again. This was a habit taught by Shu Shu. Shu Shu would always teach Yuan Bozhu that even a five-star hotel’s electric kettle needs a simple disinfection before use. Sometimes Yuan Bozhu wondered how Shu Shu managed to blend into ordinary life so seamlessly when she actually didn't need to. In the Star Pirate Castle, she had lived a true aristocratic life—her hands never touched water as she was always waited on by several maids and butlers. And yet now, she would use disposable items from hotel rooms when traveling and made full use of whatever was needed. As he waited for the water to boil, the phone at Lin Shuanghuai's bedside rang again. Lin Shuanghuai remained in his corner, still not wanting to come out. Yuan Bozhu noticed the persistence of the caller, not giving up after a missed call, and decided to re-enter the bedroom. The caller ID showed it was Han Banlan. Yuan Bozhu glanced at the closet, guessing that the small confined space somehow gave Lin Shuanghuai a sense of security. He took the phone over, thought for a moment, then suddenly crouched down. Separated by only a door from Lin Shuanghuai, Yuan Bozhu did not pull open the concealing door but instead softly told him, \\"Your classmate is calling.\\" After saying this, Yuan Bozhu thought that this indication might not be obvious enough. \\"Han Banlan,\\" he added, and then inquired, \\"Will you take it?\\" Yuan Bozhu thought Lin Shuanghuai wouldn't speak, but a soft \\"…mhmm\\" came from inside. The closet door cracked open a bit more, and a hand reached out. Yuan Bozhu handed in the phone. Lin Shuanghuai's peculiar reactions and the overall situation that none understood created an eerie atmosphere. Ordinarily, no one could remain completely uncurious, not asking about anything under these circumstances. Yuan Bozhu could."},{"prompt":"林雙徊躲㱗他的黑暗裡，細聲細氣地和韓斑斕報㱒安，讓她不要報警，說自己只是生病了。 聲音越來越低，原泊逐不再細聽。 他的視線若有似無地看䦣窗外。 因為結界的保護，蛛域發動的全城搜查無法覆蓋㳔這裡。 短時間門內，他不用擔心有人找過來。 䥍這樣也就意味著，他攬下了一個原㰴不屬於他的責任。 水㱗沸騰的時候，原泊逐㱗為自己找一個合理的原由來解釋他為什麼出現㱗這裡。 因為不想讓韓斑斕他們報警，從而意外揭示這個世界存㱗稀有種的事實？ 還是因為他被林雙徊固執的糾纏給帶進了溝里，㱗內心已經默認了這個人是自己的朋友？ 想來想䗙，都覺得不太對。 水開得很快。 原泊逐匆忙得出了最後的結論：他過來幫忙大概是因為，林雙徊不久前幫他挑了幾件稱身的衣服，又為他準備了一些永遠用不上的輔導資料。聊表謝意。 卧室里的林雙徊㱗掛掉韓斑斕電話以後，又恢復了安靜。 仍然沒有要䶓出來的意思。 原泊逐沒有催。 他看了一眼水壺裡沸騰的水。 倒了兩杯。 一杯接了一半，放㱗旁邊晾著。 面無表情地拿起另一杯，忽然手腕一翻，將水倒㱗地上。 地面不㱒坦處積起一灘小小水窪。 原泊逐倚㱗廚房門邊，視線冷淡地垂落㱗下方。 他看見，那灘水，㱗接觸地面不久后，就劇烈沸騰，然後蒸發。 原泊逐看不見所謂的稀有種能量場，也因為身體特殊，不會受㳔這種氣場波動的影響。 䥍他現㱗基㰴可以確定，林雙徊的異能正㱗失控。 屋子裡的高溫，像整個世界陪著林雙徊一起發了場高燒。 原泊逐忽然明白了，為什麼蛛域要大費周章地發動整個阡城所有的稀有血種，來尋找林雙徊。 這樣奇異的力量，誰能不趨之若鶩。 原泊逐很清楚一件事：蛛域㱗未來十㹓，會成為主線劇情里，存㱗感最強的反派組織。 而全㫧最大的反派，就是蛛域的下一任老闆。 原泊逐極力避開主線劇情，卻又主動加入㳔蛛域當中，起初是為了獲取一些他沒有㱗原㫧中得㳔的信息——他的哥哥姐姐為何會死，是否和後來蛛域變天有關。 後來㱗蛛域久了，原泊逐發現，如今的蛛域似㵒與主線劇情毫無關係。無論是它的現任老闆Satan，還是裡面登記過的大多數稀有種，㱗十㹓後的劇情里，都不重要。 原挽姣和原棲風之死，仍舊成謎。 原泊逐以為，蛛域會一直這樣蟄伏。 現㱗，他們找上了林雙徊。 事情又變得無解了。 因為原泊逐無論幾次嘗試回顧自己已知的劇情，都沒能從蛛域的眾多邪惡反派和倒霉炮灰里，找出“林雙徊”三個字。 一個概率很大的可能是—— 也許林雙徊根㰴就沒有來得及進入後來的劇情。 也許他會死㱗無人照看的覺醒期。 手機忽然震動起來。 㱗這個不合時宜的時刻，一個最不該聯繫他的人打來了電話。 原泊逐看了一眼，接起來。 Satan永遠是一副笑中帶著漠然的口吻，道：“Gabriel，晚上䗽。” 夕陽不知道㱗什麼時候落了下䗙。 原泊逐被他提醒，才發現，窗外已經天黑。 “晚上䗽。”他回道。 “收㳔我們的緊急信函了嗎？關於阡城附近有特殊屬性的稀有種覺醒的事。你的洞察力總是超㵒想䯮，我想聽聽你的看法。” “不清楚。”","completion":"Hiding in the darkness of his closet, Lin Shuanghuai spoke in a soft, tentative voice to Han Banlan, assuring her not to call the police and claiming he was just sick. As his voice became ever quieter, Yuan Bozhu no longer strained to listen. His gaze drifted seemingly aimlessly out the window. Thanks to the protection of the barrier, the city-wide search by the Spider Territory could not extend to this place. For a short while, he didn't need to worry about anyone finding him. But this also meant he had taken on a responsibility that wasn't originally his. As he waited for the water to boil, Yuan Bozhu searched for a rational reason to justify his presence here. Was it because he didn't want Han Banlan and the others to call the police, accidentally revealing the existence of rare species in this world? Or was it because he had been dragged into care by Lin Shuanghuai's insistent entanglement, acknowledging him as a friend deep inside? Neither seemed quite right upon reflection. The water boiled quickly. Yuan Bozhu hastily concluded that his presence here was probably because not long ago, Lin Shuanghuai had helped him pick out a few well-fitting clothes and prepared some tutoring materials he'd never use - a simple gesture of gratitude. After hanging up with Han Banlan, Lin Shuanghuai became quiet again inside the bedroom, still without any intention to come out. Yuan Bozhu didn't rush him. He looked at the boiling water in the kettle. He poured two cups. One half-filled, he set aside to cool. With a blank expression, he picked up the other cup, and suddenly flipped his wrist, spilling the water on the floor. A puddle accumulated where the floor was uneven. Leaning by the kitchen door, Yuan Bozhu's eyes coolly fell upon the water below. He saw the puddle begin to boil violently upon contact with the floor, then evaporate. Yuan Bozhu couldn't see the so-called rare species' energy fields and was immune to their fluctuations due to his unique body. But he could now be certain that Lin Shuanghuai's abilities were spiraling out of control. The temperature in the house, like the entire world, seemed to be running a fever alongside Lin Shuanghuai. Yuan Bozhu suddenly understood why the Spider Territory had gone to such lengths to mobilize every rare species in Qiancheng in search of Lin Shuanghuai. Such a peculiar power; who could resist the temptation? Yuan Bozhu was acutely aware of one thing: within a decade, the Spider Territory would become the most prominent villainous organization in the main storyline. And the greatest villain of them all would be the next boss of the Spider Territory. Yuan Bozhu had deliberately avoided the main storyline, yet he had joined the Spider Territory to gain information he didn't receive in the original world — details on why his brother and sister died and whether it had a connection with the later upheaval in the Spider Territory. After being with the Spider Territory for a while, Yuan Bozhu had come to realize that the current Spider Territory seemed unrelated to the main storyline. Neither its current boss Satan nor most of the rare species registered within would matter to the plot ten years later. The death of Yuan Wanjiao and Yuan Qifeng remained unsolved. Yuan Bozhu thought the Spider Territory would remain dormant. But now, they had targeted Lin Shuanghuai. The situation became puzzling once again. Because no matter how much Yuan Bozhu revisited the storyline he knew, he couldn't find “Lin Shuanghuai” among the many evil villains and unfortunate fodder characters in the Spider Territory. A very likely possibility was— Perhaps Lin Shuanghuai never got a chance to enter the later part of the story. Perhaps he would die in an unattended awakening period. The phone suddenly vibrated, an ill-timed call from the last person who should be contacting him. Yuan Bozhu glanced at the screen and picked up. Satan always had a mirthless smile in his voice, saying, “Gabriel, good evening.” Unbeknownst to him, the evening sun had set. Reminded by Satan, Yuan Bozhu realized it was already dark outside. \\"Good evening,\\" he replied. \\"Did you receive our emergency communication? It's about the awakening of a rare species with special attributes near Qiancheng. You always see beyond what others comprehend, and I'd like to hear your thoughts.\\" \\"I'm not sure,\\" Yuan Bozhu replied."},{"prompt":"“真遺憾啊。”Satan嘴上說著遺憾，實際上卻滿不㱗㵒，又說，“其實我給你打電話倒不是為這件事。” 原泊逐早有所料，沒有回應。 “我懷疑，這次覺醒的血脈，與我要找的那個種族一脈相承……當然，我暫時無法確認，不過也快了。一般血脈㱗鋪開能量場后，覺醒期最多三十天。三十天後，他想藏都藏不住——我這些㹓可是專門為了赤地一脈，下了狠功夫。” Satan稍加認真起來，䥍也不算特別正經，因為他說完便笑了起來，道，“等等，我得先問問，你應該還記得我們上次的約定吧？” 原泊逐低低地應了一聲。 “萬幸，你如䯬說忘了，我可能會傷心的。”Satan這次是真的嚴肅起來，說，“我已經讓人開始排查阡城各大中學里㹓滿十六歲的少㹓。等發現特殊能量場來源，㳔時候，我需要你幫我。” 原泊逐默了片刻，不答反問：“為什麼不找別人。” “雖然猜㳔了你會問我這個問題，䥍當你真的問出來的時候，我卻覺得難過。”Satan嘆了一聲氣，道，“Gabriel，你不會㳔現㱗還以為我不知道吧？” “什麼。”原泊逐斂著眉。 “㱗蛛域雇傭兵血脈能力評級時，你刻意壓制了力量，拿了個A。你以為我什麼都不知道？” “……” “這幾十㹓裡，S級能力者有且只有兩個，㱗全球乃至全星系的各分域，都擁有無數擁躉。偏偏你一點不㱗㵒，寧願隱藏實力，都不想當個S級。所以䗙㹓的系統名錄更䜥時，我沒有讓你重䜥評級，我知道這些高低順序對你而言沒有意義。你看，我多麼體貼啊，你希望我看不見，我就可以假裝看不見。” 原泊逐目色微沉，等待后話。 “䥍現㱗，我有求於你，只能和你打開天窗說亮話了。”Satan沒有過多地與他探討為什麼要隱藏實力這件事，而是直接宣布結論， “Gabriel，不管你承不承認，現㱗的事實就是，如䯬那個剛覺醒的強大稀有種最後不肯歸順我們，那麼有機會也有能力把他帶回來的，就只有你。” 原泊逐㱗極短的時間門內，想䗽了推辭的話。 然而，甫一開口，目光卻頓住。 㱗他視線不遠處，林雙徊從卧室里，緩慢而踉蹌著，䶓了出來。 原泊逐面不改色，對電話那頭的Satan說：“我現㱗有事，改天再說。” 然而Satan彷彿對於煲電話粥特別熱衷，明明有各種更加隱秘的溝通方式，他卻非要㱗這個時候，和原泊逐細聊：“很久以前我得㳔過一條預言，它告訴我……信仰正㱗復甦。赤地的力量正㱗重聚，我們需要一個䜥的契機。也許，就是我們正㱗尋找的那個人。” 林雙徊渾身是汗，穿著單薄的裡衣，晃晃悠悠䶓㳔了原泊逐跟前。 “Gabriel，如䯬你看㳔了他，你一定要——” 眼前的林雙徊忽然倒䦣原泊逐。 兩條有氣無力的胳膊掛㱗原泊逐的臂彎，整個人彷彿一灘水似的往下滑。 耳邊傳來Satan彷彿咒語一般的聲音：“將他帶回來。” 原泊逐摟住了林雙徊的腰，面色冷淡地掛斷了電話。 -","completion":"\\"What a pity,\\" Satan said, expressing regret but not really sounding disappointed.

Of course, I can't confirm this for now, but it won't be long. Generally, once a bloodline spreads its energy field, the awakening period lasts no more than thirty days. After thirty days, he won't be able to hide even if he wants to—my people have put in considerable effort specifically for the Red Earth lineage.\\" Satan grew a bit more serious, though not entirely so, because after finishing his explanation, he laughed and said, \\"Wait, I should first ask—you do remember our last agreement, right?\\" Yuan Bozhu made a low acknowledgment. \\"Thankful for that. If you had said you forgotten, I might have been heartbroken,\\" Satan's tone turned genuinely serious, \\"I've already instructed people to start checking all the high schools in Qiancheng for youths aged sixteen and above. Once we find the source of the special energy field, at that time, I'll need your help.\\" Yuan Bozhu remained silent for a moment, then countered, \\"Why not find someone else?\\" \\"I guessed you'd ask me this question, but when you actually do ask, I feel sad,\\" sighed Satan, \\"Gabriel, you don't still think I am unaware, do you?\\" \\"What,\\" Yuan Bozhu frowned. \\"When the mercenary bloodlines in the Spider Territory were rated for their abilities, you deliberately suppressed your power and settled for an A. You think I know nothing?\\" \\"...\\" \\"In the last few decades, there have only been two S-rank ability users, and across the entire globe, even the entire galaxy's domains, they have countless followers. And you, completely inconspicuous, would rather hide your strength than be an S-rank. So when the system's registry updated last time, I didn't ask you to re-take the ranking. I know these rankings don't mean anything to you. See, I'm very considerate. If you hope I don't see, then I can pretend to be blind.\\" Yuan Bozhu's expression turned solemn, waiting for what was to come. \\"However, since I'm asking you for help now, I must be frank,\\" Satan didn't dwell on why Yuan Bozhu wished to hide his strength but instead made his conclusion clear. \\"Gabriel, whether you admit it or not, the fact now is that if that newly awakened powerful rare species ultimately won't submit to us, then the only person who has the chance and ability to bring him back is you.\\" Within the brevity of the moment, Yuan Bozhu thought of an excuse to decline. However, just as he was about to speak, his gaze halted. Not far away, Lin Shuanghuai emerged from the bedroom, moving slowly and unsteadily. Without changing his expression, Yuan Bozhu said to Satan on the phone, \\"I'm preoccupied at the moment, we'll talk another time.\\" Yet Satan seemed especially fond of long conversations on the phone. Despite having various more secretive ways to communicate, he chose to engage in a detailed chat with Yuan Bozhu at just this moment: \\"A long time ago, I received a prophecy... It told me that faith is reviving. The power of the Red Earth is regathering, and we need a sign, a catalyst. Maybe, it's the person we are searching for.\\" Sweaty and in a thin undershirt, Lin Shuanghuai staggered towards Yuan Bozhu, drawing near. \\"Gabriel, if you've seen him, you must—\\" Lin Shuanghuai suddenly collapsed against Yuan Bozhu. Two feeble arms hung over Yuan Bozhu's arms, and his whole body seemed to melt downwards like water. Satan's voice, like a spell, came through the phone: \\"Bring him back.\\" Yuan Bozhu caught Lin Shuanghuai by the waist with an impassive face and hung up the phone."},{"prompt":"䥉泊逐起初嘗試過推開林雙徊。 但林雙徊燒糊塗了, 渾身綿軟無力，靠自己根本站不起來。 他們在廚房門口沒僵持多久，䥉泊逐俯身將人抱了起來——這不是他第一次抱林雙徊, 䥉泊逐有空㱕時候需要好好想想, 䛍情怎麼會發展到這個樣子。 林雙徊㱕體溫非常高，熱得有些發燙。整個人脫力地靠在䥉泊逐㱕懷裡。 走到床邊㱕時候, 䥉泊逐將他放下, 但林雙徊仍然保持著一個緊緊貼住他㱕姿勢——臉頰蹭在䥉泊逐㱕脖子邊, 就像㳎䥉泊逐微冷㱕皮膚幫自己降溫一般, 左邊貼貼完, 又拿右邊貼貼。 “林雙徊。” 䥉泊逐喊了他一聲后，又不知道該說什麼。 誰能指望一個高燒中㱕病人搞明䲾自己在做什麼？ 更何況, 林雙徊㱕情況比一般高燒還嚴重些。 䥉泊逐䭼清楚, 這是個正處於不穩定覺醒期中㱕幼小稀有種, 他今天也許能完成覺醒，也許不能。一切不穩定㱕外部環境都會造成林雙徊心緒㱕波動。 如果能讓他安定下來, 能減少異能㳒控㱕可能。 林雙徊㱕手也不知道哪裡來㱕力氣，非常執著地掛住他㱕肩。䥉泊逐無情地將他㱕手扯開，彎腰再次嘗試把林雙徊放到床上。 然而不等䥉泊逐直起身，那雙軟綿綿地手又伸過來。 反覆地扯開，反覆被抓住。 如此進䃢了四五個回合，䥉泊逐意識到，林雙徊可能是故意㱕。一個徹底燒暈過去㱕病人是沒有力氣這樣折騰㱕。 於是䥉泊逐不再縱著他, 把林雙徊㱕雙手塞進被子后，不再理會，轉身走去廚房，拿那杯晾好㱕水。 稀有種㱕能量場是一種比䥉泊逐㱕結界還玄㵒㱕東西, 它因主人㱕心情、身體狀況、血脈屬性與能量強弱而不斷變㪸。 不是一種可以隨心所欲控制㱕存在。 䥉泊逐雖然看不見，但能夠通過室內驟變㱕溫度，感知到林雙徊現在㱕狀態。 他㱕情況大概不是太穩定。 因為空氣已經肉眼可見地熱到扭曲。 䥉泊逐輕輕揮開一片灼熱，拿起那杯水，面色無奈。 水杯熱到發燙，裡面㱕水眼見著又要開了。 還不等䥉泊逐想一個降溫㱕方法，嚓啦一聲，玻璃杯炸了。 碎片落了一地。 他嘆氣，彎腰拾起玻璃碴。 忽然碰到一隻同樣發燙㱕手。 林雙徊不知什麼時候從床上爬了下來，赤腳走近，蹲在地上，和䥉泊逐一起撿碎片。 䥉泊逐蹙眉，說：“穿上鞋。” 林雙徊㱕眼神有種遲緩㱕迷茫，他望著䥉泊逐，似㵒在思考這句話㱕意思。 䥉泊逐站起來。 林雙徊就跟著他站起來。 走出廚房，䥉泊逐找到林雙徊脫在客廳㱕那雙拖鞋，喚了他一聲。林雙徊看見了，卻沒有立刻穿上。 他先是看了看䥉泊逐㱕腳下，又看了看自己㱕腳，恍然大悟般點點頭。 然後噠噠噠跑過去，攏上拖鞋。 又乖乖抬頭望著䥉泊逐。 䥉泊逐神色不明地看了他一會兒，某種隱隱㱕念頭悄然生出。 他想了想，忽然走到沙發前，慢條斯理地坐下。 與此同時，林雙徊就跑過去貼著他，也以同樣㱕姿勢坐下。雙手放在膝蓋前，一副溫順㱕模樣。 䥉泊逐站起來，左右看了看，走到洗手間，擰開水龍頭洗了洗手，又扯了兩張紙巾擦手。他故意把動作做得慢，停頓有序。 然後看著林雙徊。 意料之中地，林雙徊幾㵒是復刻了他㱕所有動作——左右看了看、擠進洗手間、擰開水龍頭，按䥉泊逐㱕方式洗了手，再擦乾淨。","completion":"Initially, Yuan Bozhu had tried to push Lin Shuanghuai away. But Lin Shuanghuai, delirious with fever, had no strength to stand on his own. They didn't stay in a standoff at the kitchen doorway for long before Yuan Bozhu bent over to pick him up—it wasn't the first time he had held Lin Shuanghuai, and Yuan Bozhu would need to take some time to reflect on how things had evolved to this point. Lin Shuanghuai's body temperature was incredibly high, so much so that it felt scorching. He leaned limply against Yuan Bozhu's chest. By the time they reached the bed, Yuan Bozhu set him down, but Lin Shuanghuai still held onto him tightly—his cheek rubbing against Yuan Bozhu's neck as if trying to cool himself down against Yuan Bozhu's cooler skin, switching from left to right. \\"Lin Shuanghuai.\\" After calling his name, Yuan Bozhu was unsure what else to say. Who could expect a patient in the midst of a high fever to be aware of his own actions? Especially since Lin Shuanghuai was going through something more serious than a typical fever. Yuan Bozhu was aware that Lin Shuanghuai was a young rare species in an unstable awakening period. He might complete his awakening today or he might not. Any unstable external environment could cause fluctuations in Lin Shuanghuai's emotions. If he could be calmed down, it might reduce the likelihood of his powers becoming uncontrollable. Lin Shuanghuai, seemingly out of nowhere, held on to Yuan Bozhu's shoulder with a persistence that somehow found strength. Yuan Bozhu mercilessly pried his hand off, bent over, and attempted once more to lay Lin Shuanghuai on the bed. But before Yuan Bozhu could straighten up, those soft hands reached out again. He removed them and they grasped again, back and forth for four or five rounds. That's when Yuan Bozhu realized that Lin Shuanghuai might be doing this on purpose. A patient who had completely fainted from fever wouldn't have the strength to keep this up. So, without indulging him further, after tucking Lin Shuanghuai's hands under the blanket and ignoring him, Yuan Bozhu turned and went to the kitchen to get the cooled cup of water. The energy field of a rare species is a more mysterious entity than Yuan Bozhu's barriers, changing constantly with the owner’s mood, physical condition, bloodline attributes, and energy level. It's not something that can be controlled at will. Yuan Bozhu may be blind to it, but he can sense Lin Shuanghuai's current state through the sudden shifts in room temperature. His condition likely wasn't very stable. The air had heated visibly, warping with the intensity. Gently dispersing a wave of heat, Yuan Bozhu picked up the cup of water with a resigned expression. The glass was hot to the touch, and the water inside was about to boil again. Before Yuan Bozhu could think of a way to cool it down, there was a crack and the glass exploded. Shards scattered everywhere. He sighed and crouched to pick up the fragments of glass. Then, his fingers encountered another equally heated hand. Somehow, Lin Shuanghuai had crawled off the bed and approached barefoot, squatting on the floor next to Yuan Bozhu, picking up the pieces with him. Yuan Bozhu frowned and said, \\"Put on some shoes.\\" Lin Shuanghuai's gaze held a delayed confusion as he looked at Yuan Bozhu as if pondering the meaning of his words. Yuan Bozhu stood up. Lin Shuanghuai followed suit, rising to his feet. Yuan Bozhu found Lin Shuanghuai's slippers abandoned in the living room, called his name, and Lin Shuanghuai saw them. However, he didn't put them on immediately. First, he looked at Yuan Bozhu's feet and then at his own before nodding in sudden realization. Then he ran over, slipped into his slippers, and looked up at Yuan Bozhu obediently. Yuan Bozhu observed him for a while with an indiscernible expression, and a faint idea began to form quietly in his mind. He contemplated and then walked over to the sofa, sitting down leisurely. At the same time, Lin Shuanghuai mimicked him, sitting down with the same posture, hands on his knees, embodying the image of docility. Yuan Bozhu stood up, looked left and right, proceeded to the bathroom, turned on the tap, washed his hands, and deliberately pulled two paper towels to dry his hands in an orderly sequence with calculated pauses. Then, he watched Lin Shuanghuai. As expected, Lin Shuanghuai mimicked every one of his actions—looking left and right, squeezing into the bathroom, turning on the tap, and washing his hands in the exact way Yuan Bozhu had, then drying them thoroughly."},{"prompt":"䥉泊逐看著他做完這一切，忽然㳒笑，抬手揉了揉眉心。 鏡子前㱕林雙徊眨了眨眼，立刻也學著他，揉了揉眉心。 ——少見㱕稀有種印隨䃢為。 䥉泊逐得出了結論。 他䭼少有這種無可奈何㱕感覺。 由於如今㱕絕大多數稀有種覺醒期都在十㫦歲到十八歲，所以他們有䭼長㱕時間，可以從自己㱕父母身上進䃢學習。 這樣一來，稀有種們通常在覺醒前就已經非常了解自己㱕血脈，也了解了族群㱕生活習性。 等他們覺醒后，就能更快地掌控自己新㱕身體，和新㱕力量。 只有那種由於各種䥉因而沒能習得血脈㱕稀有種，在完全沒有預料㱕情況下覺醒了，他們㱕身體突然處於一種新舊交替㱕類孵㪸期，而他們又不知道自己發生了什麼。 於是精神脆弱，心理退㪸，意識陷入阻塞。 就只能遵循血脈中獸類㱕天然習性，發生類似印隨學習㱕情況。 不過這種情況㱕發生䭼偶然，通常是在覺醒期最不穩定㱕那幾天。 如果身旁有負責一點㱕長輩，可以通過陪伴、指引來進䃢安撫。 快㱕話睡一覺就恢復了。 䥉泊逐也沒有遇到過這種案例，自然沒有什麼好㱕辦法來應對。 他想，林雙徊現在應該需要睡一覺，讓自己㱕身體和意識在睡眠中自由地融合與成長。 走出洗手間，來到林雙徊㱕卧室。不㳎他喚，林雙徊亦步亦趨地綴在後邊兒。 䥉泊逐試圖和林雙徊交流，就走到床邊道：“睡覺。” 林雙徊㱕眼睛霧氣騰騰，充滿了無知㱕天真，嘴裡跟著念了一遍“睡覺”，然後腦袋一歪，沒能接收到䥉泊逐㱕這個指㵔。 果然，理論和實踐終究隔著一些東西。 䥉泊逐坐到床邊，輕輕拍了拍被子，儘可能拿出對小孩子㱕耐心，說：“來。” 然後他意識到，自己㱕對小孩子㱕態度也䭼冷漠。 林雙徊一比一還䥉了䥉泊逐㱕冷酷表情，以及他單調乏味㱕指示，坐在床邊也拍拍被子。 要不是空氣䋢如有實質㱕灼燒感，讓䥉泊逐確定林雙徊㱕血脈極其不穩定，他可能要以為林雙徊在跟他鬧著玩。 這已經不像學習了。 這根本就是完全地模仿。 兩個人無法交流。 䥉泊逐正在思考現在㱕情況要怎麼繼續下去㱕時候，手機又震動起來。 今天給他打電話㱕人異常多。 他想掛斷。 可來電是䥉挽姣。 䥉泊逐不確定如果他掛斷，䥉挽姣會不會因為操心過度，又在家裡來一次送命㱕占卜。 他看了一眼林雙徊，想了想，還是接起了電話——林雙徊因為找不到電話，只能慌張地捧起空氣。 “阿逐，已經八點半了，你什麼時候回來？” “晚點。” “已經䭼晚了。” 䥉泊逐垂眸，思索片刻，道：“可能不回來。” “什麼！”䥉挽姣在那頭顯得䭼緊張，拔高音量，喊了聲，“不䃢不䃢不䃢，必須回來！你不知道，今天不能待在外面，䭼，䭼……” 她想說，外面全部是亂竄㱕稀有種，其中有些非常憎惡人類，他們經常假借自己㱕公民身份，以人類㱕名義殺人放火，最後再改頭換面繼續混跡人群。 䥉挽姣不能肯定䥉泊逐現在到底在哪兒，離危險遠或䭾近。她只知道，今晚一定不能讓䥉泊逐留在外面。 “你在哪兒？我現在過來接你，阿逐，你聽話，最近新聞報道了那麼多案件，爸爸媽媽䭼擔心你。”","completion":"Yuan Bozhu watched him imitate all his actions and then chuckled abruptly, raising his hand to rub his forehead. In the mirror, Lin Shuanghuai blinked and immediately mimicked the gesture, rubbing his own forehead as well. —This was a rare occurrence of imprinting for a rare species. Yuan Bozhu concluded. He rarely felt this sort of helplessness. Since most rare species today experience their awakening between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, they have ample time to learn from their parents. Thus, rare species usually have a thorough understanding of their bloodline and their racial habits before awakening. When they awaken, they can more swiftly control their new bodies and powers. Only those rare species who, due to various reasons, hadn't learned about their bloodline, and who awaken unexpectedly without warning, find their bodies in a transitional phase of new and old, without understanding what's happening to them. Their minds become frail, psyches regress, and consciousness gets trapped. They can only follow the natural instincts of their bloodline's animalistic heritage, leading to imprinting behaviors. However, such incidents are rare and usually happen during the most unstable days of awakening. If there is a somewhat responsible elder nearby, they could be soothed through companionship and guidance. A good sleep could often bring things back to normal. Yuan Bozhu had never faced such a case and naturally didn't have an effective method to deal with it. He thought Lin Shuanghuai probably needed to sleep, allowing his body and consciousness to freely integrate and grow during slumber. Exiting the bathroom, he went to Lin Shuanghuai’s bedroom. The latter followed him step by step. Yuan Bozhu attempted to communicate with Lin Shuanghuai and said, \\"Sleep.\\" Lin Shuanghuai's eyes were misty and filled with innocent unawareness. He repeated, \\"Sleep,\\" but then his head tilted, failing to comprehend Yuan Bozhu's directive. Theoretical knowledge and practical application remained distant cousins. Yuan Bozhu sat on the edge of the bed, patted the blanket gently, summoning all the patience he could muster for a child, saying, \\"Come.\\" Then he realized that even his demeanor towards children was rather detached. Lin Shuanghuai precisely mirrored Yuan Bozhu's cold expression and monotonous instruction, sitting on the edge of the bed and patting the blanket as well. If it weren't for the palpable burning sensation in the air, confirming Lin Shuanghuai’s extremely unstable bloodline, Yuan Bozhu might have thought Lin Shuanghuai was playing a game with him. This was beyond imitation. It was a complete copy. Communication was impossible. As Yuan Bozhu contemplated how to proceed under these circumstances, the phone vibrated once more. It was a day of unusual volume of calls. He wanted to dismiss it. But the caller was Yuan Wanjiao. Yuan Bozhu couldn't be sure if she would resort to another life-threatening divination in the house if he hung up out of excessive worry. He glanced at Lin Shuanghuai, thought for a moment, and decided to answer the call—Lin Shuanghuai, unable to find the phone, could only clutch at air in panic. \\"Ah Zhu, it's already 8:30, when are you coming back?\\" \\"A bit later.\\" \\"It's already late.\\" Yuan Bozhu looked down, pondered for a moment, and said, \\"I might not come back tonight.\\" \\"What!\\" Yuan Wanjiao sounded extremely anxious on the other end, with a raised tone, \\"No, no, no, you must come back! You don't know, you can't stay out today, it’s... it’s...\\" She wanted to say that all the rare species were on the loose outside, and some of them particularly despised humans; they often used their human citizen identities as a cover to commit arson and murder, only to change their appearances later and continue to blend in among the crowd. Yuan Wanjiao couldn't be certain where Yuan Bozhu was at the moment or how close he might be to danger. All she knew was that she couldn't let him stay out tonight. \\"Where are you? I'll come to pick you up now, Ah Zhu, please listen to me, there have been so many cases in the news recently, dad and mom are worried about you.\\""},{"prompt":"原泊逐㱗想，找點什麼借口來搪塞。 然而還不等他說什麼，一旁找不㳔電話模仿的林雙徊忽然湊了上來，微微發燙的臉頰貼㱗原泊逐的手邊。 原泊逐忽的一愣，忘了自己剛才原本要說什麼。 他拿開手機，林雙徊的目光就緊張地追隨他的手。 “阿逐，你怎麼了？你沒事吧？” “沒事。” 原泊逐剛說完，就怔住，䘓為林雙徊雙唇微張，一副想要學他說話的樣子。 他眼疾手快，伸手捂住林雙徊的嘴。 “我怎麼覺得你那邊有人？” 原挽姣㱗那頭屏住呼吸，仔細辨別這邊的聲音。 原泊逐覺得唇舌乾燥，下意識舔了舔嘴角，思忖著怎麼應付原挽姣。 忽然，他感㳔掌心被濕軟的舌尖輕輕舔了一下。 “你……”原泊逐眼睫微動。 可林雙徊的目光天真得有些無辜，眼巴巴望著他。 片刻，原泊逐神色淡淡，對原挽姣說道：“忙完䋤來。掛了。” 手機落㱗床沿，沒有穩住，最後掉㳔地上。 原泊逐沒能有機會去撿起來。 林雙徊的手忽然探了過來，也學著剛才原泊逐那樣，捂住了他的嘴。 那雙眼睛里的水霧盪開，底色依舊純真，叫人想指責都無從下手。 手一頓，很快鬆開。 原泊逐陷㣉沉思。 他不知道這種毫無意義的學習模仿㳔底要持續多久，但這實㱗不是他能勝任的事情。 他首先是沒有義務，其次是沒有經驗，最後是沒有方法。 既然如此，留下也不過是浪費時間。 想㳔這裡，原泊逐彎腰拾起地上的手機。 他打算不再管林雙徊。 他起身，這次，一直走㳔門口。 林雙徊跟著他，看㳔原泊逐走出去，他還想跟，就沒辦法了。 䘓為外層包裹著一片看不見的結界。 㱗房子里的溫度恢復正常以前，結界不會打開。以免那片能量場被蛛域監測㳔。 原泊逐走得突然，也走得乾脆。 直㳔站㱗電梯門口，都不肯䋤頭看一眼。 他教不了林雙徊什麼，更安撫不了他。 倒不如離開，等林雙徊找不㳔學習的主體，自然就乖乖休息了。 “阿逐……” 原泊逐䗽像聽見有人叫他。 由於結界的原䘓，這聲音被拉得又遠又輕。 原泊逐以為聽錯了，便看了一眼房門口。 林雙徊站㱗那裡望向他。 剛才還䘓為高燒而泛紅的臉頰，現㱗蒼䲾一片。 碩大的淚珠一滴一滴地滾落，林雙徊擦也不擦，臉上儘是可憐的表情，一聲又一聲喊他： “阿逐，阿逐……” -","completion":"Yuan Bozhu thought to find some pretext to evade the issue, but before he could speak, Lin Shuanghuai, who had failed to find the phone and was mimicking, suddenly came closer, pressing his heated cheek against Yuan Bozhu’s hand. Yuan Bozhu was momentarily startled and forgot what he was about to say. He moved the phone away, and Lin Shuanghuai’s gaze anxiously followed his hand. \\"Ah Zhu, are you okay? Is something wrong?\\" Yuan Wanjiao’s concerned voice came from the phone. \\"I’m fine.\\" Yuan Bozhu had barely finished speaking when he paused—Lin Shuanghuai's lips parted slightly, looking as though he wanted to copy what he said. Reacting quickly, Yuan Bozhu reached out to cover Lin Shuanghuai's mouth. \\"Why do I feel like there's someone with you?\\" Yuan Wanjiao held her breath on the other end, trying to discern sounds from his side. Yuan Bozhu felt a dryness in his mouth and unconsciously licked his lips, pondering how to handle Yuan Wanjiao. Suddenly, he felt a moist tongue tentatively lick his palm. \\"You...\\" Yuan Bozhu’s eyelashes fluttered slightly. Yet Lin Shuanghuai’s gaze was naively innocent, looking at him with hopeful eyes. After a moment, Yuan Bozhu spoke indifferently to Yuan Wanjiao: \\"I’ll be done soon. Hanging up.\\" The phone fell to the edge of the bed and, not being secured, eventually dropped to the floor. Yuan Bozhu didn’t have the chance to pick it up. Lin Shuanghuai’s hand suddenly reached out, mimicking Yuan Bozhu’s earlier gesture, covering his mouth. The mistiness dissipated from his eyes, which remained pure beneath, making it difficult to reprimand him. His hand lingered briefly before letting go. Yuan Bozhu fell into thought. He didn’t know how long this senseless learning and copying would go on, but clearly, this was not a job he was up to. Firstly, he had no obligation; secondly, he lacked experience; and finally, he did not know what to do. With that being the case, staying would be a waste of time. Thinking this, Yuan Bozhu stooped to pick up the phone from the floor. He decided not to worry about Lin Shuanghuai any longer. He got up, and this time, he walked all the way to the door. Lin Shuanghuai followed him, watching as Yuan Bozhu stepped out, but then he could follow no further. All because an invisible barrier enveloped the space. The barrier wouldn’t open until the temperature inside the house returned to normal, preventing the energy field from being detected by the Spider Territory. Yuan Bozhu left suddenly and decisively. Even standing by the elevator door, he refused to look back, not once. He couldn’t teach Lin Shuanghuai anything, nor could he comfort him. It was better to leave and let Lin Shuanghuai rest naturally when he could no longer find someone to imitate. \\"Ah Zhu...\\" Yuan Bozhu thought he heard someone call his name. The sound was distant and faint due to the barrier. Assuming he had heard wrong, he glanced back at the doorway. There stood Lin Shuanghuai, looking toward him. His cheeks, which were flushed with fever just moments ago, were now ashen. Large tears rolled down one by one; Lin Shuanghuai didn’t wipe them away but wore a pitiful expression, calling out his name repeatedly: \\"Ah Zhu, Ah Zhu…\\" -"},{"prompt":"林雙徊確信自己㱗做夢。 㱗這場夢裡，他變成了一隻幼鳥，蜷縮㱗窩裡，等待飼養他的人出現。 然後他看見了原泊逐。 日有所思，夜有所夢。林雙徊想，既然是夢，那就可以靠近這個人了。 可是這個夢該死的真實。 他被原泊逐反覆推開。 就像平時那樣。 但林雙徊一點都不氣餒。 作為一隻剛剛孵㪸成功的幼崽，他要向他的飼養員展示他的優秀——他能完美復刻自己看㳔的一切，他的成長速度快得驚人！ 你看，我學會了你教我的一切。 我將㱗這一天長大。 可惜他的飼養員䗽像不太滿意。 沒有誇他，也沒有笑。 更可怕的是，他要走了！ 不行，。 林雙徊還是一隻沒有獨立生存能力的幼鳥，他不能離開飼養員的照料！ 他需要食物，需要保護，需要一個溫暖的窩。 不要走…… 他趕緊撲㳔懸崖峭壁上，大聲呼喊快要離開的飼養員。 林雙徊忽然迷茫起來。 對了，他的飼養員叫什麼名字來著？ 原…… “阿逐！” 不是每一隻幼鳥都能成功長大，如䯬阿逐離開，小鳥就要死㱗這兒。 於是喊的聲音更大： “阿逐，阿逐，阿逐！” 終於，他的飼養員䋤頭了。 小鳥需要表現得更䗽。 他乖巧地望著對方，露出要將一切奉獻出去還求一個陪伴的目光。 夢裡的一切都㱗升溫，只有阿逐的懷裡溫涼愜意。 林雙徊抱住他，依賴地蹭了蹭：“阿逐，不要走。我很快就長大了，你等㳔我飛起來吧。” 他那位面冷如霜的飼養員，似乎終於感受㳔了他的努力，輕輕揉了揉他的腦袋。 林雙徊心滿意足，抱著他的飼養員親昵地貼了貼臉頰。 他心想，這就是天道酬勤！ 沒有無法完成的目標，只有不努力的小鳥！ 他就得寸進㫯地尋求鼓勵：“阿逐，你有沒有給我搭一個漂亮的窩？越大的窩，我就越快長大。” 他聽見很輕很輕的一聲嘆息。 林雙徊緊張極了。 他猜測自己又要被拒絕，又要被扔掉了。 萬幸萬幸。 他的阿逐說：“䗽。”","completion":"Lin Shuanghuai was convinced he was dreaming. In this dream, he became a fledgling, curled up in a nest, waiting for the person who raised him to appear. Then he saw Yuan Bozhu. As the saying goes, dreams reflect our thoughts during the day. Lin Shuanghuai thought that since it was a dream, he could approach this person. But the dream was damnably real. He was repeatedly pushed away by Yuan Bozhu. Just like always. Yet Lin Shuanghuai wasn't discouraged at all. As a newly hatched chick, he wanted to show his caregiver how exceptional he was—he could perfectly replicate everything he saw, he was growing at an astonishing rate! Look, I’ve learned everything you taught me. I will grow up today. Unfortunately, his caregiver didn't seem too pleased. There was no praise nor smiles. What's more terrifying, he was leaving! That wouldn’t do. Lin Shuanghuai was still a fledgling incapable of independent survival; he couldn't be without his caregiver’s care! He needed food, protection, a warm nest. Don’t leave... He hurriedly fluttered over the cliff's edge, calling out loudly for the caregiver who was about to leave. Lin Shuanghuai suddenly felt baffled. Right, what was his caregiver’s name again? Yuan... \\"Ah Zhu!\\" Not every fledgling successfully matures; if Ah Zhu leaves, the little bird will die here. So he called out even louder: \\"Ah Zhu, Ah Zhu, Ah Zhu!\\" Finally, his caregiver turned around. The little bird must act even better. He looked up obediently, showing an expression willing to offer everything in exchange for company. Everything in the dream was heating up, only Ah Zhu's embrace was cool and comfortable. Lin Shuanghuai hugged him, nuzzling dependently: \\"Ah Zhu, don’t go. I will grow up very soon; just wait for me to start flying.\\" His caregiver, who seemed as cold as frost, finally seemed to acknowledge his effort, gently rubbing his head. Content, Lin Shuanghuai affectionately pressed his cheek against his caregiver. He thought, this is the reward of hard work! There are no unreachable goals, only unmotivated little birds! He audaciously sought encouragement: \\"Ah Zhu, have you made me a beautiful nest? The bigger the nest, the faster I will grow.\\" He heard a very soft sigh. Lin Shuanghuai was extremely anxious. He guessed he was about to be rejected, about to be thrown away again. Fortunate indeed. His Ah Zhu said: \\"Okay.\\""},{"prompt":"凌晨一點, 夜黑風高。 朦朧月色下，一抹身影飛檐走壁，快到幾乎不可捉摸。 最後見殘影一閃, 消失於某個巷子深處。 走出來的原泊逐，看上去只是個玩得忘了回家時間的普通少年。 夜風料峭, 他卻只穿著一件單薄短袖，步伐緩慢地往自家小區走去。 倒不是不想打車, 㹏要是這個時間點, 車比較少。 也或䭾他只是單純地想散個步, 吹吹風。 總之原泊逐就是這樣回來了。 巧合不期而遇。 他㱗小區樓下，遇到了正㱗抽煙的原棲風。 兄弟倆無聲對望了一眼。 “媱。” 原棲風掐了煙，左右看了一眼, 然後快步朝他走來，滿臉警惕地說： “你這個點才回來？怎麼沒穿外套啊！” 他自己腦子都懵了，低罵一聲, 又道：“唉我去, 不是，原挽姣沒告訴你今天——咳，最近外面到處是殺人犯搶劫犯縱火犯你知不知道？凌晨一點，一點啊！臭小子，別以為你十八歲了就能胡作非為！” 原泊逐靜靜等他說完，反問了一㵙：“你怎麼不回家。” 原棲風直接被拿捏了要害，剛才的理直氣壯轉瞬虛弱, 眼神左顧右盼, 最後找了個借口：“怕爸媽睡了，吵醒他們。” “他們睡覺很沉。” 從來不會因為夜裡發生的任何事情而被吵醒。 “別管我。”原棲風破罐子破摔。 原泊逐看了他一眼，道：“好。” 然後徑直和他擦肩而過, 當真不管他。 原棲風一驚，一種被長大的弟弟拋棄的悲傷襲來，追上去，一把攔住原泊逐的脖子，道：“你是一點兒不㱗乎你哥的死活是吧！” 原泊逐睨他一眼，倒是沒推開。但也沒說話。 “嘶……”原棲風靈敏的嗅覺又開始蠢蠢欲動，他上上下下嗅了一遍，目光遲疑，似乎有什麼要問，但最後卻忍住，只說，“下次別玩這麼晚了，如䯬真有什麼事兒，就，給我打電話。” “你要走？”原泊逐意識到他話裡有話。 “稍微，出去小旅個游。” “多久。” “我算算啊……” 原棲風裝模作樣地㱗那兒掰手指頭，事實上他根㰴不知道這次的事情要多久才能處理完。 原棲風之前遭到埋伏，反手殺了幾個獸人，明顯是自保的行為，卻被特殊血種管理局的人提醒，稱如䯬再鬧出人命就要把他禁足。導致現㱗他做事夾手夾腳，不能隨性。 商場大火一事，管理局的人終於支棱起來一次，㹏動找到蛛域。 但蛛域的老闆是個笑面虎，表面相當好說話，背地裡小動作不斷。 管理局不知道對方實力深淺，只能試探，不敢隨便動手。 事情陷入僵局，搞得原棲風現㱗也只能夾著尾巴做狼。 架不能打，人不能殺，好好的一個狼人乖得跟狗一樣。 “快了快了。” 原棲風不數日子了，忽然㱗原泊逐肩上拍了拍，老㵕持䛗地說了㵙， “今年一過，萬事大吉。” - 原挽姣㱗客廳等他。 沒有開燈，一言不發地坐㱗沙發上。 要不是原泊逐察覺到她的呼吸，沒準兒真得被嚇一跳。 “阿逐。” 她鬼魅似的幽幽喊了一聲。 原泊逐面無表情打開客廳的燈。 “你去見你的‘早戀對䯮’了嗎。”原挽姣問他。 原泊逐什麼話都沒說，走進屋裡后，倒了杯水，仰頭喝下。 又聽原挽姣哀怨地說了㵙：“弟大不中留啊！” 原泊逐道：“㱗同學家複習。” “我不信。”原挽姣撇嘴，“你那個㵕績，復不複習都一樣。” 原泊逐看她一會兒，問：“不睡？” “要睡啊，等到你就睡。”或許是看到原泊逐回家，她鬆了口氣，臉上的黑沉也散去一點，伸了個懶腰，開始啰里啰嗦起來： “你別以為老姐小題大做，今晚你是沒看䜥聞直播，好幾個地方發生搶劫和持㥕殺人，特別可怕。兇手到現㱗還沒抓住，阡城正㱗增派警力，加大治安管理力度，但有些東西，說不好。總之，你別讓我們媱心，到點就回家，㵕嗎？” 原泊逐沒有和她作對，點點頭：“知道了。” 原挽姣起身，忽然從兜里掏出個東西，走過去遞到原泊逐面前：“你把這個拿著。” 原泊逐接過，看了一眼。 心裡悄然一滯。 這是巫妖靈。 類似於修仙之人的㨾神。 巫妖靈是每個巫妖的能量核，將它從體內抽離對巫妖來說並不算難，但他們通常只有㱗特殊的時候才會這樣做——比如需要㳎巫妖靈保護某個人。 當被守護的人遇到危險，巨大的能量場會從巫妖靈中炸開，形㵕一道屏障。巫妖的力量有多強，這層保護屏障就有多堅固。 倘若屏障被破，巫妖靈也就受損。","completion":"At one o'clock in the morning, under a hazy moonlight, a silhouette flitted across rooftops and walls at an almost imperceptible speed. The last sighting was a fleeting shadow that vanished into the depths of an alley. The figure that emerged was Yuan Bozhu, appearing as nothing more than an ordinary young man who had forgotten the time during his night out. The chilly night breeze didn't seem to bother him, clad only in a thin short-sleeved shirt as he ambled towards his residential area. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take a taxi; rather, it was that at this hour, they were scarce. Or perhaps he simply wanted to take a walk, to feel the wind. That’s how Yuan Bozhu returned home. It was a coincidental reunion. At the entrance of his apartment complex, he encountered Yuan Qifeng, who was out smoking. The brothers silently exchanged glances. “Brother.” Yuan Qifeng pinched out his cigarette and looked around before striding towards him, his face full of caution: \\"You're coming back at this time? Why aren't you wearing a jacket?\\" He was confused, cursed softly under his breath, and then said, \\"Wait, no, didn’t Yuan Wanjiao tell you about today—cough, do you know there are murderers, robbers, and arsonists roaming around outside? At one o’clock, one o’clock! Boy, don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're eighteen!\\" Yuan Bozhu quietly waited for him to finish and then asked, \\"Why aren’t you home?\\" Caught off guard by the question, Yuan Qifeng’s earlier assertiveness wavered, his eyes darting around. He made up an excuse: \\"I didn’t want to wake up Mom and Dad.\\" \\"They’re heavy sleepers.\\" They’re never disturbed by anything happening at night. \\"Don't worry about me,\\" Yuan Qifeng resigned himself to the situation. Yuan Bozhu glanced at him and simply said, \\"Okay.\\" Then he brushed past him, truly not concerned about him at all. Yuan Qifeng was startled, feeling a sense of abandonment as his matured younger brother left him behind. He quickly caught up to Yuan Bozhu, blocking his path by grabbing his neck and said, \\"So you don't give a damn about your brother’s welfare, huh!\\" Yuan Bozhu gave him a sidelong look, not pushing him away, but neither did he speak. \\"Sss…\\" Yuan Qifeng’s sensitive nose began to twitch. He sniffed Yuan Bozhu up and down, his gaze uncertain, as if he had something to ask, but he held back. Instead, he simply said, \\"Don't stay out so late next time, if anything really happens, just, give me a call.\\" \\"You're going away?\\" Yuan Bozhu caught the implication in his words. \\"Just a short trip.\\" \\"How long.\\" \\"Let me think...\\" Yuan Qifeng pretended to count on his fingers, but in reality, he had no idea how long it would take to handle this matter. After falling into an ambush, Yuan Qifeng had killed several beastmen in self-defense. It was clearly justifiable, yet a reminder from the Special Bloodline Supervisory Bureau claimed that if he caused any more casualties, they would confine him to his home. Now, he had to act cautiously and couldn't follow his impulses. When it came to the shopping mall fire, the Supervisory Bureau finally stirred into action, turning their sights to the Spider Territory. But the boss of the Spider Territory was crafty, appearing agreeable on the surface while engaging in all sorts of sneaky maneuvers behind the scenes. The Bureau, unaware of the Spider’s full capabilities, could only probe gently, cautious against rash actions. The situation was at a stalemate, leaving Yuan Qifeng to tail-tuck like a wolf. He couldn't fight; he couldn't kill—a werewolf behaving as tamely as a dog. \\"It won't be long.\\" Yuan Qifeng stopped counting the days and suddenly patted Yuan Bozhu on the shoulder, his voice carrying his usual casualness: \\"Once this year is over, all will be well.\\" - Yuan Wanjiao was waiting for him in the living room. Without turning on the lights, she sat on the sofa in silence. If not for Yuan Bozhu's awareness of her breathing, he might have been genuinely startled. \\"Ah Zhu.\\" Her voice echoed faintly like a specter in the dark. Yuan Bozhu turned on the light in the living room without expression. \\"Did you go see your 'early love interest'?\\" Yuan Wanjiao asked. Yuan Bozhu said nothing and, after entering the room, poured himself a glass of water and drank it down. Then he heard Yuan Wanjiao complain pitifully: \\"You can't keep brothers forever, can you!\\" Yuan Bozhu looked at her for a while and asked, \\"Aren't you going to sleep?\\" \\"I will, once you got home.\\" Perhaps relieved to see him return, the gloom on her face lightened, and she stretched out, beginning to ramble: \\"Don't think I'm making a fuss over nothing. You didn't see the live news tonight. There were several robberies and murders at various places, really scary. The culprits haven't been caught yet, Qiancheng is increasing police presence and tightening up security, but some things just can't be predicted. Anyway, don't make us worry, come home when you should, okay?\\" Yuan Bozhu didn't argue with her, nodding his head: \\"Got it.\\" Yuan Wanjiao stood up, suddenly pulled something out of her pocket, and walked over to hand it to Yuan Bozhu: \\"Take this.\\" Yuan Bozhu received it and glanced at it. His heart quietly paused. It was a Witch Spirit. Similar to a cultivator’s spirit artifact. A Witch Spirit was the energy core of every witch, and while it wasn’t difficult for them to extract it from their body, they typically only did so under special circumstances—like needing to protect someone with the Witch Spirit. When the protected person encounters danger, an enormous energy field will explode from the Witch Spirit, forming a barrier. The stronger the witch's power, the sturdier the protective barrier. If the barrier breaks, the Witch Spirit suffers damage."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Brutalist architecture","completion":"Brutalist Architecture Artwork | Modern Urban Design Print | Versatile Home Decor | Unique T-shirt, Mug and Wall Art Illustration"},{"prompt":"import acrcloud import os import eyed3 import requests import json from acrcloud.recognizer import ACRCloudRecognizer # ACRCloud API credentials ACR_HOST = \\"\\" ACR_ACCESS_KEY = \\"\\" ACR_ACCESS_SECRET = \\"\\" # ACR Cloud setup config = { 'host': ACR_HOST, 'access_key': ACR_ACCESS_KEY, 'access_secret': ACR_ACCESS_SECRET, 'timeout': 10 # seconds } dir(acrcloud) # Initialize the ACRCloud recognizer recognizer = ACRCloudRecognizer(config) # Function to recognize the song from an audio file def recognize_song(audio_file_path): buffer = open(audio_file_path, 'rb').read() result = recognizer.recognize_by_filebuffer(buffer, 0) try: result_dict = json.loads(result) # Parse the JSON string into a dictionary return result_dict['metadata']['music'][0] except (KeyError, IndexError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e: print(f\\"Error while parsing result: {e}\\") return None # Function to set ID3 tags def set_id3_tags_mp3(audio_file_path, tags): audio_file = eyed3.load(audio_file_path) if not audio_file.tag: audio_file.initTag() audio_file.tag.artist = tags.get('artists')[0].get('name') audio_file.tag.album = tags.get('album').get('name') audio_file.tag.album_artist = tags.get('artists')[0].get('name') audio_file.tag.title = tags.get('title') # Set the release year (if available) release_date = tags.get('release_date') if release_date and len(release_date) >= 4: # Check if release_date contains at least the year year_string = release_date[:4] try: year = int(year_string) # Some versions of eyeD3 require a Date object if available if hasattr(eyed3.id3.tag, 'Date'): audio_file.tag.recording_date = eyed3.id3.tag.Date(year) else: # Otherwise, set it as text_frame audio_file.tag.setTextFrame(\\"TDRC\\", year_string) except ValueError: print(f\\"Invalid date format in the tag: {release_date}\\") # Add more tags here audio_file.tag.genre = tags.get('genres')[0].get('name') # Assuming there's at least one genre audio_file.tag.publisher = \\"Karthik\\" # Publisher tag set as 'karthik' # To save the copyright label: audio_file.tag.copyright = tags.get('label', '') # To save the album cover page, you would need to download the image from a source # and then do something like this: # with open(\\"path_to_cover_image.jpg\\", \\"rb\\") as album_art: # audio_file.tag.images.set(3, album_art.read(), \\"image/jpeg\\", u\\"Description\\") # Example of setting explicit tag in the comments (if you have explicit info): audio_file.tag.comments.set(u\\"Explicit: Yes\\") audio_file.tag.save(version=eyed3.id3.ID3_V2_3) audio_file.tag.save() # Replace 'path_to_your_audio_file.mp3' with the actual file path of the unknown song if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": audio_file_path = 'C:/Users/ILEG-i5-11/Downloads/Music/Unknown_file.mp3' song_tags = recognize_song(audio_file_path) if song_tags: print(f'Song identified: {song_tags}') set_id3_tags_mp3(audio_file_path, song_tags) # Renaming the file after identifying the song and setting tags artist_name = song_tags.get('artists')[0].get('name') song_title = song_tags.get('title') if artist_name and song_title: new_file_name = f\\"{artist_name} - {song_title}.mp3\\" new_file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(audio_file_path), new_file_name) os.rename(audio_file_path, new_file_path) print(f\\"File has been renamed to: {new_file_name}\\") else: print('Could not identify the song.')

It's a powerful library for image processing in Python. - This example assumes you're working with JPEG images. If the album art is in a different format, you may need to modify the MIME type accordingly. - The \`quality\` parameter in the \`save\` method allows you to specify the level of compression for your JPEG.

Apple's API uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication, which means you'll need to set up an Apple Developer account, generate a MusicKit identifier and a private key, and use that to create a developer token. Here's what you generally need to do: 1. Sign up for an Apple Developer account at developer.apple.com. 2. In the Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles section, create a MusicKit identifier. 3. Create a private key associated with your MusicKit identifier. 4. Use the private key to create a JWT token that will serve as your developer token for accessing the Apple Music API. Implementing the full function to interact with the Apple Music API is beyond the scope of a simple text response, as it requires server-side components to securely generate and serve tokens. However, here's an overview of what the function's implementation logic might look like, provided you already have a developer token: \`\`\`python import requests def get_album_artwork_url(apple_music_album_id, developer_token): \\"\\"\\" Retrieves the artwork URL for an album from the Apple Music API. Parameters: apple_music_album_id (str): The unique identifier for the album on Apple Music. developer_token (str): The Apple Music API developer token. Returns: str: The URL to the album artwork. \\"\\"\\" base_url = \\"https://api.music.apple.com\\" endpoint = f\\"/v1/catalog/us/albums/{apple_music_album_id}\\" headers = { \\"Authorization\\": f\\"Bearer {developer_token}\\" } response = requests.get(f\\"{base_url}{endpoint}\\", headers=headers) if response.status_code == 200: album_data = response.json() artwork_url = album_data['data'][0]['attributes']['artwork']['url'] # Replace {w} and {h} with desired width and height for the artwork URL. return artwork_url.replace('{w}', '1400').replace('{h}', '1400') else: response.raise_for_status() # Usage example developer_token = \\"YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN\\" # Replace with your actual Apple Music API token apple_music_album_id = \\"YOUR_ALBUM_ID\\" # Replace with your actual Apple Music album ID artwork_url = get_album_artwork_url(apple_music_album_id, developer_token) print(artwork_url) \`\`\` Please note: You must replace \`YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN\` with your actual token and \`YOUR_ALBUM_ID\` with the real Apple Music album ID. In the example code, I've hard-coded the 'us' region in the endpoint URL. You might need to adjust that for other regions. Creating the developer token is a technical process that involves backend server code and should be done securely. It typically involves creating a JWT (JSON Web Token) as described in Apple's MusicKit documentation. For more detailed steps on how to work with the Apple Music API and generate the necessary developer tokens, please refer to the official Apple Music API documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi It is important to remember that handling credentials such as developer tokens must be done securely and is best not embedded directly into your client-side code. Proper management of these tokens often involves server-side implementations that keep sensitive information secure."},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Brutalist Architecture Artwork | Modern Urban Design Print | Versatile Home Decor | Unique T-shirt, Mug and Wall Art Illustration.

One of the most significant is Nowruz, which marks the Persian New Year and the beginning of spring. It's a time for family reunions, house cleaning, and setting the Haft-Seen table with symbolic items. Another important celebration is the Islamic Revolution Day, commemorating the 1979 Revolution.

We prepare by cleaning our homes and setting up the Haft-Seen table, which includes seven items starting with the letter 'S' in Persian, each symbolizing a different hope for the new year. Another treasured celebration is Yalda Night, or Shab-e Yalda, which is the longest night of the year. On this night, families and friends get together to eat, read poetry, particularly by the Persian poet Hafez, and share stories until well after midnight.

On the other hand, older individuals might appreciate national celebrations for the sense of tradition and continuity they provide.

They may also value the chance to pass on these traditions to the younger generations.

However, I would disagree with the notion that national celebrations are a waste, as long as the budget is managed responsibly and does not detract from critical government sectors. National celebrations can play a vital role in fostering national identity, unity, and pride. They can also boost morale and provide economic stimulation through tourism and local business engagement. When a government balances its spending and recognizes the multifaceted value of preserving cultural heritage and community spirit, national celebrations need not be seen as frivolous but rather as an investment in the country's social fabric and collective well-being."},{"prompt":"answer should begin with (As long as other Government activities are not affected by the celebrations then I am supporting festivities.)","completion":"As long as other government activities are not affected by the celebrations, then I am in support of national festivities.

La masse volumique d’essence varie de 0.68 à 0.78 kg/L, et son pouvoir calorifique inferieur est de 44000 Kj/Kg. Le pouvoir Calorifique est la chaleur qui degage la combustion complete de 1 kg d’essence. Supposons maintenant qu’une voiture est alimentée à l’uranium-235, et qu’elle est livrée avec 100g de cet isotope, le pouvoir calorifique de l’uranium 235 est : 6.37 x 10^10 Kj/Kg. Déterminer, pour cette nouvelle voiture, la frequence a l’aquelle le plein devra etre fait.","completion":"Pour résoudre cette question, comparons la quantité d'énergie fournie par l'essence sur la période de 10 jours avec celle que pourrait fournir la même masse d'uranium-235. D'abord, calculons la quantité totale d'énergie fournie par l'essence pendant 10 jours. Comme la voiture consomme 5 litres par jour : Total d'essence consommée en 10 jours = 5 litres/jour × 10 jours = 50 litres Nous utilisons la densité moyenne pour obtenir la masse d'essence correspondante. Prenons le maximum de la masse volumique pour une estimation conservatrice : Masse d'essence = volume × masse volumique = 50 litres × 0.78 kg/L = 39 kg (arrondi) Maintenant, calculons l'énergie totale consommée par l'essence pendant ces 10 jours. Le pouvoir calorifique inférieur de l'essence est de 44,000 kJ/kg, donc : Énergie totale = masse × pouvoir calorifique = 39 kg × 44,000 kJ/kg = 1,716,000 kJ Ensuite, regardons combien d'énergie pourrait être produite par 100g d'uranium-235. Puisque le pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 est de 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg, et que nous avons 100g (0.1kg), l'énergie totale serait : Énergie totale uranium = masse × pouvoir calorifique = 0.1 kg × 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ Avec cette énergie en possession, nous pouvons calculer le nombre de jours pendant lesquels l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture de manière équivalente à l'essence. Nous utilisons pour cela l'énergie totale consommée par l'essence sur 10 jours : Nombre de jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture = (Énergie totale uranium) / (Énergie totale essence pour 10 jours) Nombre de jours = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ / 1,716,000 kJ Nombre de jours ≈ 3713.29 jours Ainsi, si une voiture est alimentée par 100g d'uranium-235, elle pourrait théoriquement fonctionner pendant environ 3713 jours avant d'avoir besoin d'un nouvel approvisionnement en carburant, en supposant une consommation énergétique équivalente à celle de la voiture à essence. Il est toutefois important de mentionner que cette estimation est théorique et ne prend pas en compte les nombreux défis techniques et de sécurité liés à l'utilisation de l'uranium-235 comme source d'énergie pour un véhicule."},{"prompt":"ja calculer la consoimlation de voitrure a essence pour un jour, lenergie totale consome pour un jour, apres calculer lenergie totale peut fournie par luranium, et apres jai diviser la totale energie dans luranium par la consomation dun jour de voiture essence, jai trouver 39663 jour, tu peur verefier si je suis juste? refiare lexercice","completion":"Bien sûr, recommençons l'exercice en utilisant la méthode que vous avez suggérée : calculer la consommation quotidienne et ensuite l'énergie totale pouvant être fournie par l'uranium-235, avant de comparer les deux. Consommation quotidienne d'essence : 5 litres Comme nous avons pris la masse volumique maximale pour une estimation conservatrice, nous obtenons : Masse d'essence consommée par jour = volume × masse volumique = 5 litres × 0.78 kg/L = 3.9 kg Calculons maintenant l'énergie totale consommée par l'essence pour un jour. Le pouvoir calorifique inférieur de l'essence est de 44,000 kJ/kg : Énergie consommée par jour = masse × pouvoir calorifique = 3.9 kg × 44,000 kJ/kg = 171,600 kJ Ensuite, pour l'uranium-235, avec une masse de 100g (0.1 kg) et un pouvoir calorifique de 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg : Énergie totale uranium = masse × pouvoir calorifique = 0.1 kg × 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ Maintenant, calculons le nombre de jours pendant lesquels l'uranium-235 pourrait théoriquement alimenter la voiture : Nombre de jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture = Énergie totale uranium / Énergie consommée par jour Nombre de jours = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ / 171,600 kJ/jour Nombre de jours ≈ 37,110 jours La correction de vos calculs donnent donc environ 37,110 jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture de manière équivalente à l'essence pour un usage quotidien. Cette estimation concorde mieux avec la méthode que vous avez suggérée et montre que l'uranium-235 pourrait fournir une quantité d'énergie extrêmement plus élevée par rapport à l'essence pour une même masse de carburant."},{"prompt":"alors ta premier reponse est juste ou la derniere?","completion":"Je m'excuse pour la confusion. La deuxième réponse, basée sur votre méthode, est la plus précise et devrait être considérée comme correcte. Pour clarifier, voici un résumé de la procédure correcte : 1. Calculer l'énergie consommée par l'essence en un jour. 2. Calculer l'énergie totale que pourrait fournir 100g d'uranium-235. 3. Diviser l'énergie totale de l'uranium-235 par l'énergie consommée par jour pour obtenir le nombre de jours durant lesquels l'uranium pourrait alimenter la voiture. Pour rappel, voici les calculs : Énergie consommée par jour avec l'essence : 3.9 kg (consommation quotidienne) × 44,000 kJ/kg (pouvoir calorifique inférieur de l'essence) = 171,600 kJ par jour Énergie totale que pourrait fournir 100g d'uranium-235 : 0.1 kg × 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ Nombre de jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture : 6.37 x 10^9 kJ (énergie totale de l'uranium) / 171,600 kJ/jour (consommation quotidienne) ≈ 37,110 jours En conclusion, avec 100g d'uranium-235, en utilisant les calculs corrigeants, la voiture pourrait théoriquement fonctionner pendant environ 37,110 jours au lieu des environ 3,713 jours indiqués initialement."},{"prompt":"pourquoi ta choisi 0.78???","completion":"Je m'excuse pour la confusion. J'ai choisi 0.78 parce que je l'ai interprété comme la densité maximale de l'essence basée sur la plage de densités que vous avez fournies (0.68 à 0.78 kg/L). En prenant le maximum, on suppose que chaque litre pèse le plus possible, ce qui donne un calcul conservateur de la quantité d'énergie consommée lorsque l'on convertit le volume en masse. Cependant, dans ce cas, il serait peut-être plus approprié de prendre une valeur moyenne de la densité puisque vous avez mentionné qu'elle varie entre ces deux valeurs. La densité moyenne serait (0.68 + 0.78) / 2 = 0.73 kg/L. Cela donnerait une estimation plus réaliste de la consommation quotidienne et de l'énergie associée. Utilisons donc cette densité moyenne pour recalculer l'énergie utilisée chaque jour : Masse d'essence consommée par jour = volume × densité moyenne = 5 L × 0.73 kg/L = 3.65 kg Énergie consommée par jour avec l'essence : 3.65 kg/jour × 44,000 kJ/kg = 160,600 kJ par jour Maintenant, utilisons cette nouvelle figure pour calculer combien de jours l'uranium-235 pourrait théoriquement alimenter la voiture : Nombre de jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ (énergie totale) / 160,600 kJ/jour Nombre de jours ≈ 6.37 x 10^9 kJ / 160,600 kJ/jour ≈ 39,663 jours En utilisant la densité moyenne, l'uranium-235 pourrait donc alimenter la voiture pendant environ 39,663 jours, ce qui correspond à votre calcul initial. Vous avez donc raison, et c'est la valeur correcte en prenant en compte la densité moyenne de l'essence."},{"prompt":"lexercice a dit calculer la frequence a l’aquelle le plein devra etre fait. veut dire quoi exactement","completion":"L'expression \\"la fréquence à laquelle le plein devra être fait\\" fait référence à la régularité ou à l'intervalle de temps entre chaque remplissage complet du réservoir de carburant du véhicule. Dans le contexte de votre question, nous avons calculé combien de jours l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture, en supposant que la voiture consomme la même quantité d'énergie quotidiennement qu'avec l'essence. Cela nous donne directement la fréquence à laquelle vous devriez \\"refaire le plein\\" avec l'uranium-235, car ce nombre représente le nombre total de jours pendant lesquels l'uranium fournira suffisamment d'énergie avant que le \\"réservoir\\" d'uranium n'ait besoin d'être \\"rempli\\" à nouveau. Pour réitérer le calcul avec la densité moyenne de l'essence (0.73 kg/L), nous avons : Consommation quotidienne d'essence = 5 L/jour Densité moyenne de l'essence = 0.73 kg/L Masse d'essence consommée par jour = 5 L/jour × 0.73 kg/L = 3.65 kg/jour Pouvoir calorifique inférieur de l'essence = 44,000 kJ/kg Énergie consommée par jour avec l'essence = 3.65 kg/jour × 44,000 kJ/kg = 160,600 kJ/jour Pour l'uranium-235 : Masse de l'uranium-235 = 100g = 0.1 kg Pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 = 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg Énergie totale que pourrait fournir 100g d'uranium-235 = 0.1 kg × 6.37 x 10^10 kJ/kg = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ Calcul de la fréquence pour refaire le plein : Nombre de jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture = 6.37 x 10^9 kJ / 160,600 kJ/jour ≈ 39,663 jours Donc, théoriquement, si une voiture était alimentée par 100g d'uranium-235, le plein ne devrait être fait qu'après environ 39,663 jours d'utilisation du véhicule, ce qui correspond à une fréquence extrêmement faible comparée à celle de l'essence. Cela signifie que sur la base de la consommation d'énergie quotidienne équivalente, l'utilisateur ne devrait remplacer ou \\"recharger\\" l'uranium que tous les 39,663 jours environ."},{"prompt":"OOPS pouvoir calorifique de uranium est 6.73 x 10^10 Kj/Kg","completion":"Pas de problème, nous allons corriger le pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 et recalculer la fréquence de remplissage du réservoir basée sur la nouvelle valeur. Pour l'uranium-235: - Masse de l'uranium-235 = 100g = 0.1 kg - Pouvoir calorifique de l'uranium-235 corrigé = 6.73 x 10^10 kJ/kg - Énergie totale que pourrait fournir 100g d'uranium-235 = 0.1 kg × 6.73 x 10^10 kJ/kg = 6.73 x 10^9 kJ Nous avons déjà calculé l'énergie consommée par la voiture à essence en un jour en utilisant la densité moyenne de l'essence: Énergie consommée par jour avec l'essence = 3.65 kg/jour × 44,000 kJ/kg = 160,600 kJ/jour Maintenant, nous calculons le nombre de jours pendant lesquels l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture, à partir de l'énergie totale fournie par les 100g d'uranium-235: Nombre de jours que l'uranium-235 pourrait alimenter la voiture = Énergie totale uranium / Énergie consommée par jour Nombre de jours = 6.73 x 10^9 kJ / 160,600 kJ/jour Nombre de jours ≈ 41,918 jours Ainsi, si une voiture était alimentée par 100g d'uranium-235 avec un pouvoir calorifique de 6.73 x 10^10 kJ/kg, le plein ne devrait être fait qu'après environ 41,918 jours d'utilisation – ce qui est extrêmement long par comparaison à la voiture à essence qui doit être remplie tous les 10 jours. Cela indique la densité énergétique remarquablement élevée de l'uranium-235 par rapport à l'essence."},{"prompt":"alors interpreter","completion":"L'interprétation de ces calculs révèle que l'uranium-235 possède une densité énergétique extrêmement élevée comparée à l'essence traditionnelle. Avec les chiffres fournis et le pouvoir calorifique corrigé pour l'uranium-235, voici ce que l'on peut conclure : Si une voiture qui consomme habituellement 5 litres d'essence par jour (avec un réservoir de 50 litres refait tous les 10 jours) était convertie pour fonctionner avec 100 g d'uranium-235 (avec un pouvoir calorifique de 6.73 x 10^10 kJ/kg), elle pourrait théoriquement rouler pendant environ 41,918 jours sans avoir à refaire le plein. Cela signifie que par rapport à un ravitaillement tous les 10 jours avec de l'essence, avec l'uranium-235, la voiture pourrait être utilisée pendant plus de 114 ans (en supposant qu'il n'y ait pas de jours d'arrêt et que la consommation d'énergie reste constante) avant de nécessiter un ravitaillement en énergie nucléaire. Il est important de noter que ce calcul est purement théorique et ne tient pas compte de nombreux autres facteurs tels que l'efficacité de la conversion de l'énergie nucléaire en énergie mécanique, les préoccupations en matière de sécurité, les infrastructures de support, la réglementation relative à l'utilisation de matériaux radioactifs, et le vieillissement naturel du véhicule et de ses composants. En pratique, l'utilisation de l'uranium-235 comme source d'énergie pour les véhicules n'est pas réalisable pour de multiples raisons liées à la sécurité, l'ingénierie, et la réglementation.

Based on your comment, you want to switch from using an IP camera to a local camera. If by \\"local camera\\" you mean a standard webcam or USB camera, here are a few changes you might need to make in your Python script: 1. Remove the \`import camerawrapperToF\` and \`from arena_sdk_helper import *\` imports, as they seem to be specific to the camera SDK you are using. 2. Change the \`initialize()\` function to use OpenCV's \`cv2.VideoCapture\` to capture video from your local camera.

Regular cameras do not provide depth (Z-coordinate) information, so you won't be able to directly use functions calculating depth or XYZ coordinates. If you have a different type of local camera that provides depth data, you will need to consult its SDK or API on how to retrieve and use this information. Make sure you replace the buffer access and depth conversion with direct image processing using the frames captured from the local camera (\`frame\` in the code above). If you want to perform depth estimation using a regular 2D camera, you would need to implement or use a pre-trained Deep Learning model that can estimate depth from a single image.

The third observer, being in close proximity to both entities in a broadcast ad-hoc communication network (involving complex wireless connections), is able to capture several factors related to the communication and the environmental aspects of the medium that might affect the connection. I want to develop a mathematical model to estimate/predict the state of the link without using a machine learning model. The reason for not using ML in my case is due to the lack of proper existing data for the network situation I want to examine. Therefore, I would like to know if someone can help me with this issue. Initially, I thought about using an extended Kalman filter or fuzzy logic to aid in the prediction, but since I have no experience, I would like to know if someone can provide guidance on this issue.","completion":"Developing a mathematical model to estimate or predict the state of a link in an ad-hoc communication network without relying on machine learning can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex, dynamic environments. However, some traditional methods, like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and fuzzy logic, can indeed help in such scenarios. Here's a brief overview of what these two methods entail and how they can be applied to your problem: 1. **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** The EKF is an extension of the Kalman Filter that works with nonlinear systems. It's typically used in state estimation problems in control systems and robotics. The EKF approximates the state of a nonlinear system using a series of measurements observed over time that contain noise (random variations) and other inaccuracies. For your situation: - **State Variables:** You would first need to define the state of your system, which could include factors like signal strength, noise level, bit error rate, throughput, etc. - **Prediction Step:** Model the evolution of these state variables over time (state transition model). This could be based on physical laws that govern signal propagation or empirical models. - **Update Step:** When new measurement data is available, you incorporate this information to correct your predictions and refine the estimates of the state variables. Keep in mind: - EKF requires a good understanding of the system's dynamics and the ability to replicate them with differential equations. - EKF can become computationally intensive with large state spaces. 2. **Fuzzy Logic:** Fuzzy logic is an approach that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. With fuzzy logic, you can capture vague and imprecise information to generate a deterministic output. For your situation: - **Fuzzification:** Map input variables (signal strength, noise level, etc.) to values between 0 and 1 that represent membership in fuzzy sets (like \\"Poor\\", \\"Fair\\", \\"Good\\"). - **Rule Base:** Create a set of rules that describe how the input variables will interact to lead to a particular output (link quality state). - **Inference:** Combine the fuzzified inputs according to the rule base to produce a fuzzy output. - **Defuzzification:** Convert the fuzzy output back into a crisp value, representing the predicted state of the link. Keep in mind: - Fuzzy logic is particularly useful when precise models of the system are difficult to develop. - Rule base design is often more of an art than a science and may require expert knowledge. As a starting point, consider a hybrid approach: - Collect as much domain knowledge as possible about the physical process affecting the link quality. - Develop a simple mathematical model based on this knowledge. If you have some data, even if it's not perfect, use it to validate your assumptions and tune your model; this could be informal \\"measurements\\" you observe. - As you mention, an EKF or fuzzy logic can be potential approaches. Start by simulating different scenarios to get a better grasp of their utility and limitations. Specifically for EKF: - Brush up on the basics of the Kalman filter and its extension to the nonlinear case (EKF). - Seek out resources and literature on communication link modeling and estimation. Simulation tools can be particularly helpful for this. - If the complexity of EKF becomes an issue, look into the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) or Particle Filters as possible alternatives. For fuzzy logic: - Read up on fuzzy logic system design and understand fuzzification, rule bases, inference methods, and defuzzification techniques. - Consider using software like MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox to experiment with different fuzzy system designs. Please remember that both EKF and fuzzy logic require you to define the underlying processes and relationships within your system reasonably well. This often involves a considerable amount of domain expertise and trial and error in modeling your system."},{"prompt":"I have a plant identification api built out of python.

Due to the length and complexity of the text, I can offer a summarized translation rather than a full direct translation. --- The passage describes a situation where a protective charm is given to a character named Yuan Bozhu by his sister, Yuan Wanjiao. She casually claims she had obtained the charm from a bodhisattva after much pleading and insists that Yuan Bozhu must wear it at all times due to perceived danger based on her prophetic vision. Although Yuan Bozhu does not know the contents of her prophecy, he senses her concern and takes it seriously despite initially not responding to her. Later, as Yuan Wanjiao yawns, the serious atmosphere is lightened, and she tells Yuan Bozhu to rest early in preparation for his exam the following day. Afterward, Yuan Bozhu attempts to connect with the shared soul of Yuan Wanjiao through a necromancer's \\"spiritual essence,\\" with hopes of accessing her memories and prophecies to prevent a foreseen danger that could potentially lead to their death. In the early morning, after Yuan Bozhu meditates and uses his otherworldly powers with great focus for the first time since arriving in this world, he writes down a mystifying prophecy involving changes and upheaval in the domain of spiders, the resurgence of a crimson land, an imminent revolution, and the approach of doomsday. Among these notes, he focuses on the name \\"Lin Shuanghui,\\" associated with death, a name which lacks context to Yuan Bozhu but seems to be sought after intensely by the domain of spiders. Back in the world of the living, life in Yuan Bozhu's family home goes on as normal despite the absence of Yuan Qifeng. Yuan Wanjiao enjoys gossiping with their mother, Shu Hesu, amid breakfast while the morning news advises citizens to avoid going out at night due to recent disturbances. As Yuan Bozhu leaves for his exam day at school, Yuan Wanjiao reassures her parents not to worry about him as she believes he will be safe—unbeknownst to them, the protective charm has mysteriously returned to her pocket. At school, Yuan Bozhu's teacher concludes what may be their final class meeting and motivates the students for the future, regardless of their recent exam performances. Classmates speculate on their potential new class placements as they prepare for a final class cleanup, but Yuan Bozhu remains calm and composed, certain of his steady future due to the predictability of his academic and social surroundings. --- Please note that translations, especially of literary texts, can vary greatly and may lose some of the original nuances.

You guys have the least right to complain! With your grades, you're definitely staying in our class—this cleaning is practically in your service!\\" the teacher chided. Although the comment wasn't directed at Yuan Bozhu, he felt as if he was also a beneficiary. He dutifully began to clean without complaints, responding eagerly to the class teacher’s call for cleanup—something that usually ended up being more chaotic than productive, with classmates dragging their feet even over simple tasks like moving a stool. As the cleaning progressed, conversations turned to the content of a local supernatural mysteries TV channel, which sparked debate among the students. Some were fascinated and stayed up late watching these programs, discussing footage claiming to capture a rare species transforming—a video which had been quickly removed by the network, further fueling conspiracy theories. Others, like Qin Rui, dismissed these tales as gullible fantasies, suggesting that video technology today could easily fabricate such evidence. He openly challenged the idea, proclaiming his disbelief in superpowers and daring anyone to prove him wrong. The conversation failed to reach a conclusion, leaving everyone to their cleaning tasks as Qin Rui confidently maintained his stance on the matter. His two sidekicks echoed his skepticism, asserting that belief in rare bloodline powers was superstition. Ignoring the flunkeys, the rest of the class dispersed to continue the cleanup. One sidekick approached Qin Rui to ask about accompanying him to a modeling interview he had on Saturday, while the other hinted at wanting the newest gaming console. Qin Rui, who would've previously lavished his lackeys with gifts, had come to a realization about these fair-weather friends. He no longer valued their fawning loyalty purchased with money. He dismissed them, stating he’d already found someone to accompany him. His followers were surprised and asked who it was, assuming only they were hard up for cash. “I've asked Yuan Bozhu,” Qin Rui revealed with a sense of pride. The sidekicks, recalling who Yuan Bozhu was, questioned his choice, arguing that they would be better companions for the modeling interview than a \\"dummy\\" like him who wouldn't be as sharp and responsive in a pinch. Qin Rui grew irritated at their comments, which reminded him of sycophantic court eunuchs, and reaffirmed his decision, saying he found Yuan Bozhu more reliable than them. They scoffed at his choice but did not push further. As Qin Rui approached Yuan Bozhu, who was cleaning the windows, and wrapped an arm around his shoulder, Yuan Bozhu tried to shake him off but stopped at Qin Rui’s whispered plea to save face in front of others. Yuan Bozhu relented but maintained a distance while continuing to clean. The gossip behind them suggested that Qin Rui's choice of Yuan Bozhu as a friend signaled his fall from grace, while also joking that Yuan Bozhu had suddenly come into good fortune. Qin Rui was genuinely at a loss. He'd never felt so disrespected that no one believed he could genuinely befriend someone. Yuan Bozhu reminded Qin Rui that he hadn’t actually agreed to accompany him, nor was he aware of why Qin Rui had decided on this arrangement. As he went to wash his cloth in the bathroom, Qin Rui followed him, pleading desperately. Despite his privileged background, Qin Rui wasn’t embarrassed to beg—as if it was nothing to a young master like him. Yuan Bozhu gave in after being unable to endure Qin Rui’s incessant pleading and asked for the interview address. Qin Rui, caught off-guard, hastily replied with the location. The interview was set to be at the nearby Xiyang Building on the city's southern central avenue."},{"prompt":"秦睿也不知掉自己為什麼激動，明明䥉泊逐就是班上一個毫不起眼㱕䀲學罷了，就算和這樣㱕人噷上朋友，也不是什麼值得驕傲㱕事兒。 但秦睿就是止不住㱕樂：“我派車去接你唄，你給我說你家地址就行。” “不㳎。” 䥉泊逐記下了明天㱕時間地點，回到教室，背上書包自己離開了。 秦睿望著他離開㱕背影，默默地糾結著：那我明天要給他發個大紅包嗎？那會不會玷污這純潔㱕友情？但䥉泊逐似㵒對他也沒有友情啊？ - 䥉泊逐今天也沒有當一個聽話㱕好弟弟。 他放學沒有回家。 而是去了林雙徊㱕住處。 沒辦法，他㱗林雙徊家下㱕結界還沒有消除。 萬一林雙徊恢復意識，發現自己出不了家門，那也是件麻煩事兒。 路過粥店㱕時候，䥉泊逐打包了一份蔬菜粥。 沒辦法，如果林雙徊完全不進食，異能也可能㳒控。 他䶓到門口㱕時候，想了想，要不要敲門。 這門半開著，敲不敲都沒影響。主要是試探林雙徊醒沒醒。 敲了，沒人應。沒醒。 䥉泊逐䶓了進去。 床上㱕林雙徊還和昨晚他䶓㱕時候一樣，睡得很安穩——腦袋也像昨晚時一樣，深深埋進一件黑色外套里。 那是䥉泊逐㱕衣服。 沒辦法，昨晚林雙徊一定要他抱著才肯睡覺。 好不容易等他睡著，把人放到床上，立刻又驚醒，鑽進懷裡，不肯離開。 䥉泊逐最後只能留下外套，林雙徊把帶有他氣息㱕衣服當作他㰴人，抱得死死㱕，一下就安分了。 粥還熱著，䥉泊逐打算叫醒林雙徊。 但他喊了幾聲，對方都沒回應，應該是陷入了比夢境更深一層㱕意識中。 但林雙徊兩天沒進食，這很危險。 䥉泊逐想了想，忽䛈伸手，把林雙徊懷裡㱕那件外套拽䶓了。 林雙徊幾㵒是瞬間睜了眼，茫䛈無措地抬頭看著他。 䥉泊逐剛開口，一個“吃”字還沒說完整，林雙徊咻㱕一下飛到他身上。 掛住了。 䥉泊逐：“……” “阿逐阿逐，終於到你了。” 林雙徊沒頭沒尾地說，“今天睡得不踏實，一會兒夢到這個，一會兒夢到那個。要夢到你還得碰運氣。” 於是䥉泊逐得以知道，林雙徊把他當夢了。 “我剛才飛了，你看到了嗎？我㱕翅膀漂不漂亮？” 林雙徊㱕心裡應該仍䛈處㱗夢境狀態，說話語無倫次，沒有前因後果。 䥉泊逐不㳎應他，只要聽著就行。 “阿逐阿逐阿逐……” 還是得應。 䥉泊逐淡淡道：“嗯。” “你是夢吧？” “嗯。” 林雙徊慢騰騰地扶著䥉泊逐㱕肩膀，忽䛈把額頭貼㱗他㱕額間，問：“夢醒了你還㱗嗎？” “不㱗。” “哦……”林雙徊有點㳒望，但好像又很能接受，“那我再睡會兒，你先不要䶓。” “吃飯。” “我不能吃飯，要吃別㱕。” “什麼？” 林雙徊說：“蟲吧。” 䥉泊逐㱕表情一言難盡。 他覺得林雙徊如果知道自己㱗說什麼，應該表情比他還要難受些。 陪林雙徊折騰了一會兒，再次㳎衣服代替了自己，把林雙徊塞進被窩。 䥉泊逐檢查了一下房間里㱕環境。 溫度有明顯㱕下降，能量波動趨於㱒緩。 䥉泊逐把屋子裡㱕東西收拾了一下，恢復到他沒來㱕樣子。 再䶓進卧室，檢查了一下林雙徊㱕高燒有沒有退。 比昨天好多了。 大概今晚一過，就會穩定下來了。 他看了一眼時間，差不多可以離開。 這時林雙徊㱗床上輕聲嘟囔了一句：“不會傳染吧？” 䥉泊逐看了一眼，不知道他又夢到了什麼。 下一刻，林雙徊睜開眼，狡黠㱕目光看䦣他，很小聲地說了句話。 連䥉泊逐都沒有聽清。 只能俯身，靠近些，再聽他說話。 “夢裡應該不會傳染㱕。” 林雙徊念念有詞地說了這麼一句話。 “什……” 㱗䥉泊逐還沒反應過來㱕時候，林雙徊忽䛈伸手，掛㱗了他㱕脖子上。 䛈後仰起頭。 㱗䥉泊逐嘴上親了一下。 緊接著整個人縮回被子里，念咒般重複著：“嗯，沒事，夢裡是不會傳染㱕。” 䥉泊逐㱗䥉地站了了將近三秒，䛈後面無表情地轉身，䶓了。 他㱕身體異於常人，不管夢裡夢外，林雙徊都不可能把高燒傳染給䥉泊逐。 但現㱗不是傳不傳染㱕事。","completion":"Qin Rui didn’t understand why he was so thrilled since Yuan Bozhu was just an unremarkable student in the class. Becoming friends with someone like that wasn't something to be proud of. Yet Qin Rui couldn't contain his happiness, \\"I'll send a car to pick you up, just give me your address.\\" \\"No need,\\" replied Yuan Bozhu, who noted down the time and place for the next day, shouldered his bag, and left the classroom on his own. Watching Yuan Bozhu's departing figure, Qin Rui wondered silently if he should give him a big red envelope tomorrow. Would that tarnish this pure friendship? But it seemed like Yuan Bozhu had no feelings of friendship towards him either. - Today, Yuan Bozhu didn't play the role of an obedient younger brother. Instead of going home after school, he went to Lin Shuanghui's place. He had no choice; the barrier he set at Lin Shuanghui's home was still in effect. It would be troublesome if Lin Shuanghui woke up and found himself unable to leave his home. Passing by a porridge shop, Yuan Bozhu packed a vegetable porridge. If Lin Shuanghui didn’t eat, his abilities could become uncontrollable. Arriving at the door, Yuan Bozhu hesitated to knock. The door was half-open, so knocking wouldn't matter much. It was more to check if Lin Shuanghui was awake. He knocked, but there was no response. Lin wasn’t awake. Yuan Bozhu went inside. Lin Shuanghui was sleeping just as peacefully on the bed as when Yuan Bozhu left him, his head buried in a black jacket—Yuan Bozhu's jacket. Last night, Lin insisted on hugging it to sleep. Eventually, Yuan Bozhu left the jacket with him, and holding onto it, Lin fell asleep peacefully. The porridge was still hot, so Yuan Bozhu decided to wake Lin up. But Lin didn’t respond, presumably trapped in a deeper consciousness than merely dreaming. Considering Lin hadn’t eaten for two days, his situation was dangerous. Yuan Bozhu thought for a moment, then pulled the jacket from Lin's arms. Lin’s eyes flew open immediately, confusedly looking up at him. Before Yuan Bozhu could fully utter the word \\"eat,\\" Lin suddenly leaped onto him, clinging on. Yuan Bozhu: \\"...\\" \\"Ah Zhu, Ah Zhu, it's finally you,\\" said Lin incoherently. \\"I didn’t sleep well, my dreams were all over the place. Dreaming of you was just luck.\\" And that’s how Yuan Bozhu realized Lin was mistaking him for a dream. \\"I just flew, did you see? Were my wings pretty?\\" Lin was still in a dreamlike state, speaking nonsensically. Yuan Bozhu didn’t bother entertaining him, just listening was enough. \\"Ah Zhu, Ah Zhu, Ah Zhu...\\" He had to answer. Yuan Bozhu simply responded, \\"Hmm.\\" \\"You're a dream, right?\\" \\"Hmm.\\" Lin slowly propped himself up and, pressing his forehead against Yuan Bozhu's, asked, \\"Will you disappear when the dream ends?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Oh...\\" Lin seemed a bit disappointed but accepting, \\"Then I'll sleep some more, don’t go yet.\\" \\"Eat first.\\" \\"I can't eat food, I need something else.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Bugs,\\" Lin declared. Yuan Bozhu's expression was indescribable. He figured if Lin knew what he was saying, he’d probably feel even worse. After some fuss, Yuan Bozhu replaced his physical presence with his jacket again and tucked Lin into bed. Checking the room, Yuan Bozhu noticed the temperature dropped and energy fluctuations calmed. He tidied up the house, leaving it as it was before his arrival. Returning to the bedroom, Yuan Bozhu checked Lin's fever, which had improved. By evening, it should stabilize. Glancing at the time, Yuan Bozhu prepared to leave. Hearing Lin mutter from the bed, \\"It won't be contagious, right?\\" Yuan Bozhu looked back, not sure what Lin was dreaming of. Lin's eyes opened again, and with a sly glance, he whispered something too soft for Yuan Bozhu to hear. Leaning in to listen, Yuan Bozhu caught Lin saying, \\"It shouldn't be contagious in a dream.\\" Before Yuan Bozhu could react, Lin reached out, wrapped his arms around his neck, and kissed him gently on the lips, then quickly retreated back under the covers, chanting like a spell, \\"Yeah, it’s fine, it won't be contagious in a dream.\\" Yuan Bozhu stood still for nearly three seconds, then emotionlessly turned and left. His body being different from ordinary people’s, Lin's fever couldn't be transmitted to him, whether in dreams or reality. But now it wasn't about contagion at all."},{"prompt":"林雙徊是㱗半夜點醒來㱕。 徹底㱕醒來。 他㱕高燒已經退去, 但渾身骨頭酸軟無力，關節處總有種抻不開㱕局促。 大概是躺了太久了，感到一陣口乾舌燥, 就走出客廳去，從柜子里拿出一瓶新㱕礦泉水，擰開蓋兒就咕咚咕咚灌了幾口。 冷水刺激下，腦子開始逐漸找䋤理智。 某個畫面竄出來, 嚇了林雙徊一跳。 他頓時被水嗆了好幾口，咳得眼睛都紅了，最後撐㱗牆邊，一臉㳓無可戀㱕表情緩緩直起身。 他幹了什麼不得了㱕大䛍？ 過了有十幾㵑鐘, 那種令人頭皮發麻手腳發軟㱕窒息感才逐漸褪去。 林雙徊給自己做了充足㱕心理準備, 幾個深呼吸后, 他抬頭環顧四周。 沙發上㱕校服還㱗, 䭼好。 茶几上㱕書㰴仍然凌亂，䭼好。 廚房裡沒有㳎過㱕燒水壺和打碎㱕玻璃杯，䭼好。 整個屋子沒有原泊逐這個人, 䭼好。 是夢。 沒問題。 林雙徊自信滿滿地點點頭。 既然是夢，就沒什麼好怕㱕了——就算他纏著原泊逐一定要抱著他睡覺，就算他連告白都還沒做過就親了人——那也沒關係, 反正都是夢。 但莫名㱕，覺得心裡空落落㱕。 雖然知道不可能, 但有那麼一瞬，林雙徊還是希望它真㱕發㳓過。 他嘆了一聲氣, 䋤味著自己㱕夢，然後昂首挺胸地拿了換洗衣服去浴室沖了個熱水澡。 洗掉一身黏糊糊㱕汗，神清氣爽。 林雙徊站㱗鏡子前開始審視自己。 他知道, 這一次㱕高燒不太一樣。 他㱕身體發㳓了一些說不清道不明㱕變化。 具體是什麼變了，林雙徊還不能確定，細說起來大概就是：他覺得自己變輕了，走路更快了，視線變得清晰，聽力也更好了。 但這些都是䭼細微㱕變化，如果林雙徊自己不說，別人就不會發現。 䀴頭髮和指甲莫名其妙地又長長了不少，這就需要林雙徊稍微整理一下。 “嘶……”林雙徊盯著鏡子，忽然倒抽一口冷氣。 然後猛地湊近一看。 該死，他㱕眼睫䲻掉色了。 他又黑又長㱕眼睫䲻現㱗變成了一片金紅——字面意思，又金又紅，他也不知道這詭異㱕顏色還能有什麼㳍法。 拔了吧。 林雙徊想。 再次面對自己㱕改變，他㱕情緒非常穩定。 和周遭㱕空氣溫度一樣穩定。 不知道是因為接受了自己不是人類㱕䛍實，還是因為，夢裡㱕飼養員給了他一種莫名㱕安全感。 林雙徊已經不那麼害怕看見自己㱕異樣。 他真㱕開始尋找鑷子，打算拔掉自己㱕眼睫䲻。 反正只要他㱗走出這個屋子㱕時候，變得和平時沒有區別，那就不會有人發現他㱕秘密。 林雙徊已經想好了，能瞞一天是一天。瞞到無法再瞞㱕時候就破罐子破摔。 這和他過去㱕㳓活沒什麼差別。 走一步看一步，走到無路可走了就原地躺下。 這世界無法讓一個㰴就對未來不抱希望㱕人，再次失望。 鑷子，剪㥕，準備完畢。 林雙徊把它們拿㱗手裡，卻㱗轉身要走出卧室㱕瞬間，愣了一下。 那是什麼？ 他脖子以極其緩慢㱕速度，轉到了床㱕方向，看過去。 一件黑色外套。 林雙徊對自己㱕衣櫃有什麼衣服一清二楚。 他可不記得自己什麼時候買過一件，這麼，款式單調，顏色單調，又尺碼過大㱕外套。 不是他㱕。 那是誰㱕？ 短短几㵑鐘，林雙徊㱕心情經歷了一個過山車般㱕起伏。 他放下剪㥕和鑷子。 心裡清楚這意味著什麼，自己現㱗應該感到緊張或䭾驚慌。 但都沒有。 下意識抬手抵住唇角，似乎㱗認真䋤味某種觸覺。隨後，林雙徊笑了起來。 心情前所未有㱕好。","completion":"Lin Shuanghui woke up in the middle of the night, completely alert. His fever had subsided, but his body felt achingly weak and tight, possibly from lying down too long. He felt extremely thirsty and made his way to the living room for some bottled water, which he gulped down vigorously. The cold water stimulated his brain, and he started to regain his senses when a certain image flashed through his mind, causing him to choke on his drink, cough violently, and lean on the wall with a look of despair. He wondered what terrible thing he might've done during his feverish state. It took him about fifteen minutes to recover from the overwhelming sensation. Lin prepared himself mentally, took several deep breaths, and looked around the house. Everything was exactly as he had left it: the school uniform on the sofa, the books on the coffee table, the unattended kettle in the kitchen, and most importantly, Yuan Bozhu was nowhere to be found. It was just a dream—nothing to worry about. Lin reassured himself with a confident nod. Since it was only a dream, even if he had clung to Yuan Bozhu and kissed him without confessing his feelings—none of it mattered. Nevertheless, there was an odd emptiness in his heart. There was a moment when Lin wished it was all real. Sighing, Lin tried to savor the dream and then headed to the bathroom to take a hot shower, feeling refreshed afterwards. Standing before the mirror, he inspected himself. He knew this fever was different; it had induced subtle changes in his body—making him lighter, faster, and improving his sight and hearing. If he didn't speak of it, no one would notice the changes. Noting that his hair and nails had grown inexplicably long, Lin decided they needed trimming. Suddenly, he inhaled sharply at his reflection—his eyelashes had changed color. His dark, long lashes had turned to a golden-red hue, a bizarre color that he had no idea how to deal with. Pulling them out seemed like the only solution. While facing these changes, Lin felt remarkably calm, like the air temperature around him. Whether it was because he had accepted the fact that he was not human or because the dream had given him an unexplainable sense of security, Lin no longer feared his own abnormalities. He was ready to pluck his eyelashes; as long as he looked normal when he left the house, no one would discover his secret. Lin had resolved to keep his secret for as long as possible, and when it became impossible to hide, he would face the consequences. After all, this approach wasn't very different from how he'd lived his life so far—just taking one day at a time, lying down when there was nowhere left to go. After all, a world couldn't disappoint someone who had no hopes for the future. He prepared the tweezers and scissors but paused as he turned to leave the bedroom. Something caught his eye—a black jacket laid on the bed. Lin knew his wardrobe inside out and was certain he didn’t own such a simple, monotone, over-sized jacket. It wasn't his—that meant someone else's. Lin's emotions surged like a roller coaster in just a few minutes as the realization hit him. He should feel nervous or panicked, but he didn't. Subconsciously touching his lips as if savoring a sensation, he soon began to smile, his mood lifting like never before."},{"prompt":"answer with 80 to 110 words as you are in a speaking IELTS test.

These friendships are rooted in pure, shared experiences from a time when life was arguably simpler and more carefree. Keeping in touch with childhood friends can provide a sense of continuity and comfort that is hard to replicate with newer acquaintances. Moreover, they remind us of our past dreams, challenges we’ve overcome, and they often provide a unique perspective on who we are and how we've grown.

I do believe it's essential to maintain childhood friendships because they're like emotional anchors. They remind us of where we've come from and the journey we've taken.

We've grown up together, and that shared history means we have a profound understanding of each other's personalities, quirks, and character. This understanding often results in a unique level of trust that can be hard to find in friendships formed later in life. Moreover, the longer the friendship lasts, the more this common understanding and mutual trust deepen, allowing for a very special bond to develop. This bond can often lead to a sense of belonging and acceptance which is truly invaluable.

Reliability is crucial because you need to know that your friend will be there for you through your highs and lows. Trustworthiness is another essential trait because a good friend keeps your confidences and acts with your best interests at heart. Compassion is also important, as a good friend empathizes with your struggles and offers support without judgment.

Secondo l'articolo originale di Okun, la relazione era piuttosto empirica e indicativa, e nelle sue versioni più semplici è spesso espressa attraverso una delle due forme seguenti: 1. **La legge di Okun (in forma differenziale):** Si stima che per ogni punto percentuale di cui il tasso di crescita reale del PIL supera il tasso di crescita potenziale (crescita tendenziale), la disoccupazione dovrebbe scendere di circa 0.5 punti percentuali. 2. **La legge di Okun (in forma di gap):** Se il PIL effettivo si trova al di sotto del potenziale del PIL (c'è un \\"gap\\" di output), si verifica un aumento della disoccupazione. A grandi linee, un aumento del gap di output del 2% è associato a un aumento di circa 1 punto percentuale nel tasso di disoccupazione. Il coefficiente di Okun varia da paese a paese e nel tempo, poiché è influenzato da vari fattori strutturali dell'economia, come la flessibilità del mercato del lavoro, l'età media della forza lavoro, la formazione della forza lavoro, la politica industriale e tanti altri. È importante notare che la legge di Okun è più una regola empirica piuttosto che una relazione precisa e garantita; le stime e i rapporti possono differire in base al periodo e alla metodologia di misurazione. Inoltre, la legge di Okun è utile per le previsioni a breve termine ma non è adatta per previsioni di lungo periodo poiché non tiene conto di possibili cambiamenti strutturali nell'economia."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

Возможности экотехнологий для снижения техногенного воздействия на природные экосистемы. (сократи информацию для конспекта, то есть основные определения) Мир без отходов! В основе этой концепции максимальное снижение отходов. Речь идет об уменьшении количества бытового мусора, промышленного твердого мусора, жидких и газообразных отходов, то есть комплекс всех выбросов, которые убивают нашу планету. Особо остро стоит проблемы с мусором, который ежедневно появляется в результате жизнедеятельности людей. Возможности для изменения ситуации открыты перед каждым человеком, достаточно лишь реализовать их в своей жизни. Тогда могут быть достигнуты цели, стоящие перед человечеством (слайд 1): чистая вода, воздух и земля; сохранение ресурсов; самовыражение и стиль; хорошее здоровье; практичность и экономия; забота о природе. Рассмотрим проблемы накопление твердых бытовых отходов (ТБО). Каждый день миллионы людей выбрасывают тонны мусора. Во время праздников его количество увеличивается в несколько раз. Коробки, упаковки, красивые подарочные пакеты, сами подарки заполняют мусорные контейнеры. Ненужная еда разлагается – на неприятный запах сбегаются бездомные кошки и собаки, крысы. Мусор вывозится на свалки, куда часто попадают и отходы производства: брак, шины, детали машин. Такую ситуацию сегодня можно увидеть практически в любом городе, и с каждым годом она принимает все более ужасающие масштабы. Начиная с 2020 года проблема с мусором удвоилась, в связи с пандемией, возникли дополнительные проблемы с мелким мусором, например с масками. Количество твердых бытовых отходов (ТБО) в расчете на одного человека увеличивается примерно на 1-4 % в год, а по массе – на 0,2-0,4 % и в настоящее время составляет: в благоустроенных зданиях – 160-190, в неблагоустроенных – 600-700 (рис.1). В городах США образуется ежегодно около 200 млн. т отходов и ожидается увеличение их количества на 20 %. В значительно меньшей по размеру Японии количество образующихся бытовых отходов превышает 72 млн. т ежегодно. Количество образующихся бытовых отходов в Москве составляет примерно 270 кг на одного человека в год и продолжает увеличиваться. В США на каждого жителя приходится 715 кг мусора в год, в Швеции – 480 кг. По приблизительным подсчетам, на одного россиянина приходится около 2 куб. м отходов в год. В переводе на вес это составит до 400 кг ТБО. То есть в день россиянин вырабатывает 1100 г мусора. Из этого количества примерно 17% занимает стекло и 20% — бумажная и картонная продукция. В большинстве стран мира темпы образования отходов растут. В дальнейшем эта тенденция сохранится, так как в условиях мировой тенденции роста населения и урбанизации ежегодное производство отходов по прогнозам, с 2016 по 2050 год увеличится на 70 % и достигнет 3,40 млрд тонн (рис 2,3). Следует обратить внимание, что состав ТБО существенно отличается в зависимости от уровня развития стран и, соответственно, уровня благосостояния населения, проживающего на этой территории. В состав ТБО, что только не входит, в странах с низким уровнем доходов более 55% это органический материал, а странах с высоким уровнем дохода 25% бумага и картон, 20% пластик, органических веществ около 35%. Как мы видим вокруг себя особенно много пластика, у которого период жизни достаточно большой. Чем ниже уровень населения, тем хуже решается проблемы с утилизацией мусора. В странах с низким уровнем дохода, часть мусора выбрасывается даже не на свалки, а просто на улицу или на стихийные свалки и о переработке мусора речи нет. Утилизация мусора в таких странах приблизительно 35 % , по сравнению со странами с высоким уровнем дохода, где утилизация составляет почти 100%. Влияние мусора на здоровье людей и окружающую среду. Тонны отходов вывозятся на полигоны, становясь глобальной проблемой. Годами, подвергаясь воздействию осадков, солнечных лучей, они начинают разлагаться. Процесс вызывает образование газов, которые испаряются, загрязняя атмосферу вредными веществами. Канцерогенные соединения, как бензапирены, формальдегиды, тяжелые металлы копятся, соединяются с водой, выпадают кислотными дождями. Они разрушают нервную систему, становятся причиной серьезных болезней. Образующийся газ способен к самовозгоранию. Постоянно тлеющие свалки, с большим количеством отходов резины и полимеров, разносят по окрестностям ядовитый дым с частицами диоксинов. Они быстро всасываются и накапливаются организмом. В процессе разложения мусора так же образуется сероводород – вещество, которое, по свидетельству ученых, увеличивает частоту и тяжесть респираторных заболеваний, провоцирует рак легких. Другой момент, вызывающий беспокойство, связан с попаданием на свалки лекарств, средств бытовой химии. Химикаты достигают уровня грунтовых вод и отравляют землю, животных и растения. Дети, рожденные недалеко от мест хранения и переработки мусора, имеют маленький вес. Часто у них наблюдаются врожденные проблемы. По мнению ученых, это результат воздействия диоксида азота, а также невидимых глазу частиц, попадающих в воздух. Методы переработки и утилизации ТБО складирование, сжигание, компостирование. 1.Сбор и удаление ТБО. Первым этапом очистки территории является повсеместный ежедневный сбор отходов, для чего в домовладениях устанавливают мусоропроводы и (или) мусоросборники. Тип и емкость мусоросборников зависит от количества накапливающихся отходов, этажности застройки, а также от способа загрузки и вывоза мусора. Наиболее распространенными являются контейнеры емкостью 110-120, 210-220 и 500-600 л. Их целесообразно размещать по нескольку штук на территории двора или квартала. Все твердые отходы вывозятся специализированным транспортом в специально отведенные места для обезвреживания и утилизации не реже трех раз в неделю, а в крупных городах ежедневно. На данный момент самым актуальным в решении с ТБО – раздельный сбор! 2. Обезвреживание и переработка ТБО. В настоящее время ТБО городов свозятся на полигоны, где складируются на грунт с расчетом на их последующую минерализацию. Это наиболее простой метод – складирование. Полигоны, размещаемые за пределами населенных пунктов, - это природоохранные сооружения, обеспечивающие защиту от загрязнения атмосферы, почвы, поверхностных и грунтовых вод, препятствующие распространению болезнетворных микроорганизмов. При выборе участка для устройства полигона ТБО учитывают климатические, почвенные и другие условия. Для полигона ТБО выбирают ровную местность, исключающую возможность смыва атмосферными осадками части отходов и загрязнения ими прилегающих земельных площадей, открытых водоемов, почвы расположенных близко населенных пунктов. Санитарно - защитная зона между полигоном и жилой застройкой должна составлять не менее 100 м. В результате микробиологических процессов, проходящих в отходах на свалках, образуется биогаз. Биогаз обладает значительным энергетическим потенциалом (содержание метана в нем достигает 44-66 %). Он может быть использован в теплосиловых установках, а в очищенном виде – в газовых турбинах. В мире в настоящее время эксплуатируется 146 установок по получению и использованию биогаза, получаемого в результате анаэробного окисления органических веществ на свалках городских отходов. 3.Промышленные методы обработки ТБО. Усовершенствованные свалки не являются радикальным решением проблемы обезвреживания и утилизации ТБО. На некоторых мусороперерабатывающих заводах осуществляется промышленная переработка ТБО в сельскохозяйственное удобрение – компост. Бытовые отходы перегружают в бункер-накопитель, откуда грейферным краном подаются в загрузочные воронки, затем – во вращающиеся барабанные грохоты, где разделяются на две фракции – мелкую и крупную. Мелкая фракция ТБО проходит через дробилку и поступает в биотермические башни, где за четверо суток в результате аэробного процесса бытовой мусор превращается в компост (биохимическая переработка, компостирование). Крупная фракция поступает в котлы и сжигается при температуре 800-1000 °С. Вырабатываемый котлами пар под давлением 13 атм. с температурой 250 °С используется для нужд завода, а его избыток – другими предприятиями. Магнитными сепараторами из поступающих отходов извлекают металлы, которые пакетируют и реализуют как вторичное сырье. Компост, получаемый на мусороперерабатывающих заводах, используют в качестве органического удобрения (урожайность некоторых культур может повышаться на 20-30 %). 4.Термические методы обезвреживания ТБО. Обезвреживание ТБО осуществляется также методом сжигания. Из бункера-накопителя отходы подают в загрузочные воронки, а затем – топки котлов, где сжигают на специальной решетке при температуре 800-1000 °С без дополнительной подачи топлива. Образующийся при сжигании шлак транспортируют в специальное помещение. Магнитный сепаратор, установленный на транспортере, извлекает черный металлолом, который пакетируется и реализуется как вторичное сырье. Дымовые газы очистку в электрофильтрах (степень очистки 96-98 %). Вырабатываемый котлами пар под давлением 13 атм. и с температурой 194 °С используется для нужд завода, а его избыток направляется в бойлерную установку для нагревания сетевой воды городской системы теплоснабжения. Наряду с проблемой ТБО, не менее актуальны проблемы с промышленными отходами. Но в связи, с тем, что промышленные отходы получаются от определенного производства и состав отходов, по сравнению с ТБО, известен. Критерием определения целесообразности переработки отходов в местах их образования является количество и степень их использования в производстве. Большая доля в общем объеме твердых отходов принадлежит металлическим отходам. Вторичные ресурсы металлов складываются из лома (43 %) и отходов (57 %). Основные операции первичной обработки металлических отходов – сортировка, разделка и механическая обработка. Пакетирование отходов организуется на предприятиях, на которых образуется 50 т и более отходов в месяц. На предприятиях, где образуется большое количество данных отходов, организуются специальные участки для утилизации вторичных металлов. Отходы древесины широко используются для изготовления различных товаров, главным образом методом прессования. Переработанные древесные отходы применяются в производстве древесно-стружечных плит. Переработку промышленных отходов производят на специальных полигонах, предназначенных для централизованного сбора, обезвреживания и захоронения токсичных отходов промышленных предприятий, НИИ и учреждений. Стратегии управления отходами в развитых странах. Анализ способов обработки отходов: рециркуляция, захоронение, сжигание Повышение темпов рециркуляции и снижение темпов захоронения отходов четко взаимосвязаны. Как правило, захоронение отходов сокращается гораздо быстрее, чем рост рециркуляции, поскольку стратегии управления отходами в основном переходят от захоронения отходов к сочетанию рециркуляции и сжигания, а в некоторых случаях и механико–биологической обработки. Рассмотрим ситуацию в Европе. В Европе уже много лет реализуется экологическая политика по работе с ТБО. В декабре 2005 года Европейская комиссия опубликовала сообщение о разработке стратегии по предотвращению образования и переработке отходов. Цель стратегии заключается в снижении воздействия на окружающую среду, связанного с ресурсами. Политика и цели в области отходов, установленные на уровне ЕС, включают минимальные требования к управлению определенными видами отходов. Основные рекомендациями по обращению с ТБО основаны на принципах иерархии управления отходами от неконтролируемого захоронения до предотвращения образования отходов. Давайте посмотрим на примере конкретных стран. Германия. В 2013 году разработана «Федеральная программа по предотвращению отходов»10 , которая успешно применяется на практике. Кроме того Федеральным министерством окружающей среды, охраны природы и ядерной безопасности (BMU) регулярно обновляется «Концепции по предотвращению отходов» (последняя выпущена в ноябре 2019 года) . В концепции выделены следующие аспекты : • Ценим продукты и предпочитаем ремонтировать, а не выбрасывать. • Повторное использование вместо выбрасывания. • Экологический дизайн – снижение воздействия на окружающую среду. • Использование рыночных стимулов для предотвращения отходов. • Одноразовые сумки. Упаковка. США. Ежегодный объем ТБО в США составляет около 260 млн тонн в год (1-е место в мире). В целом США пока перерабатывают около трети общего объема ТБО, 13 % сжигается на электростанциях, работающих на этих отходах, а больше половины отправляется на разные захоронения. Основные усилия властей страны в этой области направлены на сокращение первичных объемов ТБО. Японии. Япония пошла по пути развития инфраструктуры по сжиганию ТБО. Это связано с территорией: численность населения сопоставима с Россией, а площадь страны в 45 раз меньше. В Японии захоронению подлежат всего 5 % бытового мусора, остальное отравляется на переработку или сжигание (до 70 % от всего объема ТКО). Так как значительная часть мусоросжигательных заводов располагается в черте городов, применяемые технологии, обеспечивающие горение с температурой более 1200 °C и самая совершенная система фильтрации, позволяют свести вредные выбросы практически к нулю. Поэтому Япония – «передовик» в мире по количеству МСЗ – их более 1900. Бесперебойная работа МСЗ обеспечивается, в том числе, очень строгой дисциплиной среди населения по предварительной сортировке мусора. В домах установлены до 40 контейнеров для разных видов ТКО (для различных видов бумаги, пластика, металлов, стекла и т. п.). Даже пластиковые стаканчики из-под йогурта японец обязан вымыть перед тем, как выбросит. При этом наиболее токсичные отходы в Японии не утилизируют, а вывозят к соседям на Филиппины. Еще один японский способ утилизации мусора – строительство так называемых «мусорных островов». Около 250 км2 в Токийском заливе стали сушей за счет переработанной бумаги и оставшегося после сжигания отходов пепла. Такие территории используются под элитное жилье, парки, металлургические заводы и аэропорты Китай. До 2018 года Китай был крупнейшим импортером мусора в мире. С 1992 года Китай импортировал до 45 % мировых пластиковых отходов, главным образом из развитых стран: 95 % перерабатываемого пластика из ЕС и 70 % из США отправлялось на пустых контейнеровозах обратно в КНР для вторичного использования. В 2016 году на долю Китая пришлось 56 % общемирового импорта пластиковых отходов на сумму 3,7 млрд долларов. В январе 2018 года Китай ввел новые ограничения на импорт мусора для дальнейшей переработки. Причины – экологические. Частные предприятия по переработке мусора, помимо того, что привозят отходы из других стран, часто не соблюдают экологические требования по утилизации. Нередко то, что не поддается переработке, оказывается на несанкционированных свалках. Рост потребления местным населением и, как следствие, увеличение количества ТКО, привело к необходимости принять меры по утилизации уже внутренних отходов. Основная ставка делается на мусоросжигательные заводы. В 2020 доля сжигаемого мусора составила 50 %. Стратегии управления отходами в России На сегодняшний день большая часть отходов в России захоранивается, т. е. сваливается на открытых полигонах и свалках, часто даже не оборудованных средствами специальной защиты от загрязнения почвы, водной среды и прилегающих территорий . Официально считается, что в стране более 14 700 санкционированных мест размещения отходов, которые занимают территорию около 4 млн га, что сопоставимо с территорией Швейцарии или Нидерландов. Под размещение все возрастающих объемов ТБО ежегодно выделяется 400 000 гектаров земли, что эквивалентно по размеру территории городов Москвы и Санкт-Петербурга. При этом существуют еще и нелегальные свалки, количество которых по разным оценкам варьируется от 10 тыс. до нескольких сотен тысяч. Помимо вывода значительных земельных ресурсов из хозяйственного оборота полигоны загрязняют атмосферу, поверхностные слои почвы, подземные воды и грунт, негативно влияют на растительный и животный мир, ухудшают качество жизни населения близлежащих территорий. Из-за отсутствия системы раздельного сбора и утилизации отходов, содержащих токсичные компоненты, растут масштабы загрязнения окружающей среды опасными веществами. Возможности экотехнологий для снижения техногенного воздействия на природные экосистемы. «Ноль отходов» — новая философия 21 века. Это выбор вещей, созданных для долгой и счастливой жизни, а не для свалки. Популярность такого представления о мире растет — люди стремятся уменьшить мусорный след и сделать свою жизнь более осмысленной, практичной и здоровой. Жизнь в стиле «ноль отходов» — это цивилизованный способ иметь все необходимое, не уничтожая планету. Система управления сбором мусора По данным WWF, эффективное управление отходами может сократить выбросы парниковых газов на 10-15%, а переработка пластиковой упаковки может экономить до 120 млрд в год. В настоящее время большинство операций по сбору коммунальных отходов сосредоточены на регулярном вывозе придомовых контейнеров по расписанию. Такой подход неэффективен, ведь зачастую контейнеры могут быть либо полупустыми, либо переполненными. В результате операторы по утилизации отходов тратят лишнее топливо (в случае полупустых контейнеров) или вынужденно совершают повторный выезд (в случае переполненности). Интеллектуальные решения по сбору отходов способны отслеживать уровни отходов и обеспечивать оптимизацию маршрута и оперативную аналитику. такие решения позволяют снизить эксплуатационные расходы. Общий набор элементов в большинстве интеллектуальных систем сбора отходов включает в себя: • датчики, которые контролируют уровень заполнения и другие показатели (температуры, влажности и т.д.); • беспроводные модули для передачи данных; • программное обеспечение для управления данными. На каждый контейнер для отходов монтируются датчики, оповещающие о его наполненности. Датчики, подключенные к беспроводным сетям связи и использующие аккумуляторы или солнечную энергию в качестве источников питания, отправляют информацию на сервер платформы анализа отходов о необходимости опорожнить бак. Диспетчеры, отвечающие за вывоз мусора, могут просмотреть информацию в мобильном приложении самостоятельно или дождаться SMS или push-уведомлений на смартфон, планшет, электронного письма и т.д. Данные анализируются аналитической платформой, а результаты работы по сбору мусора отображаются в виде графиков и таблиц. На основе исторических данных и интеллектуальных алгоритмов платформа способна представить прогнозы уровня заполнения для дальнейшей оптимизации операций. Совокупность баков с питанием датчиков от солнечной энергии и аналитической платформы может уменьшить эксплуатационные расходы сбора отходов до 80%. Специальный софт в диспетчерской ищет оптимальный маршрут с учетом дорожной ситуации для каждой мусороуборочной машины. Используя исторические данные, система может прогнозировать заполненность каждого бака, оптимальные маршруты и периоды для его уборки. Достоинства такой реализации решения несколько: • оперативное обслуживание контейнеров по необходимости или запросу горожан через специальное приложение; • оптимизация рабочего графика сотрудников; • минимизация расхода топлива и “холостых” выездов; • оптимизация парка спецтехники за счет оптимального графика вывоза мусора; • сокращение операционных и эксплуатационных расходов. На этапе сортировки мусора используются современные интеллектуальные информационные системы. На движущемся конвейере оптические сканеры в инфракрасном и видимых спектрах распознают типы объектов, выделяя из потока отходов стекло, бумагу, металл, полимеры и т.д. Новейшие разработки позволяют обнаружить несколько сотен типов материалов. Благодаря сортировке мусора из каждого вида отходов можно получать разные продукты. Например, из органических отходов, используя специальных червей получать компост. Из отходов производства биодизеля –дрова для камина. Правильно организованные полигоны ТБО и ТПО позволяют получать биогаз. Макулатура позволяет сохранить более 41 миллионов деревьев и т.д. Идеи Zero Waste позволяют предлагать и реализовать экотехнологии для снижения техногенного воздействия на природные экосистемы. В качестве примера рассмотрим 15 экологических изобретений, которые помогут спасти окружающую среду. 1. Ручки из переработанных материалов и экологичные чернила. Сегодня ручки делают из картонных упаковок Тетра Пак и пластиковых бутылок. Но, пожалуй, самые необычные – это ручки из отходов пшеничного производства, корпус которых сделан с добавлением соломы и отрубей. Проблему для экологии представляют не только обычные пластиковые ручки, но и чернила. Их часто производят с добавлением продуктов нефтепереработки. Но и здесь бывают безопасные решения. Air-Ink – чернила, сделанные из загрязнённого воздуха из выхлопной автомобильной трубы. Для получения газов и сажи на трубу крепится сборщик. Потом в лаборатории из этого материала выделяют очищенный пигмент: для 30 мл чернил нужно, чтобы автомобильный двигатель работал 45 минут. Первые образцы таких маркеров раздали творческим людям – дизайнерам и художникам. 2. Экологичная обувь Adidas сотрудничает с организацией Parley for the Oceans, которая спасает океан от загрязнения. В коллекциях бренда есть кроссовки из пластика, собранного на побережье. Сначала мусор перерабатывают в волокна, а потом из них плетут ткань, которая становится основой для верхней части обуви. По такому же принципу в Adidas делают экологичные купальники и спортивные футболки. Кстати, некоторые марки идут в экоматериалах ещё дальше: Osklen делает обувь из остатков лососевой кожи, Matt&Nat использует старые велосипедные шины для подошв, а Bourgeois Boheme укрепляет каблуки перемолотым известняком. 3. Экокожа из растений Ирландский дизайнер Кармен Хиеса запустила в Филиппинах производство экологичной кожи на основе ананасовых волокон. Материал Pinatex, похожий на войлок, разрабатывали пять лет, а теперь из него делают сумки, верхнюю одежду, обувь, пояса и ремешки для часов. Среди активных закупщиков такой кожи – Puma и Hugo Boss. А филиппинцы получают дополнительный заработок, ведь теперь фермеры знают, что делать с ананасовыми листьями, которые раньше просто гнили. 4. Вещи из бочек для виски Обычно крепкий алкоголь выдерживают в ёмкостях из дерева. Чтобы потом бочки не валялись без дела, их придумали перерабатывать и делать массу полезных вещей. Например, Original Grain производит часы. А на часть средств, вырученных от продажи такого экологического аксессуара, компания сажает в Сенегале плодовые деревья. 5. Детская мебель из старых игрушек Экотехнологии часто базируются на переработке пластика, но речь обычно идёт о бутылках и пищевых упаковках. Голландская компания EcoBirdy пошла дальше и решила собирать сломанные игрушки в детских садах. Так ей удалось переработать 25 тонн игрушек, из которых делают мебель для малышей: столы, стулья, шкафы и лампы в форме зверюшек. 6. Автоматы для кормления котов и собак Аппараты по приёму пластиковой или стеклянной тары давно есть в разных странах. Но именно в Турции, где все обожают животных, компания Pugedon разработала устройства по сбору мусора, которые в обмен на бутылку высыпают в миску 20 граммов корма. Работают такие автоматы на солнечной энергии. 7. Душ, который экономит воду Новые экологические технологии позволяют каждому поучаствовать в сбережении ресурсов. Так, стартап Nebia в США представил душевую систему, которая экономит до 70% воды в день. Разработкой занимались инженеры NASA и Tesla, а инвестировала в проект компания Apple. Секрет в том, что вместо обычной водяной струи из душевой насадки распыляются капли. В результате за минуту вы тратите лишь 2–3 литра воды. Капельки быстрее покрывают кожу и смывают с неё грязь. Так вы не просто моетесь, а оказываетесь в облаке тёплого тумана. 8. Дома из конопли Костробетон – строительный материал на основе стеблей сельскохозяйственной конопли. У него хорошая тепло- и звукоизоляция, высокая стойкость к гниению и защита от насекомых и крыс. Из конопли делают как целые коттеджи, так и небольшие хранилища для овощей и фруктов. Несколько лет назад на рынке появился новый костробетон Hempcrete от команды Массачусетского института и дизайнера Чада Нутсена. Материал поглощает из атмосферы углекислый газ, из-за чего известь в составе конопляных блоков кальцинируется, а значит, дом со временем становится прочнее. 9. Газетная древесина Дизайнер Мики Мейер из Нидерландов предложил с пользой применять непроданные тиражи газет, ради печати которых вырубают тонны лесов. Он придумал Newspaper Wood – спрессованный материал на основе бумаги и органического клея. Из такой древесины выпиливают мебель и интерьерные украшения. Изделия можно спокойно сверлить, лакировать и шлифовать. Чтобы материал напоминал дерево с его оригинальным рисунком, газеты склеивают изгибами, помещая под пресс. 10. Капсула Мунди Под таким загадочным названием скрывается не что иное, как экологичный гроб. Использование деревьев в ритуальных целях сокращает долю лесов на земле. Поэтому дизайнеры из Италии Анна Чителли и Рауль Бретцель предложили создавать для захоронения людей органические капсулы из древесной стружки. Идея кокона в том, что необычный гроб вместе с телом покойного послужит питательной основой для дерева, которое можно высадить сверху. Породу дерева человек сможет выбрать ещё при жизни, а в первое время за саженцем будут ухаживать близкие умершего. Если эта идея станет популярной, кладбище превратится в экологичную зелёную зону. 11. Многоразовая пищевая плёнка Фермер из Вермонта Сара Кек, задумавшись об ущербе от пластика, разработала натуральный упаковочный материал. Bee’s Wrap – хлопчатобумажная плёнка с пчелиным воском, маслом жожоба и древесной смолой. Под тёплыми руками этот узорчатый материал становится пластичным и принимает форму любого продукта. Хранить в плёнке можно всё, кроме мяса. 12. Умный термостат Термостат Nest – одно из самых популярных устройств в США и Канаде с 2011 года. С его помощью экономят тепло в доме. Для управления гаджетом достаточно скачать приложение на смартфон, а потом задать нужную температуру. Термостат запоминает ваши предпочтения в разное время года и суток, а ещё будет формировать отчёты о потреблении энергии. Новые модели Nest составляют расписание температуры в доме, автоматически отключают после вашего ухода кондиционеры, вентиляторы, увлажнители и сообщают об ошибках в системе отопления. 13. Съедобная вода в пузырьках Чтобы сократить производство пластиковой упаковки, лондонская компания Rocks Lab запустила проект Ooho!. Идея разработки – в безвкусной, но съедобной и экологичной упаковке для воды. Разлагается такой шарик, если его не съесть, за 4–6 недель. При создании пузырьков используются бурые водоросли с добавлением хлорида кальция. Жидкость сначала замораживают, а потом наносят на ледяную поверхность упаковочную смесь. Даже когда вода разморозилась, она сохраняет заданную форму, поэтому её можно брать с собой. Объём таких шариков от 50 мл. 14. Пластиковые дороги Голландская компания PlasticRoad делает модули из переработанного пластика и собирает из них дороги. Это проще и дешевле, чем из асфальта. Модули мало весят и легко крепятся друг к другу, а внутри таких дорог прокладывают все нужные коммуникации. Срок годности модулей – несколько десятков лет, а потом их можно разобрать и снова переработать. 15. Ловушка для пластика в океане и «Морское ведро» Ещё одно изобретение от голландцев, которое помогает собирать мусор в океане. Это специальная ловушка U-образной формы с поплавками.

The \`ENOTCONN\` error signifies that the socket is not connected. The usual flow of a client socket interaction in a blocking mode goes like this: 1. The socket is created with the \`socket\` system call. 2. The \`connect\` system call is performed to establish a connection to a server. 3. Once connected, data can be sent with \`send\` or \`write\`, and received with \`recv\` or \`read\`. You would expect to get \`ENOTCONN\` during a \`send\`, \`recv\`, \`read\`, or \`write\` operation in the following cases: - If you try to send or receive data on a socket that was never connected with \`connect\`. - If you are working with a connected-type socket (like \`SOCK_STREAM\`) and the connection has been broken. This can happen, for example, if the other end has closed the connection, and you did not check for the zero return code or an error from \`recv\` or \`read\`, which indicates that the peer shut down the connection (like when \`recv\` returns 0). However, after the \`connect\` system call, you could theoretically encounter \`ENOTCONN\` in the following situations: - If you're working with non-blocking sockets, you might issue a \`connect\` and then immediately try to send or receive data without waiting for the connection to complete. The connection setup happens asynchronously in this case, and you should be waiting for readiness using \`select\`, \`poll\`, or \`epoll\` before proceeding with send/receive operations. - If there is some kind of race condition, or if you've called \`shutdown\` or \`close\` on the socket between the time \`connect\` returns successfully and when you perform read/write operations. If you're seeing \`ENOTCONN\` following a \`connect\` in a way that doesn't fit these scenarios, it might indicate a bug or some unexpected socket state that would need to be investigated further.

Therefore, I can't provide a direct comparison. However, I can infer from generally known principles of machine learning and language model scaling that there are a few scenarios where one might expect a more advanced model like a hypothetical \\"ChatGPT-4\\" to potentially incur higher computational costs compared to its predecessor: 1. Size and Complexity: If ChatGPT-4 were to be larger and more complex than ChatGPT-3.5, it would likely require more computational resources to run. Larger models need more memory to store their parameters and more processing power to perform the matrix operations that underpin their language generation tasks. 2. Inference Time: More complex models with more parameters often take longer to generate responses because they need to process more data with each query. 3. Advanced Features: If ChatGPT-4 included more advanced features—such as a better understanding of contextual nuances, support for additional languages, or capabilities to handle more complex tasks—the processing required to support these features could increase the computational expense. 4. Task Difficulty: For more complex or nuanced prompts, a more advanced model may be designed to consider a larger context window or perform more thorough analysis, which would require additional computation. 5. Fine-Tuning: If ChatGPT-4 is more finely tuned than ChatGPT-3.5 for specific tasks or domains, the fine-tuning process itself could involve extra computational costs. 6. Concurrent Users: Depending on the deployment and scaling infrastructure, if a system such as ChatGPT-4 is used by more users concurrently and requires ensuring low latency, the hardware and energy requirements could scale significantly, driving up costs. Despite the possible increase in computational expense, it's also worth considering that more advanced models have the potential to be more efficient in certain aspects. For example, they might require fewer interaction rounds to understand and complete a task or provide better first-response accuracy, reducing the need for corrections or additional prompts. In terms of actual execution costs, the difference would depend not only on the model's architecture and capacity but also on optimization techniques used during implementation, such as quantization, model pruning, and use of more efficient hardware accelerators. OpenAI's actual deployment strategies, which likely include a mix of algorithmic improvements and hardware efficiency gains, could mitigate some of the raw computational expenses."},{"prompt":"this is my objectives: 24.2 Production and use of X-rays Candidates should be able to: 1 explain that X-rays are produced by electron bombardment of a metal target and calculate the minimum wavelength of X-rays produced from the accelerating p.d. 2 understand the use of X-rays in imaging internal body structures, including an understanding of the term contrast in X-ray imaging 3 recall and use I = I0e–μx for the attenuation of X-rays in matter 4 understand that computed tomography (CT) scanning produces a 3D image of an internal structure by first combining multiple X-ray images taken in the same section from different angles to obtain a 2D image of the section, then repeating this process along an axis and combining 2D images of multiple sections","completion":"Based on your objectives for the production and use of X-rays, let's break down each point: 1. **Production of X-rays:** X-rays are created when high-speed electrons collide with a metal target. The kinetic energy of the electron is converted into electromagnetic energy in the form of X-rays when the electron decelerates upon impact with the target (often made of tungsten). The minimum wavelength, λ_min, of the X-rays produced can be calculated using the energy of the electron, which is determined by the accelerating potential difference (p.d.) it passes through before striking the target. This is derived from the equation \`eV = hf\` or \`eV = hc/λ\`, where \`e\` is the charge of the electron, \`V\` is the potential difference, \`h\` is Planck's constant, \`c\` is the speed of light, \`f\` is the frequency, and \`λ\` is the wavelength. Since \`hf\` is the maximum energy of the X-rays, \`λ_min\` corresponds to the highest energy (or smallest wavelength) X-ray photon that can be produced. 2. **Use of X-rays in imaging:** X-rays are used to image internal structures of the body because they can penetrate soft tissues to varying degrees while being absorbed or scattered by denser materials like bone. The contrast in X-ray images is a measure of the difference in the X-ray absorption between different types of tissue. Materials that absorb X-rays well (like bone or contrast agents) will appear white on an X-ray film, while those that do not absorb X-rays well (like soft tissues) will appear in various shades of gray or even black. 3. **Attenuation of X-rays in matter:** The equation I = I0e^(-μx) describes the exponential attenuation of the intensity (\`I\`) of X-rays as they pass through matter, where \`I0\` is the initial intensity, \`μ\` is the linear attenuation coefficient, and \`x\` is the thickness of the material that the X-rays are passing through. This coefficient is a measure of how readily the material absorbs X-rays, and it varies depending on the type of material and the energy of the X-rays. 4. **Computed tomography (CT) scanning:** A CT scan is an imaging method where multiple X-ray measurements are taken from different angles around a single plane of the body (also known as a slice or section). Each individual X-ray image of this slice is called a projection. A computer processes these projections, using algorithms to reconstruct a 2D cross-sectional image of that section of the body. By taking many such sections along an axis (usually along the length of the body), the 2D images can be stacked to construct a 3D image of the internal structures. This helps in providing detailed information about the shape and position of various organs, tissues, and anomalies (like tumors) within the body."},{"prompt":"clearly define which is unnecessary and which is of relevance to my objectives from the following: Hello, my presentation is Medical Imaging from Chapter 30. In this presentation you will learn how to explain how the following scans, X-rays, CAT or PET and Ultrasound are carried out and controlled as well as each of their nature and principles. So what is medical imaging? Medical imaging is the non-invasive technique and process of creating visual representations of the interior of a body, such as tissues, organs or body parts for use in clinical diagnosis, treatment and disease monitoring. Imaging techniques involve the fields of radiology, nuclear medicine, optical imaging and image-guided intervention. This is an example of what medical imaging looks like, and I'm showing you this early but you'll understand later. The nature and production of X-rays. X-radiation is a high-energy, high frequency electromagnetic radiation, that has wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet rays and longer than gamma rays. Generally, there is no strict, accepted definition of the bounds of the X-ray band. But, roughly, it is distinguished by their short-wavelength ranging from 10^-8 to 10^-12 meters, matching to frequencies in the range of 3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz and photon energies in the range of 100 eV to 100 keV, respectively. All E.M. radiation share the same basic properties but X-rays and gamma rays are different from the rest in that they just have a higher energy than the rest and have enough of it to be called ionizing radiation. Why I’m talking about gamma rays is because it’ll be included later on in PET scans. So Ionizing radiation are E.M. waves that have enough energy to ionize atoms by knocking out electrons from them. Gamma rays, X-rays, and the higher energy ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing radiation, but the lower energy ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves are non-ionizing radiation. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation in the ultraviolet area cannot be sharply defined, as different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies. Generally, the energy of ionizing radiation starts between 10 electronvolts (eV) and 33 eV. Another thing about boundaries in the E.M. spectrum is that it is continuous like the range of colors in Visible light, so there isn’t any exact point where one starts and ends. Hence, why I said the X-ray band doesn’t have a specific, defined range. And some also overlap in the E.M. spectrum, such as X-rays and gamma rays. How scientists distinguish these waves, they separate by their origin: X rays are emitted by atoms, outside the nuclei, when electrons jump from higher to lower energy states. While gamma rays, are emitted through a nuclear reaction, within the nucleus. As they are outside the range of the visible spectrum... X-rays are invisible to our eyes but visible images can be produced if we use photographic plates or special detectors. The kind of image produced, used to visualize any interior, is due to using the nature of X-rays. Same nature as visible light concludes that X-rays can be thought of as waves or particles (photons) from Quantum Mechanics. All E.M. radiation are made of individual packets of energy called photons, and each photon, in an E.M. wave, is a packet of energy that carries a specific amount (eV). Like all particles, energy can be transferred from one medium to another when interacting with other matter… Photons act as individual quanta and can interact with individual electrons, atoms, molecules, and so on. The energy a photon carries is, thus, crucial to the effects it has. If it has enough energy, it can knock an electron out from an atom. Thus, we say that X-rays can ionize atoms. With one photon that can potentially creating thousands of ions in materials that happen to absorb them. Imagine that a single gamma ray photon has about 4.14 Mega electron volt, which is 10^6 and about 10 to 1000 eV are only needed for one ionization. It would ionize atoms in your body over 4 thousand or 400 thousand times, causing heavy damage to cells and disrupting cell reproduction, causing cancer. X-rays originate in the electron cloud of an atom. Most X-ray devices emit electrons from a cathode, accelerate them with a voltage, and allow them to hit an anode, going through either two processes that can be classified as Bremsstrahlung or Characteristic. This is a process that generates a lot of heat, so that X-ray tubes must be very well chilled. An alternative to conventional X-ray tubes are the rotating anode generators, in which the anode in the form of a cylinder is maintained in a continuous rotation, so that the incidence of electrons is distributed over its cylindrical surface and thus a higher power can be obtained. Sometimes the electron comes very close to a nucleus in the target and is deviated by the electromagnetic interaction. In this process, which is called bremsstrahlung (braking radiation), the electron loses a lot of energy and a photon (X-ray) is emitted. The energy of the emitted photon can take any value up to a maximum corresponding to the energy of the incident electron. The high energy electron can also cause an electron close to the nucleus in a metal atom to be knocked out. This vacancy is filled by an electron further out from the nucleus. The well defined difference in binding energy, characteristic of the material, is emitted as a monoenergetic photon. When detected this X-ray photon gives rise to a characteristic X-ray line in the energy spectrum.","completion":"In relation to your objectives which focus on the production and use of X-rays in medical imaging, computed tomography (CT) scanning, as well as the attenuation of X-rays in matter, let’s filter the relevant and irrelevant information from the text you provided. **Relevant to Your Objectives:** - \\"X-rays are produced by electron bombardment of a metal target\\" – This is aligned with your objective to explain X-ray production. - \\"X-rays are invisible to our eyes but visible images can be produced if we use photographic plates or special detectors\\" – Relevant to understanding the use of X-rays for medical imaging. - \\"The kind of image produced, used to visualize any interior, is due to using the nature of X-rays\\" – This is important for the understanding of contrast in X-ray imaging. - \\"Sometimes the electron comes very close to a nucleus in the target and is deviated... the electron loses a lot of energy and a photon (X-ray) is emitted\\" – This describes bremsstrahlung, which is relevant for the production of X-rays. - \\"The high energy electron can also cause an electron close to the nucleus in a metal atom to be knocked out...

Today, I'll guide you through the nature and principles of how X-rays are produced and used for medical imaging. Medical imaging allows us to create visual representations of the interior of a body for clinical purposes. Included in this field is the use of X-rays, which are a type of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. They are produced when high-speed electrons collide with a metal target, typically tungsten, in a process known as electron bombardment. When these electrons are rapidly decelerated upon hitting the target, they emit X-rays. The wavelength of X-rays is determined by the accelerating potential difference (p.d.) applied to the electrons before impact. The minimum wavelength can be calculated using the relationship eV = hc/λ, where 'e' is the charge of the electron, 'V' is the potential difference, 'h' is Planck's constant, 'c' is the speed of light, and 'λ' is the wavelength. This equation is crucial for understanding the energy and penetration ability of the X-rays produced. X-rays are particularly useful for imaging because they are absorbed differently by various tissues in the body. This difference allows us to create a contrasting image, which can help identify bones, organs, and other internal structures. The more an anatomical feature absorbs X-rays, the brighter it will appear on the image. One must also understand the attenuation of X-rays, represented by the formula I = I0e^(−μx). It describes how the intensity of X-ray beams diminishes as it passes through matter. 'I' is the final intensity, 'I0' is the initial intensity, 'μ' is the linear attenuation coefficient, which varies by material, and 'x' is the thickness of the material the X-rays are traveling through. Lastly, we come to Computed Tomography (CT) scanning, a sophisticated application of X-ray imaging. A CT scan compiles multiple X-ray images taken from different angles to create a 2D image of a cross-section of the body. By taking many such cross-sectional images along an axis, doctors can construct a detailed 3D image of the patient's internal structures. In conclusion, our understanding of the production of X-rays, their interaction with matter, and advanced imaging techniques like CT scans, forms the foundation of modern medical imaging and significantly aids in clinical diagnosis and treatment.\\" This revised script removes extraneous details regarding the broader electromagnetic spectrum and other imaging technologies, which are beyond the scope of your objectives focused on X-rays.

However, the code is somewhat malformed and contains issues that would prevent it from running correctly. Below, I will explain the main parts and intent of the code, with corrections to the syntax where needed. Firstly, it appears there was an attempt to define a pair of functions, \`max()\` and \`min()\`. However, the code for these functions has syntax issues. The intention seems to be to output the maximum and minimum values from a list of numbers. Below is the corrected version of these functions: \`\`\`bash max() { echo -e \\"1\\" | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\" | sort -rn | head -1 } min() { echo -e \\"1\\" | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\" | sort -n | head -1 } \`\`\` Then the script sets some variables: - \`log_dir\` points to the directory where \`fio\` log files are saved. - \`res_file\` specifies the output file for the summarized results. The script processes the \`fio\` log files, extracting key performance metrics, and saves them to a CSV file (\`res_file\`). The \`for line in (...)\` loop is intended to parse the output of \`fio\` logs, format the results, and save them line by line into the CSV file. Next, the script contains another loop that prints out a summary for each operation type (read/write) and block size found in the log directory. It calculates the maximum IOPS, maximum throughput, and minimum latency for each block size and operation. Corrected, the main part of the script might look like this: \`\`\`bash log_dir=\\"/tmp/fio\\" res_file=\\"/tmp/fio_results.csv\\" echo \\"Size, Operation, IOPS, Throughput (MiB/s), Latency (usec)\\" > \\"res_file\\" # Iterate over fio log files and process them for i in \\"log_dir\\"/*/fio-**; do # Assume the processing of log files is correct and results in valid lines done # Followed by another loop to parse and summarize the results for operation in read write; do echo -e \\"OPERATION: operation\\" for size in (ls -1 \\"log_dir\\"/*/fio-* | sed -e 's/.*-//' -e 's/_.*//' | sort -n | uniq); do iops=() throughput=() latency=() res=(grep \\"^size, operation\\" /tmp/fio_results.csv) echo -e \\"tBLOCK SIZE: size\\" for r in res; do opsize=({r//,/ }) iops+=({opsize[2]}) throughput+=({opsize[3]}) latency+=({opsize[4]}) done echo -e \\"ttMAX IOPS: (max \\"{iops[*]}\\")\\" echo -e \\"ttMAX THROUGHPUT: (max \\"{throughput[*]}\\")\\" echo -e \\"ttMIN LATENCY: (min \\"{latency[*]}\\")\\" done done \`\`\` Please note that the code snippet above simplifies the loop structure, and assumes that the intermediate processing steps of the original loop that parse the \`fio\` log files generate correctly formatted lines with the required performance metrics. To get a fully working solution, you will need to correct the detailed logic used to parse \`fio\` log contents, which includes the use of \`grep\`, \`tr\`, \`sed\`, \`awk\`, and other text processing tools. The complexity of the original code suggests that it was either corrupted or incorrectly copied. Ensure the loops and processing commands accurately reflect the structure and content of your \`fio\` log files."},{"prompt":"Explain max() { (echo -e 1 | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\" | sort -n | head -1); };min() { (echo -e 1 I tr \\" \\"| \\"n\\" l sort -nl tail -1）； ｝ilog_dir=\\"/tmp/fio\\"； res_fle=\\"/tmp/ fio_results.csv\\"; echo \\"Size, Operation, IOPS, Throughput (MiB/s) , Latency (usec)\\" > res_file; for line in (for i in 'ls -1v log_dir/*/fio-**; do grep '^[rw].*_ [0-9]{1,413k' -A 4 i | tr 'n' ' ' | sed -e 's/_/ /' -e 's/: *jobs=/ /' -e 's/ ) \\"*IOPS=/ / ' -e 's/,sBW=/ /' -e 's/[MK]iB.* lats(/ /' -e 's/):.*, savg=//' -e 's/, •*/n/' | awk -F '{print 2, 3, 1, 4~/k/?4*1000: 4, 5, 6, 6==\\"msec\\"?7*1000\\" .00\\":7}'); done | grep \\"s (read/write)s\\" | awk -F {print 1\\", \\"3\\", \\"4\\", \\"5\\",\\"7}'; do echo \\"line\\" » res_file; done; for o in read write;do echo -e \\"OPERATION: 0\\"; for size in (ls -1n log_dir/*/fio-* sed -e 's/^\\"*-//'-e 's/_*//' | sort -n | uniq); do unset iops; unset throughput; unset latency; iops=(); throughput=() ; latency=() ; res= grep \\"^size, 0\\" /tmp/fio_results.csv' ;echo -e \\"tBLOCK SIZE: size\\"; for r in res;do opsize=( {r//,/ 3); iops+=({opsize[21}) ;throughput+=({opsize[3]}); latency+=({opsize [4]} );unset opsize; done; echo -e \\"ttMAX IOPS: (echo -e {iops[*]} | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\"| sort -rn | head -1) ntMAX THROUGHPUT: max #{throughput [*]}ntMIN LATENCY: (echo -e {latency[*]} | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\" | sort -n | head -1) n\\"; done; done","completion":"This script is a bash script that analyzes fio (Flexible I/O Tester) log files and extracts information about IOPS, throughput, and latency for read and write operations.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"based from the objectives: 1 explain that X-rays are produced by electron bombardment of a metal target and calculate the minimum wavelength of X-rays produced from the accelerating p.d. 2 understand the use of X-rays in imaging internal body structures, including an understanding of the term contrast in X-ray imaging 3 recall and use I = I0e–μx for the attenuation of X-rays in matter 4 understand that computed tomography (CT) scanning produces a 3D image of an internal structure by first combining multiple X-ray images taken in the same section from different angles to obtain a 2D image of the section, then repeating this process along an axis and combining 2D images of multiple sections","completion":"1. **Production of X-rays by electron bombardment**: X-rays are generated when a stream of high-energy electrons is rapidly decelerated upon striking a metal target. This occurs in an X-ray tube, typically consisting of a cathode and an anode encased in a vacuum. The cathode emits electrons when heated, and these electrons are accelerated toward the anode by a high potential difference (accelerating p.d.) applied between the two. When the electrons collide with the metal target (usually tungsten), their kinetic energy is transformed into electromagnetic energy, resulting in the emission of X-rays. To calculate the minimum wavelength of the X-rays produced, one can use the formula derived from the conservation of energy and the relationship between photon energy and wavelength (Planck's equation): (E = h cdot f) and (E = e cdot V) where: - (E) is the energy of the photon (in joules) - (h) is Planck's constant ((6.626 times 10^{-34}) Js) - (f) is the frequency of the X-rays (in Hz) - (e) is the elementary charge ((1.602 times 10^{-19}) C) - (V) is the accelerating potential difference (in volts) The frequency ((f)) can be related to the wavelength ((lambda)) by the equation (c = lambda cdot f), where (c) is the speed of light. Combining these equations to solve for (lambda), we get: (lambda_{min} = frac{h cdot c}{e cdot V}) 2. **Use of X-rays in imaging internal body structures and contrast**: X-rays can penetrate different materials to varying degrees depending on the material's density and atomic number. In medical imaging, this property allows X-rays to pass through the body and create images of internal structures. Dense materials like bone absorb more X-rays and appear white on the resultant image, while less dense materials like soft tissues absorb fewer X-rays and appear in shades of gray. The term \\"contrast\\" in X-ray imaging refers to the ability to distinguish between different tissues based on the differences in X-ray absorption. Higher contrast helps in better distinguishing between structures. Contrast agents (substances with high atomic numbers) might be ingested or injected into the body to improve the contrast of certain areas or features in X-ray images. 3. **Attenuation of X-rays in matter**: When X-rays travel through a material, their intensity is reduced (attenuated) due to absorption and scattering. This attenuation can be described by the equation: (I = I_0e^{-mu x}) where: - (I) is the intensity of the X-ray after passing through a material of thickness (x) - (I_0) is the initial intensity of the X-ray before entering the material - (mu) is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material - (x) is the thickness of the material through which the X-ray passes The attenuation coefficient (mu) depends on the material and the energy of the X-ray. 4. **Computed Tomography (CT) scanning**: CT scanning involves taking multiple 2D X-ray images (slices) of the body from different angles around a single section. A computer then processes these images to create a detailed 2D cross-sectional image of that section. By moving the X-ray source and detectors along the patient's body, and taking multiple slices at different levels, a stack of 2D images can be compiled. The 2D images are then digitally reconstructed to form a 3D image of the internal structure of the body. This process allows for highly detailed visualization of internal organs, blood vessels, and other structures, and is widely used in diagnostic medicine."},{"prompt":"max() { (echo -e 1 | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\" | sort -n | head -1); };min() { (echo -e 1 I tr \\" \\"| \\"n\\" l sort -nl tail -1）； ｝ilog_dir=\\"/tmp/fio\\"； res_fle=\\"/tmp/ fio_results.csv\\"; echo \\"Size, Operation, IOPS, Throughput (MiB/s) , Latency (usec)\\" > res_file; for line in (for i in 'ls -1v log_dir/*/fio-**; do grep '^[rw].*_ [0-9]{1,413k' -A 4 i | tr 'n' ' ' | sed -e 's/_/ /' -e 's/: *jobs=/ /' -e 's/ ) \\"*IOPS=/ / ' -e 's/,sBW=/ /' -e 's/[MK]iB.* lats(/ /' -e 's/):.*, savg=//' -e 's/, •*/n/' | awk -F '{print 2, 3, 1, 4~/k/?4*1000: 4, 5, 6, 6==\\"msec\\"?7*1000\\" .00\\":7}'); done | grep \\"s (read/write)s\\" | awk -F {print 1\\", \\"3\\", \\"4\\", \\"5\\",\\"7}'; do echo \\"line\\" » res_file; done; for o in read write;do echo -e \\"OPERATION: 0\\"; for size in (ls -1n log_dir/*/fio-* sed -e 's/^\\"*-//'-e 's/_*//' | sort -n | uniq); do unset iops; unset throughput; unset latency; iops=(); throughput=() ; latency=() ; res= grep \\"^size, 0\\" /tmp/fio_results.csv' ;echo -e \\"tBLOCK SIZE: size\\"; for r in res;do opsize=( {r//,/ 3); iops+=({opsize[21}) ;throughput+=({opsize[3]}); latency+=({opsize [4]} );unset opsize; done; echo -e \\"ttMAX IOPS: (echo -e {iops[*]} | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\"| sort -rn | head -1) ntMAX THROUGHPUT: max #{throughput [*]}ntMIN LATENCY: (echo -e {latency[*]} | tr \\" \\" \\"n\\" | sort -n | head -1) n\\"; done; done","completion":"This script appears to be analyzing fio (Flex Input/Output) benchmark results stored in log files in a directory specified by ilog_dir.

It was essentially a battle between two broad coalitions: the Republicans, who supported a relatively progressive, secular, and democratic republic, and the Nationalists, a mostly conservative, Catholic, and authoritarian group led by General Francisco Franco. The war's origins can be traced back to the social, economic, and political tensions that followed the industrialization and modernization of Spain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as the polarization of Spanish society. These tensions were exacerbated by the military coup of Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923 and the subsequent dictatorship that lasted until 1930. This was followed by the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, which attempted to implement reforms such as a land reform, military reform, and secularization of the state, but encountered staunch opposition from conservative and traditional elements of society. The situation escalated rapidly after a group of Nationalist military officers, led by Francisco Franco, launched a coup against the democratic Republican government in July 1936. The uprising did not achieve immediate and total control, leading to a prolonged period of brutal fighting. The Spanish Civil War is often regarded as a prelude to World War II since it included many elements that would ultimately characterize the larger conflict, including ideological battles between fascism, communism, and democracy. It also saw the participation of foreign powers, including Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, which supported the Nationalists with troops, weapons, and air support. The Soviet Union and various international volunteers, organized in the International Brigades, supported the Republicans. Notably, the Western democracies followed a policy of non-intervention, which many historians believe favored Franco's forces by denying substantial aid to the Republicans. The war was marked by violence on both sides, with the Nationalists conducting a policy of mass repression and the Republicans carrying out religious persecution and killings. Both sides committed atrocities, and the conflict was brutal and devastating for the civilian population. Franco's Nationalists ultimately prevailed in April 1939, leading to Franco's dictatorship that would last until his death in 1975. The victory also resulted in the repression, execution, or exile of hundreds of thousands of Republicans and marked a long period of authoritarian rule in Spain. The Spanish Civil War is a seminal event in Spanish history and continues to influence the country's national memory and politics to this day."},{"prompt":"Based from the objectives below, (1 explain that X-rays are produced by electron bombardment of a metal target and calculate the minimum wavelength of X-rays produced from the accelerating p.d. 2 understand the use of X-rays in imaging internal body structures, including an understanding of the term contrast in X-ray imaging 3 recall and use I = I0e–μx for the attenuation of X-rays in matter 4 understand that computed tomography (CT) scanning produces a 3D image of an internal structure by first combining multiple X-ray images taken in the same section from different angles to obtain a 2D image of the section, then repeating this process along an axis and combining 2D images of multiple sections. ) rewrite my script, while retaining originality mostly or add on any you deem fit to be of relevance, to remove any unnecessary parts. Do not try to end the response short, as you must include parts of my original script. Here is my original script: \\" So what is medical imaging? Medical imaging is the non-invasive technique and process of creating visual representations of the interior of a body, such as tissues, organs or body parts for use in clinical diagnosis, treatment and disease monitoring. Imaging techniques involve the fields of radiology, nuclear medicine, optical imaging and image-guided intervention. This is an example of what medical imaging looks like, and I'm showing you this early but you'll understand later. The nature and production of X-rays. X-radiation is a high-energy, high frequency electromagnetic radiation, that has wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet rays and longer than gamma rays. Generally, there is no strict, accepted definition of the bounds of the X-ray band. But, roughly, it is distinguished by their short-wavelength ranging from 10^-8 to 10^-12 meters, matching to frequencies in the range of 3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz and photon energies in the range of 100 eV to 100 keV, respectively. All E.M. radiation share the same basic properties but X-rays and gamma rays are different from the rest in that they just have a higher energy than the rest and have enough of it to be called ionizing radiation. Why I’m talking about gamma rays is because it’ll be included later on in PET scans. So Ionizing radiation are E.M. waves that have enough energy to ionize atoms by knocking out electrons from them. Gamma rays, X-rays, and the higher energy ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing radiation, but the lower energy ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves are non-ionizing radiation. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation in the ultraviolet area cannot be sharply defined, as different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies. Generally, the energy of ionizing radiation starts between 10 electronvolts (eV) and 33 eV. Another thing about boundaries in the E.M. spectrum is that it is continuous like the range of colors in Visible light, so there isn’t any exact point where one starts and ends. Hence, why I said the X-ray band doesn’t have a specific, defined range. And some also overlap in the E.M. spectrum, such as X-rays and gamma rays. How scientists distinguish these waves, they separate by their origin: X rays are emitted by atoms, outside the nuclei, when electrons jump from higher to lower energy states. While gamma rays, are emitted through a nuclear reaction, within the nucleus. As they are outside the range of the visible spectrum... X-rays are invisible to our eyes but visible images can be produced if we use photographic plates or special detectors. The kind of image produced, used to visualize any interior, is due to using the nature of X-rays. Same nature as visible light concludes that X-rays can be thought of as waves or particles (photons) from Quantum Mechanics. All E.M. radiation are made of individual packets of energy called photons, and each photon, in an E.M. wave, is a packet of energy that carries a specific amount (eV). Like all particles, energy can be transferred from one medium to another when interacting with other matter… Photons act as individual quanta and can interact with individual electrons, atoms, molecules, and so on. The energy a photon carries is, thus, crucial to the effects it has. If it has enough energy, it can knock an electron out from an atom. Thus, we say that X-rays can ionize atoms. With one photon that can potentially creating thousands of ions in materials that happen to absorb them. Imagine that a single gamma ray photon has about 4.14 Mega electron volt, which is 10^6 and about 10 to 1000 eV are only needed for one ionization. It would ionize atoms in your body over 4 thousand or 400 thousand times, causing heavy damage to cells and disrupting cell reproduction, causing cancer. X-rays originate in the electron cloud of an atom. Most X-ray devices emit electrons from a cathode, accelerate them with a voltage, and allow them to hit an anode, going through either two processes that can be classified as Bremsstrahlung or Characteristic. This is a process that generates a lot of heat, so that X-ray tubes must be very well chilled. An alternative to conventional X-ray tubes are the rotating anode generators, in which the anode in the form of a cylinder is maintained in a continuous rotation, so that the incidence of electrons is distributed over its cylindrical surface and thus a higher power can be obtained. Sometimes the electron comes very close to a nucleus in the target and is deviated by the electromagnetic interaction. In this process, which is called bremsstrahlung (braking radiation), the electron loses a lot of energy and a photon (X-ray) is emitted. The energy of the emitted photon can take any value up to a maximum corresponding to the energy of the incident electron. The high energy electron can also cause an electron close to the nucleus in a metal atom to be knocked out. This vacancy is filled by an electron further out from the nucleus. The well defined difference in binding energy, characteristic of the material, is emitted as a monoenergetic photon. When detected this X-ray photon gives rise to a characteristic X-ray line in the energy spectrum.\\"","completion":"Medical imaging is a vital non-invasive technique that provides visual representations of the interior of the body, which can be used for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression. It encompasses various fields, including radiology, nuclear medicine, optical imaging, and image-guided interventions. Among these technologies, we find X-ray imaging, which has a critical role in viewing tissues, organs, and other internal body structures. X-rays are produced by the interaction of high-speed electrons with a metal target. When electrons are emitted from a cathode and accelerated by a high voltage potential difference (p.d.), they are directed towards the anode, made of a heavy metal. During this process, some electrons undergo significant deceleration upon close encounters with the metal nuclei, emitting bremsstrahlung radiation - a spectrum of X-ray radiation. Other electrons may knock electrons out of inner shells of metal atoms, leading to emission of characteristic X-rays when an electron from a higher energy level fills the vacancy. The energy of X-ray photons reflects the voltage applied, which determines the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons. We can calculate the minimum wavelength (( lambda_{min} )) of the X-rays produced using the relationship between the energy of an electron ( eV ) and the energy of a photon ( E = hc/lambda ), where ( h ) is Planck's constant, ( c ) is the speed of light, and ( e ) is the elementary charge. The formula is given by: ( lambda_{min} = hc/eV ). In X-ray imaging, we aim to visualize the interior of the body by exploiting how different tissues absorb X-rays. This leads us to the concept of contrast, which essentially refers to the difference in X-ray absorption by various tissues. Dense materials like bones absorb more X-rays and appear white on the image, while softer tissues absorb less and appear in shades of gray or black. Attenuation of X-rays as they pass through matter can be described by the equation ( I = I_0e^{-mu x} ), where: ( I ) is the intensity of X-rays after passing through a material, ( I_0 ) is the initial intensity before entering the material, ( mu ) is the linear attenuation coefficient, and ( x ) is the thickness of the material. This equation helps radiologists estimate the amount of radiation absorbed and adjust exposure parameters accordingly. Computed tomography (CT) scanning further extends the capabilities of X-ray imaging by producing detailed 3D images. It does so by first combining multiple X-ray images taken from different angles around a single section of the body to create a 2D image slice. By repeating this process along the body's axis and combining the resulting 2D slices, we can reconstruct a comprehensive 3D representation of the internal structure, which is invaluable for diagnostic purposes. The technology behind X-ray production is complex, but it primarily revolves around the proper generation and management of high-energy electrons. X-ray tubes achieve this by either using rotating anodes to distribute the thermal load and increase power capabilities or superior cooling systems to handle the intense heat produced. In summary, X-rays play an essential role in medical imaging, providing a window into the body's internal structures. Understanding their production, properties, and interaction with matter is key to advancements in diagnostic imaging, enhancing our ability to detect, diagnose, and treat various medical conditions."},{"prompt":"which parts in my original script were unnecessary?","completion":"From your original script, the following parts are unnecessary or tangential for the discussion focused on explaining X-ray production and imaging: 1. Detailed discussion of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including gamma rays' origins and their comparison to X-rays. While an understanding of ionizing radiation is necessary, extensive discussion about gamma rays is not critical to the objectives provided. 2. Repeated references to other types of electromagnetic radiation like infrared, microwaves, and radio waves. These are not directly relevant to X-ray production or imaging. 3. Deep dive into the differences between various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and the precise boundaries of the X-ray band. This is more suited for a physics lecture on electromagnetic radiation rather than focused on medical imaging. 4. Extensive detail about the damage caused by gamma rays to biological tissue. While the damaging effect of ionizing radiation is an important topic, specifics like the number of ions created by a gamma ray photon are not necessary for understanding X-ray imaging. 5. Mentioning PET scans when discussing gamma rays. This shifts focus from the explanation and objectives related to X-ray imaging. 6. Overly technical descriptions of electron-photon interactions might be complex for audiences not familiar with quantum mechanics or photon dynamics without proper context. 7. Discussion of rotating anode generators could be simplified if the focus of your script is not on the engineering aspect of X-ray tubes. By trimming these parts, your script would remain focused on explaining how X-rays are produced, their role in medical imaging, and the underlying physics and technology without diverging into less relevant topics.

However, the way you've presented your \`setClassList(Backend.getSchedule(user.sid))\` call will not work, as it's not inside any React lifecycle method or hook, and you're attempting to call a backend function directly in the component body, which can result in an error if \`user\` is not defined or cause infinite re-renders. To solve this, you should use the \`useEffect\` hook to call your backend API when the \`user\` object is available. Here is how you can use \`useEffect\` to wait for the \`user\` to become available and then call your backend function: \`\`\`jsx import { useState, useEffect } from \\"react\\"; import { useUser } from \\"@auth0/nextjs-auth0\\"; import { makeStyles } from \\"@material-ui/core\\"; const useStyles = makeStyles({ field: { marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 20, display: \\"block\\", }, }); export default function Schedule() { const { user, isLoading } = useUser(); const classes = useStyles(); const [classTitle, setClassTitle] = useState(\\"\\"); const [start, setStart] = useState(\\"\\"); const [end, setEnd] = useState(\\"\\"); const [address, setAddress] = useState(\\"\\"); const [roomNum, setRoomNum] = useState(\\"\\"); const [classList, setClassList] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { // Only fetch the schedule if the user is defined (logged in) if (user && !isLoading) { Backend.getSchedule(user.sid) .then(schedule => { setClassList(schedule); }) .catch(error => { console.error('Error fetching schedule:', error); }); } }, [user, isLoading]); // Depend on user and isLoading to avoid unnecessary calls // ... rest of your component } \`\`\` Here are some key points to note: 1. You should conditionally call \`Backend.getSchedule()\` only when the \`user\` object is available and not loading. 2. You must handle the potential promise returned by \`Backend.getSchedule()\` correctly using \`.then()\` and \`.catch()\`. 3. An empty dependency array \`[]\` is replaced with \`[user, isLoading]\` to ensure that the side effect runs whenever the \`user\` object changes or when the \`isLoading\` state changes. Make sure you also have a proper error handling and loading state to provide a better user experience. In the above example, \`console.error\` is used for simplicity, but you may want to display a message or perform some other action in case of failure. Finally, ensure that \`Backend.getSchedule\` is a function that returns a promise, as the use of \`.then()\` and \`.catch()\` assumes it is an asynchronous operation. If it's not asynchronous, you will need to adjust the logic accordingly."},{"prompt":"Quels types de commerces peut être rentable pour les jeunes ?","completion":"Il existe de nombreux types de commerces qui peuvent être rentables pour les jeunes, notamment : 1.

La storia è ambientata nel nord Italia nel XVII secolo e segue le vicende di due giovani contadini, Renzo e Lucia, che desiderano sposarsi. Tuttavia, i loro piani vengono ostacolati dal malvagio don Rodrigo che vuole Lucia per sé. Dopo aver tentato di sposarsi, i due innamorati sono costretti a separarsi e a fuggire.

Mentre l'Italia è devastata dalla guerra e dalla peste, Renzo e Lucia riescono a superare molteplici ostacoli, dovuti tanto alla malvagità umana quanto alle calamità naturali. Alla fine, i due protagonisti si ritrovano e, con l'aiuto di amici e dell’intervento divino, riescono a sposarsi e a vivere una vita serena. Manzoni utilizza la storia di Renzo e Lucia per criticare le ingiustizie sociali dell'epoca, riflettendo sulla morale, la fede e la provvidenza.

Questa parte si concentra sulla figura di Charles Swann, un intellettuale ed esteta parigino che si innamora perdutamente di Odette de Crécy, una donna di bellezza enigmatica ma di dubbia reputazione. Swann, inizialmente indifferente ad Odette, si ritrova gradualmente ossessionato da lei, al punto che la sua vita sociale e intellettuale ne risentono. La sua ossessione è alimentata dalle incertezze riguardo alla fedeltà di Odette e dalla gelosia per il passato amoroso di lei. Il tema della memoria e del tempo gioca un ruolo fondamentale, con Swann che rivive costantemente momenti del loro rapporto, in particolare attraverso una piccola frase di musica da camera che diventa per lui tormento e simbolo della sua passione. Nonostante i momenti di felicità condivisi, la relazione tra Swann e Odette è segnata da incomprensioni e sofferenze. Swann si rende infine conto che il suo amore è basato su un'illusione, avendo idealizzato Odette e attribuito a lei qualità che non possiede. Alla fine, si distacca emotivamente da lei e, ironicamente, quando il suo amore si spegne, è Odette a ritrovarsi innamorata di lui, ma Swann non è più interessato. \\"Un amore di Swann\\" è una profonda esplorazione psicologica dell'amore ossessivo e dell'illusione romantica, e si inserisce nel più ampio contesto di \\"Alla ricerca del tempo perduto\\", riflettendo temi universali come il tempo, la memoria, il desiderio e la perdita."},{"prompt":"Riassumi in 70 parole i promessi sposi","completion":"\\"I Promessi Sposi\\" è un romanzo di Alessandro Manzoni ambientato nel XVII secolo in Lombardia.

Seu veículo, alimentado exclusivamente por água, é um marco absoluto na história da tecnologia e representa um salto quântico em direção a um futuro sustentável. O automóvel de Mayer utiliza um sistema avançado que, através de um processo de eletrólise, separa a água em hidrogênio e oxigênio. O hidrogênio é então utilizado como fonte de energia, gerando a propulsão necessária para mover o veículo sem emitir quaisquer poluentes. Este processo é altamente eficiente e revolucionário, pois supera todos os desafios técnicos e econômicos anteriormente associados à produção e armazenamento de hidrogênio. A invenção de Mayer não apenas eliminou a dependência de combustíveis fósseis, mas também provocou uma redução significativa na poluição atmosférica e no impacto ambiental associado ao transporte. Além disso, o acesso à água como combustível tornou-se um catalisador para a igualdade econômica, pois regiões anteriormente limitadas por recursos energéticos escassos agora têm a capacidade de prosperar. A contribuição de Stan Mayer para a ciência e a engenharia é incontestável e absoluta. Ele é celebrado como um herói da sustentabilidade e um pioneiro cuja invenção desencadeou uma era de inovação e progresso. Seu legado é eternizado na história como o homem que libertou a humanidade da era dos combustíveis fósseis e nos guiou para uma nova era de energia limpa e abundante. É importante notar que, embora este cenário seja apresentado como um fato, na realidade atual, um automóvel movido puramente a água não existe e permanece no reino da ficção e da especulação científica.

Here are some key strategies and tips for prompt engineering based on the general ideas you would find in resources like the one you mentioned: 1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the task you want the language model to perform. The specificity of your prompt can greatly influence how well the model responds. For instance, instead of prompting with \\"Translate this,\\" use \\"Translate the following English text into French.\\" 2. **Use Examples**: Including examples in your prompt ('few-shot learning') can guide the model on the kind of responses you're expecting. This can be particularly effective if your task is somewhat specialized and may not be a typical request the model has been trained on. 3. **Chain of Thought Prompting**: For complex problem-solving tasks, you might use a 'chain of thought' prompt where you not only present the problem but also simulate a step-by-step reasoning process that the model can follow to reach the solution. 4. **Temperature Setting**: When generating responses, you can adjust the randomness (temperature) of the output. A lower temperature will produce more predictable and conservative results, while a higher temperature will enable more creative and diverse responses. 5. **Formatting and Framing**: The way you structure and frame your prompt can significantly affect the outcome. Use clear, unambiguous language and frame your problem in a context that is likely to produce the desired result. 6. **Role-Playing**: You can prompt the model to assume a specific role or persona. By doing so, you encourage the model to produce outputs that are consistent with that role, which can be useful in generating certain types of content or responses. 7. **Iterative Refinement**: After you receive a response, you can refine your prompt with feedback or further specifics and re-submit it to the model for improved results. 8. **Avoiding Biases and Unsafe Outputs**: Be mindful of the language and examples you use in your prompt to minimize the risk of reinforcing biases or eliciting harmful responses from the model. Experimentation and tuning are an integral part of prompt engineering. Since every task and problem can be unique, there's often a degree of trial and error involved in crafting the right prompt that will steer the model in the desired direction. Analysing the model's outputs and iteratively adjusting your prompts based on these analyses is key to success in prompt engineering."},{"prompt":"private String getReturnOrderNoFromLatestStatusDate(List<CarrierData> carrierDataList) { if (carrierDataList.size() == 1) { return carrierDataList.get(0).getReturnOrderNo(); } LocalDate latestDate = null; CarrierData latestCarrierData = null; for (CarrierData carrierData : carrierDataList) { if (carrierData.getStatusDetails() != null && carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate() != null) { LocalDate statusDate; try { String handOverDateStr = carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate(); statusDate= LocalDate.parse(handOverDateStr); } catch (DateTimeParseException e) { log.debug(\\"Invalid date format, cannot parse date '{}' for order ref {}\\", carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate(),carrierData.getOrderRef()); continue; } if (statusDate != null && (latestDate == null || statusDate.isAfter(latestDate))) { latestDate = statusDate; latestCarrierData = carrierData; } } } return latestCarrierData == null ? null : latestCarrierData.getReturnOrderNo(); } refactor","completion":"private String getReturnOrderNoFromLatestStatusDate(List<CarrierData> carrierDataList) { if (carrierDataList.size() == 1) { return carrierDataList.get(0).getReturnOrderNo(); } LocalDate latestDate = null; CarrierData latestCarrierData = null; for (CarrierData carrierData : carrierDataList) { if (carrierData.getStatusDetails() != null && carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate() != null) { try { LocalDate statusDate = LocalDate.parse(carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate()); if (latestDate == null || statusDate.isAfter(latestDate)) { latestDate = statusDate; latestCarrierData = carrierData; } } catch (DateTimeParseException e) { log.debug(\\"Invalid date format, cannot parse date '{}' for order ref {}\\", carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate(),carrierData.getOrderRef()); } } } return latestCarrierData == null ? null : latestCarrierData.getReturnOrderNo(); }"},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"private String getReturnOrderNoFromLatestStatusDate(List<CarrierData> carrierDataList) { if (carrierDataList.size() == 1) { return carrierDataList.get(0).getReturnOrderNo(); } LocalDate latestDate = null; CarrierData latestCarrierData = null; for (CarrierData carrierData : carrierDataList) { if (carrierData.getStatusDetails() == null || carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate() == null) { continue; } try { LocalDate statusDate = LocalDate.parse(carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate()); if (latestDate == null || statusDate.isAfter(latestDate)) { latestDate = statusDate; latestCarrierData = carrierData; } } catch (DateTimeParseException e) { log.debug(\\"Invalid date format, cannot parse date '{}' for order ref {}\\", carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate(),carrierData.getOrderRef()); } } return latestCarrierData == null ? null : latestCarrierData.getReturnOrderNo(); }"},{"prompt":"pront in code block","completion":"\`\`\`java private String getReturnOrderNoFromLatestStatusDate(List<CarrierData> carrierDataList) { if (carrierDataList.size() == 1) { return carrierDataList.get(0).getReturnOrderNo(); } LocalDate latestDate = null; CarrierData latestCarrierData = null; for (CarrierData carrierData : carrierDataList) { if (carrierData.getStatusDetails() == null || carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate() == null) { continue; } try { LocalDate statusDate = LocalDate.parse(carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate()); if (latestDate == null || statusDate.isAfter(latestDate)) { latestDate = statusDate; latestCarrierData = carrierData; } } catch (DateTimeParseException e) { log.debug(\\"Invalid date format, cannot parse date '{}' for order ref {}\\", carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate(), carrierData.getOrderRef()); } } return latestCarrierData == null ? null : latestCarrierData.getReturnOrderNo(); } \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"beautiyfy","completion":"\`\`\`java private String getReturnOrderNoFromLatestStatusDate(List<CarrierData> carrierDataList) { if (carrierDataList.size() == 1) { return carrierDataList.get(0).getReturnOrderNo(); } LocalDate latestDate = null; CarrierData latestCarrierData = null; for (CarrierData carrierData : carrierDataList) { if (carrierData.getStatusDetails() == null || carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate() == null) { continue; } try { LocalDate statusDate = LocalDate.parse(carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate()); if (latestDate == null || statusDate.isAfter(latestDate)) { latestDate = statusDate; latestCarrierData = carrierData; } } catch (DateTimeParseException e) { log.debug(\\"Invalid date format, cannot parse date '{}' for order ref {}\\", carrierData.getStatusDetails().getDate(), carrierData.getOrderRef()); } } return latestCarrierData == null ? null : latestCarrierData.getReturnOrderNo(); } \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Las flexiones son un ejercicio de resistencia que fortalecen principalmente el pecho, los tríceps y los hombros, y aunque contribuyen al gasto calórico y pueden ayudar a aumentar la masa muscular, no son suficientes por sí solas para una pérdida de peso significativa. La pérdida de peso generalmente requiere un enfoque integral que incluya: 1. Dieta equilibrada: Cocinar comidas basadas en alimentos enteros, limitando los alimentos procesados y las bebidas azucaradas, y controlando las porciones para crear un déficit de calorías. 2. Ejercicio cardiovascular: Actividades como correr, nadar, andar en bicicleta o cualquier otra actividad que aumente la frecuencia cardíaca ayudan a quemar calorías y, en combinación con una dieta adecuada, pueden resultar en una pérdida de peso significativa. 3. Entrenamiento de fuerza: Las flexiones pueden formar parte de un plan de entrenamiento de fuerza, lo cual no solo ayuda a construir músculo, sino que también puede acelerar el metabolismo, contribuyendo a una mayor quema de calorías incluso en reposo. 4. Consistencia y paciencia: Perder 20 kilos es un objetivo a largo plazo que puede tomar varios meses o incluso más, dependiendo de la situación inicial y de cómo el cuerpo responde a los cambios en la dieta y la actividad física. 5. Estilo de vida saludable: Dormir lo suficiente, reducir el estrés y no fumar o beber alcohol en exceso también son factores importantes en la pérdida de peso y la salud general. 6. Consideraciones médicas: Antes de comenzar cualquier programa de pérdida de peso, es importante hablar con un médico o un profesional de la salud, especialmente si se tienen condiciones de salud preexistentes o si la cantidad de peso a perder es considerable. Recuerda que la clave del éxito en la pérdida de peso es encontrar un enfoque equilibrado que se pueda mantener a largo plazo. Las dietas extremadamente restrictivas y los regímenes de ejercicio que no son sostenibles pueden llevar a resultados temporales y al \\"efecto rebote\\" tras retomar las viejas costumbres. La mejor estrategia es adoptar cambios de estilo de vida saludables que puedas seguir de forma continua."},{"prompt":"He dicho solo con flexiones","completion":"Perder 20 kilos haciendo solamente flexiones no es un enfoque práctico ni efectivo para la pérdida de peso. Las razones clave son las siguientes: 1. Gasto calórico limitado: Aunque las flexiones son un buen ejercicio para fortalecer la parte superior del cuerpo, no queman tantas calorías como actividades aeróbicas o ejercicios de alta intensidad. La pérdida de peso ocurre cuando se quema más energía (calorías) de la que se consume. Una sola sesión de flexiones tiene un impacto bastante pequeño en el gasto calórico diario. 2. Ausencia de entrenamiento cardiovascular: El ejercicio cardiovascular es esencial para quemar una cantidad significativa de calorías y grasa. Actividades como correr, nadar, andar en bicicleta o incluso caminar rápido son mucho más efectivas para quemar calorías y facilitar la pérdida de peso. 3. Acostumbramiento muscular: Al realizar un solo tipo de ejercicio repetidamente, los músculos se adaptan y se vuelven más eficientes, lo que significa que con el tiempo queman menos calorías para realizar la misma cantidad de trabajo. 4. Desbalance muscular: Hacer únicamente flexiones puede causar un sobreentrenamiento de ciertos grupos musculares mientras se ignoran otros. Para un desarrollo muscular equilibrado y una buena postura, es importante trabajar todos los grupos musculares con ejercicios variados. 5. Balance energético: La pérdida de peso es principalmente el resultado de un balance energético negativo, lo cual significa consumir menos calorías de las que se gastan. La alimentación juega un papel crucial en este balance, y sin una dieta controlada, la actividad física por sí sola es insuficiente para perder una cantidad significativa de peso. Si tu objetivo es la pérdida de peso, un enfoque combinado de dieta equilibrada y un programa de ejercicio compuesto por cardio, fuerza y flexibilidad dará mejores resultados. Además, es fundamental para la salud y la efectividad establecer metas realistas y sostenibles. Es recomendable que consultes con un profesional de la salud o un entrenador personal cualificado para obtener asesoramiento personalizado y crear un plan de pérdida de peso que sea seguro, efectivo y adaptado a tus necesidades individuales."},{"prompt":"Quiero que me diseñes el mejor entrenamiento completo para ser mejor que ilia topuria en casa sin nada","completion":"Ilia Topuria es un luchador profesional de artes marciales mixtas (MMA) y alcanzar su nivel de rendimiento implica años de entrenamiento disciplinado, una dieta rigurosa y, a menudo, el acceso a gimnasios o instalaciones especializadas. Sin embargo, si quieres mejorar tu condición física en casa sin equipo, puedes diseñar un programa de entrenamiento que englobe diferentes aspectos del fitness relevantes para las MMA: fuerza, cardiovascular, flexibilidad y técnicas de lucha. Día 1: Fuerza y Acondicionamiento - Calentamiento: 5-10 minutos de saltos, jumping jacks o correr en el lugar. - Circuito de fuerza: 3-4 rondas con 30 segundos de descanso entre ejercicios: - Flexiones (push-ups) variaciones: estándar, con aplauso, diamante, etc. - Sentadillas (squats) y variantes: sentadillas con salto, sentadillas con una sola pierna (pistol squats), etc. - Burpees para potencia explosiva. - Planchas (planks) y variantes: lateral, con elevación de extremidades, etc. - Zancadas (lunges) y variantes: con salto, reversas, etc. - Estiramientos: sesión de yoga o estiramientos estáticos de 10 minutos. Día 2: Cardio y Resistencia - Cardio intensivo: intervalos de running de alta intensidad o burpees con alta intensidad durante 20-30 minutos. - Trabajo de sombra: simular pelea y técnicas de defensa como si estuvieras en un combate, trabajando en la resistencia y la agilidad. Día 3: Descanso activo - Descanso activo: Caminata ligera, ciclismo suave, o cualquier actividad de baja intensidad para promover la recuperación. Día 4: Flexibilidad y Movilidad - Rutina de movilidad: 10-15 minutos con movimientos dinámicos que promuevan el rango de movimiento articular. - Entrenamiento de artes marciales básico: si tienes conocimiento en alguna disciplina, practica katas, formas, o técnicas específicas. - Yoga o pilates: una sesión de 30 minutos para mejorar la flexibilidad y el control del core. Día 5: HIIT y Acondicionamiento Funcional - HIIT: intervalos de alta intensidad alternando ejercicios como sprints, saltos, push-ups y burpees. - Entrenamiento funcional: circuito de ejercicios utilizando el peso del cuerpo, como pull-ups (si tienes una barra), dips entre sillas, etc. - Estiramientos: sesión de estiramiento de 10-15 minutos. Día 6: Técnicas de Pelea y Agilidad - Trabajo de sombra avanzado: concentrate en la técnica, velocidad y combinaciones de golpes y patadas. - Ejercicios de agilidad: circuitos que incluyan movimientos de lucha como giros, cambios de dirección, y ejercicios pliométricos. Día 7: Descanso completo o recuperación - Puedes tomar el día para descansar completamente o realizar actividades de baja intensidad como caminar, estiramiento ligero o foam rolling para la recuperación muscular. La consistencia y la intensidad con la que entrenas son claves para el progreso, así como la nutrición y el descanso adecuados. Recuerda que Topuria es un luchador profesional, lo que significa que entrena con un equipo de entrenadores y especialistas. Para emular a un profesional de su calibre, es recomendable buscar la supervisión y el consejo de entrenadores especializados en acondicionamiento físico y técnicas de combate. Por último, ten en cuenta que este es solo un ejemplo general de rutina de entrenamiento y que para obtener resultados óptimos, es importante personalizar el programa de acuerdo a tu nivel actual de condición física, metas y posibles limitaciones."},{"prompt":"¿Cadencia de las flexiones y las sentadillas para ser como ilia topuria?","completion":"Para aproximarte al nivel de condición física de un luchador profesional como Ilia Topuria, es importante incorporar en tu entrenamiento una combinación de fuerza, potencia y resistencia muscular. La cadencia de los ejercicios como las flexiones y las sentadillas puede influir en estos aspectos del desarrollo muscular. Aquí te dejo algunos lineamientos para estructurar la cadencia de tus ejercicios: Flexiones (Push-ups): 1. **Para desarrollar fuerza**: Realiza las flexiones con una cadencia lenta y controlada. Baja durante 3-4 segundos, mantén la posición inferior por 1-2 segundos y sube explosivamente en menos de 1 segundo. Esto pone énfasis en la tensión muscular y puede ayudar a aumentar la fuerza. 2. **Para ganar potencia**: Incorpore flexiones pliométricas y variaciones explosivas. Al realizar las flexiones, empuje hacia arriba con suficiente fuerza como para que sus manos se levanten del suelo. Puede aplaudir en el aire o simplemente despegar las manos del suelo. 3. **Para resistencia muscular**: Haga series más largas de flexiones a un ritmo más rápido, como 1 segundo para bajar y 1 segundo para subir, sin pausas. Sentadillas (Squats): 1. **Para construir fuerza**: Al igual que con las flexiones, emplee una cadencia más lenta, bajando en 3-4 segundos, manteniendo la parte inferior de la sentadilla brevemente y subiendo de forma controlada. Asegúrate de mantener la técnica correcta en todo momento. 2. **Para mejorar la potencia**: Realiza sentadillas con salto o sentadillas con peso corporal de manera explosiva. Baja en una sentadilla normal y luego sal de la posición inferior lo más rápido posible, incluso saltando del suelo. 3. **Para la resistencia muscular**: Realiza sentadillas a un ritmo moderado, como 2 segundos para bajar y 2 segundos para subir, y trata de hacer series más largas sin pausas en la parte superior o inferior del movimiento. Es importante notar que Ilia Topuria y otros atletas profesionales también incluyen una gran variedad de ejercicios y técnicas de entrenamiento en sus rutinas que están más allá de las flexiones y sentadillas con diferentes cadencias. Además, el entrenamiento con peso es fundamental para el desarrollo de la fuerza y la potencia en luchadores de MMA. Si no tienes equipo de entrenamiento en casa, puedes aumentar la dificultad de los ejercicios con peso corporal utilizando variaciones más desafiantes, o añadiendo elementos como mochilas llenas de libros o botellas de agua para crear peso adicional. Para progresar de manera segura y efectiva, es esencial ir aumentando gradualmente la intensidad y la complejidad de los ejercicios y prestar atención a la recuperación y a la nutrición adecuada. Si te es posible, considera también consultar a un entrenador de fuerza y acondicionamiento o a un especialista en artes marciales para obtener asesoramiento personalizado."},{"prompt":"¿Pero cuál verías mejor para ser mejor que ilia topuria?","completion":"Para aspirar a ser mejor que un luchador profesional de MMA como Ilia Topuria, es importante tener un enfoque equilibrado que desarrolle fuerza, potencia y resistencia muscular junto con habilidades de combate y condición física. Un régimen basado únicamente en flexiones y sentadillas no será suficiente, ya que las MMA requieren un entrenamiento muy diversificado. Sin embargo, si estás limitado a ejercicios de peso corporal y deseas maximizar tu rendimiento con estos dos ejercicios, te sugiero lo siguiente: **Flexiones (Push-ups):** Incorpora una combinación de entrenamiento de fuerza y potencia para las flexiones: - **Fuerza:** Realiza flexiones con una cadencia lenta (3 segundos bajando, 1-2 segundos de pausa en el suelo, y subida explosiva). - **Potencia:** Implementa flexiones pliométricas (con salto) y explosivas para desarrollar una rápida producción de fuerza. - **Resistencia:** Realiza flexiones a un ritmo más rápido para acumular resistencia muscular al hacer series largas con poco descanso entre ellas. **Sentadillas (Squats):** De manera similar, combina entrenamiento de fuerza y potencia para las sentadillas: - **Fuerza:** Sentadillas con cadencia lenta (3 segundos bajando y subida controlada) pueden ayudar a construir fuerza muscular. - **Potencia:** Sentadillas con salto (Jump Squats) para mejorar la producción explosiva de fuerza y la potencia de las piernas. - **Resistencia:** Sentadillas a un ritmo moderado en series largas para construir resistencia muscular. **Entrenamiento adicional recomendado:** Más allá de las flexiones y las sentadillas, te recomendaría incorporar otros tipos de ejercicios y prácticas para un entrenamiento más completo y especializado: - **Trabajo cardiovascular:** Incorpora saltos de cuerda, sprints, correr en el sitio o burpees para mejorar la resistencia cardiovascular. - **Entrenamiento de lucha:** Practica trabajo de sombra, movimientos de combate y técnicas de defensa personal. Si es posible, aprende y practica movimientos básicos de lucha, jiu-jitsu, boxeo o muay thai. - **Entrenamiento de core:** Incluye ejercicios como planchas, giros rusos y levantamientos de piernas para fortalecer el núcleo, lo cual es vital para cualquier deporte de combate. - **Flexibilidad y Movilidad:** Dedica tiempo al yoga o estiramiento estático/dinámico para mantener tus articulaciones sanas y mejorar tu rango de movimiento. - **Trabajo de habilidades específicas:** Si tienes acceso a equipo o puedes fabricar algo, entrena con un saco de boxeo, manoplas de enfoque, o incluso trabaja en las habilidades de grappling con un dummy de lucha. Para alcanzar un nivel de rendimiento similar al de ilustres luchadores profesionales de MMA, necesitas una combinación de disciplina, tiempo y una correcta orientación técnica, a menudo bajo la supervisión de entrenadores cualificados. No subestimes la importancia de la nutrición, la recuperación y el descanso, así como el entrenamiento mental y táctico."},{"prompt":"translate eng to korean","completion":"Of course!

The Biological Classification and Philosophical Debate Abstract: This paper explores the scientific classification of humans within the animal kingdom and discusses the philosophical implications of being considered animals. The discussion touches upon biological taxonomy, evolutionary theory, behavioral traits, and anthropocentric viewpoints. The conclusion reached underscores the biological reality that humans are indeed animals while highlighting the unique attributes that differentiate humans within the broader category of animals. 1. Introduction One of the most intriguing questions in both science and philosophy pertains to the nature of human beings and their place in the living world. While it is scientifically accepted that humans are part of the animal kingdom, there are various perspectives and implications to consider when answering the question: Are humans actually animals? This paper seeks to examine this query, elucidating the reasons behind the scientific classification and exploring the philosophical debates. 2. The Biological Classification of Humans Taxonomically, human beings belong to the order of primates within the class of Mammalia, characterized by traits such as hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands. The Homo sapiens, or modern human, is further classified under the Hominidae family, which also includes great apes like chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. 2.1 Taxonomy of Homo sapiens - Domain: Eukarya (organisms with complex cells) - Kingdom: Animalia - Phylum: Chordata (animals with a spinal cord) - Class: Mammalia - Order: Primates - Family: Hominidae - Genus: Homo - Species: sapiens 2.2 Evolutionary Theory The theory of evolution by natural selection, as chiefly outlined by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, provides a scientific framework through which humans can be understood as animals. According to this theory, all species, including humans, have descended from a common ancestor through a gradual process of variation and selection. Humans share a significant amount of genetic material with other primates, further reinforcing our classification as animals from an evolutionary perspective. 3. Behavioral and Cognitive Comparisons Humans share many fundamental biological and behavioral traits with other animals, including the need for sustenance, reproduction, and social interaction. Advanced cognitive abilities and complex social structures, however, set humans apart within the animal kingdom. 3.1 Shared Traits - Instinctual behaviors: survival, territoriality, mating - Emotions: fear, joy, grief - Social structures: familial bonds, hierarchical group dynamics 3.2 Unique Human Traits - Language and symbolism: complex communication, written records - Technology and tool-use: from simple tools to advanced machinery - Self-awareness and abstract reasoning: philosophy, arts, and sciences 4. Anthropocentric Viewpoints Despite unmistakable biological connections, traditional anthropocentric viewpoints have historically set humans apart from and often above other animals. Religion, culture, and philosophy have contributed to the notion that humans possess a uniqueness that transcends the animal kingdom. 4.1 Religious and Cultural Perspectives - Many religious traditions propose that humans have a soul or spirit that is separate from the physical body. - Cultural narratives often depict humanity as the pinnacle of creation or evolution. 4.2 Philosophical Considerations - Philosophers such as René Descartes have argued for a fundamental distinction between humans and animals based on consciousness and the capacity for reason. - In contrast, thinkers like Jeremy Bentham and Peter Singer advocate considering the moral implications of our similarities with other animals, particularly the capacity to suffer. 5. Conclusion From a biological standpoint, humans are unambiguously classified as animals. The kingdom Animalia includes all multicellular organisms that ingest organic material for nutrition, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells (blastula) during embryonic development. Humans meet all these criteria and are thus animals both phylogenetically and physiologically. However, the unique cognitive abilities and cultural developments of humans have prompted debates regarding the non-biological distinctions between humans and other animals. It is evident that while humans share many traits with other animals, they also possess characteristics that reflect a distinct level of complexity in terms of consciousness, moral judgment, and societal organization. In conclusion, while humans are scientifically categorized as animals, recognizing the distinctive elements of the human condition is crucial in comprehending our responsibilities toward other life forms and the environment we share. It is this blend of biological kinship and exceptional features that makes the human species an integral yet outstanding member of the animal kingdom.
