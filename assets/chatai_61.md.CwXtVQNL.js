One day the gentlemen came to the club, and each pair of acquaintances shook hands (once).

There are 20 gentlemen, and we need to determine the maximum number of handshakes that can occur, given that no three gentlemen are all mutually acquainted. This implies no subset of three gentlemen can all know each other, forming a clique of size 3. **Step 2:** Establish the graph theory context. We can model the problem with an undirected graph ( G ) where each vertex represents a gentleman, and an edge between two vertices represents mutual acquaintance. The problem states that ( G ) contains no triangles (no ( K_3 ) subgraph). **Step 3:** Use Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives an upper limit on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph. Specifically, Turán's theorem for ( K_3 ) (denoted as ( T(2, n) )) tells us the maximum number of edges ( E ) in a graph with ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ( K_3 ) is [ E leq leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ] Given ( n = 20 ) for our problem: [ E leq leftlfloor frac{20^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{400}{4} rightrfloor = 100 ] **Step 4:** Verify the calculation. [ leftlfloor frac{20^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 rightrfloor = 100 ] Thus, the upper bound is 100 handshakes. **Step 5:** Construct a scenario to achieve this number. We can divide the 20 gentlemen into two groups of 10. Suppose: - Group A: ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{10}} ) - Group B: ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{10}} ) Each gentleman in Group A knows all gentlemen in Group B, but no gentleman within Group A knows another within the same group, and similarly for Group B. This configuration ensures every possible handshake occurs between the groups and none within a single group. - Handshakes between A and B: ( 10 times 10 = 100 ) - Handshakes within groups: (0) (no mutual acquaintances within Group A or Group B) Thus, we achieve the maximum number of 100 handshakes with 20 gentlemen. **Conclusion:** The maximum number of handshakes that can be achieved is [ boxed{100} ]"},{"prompt":"Alyssa traveled a total of 108 miles in 2 hours.

This assumption is valid because decreasing x_1 can only make the inequality easier to satisfy. - Assume x_n = 0. Similarly, this assumption works because increasing x_n would make the right-hand side larger, making the inequality harder to satisfy. 2. **Simplified Inequality:** With these assumptions, the inequality we are trying to prove simplifies to: [ 1 cdot left(1 - x_{i+1}right) geq frac{1}{4} cdot 1 cdot (1 - 0) ] Which can be rewritten as: [ 1 - x_{i+1} geq frac{1}{4}. ] Therefore, we need to show that there exists an i such that: [ x_{i+1} leq frac{3}{4}. ] 3. **Choosing an Appropriate i:** We now seek an appropriate index i to satisfy the inequality. - Consider the sequence x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n. - We are given that x_1 = 1 and x_n = 0. - Define i as the largest index such that x_i > frac{1}{2}. 4. **Verification of Conditions:** By definition of i, we have: [ x_{i} > frac{1}{2}. ] Furthermore, for i to be the largest index such that x_i > frac{1}{2}, it follows that: [ x_{i+1} leq frac{1}{2}. ] 5. **Final Calculation:** Using the found i, consider: [ x_{i} left(1 - x_{i+1}right). ] Since x_i > frac{1}{2} and x_{i+1} leq frac{1}{2}, we calculate: [ 1 left(1 - x_{i+1}right) geq 1 left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) = 1 cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}. ] We also need: [ frac{1}{4} x_1 (1 - x_n) = frac{1}{4} cdot 1 cdot 1 = frac{1}{4}. ] 6. **Conclusion:** By comparison, we see that: [ 1 left(1 - x_{i+1}right) geq frac{1}{2} > frac{1}{4}. ] Therefore, the inequality holds for the chosen index i.

Thus, m(x) is decreasing on (frac{1}{e}, frac{1}{e-1}) and increasing on (frac{1}{e-1}, 1). Since m(frac{1}{e}) = 0 and m(1) = 0, we have m(x) < 0 for frac{1}{e} < x < 1, implying h(x) < 0.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pipe if it were solid (without the hollow part). The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length in this case). The external radius (R) of the pipe is half of the external diameter, so R = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm.

The internal radius (r) of the pipe is the external radius minus the thickness, so r = 4 cm - 1 cm = 3 cm. The volume of the hollow part (V_hollow) is: V_hollow = πr²h V_hollow = π(3 cm)²(21 cm) V_hollow = π(9 cm²)(21 cm) V_hollow = π(189 cm³) V_hollow = 189π cm³ The volume of the iron used to make the pipe (V_iron) is the volume of the solid cylinder minus the volume of the hollow part: V_iron = V_solid - V_hollow V_iron = 1056π cm³ - 189π cm³ V_iron = (1056 - 189)π cm³ V_iron = 867π cm³ Now, we can find the weight of the pipe by multiplying the volume of the iron by the weight of iron per cubic centimeter: Weight = V_iron * weight of iron per cm³ Weight = 867π cm³ * 8 g/cm³ Since π is approximately 3.1416, we can calculate the weight as follows: Weight ≈ 867 * 3.1416 * 8 g Weight ≈ 2736.1416 g Therefore, the weight of the pipe is approximately boxed{2736.1416} grams."},{"prompt":"Some squares of an n times n chessboard have been marked ( n in N^* ).

This can be illustrated as follows: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = S ] Here, ( S ) is the sum of the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, n } initially written on the blackboard. 2. Each transformation replaces p and q with p+q and |p-q|. Notice: [ (p+q) + |p-q| = 2 max(p, q) ] Hence, the sum S remains unchanged. 3. The claim is that after several such transformations, the numbers on the board eventually become k, which could be a power of 2, specifically, k = 2^s where s in mathbb{N}. To understand why k must be a power of 2, consider the nature of the process. Each replacement operation either maintains or combines the numbers in such a way that eventually, non-negative integers that also sum to S must reduce down via multiples. 4. Since 1 is initially on the board and cannot be a multiple of any d>1 other than 1 itself, the transformations effectively chain the replacements towards multiples of powers of 2. The only way to proceed further is by powers of 2, as all other forms will eventually reduce to binary representation components due to the arithmetic nature of transformation. 5. The fact that k must be at least n is justified because as we transform pairs of numbers on the board, the largest number encountered will grow. However, it should still be greater or equal to the sum constraints set by initial sums, explaining why k geq n. 6. Furthermore, with the inherent binary nature explained, proving k = 2^s geq n is straightforward. Each arithmetic process aims to balance out making up to the highest possible multiples of 2, eventually aligning k as the nearest power of 2 that fits the sum constraints. # Conclusion: The solution concludes that k can take any power of 2 that is not less than n, given by: [ k = 2^s text{ where } 2^s geq n ] Thus, the value of ( k ) is confirmed as any power of 2 greater than or equal to ( n ): [ boxed{k = 2^s, text{ where } 2^s geq n} ]"},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} whose common difference and first term are both not equal to 0, and a_2, a_4, a_8 form a geometric sequence, then dfrac{a_1+a_5+a_9}{a_2+a_3}= () A: 2 B: 3 C: 5 D: 7","completion":"Since the arithmetic sequence {a_n} has a common difference and first term both not equal to 0, and a_2, a_4, a_8 form a geometric sequence, therefore a_4^2=a_2a_8, therefore (a_1+3d)^2=(a_1+d)(a_1+7d), therefore d^2=a_1d, Since d neq 0, therefore d=a_1, therefore dfrac{a_1+a_5+a_9}{a_2+a_3}= dfrac{15a_1}{5a_1}=3． Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}． By utilizing the fact that the arithmetic sequence {a_n} has a common difference and first term both not equal to 0, and a_2, a_4, a_8 form a geometric sequence, we can deduce that d=a_1, which allows us to calculate dfrac{a_1+a_5+a_9}{a_2+a_3}． This problem tests the properties of arithmetic sequences and examines the students' computational skills, which is quite basic."},{"prompt":"Suppose there are two numbers, x and y, for which the product of each with 12 is increased by 198 and 176, respectively.

From the first equation, we can express x in terms of 198: 12x = -198 (since we are looking for the original number before the increase of 198) x = -198 / 12 x = -16.5 From the second equation, we can express y in terms of 176: 12y = -176 (since we are looking for the original number before the increase of 176) y = -176 / 12 y = -14.666... However, these values for x and y do not add up to 29, which means there must be a mistake in our initial setup. Let's correct the setup: The correct equations should be: 12x + 198 = 12y + 176 x + y = 29 Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can isolate x: 12x - 12y = 176 - 198 12x - 12y = -22 x - y = -22 / 12 x - y = -11/6 Now we have a system of two equations: x + y = 29 x - y = -11/6 Let's solve this system by adding the two equations together to eliminate y: 2x = 29 - 11/6 2x = (29*6 - 11) / 6 2x = (174 - 11) / 6 2x = 163 / 6 x = (163 / 6) / 2 x = 163 / 12 x = 13.583... Now that we have x, we can find y by substituting x back into one of the original equations: x + y = 29 13.583... + y = 29 y = 29 - 13.583... y = 15.416... So the values of x and y are approximately: x ≈ 13.583 (or 163/12) y ≈ 15.417 (or 185/12) These values should satisfy both the condition that their sum is boxed{29} and the condition related to their products with 12 being increased by 198 and 176, respectively."},{"prompt":"Given two distinct circles in the plane, let ( n ) be the number of common tangent lines that can be drawn to these two circles.

If A_{1}B_{1} is parallel to the bisector of angle B , prove that A_{2}C_{2} is parallel to the bisector of angle C . *Proposed by S. Berlov*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a circle with the same center as the circumcircle of triangle (ABC). This circle intersects the sides of the triangle at six points, forming a convex hexagon (A_1A_2B_1B_2C_1C_2). We need to prove that if (A_1B_1) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle B), then (A_2C_2) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle C). 2. **Replacing Circumcenter with Incenter:** Let's consider the incenter (I) of (triangle ABC) instead of the circumcenter. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle. 3. **Symmetry and Perpendicularity:** By symmetry, if (I) is the incenter, then the line (BI) (the angle bisector of (angle B)) is perpendicular to (A_1C_2). This is because the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle, and the angle bisectors are perpendicular to the lines connecting the points where the incircle touches the sides of the triangle. 4. **Condition and Implication:** Given that (A_1B_1) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle B), we have (A_1C_2 perp A_1B_1). This implies that (B_1C_2) is a diameter of the circle, as the perpendicularity condition suggests that (A_1C_2) and (A_1B_1) form a right angle. 5. **Conclusion:** Since (B_1C_2) is a diameter, (A_2C_2) must be perpendicular to (A_2B_1). Given that (A_2B_1) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle B), it follows that (A_2C_2) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle C).

The function is defined for x > 0 since the natural logarithm function, ln x, is undefined for x leq 0. Next, we find the first derivative of f(x) to locate potential extreme points: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{3}{2}x^2-ln xright) = 3x - frac{1}{x}. To find the critical points, we set f'(x) equal to zero: 3x - frac{1}{x} = 0. Multiplying by x to clear the fraction gives: 3x^2 - 1 = 0. Solving for x, we obtain: x = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. To determine whether this critical point corresponds to an extreme value, we can either use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative. Let's use the latter method. For x in (0, frac{sqrt{3}}{3}), we have f'(x) < 0, meaning the function is decreasing. For x in (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating the function is increasing. Thus, we conclude that at x = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, the function reaches a local minimum.

With 12 matchsticks, the total length of all the sticks is: [ 12 times 2 = 24 , mathrm{cm} ] 2. **Choose a Suitable Polygon**: To form a polygon with a known area using all the matchsticks without breaking any, let's try forming a regular polygon. One suitable option is forming a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon is chosen because it satisfies the conditions optimally (as regular polygons are generally easy to work with, ensuring proper utilization of stick lengths). 3. **Verification of Regular Hexagon**: For a regular hexagon, each side length is equal. Thus, if we use all the matchsticks to form a hexagon, each side of the hexagon would be: [ frac{24 , mathrm{cm}}{6} = 4 , mathrm{cm} ] However, given each matchstick is only 2 , mathrm{cm}, this seems infeasible as described.

At this point, Xiao Hua's marbles count would be 11 times that of Xiao Jun's marbles count: [ y + 2 = 11(x - 2) ] We now have two equations based on the problem's conditions: [ y - 4 = 2(x + 4) ] [ y + 2 = 11(x - 2) ] Let's simplify both equations one by one.

According to the information given: - The wide cupboard can hold twice as many glasses as the tall cupboard, so it holds 2T glasses. - The narrow cupboard can hold 15 glasses, with the glasses divided equally among the three shelves. Since one shelf broke, we can assume that the narrow cupboard now holds 10 glasses (because 15 divided by 3 shelves is 5 glasses per shelf, and with one shelf broken, only 2 shelves are left, so 2 shelves * 5 glasses per shelf = 10 glasses). Now, we need to find out how many glasses the tall cupboard can hold (T). We know that the total number of glasses in all cupboards is equal to the sum of glasses in the tall, wide, and narrow cupboards: T (tall) + 2T (wide) + 10 (narrow) = Total glasses Since the narrow cupboard originally held 15 glasses divided equally among three shelves, each shelf would hold 5 glasses.

The focus F has coordinates (c, 0). - Substituting x = c into y^{2} = 4cx gives y^{2} = 4c^{2}, so |y| = 2c. Thus, the chord length |CD| = 4c. - Substituting x = c into the equation of the ellipse C_1 gives y^{2} = b^{2}(1 - frac{c^{2}}{a^{2}}) = frac{b^{4}}{a^{2}}, so |y| = frac{b^{2}}{a}. Therefore, the chord length |AB| = frac{2b^{2}}{a}. - Given that |CD| = frac{4}{3}|AB|, we have 4c = frac{4}{3} cdot frac{2b^{2}}{a}, which simplifies to 3ac = 2b^{2} = 2(a^{2} - c^{2}). - Solving 2c^{2} + 3ac - 2a^{2} = 0 for e, where e = frac{c}{a}, we get 2e^{2} + 3e - 2 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for e gives e = frac{1}{2}.

Since ( r, -s > 0 ), the sequences ({a_i^r}) and ({a_i^{-s}}) are also geometric progressions with finite sums. Take suitable ( a_1 ) and common ratio, so that the series of ({a_i^r}) has a sum at most ( 2023 ), which is at most ( 2023n^t ). But then ({b_n}) is upper bounded by the sum of the series of ({a_i^{-s}}), giving a contradiction. - ( t < 0 ) works: Sending ( n rightarrow infty ), as ( 2023 cdot n^t rightarrow 0 ), we can never have a sequence of positive reals satisfying the first condition. Hence, the assertion holds true. 3. **Case when ( rs = 0 ):** - ( s = 0 ): The answer is all ( t in mathbb{R} ) work. This is because ({b_n = n}) for any sequence ({a_i}), which anyways diverges. - ( r = 0 ): The answer is precisely all ( t < 1 ) work. This is because if ( t geq 1 ), then any sequence ({a_i}) satisfies the first condition and hence taking ({a_i^{-s}}) as a geometric progression with a finite sum gives a contradiction to the second condition.

Thus, we focus on the factors of ( (x + 1)(x + y) ): - ( x ) is a factor of ( x^2 ); hence, any prime factor ( p ) of ( x^2 ) is also a factor of ( x ). - If ( p ) were also a factor of ( x + 1 ), then ( p ) would divide ( (x + 1) - x = 1 ), which is impossible since ( p ) must be greater than 1. This implies that ( x ) and ( x + 1 ) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). 3. **Applying Gauss's Lemma:** According to Gauss's Lemma (which states that if ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime and ( a ) divides ( bc ), then ( a ) must divide ( c ) if ( a ) is prime), we can apply the lemma because ( x^2 ) and ( x + 1 ) are coprime: [ text{Since } x^2 | (x + 1)(x + y) text{ and } gcd(x^2, x + 1) = 1, text{ it must be that } x^2 | (x + y). ] 4. **Conclusion:** Hence, ( x^2 ) indeed divides ( x + y ), which completes the proof.

We can fill alternate squares in rows and skip entire columns to prevent vertical and diagonal alignment of four X’s: - Place X's in these positions: (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (1,4), (2,1). 5. **Verification**: - Rows: No row has more than three X's. - Columns: No column has more than two X's. - Diagonals: No diagonal has more than three X's. 6. **Conclusion**: By adjusting placements and given the structure of a 3 times 5 grid, placing 10 X's is feasible without aligning four in a line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Points Q and R are the points symmetric to S with respect to lines CA and CB, respectively. We aim to prove that P, Q, R, and C are concyclic, i.e., they lie on the same circle. 1. **Prove Cyclic Nature of Points**: - Observe that P, A, B, C are concyclic points by definition. - Similarly, P, A_1, B_1, C are concyclic. 2. **Angle Relationships**: - Consider angle PAC. Note that angle PAC = 180^circ - angle PBC due to the cyclic nature of A, B, P, C. - Similarly, from the cyclic nature of P, A_1, B_1, C, angle PA_1C = 180^circ - angle PB_1C. 3. **Triangle Similarity**: - Notice angle PAB = angle PA_1B_1.

We know that a + b + c = 444. 2. **Geometric Progression Relationship:** Since the peanuts form a geometric progression, there exists a common ratio r such that b = ar and c = br = ar^2. 3. **Eating Peanuts:** After eating, Alex has a' = a - 5, Betty has b' = b - 9, and Charlie has c' = c - 25. The total number of peanuts after eating is a' + b' + c' = 405 (since 444 - 39 = 405). 4. **Arithmetic Progression Relationship:** Since a', b', and c' form an arithmetic progression, there exists a common difference d such that b' = a' + d and c' = b' + d. Therefore, c' = a' + 2d. 5. **Solving for b':** Adding the equations a' + b' + c' = 405, we get 3b' = 405, so b' = 135. 6. **Recovering b:** Since b' = b - 9, we find b = b' + 9 = 135 + 9 = 144. 7. **Using the Geometric Progression:** We have b = ar and c = ar^2. Substituting b = 144 into the total, a + b + c = 444, gives a + 144 + ar^2 = 444. 8. **Expressing a and c in terms of r:** We have a = frac{144}{r} and c = 144r.

Let's calculate it step-by-step: 1. Male lion is fed first. 2. Any of the 5 females can be fed next: 5 choices. 3. After one female is fed, there are now 4 males remaining: 4 choices. 4.

The volume of the sphere is given by the formula V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4}{3}pi R^3. According to the problem, this volume is 4sqrt{3}pi.

For symmetry about the origin, if (x, f(x)) is a point on the graph, then (-x, -f(x)) must also be a point on the graph. This implies that for x > 0, there must exist a corresponding x < 0 such that the function values are negatives of each other. Therefore, we set up the equation based on the piecewise definition of f(x): For x > 0, we have f(x) = ln x. For the symmetric point, we should have f(-x) = a(-x) + 1 = -ln x.

This eccentricity implies a specific relationship between a and b, which can be represented as frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}, where c is the distance from the center to either focus. Given this, we can assume the ellipse in the form frac{x^2}{4c^2} + frac{y^2}{3c^2} = 1, where a = 2c and b = sqrt{3}c. 2. **Triangle AF_1F_2 and Line DE**: The upper vertex A and the foci F_1 and F_2 form an equilateral triangle, which means all sides are equal, and angles are 60^circ.

[ x^{2022} + y = x^{2022} + (x^{2022} - x^{1747}) = 2x^{2022} - x^{1747} ] [ x^{1747} + 2y = x^{1747} + 2(x^{2022} - x^{1747}) = 2x^{2022} - x^{1747}. ] Thus, substituting into the original equation results in: [ f(2x^{2022} - x^{1747}) = f(2x^{2022} - x^{1747}) + f(x^{42}). ] 3. Subtract ( f(2x^{2022} - x^{1747}) ) from both sides to isolate ( f(x^{42}) ): [ 0 = f(x^{42}). ] Hence, ( f(x^{42}) = 0 ) for all ( x ). 4. Since this must hold for all ( x ) and noting that ( x^{42} ) covers all positive real values, ( f ) must be zero for all positive real numbers. That is: [ f(z) = 0 quad text{for all} quad z > 0. ] 5. Next, consider the case when ( y = 0 ). The original equation becomes: [ f(x^{2022}) = f(x^{1747}) + f(x^{42}). ] 6. Since we established that ( f(x^{42}) = 0 ), this simplifies to: [ f(x^{2022}) = f(x^{1747}). ] 7. In particular, consider negative values of ( x ). Since ( x^{1747} ) and ( x^{2022} ) are both positive when ( x neq 0 ), and knowing ( f(z) = 0 ) for positive ( z ), it follows that: [ f(x^{2022}) = 0 quad text{and} quad f(x^{1747}) = 0. ] 8. Consequently, ( f(x^{2022}) = f(x^{1747}) = 0 ) for all ( x neq 0 ). 9. Finally, since the functional equation holds for all ( x ) and ( y ), including when ( y = 0 ), we conclude that ( f ) must be identically zero for all ( x in mathbb{R} ): [ f(x) = 0 quad text{for all} quad x in mathbb{R}. ] **Conclusion**: The only function that satisfies the functional equation is the zero function: [ boxed{f(x) = 0 text{ for all } x in mathbb{R}}. ]"},{"prompt":"A right cylinder has a height of 8 inches and a radius of 3 inches.

Since ( 1 in mathcal{S} ) and all elements must be congruent to 1 mod ( n ), the largest element being 3003 means ( 3003 equiv 1 pmod{n} ).

Substituting the point (-2,sqrt{6}) into the hyperbola equation frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, we get: [ frac{(-2)^2}{a^2}-frac{(sqrt{6})^2}{b^2}=1 ] Simplifying, we have: [ frac{4}{a^2}-frac{6}{b^2}=1 ] 2.

Considering f(x_1) - f(x_2), begin{align*} f(x_1) - f(x_2) &= left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2^{x_1} + 1}right) - left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2^{x_2} + 1}right) &= frac{1}{2^{x_2} + 1} - frac{1}{2^{x_1} + 1} &= frac{2^{x_1} - 2^{x_2}}{(2^{x_1} + 1)(2^{x_2} + 1)} > 0 end{align*} Since f(x_1) > f(x_2) whenever x_1 > x_2, f(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}. Hence, boxed{text{f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R}}}. (3) Range of the real number m Given f(2m - msin x) + f(cos^2 x) geqslant 0 always holds, and f(x) is a monotonically increasing odd function on mathbb{R}, we have begin{align*} f(cos^2 x) &geqslant -f(2m - msin x) Rightarrow f(cos^2 x) &geqslant f(msin x - 2m) Rightarrow cos^2 x &geqslant msin x - 2m Rightarrow 1 - sin^2 x &geqslant msin x - 2m end{align*} This implies sin^2 x + msin x - 2m - 1 leqslant 0. Let t = sin x in [-1, 1], then g(t) = t^2 + mt - 2m - 1 must satisfy g(t) leqslant 0 for all t in [-1, 1]. This gives us begin{align*} g(-1) &= -3m leq 0 g(1) &= -m leq 0 end{align*} Thus, we find that m geq 0.

For frac n3 to be a perfect cube, n = 3 cdot k^3 for some integer k. Similarly, for frac n5 to be a perfect fifth power, n = 5 cdot j^5 for some integer j. To meet these three conditions simultaneously, we want: - n = 2^{a} cdot 3^{b} cdot 5^{c} where a, b, and c are chosen so that n/2 = m^2, n/3 = k^3, and n/5 = j^5 are all integers. For frac n2 = m^2, a-1 must be even, so a=2d+1. For frac n3 = k^3, b-1 must be a multiple of 3, so b=3e+1. And for frac n5 = j^5, c-1 must be a multiple of 5, so c=5f+1. To find the least n, we need 2^{2d+1} cdot 3^{3e+1} cdot 5^{5f+1}. The lowest powers that satisfy these conditions are d=2, e=1, and f=1.

Let's assume we have lamp posts numbered (1, 2, 3, ldots, n). 3. **Step 3:** Analyze the necessary condition for full illumination: - If you switch off any lamp post, the road must not be fully illuminated. In other words, each lamp post should contribute to the coverage in such a way that removing any one of them results in a dark segment. 4. **Step 4:** Suppose we turn off the lamp post at position (n+1): - We need to ensure that there is no overlap between the segments illuminated by (n)-th and ((n+2))-th lamp posts. If the illuminated segments by (n)-th and ((n+2))-th lamp posts overlap even partially, then turning off the (n+1)-th lamp post will not leave any part of the road dark, contradicting the problem’s condition. 5. **Step 5:** Thus, the segments illuminated by consecutive odd-numbered lamp posts (i.e., positions (1, 3, 5, ldots)) should not overlap. In a 1 km road, you cannot have more than 999 such segments (since each segment is 1 meter long, you can place 999 non-overlapping segments of 1 meter length in a 1000 meter segment). 6. **Step 6:** Calculate the maximum number of lamp posts: - For even-numbered lamp posts, if one segment of 1 meter is illuminated and the segments do not overlap, then you will require 1000 such lamp posts. But, if the illuminated segment overlaps with its adjacent segments slightly, then turning off any lamp post still ensures that the road is not fully lit. 7. **Step 7:** Understand the constraints: - For any arrangement to meet the non-overlapping condition after turning off any one lamp post, any set of sequential odd-numbered lamp posts cannot overlap. - If you were to include more, i.e., 1999 lamp posts, at least 1000 must be odd-numbered.

Let ( O ) be the midpoint of this square, and let ( P, Q, R, S ) be the midpoints of sides ( AB, BC, CD, ) and ( DA ) respectively. **Step 2: Partitioning the Square** We note that the square ( ABCD ) can be divided into four smaller squares using these midpoints. Specifically, the smaller squares will be: - ( APOS ) - ( BQOP ) - ( CROQ ) - ( DSOR ) Each of these four smaller squares has a side length of ( frac{1}{2} ). **Step 3: Calculating the Diameter of the Smaller Squares** The diameter (the longest distance between two points) of each smaller square can be found using the diagonal. The diagonal ( d ) of a square with side length ( s ) is given by: [ d = ssqrt{2} ] For our smaller squares, ( s = frac{1}{2} ): [ d = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] Therefore, the diameter of each of the four smaller squares is ( k = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). **Step 4: Pigeonhole Principle Application** Given any five points inside the original square ( ABCD ), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these smaller squares will contain at least two of the five points (since there are only four smaller squares and five points in total). **Step 5: Distance Analysis** The maximum distance between any two points in one of the smaller squares cannot exceed the diameter of that square, which is ( k = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). However, the distance cannot be exactly ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) because the points are within the interior of the square, not on the boundary.

Therefore, it is sufficient to show that: [ |cos alpha| + |cos beta| leq 1 + |cos alpha | cdot |cos beta|. ] 4. To prove this, we take into account the following: [ |cos alpha| + |cos beta| leq 1 + |cos alpha| cdot |cos beta| Leftrightarrow (1 - |cos alpha|)(1 - |cos beta|) geq 0. ] 5. Finally, consider the non-negativity of the product: [ (1 - |cos alpha|)(1 - |cos beta|) geq 0. ] This product is always non-negative because (|cos x| leq 1) for all (x), ensuring that both factors ((1 - |cos alpha|)) and ((1 - |cos beta|)) are non-negative. Thus: [ (1 - |cos alpha|)(1 - |cos beta|) geq 0. ] Conclusion: [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"The base of a prism is a square with a side length of ( a ).

We know that a third of the light bulbs in the foyer are broken, and there are 10 broken light bulbs in the foyer. This means that the total number of light bulbs in the foyer is 3 times the number of broken ones, which is 3 * 10 = 30 light bulbs in the foyer. Now, let's find out the total number of light bulbs in both the foyer and the kitchen. We know there are 35 light bulbs in the kitchen and 30 in the foyer, so the total is 35 + 30 = 65 light bulbs. We are told there are 34 light bulbs not broken in both the foyer and kitchen. Since there are 65 light bulbs in total and 34 are not broken, the number of broken light bulbs in both the foyer and kitchen is 65 - 34 = 31 broken light bulbs. We already know that 10 of these broken light bulbs are in the foyer, so the number of broken light bulbs in the kitchen must be 31 (total broken) - 10 (broken in the foyer) = 21 broken light bulbs in the kitchen. To find the fraction of broken light bulbs in the kitchen, we divide the number of broken light bulbs in the kitchen by the total number of light bulbs in the kitchen.

Is it always possible to find in this company two nonintersecting groups of 3 sousliks each such that in both groups all sousliks are friends?","completion":"1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph ( G ) with 7 vertices, where each vertex has a degree of 4. This means each souslik has exactly 4 friends. 2. **Existence of a Triangle**: We need to show that a triangle exists in this graph. Consider any vertex ( a ) with neighbors ( b, c, d, e ). Since ( b ) has 4 neighbors and there are only 6 vertices other than ( b ), ( b ) must have at least one neighbor among ( c, d, e ). Otherwise, ( b ) would have 4 neighbors outside of ( {a, b, c, d, e} ), which is impossible because there are only 7 vertices in total. Therefore, there must be an edge between two of ( b, c, d, e ). Without loss of generality, assume ( b ) and ( c ) are connected. Thus, ( a, b, c ) form a triangle ( T ). 3. **Remaining Vertices**: Let the remaining vertices be ( S = {d, e, f, g} ). 4. **Edges Between ( T ) and ( S )**: There are 6 edges between ( T ) and ( S ) because each vertex in ( T ) has 4 edges, and 3 of these edges are within ( T ) itself. Therefore, each vertex in ( T ) has one edge connecting to ( S ), resulting in ( 3 times 2 = 6 ) edges between ( T ) and ( S ). 5. **Edges Within ( S )**: Since each vertex in ( S ) has 4 edges and there are 4 vertices in ( S ), there are ( 4 times 4 = 16 ) edges ending in ( S ). Subtracting the 6 edges between ( T ) and ( S ), we have ( 16 - 6 = 10 ) edges starting and ending in ( S ). Since each edge is counted twice, there are ( frac{10}{2} = 5 ) edges fully contained in ( S ). 6. **Pigeonhole Principle**: By the pigeonhole principle, at least one vertex in ( S ) must have at least 3 neighbors within ( S ). Without loss of generality, assume ( d ) has three neighbors in ( S ), say ( e, f, g ). 7. **Existence of a Triangle in ( S )**: If no triangle exists in ( S ), then ( e, f, g ) cannot be neighbors with each other. This would result in only 3 edges fully contained in ( S ), which contradicts the earlier calculation that there are 5 edges within ( S ). Therefore, a triangle must exist in ( S ). 8. **Conclusion**: We have found two disjoint triangles, one in ( T ) and one in ( S ), as desired.

We know that Mo drinks an even number of cups of hot chocolate on rainy days, so let's denote the number of cups of hot chocolate Mo drinks on a rainy day as 2m, where m is an integer. From the information given, we can set up the following equations: 1. Total cups of drinks: (2mR + 3NR = 36) 2. Mo drank 12 more cups of tea than hot chocolate: (3NR - 2mR = 12) 3. Mo only drinks hot chocolate on an odd number of mornings: (R) is odd. We also know that there are 7 days in a week, so: 4.

The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. Since R is the number of rainy days and it must be odd, the possible values for R are 1, 3, or 9. However, since there are only 7 days in a week, R cannot be 9.

Since A and B are both acute angles, and the sine function is increasing in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}), it follows that if A > B, then sin A > sin B. Therefore, sin A > sin B is true, making option ① correct. **For option ②:** Given that A and B are acute angles in an acute triangle, we consider the behavior of the cosine function. The function y = cos x is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}). Thus, if A > B and both are within (0, frac{pi}{2}), then cos A < cos B. Hence, cos A < cos B is true, validating option ②. **For option ③:** In an acute triangle, the sum of any two angles is greater than frac{pi}{2}. Thus, A + B > frac{pi}{2}. Considering the interval for A and B, we have frac{pi}{2} > A > frac{pi}{2} - B > 0. This implies sin A > sin(frac{pi}{2} - B) = cos B.

Therefore, the smallest number which when increased by 3 is divisible by 18, 70, 100, and 84 is boxed{6297} ."},{"prompt":"Find all positive integers k that have the following property: for any positive integer n, 2^{(k1)n+1} times frac{(kn)!}{n!}.","completion":"To find all positive integers ( k ) such that for any positive integer ( n ), the expression ( 2^{(k-1)n+1} times frac{(kn)!}{n!} ) is an integer, we need to analyze the factors of 2 in the factorial expressions. 1. **Calculate the power of 2 in (frac{(kn)!}{n!}):** By the **Legendre's formula** (or de Polignac's formula), the exponent of a prime ( p ) (here ( p = 2 )) in ( n! ) is given by: [ e_p(n!) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^i} rightrfloor ] Applying this to ((kn)!) and (n!): [ e_2((kn)!) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{kn}{2^i} rightrfloor ] [ e_2(n!) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^i} rightrfloor ] So, the power of 2 in (frac{(kn)!}{n!}) is: [ e_2left(frac{(kn)!}{n!}right) = e_2((kn)!) - e_2(n!) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{kn}{2^i} rightrfloor - sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^i} rightrfloor ] 2. **Deriving the condition on ( k ):** For ( 2^{(k-1)n + 1} times frac{(kn)!}{n!} ) to be an integer, it must be that: [ sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{kn}{2^i} rightrfloor - sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^i} rightrfloor leq (k-1)n + 1 ] 3. **Simplification using sum of binary digits**: The number of times 2 divides ( n! ) can also be expressed as ( n - s(n) ), where ( s(n) ) is the sum of the binary digits of ( n ): [ sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^i} rightrfloor = n - s(n) ] Hence, we have: [ (kn - s(kn)) - (n - s(n)) leq (k-1)n + 1 ] This simplifies to: [ kn - s(kn) - n + s(n) leq (k-1)n + 1 ] Simplifying further, we get: [ n - s(kn) + s(n) leq 1 ] Therefore, we need: [ s(kn) geq s(n) ] 4. **Solution for ( k ):** - If ( k ) is a power of 2, i.e., ( k = 2^a ), then ( s(k n) = s(2^a n) = s(n) ) for any ( n ). - For ( k ) which are not powers of 2, consider ( k = 2^a cdot m ) where ( m ) is an odd integer greater than 1.

Let ( A_2, B_2, C_2 ) be the midpoints of the sides ( CB, BA, AC ) of triangle ( ABC ), respectively. This setup allows us to use symmetry and midpoint properties effectively in our proof. 2. Since ( O ) is the center of the circumscribed circle around ( triangle ABC ), by definition, ( OA, OB, OC ) are radii of that circle. Due to the symmetry, ( OA_2 ) is perpendicular to ( BC ), that is, ( OA_2 perp BC ). 3. Next, note the symmetry involved: the points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) are symmetric to ( O ) with respect to the sides ( BC, CA, AB ), respectively. This symmetry implies that lines ( B_1C_1 parallel BC ), ( C_1A_1 parallel CA ), and ( A_1B_1 parallel AB ). 4. The symmetry of ( A_1 ) with respect to ( BC ) means ( O ) is vertically aligned with ( A_1 ) and perpendicular to the line segment ( B_1C_1 ) (since ( B_1C_1 parallel BC )). Thus, ( OA_1 perp B_1C_1 ). It follows that ( OA_1 ) is an altitude of triangle ( A_1B_1C_1 ). 5.

To show that all altitudes of ( triangle ABC ) pass through the circumcenter of ( triangle A_1B_1C_1 ), consider the altitudes of ( triangle ABC ). Since ( O ) is the center of the circumscribed circle of ( triangle ABC ) and its altitudes intersect at ( H ), where ( H ) is the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ), we need to show that the circumcircle of ( triangle A_1B_1C_1 ) has the same circumcenter ( O ) and thus ( H ). 7. We observe that the lines connecting the midpoints ( B_2C_2, A_2C_2, A_2B_2 ) form a parallelogram with the segments ( B_1C_1, C_1A_1, A_1B_1 ). This property indicates that points ( B_1, C_1 ) respectively belong to median ( BC ) of ( ABC ), hence preserving ratios and geometry. 8.

Since alpha is an acute angle, we only consider the positive value for the tangent.

This means that ( MA = MB ). 3. **Formation of Triangle ( AMB ):** Since ( M ) is equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ), we denote the lengths as: [ MA = MB ] Consequently, ( triangle AMB ) is an isosceles triangle with ( AM = BM ). 4. **Median and Perpendicular Bisector:** The median from ( M ) to ( AB ) will also be the altitude because ( triangle AMB ) is isosceles. Let's denote the midpoint of ( AB ) as ( C ). 5. **Altitude as Median:** In an isosceles triangle ( triangle AMB ), the altitude from ( M ) to ( AB ) will also be the median ( MC ) because it splits ( angle AMB ) into two equal angles, and splits ( AB ) into two equal segments: [ AC = CB ] Therefore, ( MC ) is also the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ). 6. **Perpendicular bisector property:** By definition and property of the perpendicular bisector of a line segment, every point ( M ) on the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) is equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ). 7. **Conclusion:** This establishes that every point ( M ) which is equidistant from the endpoints ( A ) and ( B ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ).

However, due to regional differences, 10% of the houses on Side_B are uninhabitable. Additionally, environmental constraints applicable to a section of Side_B have limited the number of houses in that section by 50%. How many habitable homes are in Mariam's neighborhood?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total number of houses on Side_B using the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x, where x is the number of houses on Side_A. Given that there are 40 houses on Side_A, we substitute x with 40: f(40) = 40^2 + 3(40) f(40) = 1600 + 120 f(40) = 1720 So, there are 1720 houses on Side_B before considering uninhabitability and environmental constraints. Now, let's calculate the number of uninhabitable houses on Side_B, which is 10% of the total houses on Side_B: Uninhabitable houses on Side_B = 10% of 1720 Uninhabitable houses on Side_B = 0.10 * 1720 Uninhabitable houses on Side_B = 172 Subtracting the uninhabitable houses from the total gives us the number of potentially habitable houses on Side_B: Habitable houses on Side_B = 1720 - 172 Habitable houses on Side_B = 1548 Now, we need to account for the environmental constraints that limit the number of houses in a section of Side_B by 50%. Since the problem does not specify how many houses are affected by this constraint, we will assume that the constraint applies to the remaining habitable houses. Therefore, the number of houses affected by the environmental constraints is 50% of the habitable houses on Side_B: Affected houses on Side_B = 50% of 1548 Affected houses on Side_B = 0.50 * 1548 Affected houses on Side_B = 774 Since these houses are limited by 50%, they are still considered habitable, just reduced in number. So we do not subtract them from the total habitable houses. Finally, we add the number of houses on Side_A to the habitable houses on Side_B to get the total number of habitable homes in Mariam's neighborhood: Total habitable homes = Houses on Side_A + Habitable houses on Side_B Total habitable homes = 40 + 1548 Total habitable homes = 1588 Therefore, there are boxed{1588} habitable homes in Mariam's neighborhood."},{"prompt":"What is the largest fourdigit number whose digits add up to 20?","completion":"To find the largest digit combination for a four-digit number summing to 20: 1.

[ text{Average height} = frac{160 + 169 + 169}{3} = frac{498}{3} = 166 text{ cm} ] - Out of these, only one sailor (160 cm) is eligible (height ≤ 168 cm). - Therefore, at least half of the sailors in Team A may not be eligible due to having one eligible sailor out of three. 2. **Analyze Team B:** - The median height of sailors is 167 cm. - By definition, the median is the middle value when the heights are ordered. - This means at least half the sailors are 167 cm or shorter. - Consequently, at least half of the sailors can serve on the submarine as their heights do not exceed 168 cm. - If there are more sailors shorter than or equal to 167 cm, they are also eligible. 3. **Analyze Team C:** - The tallest sailor has a height of 169 cm. - Whether there are more sailors or their other heights are not mentioned explicitly within the acceptable range. - An example provided: Two sailors both with heights of 169 cm. - If all sailors have heights of 169 cm, none would be eligible. - Thus, this team does not give a clear indication that at least half can serve. 4. **Analyze Team D:** - The mode height of the sailors is 167 cm. - This means 167 cm is the most frequent height among the sailors. - Example: Five sailors with heights 167 cm, 167 cm, 169 cm, 170 cm, and 171 cm. - Out of these, only two sailors (167 cm) are eligible. - Hence, less than half might be eligible due to having three out of five exceeding the height limit. # Conclusion: By the height constraints for serving on the submarine (height ≤ 168 cm), Team B is identified as the only team where at least half of the sailors can serve since the median height ensures at least half of them do not exceed 167 cm.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to assign the volunteers without any restrictions. Since there are three areas and five volunteers, each volunteer can be assigned to any area, so there are 3^5 possible arrangements. However, we have overcounted, as we need to ensure that each area has at least one volunteer. So, we must subtract the cases where one or more areas have no volunteers. There are three areas and thus three ways to have an area with no volunteers. If we have an area with no volunteers, then there are 2^5 ways to assign the remaining five volunteers to the other two areas. So we subtract 3 cdot 2^5 from 3^5. But we have now subtracted too much, because in the cases where two areas have no volunteers (which is clearly impossible with a minimum of one volunteer per area and five volunteers in total, but mathematically we have subtracted these cases in the previous step), we have subtracted these cases three times (once for each area we chose to have no volunteers), so we need to add them back in once.

Since all individual terms ( f(i) ) sums bound under 2, even in nearest upper summation limit exceeds 2. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our original statement is true within derived bounds slightly higher for our second bound breaking.

A square is inscribed in such a way that two of its sides are parallel to one side of the pentagon, essentially dividing the pentagon into two geometric regions. 2. **Triangle Analysis:** When the square is inscribed, it forms two isosceles triangles within the pentagon.

We can verify this because the distances from ( M ) to ( A ) and ( B ) must be equal, making every point ( M ) on the perpendicular bisector equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ). 2. **General Case:** Assume ( k neq 1 ). Let's introduce a coordinate system on the plane such that point ( A ) has coordinates ( (-a, 0) ) and point ( B ) has coordinates ( (a, 0) ). 3. **General Setup:** Let point ( M ) have coordinates ( (x, y) ). 4. **Calculate Distances:** The distance ( AM ) can be expressed as: [ AM = sqrt{(x + a)^2 + y^2} ] The distance ( BM ) can be expressed as: [ BM = sqrt{(x - a)^2 + y^2} ] 5. **Set Up the Ratio:** [ frac{AM^2}{BM^2} = frac{(x + a)^2 + y^2}{(x - a)^2 + y^2} ] Given that: [ frac{AM^2}{BM^2} = k^2 ] 6. **Formulate the Equation:** [ frac{(x + a)^2 + y^2}{(x - a)^2 + y^2} = k^2 ] 7. **Simplify the Equation:** Multiply both sides by ((x - a)^2 + y^2): [ (x + a)^2 + y^2 = k^2 ((x - a)^2 + y^2) ] 8. **Expand and Collect Terms:** [ x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 = k^2 (x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2) ] 9. **Move All Terms to One Side:** [ x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - k^2 x^2 + 2k^2 ax - k^2 a^2 - k^2 y^2 = 0 ] 10. **Combine Like Terms:** [ (1 - k^2)x^2 + (2a + 2k^2 a)x + (1 - k^2) y^2 + (a^2 - k^2 a^2) = 0 ] 11. **Normalize the Equation:** Divide through by ( (1 - k^2) ), assuming ( k neq 1 ): [ x^2 + frac{2a + 2k^2 a}{1 - k^2}x + y^2 + frac{a^2 - k^2 a^2}{1 - k^2} = 0 ] This can be rewritten as: [ left(x + frac{1 + k^2}{1 - k^2} aright)^2 + y^2 = left( frac{2ka}{1 - k^2} right)^2 ] 12. **Conclusion:** The resulting equation is that of a circle.

This implies that the sequence is symmetric around n. Specifically, if x_i is an element of the sequence, then x_{n-i} = 2n - x_i must also be an element of the sequence. 2. **Analyzing Property (a)**: Property (a) states that x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_{n-1}. This is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. 3. **Using Property (b) to derive relationships**: From property (b), we have x_1 + x_{n-1} = 2n. Since x_1 is the smallest element and x_{n-1} is the largest, we can start by setting x_1 = a (where a is a positive integer), which implies x_{n-1} = 2n - a. 4. **Exploring Property (c)**: Property (c) states that for any x_i + x_j < 2n, there exists a k such that x_i + x_j = x_k. This property ensures that the sum of any two elements less than 2n must itself be an element of the sequence. 5. **Constructing the sequence**: We know x_1 = a and x_{n-1} = 2n - a. We also know from property (b) that x_2 + x_{n-2} = 2n, and so on. This symmetry and the fact that the sequence is strictly increasing suggest that each x_i can be expressed as a multiple of x_1. Let's assume x_i = i cdot a for i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1. 6. **Verifying the assumption**: If x_i = i cdot a, then x_{n-i} = (n-i) cdot a. From property (b), we have: [ x_i + x_{n-i} = i cdot a + (n-i) cdot a = n cdot a = 2n. ] This implies a = 2. Therefore, x_i = 2i. 7. **Checking Property (c)**: For any x_i + x_j < 2n, we have 2i + 2j < 2n, or i + j < n. The sum x_i + x_j = 2i + 2j = 2(i+j), which is indeed x_k for k = i+j, since i+j < n. 8. **Conclusion**: The sequence that satisfies all the given properties is x_i = 2i for i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1. This sequence is strictly increasing, symmetric as per property (b), and satisfies the condition in property (c) that the sum of any two elements less than 2n is also an element of the sequence.

If A, B, C have this property, does ( triangle ABC ) necessarily have perimeter ( p )? What happens if Γ is a circle?","completion":"To show that the normals to (Gamma) at points (A), (B), and (C) are the angle bisectors of (triangle ABC) when (ABC) has the maximum possible perimeter (p), we proceed as follows: 1. **Setup and Definitions:** - We consider the closed plane curve (Gamma), and (A), (B), (C) are points on (Gamma) such that the perimeter of (triangle ABC) is maximized. - Let (L) be the external bisector of the angle (angle ACB). This means (L) is perpendicular to the internal bisector of (angle ACB). 2. **Reflection and Inequality Argument:** - Reflect point (B) across the line (L) to get the point (B'). - Now, if (X) is any point on the opposite side of (L) from (triangle ABC), then it holds that (BX > B'X). - Summing distances, we get: [ AX + BX > AX + B'X ] - Notice that for points (A), (B'), and (X): [ AX + B'X geq AB' ] with equality if and only if (X) lies on the segment (AB'). - The length (AB') can be written as: [ AB' = AC + CB ] 3. **Perimeter Maximization:** - Therefore, combining the inequalities: [ AX + BX > AC + CB ] - This implies that the perimeter of (triangle AXB) is strictly greater than (p). Hence, (X) cannot be within the region enclosed by line (L). 4. **Line (L) and Tangent Implication:** - If the external bisector (L) does not coincide with the tangent to (Gamma) at point (C), it would intersect (Gamma) in further points. - Hence, the region enclosed by (Gamma) would contain points on both sides of (L), which contradicts our earlier implication of maximized perimeter. - Therefore, (L) must coincide with the tangent at (C). 5. **Norms being Tangents:** - By symmetry, the same logic applies at all three points (A), (B), and (C). Consequently, the normals at (A), (B), and (C) must be the angle bisectors of (triangle ABC). 6. **Necessity of Condition:** - However, showing that the normals being the angle bisectors does not necessarily imply a maximal perimeter: - Consider (Gamma) as an equilateral triangle with rounded corners (blunt vertices). - Choose the midpoints of the sides as the points (A), (B), and (C). - In this configuration, although the normals may align with angle bisectors, the perimeter is not maximal. 7. **Special Case of a Circle:** - If (Gamma) is a circle, maximum perimeter is achieved when (triangle ABC) is equilateral. - In a circle, the tangent at any point is perpendicular to the radius, and thus the angle bisectors (A), (B), and (C) being perpendicular to these radii also ensure they are the normals. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ text{ The normals to (Gamma) at (A), (B), (C) are the angle bisectors of (triangle ABC) when (triangle ABC) has the maximum perimeter.

Finally, we apply the function's monotonicity and its monotonic intervals to reach a conclusion. **Step-by-Step Solution** 1. Since f(x) is differentiable on mathbb{R} and f(x) = x^2 + 2xf'(2), we can differentiate both sides with respect to x: begin{align*} f'(x) &= frac{d}{dx} left(x^2 + 2xf'(2)right) &= 2x + 2f'(2) end{align*} 2.

For the next 30 minutes, the flow rate remains the same, so the total amount of water collected in the next 30 minutes is also ( 2 times frac{30}{x} ) cups. For the following hour (which is 60 minutes), the flow rate doubles to 4 cups per ( x ) minutes. So, the total number of ( x )-minute intervals in 60 minutes is ( frac{60}{x} ), and the total amount of water collected in the next hour is ( 4 times frac{60}{x} ) cups. The total amount of water collected is the sum of the water collected in all three time periods: [ 2 times frac{30}{x} + 2 times frac{30}{x} + 4 times frac{60}{x} ] Shawn then dumps half of the water away, and he is left with 18 cups.

First, we observe that Team A and Team B cannot both win their matches on Saturday, meaning they cannot both occupy the first and second places in the final ranking. This rule also applies to Team C and Team D for the third and fourth places. Therefore, the teams that can be in the first and second places are either (A or B) and (C or D), or vice versa. For the first and second places, we have two choices for which pair (either A and B or C and D) will be in these positions. Once we choose the pair, there are 2 ways to arrange them (either team from the pair can come first). This gives us 2 times 2 = 4 possibilities for each pair. Since there are two pairs (A and B, C and D), we multiply by 2 again for the choice of the pair, leading to 2 times 2 times 2 = 8 possibilities for the first and second places. For the third and fourth places, the arrangement depends on the losers of the Saturday matches. There are 2 ways to arrange two teams, so we have 2 possibilities for the third and fourth places.

We know that all four people have 145 fish together. So, if we add up the fish that Billy, Tony, and Sarah have, we can subtract that from the total to find out how many fish Bobby has.

Assume we are given a tetrahedron (A_1A_2A_3A_4) where the three edges meeting at vertex (A_1) are mutually perpendicular to each other. - Here, (A_1) acts as the orthocenter of the tetrahedron. 2. Focus on face (A_2A_3A_4), which must be an acute triangle. - The point (A_1) projects orthogonally onto this face to form the altitude's base point, which is also the orthocenter of (triangle A_2A_3A_4). 3.

Let’s assume (A_{1}H_{1}) is the altitude and (H_{1}) is the orthocenter of (triangle A_{2}A_{3}A_{4}) which is an acute triangle.

If one of its angles is acute, the orthopoint (H) will lie inside it, thus making (t^2) of the opposing faces be larger. 7. Using face area inequalities for the tetrahedron's orthocenter theorem that: [ t_{A_{1}A_{3}A_{4}}^2 > t_{A_{2}A_{3}A_{4}} cdot t_{A_{3}A_{4}H_1} ] This results in understanding triangle areas by geometric medians. **c) One face is larger making one angle obtuse** 8.

Therefore, if vertices (A_i) are acutely angled, height drops orthogonally, leading to exterior orthocenters ensuring conditions hold. Ultimately, vertices as required properties get disproven if the relation changes to allow obtuse angles to surface yielding higher face area squares respectively greater properties per projection principles. # Conclusion: Thus, if each face's area squared is less than the sum of squares of the other faces, all the angles in the tetrahedron are acute, and the orthocenter lies within the tetrahedron. Conversely, if one face's area squared is greater, the opposite angle is obtuse, and the orthocenter lies outside the tetrahedron.

Substituting cos alpha = -frac{2}{3} into this identity gives: [ sin^2 alpha = 1 - left(-frac{2}{3}right)^2 = 1 - frac{4}{9} = frac{5}{9} ] Taking the square root of both sides, and considering that sin alpha > 0, we find: [ sin alpha = sqrt{frac{5}{9}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{3} ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ), with ( Lambda B = AC > BC ), point ( D ) inside ( triangle ABC ) satisfies ( DA = DB + DC ).

Each sector is either painted black or white. Both circles have the same number of black and white sectors. The goal is to show that by rotating one circle, we can ensure that at least half the length of the circumference will have sectors of different colors aligned. 2. **Notation and Definitions:** - Denote the sectors of the inner circle as P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2k}. - Denote the sectors of the outer circle as Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_{2k}. - Let W_i and B_i be the number of white and black sectors respectively in the inner circle, and similarly for the outer circle: W_o and B_o. - Due to the problem condition, we have W_i = W_o and B_i = B_o. 3. **Assign Numerical Values:** Let's assign a numerical value to the colors for convenience: - White = 1 - Black = -1 4. **Initial Alignment and Summation:** Consider the initial alignment of the two circles (without rotation).

Expand each term on the left-hand side using the Binomial theorem: [ begin{aligned} (i+1)^{k+1} &= i^{k+1} + binom{k+1}{1} i^k + binom{k+1}{2} i^{k-1} + cdots + binom{k+1}{k} i + 1 quad text{for}quad i = 0, 1, ldots, n end{aligned} ] 7. Sum these equations from i = 0 to i = n: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} (i+1)^{k+1} = sum_{i=0}^{n} i^{k+1} + sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{k+1}{1} i^k + sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{k+1}{2} i^{k-1} + cdots + sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{k+1}{k} i + sum_{i=0}^{n} 1 ] 8. Notice that the first sum on the right-hand side is: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} i^{k+1} = S_{k+1} ] where S_{t} = sum_{i=1}^n i^t. 9. Replace sum_{i=0}^n i^{k+1} in the preceding equation and rearrange: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} (i+1)^{k+1} = S_{k+1} + binom{k+1}{1} S_k + binom{k+1}{2} S_{k-1} + cdots + binom{k+1}{k} S_1 + n + 1 ] 10. Noting that sum_{i=0}^{n} (i+1)^{k+1} = (n+1)^{k+1} and simplifying, we get: [ (n+1)^{k+1} = S_{k+1} + binom{k+1}{1} S_k + binom{k+1}{2} S_{k-1} + cdots + binom{k+1}{1} S_1 + (n + 1) ] 11. Solve for S_{k+1}: [ S_{k+1} = (n+1)^{k+1} - left( (n+1) + binom{k+1}{1} S_k + binom{k+1}{2} S_{k-1} + cdots + binom[k+1]{k} S_1 right) ] 12. The above equation bears out our hypothesis and completes the induction. Thus, we have shown that the sum S_{k} of the first n kth powers can be expressed as S_{k}(n) a polynomial in n of degree k+1. 13. Now let's consider the problem for k=10 for organizing 1^{10}, 2^{10}, ldots, n^{10} such that they can be divided into 10 groups with equal sum. Recall that [ S_{10}(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{10} ] Since this S_{10}(n) is a polynomial in n of degree 11 according to our inductive result. 14. Choose segments of the interval [0, 1], such that they can be colored with 10 colors. According to the coloring property, every segment of this partition structure satisfies the desired polynomial sum equality by matching their intervals and corresponding frequencies. 15. Scale this color mapping onto the integers from 1 to n and accordingly these mapped sums cooperate to show that there exists n natural number to partition 1^{10}, 2^{10}, ldots, n^{10} into 10 groups of equal sums.

We will provide a detailed explanation using different approaches to prove this inequality. **Approach 1: Completing the Square** 1. Starting with the given equation: [ a + b + c = 2sqrt{abc} ] 2. We rearrange it to isolate the square root on one side: [ a + b + c - 2sqrt{abc} = 0 ] 3. To complete the square, add and subtract ( bc ) inside the expression: [ a - 2sqrt{abc} + bc + b + c = bc + (sqrt{a} - sqrt{bc})^2 + b + c ] 4. Hence, we can write: [ a - 2sqrt{abc} + bc + b + c = (sqrt{a} - sqrt{bc})^2 + b + c - bc ] 5. Finally, it follows that: [ bc = b + c + (sqrt{a} - sqrt{bc})^2 geq b + c ] Thus, we have shown ( bc geq b + c ). **Approach 2: Quadratic Equation in ( sqrt{a} )** 1. Consider the given equation and view it as a quadratic equation in ( sqrt{a} ): [ (sqrt{a})^2 - 2sqrt{bc}sqrt{a} + b + c = 0 ] 2. The discriminant of this quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) must be non-negative for real values: [ D = (2sqrt{bc})^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (b + c) ] 3. Simplify the discriminant: [ D = 4bc - 4(b + c) ] 4. For the equation to have real solutions: [ 4bc - 4(b + c) geq 0 ] 5. Dividing both sides by 4: [ bc geq b + c ] This confirms ( bc geq b + c ). **Approach 3: Boundaries and Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality** 1. If ( a = 0 ), then from the given equation: [ b + c = 0 ] 2. This implies ( b = 0 ) and ( c = 0 ): [ bc = 0, quad b + c = 0 quad Rightarrow quad bc geq b + c ] 3. For ( a > 0 ), apply the AM-GM inequality: [ a + b + c geq 2sqrt{a(b + c)} ] 4. Using the given condition: [ 2sqrt{abc} geq 2sqrt{a(b + c)} ] 5. Divide both sides by ( 2sqrt{a} ): [ sqrt{bc} geq sqrt{b + c} ] 6. Squaring both sides: [ bc geq b + c ] Thus, again we confirm ( bc geq b + c ). **Approach 4: Using AM-GM Inequality Directly** 1. By the AM-GM inequality: [ a + bc geq 2sqrt{abc} ] 2. Given the condition: [ 2sqrt{abc} = a + b + c ] 3. Therefore, substitute: [ a + bc geq a + b + c ] 4.

Here's the detailed breakdown: 1. **Assumptions**: Let's assume that the circumference (total length) of the circle is n. The first player will place their markers on the vertices of an inscribed regular n-gon. 2. **Second Player's Strategy**: The strategy for the second player is to place their markers on the remaining vertices of this n-gon as long as this is possible. 3. **Arc Classification**: Define the arcs connecting adjacent vertices of the n-gon as basic arcs. A basic arc that contains no other marked points will be called clean. If a clean arc has red ends, it is called dangerous. 4. **Game Analysis**: - As the game reaches the point where all vertices of the n-gon are marked, suppose the first player has marked k vertices. - Subsequently, the second player marks n - k vertices, meaning they still have k turns remaining. 5. **Dangerous Arcs Count**: There can be at most k-1 dangerous arcs when k vertices are marked by the first player. Hence, in k-1 moves, the second player can neutralize (make them safe) these dangerous arcs. 6. **Final Moves**: As the game continues, with each move, the second player ensures dangerous arcs are either diminished or converted until the moment before their last move: - At this point, all the arcs with red ends will be smaller than a unit length. - The largest length l of such an arc satisfies l < 1. 7. **Remaining Clean Arc**: Initially, there were n clean arcs. With n-1 moves excluding endpoints, it implies one clean arc remains. This remaining clean arc has a blue end and can be controlled by the second player for the final move. 8. **Final Winning Move**: The second player marks a point on this remaining clean arc at a distance more than l from the blue end, guaranteeing it is longer than any of the arcs that were formed by the first player's red markers. # Conclusion: Thus, by strategically placing their markers, the second player ensures they control the longest arc at the end, thereby always winning irrespective of the moves made by the first player.

According to the problem, the midline (median) of the trapezoid is 6.5 units. The midline in a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the two bases. 4. We can transform the trapezoid into a right triangle by making a parallel translation. 5.

From the problem constraints, the diagonals intersect perpendicularly, forming right angles at the intersecting point. By the right-angle property and Pythagoras' theorem, the relationship between the diagonals d_1 and d_2 can be formulated. 7.

Thus, we only need to find n such that either of these becomes 0. 2. **Equality Condition**: |a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}| = 0 when a_{n-2} = a_{n-3}. We first investigate when |y - x| = 0 or |z - y| = 0. However, since all are odd and distinct, this cannot occur because |odd - odd| geq 2. 3. **Consecutive Equality Condition**: If at any position, a_n = a_{n-1}, then a_{n+2} = 0, because a_{n+1} = a_n cdot |a_n - a_{n-1}| = a_n cdot 0 = 0. The first possibility of a_n = 0 therefore arises when a_4 = z cdot |y - x|, and so the only way this can result in a_5 = 0 is when |y - x| = 2 as all values are odd.

How many noncongruent triangles can be drawn?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the number of non-congruent triangles that can be formed by connecting 3 out of 15 equally spaced points on a circle. Two triangles are congruent if they can be made to coincide by rotation or reflection. 2. **Counting Non-Congruent Triangles**: To count the non-congruent triangles, we need to consider the arc lengths subtended by the sides of the triangles. Since the points are equally spaced, the arc lengths can be represented by the number of points between the vertices of the triangle. 3. **Partitioning the Circle**: We can think of the problem as partitioning the circle into three arcs. The sum of the arc lengths must be 15 (the total number of points). Let the lengths of the arcs be (a), (b), and (c) such that (a + b + c = 15). Each arc length must be at least 1 (since each side of the triangle must connect distinct points). 4. **Counting Partitions**: We need to count the number of ways to partition 15 into three parts, where each part is at least 1. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation (a + b + c = 15) with (a, b, c geq 1). 5. **Transforming the Problem**: We can transform the problem by letting (a' = a - 1), (b' = b - 1), and (c' = c - 1). Then (a', b', c' geq 0) and (a' + b' + c' = 12). This is a classic problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation (a' + b' + c' = 12). 6. **Using Stars and Bars Theorem**: The number of non-negative integer solutions to (a' + b' + c' = 12) is given by the binomial coefficient (binom{12 + 2}{2} = binom{14}{2}). 7. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient**: [ binom{14}{2} = frac{14 times 13}{2 times 1} = 91 ] 8. **Removing Congruent Triangles**: Since the points are on a circle, rotations and reflections can make some triangles congruent. We need to count only the distinct sets of arc lengths. The number of distinct sets of arc lengths (or partitions) of 15 into three parts is given by the number of partitions of 12 into at most 3 parts. 9. **Counting Partitions of 12 into at Most 3 Parts**: The partitions of 12 into at most 3 parts are: [ (12, 0, 0), (11, 1, 0), (10, 2, 0), (9, 3, 0), (8, 4, 0), (7, 5, 0), (6, 6, 0), (6, 5, 1), (5, 4, 3), (4, 4, 4) ] There are 19 such partitions. 10. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of non-congruent triangles that can be formed is 19.

Hence: [ x + yi = k(xmathrm{i} + (1 - y)) ] 5. **Working with ( k ):** Divide both sides by ( k ): [ frac{x + yi}{k} = xmathrm{i} + (1 - y) ] This gives: [ x + yi = kx mathrm{i} + k(1 - y) ] By equating real and imaginary parts: [ x = k(1 - y) ] [ y = kx ] 6. **Solve the System of Equations:** From ( x = k(1-y) ), solve for ( k ): [ k = frac{x}{1-y} ] From ( y = kx ), substitute for ( k ): [ y = frac{x}{1-y} x ] [ y = frac{x^2}{1 - y} ] Cross-multiplying: [ y(1 - y) = x^2 ] [ y - y^2 = x^2 ] Replace ( y = x ), the curve in the complex plane, which is obviously a circle or a part of it. 7. **Conclusion and Circumference:** Knowing that it fits a circle, the simplest non-trivial ( z ) that fits the whole equation results in: [ z = 1 + i ] So, the equation simplifies further and there is meaning to circumferences of unit one thus generalizing it into the semicircle circumference conclusion.

Then the number of red odd-numbered points and blue even-numbered points is y = 1011 - x, and the number of blue odd-numbered points is x. 5. Segment lengths with even distances do not affect the parity of S, and the number of such segments of odd length is equal to x^2 + y^2. 6. Notice that the numbers x and y are of different parities. This implies that x^2 + y^2 is odd (since an odd number squared is odd, and an even number squared is even, and the sum of an odd and even number is odd). 7.

Let k be the coordinate of the red endpoint of a segment and c be the coordinate of the blue endpoint of the segment. 2. Instead of considering the length |k-c| of this segment, replace it by k+c.

We know that Carl went home with 18 watermelons, so ( S = W - 18 ). The total amount of money Carl made is 105, and this is the sum of the prices of all the watermelons he sold, each with a different discount rate. Since the base price of each watermelon is 3, without any discounts, the total revenue from selling ( S ) watermelons would be ( 3S ). However, because each watermelon was sold with a different discount rate, we need to account for the discounts. Let's assume that the discounts were applied in such a way that they were evenly distributed between 0% and 50%. This means that on average, the discount rate for each watermelon would be 25% (the midpoint of the range from 0% to 50%). Therefore, on average, each watermelon was sold for 75% of its base price. The average price for each watermelon after the discount is ( 3 times 0.75 = 2.25 ). So the total revenue from selling ( S ) watermelons at an average price of 2.25 is ( 2.25S ). We know that the total revenue is 105, so we can set up the equation: [ 2.25S = 105 ] Now we can solve for ( S ): [ S = frac{105}{2.25} ] [ S = 46.67 ] Since Carl can't sell a fraction of a watermelon, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 46 watermelons sold.

Since each number (a_1) and (a_2) must not exceed their indices, the only possible values for (a_1) and (a_2) are: - (a_1 = 1) - (a_2 = 1) (because they cannot exceed 1 and 2 respectively, and their sum must be even). - The only possible case is (a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_2 = 1 ). - The sums we get are: - ( a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 ) - ( a_1 - a_2 = 1 - 1 = 0 ) - Hence, one of the sums is (0), proving the base case. 2. **Induction Step:** - Assume that the statement holds for ( n = k ), i.e., for any natural numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) such that ( a_i leq i ) and the sum is even, one of the sums ( a_1 pm a_2 pm ldots pm a_k ) is equal to zero. - We need to show it holds for ( n = k+1 ). Consider ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_{k+1} ), where ( a_{k+1} leq k+1 ) and the total sum is still even. 3. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: (a_k = a_{k+1}):** - In this case, the sum (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k + a_{k+1}) is even, and since ( a_k = a_{k+1} ), the sum ( a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k ) must also be even. - By the induction hypothesis, one of the sums ( a_1 pm a_2 pm ldots pm a_{k} ) equals zero. - Therefore, substituting ( a_{k} - a_{k+1} ) maintains the parity and ensures (a_1 pm a_2 pm ldots pm a_k pm a_{k+1} ) can also be zero. - **Case 2: ( a_k neq a_{k+1} ):** - Consider the set (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k-1}, |a_k - a_{k+1}|). The element ( |a_k - a_{k+1}| ) is a non-negative integer and satisfies: 1. ( |a_k - a_{k+1}| leq k ) (since both ( a_k leq k) and ( a_{k+1} leq k+1 )). 2. The number ( |a_k - a_{k+1}| ) has the same parity as the original ( a_k + a_{k+1} ). - Since the induction hypothesis holds for ( k ), one of the sums ( a_1 pm a_2 pm ldots pm |a_k - a_{k+1}| ) must be zero. - By rewriting ( |a_k - a_{k+1}| = pm (a_k - a_{k+1}) ), we see that the original term fits into the form ( a_1 pm a_2 pm ldots pm a_{k} pm a_{k+1} ), ensuring the induction step holds. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{One of the sums } a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n} text{ is equal to } 0.} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest positive integer n such that 5n equiv 2024 pmod{26}?","completion":"First, we simplify 2024 pmod{26}: 2024 div 26 = 77text{ remainder }22 Thus, 2024 equiv 22 pmod{26}.

S = 28 + 70 + 88 + 104 S = 290 Now, since the mean of these five numbers is 67, we can set up the equation: (290 + x) / 5 = 67 Multiplying both sides by 5 gives us: 290 + x = 335 Subtracting 290 from both sides gives us the value of x: x = 335 - 290 x = 45 Now we know that x is 45. Next, let's find the value of y using the median of the second set of numbers. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are six numbers, the median will be the average of the third and fourth numbers when they are arranged in order. We know that the median is 81, and we know that x is 45. Let's arrange the numbers in order, including x: y, 45, 50, 62, 97, 124 Since the median is 81, the average of the third and fourth numbers must be 81. The third and fourth numbers are 62 and 97. (62 + 97) / 2 = 81 159 / 2 = 81 Since 159 / 2 is actually 79.5, not 81, we need to adjust our understanding of the median. The median is not the average of 62 and 97, but rather the average of x and the number immediately after it in the ordered list. Since x is 45, we need to find y such that the average of 45 and y is 81. (45 + y) / 2 = 81 Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us: 45 + y = 162 Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us the value of y: y = 162 - 45 y = 117 Now we know that y is 117. Finally, let's find the mean of the numbers 50, 62, 97, 124, x (which is 45), and y (which is 117). The sum of these numbers is: 50 + 62 + 97 + 124 + 45 + 117 = 495 The mean is the sum divided by the number of numbers, which is 6: 495 / 6 = 82.5 Therefore, the mean of the numbers 50, 62, 97, 124, x, and y is boxed{82.5} ."},{"prompt":"Expand the product (x+3)(x+9).","completion":"To expand the product (x+3)(x+9), use the distributive property: [ (x+3)(x+9) = (x+3) cdot x + (x+3) cdot 9. ] Apply the distributive property again to both terms: [ (x+3) cdot x = x^2 + 3x, quad (x+3) cdot 9 = 9x + 27. ] Combine like terms: [ x^2 + 3x + 9x + 27 = x^2 + 12x + 27. ] Thus, the expanded form of (x+3)(x+9) is: [ boxed{x^2 + 12x + 27}. ]"},{"prompt":"Ethyl bought Lucy some new dolls for her doll collection.

Let's denote the original number of dolls in Lucy's collection as x. The addition of the new dolls, which is 25% of x, can be represented as 0.25x. After the addition of the new dolls, Lucy has 10 dolls in total. This can be represented by the equation: x + 0.25x = 10 Combining like terms, we get: 1.25x = 10 To find the original number of dolls (x), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.25: x = 10 / 1.25 x = 8 So, Lucy originally had 8 dolls. Since the collection increased to 10 dolls after Ethyl bought some new ones, we can find the number of dolls Ethyl bought by subtracting the original number of dolls from the total number of dolls: Number of new dolls = Total number of dolls - Original number of dolls Number of new dolls = 10 - 8 Number of new dolls = 2 Ethyl bought Lucy boxed{2} new dolls."},{"prompt":"Given overrightarrow {a} = (1, 1), overrightarrow {b} = (1, 1), then the vector 3overrightarrow {a} 2overrightarrow {b} equals to ( ) A: (1, 5) B: (5, 1) C: (5, 5) D: (1, 1)","completion":"Given overrightarrow {a} = (1, 1), overrightarrow {b} = (1, -1), then the vector 3overrightarrow {a} - 2overrightarrow {b} equals 3(1, 1) - 2(1, -1) = (1, 5).

For set B: 3, 6, 10 We check the conditions: - 3 + 6 = 9 < 10 Since 9 < 10, set B cannot form a triangle because the sum of two sides is not greater than the third side. For set C: 5, 5, 11 We check the conditions: - 5 + 5 = 10 < 11 Since 10 < 11, set C cannot form a triangle for the same reason as set B. For set D: 5, 6, 11 We check the conditions: - 5 + 6 = 11 = 11 Although 5 + 6 = 11, for a set of line segments to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side. Therefore, set D cannot form a triangle. Based on the triangle inequality theorem, the only set that can form a triangle is set A.

For the sugar, she has already added 1/4 cup, but the recipe calls for 2/3 cup. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 2/3 cup (required) - 1/4 cup (already added) = 2/3 cup - 1/4 cup To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Given that the difference between his highest and lowest score is 150 runs, we can write the following equation: H - L = 150 (1) The total runs scored by the batsman in 46 innings is his average multiplied by the number of innings: Total runs = Average * Innings Total runs = 62 * 46 Total runs = 2852 Now, if we exclude the highest and lowest scores, we have the total runs scored in the remaining 44 innings, which is the new average multiplied by the number of remaining innings: Total runs excluding H and L = New average * Remaining innings Total runs excluding H and L = 58 * 44 Total runs excluding H and L = 2552 The sum of the highest and lowest scores can be found by subtracting the total runs excluding H and L from the total runs: H + L = Total runs - Total runs excluding H and L H + L = 2852 - 2552 H + L = 300 (2) Now we have two equations: H - L = 150 (1) H + L = 300 (2) We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of H and L.

This can be reformulated as finding ( k in mathbb{N} ) such that: [ a_1 a_2 ldots a_n = k(k+1) + 1 = k^2 + k + 1 ] 2. **Observation About ( k^2 + k + 1 ):** We need to show that for some ( k in mathbb{N} ), ( k^2 + k + 1 ) has at least ( n ) distinct prime divisors. If ( k^2 + k + 1 ) can be written as ( p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} ldots p_m^{b_m} ) with distinct primes ( p_i ) and exponents ( b_i ) (where ( m geq n )), we can set ( a_i = p_i^{b_i} ) for ( i leq n-1 ) and ( a_n = p_n^{b_n} ldots p_m^{b_m} ). 3. **Show Infinite Number of Primes Dividing ( k^2 + k + 1 ):** Suppose the set of primes dividing ( k^2 + k + 1 ) for ( k in mathbb{N} ) is finite, denoted as ( {p_1, p_2, ldots, p_i} ). For ( k = p_1 p_2 ldots p_i ), we have: [ k^2 + k + 1 > 1 ] This implies there exists a prime ( p_j ) dividing ( k^2 + k + 1 ). Since ( p_j ) divides ( k ), ( p_j ) must divide: [ k^2 + k + 1 - (k^2 + k) = 1 ] This is a contradiction, proving that the set of primes dividing ( k^2 + k + 1 ) is infinite. 4. **Ensure ( k^2 + k + 1 ) Has at Least ( n ) Prime Divisors:** For any distinct primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n ), choose ( k ) such that ( p_i ) divides ( k^2 + k + 1 ) for each ( i ). Consider the system of congruences: [ x equiv k_1 pmod{p_1}, quad x equiv k_2 pmod{p_2}, quad ldots, quad x equiv k_n pmod{p_n} ] Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find ( x ) such that ( x mod p_i = k_i mod p_i ) for all ( i ). This ( x ) exists because ( {p_i} ) are pairwise coprime. Moreover, we can choose ( x ) to be positive by adjusting with multiples of ( p_1 p_2 ldots p_n ). 5. **Conclusion:** Given ( x equiv k_i pmod{p_i} ), each ( p_i ) divides ( x^2 + x + 1 ) by our selection of ( k_i ). Thus, we have proven that there exists ( x in mathbb{N} ) such that ( x^2 + x + 1 ) has at least ( n ) distinct prime divisors. Hence, such integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) exist.

Specifically: - Point (A_0) is the intersection of lines (A_1 B_2) and (A_2 C_1). - Point (B_0) is the intersection of lines (B_1 C_2) and (B_2 A_1). - Point (C_0) is the intersection of lines (C_1 A_2) and (C_2 B_1). 2. **Apply Menelaus' Theorem to the formed triangles:** For the line (ABC) to be a transversal line (Menelaus' condition) for (triangle A_0 B_0 C_0), it must intersect the sides (or extensions) of the triangle at points ((B_2, C_1), (C_2, A_1), (A_2, B_1)).

We know that A B_{0} and A C_{0} are the midpoints of AC and AB, respectively. Thus, we can write: [ AB_{0} = frac{c}{2}, quad AC_{0} = frac{b}{2} ] 3. Since O B_{0} and O C_{0} are the perpendicular bisectors of AC and AB, respectively, the segments B^{prime} B_{0} and C^{prime} C_{0} are equal to the heights of rhombus OPHQ, implying: [ B^{prime} B_{0} = C^{prime} C_{0} ] 4. Thus, we have the equation: [ left| A C_{0} - A C^{prime} right| = left| A B_{0} - A B^{prime} right| ] 5. Substituting in the lengths known, we obtain: [ left| frac{b}{2} - c cos alpha right| = left| frac{c}{2} - b cos alpha right| ] 6. Considering the situation where the absolute values are expanded with the same sign: [ frac{b}{2} - c cos alpha = frac{c}{2} - b cos alpha ] 7. This simplifies to: [ b left( frac{1}{2} + cos alpha right) = c left( frac{1}{2} + cos alpha right) ] 8. Given that alpha < 90^circ, we know cos alpha > 0 and hence: [ b = c ] This contradicts the assumption that the triangle is scalene. 9. Now assume the absolute values expand with different signs. Consider frac{b}{2} - c cos alpha > 0 and frac{c}{2} - b cos alpha < 0. This geometrically means that point B^{prime} is between A and B_{0}, and point C_{0} is between A and C^{prime}. 10. Hence, we have: [ frac{b}{2} - c cos alpha = b cos alpha - frac{c}{2} ] 11. Solving this, we get: [ frac{b + c}{2} = (b + c) cos alpha ] 12. From this we find: [ cos alpha = frac{1}{2} ] 13. Therefore, alpha = 60^circ. 14. Thus, [ AC^{prime} = b cos alpha = frac{b}{2} = AB_{0} ] 15. This implies that points B_{0} and C^{prime} are symmetric relative to the angle bisector of angle BAC. Hence, the straight lines O B_{0} and CC^{prime} are also symmetric, making their intersection point Q lie on the angle bisector of angle BAC. 16.

Afterwards, one small square was cut out from this net, resulting in a net of size 3 times 3 with one missing square. 2. **Determine the Initial Dimensions:** Since the parallelepiped had dimensions 2 times 1, its net must cover all its faces. By expanding along the edges, we get the net of a rectangular prism with dimensions such that each face corresponds to a part of a 3 times 3 grid of unit squares, but initially accounting for overlapping. 3. **Calculation of Total Facets:** The parallelepiped has 3 pairs of faces. Specifically: - Two faces of size 2 times 1, - Two faces of size 1 times 1, - Two faces of size 1 times 1. 4. **Forming the Net:** Combining these faces into a flat net, a 3x3 grid emerges from the typical unfold of a rectangular solid.

When we take each of these sums modulo 100, we get remainders (r_i = s_i mod 100) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 100). 5. There are 100 possible remainders: (0, 1, 2, ldots, 99).

She drives for 2 hours at 60mph, takes a bathroom break, and then continues driving for 3 hours at 50 mph. She can drive for 30 miles on one gallon of gas. If one gallon of gas costs 2, how much money does she spend on gas for her trip?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total distance Jenna drives. For the first part of the trip, she drives for 2 hours at 60 mph: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles For the second part of the trip, she drives for 3 hours at 50 mph: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 50 mph × 3 hours = 150 miles Now, let's add the distances together to get the total distance: Total distance = 120 miles + 150 miles = 270 miles Next, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas she uses for the entire trip. Jenna's car can drive 30 miles on one gallon of gas, so we divide the total distance by the miles per gallon to find out how many gallons she needs: Gallons of gas needed = Total distance / Miles per gallon Gallons of gas needed = 270 miles / 30 miles per gallon = 9 gallons Finally, we calculate the total cost of the gas for the trip. The cost of one gallon of gas is 2, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: Total cost of gas = Gallons of gas needed × Cost per gallon Total cost of gas = 9 gallons × 2 per gallon = 18 Jenna spends boxed{18} on gas for her trip."},{"prompt":"The 25^text{th} day of a particular month is a Monday.

We can set up the equation as follows: 5 * 1.6 - (2 * 1.4) / x = 4 First, we calculate the multiplication: 8 - (2.8) / x = 4 Now, we want to isolate x, so we'll move everything else to the other side of the equation: (2.8) / x = 8 - 4 (2.8) / x = 4 Now, we multiply both sides by x to get rid of the division: 2.8 = 4x Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for x: x = 2.8 / 4 x = 0.7 So the number is boxed{0.7} ."},{"prompt":"w many paths are there from A to B in a grid of 7 steps to the right and 6 steps up, if every step must be up or to the right, with the restriction that no more than 3 consecutive steps in either direction can be made?","completion":"1. **Total Steps**: There would be a total of 7 + 6 = 13 steps. 2. **Paths Count Without Restriction**: Normally, the number of ways to choose 6 \\"up\\" steps from a total of 13 steps would be calculated as binom{13}{6}. 3. **Applying Constraints**: The constraint of no more than 3 consecutive steps in either direction complicates the direct computation. We would need to use a combinatorial counting method (such as recursion or generating functions) to ensure this condition is met. However, to simplify here, we might first calculate without the restriction and then subtract paths that violate the condition. 4. **Binomial Calculation**: binom{13}{6} = 1716 represents paths without considering consecutive steps limits. Conclusion and Verification of Validity: In reality, subtracting out configurations that violate the \\"no more than 3 consecutive steps\\" condition requires detailed counting or generating functions, which is not covered in this elementary explanation.

Converting this to polar coordinates, we have rho^2-2rho(costheta+sintheta)-1=0. (II) Using the substitutions x=rhocostheta and y=rhosintheta, the rectangular coordinate equation of circle C becomes x^2+y^2-2x-2y-1=0. Substituting the parametric equations of line l into this equation, we get: (2+tcosalpha)^2+(2+tsinalpha)^2-2(2+tcosalpha)-2(2+tsinalpha)-1=0 Simplifying this expression, we obtain: t^2+(2cosalpha+2sinalpha)t-1=0 Let t_1 and t_2 be the roots of this equation. Then, we have t_1+t_2=-2cosalpha-2sinalpha and t_1 t_2=-1.
