C. Celsus）编纂的百科全书中目前仅存的医学卷《医学》（De Medicna）和瓦罗(M.T. Varro)编纂的包含九大自由学科术语的《学科九卷》（Nine Books of Disciplines）；底奥斯可里底斯(P. Dioscorides)编纂的《药剂学》（De materia medica）和老普林尼(Pliny The Elder)的《博物志》（Naturalis Historia，又译《自然史》）则包含关植物和药理的内容。 继“医学之父”希波克拉底之后，西方古代医学史上的另一座丰碑是2世纪古罗马的盖仑(C. Galenus)，他所创立的医学知识和生物学知识体系在整个中世纪一直被欧洲国家奉为信条。他以希腊语撰写了大量医学书籍。需要特别指出的是，在医学术语编纂实践发展的基础上，对术语的释义也有了更为明确的要求。盖仑是提出术语释义方法的第一人，他指出每个特定单词/术语的解释及其应用都应该是明确的。这表明，从2世纪起，术语编纂已经开始具有了初步的理论思考。 拜占庭文化是对古希腊和罗马文化的继承。拜占庭帝国医学知识源自于希波克拉底文集和盖仑的作品。拜占庭的医学家，很多都是医学百科全书的编纂者，他们收集了古希腊罗马丰富的医学知识遗产，融合了拜占庭医生的经验并加以系统化，编纂了数量众多的百科全书，为后世留下了大量珍贵的医学资料，其中最著名的是由奥里巴修斯（Oribasius）编写的《医学概要》（Collecta medicinalis），该书共有72卷，其中只有27卷幸存下来。奥里巴修斯还将这部百科全书缩编为9卷，名为《简编》（Synopsis），供医学生使用。4—7世纪，是拜占庭医学百科全书编纂最为繁荣的时期。 由于不同文明之间的融合，医学知识得以相互渗透、相互丰富。9世纪之后，包括希波克拉底、盖仑作品在内的大量医学文献通过拜占庭传入阿拉伯和欧洲医学，而许多在欧洲已失传的古代典籍则从阿拉伯语版本被再次翻译成拉丁语版本而传入欧洲[6]。东欧与俄罗斯受拜占庭文化的影响最大，9世纪拜占庭文化在斯拉夫人居住地的传播取得了最大的成功，此后，大量的希腊语书籍被翻译成斯拉夫语，为俄罗斯医学术语编纂的萌芽奠定了基础。переведите на русский","completion":"II. Ранние основы для разработки русской медицинской терминологии Формирование и развитие культуры любой нации не являются изолированными; они являются результатом взаимного слияния и заимствования культур других народов. Развитие российской медицины прошло аналогичный путь, будучи постоянно под влиянием других народов, она усваивала суть медицины других национальностей и питалась ею, постоянно обогащаясь и наполняясь, и, вместе с развитием медицины, происходило и развитие терминологии, которая также прошла путь от заимствования и усвоения до формирования собственных национальных особенностей. С точки зрения исторического происхождения почва для прорастания терминологии в России была подготовлена богатым наследием древнегреческой и римской культур, а также культуры Византии. Истоки западной древней медицинской терминологии можно отследить еще на четыре тысячи лет назад, культурам древней Вавилонии-Ассирии и Египта. За 2500 год до нашей эры в Месопотамии появились первые библиотеки в мире, в которых были таблички с записями медицинских идей. Однако рациональная медицина как таковая возникла в 5 веке до нашей эры, когда древнегреческая медицина постепенно формировалась и вступала в свой золотой век. Труды Гиппократа и Аристотеля, а также большое количество медицинских документов, хранящихся в Александрийской академии, заложили основу для зарождения древней медицинской терминологии. В этот период многие энциклопедии включали медицинские разделы, например, сохранившиеся медицинские тома энциклопедий Цельса (A. C. Celsius) \\"О медицине\\" (De Medicina) и Варрона (M.T. Varro) \\"Девять книг об учениях\\" (Nine Books of Disciplines); \\"Материа медика\\" (De materia medica) Диоскорида и \\"Естественная история\\" (Naturalis Historia) Плиния Старшего, содержащие информацию о растениях и фармакологии. После \\"отца медицины\\" греческого врача Гиппократа, другим маяком в истории древней западной медицины был древнеримский ученый 2 века Клавдий Гален (C. Galenus), который создал медицинскую и биологическую систему знаний, которая на протяжении всего Средневековья считалась научным каноном в европейских странах. Он написал множество медицинских книг на греческом языке. Особенно важно отметить, что на основе развития практики составления терминологии появились более четкие требования к определению терминов. Гален был первым, кто предложил методику терминологических определений, указав, что толкование каждого конкретного слова/термина и его применение должны быть ясными. Это говорит о том, что с 2 века разработка терминологии начала приобретать элементы теоретических рассуждений. Культура Византии представляет собой наследие древнегреческой и римской культур. Медицинские знания Византийской империи происходили из трудов Гиппократа и Галена. Многие византийские медики были составителями медицинских энциклопедий, которые собирали богатое наследие древнегреческой и римской медицины, сочетали его с опытом византийских врачей и систематизировали это знание, создав многочисленные энциклопедии, оставившие после себя богатое медицинское наследие. Самым известным произведением считается \\"Медицинский сборник\\" (\\"Collecta medicinalis\\"), написанный Орибазием, состоящий из 72 томов, из которых до нашего времени дошло только 27. Орибазий также составил краткую версию этой энциклопедии в 9 томов, названную \\"Краткий сборник\\" (\\"Synopsis\\"), предназначенный для медицинских студентов. С 4 по 7 век наступил период наибольшего расцвета составления византийских медицинских энциклопедий. Благодаря слиянию различных цивилизаций, медицинские знания могли проникать друг в друга и обогащать друг друга. После 9 века множество медицинских текстов, включая работы Гиппократа и Галена, было передано через Византию в арабскую и европейскую медицину, а многие древние тексты, уже утраченные в Европе, были переведены из арабского на латынь и снова вошли в европейское культурное пространство. Восточная Европа и Россия ощутили самое сильное влияние культуры Византии: в 9 веке культура Византии достигла наибольшего успеха в распространении на территории, заселенной славянами. После этого множество греческих книг было переведено на славянские языки, что заложило основу раннего развития русской медицинской терминологии."},{"prompt":"улучшите по языку","completion":"II. Предпосылки для создания русской медицинской терминологии в историческом контексте Формирование и эволюция культурного наследия любого народа являются результатом не изолированного развития, а скорее плода взаимовлияния и обмена с другими культурами. Русская медицина тоже претерпела подобные этапы эволюции, обогащаясь и впитывая в себя лучшее от иных национальных медицинских школ. Сопутствующее формирование медицинской терминологии также вышло на путь самобытного развития, прошедшего стадии заимствования и адаптации до выработки уникального национального характера. Исторические корни русской терминологической работы уходят в глубокую древность – к наследию древнегреческой, римской и Византийской культур. Источники античной медицинской терминологии можно отследить на протяжении четырёх тысячелетий до культур древней Вавилонии-Ассирии и Египта. В 2500 году до нашей эры Месопотамия дала миру первые библиотеки, содержащие клинописные таблицы с записями о медицинских знаниях. Но рациональная медицина, как мы её понимаем, зародилась в V веке до нашей эры, в период, когда древнегреческая медицина начала своё могущество. Творения Гиппократа и Аристотеля, а также обширный корпус медицинской литературы Александрийской библиотеки заложили фундамент для первоначального формирования медицинской терминологии. Древние энциклопедии, разработанные в ту эпоху, в том числе оставшиеся медицинские трактаты Цельса \\"De Medicina\\" и \\"De re medica\\" Варрона, а также \\"Материа медика\\" Диоскорида и \\"Естественная история\\" Плиния Старшего, обогащали знания в области ботаники и фармакологии. За времяпрепровождение \\"отца медицины\\" Гиппократа, во II веке нашей эры римлянин Гален выдвинулся как создатель обширной системы медицинских и биологических знаний, которая стала краеугольным камнем европейских учений на протяжении всего Средневековья. Гален создал многочисленные трактаты на греческом языке, и важно подчеркнуть что его труды выдвинули новый стандарт точности и ясности определений медицинских терминов. Это свидетельствует о начавшемся со II века процессе теоретического осмысления терминологии. Византийская культура, в свою очередь, является наследнием античных греко-римских традиций. Медицинские знания Византии опирались на труды Гиппократа и Галена. Византийские учёные-медики составляли обстоятельные медицинские энциклопедии, собирая и систематизируя известное медицинское наследие и практический опыт. Самым значительным из этих трудов считается 72-томное произведение Орибасия \\"Collecta medicinalis\\", из которого до нас дошло только 27 томов. Орибасий также сократил свой труд до 9 томов, составив \\"Synopsis\\", предназначенный для медицинских учащихся. Период с IV по VII век ознаменовался рассветом византийской энциклопедической медицины. Взаимодействие между разными цивилизациями позволило медицинским знаниям проникать и взаимно обогащать друг друга. После IX века обширный корпус медицинских текстов, включая работы Гиппократа и Галена, был передан из Византии в арабский и европейский медицинский мир. Многие древние тексты, утраченные в Европе, переводились обратно из арабских версий на латынь, обогащая европейскую культуру. Восточная Европа и Россия испытали наиболее сильное влияние византийской культуры – уже в IX веке распространение византийских традиций достигло максимального успеха в славянских землях.

Nomination of a New Justice: President Obama would have nominated a successor to fill Ginsburg's seat on the Supreme Court. Given his prior nominations of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, it is reasonable to assume that he would have sought a candidate with similar progressive credentials and a strong legal background. 2. Senate Confirmation Process: The nominated candidate would have to go through a confirmation process, which includes hearings conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vote by the full Senate. As of 2013, the Democrats held the majority in the Senate, which would have increased the likelihood that Obama's nominee would have been confirmed, assuming the nominee had no significant red flags in their background. 3. Shift in Court Dynamics: At the time of her hypothetical retirement in 2013, Justice Ginsburg was considered part of the liberal wing of the Court. If Obama had the opportunity to appoint her successor, he likely would have chosen someone with similar ideological leanings, which would have maintained the balance of the Court at that time rather than shifting it. 4. Impact on Future Cases: A new justice appointed by Obama would have contributed to the decisions and legal reasoning of the Court for potentially decades to come. This could affect rulings on crucial issues such as civil rights, reproductive rights, environmental regulations, and more, as a justice's influence extends far beyond their initial confirmation. 5. Long-Term Consequences: If Ginsburg had retired and been replaced by an Obama nominee, the composition of the Court might have been less of a concern to Democrats during the subsequent Trump presidency. Because the balance of the Court would not have changed dramatically, there might have been less urgency and controversy surrounding the appointments made by President Trump. It's important to note that Ginsberg chose not to retire during Obama's presidency, and she passed away on September 18, 2020, during Donald Trump's term. Her seat was subsequently filled by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, appointed by President Trump, which shifted the balance of the Court in a more conservative direction. This has had a significant impact on subsequent Supreme Court decisions."},{"prompt":"Combine it with the successful appointment of Merrick Garland, as Democrats won a 50+VP majority in 2016.","completion":"If we create a hypothetical scenario where Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg retired in 2013 under President Obama's administration, and where Merrick Garland was successfully appointed to the Supreme Court, while the Democrats also won a Senate majority (50 seats plus the Vice President's tie-breaking vote) in the 2016 elections, the following is what could have happened: 1. **Ginsburg's 2013 Retirement and Replacement:** When Ginsburg retires in 2013, President Obama nominates a replacement, who would likely be a liberal or moderate-liberal jurist similar to Ginsburg. Given the Democrats' control of the Senate at that time, the nominee would have a strong chance of being confirmed relatively smoothly. 2. **Success of Merrick Garland's Nomination in 2016:** President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in March 2016 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. However, in our real-world timeline, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Garland's nomination, arguing that the next president should fill the vacancy as the nomination occurred during an election year. In our hypothetical scenario, the Democratic Senate majority would proceed with Garland's confirmation hearings, and he would likely be confirmed to the bench due to the Democratic control. 3. **Democratic Control of the Senate in 2016:** If Democrats had gained control of the Senate in the 2016 elections, they would have had the necessary majority to confirm Supreme Court nominations without requiring any Republican votes, provided the caucus remained united. 4. **Supreme Court Composition:** With successful nominations of both Ginsburg's replacement in 2013 and Merrick Garland in 2016, the ideological balance of the Court would still tip towards a liberal majority since the replacement of conservative Justice Scalia with the more moderate Garland would significantly shift the Court's dynamics. This could also mean that when other vacancies arose, a Democratic-controlled Senate would likely be able to confirm replacements without significant opposition. 5. **Impact on Supreme Court Decisions:** With two new justices appointed by Obama and confirmed by a Democratic Senate, the Court's rulings in significant areas such as campaign finance, voting rights, reproductive rights, environmental law, and more could have leaned more progressive. This assumes that the new justices shared a close enough judicial philosophy to Obama's earlier appointees. 6. **Downstream Political Implications:** A Supreme Court perceived as leaning more liberal could have influenced subsequent electoral politics, potentially energizing conservative voters and possibly affecting the legislative approach of Republicans and Democrats alike. In summary, had these events occurred as described, President Obama would have left a strong and lasting impact on the judicial branch, likely resulting in a Supreme Court more inclined to uphold and expand progressive rulings. The actual makeup and decisions of the Court could have differed significantly from what we have observed in reality post-2016."},{"prompt":"Obama appointed a rare 4 judges in SCOTUS, and its aftermath, up to 2023.","completion":"If in this hypothetical scenario, President Barack Obama had the opportunity to appoint a fourth Supreme Court Justice, this would mean that by 2023, he would have appointed the following justices: 1. Justice Sonia Sotomayor – Appointed in 2009, filling the vacancy left by Justice David Souter. 2. Justice Elena Kagan – Appointed in 2010, filling the vacancy left by Justice John Paul Stevens. 3. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's replacement – Appointed in 2013, if Ginsburg had retired at that time. 4. Justice Merrick Garland – Appointed in 2016, filling the vacancy after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, assuming Senate confirmation under a hypothetical Democratic majority. With four appointments, Obama would have significantly reshaped the ideological balance of the Court, likely ensuring a liberal majority for years, possibly decades. The implications of this hypothetical scenario could include: 1. **Liberal Court Rulings:** Major decisions on contentious issues such as reproductive rights, affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, environmental regulations, healthcare, and the scope of executive power could reflect a more progressive stance, potentially solidifying or expanding liberal precedents. 2. **Confirmation Dynamics:** Future vacancies on the Court would be under intense scrutiny, with the balance of power possibly at stake. Depending on the composition of the Senate and the presidency, confirmations could either be contentious battles or straightforward if the same party holds both branches. 3. **Impact on Legislation:** A reliably liberal Court might embolden congressional Democrats to pass more progressive legislation, knowing it's less likely to be struck down. Conversely, Republicans might adjust their legislative strategies, knowing that the Court is less inclined to uphold conservative policies that are legally challenged. 4. **Electoral Consequences:** A Supreme Court perceived as politically liberal could impact the electorate. Conservative voters might be further motivated to regain control of the presidency and Senate to counteract the Court's leanings, potentially impacting congressional and presidential elections. 5. **Shift in Legal Precedents:** With a different composition of justices, certain landmark conservative decisions, like Citizens United v. FEC, could potentially be revisited or even overturned. Similarly, decisions based on a conservative interpretation of the Constitution might be less likely to occur. By 2023, the full impact of these hypothetical appointments would begin to be felt not only in the Court's rulings but also in the broader legal and sociopolitical landscape. This could mean a significant departure from current real-world issues, where the actual Supreme Court, following the appointments of Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett by President Donald Trump, has a strong conservative majority."},{"prompt":"I added Drake Cascade(born 1980, immortal, member of FedSoc until 2021) on this, to replace Gorsuch, but pulled out a Souter.","completion":"If we introduce an additional hypothetical figure, Drake Cascade, born in 1980 and immortal, who was a member of the Federalist Society until 2021 and was nominated to the Supreme Court in place of Neil Gorsuch, we would have a very different scenario.

Bush but often sided with liberal justices. Given this new development alongside the successful appointments by Obama, we can speculate on the following implications: 1. **Supreme Court Dynamics:** With Obama's four appointments and Drake Cascade replacing Gorsuch, the Supreme Court would have a clear liberal to moderate majority, drastically changing the ideological leanings of the Court. This would influence rulings and shift the precedent-setting direction of the Court. 2. **Drake Cascade's Impact:** Since Cascade is immortal, his potential influence over the long arc of American jurisprudence is significant. If he indeed turns out to be a moderating force or a liberal-leaning jurist despite his conservative resume, his impact could be profound, particularly in stabilizing or shifting the Court in unexpected ways over time. 3. **Reaction from the Federalist Society and Conservatives:** Cascade's departure from expected conservative rulings would likely lead to strong reactions from the Federalist Society and the broader conservative legal community. They might reevaluate their vetting processes for future judicial candidates to prevent another justice from diverging from expected conservative judicial philosophies. 4. **Legislative Reactions:** Knowing the Court is likely to lean liberal for an indefinite period due to Cascade's immortality and the Obama appointees, conservative lawmakers might alter their legislative strategies, perhaps choosing to avoid certain issues they expect to lose in the Court or finding new ways to advance their policy goals that are less vulnerable to judicial review. 5. **Election Implications:** The composition of the Court being decisively liberal might energize the Republican base, leading to political campaigns heavily focused on the judicial appointments of future presidents in an effort to eventually rebalance the Court. 6. **Legal Landscape by 2023:** By 2023, assuming Cascade remains a \\"Souter-like\\" figure, the legal landscape would be one where progressive rulings are more common, and where conservative legal challenges face an uphill battle. Major legal battles would be decided with an understanding that the Court is not inclined to advance a conservative judicial agenda, potentially reshaping numerous areas of American law and life. In real life, the actual composition of the Supreme Court as of the knowledge cutoff date in 2023 has a 6-3 conservative majority following the appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett during the Trump administration, which has led to significant rulings aligned with conservative principles."},{"prompt":"Cascade, began in 2018, replacing Brett Kavanaugh.

By 2020, however, the score was halved, and by 2023, he is now as liberal as his former seatholder, Kennedy.","completion":"Let's build on this elaborate hypothetical narrative. To recap and continue the scenario: 1. Drake Cascade, an immortal born in 1980 with a strong conservative background, was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2018 (in place of Brett Kavanaugh in this scenario). He was advertised as a staunch conservative, exemplified by a high Martin-Quinn score of +4.9 initially, suggesting a judicial philosophy more conservative than Justice Clarence Thomas. 2. Despite these expectations, Cascade's judicial philosophy evolved quickly over the course of two years. By 2020, his Martin-Quinn score was halved, indicating a significant shift toward the center. By 2023, his score aligns with that of Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom he replaced and who was known for being a swing vote on many decisions. 3. His nomination and confirmation, by a narrow margin of 52-48, likely reflect a heavily partisan environment and possible expectations from conservative senators that he would help solidify a conservative majority on the Court. Now let's consider the outcomes and implications in this scenario: 1. **Surprise Shift in Judicial Philosophy:** Cascade's shift from a staunch conservative to a moderate or swing vote on the Court would surprise and likely frustrate many conservatives, including likely Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and those who campaigned for his confirmation. 2. **Impact on the Supreme Court's Decisions:** Given this unexpected ideological shift, some Court decisions expected to lean conservative could now swing the other way, with Cascade potentially providing key votes in favor of more liberal outcomes on issues such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, civil liberties, and environmental regulations. 3. **Political Backlash:** Members of Congress who supported Cascade's nomination, particularly those up for reelection, may face criticism from their constituents for their role in confirming a Justice whose decisions do not align with conservative expectations. This could become a contentious issue in campaigns and primaries. 4. **Conservative Strategy in Nominations:** Future conservative nominations may be approached with increased scrutiny by the Republican Party to prevent another \\"Souter\\" or \\"Cascade\\" situation. This heightened vetting process might involve more rigorous exploration of a nominee's legal philosophy and potential for ideological shifts. 5. **Liberal and Moderate Celebration:** Liberals and moderates would likely be relieved and perhaps even celebrate the unexpected ideological balance on the Court brought by Cascade's shift. This sentiment could also affect their approach to judicial nominations and increase their confidence in bipartisan nominees. 6. **Long-term Influence:** Since Drake Cascade is immortal, his evolving jurisprudence could have an enduring, transformative effect on American law. His ability to continuously adapt to new legal landscapes, societal changes, and emerging issues could make him a pivotal figure in the Court's history. 7. **Shaping of Judicial Legacy:** By 2023, given Cascade's change in judicial stance, his legacy would begin to be formed not only by the decisions he has participated in but also by his unpredictable ideological journey and its impact on the Court and the country. In real life, ideological shifts among Supreme Court justices are not unheard of, though they usually occur over more extended periods. This narrative depicts a dramatic and swift evolution in a Justice's philosophy, alongside the presence of immortality, adding a complex and fantastical element to Supreme Court dynamics and its long-term implications."},{"prompt":"On 2021, Cascade authored the majority opinion to repeal Citizens United and earlier conservative court cases, leading to GOP losing as much as 3 seats in Senate and 35 seats in the House, on the 2022 midterms.","completion":"In this further continuation of the hypothetical scenario, if Justice Drake Cascade authored the majority opinion to repeal Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and earlier conservative court cases in 2021, there would be significant repercussions both politically and legally. 1. **Legal Repercussions of Repealing Citizens United:** The Citizens United decision, made in 2010, held that political spending by corporations, associations, and labor unions is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment, and it effectively allowed for unlimited independent political expenditures. Overturning this decision would be a landmark shift in campaign finance law, likely leading to the reinstatement of various restrictions on corporate and union spending in political campaigns. 2. **Political Fallout:** The reversal of Citizens United could lead to immediate changes in how campaigns are financed in the United States. Limits on corporate and perhaps individual campaign spending could reduce the influence of money in politics, evening out the playing field for candidates without substantial financial backing. 3. **Impact on the GOP:** The hypothetical loss of seats for Republicans in the Senate and House could be attributed to several factors post-Citizens United reversal: - The Republican Party may have become more reliant on large political expenditures from corporations and wealthy donors to influence elections, and stricter campaign finance laws could hinder their ability to raise and spend money compared to Democrats. - Public opinion might swing against the GOP if the repeal was popular. Citizens United was contentious and led to widespread concern about the influence of money in politics, so its repeal could be celebrated by many voters. 4. **Midterm Elections:** Traditionally, the party that does not control the presidency gains seats during the midterm elections. The 2022 midterms would defy this trend in this scenario, possibly because the repeal of Citizens United galvanized voters who had become disenchanted with the outsized influence of money in politics. 5. **Shift in Political Strategy:** Political parties and candidates would likely have to adjust their campaign strategies significantly. They would be compelled to rely more on small donors, grassroots fundraising efforts, and perhaps public funding options (where available), modifying the political landscape to focus more on direct voter engagement. The long-term consequences of such a decision would influence American politics for generations, making it likely the most significant contribution of the immortal Justice Cascade to the legal framework governing U.S. elections. It's important to note that, in reality, overturning a Supreme Court precedent—especially a relatively recent one such as Citizens United—would require an extremely compelling justification, as the Court usually follows the principle of stare decisis (to stand by things decided), respecting its prior rulings for the sake of legal stability."},{"prompt":"In 2022, Cascade declares himself an immortal judge, and the GOP hoped that he is wrong on his statement.","completion":"Continuing with this creative hypothetical scenario where Justice Drake Cascade is indeed immortal, his public declaration of immortality in 2022 would have significant implications: 1. **Public and Legal Shock:** A statement by a Supreme Court justice claiming immortality would be unprecedented and sensational. Both the public and the legal community would likely react with a combination of skepticism, disbelief, and fascination. 2. **GOP Reactions:** If Republicans were already dismayed by Cascade's judicial shift and his role in repealing Citizens United, they might hold onto hope that his claim of immortality is a delusion or a metaphorical statement rather than a literal fact. His previous conservative backers might feel a sense of betrayal and view his self-proclaimed immortality as yet another unexpected twist. 3. **Political Ramifications:** If Cascade's immortality claim is true, political parties would have to come to terms with the fact that his influence on the Court could extend indefinitely. This would be particularly concerning for the GOP if Cascade continues to author decisions that counter conservative principles. His existence would become a constant in American jurisprudence, which could influence everything from party platforms to strategies around judicial appointments. 4. **Constitutional Questions:** The U.S. Constitution does not consider the possibility of an immortal judge. Life tenure for Supreme Court justices is based on the assumption of human mortality. Cascade's immortality would raise complex questions about the intent of life tenure and whether there should be limits on the service length of Supreme Court justices. 5. **Judicial Precedent and Legal Interpretations:** An immortal Justice Cascade would have an unparalleled opportunity to shape legal precedent over time. His evolving interpretations of the law could influence countless future decisions and the development of American jurisprudence. 6. **Long-term Effect on the Supreme Court:** Cascade's extended tenure would affect the dynamics of the Court and the appointment process for other justices. It could also influence how future justices think about their legacies and long-term impacts. 7. **Cultural and Social Impact:** An immortal individual confirming their status would raise profound questions beyond the legal sphere, touching on ethics, religion, and the nature of human existence. This would likely make him a figure of public and cultural fascination, and the story would go well beyond the usual discussions of a Supreme Court justice. As fascinating as this storyline is, it's important to remember that this is a fictional scenario, and in reality, all Supreme Court justices are mortal. Life tenure for Supreme Court justices is stated in Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution and typically ends upon the justice’s death, retirement, or impeachment and subsequent removal. The unusual circumstances outlined here provide an interesting thought experiment on the long-term influence of justices and the balance of power within the U.S. government."},{"prompt":"And as it happened, If Drake's immortality claims went true, he would be forced to become a swing or balancing vote to prevent from being impeached.","completion":"If Justice Drake Cascade's claim of immortality were indeed true, and he became concerned about the threat of impeachment due to his potentially endless tenure on the Supreme Court, it's possible he might decide to adopt a role as a \\"swing\\" or \\"balancing\\" vote to avoid creating too much controversy or dissatisfaction with his judicial decisions. Here's how that notion could play out in the context of the hypothetical scenario: 1. **Impeachment Concerns:** No Supreme Court justice has ever been successfully impeached and removed from office, but justices can be impeached for, among other things, \\"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\" While immortality is not grounds for impeachment, the extraordinary circumstance might lead to heightened scrutiny and pressure. 2. **Need for Judicial Balance:** As an immortal justice, Cascade might believe that by taking a centrist or unpredictable position on cases, he could mitigate partisanship concerns and avoid becoming the target of impeachment efforts by any political faction disturbed by his endless influence. 3. **Prevent Polarization:** By positioning himself as a swing vote, Cascade could aim to reduce the extremes of polarization on the Court. This role could be seen as essential to ensuring the Court remains a stabilizing institution within American democracy, particularly given his unique and unending tenure. 4. **Building Consensus:** A commitment to building consensus among his fellow justices might reduce the likelihood of him being seen as ideologically extreme or out of touch, thereby diminishing the impetus for impeachment. 5. **Strategic Judging:** Operating as a swing vote would require careful consideration of legal arguments and the broader implications of the Court's rulings. In contentious cases, Cascade would have the power to tip the scales and might choose to side with the ideological bloc that he believes presents the stronger legal argument or that promotes stability and public confidence in the judiciary. 6. **Maintaining Institutional Integrity:** Cascade might also see his role as vital to maintaining the integrity of the Supreme Court as an institution, ensuring it remains above the political fray and faithful to the Constitution, despite the potential for significant societal and political changes over the centuries. 7. **Perception by the Public and Politicians:** A balanced approach to decision-making may help Cascade maintain public respect and avoid becoming a lightning rod for political controversy, thus limiting calls for his impeachment. However, it's important to note that in real-world practice, impeachment for a Supreme Court justice is exceptionally rare and has not been successful since the early days of the United States. Moreover, the Constitution provides life tenure for justices \\"during good Behaviour,\\" which typically has not been interpreted as including decisions that may be ideologically controversial. Final thoughts: While this thought experiment offers an interesting exploration of judicial philosophy and the political dynamics of the Supreme Court, it also touches on the timeless debate of how justices should interpret the law—strictly by legal texts or with consideration to evolving societal norms. In the real-world context, Supreme Court justices sometimes do shift their views or become swing votes, but the reasons for such changes are usually complex, deeply personal, and rooted in the law rather than hypothetical immortality."},{"prompt":"Because of this Cascade halted his Souter thing, and just stopped at +0.5. but the damage has already been done against GOP.","completion":"In this continuation of the imaginative storyline where Justice Drake Cascade has halted his ideological shift and settled at a Martin-Quinn score of +0.5, indicating a position slightly right-of-center: 1. **Stabilization of Judicial Philosophy:** Cascade's decision to maintain a relatively centrist position on the Court (+0.5 being close to centrist but leaning conservative) signals his attempt to bring stability to his judicial decision-making. This choice might be perceived as an effort to be seen as a fair-minded jurist rather than an ideologue. 2. **Retrospective View:** The period in which Cascade authored progressive-leaning decisions, including the repeal of Citizens United, may be looked back upon as a defining era in his tenure. These earlier decisions may continue to have long-lasting effects on the political landscape and campaign finance law. 3. **Republican Party Reaction:** Although Cascade has moderated his position, the changes he helped bring about, perceived as detrimental by the GOP, cannot be undone simply by his stabilization as a centrist justice. The Republican Party might recognize the need to adapt to the new legal realities established by Cascade's prior rulings. 4. **Democratic Party Strategy:** Democrats may be disappointed if they assumed that Cascade would consistently side with liberal positions given his earlier decisions. However, with his current centrist stance, he could still be a deciding vote in closely contested cases, meaning both parties would need to present strong legal arguments that could appeal to his judicial philosophy. 5. **Public Perception:** Americans, and particularly those interested in the Supreme Court, may view Cascade with a sense of unpredictability, given his shift from a conservative to a centrist justice. His legacy could be one of evolving ideologies rather than static conservatism as initially expected. 6. **Political Losses:** The \\"damage\\" to the GOP mentioned involves losses in the House and Senate, which may be attributed to Cascade's swing vote in key rulings that displeased the conservative base. The role of a Supreme Court justice's rulings on electoral outcomes is complex and multifaceted, but high-profile decisions can certainly impact public opinion and voter turnout. 7. **Influence on Future Court Dynamics:** Despite Cascade halting his ideological drift, his influence on the Court remains significant due to his position as a potentially crucial swing vote and his purported immortality. He may continue to shape the nation's laws and values far into the future. It's important to recognize that in our real world, the individual positions of Supreme Court justices often vary case by case, and their Martin-Quinn scores can fluctuate over time based on the decisions they join or author. In reality, justices, including swing votes, often base their rulings on legal principles rather than a predetermined judicial ideology. The dynamics of the Supreme Court are complex, and while the personal philosophies of justices play a role, so too do the specific legal questions at the heart of the cases before them."},{"prompt":"He called to Democrats that he would eventually side with them, if he gets disappointed on Republicans' policies.","completion":"Continuing with this fictional narrative, if Justice Drake Cascade made an overture to the Democratic Party, suggesting he might side with them in the future should he become disappointed with Republican policies, several outcomes could unfold: 1. **Politically Compromised Position:** Supreme Court justices traditionally strive to maintain an image of impartiality and are expected to adjudicate without allegiance to political parties. By indicating a willingness to side with Democrats in response to political developments, Cascade could undermine perceptions of his judicial neutrality. 2. **Erosion of Public Confidence:** Such a statement might erode public confidence in the Supreme Court as a nonpartisan institution. The Court's legitimacy relies partly on the belief that justices rule based on their interpretation of the law and the Constitution, not partisan considerations. 3. **Constitutional Concerns:** Cascade's stance could provoke constitutional debates about the role of justices and the importance of judicial independence. It might lead to discussions regarding potential reforms, such as imposing term limits on justices or creating a more formal process for checking potential biases. 4. **Impact on the Democratic Party:** Democrats might be cautiously optimistic about Cascade's statement, but also wary of relying on the promise of a justice's future support. The independence of the judiciary is a principle that transcends party lines, and the Democrats would likely be cognizant of the potential backlash and challenges posed by a justice appearing to align with them. 5. **Impact on the Republican Party:** This development could alarm Republicans, potentially prompting questions about Cascade's loyalty and legal philosophy. It may deepen existing concerns about his appointment and the decisions that led to their losses in Congress. 6. **Future Court Dynamics:** Cascade's announcement could affect the dynamics among the justices on the Court, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of his votes and opinions. His colleagues might question his motivations and the extent to which they can collaborate with him in forming majorities and crafting opinions. 7. **Legislative Strategies:** Lawmakers might adjust their legislative approaches in anticipation of how Cascade might rule on laws that are challenged in the Supreme Court. Both parties may consider the potential for judicial review when crafting new legislation. In essence, a Supreme Court justice sending partisan signals, as described for Justice Cascade, would be contrary to the principles of judicial impartiality and could lead to significant controversy and discussion of judicial ethics. This development could have profound implications for the workings of the Supreme Court, the separation of powers, and the public's trust in the judicial system. In reality, the independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of the United States legal system, and justices seek to avoid any appearances of partisanship or political alignment in their decision-making process. Statements from justices that suggest a predisposition to side with a particular political party would be met with significant scrutiny and potentially could trigger calls for responses including judicial conduct inquiries or even discussion of impeachment, though actual impeachment for such statements would be unprecedented and highly controversial."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

The unmatched jolt from a fruitful deal is memorable, of course, but the actual fuel for my passion is constructing atmospheres where all are buzzing with excitement and feeling extraordinary. 7. It's a given that the charge from a successful negotiation is intense, but what truly propels me forward is creating realms where everyone is brimming with energy and feels supremely capable. 8.

Of course, the energetic pulse you get from finalizing a successful deal is unrivaled, but the heart of my drive thrives on crafting spaces where everyone is motivated and feels like a hero in their own story. Whether at the helm or going it alone, I’m all for blending a little fun with our accomplishments. 3.

On the large, plush couch under a window, SISTER (18) with long hair tied up in a casual bun, lounges with one leg folded under her. She wears a black tank-top and daisy dukes, her style carefree yet edgy. Absorbed in her phone, her thumb flicks with rhythmic precision through an endless feed of social media posts. Beside her, BROTHER (12), a mop of unruly hair crowning his head, cuddles close, his arms wrapped around her waist. He's the picture of comfort in his white t-shirt and trackpants, the epitome of a kid on his day off. His eyes are closed, a contented smile on his face as he enjoys the simple luxury of being close to his sister. The television is on, a low-volume anime soundtrack filling in any potential gaps in the quiet. Dust particles dance in the sunbeams, but neither sibling seems to notice or care. SISTER (sighs, nose wrinkled in distaste) Ugh, can you believe these nails? She angles her phone to show BROTHER, but he doesn't look, instead snuggling tighter into her side. BROTHER (murmuring) Mhm, weird. SISTER (rolling her eyes, but with a hint of a smile) You didn't even look. But they're like talons! I swear, some trends are just too much. BROTHER (nestling contentedly) Who cares... This is nice. SISTER (shaking her head but smirking) You're just a big teddy bear, you know that? No help with fashion crimes at all. Halfway serious, halfway playful, she gently nudges him with her elbow, but BROTHER merely hums in agreement, unperturbed. SISTER returns her attention to her phone once again, a barrage of colors and sounds only she's privy to. The tick of a clock is heard, marking the comfortable silence that remains. They sit in tranquility, the outside world continuing on while they remain in their peaceful bubble, the bond of siblings making even a lazy afternoon feel like a memory worth savoring. BROTHER (sleepily) Hey, can we get pizza for dinner? SISTER (smirking, not looking up) Only if you can order it without moving from here. BROTHER (thoughtfully) Challenge accepted. The camera zooms out slowly, the sounds of a distant lawn mower and the quiet hum of suburban life gently encroaching on the cozy scene. The siblings remain in their bubble of contentment, the world turning without rush around them.

Часто блейзеры шьются из ткани с металлическими пуговицами и нашивными карманами, имеют более свободный крой и предназначены для неформальной или полуформальной носки. 2. **Спортивные команды:** Термин \\"Blazers\\" также можно использовать как краткое название для спортивных команд. Например, Portland Trail Blazers — это профессиональная баскетбольная команда в НБА из Портленда, штат Орегон. 3. **Автомобили:** Chevrolet Blazer — это марка автомобилей, в частности, внедорожников и кроссоверов, производимых компанией Chevrolet, подразделением General Motors. 4. **Прозвища:* Если \\"The Blazer\\" используется как прозвище или псевдоним, возможно, это относится к какой-то известной личности, персонажу из фильма, книги или видеоигры или представителю публичной сферы.

Однако, существует ограничение: браузеры не поддерживают прямое подключение через Telnet по соображениям безопасности. Вам потребуется серверный прокси, который будет перенаправлять данные между клиентом и Telnet-сервером игры. Такой серверный прокси может быть написан, например, на Node.js с использованием пакетов \`net\` для Telnet-соединения и \`ws\` или \`socket.io\` для WebSocket-соединения с клиентским веб-приложением.

Cela signifie que l'emplacement du serveur qui envoie le courriel ne reflète pas nécessairement la localisation géographique de l'utilisateur. Toutefois, il existe des moyens limités par lesquels une tentative de localisation peut être faite : - **Tracking Pixel :** Si vous envoyez un e-mail et que le destinataire ouvre l'email, un pixel de suivi (s'il est intégré) peut rapporter l'adresse IP de l'ouverture de l'email, qui peut parfois être utilisée pour obtenir une localisation grossière. Cependant, cela est de plus en plus inefficace car beaucoup de clients de messagerie bloquent ce genre de suivi. - **En-têtes d'Email :** Quelques fois, vous pouvez examiner les en-têtes d'e-mail pour identifier l'adresse IP de l'expéditeur, pour autant que l'email n'ait pas été envoyé via un webmail. Cependant, cette adresse IP est souvent celle du serveur de messagerie plutôt que celle de l'utilisateur. - **Analyse des métadonnées :** Si l'adresse e-mail a été utilisée pour enregistrer des comptes sur des sites web, des forums, ou des médias sociaux, il est possible que des détails sur la localisation (ou ce que l'utilisateur a fourni) puissent être découverts, mais cela nécessiterait des investigations plus poussées. Il est important de noter que, à moins d'être menées par des autorités compétentes et pour des raisons légitimes, les tentatives de localisation d'une adresse e-mail sans consentement peuvent être considérées comme une violation de la vie privée et poser des problèmes éthiques et juridiques. Pour les situations concernant des activités illégales ou la recherche de personnes disparues, des experts forensiques informatiques travaillant de concert avec les autorités légales peuvent tenter des localisations plus poussées, mais toujours dans le cadre de processus légaux bien définis."},{"prompt":"Comment faire avec le trackiing pixel","completion":"Le tracking pixel, souvent appelé pixel espion ou pixel de suivi, est une petite image généralement de 1 pixel x 1 pixel qui est insérée dans un email et qui est servie depuis un serveur externe. Lorsque le destinataire ouvre l'email et que l'image est chargée, le serveur qui fournit l'image est capable de recueillir certaines informations, comme l'adresse IP du destinataire, le type de client de messagerie qu'il utilise, l'heure à laquelle l'email est ouvert, et parfois s'il a été transféré. Pour utiliser un tracking pixel, suivez les étapes suivantes : 1. **Création du Pixel de Suivi :** Vous devez avoir accès à un serveur web où vous pourrez héberger l'image de 1x1 pixels. Vous pouvez créer un pixel de suivi soit en programmant une petite image GIF transparente de 1x1 pixel, soit en utilisant des services tiers spécialisés dans le suivi des emails qui généreront le tracking pixel pour vous. 2. **Insertion dans l'Email :** Insérez l'image de suivi en tant qu'image cachée dans le contenu HTML de votre email. Vous devez vous assurer que l'image est référencée avec une URL externe de votre serveur web : \`\`\`html <img src=\\"http://votreserveur.com/pixel.gif\\" width=\\"1\\" height=\\"1\\" /> \`\`\` 3. **Configuration du Serveur :** Votre serveur doit être configuré pour enregistrer les détails des requêtes reçues chaque fois que l'image de 1x1 pixel est demandée. Les informations recueillies peuvent inclure l'heure, la date, l'adresse IP et le type de client email. 4. **Analyse des Données :** Après que le destinataire ait ouvert l'email, examinez les données recueillies par votre serveur pour essayer d'en déterminer la localisation. Vous pouvez ensuite utiliser un service de géolocalisation IP pour tenter de tracer l'adresse IP à une localisation géographique approximative. Il est crucial de comprendre que l'utilisation de tracking pixels soulève des questions importantes en matière de consentement et de protection de la vie privée. En Europe, l'utilisation de tels outils doit être conforme au Règlement Général sur la Protection des Données (RGPD), ce qui implique d'informer les destinataires que vous utilisez des pixels de suivi et pourquoi. Obtenez également leur consentement avant d'utiliser le pixel. Beaucoup de clients de messagerie modernes bloquent les images par défaut ou avertissent les utilisateurs lorsqu'un email contient des images externes pour précisément ces raisons de confidentialité, ce qui limite l'efficacité des pixels espions. Faites également attention à la législation locale concernant la confidentialité et la surveillance. Assurez-vous de rester dans le cadre légal lors de l'utilisation de techniques de suivi."},{"prompt":"I am working on a cinematic game intro for my dark fantasy game similar to dark souls 3.

In prayer, she pleads to heavens bound, Unknowing of the dark profound, A shadow's promise lingers near, By man's ambition, gripped by fear. The Goddess's grace, a shining pyre, Unquenched by mortal's dark desire, Yet blades unseen through silence cleave, And at her alter, they deceive. One betwixt, one beside, Together ride the eventide, Assassins bold in her domain, To slit the thread of Life's refrain. Seraphine falls, her form alight, A goddess dimmed into the night. Immortality’s cruel jest, For in their deeds, they're now confessed. Ascend they now, her power sown, Into their flesh, their sins atone, Forever marked by what they chose, Immortal life in darkness grows.

LIVING ROOM - DAY The afternoon sun spills through the blinds, casting stripes across the cozy living room where YUJI, a 12-year-old boy with tousled hair, and AKARI, his 18-year-old sister with her hair in a messy bun, sprawl lazily on a well-worn couch. Yuji is clad in a simple white t-shirt and gray track pants, while Akari sports a casual black tank-top paired with frayed daisy dukes. Yuji snuggles against Akari’s side, his arms clinging onto her as if she were a human-sized plush toy. Akari's attention, however, is riveted to the smartphone in her hand, her thumbs flicking across the screen in a ceaseless scroll. Yuji (mumbling affectionately): You're always here when I need a hug, Akari. Akari doesn’t respond—her focus unbreakable as she surfs through the endless sea of social media. Her face is a mask of apathy, brows furrowing only when a certain image catches her eye. Akari (grimacing): Ugh, look at these nails, Yuji. How do they even type with these? She turns her phone towards Yuji, showing off a vibrant image of outrageously long and glittery fake nails. Yuji glances at the screen, unimpressed, then shrugs. Yuji: Maybe they don't. Maybe the nails do all the work. They both chuckle at the absurdity but quickly sink back into the comfortable silence of their lazy afternoon. Akari resumes her scrolling while Yuji tightens his hug a little, content in the cozy embrace of his sister's presence. Yuji (closing his eyes snugly): Akari, we should be productive today. Do something fun! Akari (wearing an ironic smirk): Isn’t this fun? Besides, I'm being super productive... in my digital social life. Yuji sighs and squeezes her slightly, accepting their mutual laziness. Yuji (playfully): One day, these arms are gonna be so strong from all this hugging... You'll see, I'll be a hugging champion. Akari (laughing gently): Sure, Yuji, you'll rule the world with your hugs. A beat of contentment passes between them, their soft laughter filling the room. They settle deeper into the couch, an island of sibling affection and idle relaxation amidst the pace of the world outside.

Please, write me a good reddit post about why Aegon II being more loved by his father Viserys I (in the show House of the Dragon) wouldn't helped to asoif the war. A premise: some fans claim that if king Viserys I put more attention to his firstborn son, he would have grown a better man and wouldn't feel so butter about his sister and therefore wouldn't follow his mother's insistence to usurp it after the king's death. Your task is disprove it.","completion":"Title: The Heart of the Dragon – Why Viserys I’s Love for Aegon II Couldn’t Douse the Flames of War As the echoes of fiery debates resound through the \\"House of the Dragon\\" fandom, a compelling discussion emerges from the smoldering ashes – could King Viserys I's affection (or lack thereof) for his firstborn son, Aegon II, have prevented the blood-soaked dance of dynastic strife? Some hold to the tender belief that love from a father could have steered Aegon II from the path of bitterness, reshaping him into a man who would walk away from ambition’s sharp edges and into the embrace of family unity. However, such sentiment, while touching, underestimates the complexity woven into the Targaryen tapestry and the war's inexorable nature. Let us unfurl the scrolls of history and examine why a father’s love, while a powerful force, was unlikely to assuage the burning conquest that Aegon II's heart housed. **The Seed of Conflict: Ambition Beyond Affection** The House Targaryen was never a simple family, and love, while treasured, was oftentimes a secondary consideration to the grandeur of power. The leviathan that was ambition slumbered in the depths of every Targaryen heart, and none were exempt. Aegon II, instilled with the sighs of dragons' might from cradle to crypt, knew that his destiny was greater than the love of any one man, even a king. His ambition was not birthed from paternal neglect but from the very nature of Targaryen inheritance and the burden of a colossal legacy. **The Pawn of Prophecy: Heirs and the Throne's Siren Song** Aegon II was not merely a child longing for paternal assurance; he was an heir, a potential avatar of his house's indomitable will. Viserys I's affection could never sing louder than the siren song of the Iron Throne. The mere existence of Aegon II, a male heir in the shadow of dynastic traditions favoring sons, was a beacon that called to those hungry for a return to the old ways. His mother, his supporters – they all were agents of a prophecy that whispered of greatness. A father's love, however genuine and deep, can hardly be expected to quench the thirst for power imbued by the very society that shaped him. **The Sister’s Shadow: Rivalry Beyond Resentment** Fans positing that Aegon II's envy and bitterness toward his sister, Rhaenyra, precipitated the conflict, may overlook the structural animosity installed by primogeniture and gender prejudices in the era. Aegon's rivalry with Rhaenyra was less personal vendetta and more a manifestation of societal expectations clashing with a father's unconventional choice. His sister was groomed as heir apparent – a role traditionally not reserved for daughters. If resentment festered, it was surely not solely due to a lack of paternal adoration, but because the political scales were already tipped precariously by this novel arrangement. **The Dance of Inevitability: A War Foretold** When Viserys I declared Rhaenyra as his heir, the die was cast. The courtiers, the lords, yes, even the common folk, all knew regardless of the love between a father and son, the stage was set. Promises made and oaths sworn in years past had destined the Seven Kingdoms for discord. Aegon II became a banner around which the disgruntled and power-hungry could rally, a symbol of a struggle that eclipsed one man’s paternal care. It was the culmination of years of brewing tension, ready to spill over into war at the slightest of provocations. **The Final Tally: A Conflagration Born of Legacy** Thus, a profound affection from Viserys I for Aegon II is a heartening notion but is ultimately a romanticized illusion against the gritty backdrop of political realism. No amount of fatherly love could have extinguished the flames of civil war in Westeros, for those flames were fueled by a legacy of dragonfire and blood, ambition, and tradition. It was, in essence, a Dance with Dragons – a dance that Aegon II and all of Westeros were fated to perform, regardless of their hearts’ desires. In conclusion, while we are often drawn to the ideals of affection as resolution to conflict, we must acknowledge that in the game of thrones, legacy and ambition often hold greater sway than the softer beats of the human heart. Aegon II's ascension to the throne and the ensuing war were less about a neglected child's yearning and more about the inexorable pull of power and the history from which it springs.

Hey fellow GoT enthusiasts and House of the Dragon aficionados, A hot topic's been swirling around the fan tavern lately: the idea that if Viserys I had just shown his son Aegon II a bit more fatherly love, maybe, just maybe, we wouldn't have witnessed the epic, continent-scarring tantrum that was the Targaryen civil war. But seriously, folks, let's strap on our maester's chains of skepticism and delve into why this \\"love conquers all\\" notion, as heartwarming as it sounds, doesn't quite fly in the face of good ol' Westerosi politics. **Ambition: It's in the Blood** First off, the Targaryen house isn't your average family next door. We're talking about a lineage where ambition runs thicker than blood – and they have both by the bucket. Aegon II was never just a kid wanting to play catch with dad; he was born with a crown looming over his cradle. His ambition wasn't handed down by Viserys through some tough-love parenting. Nope, it was encoded in those infamous Valyrian genes and fanned by the dragonbreath of power politics. **Prophecy and Thrones** Now, let's chat about being the 'chosen one.' Aegon II was shaped to be more than just Viserys' offspring; he's the potential future of the dynasty. And, come on, when has the promise of taking the Iron Throne ever been drowned out by family feelings? The voices rooting for Aegon II were loud and they weren't just whispering sweet nothings; they were promising power, tradition, and the chance to be the name in the history books. **Sisterly Rivalry or Sibling Scheming?** I bet some fans think Aegon II's grudge against his sis, Rhaenyra, was about sibling jealousy gone medieval. But let's be real – the stakes were always higher than who got the bigger slice of lemon cake at dinner. Rhaenyra was heir, shaking up the whole male-heir-preference thing. Any bitterness from Aegon II was just as much about his place in the pecking order as it was about Viserys I playing dad-of-the-year. **It's Not a Dance; It's Destiny** Let's not kid ourselves; when Viserys named Rhaenyra as his successor, it wasn't going to be smooth sailing. The court was primed for a showdown, with every lord and their mother waiting for a spark to light the wildfire. Even if Viserys had showered Aegon II with all the love in the Seven Kingdoms, it wouldn't have cooled the hot heads eager for a scrap. Aegon II became the flag to rally behind – not because he was a neglected son, but because he represented a chance to shake things up. **In Conclusion: Love's Not Always the Answer** Cute as it would be to think that Viserys could have steered Aegon II away from the path of war with a big ol' bear hug, Westeros doesn't work like that. The Targaryen civil war wasn't sparked by a daddy issue – it was the product of an entire society playing with matches and sitting on a powder keg. A war of succession was incoming with or without daddy's little boy feeling snubbed. So, as much as we'd like to blame it all on a lack of paternal affection, the truth is that Westeros is a breeding ground for the ambitious and the power-hungry, not the tender-hearted. What do you guys think? Could Viserys have prevented the war with a bit more TLC, or was Aegon II always destined to let his dragon out to play, family feelings be darned? Drop your thoughts and let's have a friendly joust in the comments – no dragons necessary! [Slide into the comment section with your lore-laden lances drawn, fam. The discussion thread is open!]"},{"prompt":"Now add considerations whether Viserys giving Aegon II and his second son Aemon titles of lords could have postponed the war a bit z9for a generation?).","completion":"Title: A Family Affair: Could Noble Titles Have Postponed the Targaryen Throwdown? What's shaking, Westeros watchers and dragon dreamers? We've been tossing around the idea that maybe if King Viserys I had dished out some extra fatherly affection, Aegon II might've turned from bratty prince to benevolent brother, and the whole civil war drama could've been avoided. But hold your direwolves – what if Viserys had played a different type of daddy card? Would bestowing lordly titles upon Aegon II and his younger bro, Aemon, have applied the brakes to the impending family fender-bender? Let's dive in dragon-first and chew on this meathook of an idea. **The Lordly Leash: A Power Move or Just Pawing at the Problem?** Handing out lordly titles like they're candy tossed from a parade float sounds sweet in theory. Aegon II as Lord of, let's say, Dragonstone, and Aemon with a little lordship of his own could've been appeasing in the short-term. It's like giving the kids the keys to the car, hoping they won't notice you didn't fill up the tank. **A Temporary Truce?** Sure, with their own slices of the realm to manage, the boys might've been too busy toiling away at their lordly duties to bother with sibling squabbles. They'd have lands to oversee, bannermen to boss around, and maybe – just maybe – a delayed dance-off for the Iron Throne. A generation out of sight could mean a generation of conflict out of mind, right? **The Catch: Delayed Doom Is Still Doom** But let's not get too starry-eyed, the Targaryen drama is stickier than a 3-day-old kidney pie. Plopping titles on our not-so-merry band of brothers might have just whetted their appetites for the whole seven-course royal feast. A knee-jerk reaction like ennobling the young dragons could've backfired, as they'd grow their power bases, rally support, and maybe come back with even bigger armies for a family spat. Plus, you can bet your favorite maester's chain that all those lords and ladies with hungering eyes would've had more time and reasons to play team Aegon or team Rhaenyra. **The Heart of the Matter** Truth be told, noble titles or not, the heart of the issue remains a throne too small for two butts, especially when those butts belong to Targaryens. Would Viserys giving out lordships have postponed the inevitable? Maybe. Or maybe it would've just handed Aegon II and Aemon the resources they needed to bring even more fire and (literal) blood to the fight. What do you guys think? Could Viserys have pressed pause on the war by upping Aegon and Aemon to Lords of their own corners, or would it just set the stage for a bigger, badder clash down the line? Share your theories, crack a joke or two (we're all friends of the realm here), and let's hash it out. Maybe together we can solve the Targaryen family drama... or just make ourselves feel smarter before the next episode drops.

If December was coming to an end, that meant there were roughly three weeks left until January 20th. \\"Going a few days early must be for adjusting to the time difference or something.\\" That was correct. It took into account the time difference between Korea and LA, as well as Kang Woojin's condition during the audition and screen test. It would take at least a day to adapt anyway. Woojin had been to LA quite often, but this was the first time he was going with such determination. Moreover, since the film company was the 'Big Five' 'Columbia Studio', it was a natural decision for CEO Choi Seonggeon to go a few days early. Kang Woojin seemed to understand as he slowly nodded his head. Then he checked the next message. -CEO: Also, got an email from Disney. It's a confirmation for the 'Beauty and the Beast' candidate actors. Here, Woojin felt somewhat relieved.

In retrospect, it wasn't wrong. In fact, 'World Disney Pictures' had delayed their response after the preliminary meeting. Woojin didn't show it due to his professionalism, but he was a bit anxious. 'Beauty and the Beast' seemed like it would be fun too. It was a project filled with memories. If it didn't work out, there was no need to cling to it, but if it could work out, it was better to go for it, right? \\"The rating is high too.\\" Regardless, Kang Woojin was confirmed as a candidate actor for 'Beauty and the Beast', which had been slightly delayed. Although the official announcement had not yet been thrown to the world, it was only a matter of time. With this, Kang Woojin was. \\"Two out of the Big Five? That's impressive.\\" He had stamped his candidacy as an actor in major productions by the Hollywood giants 'Columbia Studio' and 'World Disney Pictures'. Although he was still a candidate, Woojin's mindset was already as if he had secured the roles. \\"They're both mine.\\" He was confident. Of course, so was his pocket dimension. So when would 'World Disney Pictures' announce their candidate actors? A brief curiosity crossed his mind, but Woojin quickly dismissed the thought. He chalked it up to a happy anticipation. His imagination ran wild. 'Pierrot' alone had caused such a stir domestically and internationally, and if 'Beauty and the Beast', which had a huge fan base worldwide beyond Korea and Japan, were to explode, it would be more than dazzling. Even the brief thought sent a thrilling sensation through Kang Woojin. There might be controversies or negative comments. \\"It doesn't concern me.\\" Woojin wouldn't be affected by it. That's when it happened. -♬♪ A subtle yet slightly melancholic music filled the entire theater. The lights dimmed. On the front screen, the advertisements had ended, and 'The Stranger' had officially started. Woojin switched his phone to silent mode and shoved it into his long padding coat pocket. \\"It's been a while.\\" He was talking about watching a movie in a theater as an audience member. The last one he saw was probably - 'Detective Agency'? Suddenly, Kang Woojin chuckled as he remembered his friends' faces filled with shock and horror from that time. Then. -Swish. Woojin crossed his legs and focused on the screen. The seats around him were more than half full, despite some empty spots. For a morning show, it was a considerable number. All of them were as focused on 'The Stranger' as Woojin was. On the screen, 'Iyota Kiyoshi', that is, Kang Woojin, made his first appearance. An emotionless face, a bland expression, soulless gestures, a withered mood. Watching his own face fill the large screen, Woojin felt a bit embarrassed. \\"Still - it's a bit embarrassing to watch myself in a work.\\" On the other hand, the hundreds of audience members around him watched the screen in bated breath. The intense atmosphere only thickened as the play progressed. Woojin's multiple personality acting from the beginning, the emotionless piano performance, and the first 'assignment' he undertook. And the first 'plan'. [\\"One person is fine, but all nine is too much. Not enough strength. Not enough brains. Not enough experience.\\"] The unexpected content widened the eyes of the hundreds of audience members. But 'The Stranger' didn't give them a break. The second 'assignment' on the boat and someone's suicide to cause confusion, followed by the appearance of a detective chasing 'Iyota Kiyoshi'. The running time of 'The Stranger' was by no means short, but the hundreds of audience members in the theater. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" They were so engrossed they forgot to go to the bathroom. Soon, the screen showed Kang Woojin's crying after completing the last 'assignment'. It was the first time the dry character showed emotion. At this point, most of the audience gasped. Then the ending. Kang Woojin, as a stranger among many citizens, looked at the audience. His demeanor was calm and quiet, but unlike the beginning, there was a spark in his eyes. The screen gradually zoomed in on Woojin's face until it filled the screen, then turned black while majestic music played. 'The Stranger' ended, and the ending credits rolled. At the same time. \\"Wow - seriously insane.\\" \\"Super fun.\\" \\"Seriously, what is Kang Woojin? His acting is... possessed.\\" Even after the movie ended, the audience couldn't leave their seats and expressed their sincere admiration. \\"Chills! This is totally a Kang Woojin one-man show movie!\\" \\"Agreed, he carries the whole thing without a single boring moment, right??\\" Most of them felt that way. \\"Kang Woojin's acting is insane! I almost fell asleep in the middle.\\" \\"More than that, his Japanese is so good it's confusing, Kang Woojin must have learned Korean.\\" \\"Totally accept that it hit 23 million in Japan.\\" The audience, sitting in their seats, enthusiastically shared their reviews. Among them, a man in a long padding coat passed by gracefully. None of them knew he was Kang Woojin. \\"This is definitely going to hit 10 million.\\" Although his face was hidden by a mask, Woojin was smiling. Meanwhile, in LA. Unlike the morning in Korea, it was afternoon in LA. At 'World Disney Pictures', one of the giant film companies, they were busy with 'Beauty and the Beast'. \\"We've received confirmation from all the actresses for the role of 'Bella'.\\" \\"Miley Cara was a close call, but fortunately, she joined.\\" \\"Thought she was rejecting us since there was no response, but did she suddenly change her mind?\\" \\"Well, either way, it's good for us.\\" Several foreigners were speeding up the work process. \\"Now that we've confirmed the male actors for 'Beast' and the female actors for 'Bella', we need to set a date.\\" \\"Should we do it together or separately?\\" \\"There's no rush, right? It might be better to spread it out over weeks.\\" \\"Hmm - we need to check the duet between the two. There's a duet song, and the scene where 'Bella' dances to 'Beast's' piano is important.\\" \\"We'll have to match the actors' voices later.\\" As various issues were rapidly discussed, one executive mused. \\"Before that, we need to make the official announcement for the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast', you all know how noisy the rumors are getting.\\" \\"Hmm - right. If we delay too much, we might lose momentum.\\" Then the first decision was made. \\"Let's handle that matter within a few days.\\" Meanwhile, in Korea, where there were numerous issues including Kang Woojin's 'Best Actor' sweep. \\"[MovieTalk] Kang Woojin's starring 'The Stranger's Bizarre Sacrifice' set to release in Korea!\\" The news of 'The Stranger's' first release in Korea was added. It had been quite noisy since the day before, but on the morning of the release date, the 21st, it was several times more chaotic. \\"Japan's 23 million hit 'The Stranger' starts off strong in Korea! Number one in overall reservation rates\\" It was clearly the Kang Woojin effect. Of course, it was also a blockbuster that hit 23 million in Japan, but the current domestic sensation was largely due to Woojin's first Japanese starring role. With Kang Woojin achieving many milestones this year, the public's expectations were quite high. With such high expectations, disappointment is usually expected, but 'The Stranger' exceeded those expectations with a line of stellar reviews.

This meant that Kang Woojin's dominance in the theaters was becoming even more immense without interruption. The next day, December 22nd. After a day's rest, Kang Woojin, equipped with an even stronger concept, boarded the waiting van. His team members greeted him, and co-pilot Choi Seonggeon immediately showed him the tablet screen. He was grinning. \\"Woojin, 'The Stranger' is doing great!\\" The tablet screen displayed the first-day box office results of 'The Stranger's' release in Korea.

What's the reservation rate?\\" On the 23rd, 'Leech' was also released in Japan. A few days later, in New York. A foreign woman who had just finished recording a famous talk show appeared in the parking lot. It was Miley Cara, wearing a navy coat with her blonde hair flowing down. Fresh from the recording and fully made up, she moved with about a dozen staff members and got into the first of several large vans waiting in the parking lot. -Swish. As soon as she got in, Cara swept her blonde hair back and a female team member handed her a bottle of water. She took a few sips of water, expressing her thanks, and then pulled out her phone. Several messages had arrived. Among them, a message from a Hollywood actor she had met at a recent fashion show event caught her eye. She moved her thumb over his message. It contained a simple one-liner and a link. Cara lightly ignored the comment and tapped the link. Her phone screen changed instantly. It was an article from a major news outlet. Soon after reading the headline, Miley Cara. \\"BBX/'World Disney Pictures' officially announces 'Beauty and the Beast' live-action movie production\\" She smiled faintly. \\"They've officially announced the live-action production.\\""},{"prompt":"386화 압도 (15) ‘삐에로’ 속 ‘헨리 고든’ 또는 강우진이 보는 시야가 변했다. 지금은 끔찍한 ‘삐에로’가 날뛰던 허름한 버스 안이 아니었다. 사람이 북적이는 뉴욕의 어느 곳. 시간은 낮쯤. 그의 과거였다. 우진은 인도를 걷고 있었다. 허나 걸음에 힘이 빠졌다. 그야말로 터덜터덜. 허름한 버스 안에서 보였던 그의 광기 서린 모습은 온데간데없다. 내면이나 외면이나 같았다. 지금의 ‘헨리 고든’은. 아니, 우진의 심정은 뭐랄까- 젖은 행주같이 축축했다. 몸이 무겁고 마음이 흙탕물에 젖었다. 전신에 에너지도 소멸한 느낌이었다. “······후-” 거리를 걸으며 작게 한숨을 내쉬는 강우진. 그를 스치는 수많은 인파 중, 몇몇이 우진을 이상하게 힐끔 쳐다봤다. 모두 멀끔한 정장이나 깔끔한 복장 차림이었다. 강우진도 시선을 눈치챘다. 하지만 신경 쓰지 않았다. -스으. 걷던 우진이 한 마트 앞에 멈춰서는 유리창에 비치는 자신을 바라봤다. 헤진 집업 후드에 청바지, 밑창이 갈릴 대로 갈릴 신발, 부스스한 꽤 긴 머리, 약간 굽은 허리와 어깨, 전체적으로 빼싹 마른 몸집. 이것이 현재 그의 형태였다. 곧, 마트의 문이 열리며 주인으로 보이는 뚱뚱한 남자가 나왔다. 민머리지만 콧수염은 수북했다. 마트 앞 멀뚱히 선 우진을 보자마자 의심 가득한 눈으로 변하더니 그가 미간을 팍 찌푸렸다. “뭐야?” 당황한 우진의 굽은 어깨가 더욱이 움츠러들었다. “아, 아니. 저는.” “됐어, 그냥 가던 길 가.” “오해-” “꺼지라고!” 뚱뚱한 주인의 호통 비슷한 고함에 주변 걷던 사람들이 시선을 돌렸고, 잠시잠깐 어물대던 우진이 가까스로 발길을 옮겼다. 뒤쪽을 힐끔하니 뚱뚱한 주인은 계속 강우진을 노려보고 있었다. 괄시. 이는 분명 강우진의 기분을 상하게 만들었지만, 다시금 길을 걷는 그는 방금의 감정을 무시했다. 자주 있던 일이니까. “그래, 괜찮아. 나만 생각을 지워내면.” 순간, 우진의 속내에 본인의 감정이 적나라하게 울렸다. 무의미였다. 그가 보는 세상도, 그 세상에 존재하는 것도. 아마 저 뒤에 있는 뚱뚱한 남자 역시도. 무성의했다. 터덜터덜 발을 움직이는 강우진의 감정도, 강점도, 단점도, 심정도. 그 어떤 것도 제대로 된 게 없었다. 이쯤 우진은 이루 말할 수 없는 상실감을 느꼈다. 뜨겁거나 차갑지도 않고 희극 쪽도 비극 쪽도 아니었다. 그저 무의미하며 무성의했다. 길을 걷던 우진이 골목길에 들어섰다. 바로 보이는 작은 피자집. 그가 배달일을 하는 곳이었다. 잠시간 굽은 허리의 우진이 피자집을 바라보다가 한숨 쉬며 문을 열었다. 동시에. “어이!!” 피자집 안 주방에서 호통이 울렸다. 밀가루 묻힌 앞치마를 맨 덩치 좋은 남자가 우진을 보자마자 성질을 부렸다. 피자집 사장이었다. “손님한테 전화 받았다!! 7분이나 늦었다며?? 일을 왜 그따위로 하는 거야!!” “죄죄, 죄송합니다!” 기세에 눌린 우진이 바로 사죄했지만, 피자집 사장은 전혀 봐줄 생각이 없는 듯 강우진의 앞에 서선 씩씩거렸다. “피자값은?” “못······받았습니다.” “미치겠군.” “그···게 주문한 손님이 주소를 잘 못 알려줘서.” “뭐야? 손님 탓을 하는 건가? 잘 했다는 거야?” “아니요, 죄송합니다.” 우진을 죽일 듯이 노려보던 피자집 사장이 어금니를 물었다. “빌어먹을 자식이, 하도 빌어대서 일을 시켜줬더니만 내가 미쳤지. 됐어, 나가.” “예?” “나가라고.” “가, 갑자기 그러시면!” “꺼지라고!!” 뾰족한 멸시가 괴성으로 퍼졌다. 우진은 참았다. 어깨와 등이 굽었지만 최선을 다해 피자집 사장에게 매달렸다. 어찌나 필사적인지 말까지 더듬었다. “죄죄죄송합니다! 다, 다시는 이런 일 없게 정말 열심히!” “말로 할 때 갈래, 아니면 어디 하나 부러지고 나서 꺼질래?” “······” 희망이 방금 꺼졌다. 우진은 이 피자집에서 일하는 것으로 근근이 먹고 살고 있었으니까. 작아질 대로 작아진 그가 어렵사리 다시 말했다. “···그럼 지금까지 일한 돈이라도-” -팍! 피자집 사장이 지폐 몇 장과 동전을 집어 던졌다. 물론, 한참 부족했다. “네가 실수한 것들이랑 오늘처럼 못 받은 돈은 차감이다! 냉큼 꺼져!” 발치에 나뒹구는 돈들을 내려보던 우진이 천천히 손을 뻗었다. 자존심은 줍지 말라고 말한다. 자존감이 바닥을 친다. 하지만 이성과 현실이 정정해준다. 자존심이나 자존감이 돈을 주진 않는다. 바닥에 손을 뻗었을 땐 짜증이 치밀었으나, 나뒹구는 지폐를 집자마자 크나큰 허무가 번졌다. ‘그래. 이게 맞겠지.’ 참는다. 우진은 만연만 잠잠한 핍박을 언제나 그렇듯 받아들였다. 돈을 다 주운 그가 피자집을 나섰다. 뒤쪽에서 피자집 사장이 바닥에 침을 퉤 뱉는 소리가 들렸다. 모른척했다. 강우진이 다시 걷는다. 몇 걸음 걷다 보니 여러 TV가 걸린 가게가 보였다. TV 속 정장 입은 여자가 멘트치고 있었다. -[“화를 참으세요, 무분별하게 화가 폭발하는 것은 병입니다. 치료받아야 하죠. 화는 많은 문제의 근원이 됩니다.”] 멋들어진 정장을 입은 여자는 심리 쪽의 전문가 같았다. 그리고 마치 지금의 우진에게, ‘헨리 고든’에게 전하는 말처럼 들렸다. 상실감이 가득한 우진이 다시 걸으며 혼잣말을 뱉었다. “맞아, 화를 냈다면 돈을 얻진 못했겠지.” 갑자기 비가 부슬부슬 내렸다. 우산 없는 거리의 사람들이 뛰었다. 하지만 우진은. “······” 헤진 후드를 머리에 쓸 뿐이었다. 횡당보도에 선 그의 앞으로 버스 한 대가 섰다. 창문에 보이는 어린아이. 환하게 웃는다. 아이를 따라 우진도 억지웃음을 지어 보였다. 오래가지 못했다. 엄마가 손으로 아이의 눈을 가렸으니까. 금세 우진의 얼굴엔 웃음기가 사라졌다. 반복된 과도한 편견에 적응했기 때문이었다. 머릿속에 여러 단어들이 요동쳤다. 참아라, 감내해라, 무시해라, 넘겨라, 눈을 감아라. 화를 억눌러라. “일을······구해야 돼.” 집에는 정신이 온전치 못한 여동생이 기다리고 있다. 쉴 시간은 없었다. 이내 답답함이 피어올랐다. 빗줄기가 거세졌다. -사아! 강우진이 눈앞에 보이는 쓰레기통의 신문을 집었다. 그것으로 머리를 가리려다 멈칫. 신문 1면에 보이는 헤드라인 때문이었다. 『행방이 묘연했던 은행털이범들, 정신 잃은 채 경찰서 앞에 버려진 채 발견! 숨겨진 히어로 누구인가?』 ‘숨겨진 히어로’. 최근 이런 기사가 자주 보였다. 곧, 작게 콧방귀 낀 우진이 신문을 쓰레기통에 버렸다. 히어로. 듣기엔 좋다. 하지만 히어로도 빌런이 있어야 존재하는 거잖아? 생각해보면 오늘 강우진이 만난 빌런들만 몇 명인가? 하지만 우진은 그 누구도 척결하지 못했다. 왜일까? 그가 집에 도착했다. 좁디좁은 방 한 칸과 화장실이 전부인 곳. 헤진 침대에 여동생이 자고 있다. 이불을 덮어준 우진이 화장실에 들어갔다. 그가 거울을 본다. “······” 다시 웃어본다. 그런데 왜인지 화가 치밀어 올랐다. 표정은 웃는데 가슴에 불이 차올랐다. 난 아무것도 안 했다고. 그런데 왜? 왜 나한테만? 종일 본인이 세상에 보인 친절은 살기 위한 방어기제였다. 우진이 주먹을 말아 쥐었다. 화가 터질 뻔한 그는 주먹으로 거울을 깨버리려 했다. 그러나 역시 참았다. 대신. -팍! 비누를 바닥에 집어 던졌다. 한계였다. 뒤로 며칠 뒤. 강우진의 시야가 또 한 번 변했다. 지금의 그는 한 대형마트의 광고판을 들고 주차장 입구에서 방방 뛰고 있었다. 새로운 일을 구한 것. 다만, 행색과 복장이 특이했다. 옅게 벌건 머리, 하얗게 칠해진 얼굴, 뾰족하면서도 빨간 사각형이 그려진 두 눈, 마찬가지로 쭉 찢어진 웃음처럼 발린 두터운 입술. 옷도 광대 그 자체. 광고판을 잡아 흔드는 ‘삐에로’. 한창 그가 흔들고 있을 때 뒤에서 익숙한 남자 목소리가 들렸다. “어이- 헨리.” ‘삐에로’인 ‘헨리 고든’ 또는 강우진이 고개를 돌렸다. 덩치 좋은 남자가 낄낄대고 있다. 그만둔 피자집의 사장이었다. “크크, 맞네? 어이 헨리. 허리까지 약간 굽어서 그런지 지금 모습 잘 어울리는걸?” “······” “아니, 삐쩍 말라서 그런가? 춤춰 봐, 춤. ‘삐에로’는 고객에게 감동을 줘야지.” 괄시, 핍박, 차별, 편견, 멸시. 어쩌면 그 이상. 강우진에게 악취 나는 것들이 소용돌이쳤다. 화가 치민다. 그런데 뭘 어떡해야 하지? 결국, 우진은 멍청하게 서 있었다. 피자집 사장은 몇 분간 낄낄 대가가 마트 방향으로 사라졌다. 광고판을 내린 ‘삐에로’는 그의 뒷모습을 바라볼 뿐이었다. “······” 표정이 묘했다. 그리고 비가 쏟아지는 밤. 피자집 안의 덩치 좋은 사장은 홀로 TV를 보며 맥주를 마시고 있었다. 장사를 마무리한 뒤인 듯. -쿠구구궁! 빗소리에 천둥이 섞였다. 이때 피자집 문이 끼익하고 열렸다. 약간 놀란 피자집 사장이 얼굴을 돌렸다. 비에 젖은 괴한이. 아니, ‘삐에로’가 서 있었다. 보자마자 ‘삐에로’가 누군지 단박에 알아챈 피자집 사장이 벌떡 일어나 외쳤다. “헨리?! 너 이 자식 여긴 왜!” 동시에 치는 천둥 번개. -쿠구구궁! 그 소리에 묻히는 총성. -탕탕! ‘삐에로’ 또는 강우진은 서 있었다. 한 손엔 총. 바닥엔 피자집 사장이 널브러져 있다. 핏물이 조금씩 바닥에 번진다. 이 순간. “······아.” 강우진은 후회했다. 더불어 참았던 화가 단번에 뻥 하고 분출됨을 느꼈고, 묘하게도 굽었던 어깨가 쫙 펴졌다. 허리도 그랬다. 이때 번쩍했다. 밖에서 친 번개 덕에 컴컴한 ‘삐에로’의 얼굴이 잘 보였다. 여전히 ‘삐에로’다운 얼굴이지만, 빗물 덕에 눈 쪽에 빨간색이 줄줄 흘러내리고 있었다. 언뜻 벌건 피눈물을 흘리며 오열하는 것 같은 얼굴. 강우진이 웃었다. “크크크! 하하하! 하하하하하!” 억지가 아니다. 그러다 우진의 눈에 뭔가가 띄었다. 피자집 사장이 쓰러지며 바닥에 나뒹구는 물건 중 하나였다. 여러 카드 중 한 장. 핏물이 묻은 카드를 집어 드는 강우진. “음-” 카드엔 광대 또는 ‘삐에로’가 그려져 있었다. -‘JOKER(조커)’ 얼마나 지났나? ‘삐에로’ 속 ‘헨리 고든’의 세상을 살던 강우진은 어느새 현실로, 밴의 안으로 돌아온 상태였다. 창밖은 여전히 눈이 펑펑 내리고 있었다. 역시나 우진이 아공간에 진입하는 순간과 변한 건 전혀 없다. 하지만. ‘후- 약간 뻐근한가?’ 질펀한 생을 살다 온 우진은 기상천외한 것들을 직접 경험했고 행했다. 아니, 빌런으로서 ‘탄생기’를 겪었다고 해야 하나? 컨셉질이 아니었다면 아마 우진은 지금 입이 찢어져라 웃었을지 몰랐다. 광대의, ‘삐에로’의 잔향이 남아서였다. 하지만 우진은 아공간 베테랑답게 베었던 광분을, 광기를 지워냈다. 그리곤 포커페이스를 유지하면서도 무릎에 올려진 ‘삐에로’ 시나리오를 내려봤다. ‘이건 뭐랄까- 시나리오도 재밌는데, 직접 리딩(경험)하는 건 차원이 다르달까?’ 시나리오 자체에 숱한 감정이 숨겨져 있고, 대사나 지문에 ‘서브 텍스트’가 지천에 널렸기 때문. 서브 텍스트는 작가나 각본가가 남몰래 숨겨둔 지뢰 같은 거였다. 대사 또는 지문 등의 진짜 속뜻이 내포된 느낌. 주인공인 ‘헨리 고든’ 자체도 특이했다. 초반에 유약하며 자존감이 낮고 약자의 표본인 그지만, 속내에 쌓이는 분노와 화는 그 어떤 누구보다 강렬하다. 하지만 뒤로 갈수록 광기과 쾌락이 만연해지는 ‘헨리 고든’에겐 화나 분노가 없다. 그런 ‘헨리 고든’을 몇 번이나 리딩(경험)한 우진은 생각했다. ‘‘배역의 자유도’나 ‘배역 합성’- ‘야수화’도 쓸 수 있을 거 같고.’ ‘삐에로’ 속 빌런을 현실에 풀어 놓는 걸 말이다. ‘또는 다른 능력들도. 흠, 재밌겠네.’ 물론, 업그레이드된 상태로. 한편, LA. 한국은 아침이지만 LA는 오후였다. 한국보다 몇 배는 더 시끌벅적한 헐리웃 중, ‘삐에로’로 핫한 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 한 중형 회의실에 안가복 감독과 통역, 반대편엔 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 간부들이 앉아 있었다. 총 4명. 안가복 감독은 가까운 세트 또는 스테이지에서 일을 보다가 갑자기 호출을 받았다. 그렇기에. ‘뭐지. 표정들이 좀- 진지하군.’ 건너편 민머리 포함, 영화 ‘삐에로’에 관여도가 높은 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 간부들 표정을 살폈다. 짐짓 진중했다. 마치 비밀회담 같기도 했다. 이쯤이었다. “감독님.” 대화하던 간부 중 민머리 남자가 안가복 감독에게 투명 파일을 내밀었다. “알아두셔야 할 게 있습니다.” “······” ‘삐에로’의 감독 안가복은 별말 없이 건네진 투명 파일을 집었다. 동시에 민머리 간부가 말했다. “‘삐에로’는 개봉 전에 타이틀에 변화가 있을 겁니다.” “···타이틀이?” “네. 비슷하지만 조금 다르죠. 보시면 알겠지만, ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’으로 바뀔 겁니다.” ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’이란 새로운 제목을 읊조리던 민머리 간부가. “그리고 영화 ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’은 우리가 극비로 기획 중인, 꽤 예전부터 준비해오던 대형 프로젝트의 시작점 영화입니다. 여러 영화들이 유기적으로 연결된 히어로 시리즈. 즉, 시네마틱 유니버스. ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’의 남주 ‘헨리 고든’은.” 덤덤하며 확고히 말을 이었다. “우리의 시네마틱 유니버스를 세상에 알릴 첫 빌런 캐릭터가 될 겁니다.”","completion":"Episode 386: Overwhelming (15) The perspective of 'Henry Gordon' or Kang Woojin within 'Pierrot' had changed. He was no longer inside the shabby bus where the terrible 'Pierrot' had run amok. It was somewhere in bustling New York during the day. It was his past. Woojin was walking on the sidewalk, but his steps lacked energy. Truly trudging along. The crazed look he had on the bus was gone. Both his inner and outer selves were the same. The current 'Henry Gordon', or rather, Woojin's mood was like a wet rag—damp. His body felt heavy, his heart muddied. It was as if all the energy in his body had dissipated. \\"......Sigh.\\" Walking down the street, Kang Woojin let out a small sigh. Among the many people passing by, a few glanced at Woojin strangely. They were all dressed in neat suits or clean outfits. Woojin noticed their gazes but didn't care. -Swish. Walking Woojin stopped in front of a mart and looked at his reflection in the window. Worn zip-up hoodie, jeans, shoes with soles about to split, quite long and unkempt hair, slightly hunched back and shoulders, overall a very lean figure. This was his current state. Soon, the door of the mart opened, and a fat man who seemed to be the owner came out. Bald, but with a thick mustache. As soon as he saw Woojin standing dumbly in front of the mart, his eyes filled with suspicion, and he furrowed his brow. \\"What do you want?\\" Woojin's already hunched shoulders shrank even more in surprise. \\"No, I'm just...\\" \\"Never mind, just go on your way.\\" \\"But you misunderstand—\\" \\"Get lost!\\" The fat owner's shout, akin to a roar, drew the attention of passersby, and Woojin, who had been hesitating, finally moved on. Glancing back, the fat owner was still glaring at him. Contempt. This clearly upset Kang Woojin, but as he walked on, he ignored the recent emotions. It was a common occurrence, after all. \\"It's fine, as long as I can erase my thoughts.\\" Suddenly, Woojin's inner feelings resonated starkly. Everything was meaningless. The world he saw, everything that existed in it, and probably the fat man behind him too. It was all insincere. Trudging along, Woojin's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and feelings—nothing was right. At this point, Woojin felt an indescribable sense of loss. It was neither hot nor cold, neither comedic nor tragic. It was just meaningless and insincere. Woojin entered an alleyway. A small pizza shop came into view. It was where he worked delivering pizzas. For a moment, the hunched Woojin looked at the pizza shop, sighed, and opened the door. At the same time. \\"Hey!!\\" A shout came from the kitchen inside the pizza shop. A burly man wearing a flour-covered apron scolded Woojin as soon as he saw him. It was the pizza shop owner. \\"I got a call from a customer!! You were 7 minutes late?? Why do you work like that!!\\" \\"I'm sorry, so sorry!\\" Woojin immediately apologized, overwhelmed by the owner's fury, but the pizza shop owner stood in front of him, fuming, with no intention of letting it slide. \\"What about the pizza money?\\" \\"I couldn't... collect it.\\" \\"I'm going crazy.\\" \\"That... the customer gave the wrong address.\\" \\"What? Are you blaming the customer? Are you saying you did a good job?\\" \\"No, I'm sorry.\\" The pizza shop owner, glaring at Woojin as if he wanted to kill him, gritted his teeth. \\"Damn it, I gave you a job because you begged so much, but I must have been crazy. Get out.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Get out, I said.\\" \\"But if you suddenly do this!\\" \\"Get lost!!\\" Sharp contempt spread like a scream. Woojin held back. His shoulders and back were hunched, but he desperately clung to the pizza shop owner, stuttering his words. \\"I'm so sorry! I'll really work hard so this never happens again!\\" \\"Do you want to leave now, or do you want to get hurt and then leave?\\" \\"......\\" Hope had just been extinguished. Woojin had been barely making a living by working at this pizza shop. The diminished Woojin spoke with difficulty. \\"Then, at least the money I've earned so far—\\" -Whack! The pizza shop owner threw a few bills and coins. Of course, it was far from enough. \\"I've deducted the mistakes you made and the money you didn't collect today! Get out now!\\" Woojin looked down at the money scattered at his feet and slowly reached out his hand. His pride told him not to pick it up. His self-esteem hit rock bottom. But reason and reality corrected him. Pride and self-esteem don't give money. As he reached for the ground, irritation surged, but as soon as he picked up the bills, a great emptiness spread. \\"Yeah. This must be right.\\" He endured. Woojin, as always, accepted the pervasive and quiet oppression. After picking up all the money, he left the pizza shop. The sound of the pizza shop owner spitting on the floor could be heard from behind. Woojin ignored it. Kang Woojin walked again. After a few steps, he saw a store with several TVs on display. A woman in a suit on TV was making a statement. -[\\"Control your anger, uncontrolled outbursts of anger are a sickness. You need to get treated. Anger is the root of many problems.\\"] The woman in the stylish suit seemed to be an expert in psychology. And it sounded as if she was speaking directly to the current Woojin, to 'Henry Gordon'. Woojin, filled with a sense of loss, walked on and muttered to himself. \\"That's right, if I had gotten angry, I wouldn't have gotten any money.\\" Suddenly, it began to drizzle. People on the street without umbrellas started running. But Woojin. \\"......\\" Just pulled his worn hoodie over his head. A bus stopped in front of him at the crosswalk. A child in the window was smiling brightly. Woojin forced a smile in response. It didn't last long. The mother covered the child's eyes with her hand. The smile quickly faded from Woojin's face. He had become accustomed to repeated excessive prejudice. Various words swirled in his head. Endure, bear it, ignore it, let it go, close your eyes. Suppress the anger. \\"I need to... find a job.\\" His mentally unstable younger sister was waiting at home. There was no time to rest. Soon, frustration welled up. The rain grew heavier. -Pour! Kang Woojin picked up a newspaper from a trash can in front of him. He was about to cover his head with it when he hesitated. It was because of the headline on the front page of the newspaper. \\"Bank robbers, whose whereabouts were unknown, found unconscious in front of the police station! Who is the hidden hero?\\" 'Hidden hero'. Such articles had been appearing frequently lately. Soon, Woojin, who had snorted at the article, threw the newspaper back into the trash can. Hero. It sounds good. But heroes only exist because there are villains, right? Thinking about it, how many villains had Kang Woojin encountered today? But Woojin hadn't been able to defeat any of them. Why? He had arrived home. A tiny room with just one space and a bathroom. His sister was sleeping on a worn bed. After covering her with a blanket, Woojin went into the bathroom. He looked in the mirror. \\"......\\" He tried to smile again. But for some reason, anger surged within him. His face was smiling, but his heart was burning with rage. I didn't do anything. But why? Why only me? The kindness he had shown to the world all day was a defense mechanism for survival. Woojin clenched his fist. He was about to break the mirror with his fist, overwhelmed with anger, but he held back. Instead. -Whack! He threw a bar of soap to the floor. He had reached his limit. A few days later. Kang Woojin's perspective changed once again. Now he was jumping around at the entrance of a large supermarket, holding an advertising sign. He had found a new job. However, his appearance and outfit were peculiar. Lightly reddened hair, a face painted white, red squares drawn around his eyes, and thick lips painted like a stretched smile. His clothes were that of a clown. The 'Pierrot' shaking the advertising sign. While he was busy shaking it, a familiar male voice came from behind. \\"Hey— Henry.\\" The 'Pierrot', or Henry Gordon, or Kang Woojin, turned his head. A burly man was chuckling. It was the owner of the pizza shop he had quit. \\"Ha, it's really you? Hey Henry. You're slightly hunched, so you really suit this look, don't you?\\" \\"......\\" \\"Or is it because you're so skinny? Dance, dance. A 'Pierrot' should move the customers.\\" Contempt, oppression, discrimination, prejudice, disdain. Perhaps even more than that. All these foul things swirled around Kang Woojin. Anger was rising. But what could he do? In the end, Woojin just stood there stupidly. The pizza shop owner chuckled for a few minutes and then disappeared in the direction of the supermarket. The 'Pierrot' just watched his back. \\"......\\" His expression was complex. And on a rainy night. The burly pizza shop owner was alone, drinking beer and watching TV after closing up shop. -Rumble! The sound of rain was mixed with thunder. At that moment, the door of the pizza shop creaked open. The pizza shop owner turned his head, slightly startled. A drenched figure stood there. No, it was the 'Pierrot'. As soon as he saw him, the pizza shop owner, who immediately recognized who the 'Pierrot' was, jumped up and shouted. \\"Henry?! What the hell are you doing here!\\" At the same time, thunder and lightning struck. -Rumble! The sound of gunfire was drowned out by the thunder. -Tang tang! The 'Pierrot', or Kang Woojin, stood there with a gun in hand. The pizza shop owner lay sprawled on the floor, blood slowly spreading. At that moment. \\"......Ah.\\" Kang Woojin regretted it. He also felt the anger he had been holding back suddenly burst forth, and strangely, his hunched shoulders straightened. So did his back. Then there was a flash. The face of the 'Pierrot' was visible in the dark due to the lightning outside. Still a 'Pierrot' face, but the red around the eyes was running down with the rainwater. It looked like a face crying bloody tears. Kang Woojin laughed. \\"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!\\" It wasn't forced. Then something caught Woojin's eye. It was one of the items that had fallen to the floor when the pizza shop owner collapsed. One of several cards. Kang Woojin picked up the card stained with blood. \\"Hmm—\\" On the card was a drawing of a clown or 'Pierrot'. -'JOKER' How much time had passed? The 'Pierrot', or Henry Gordon, who had been living in the world of 'Pierrot', had now returned to reality, inside the van. Outside the window, it was still snowing heavily. As always, nothing had changed when Woojin entered the pocket dimension. But. \\"Huh— A bit stiff?\\" Having lived a sordid life, Woojin had directly experienced and performed extraordinary things. Or should it be said that he had gone through a 'villain's origin' story? If it weren't for the concept, Woojin might have laughed his head off right now. It was because the aftertaste of the clown, the 'Pierrot', remained. However, Woojin, being a veteran of the pocket dimension, erased the frenzy and madness he had experienced. He maintained a poker face while looking down at the 'Pierrot' script on his lap. \\"What should I say— the script is interesting, but experiencing it directly is on another level?\\" The script itself was filled with countless emotions, and the dialogue and stage directions were littered with 'subtext'. Subtext was like a mine hidden by the writer or screenwriter. It was the real meaning embedded in the dialogue or stage directions. The protagonist 'Henry Gordon' was also unique. Initially weak, with low self-esteem, and a model of the underdog, the anger and rage building inside him were more intense than anyone else's. But as the story progresses, 'Henry Gordon', who becomes filled with madness and pleasure, has no anger or rage. Having read (experienced) 'Henry Gordon' several times, Woojin thought. 'I could use 'freedom of character' or 'character synthesis'— even 'beastification'.' He was talking about releasing the villain within 'Pierrot' into reality. 'Or other abilities too. Hmm, that could be fun.' Of course, in an upgraded state. Meanwhile, in LA. It was morning in Korea, but afternoon in LA. In the bustling Hollywood, much noisier than Korea, a medium-sized conference room at 'Columbia Studio', which was hot with 'Pierrot', was occupied by Director An Gabok, an interpreter, and executives from 'Columbia Studio'. A total of four people. Director An Gabok had been called in suddenly from a nearby set or stage. Therefore. 'What's this? Their expressions are a bit— serious.' He observed the expressions of the executives from 'Columbia Studio', including the bald man, who were highly involved in the movie 'Pierrot'. They were seriously solemn. It almost felt like a secret meeting. At this point. \\"Director.\\" One of the executives, the bald man, handed An Gabok a transparent file. \\"There's something you need to know.\\" \\"......\\" Director An Gabok of 'Pierrot' silently took the transparent file handed to him. At the same time, the bald executive said. \\"'Pierrot' will undergo a title change before its release.\\" \\"...The title?\\" \\"Yes. Similar, but a bit different. As you'll see, it will change to 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'.\\" The bald executive, who recited the new title 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', continued. \\"Furthermore, the movie 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' will be the starting point of a top-secret, large-scale project we've been planning for quite some time. A series of movies organically connected in a hero series. In other words, a cinematic universe. The male lead of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', 'Henry Gordon', will be.\\" He spoke calmly and firmly. \\"The first villain character to announce our cinematic universe to the world.\\""},{"prompt":"Traduit moi ce qui suit en anglais : salut mon nom est Isaac kongolo j'aimerais vous parler de mes activités.","completion":"Hello, my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I would like to talk to you about my activities."},{"prompt":"Comment se traduit greeting en français","completion":"Le mot \\"greeting\\" en français se traduit par \\"salutation\\"."},{"prompt":"• Mi a szekvenciális hálózat és miben különbözik a kombinációs hálózattól?

TV 속 정장 입은 여자가 멘트치고 있었다. -[“화를 참으세요, 무분별하게 화가 폭발하는 것은 병입니다. 치료받아야 하죠. 화는 많은 문제의 근원이 됩니다.”] 멋들어진 정장을 입은 여자는 심리 쪽의 전문가 같았다. 그리고 마치 지금의 우진에게, ‘헨리 고든’에게 전하는 말처럼 들렸다. 상실감이 가득한 우진이 다시 걸으며 혼잣말을 뱉었다. “맞아, 화를 냈다면 돈을 얻진 못했겠지.” 갑자기 비가 부슬부슬 내렸다. 우산 없는 거리의 사람들이 뛰었다. 하지만 우진은. “······” 헤진 후드를 머리에 쓸 뿐이었다. 횡당보도에 선 그의 앞으로 버스 한 대가 섰다. 창문에 보이는 어린아이. 환하게 웃는다. 아이를 따라 우진도 억지웃음을 지어 보였다. 오래가지 못했다. 엄마가 손으로 아이의 눈을 가렸으니까. 금세 우진의 얼굴엔 웃음기가 사라졌다. 반복된 과도한 편견에 적응했기 때문이었다. 머릿속에 여러 단어들이 요동쳤다. 참아라, 감내해라, 무시해라, 넘겨라, 눈을 감아라. 화를 억눌러라. “일을······구해야 돼.” 집에는 정신이 온전치 못한 여동생이 기다리고 있다. 쉴 시간은 없었다. 이내 답답함이 피어올랐다. 빗줄기가 거세졌다. -사아! 강우진이 눈앞에 보이는 쓰레기통의 신문을 집었다. 그것으로 머리를 가리려다 멈칫. 신문 1면에 보이는 헤드라인 때문이었다. 『행방이 묘연했던 은행털이범들, 정신 잃은 채 경찰서 앞에 버려진 채 발견! 숨겨진 히어로 누구인가?』 ‘숨겨진 히어로’. 최근 이런 기사가 자주 보였다. 곧, 작게 콧방귀 낀 우진이 신문을 쓰레기통에 버렸다. 히어로. 듣기엔 좋다. 하지만 히어로도 빌런이 있어야 존재하는 거잖아? 생각해보면 오늘 강우진이 만난 빌런들만 몇 명인가? 하지만 우진은 그 누구도 척결하지 못했다. 왜일까? 그가 집에 도착했다. 좁디좁은 방 한 칸과 화장실이 전부인 곳. 헤진 침대에 여동생이 자고 있다. 이불을 덮어준 우진이 화장실에 들어갔다. 그가 거울을 본다. “······” 다시 웃어본다. 그런데 왜인지 화가 치밀어 올랐다. 표정은 웃는데 가슴에 불이 차올랐다. 난 아무것도 안 했다고. 그런데 왜? 왜 나한테만? 종일 본인이 세상에 보인 친절은 살기 위한 방어기제였다. 우진이 주먹을 말아 쥐었다. 화가 터질 뻔한 그는 주먹으로 거울을 깨버리려 했다. 그러나 역시 참았다. 대신. -팍! 비누를 바닥에 집어 던졌다. 한계였다. 뒤로 며칠 뒤. 강우진의 시야가 또 한 번 변했다. 지금의 그는 한 대형마트의 광고판을 들고 주차장 입구에서 방방 뛰고 있었다. 새로운 일을 구한 것. 다만, 행색과 복장이 특이했다. 옅게 벌건 머리, 하얗게 칠해진 얼굴, 뾰족하면서도 빨간 사각형이 그려진 두 눈, 마찬가지로 쭉 찢어진 웃음처럼 발린 두터운 입술. 옷도 광대 그 자체. 광고판을 잡아 흔드는 ‘삐에로’. 한창 그가 흔들고 있을 때 뒤에서 익숙한 남자 목소리가 들렸다. “어이- 헨리.” ‘삐에로’인 ‘헨리 고든’ 또는 강우진이 고개를 돌렸다. 덩치 좋은 남자가 낄낄대고 있다. 그만둔 피자집의 사장이었다. “크크, 맞네? 어이 헨리. 허리까지 약간 굽어서 그런지 지금 모습 잘 어울리는걸?” “······” “아니, 삐쩍 말라서 그런가? 춤춰 봐, 춤. ‘삐에로’는 고객에게 감동을 줘야지.” 괄시, 핍박, 차별, 편견, 멸시. 어쩌면 그 이상. 강우진에게 악취 나는 것들이 소용돌이쳤다. 화가 치민다. 그런데 뭘 어떡해야 하지? 결국, 우진은 멍청하게 서 있었다. 피자집 사장은 몇 분간 낄낄 대가가 마트 방향으로 사라졌다. 광고판을 내린 ‘삐에로’는 그의 뒷모습을 바라볼 뿐이었다. “······” 표정이 묘했다. 그리고 비가 쏟아지는 밤. 피자집 안의 덩치 좋은 사장은 홀로 TV를 보며 맥주를 마시고 있었다. 장사를 마무리한 뒤인 듯. -쿠구구궁! 빗소리에 천둥이 섞였다. 이때 피자집 문이 끼익하고 열렸다. 약간 놀란 피자집 사장이 얼굴을 돌렸다. 비에 젖은 괴한이. 아니, ‘삐에로’가 서 있었다. 보자마자 ‘삐에로’가 누군지 단박에 알아챈 피자집 사장이 벌떡 일어나 외쳤다. “헨리?! 너 이 자식 여긴 왜!” 동시에 치는 천둥 번개. -쿠구구궁! 그 소리에 묻히는 총성. -탕탕! ‘삐에로’ 또는 강우진은 서 있었다. 한 손엔 총. 바닥엔 피자집 사장이 널브러져 있다. 핏물이 조금씩 바닥에 번진다. 이 순간. “······아.” 강우진은 후회했다. 더불어 참았던 화가 단번에 뻥 하고 분출됨을 느꼈고, 묘하게도 굽었던 어깨가 쫙 펴졌다. 허리도 그랬다. 이때 번쩍했다. 밖에서 친 번개 덕에 컴컴한 ‘삐에로’의 얼굴이 잘 보였다. 여전히 ‘삐에로’다운 얼굴이지만, 빗물 덕에 눈 쪽에 빨간색이 줄줄 흘러내리고 있었다. 언뜻 벌건 피눈물을 흘리며 오열하는 것 같은 얼굴. 강우진이 웃었다. “크크크! 하하하! 하하하하하!” 억지가 아니다. 그러다 우진의 눈에 뭔가가 띄었다. 피자집 사장이 쓰러지며 바닥에 나뒹구는 물건 중 하나였다. 여러 카드 중 한 장. 핏물이 묻은 카드를 집어 드는 강우진. “음-” 카드엔 광대 또는 ‘삐에로’가 그려져 있었다. -‘JOKER(조커)’ 얼마나 지났나? ‘삐에로’ 속 ‘헨리 고든’의 세상을 살던 강우진은 어느새 현실로, 밴의 안으로 돌아온 상태였다. 창밖은 여전히 눈이 펑펑 내리고 있었다. 역시나 우진이 아공간에 진입하는 순간과 변한 건 전혀 없다. 하지만. ‘후- 약간 뻐근한가?’ 질펀한 생을 살다 온 우진은 기상천외한 것들을 직접 경험했고 행했다. 아니, 빌런으로서 ‘탄생기’를 겪었다고 해야 하나? 컨셉질이 아니었다면 아마 우진은 지금 입이 찢어져라 웃었을지 몰랐다. 광대의, ‘삐에로’의 잔향이 남아서였다. 하지만 우진은 아공간 베테랑답게 베었던 광분을, 광기를 지워냈다. 그리곤 포커페이스를 유지하면서도 무릎에 올려진 ‘삐에로’ 시나리오를 내려봤다. ‘이건 뭐랄까- 시나리오도 재밌는데, 직접 리딩(경험)하는 건 차원이 다르달까?’ 시나리오 자체에 숱한 감정이 숨겨져 있고, 대사나 지문에 ‘서브 텍스트’가 지천에 널렸기 때문. 서브 텍스트는 작가나 각본가가 남몰래 숨겨둔 지뢰 같은 거였다. 대사 또는 지문 등의 진짜 속뜻이 내포된 느낌. 주인공인 ‘헨리 고든’ 자체도 특이했다. 초반에 유약하며 자존감이 낮고 약자의 표본인 그지만, 속내에 쌓이는 분노와 화는 그 어떤 누구보다 강렬하다. 하지만 뒤로 갈수록 광기과 쾌락이 만연해지는 ‘헨리 고든’에겐 화나 분노가 없다. 그런 ‘헨리 고든’을 몇 번이나 리딩(경험)한 우진은 생각했다. ‘‘배역의 자유도’나 ‘배역 합성’- ‘야수화’도 쓸 수 있을 거 같고.’ ‘삐에로’ 속 빌런을 현실에 풀어 놓는 걸 말이다. ‘또는 다른 능력들도. 흠, 재밌겠네.’ 물론, 업그레이드된 상태로. 한편, LA. 한국은 아침이지만 LA는 오후였다. 한국보다 몇 배는 더 시끌벅적한 헐리웃 중, ‘삐에로’로 핫한 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 한 중형 회의실에 안가복 감독과 통역, 반대편엔 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 간부들이 앉아 있었다. 총 4명. 안가복 감독은 가까운 세트 또는 스테이지에서 일을 보다가 갑자기 호출을 받았다. 그렇기에. ‘뭐지. 표정들이 좀- 진지하군.’ 건너편 민머리 포함, 영화 ‘삐에로’에 관여도가 높은 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 간부들 표정을 살폈다. 짐짓 진중했다. 마치 비밀회담 같기도 했다. 이쯤이었다. “감독님.” 대화하던 간부 중 민머리 남자가 안가복 감독에게 투명 파일을 내밀었다. “알아두셔야 할 게 있습니다.” “······” ‘삐에로’의 감독 안가복은 별말 없이 건네진 투명 파일을 집었다. 동시에 민머리 간부가 말했다. “‘삐에로’는 개봉 전에 타이틀에 변화가 있을 겁니다.” “···타이틀이?” “네. 비슷하지만 조금 다르죠. 보시면 알겠지만, ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’으로 바뀔 겁니다.” ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’이란 새로운 제목을 읊조리던 민머리 간부가. “그리고 영화 ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’은 우리가 극비로 기획 중인, 꽤 예전부터 준비해오던 대형 프로젝트의 시작점 영화입니다. 여러 영화들이 유기적으로 연결된 히어로 시리즈. 즉, 시네마틱 유니버스. ‘삐에로: 빌런의 탄생’의 남주 ‘헨리 고든’은.” 덤덤하며 확고히 말을 이었다. “우리의 시네마틱 유니버스를 세상에 알릴 첫 빌런 캐릭터가 될 겁니다.”","completion":"Episode 386: Overwhelming (15) The perspective of 'Henry Gordon' inside 'Pierrot,' or as seen by Kang Woojin, had changed. It was no longer the shabby bus where the terrible 'Pierrot' had run amok. It was somewhere in bustling New York. It was daytime. It was his past. Woojin was walking on the sidewalk, but his steps lacked strength. Truly trudging along. The crazed appearance he had shown inside the shabby bus was nowhere to be found. Both his inner and outer selves were the same. The current 'Henry Gordon' was... No, Woojin's feelings were like a wet rag, damp and heavy. His body felt heavy, and his heart felt soaked in muddy water. It felt as if all the energy in his body had dissipated. \\"······Sigh.\\" Kang Woojin let out a small sigh as he walked down the street. Among the many people passing by, a few glanced at Woojin strangely. They were all dressed in neat suits or clean outfits. Woojin noticed their stares but didn't care. -Swish. As Woojin walked, he stopped in front of a mart and looked at his reflection in the glass window. Worn zip-up hoodie, jeans, shoes with soles worn down to the brink, quite long and unkempt hair, slightly hunched back and shoulders, overall a very lean figure. This was his current state. Soon, the door of the mart opened, and a fat man who seemed to be the owner came out. He was bald but had a thick mustache. As soon as he saw Woojin standing dumbly in front of the mart, his eyes filled with suspicion, and he furrowed his brow. \\"What do you want?\\" Woojin's already hunched shoulders shrank even more. \\"Ah, no. I'm just...\\" \\"Never mind, just go on your way.\\" \\"But you misunderstand-\\" \\"Get lost!\\" The fat owner's shout, similar to a roar, made the people walking by turn their heads, and Woojin, who had been hesitating for a moment, finally moved on. Glancing back, the fat owner was still glaring at Kang Woojin. Contempt. This certainly hurt Kang Woojin's feelings, but as he walked on, he ignored the recent emotions. It was a common occurrence, after all. \\"Yeah, it's okay. As long as I can erase my thoughts.\\" Suddenly, Woojin's innermost feelings resonated starkly. It was meaningless. The world he saw, everything that existed in it, and probably even the fat man behind him. It was insincere. Kang Woojin's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and feelings as he trudged along were all inadequate. At this point, Woojin felt an indescribable sense of loss. It was neither hot nor cold, neither comedic nor tragic. It was just meaningless and insincere. Woojin entered an alleyway. A small pizza shop came into view. It was where he worked as a delivery man. For a moment, Woojin, with his hunched back, looked at the pizza shop, then sighed and opened the door. At the same time. \\"Hey!!\\" A shout came from the kitchen inside the pizza shop. A burly man wearing an apron covered in flour saw Woojin and immediately lost his temper. He was the owner of the pizza shop. \\"I got a call from a customer!! You were 7 minutes late, huh?? Why do you work like that!!\\" \\"I'm sorry, so sorry!\\" Woojin immediately apologized, subdued by the owner's presence, but the pizza shop owner showed no signs of forgiving him as he stood in front of Kang Woojin, fuming. \\"What about the pizza money?\\" \\"I couldn't... collect it.\\" \\"I'm going crazy.\\" \\"That... The customer gave the wrong address.\\" \\"What? Are you blaming the customer? Are you saying you did a good job?\\" \\"No, I'm sorry.\\" The pizza shop owner, glaring at Woojin as if he wanted to kill him, gritted his teeth. \\"Damn it, I was crazy to give you a job because you begged so much. That's it, get out.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Get out, I said.\\" \\"But, if you suddenly do this!\\" \\"Get lost!!\\" A sharp contempt spread like a scream. Woojin held back. His shoulders and back were hunched, but he clung to the pizza shop owner as desperately as he could, even stuttering his words. \\"I'm so sorry! I'll really work hard so this never happens again!\\" \\"Do you want to leave when I tell you to, or do you want to get hurt and then leave?\\" \\"······\\" Hope had just been extinguished. Woojin had been barely making a living by working at this pizza shop. The now diminished Woojin struggled to speak again. \\"···Then at least the money I've earned so far-\\" -Smack! The pizza shop owner threw a few bills and coins. Of course, it was far from enough. \\"The mistakes you made and the money you couldn't collect today are deducted! Get out now!\\" Woojin looked down at the money scattered at his feet and slowly reached out his hand. His pride told him not to pick it up. His self-esteem hit rock bottom. But reason and reality corrected him. Pride and self-esteem don't give money. When he reached out to the floor, irritation surged, but as soon as he picked up the scattered bills, a great sense of emptiness spread. \\"Yeah. This must be right.\\" He endured. Woojin accepted the pervasive and quiet oppression as he always had. After picking up all the money, he left the pizza shop. From behind, he heard the sound of the pizza shop owner spitting on the floor. He ignored it. Kang Woojin walked again. After a few steps, he saw a store with several TVs on display. A woman in a suit on the TV was giving a statement. -[“Control your anger, uncontrolled anger is a disease. You need to get treated. Anger is the root of many problems.”] The well-dressed woman seemed to be an expert in psychology. And it sounded as if she was speaking directly to the current Woojin, to 'Henry Gordon,' filled with a sense of loss. Woojin walked on, muttering to himself. \\"That's right, if I had gotten angry, I wouldn't have gotten any money.\\" Suddenly, a light drizzle began to fall. People on the street without umbrellas started to run. But Woojin. \\"······\\" He just put on his worn hood over his head. A bus stopped in front of him at the crosswalk. A child in the window was smiling brightly. Woojin forced a smile in response to the child. It didn't last long. The mother covered the child's eyes with her hand. Soon, the smile disappeared from Woojin's face. He had adapted to the repeated excessive prejudice. Several words swirled in his head. Endure, bear, ignore, overlook, close your eyes. Suppress your anger. \\"I need to... find a job.\\" At home, his mentally unstable younger sister was waiting. There was no time to rest. Soon, a sense of suffocation rose. The rain grew heavier. -Swoosh! Kang Woojin picked up a newspaper from the trash can in front of him. He was about to cover his head with it when he hesitated. It was because of the headline on the front page of the newspaper. 『Bank robbers, whose whereabouts were mysterious, found unconscious in front of the police station! Who is the hidden hero?』 'Hidden hero.' Such articles had been frequent lately. Soon, Woojin, who had snorted softly, threw the newspaper back into the trash can. Hero. It sounds good to hear. But a hero needs a villain to exist, right? Thinking about it, how many villains did Kang Woojin encounter today? But Woojin couldn't defeat any of them. Why? He had arrived home. A tiny room with just one space and a bathroom. His sister was sleeping on the worn bed. After covering her with a blanket, Woojin entered the bathroom. He looked in the mirror. \\"······\\" He tried to smile again. But for some reason, anger surged up. His face was smiling, but his heart was burning with rage. I didn't do anything. But why? Why only me? All the kindness he had shown to the world throughout the day was a defense mechanism for survival. Woojin clenched his fist. He was about to break the mirror with his fist out of anger, but he held back. Instead. -Smack! He threw the soap on the floor. He had reached his limit. A few days later. Kang Woojin's perspective changed once again. Now, he was jumping around at the entrance of a large supermarket parking lot, holding an advertising sign. He had found a new job. However, his appearance and outfit were peculiar. Lightly reddened hair, a face painted white, sharp red squares drawn around two eyes, thick lips painted like a stretched smile. His clothes were that of a clown. The 'Pierrot' holding and shaking the advertising sign. While he was shaking it, a familiar male voice came from behind. \\"Hey- Henry.\\" The 'Pierrot,' or Henry Gordon, or Kang Woojin, turned his head. A burly man was chuckling. It was the owner of the pizza shop he had quit. \\"Keke, right? Hey Henry. You suit this look with your slightly hunched back.\\" \\"······\\" \\"Or is it because you're so skinny? Dance, dance. 'Pierrot' should move the customers.\\" Contempt, oppression, discrimination, prejudice, disdain. Perhaps even more than that. All these foul-smelling things swirled around Kang Woojin. Anger was rising. But what could he do? In the end, Woojin just stood there stupidly. The pizza shop owner chuckled for a few minutes and then disappeared in the direction of the mart. The 'Pierrot' who had put down the advertising sign just watched his back. \\"······\\" His expression was indescribable. And on a rainy night. The burly owner of the pizza shop was alone, drinking beer and watching TV after closing up shop. -Rumble! Thunder mixed with the sound of rain. At that moment, the door of the pizza shop creaked open. The pizza shop owner turned his face, slightly startled. A drenched figure stood there. No, it was 'Pierrot.' As soon as he saw 'Pierrot,' the pizza shop owner recognized who it was and jumped up, shouting. \\"Henry?! You bastard, why are you here!\\" Simultaneously with the thunder and lightning. -Rumble! The sound of gunfire was drowned out by the noise. -Bang bang! 'Pierrot,' or Kang Woojin, stood with a gun in one hand. The pizza shop owner lay sprawled on the floor, blood slowly spreading. At this moment. \\"······Ah.\\" Kang Woojin regretted it. He also felt the anger he had been holding back suddenly burst out, and strangely, his hunched shoulders straightened. So did his back. Then there was a flash. The lightning from outside illuminated the dark face of 'Pierrot.' Although it was still the face of 'Pierrot,' the red around the eyes was running down due to the rainwater. It looked like a face crying red tears of blood. Kang Woojin laughed. \\"Kekeke! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!\\" It wasn't forced. Then something caught Woojin's eye. It was one of the items that had fallen to the floor when the pizza shop owner collapsed. Among several cards, one stood out. Kang Woojin picked up the card stained with blood. \\"Um-\\" On the card was a drawing of a clown or 'Pierrot.' -'JOKER' How much time had passed? Kang Woojin, who had been living in the world of 'Pierrot' as 'Henry Gordon,' had somehow returned to reality, inside a van. Outside the window, it was still snowing heavily. Nothing had changed from the moment Woojin entered the void. However. \\"Huh- A bit stiff?\\" Woojin, who had lived a brutal life, had directly experienced and performed extraordinary things. Or should it be said that he had gone through a 'villain's origin' as a villain? If it hadn't been for the concept, Woojin might have laughed his head off right now. It was because of the lingering aftereffects of the clown, 'Pierrot.' But Woojin, like a veteran of the void, erased the frenzy and madness he had experienced. Then, maintaining a poker face, he looked down at the 'Pierrot' scenario resting on his knees. \\"What should I say - the scenario is interesting, but experiencing it directly is a whole different dimension?\\" The scenario itself was filled with countless emotions, and the dialogue and stage directions were littered with 'subtext.' Subtext was like a mine that the writer or screenwriter had secretly planted. It was the real meaning hidden within the dialogue or stage directions. The protagonist 'Henry Gordon' was also unique. At first, he was weak, with low self-esteem, a model of the underdog, but the anger and rage building up inside him were stronger than anyone else's. However, as the story progressed, 'Henry Gordon,' who became filled with madness and pleasure, had no anger or rage. Woojin, who had experienced the role of 'Henry Gordon' several times, thought. 'I could probably use 'freedom of role' or 'role synthesis' - 'beastification' as well.' He was talking about releasing the villain from 'Pierrot' into reality. 'Or other abilities too. Hmm, that could be interesting.' Of course, in an upgraded state. Meanwhile, in LA. It was morning in Korea, but it was afternoon in LA. In the bustling Hollywood, several times noisier than Korea, inside a medium-sized conference room of 'Columbia Studio,' which was hot with 'Pierrot,' sat Director An Gabok with an interpreter, and on the opposite side were executives of 'Columbia Studio.' There were four of them. Director An Gabok had been called in suddenly while working on a nearby set or stage. Therefore. 'What's this? Their expressions are a bit - serious.' Director An Gabok observed the expressions of the bald executive among others from 'Columbia Studio,' who were heavily involved in the movie 'Pierrot.' They looked very serious. It almost felt like a secret meeting. It was around this time. \\"Director.\\" One of the executives, the bald man, handed a transparent file to Director An Gabok. \\"There's something you need to know.\\" \\"······\\" Without saying much, Director An Gabok took the transparent file handed to him. At the same time, the bald executive said. \\"'Pierrot' will undergo a title change before its release.\\" \\"···The title?\\" \\"Yes. It's similar but a little different. As you can see, it will change to 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.'\\" Repeating the new title 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' the bald executive continued. \\"Also, the movie 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' will be the starting point of a large-scale project that we have been planning in secret, preparing for quite some time. A series of movies that are organically connected, a cinematic universe. The male lead of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' 'Henry Gordon,' will be.\\" He spoke calmly and firmly. \\"The first villain character to announce our cinematic universe to the world.\\""},{"prompt":"389화 압도 (18) ‘혈육여자’. 아니, 강우진의 여동생 강현아가 어버버대는 모습에 우진은 속으로 악동스런 미소를 지었다. ‘얘 이거 혼 빠졌네, 아- 겁나 놀리고 싶다.’ 저런 표정일 때 괴롭히는 게 제맛인데. 원래의 알맹이 강우진이라면 ‘괜찮냐? 얼굴 못생긴 거.’ 따위의 장난을 쳐야 마땅했다. ‘아니면 갑자기 얼굴 발사하지 말라고 말하고 싶다, 존잼인데.’ 그럼 강현아는 또 길길이 날뛰겠지. 허나 그 과거의 신나는 타격감을 떠올리던 우진은 참아야 했다. 수백 팬들이 몰렸기에 근엄함은 유지해야 하니까. 이럴 땐 컨셉질이 조금 아쉽기도 했다. 어쨌든 우진은 혼 빠진 여동생에게 목소리를 깔았다. “갑자기 그게 무슨 소리야.” 일단은 모른 척 시전. 더욱 눈 커진 강현아가 자신의 핸드폰을 쭉 내밀었다. “이, 이런 기사가 방금 떴는데??” 그녀의 핸드폰에는 방금 뜬 듯한 기사가 출력되고 있었고. 『[스타톡]‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 발표한 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실사화 배역 중, ‘야수’ 역 후보 배우에 강우진 포함』 기사를 보던 강우진의 표정은 변화가 없었다. 애초 강현아가 ‘야수’역의 후보 배우냐 물었을 때부터 눈치챘으니까. 아마 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 배역 후보 배우들을 발표한 거겠지. ‘근데 이번에도 좀 뜬금없긴 하네.’ 느낌은 ‘삐에로’때와 비슷했다. 하지만 ‘야수와 미녀’의 원작이 세계적으로 사랑받는 만큼, 이번 발표가 일으킬 파장은 ‘삐에로’ 때와는 규모가 판이할 것이 분명했다. 강우진 스스로도 그리 생각했다. ‘나라도 ‘야수’ 역 후보 배우에 한국배우 있으면 좀 놀랄 듯.’ 본인과 같이 후보 배우로 확정된 배우들을 신경 쓰지 않은 우진이었지만 안 봐도 훤했다. 헐리웃 탑배우들이 줄줄이겠지. 잠시간 혼자 생각에 빠졌던 우진이 시선을 다시금 올렸다. 핸드폰에서 얼빠진 여동생 강현아에게. 그리곤 별수롭지 않게 답했다. “응, 맞아. 기사 내용.” 워낙에 낮은 톤의 대답이라 그런지 강현아도 자연스레 받아들이는 거 같다가. “아- 맞아? 난 또 오빠가 진짜 배우 후보로······어??!! 마, 맞다고?!!!” 와락 비명을 질렀다. 그녀의 괴성이 백화점 로비 전체로 울렸다. 덕분에 모인 수백 팬들의 웅성거림이 몇 배는 커졌다. 하지만 우진은 당황하는 것 없이 고개를 끄덕였다. “어. 맞다고.” “······” 눈과 입이 디립다 커진 채 얼어붙은 강현아가 잠시 멈춰 있다가 어렵사리 말을 뱉었다. “······헐.” 이쯤부터 수백이 모인 백화점의 팬 사인회가 뒤집혔다. “%&&#^^@*!*!!” “우진오빠!*&#%*(#(*%*(#” “꺅!!*#%*#(%@)(” 웅성거림이 괴랄한 비명이 되어 웅웅 울렸으니까. 수백 팬들은 죄다 방방 뛰면서도 핸드폰을 들었다, 그리곤 단상 위 우진을 미친 듯 찍어댔다. 흥분과 광분이 넘실거리는 상황. 팬사인회는 난장판으로 돌변. 반면, 우진은 쎈척을 유지하며 자리에 가만히 앉아 있었다. 하지만 속으론 약간 쫄았다. ‘이거이거 갑자기들 달려드는 거 아닌가?’ 그 정도로 수백 팬들의 반응이 과격했다. 그것을 눈앞에서 보고 있으니 움찔하는 게 당연. 수십 가드들이 어렵게 막고는 있지만 시간문제 같았다. 이쯤. “우진아.” 뒤쪽에서 직원들과 얘기하던 꽁지머리 최성건이 강우진에게 다가왔다. 작게 귓속말하는 그. “일단, 자리 정리하자. 얘기는 해놨어, 팬사인회는 나중에 다시 하기로하고 빠지는 거로.” “예, 대표님.” 들었던 팬을 내린 우진이 자리서 일어났다. 그의 움직임에 정면의 수백 팬들, 위층 난간에 붙은 인파들의 목청이 더욱 강렬해졌다. 강우진은 단상을 내려가려다 대뜸 멈췄다. 이어 정면으로 몸을 돌려 광분한 수백 팬들에게 손짓했다. 잠깐 조용히 해달라는 것. 데시벨이 현저히 낮아진 상태에서 우진이 입을 열었고. “지금 기사나 소식을 접하셨을 텐데요. ‘삐에로’와 ‘야수와 미녀’. 두 작품 모두 제가 후보 배우로 결정된 게 맞습니다.” 덤덤하게 말을 이었다. “후보가 아니라, 배역 확정 배우 기사를 보실 수 있게끔 해보겠습니다.” 곧, 귀가 찢길 듯한 비명이 백화점을 가득 메웠다. 이후. 새해가 중간쯤 지난 시점, 여러 이슈들로 시끌벅적한 국내에 강우진이 다시금 쓰나미를 터트렸다. 아니, 정확하게는 헐리웃의 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 일으켰다 봐야했다. 일말의 예고도 없이, 그야말로 느닷없이 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 ‘야수와 미녀’의 주요 배역 후보 배우를 발표했으니까. 그것을 강우진은 밴 안에서 듣고 있었다. “이번 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실사화에 큰 관심을 주셔서 감사합니다.” 브리핑을 맡은 것은 조수석의 최성건. 우진은 포커페이스를 유지한 채였지만 귀는 쫑긋 세우고 있었다. 물론, 주변의 팀원들도 마찬가지. “SNS나 커뮤니티 사이로 ‘야수와 미녀’의 가상 캐스팅이 횡횡한 것을 알고 있습니다. 이 역시 높은 애정으로 생각합니다. 이에 주요 캐릭터들의 정식 후보 배우를 발표합니다. 먼저, ‘미녀 벨라’ 역.” 최성건의 입에서 헐리웃에서도 탑 티어인 여배우들의 이름이 나열됐다. 한 명 한 명 불릴 때마다 팀원들이 오오오 거렸다. 그 정도로 유명한 배우들이었으니까. 팀원들과 비교해 미적지근하긴 했다만 강우진도 반응했다. ‘아- 방금 불린 여배우 누구였지? 어디서 많이 들었는데.’ 크리스 하트넷과 비슷했다. 유명한 건 알겠는데 누군지 가물가물한 게 함정. 그러다 최성건의 입에서 익숙한 이름이 불렸다. “마일리 카라.” 오? 마일리 카라도? 의외였다. 당연히 우진도 인터넷에 떠도는 가상 캐스팅보드를 봤다. 마일리 카라가 많이 언급되는 것 역시 알았다. 그런데 그게 진짜였어? 그녀에게 직접적으로 들은 적은 없었다. ‘우연? 뭐, 그렇겠지?’ 스타일리스트 몇몇이 끼었다. “우진 오빠랑 마일리 카라랑 연이 깊나 봐요!” “그니까, ‘야수와 미녀’는 진짜 우연으로 겹친 걸 텐데. 맞죠? 오빠 들은 거 없으시죠?” “응, 없어.” “근데 ‘미녀 벨라’에 마일리 카라가 찐으로 찰떡이긴 해요.” 강우진도 공감했다. 이때 최성건이 ‘야수’ 역의 후보 배우들을 읊었다. 역시 난다긴다하는 헐리웃 탑배우들이 호명됐다. 그중 인기 절정인 팝가수도 포함이었다. 끝으로. “그리고- 강우진.” 팀원들이 감격스런 괴성을 질러댔다. 그 사이 최성건이 다시 말했다. “어우- 이 게시물 댓글 핵폭탄 터졌다.” 다들 궁금했는지 핸드폰을 들었다. 강우진도 마찬가지. 그의 말은 사실이었다. ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 올린 SNS 게시글엔 어마무시한 댓글이 달린 상태였다. 현재진행형이며 언어 역시 각양각색. ‘미친? 개쩌네 진짜?’ 수만 댓글을 가뿐히 넘기는 중. 강우진이 대충 댓글들을 훑었다. 뭐랄까, 진창이었다. 역시 당장은 욕이 몇 배는 더 많이 보였다. 뭐 이는 우진도 예상했던 그림이기에 대수롭지 않았다. 하지만 최성건이나 팀원들의 표정은 어두웠고. “······각오는 했다만- 심한데?” 강우진은 검색의 결을 바꿨다. 일단, 국내 1등 검색사이트부터 접속. 페이지가 뜨자마자 뉴스 1면에 강우진의 얼굴이 대문짝만하게 실렸다. 『실사화 확정 ‘야수와 미녀’ 후보 배우에 강우진이 올랐다!』 그 밑으로 나열된 역시 죄다 강우진의 이름이 박힌 기사들이었다. 『‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 발표한 ‘야수와 미녀’ 후보 배우들, 월드스타들 즐비한 사이 강우진이?』 『[이슈톡]또 다시 국내를 발칵 뒤집은 강우진, 대뜸 밝혀진 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’의 대표작 ‘야수와 미녀’ 합류 소식!』 · · · 지금 이 순간에도 기사들은 끝없이 양산되고 있었다. 자극이 팽배한 소식이긴 했다. ‘삐에로’ 등으로 워낙 미친 이슈성을 보이는 강우진에, 최근 실사화 확정으로 화제였던 ‘야수와 미녀’가 붙었으니까. 모두의 추억에 서린 그 작품에 강우진의 이름이 포함될 줄을 그 누가 예상했겠는가? 뒤로 언론과 국내 각종 매체는 이 이슈를 단독으로 다루기 시작했다. 『‘삐에로’에 이어 ‘야수와 미녀’까지? 강우진, 저번 LA행에서 무슨 일이 있었나?』 기사, 뉴스, 라디오 등 종일 우진의 이름이 정신없이 오르내렸다. 연말부터 새해까지 강우진이 보인 행보는 죄다 사상 최초였으니 당연했다. 거기다 이번 건은 몸집이 상당히 컸다. 강우진에게 큰 관심이 없어도 눈이 휘둥그레질 정도. “엥? 강우진이 ‘야수’ 역 후보 배우라고?? 헐? 진심?” “어어, 지금 기사 뜨고 난리잖아!” “와- 대반전이네?! 미쳤다, 좀 뜬금없는데 개놀랐어!” “그니까!” “그러면 뭐야? 강우진이 오디션 합격하면 ‘야수’ 역하는 건가? 대박, 좀 소름인데??” 다음 날에도 화력은 줄지 않았다. 아침 뉴스부터 강우진이 소개됐고 기사는 어제보다 몇 배는 늘었다. 거기다 너튜브 역시 특종의 냄새를 맡고 강우진으로 도배됐다.

DM 프로덕션. ‘이로운 악’의 제작을 맡은 DM 프로덕션의 대형 편집실. 퀴퀴한 냄새가 가득하다. 그런 편집실에 피곤함에 찌든 편집 기사들이 옹기종기 모여 앉아 있다. “······” “······” 그들은 전부 말없이 여러 모니터들이 달린 정면을 응시하는 중이었다. 숨 쉬는 것 빼면 멈춘 상태. 다만, 그들 중 가운데에 앉은 턱수염 남자는 움직이고 있었다. 송만우 PD였다. -타닥, 다다닥. 편집기기를 부드럽게 조작하는 그. 그새 턱수염이 더 자랐고 눈 밑에 다크서클은 몇 배나 더 짙어졌다. 국내를 넘어 세계로 우진의 이름이 날리는 와중에도, 송만우 PD는 흔들리는 것 없이 집중하고 있었다. -♬♪ 편집실에 노래가 틀어졌다가 꺼졌다. 모니터들에 강우진의 얼굴이 나왔다가 멈췄다. 그렇게 몇십 분간 홀로 기기들을 조작하던 송만우 PD가. -스윽. 돌연 등을 의자에 움푹 기대며 긴 한숨을 내쉬었다. “후- 어찌저찌.” 편집 기사들은 침을 꿀떡 삼키며 그를 바라봤고, 송만우 PD는 양손으로 얼굴에 마른세수를 퍼부었다. 대략 몇 초. 이어 송만우 PD가 핸드폰을 꺼내 어디론가 전화를 걸었다. 신호가 짧다. 상대가 받았는지 그가 입을 열었다. “예, 총괄디렉터님.” 핸드폰 너머는 넷플렉스 코리아의 김소향이었고, 긍정이든 부정이든 세계로 우진의 이름이 떡상하는 와중. “편집 끝났습니다.” ‘이로운 악’의 출격 준비가 끝났다.","completion":"Episode 389: Overwhelming (18) 'Family Girl.' No, Kang Woojin's sister, Kang Hyun-ah, was stammering, and Woojin inwardly smirked mischievously. 'She's totally flustered, ah- I really want to tease her.' It was the perfect moment to tease her. The original Kang Woojin would have played a prank like, 'Are you okay? Your face looks terrible.' 'Or I suddenly want to tell her not to launch her face at me, it would be so fun.' Then Kang Hyun-ah would throw a fit. However, Woojin, who was reminiscing about the thrilling sensation of the past, had to restrain himself. With hundreds of fans gathered, he had to maintain his dignity. At times like this, he somewhat regretted not being able to stick to his concept. Anyway, Woojin addressed his bewildered sister with a tone of voice. \\"What are you talking about all of a sudden?\\" Pretending to be clueless for now. Kang Hyun-ah, with her eyes widened even more, thrust her phone forward. \\"This, this article just came out??\\" On her phone, there was an article that seemed to have just been published. \\"[StarTalk] 'World Disney Pictures' announces 'Beauty and the Beast' live-action casting, Kang Woojin included as a candidate for the role of 'Beast'\\" Woojin's expression didn't change as he looked at the article. He had suspected it since Kang Hyun-ah asked if he was a candidate for the role of 'Beast.' Probably 'World Disney Pictures' had announced the candidates for the roles. 'But this is a bit out of the blue.' The feeling was similar to the time with 'Pierrot.' However, given the global love for the original 'Beauty and the Beast,' the impact of this announcement was bound to be on a different scale than 'Pierrot.' Woojin himself thought so. 'Even I would be surprised if there was a Korean actor among the candidates for the role of 'Beast.'' Woojin didn't pay much attention to the other actors confirmed as candidates, but it was obvious. It would be a lineup of top Hollywood actors. Woojin, who had been lost in thought for a moment, raised his gaze again. To his sister Kang Hyun-ah, who looked dumbfounded by the phone, and he replied nonchalantly. \\"Yeah, that's right. The content of the article.\\" Perhaps because of his low tone, Kang Hyun-ah seemed to naturally accept it. \\"Ah- really? I thought you were really a candidate for the actor... What??!! You mean it's true?!!!\\" She screamed out loud. Her shriek echoed throughout the department store lobby. Thanks to her, the murmurs of the hundreds of fans gathered grew several times louder. But Woojin nodded without any sign of panic. \\"Yeah. It's true.\\" \\"······\\" Kang Hyun-ah, with her eyes and mouth wide open, froze for a moment before managing to speak. \\"······Wow.\\" From this point on, the fan signing event at the department store turned upside down. \\"%&&#^^@*!*!!\\" \\"Woojin oppa!*&#%*(#(*%*(#\\" \\"Kyaa!!*#%*#(%@)(\\" The murmurs turned into wild screams. The hundreds of fans were jumping up and down while holding their phones, frantically taking pictures of Woojin on the stage. The signing event turned into chaos amidst the excitement and frenzy. Meanwhile, Woojin maintained his cool demeanor, sitting quietly in his place. But inside, he was a bit nervous. 'Are they going to rush at me all of a sudden?' The reaction of the hundreds of fans was that intense. It was natural to flinch at the sight of it. Dozens of guards were struggling to hold them back, but it seemed like a matter of time. At this point. \\"Woojin.\\" Choi Seong-gun, with his ponytail, who had been talking with the staff, approached Kang Woojin. He whispered softly. \\"Let's wrap up here for now. I've arranged it, we'll postpone the fan signing event and leave.\\" \\"Yes, President.\\" Woojin stood up, putting down the fan he was holding. His movement made the hundreds of fans in front of him and the crowd clinging to the upper floor railings even more vocal. Kang Woojin was about to step down from the stage when he suddenly stopped. Then he turned to face the frenzied hundreds of fans and gestured to them. He was asking for a moment of silence. With the decibel level significantly lowered, Woojin spoke. \\"As you may have heard from the news, 'Pierrot' and 'Beauty and the Beast.' It's true that I've been decided as a candidate actor for both works.\\" He continued calmly. \\"I'll try to make sure you can see articles about me being confirmed for the roles, not just as a candidate.\\" Soon, the department store was filled with ear-splitting screams. Afterward. At a point when the new year was halfway through, amidst various issues causing a stir in Korea, Kang Woojin once again unleashed a tsunami. Or rather, it should be said that 'World Disney Pictures' in Hollywood had caused it. Without any prior warning, 'World Disney Pictures' suddenly announced the candidate actors for the main roles in 'Beauty and the Beast.' Kang Woojin was listening to this in the van. \\"Thank you for your great interest in the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast.'\\" The briefing was conducted by Choi Seong-gun in the passenger seat. Woojin maintained a poker face, but his ears were perked up. Of course, the team members around him felt the same. \\"I am aware of the virtual casting of 'Beauty and the Beast' that has been rampant on SNS and community sites. We consider this a sign of high affection. Therefore, we announce the official candidate actors for the main characters. First, the role of 'Bella the Beauty.'\\" From Choi Seong-gun's mouth came the names of actresses who were top-tier even in Hollywood. The team members exclaimed \\"Ooh\\" with each name called. They were that famous. Although Woojin's reaction was lukewarm compared to the team members, he did respond. 'Ah- who was that actress just called? I've heard her name a lot.' It was similar to Chris Hartnett. He knew she was famous, but he couldn't quite place her. Then, a familiar name was called by Choi Seong-gun. \\"Miley Kara.\\" Oh? Miley Kara too? It was unexpected. Of course, Woojin had seen the virtual casting boards floating around the internet. He knew that Miley Kara was frequently mentioned. But was that real? He had never heard it directly from her. 'Coincidence? Well, probably.' A few stylists joined in. \\"It seems like Woojin oppa and Miley Kara have a deep connection!\\" \\"I mean, 'Beauty and the Beast' really overlapped by coincidence. Right? Oppa, you haven't heard anything, have you?\\" \\"No, I haven't.\\" \\"But Miley Kara really fits the role of 'Bella the Beauty.'\\" Woojin agreed. Then Choi Seong-gun recited the names of the candidate actors for the role of 'Beast.' Again, it was a list of top Hollywood actors who were making waves. Among them was also a pop singer at the peak of popularity. Finally. \\"And- Kang Woojin.\\" The team members let out cries of joy. Amidst this, Choi Seong-gun spoke again. \\"Wow- the comments on this post are like a nuclear bomb.\\" Curious, everyone picked up their phones. Woojin did the same. His words were true. The SNS post by 'World Disney Pictures' was bombarded with an astonishing number of comments. It was ongoing, and the languages were diverse. 'Crazy? This is really something.' The comments easily surpassed tens of thousands. Kang Woojin skimmed through them. It was a mess. As expected, there were several times more insults than anything else. But this didn't bother Woojin, as he had anticipated it. However, the expressions of Choi Seong-gun and the team members were gloomy. \\"······I was prepared, but- it's harsh, isn't it?\\" Woojin changed his search approach.

A few days later, on the 18th, at DM Production. The large editing room of DM Production, which was in charge of producing 'Beneficial Evil,' was filled with a musty smell. In that editing room, exhausted editors huddled together. \\"······\\" \\"······\\" They were all silently staring at the monitors in front of them. Except for breathing, they were motionless. However, the bearded man sitting in the middle was moving. It was Producer Song Man-woo. -Tap, tap-tap. He smoothly operated the editing equipment. His beard had grown longer, and the dark circles under his eyes had deepened several times over. Even as Kang Woojin's name was flying around the world, Song Man-woo was focused without any wavering. -♬♪ Music played and stopped in the editing room. Kang Woojin's face appeared and paused on the monitors. After operating the equipment alone for several minutes, Producer Song Man-woo. -Swish. Suddenly leaned back in his chair and let out a long sigh. \\"Phew- somehow.\\" The editing staff swallowed their saliva and looked at him, and Song Man-woo splashed his face with his hands as if washing it. After a few seconds, he took out his phone and made a call somewhere. The signal was short. As the other side picked up, he spoke. \\"Yes, Chief Director.\\" On the other end of the phone was Kim So-hyang from Netflix Korea, and amidst the world buzzing with Woojin's soaring name, whether positive or negative. \\"The editing is finished.\\" The preparations for the launch of 'Beneficial Evil' were complete."},{"prompt":"392화 박살 (1) 인상이 센 ‘삐에로’의 총괄 프로듀서가 말한 오디션 방식은 간단했다. 지정 연기는 빼고 자유 연기로 가되, 그 자유 연기로 보여야 할 인물은 지정한다는 거였다. 확정한 인물은 ‘삐에로’의 남주 ‘헨리 고든’. 오늘 모인 후보 배우들은 어떤 모습을, 연기를 보여도 OK였다. 하지만 무조건 포장지는 ‘헨리 고든’이어야 한다. 이는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 측이 후보 배우들에게 사전에 공유하지 않은 사안. 그렇기에. “갑작스럽군.” 헐리웃 배우들은 티는 안 냈지만 약간 황당해했다. “기껏 준비한 것들이 전부 허사가 됐어. 이렇게 갑자기 바꾸는 게 어딨어?” “목소리가 커.” “하지만 내 말이 사실이잖아.” 지정, 자유 연기를 준비하라더니 대뜸 룰을 바꿨으니 투덜댈 만은 했다. “이건 예상 못 했어. 어쩐다, 준비한 것을 서로 섞어야 하나?” “집중해. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’는 아마 너나 배우들의 순발력을 보려는 거 같으니까.” “흠.” “그리 문제 될 건 없잖아, 어차피 ‘헨리 고든’은 지정 연기로서 준비됐고, 네가 말한 대로 자유 연기에 ‘헨리 고든’만 얹으면 되잖아.” “그게 쉽게 쉽게 되냐고. 하여튼 조용히 해봐, 생각 좀 하게.” 이는 크리스 하트넷도 마찬가지였다. 그래도 다른 배우들과 비교하는 그는 차분한 편이었다. “크리스, 괜찮아?” “괜찮아. 당황할 거 없어. 조금 놀라긴 했는데 이정도 일은 헐리웃에서 자주 있잖아.” “그렇긴 하지.” “이럴 땐 차라리 공격적인 게 나아.” “어쩌려고?” 매니저의 되물음에 답하지 않은 크리스 하트넷은 대뜸 고개를 왼쪽으로 돌렸다. 조금 떨어진 곳에 앉은 강우진을 본 것. 곧, 크리스의 두 눈이 살짝 커졌다. 우진이 너무도 태연하게. 아니, 어쩌면 심드렁한 얼굴로 턱을 괴고 있었으니까. ‘······아무렇지도 않은 건가? 아니면 별생각이 없어? 도대체 가늠이 어려운 남자군. 무슨 생각을 하는 거야? 음- 그래도 상황이 상황인 만큼 심각하겠지만 안 그런 척을 하고있는 거겠지.’ 틀렸다. 현재 강우진은 그야말로 대수롭지 않았다. 생각도 많지 않았다. ‘그래서 언제 시작한다는 거임?’ 그에겐 지정, 자유건 ‘헨리 고든’이 발린 자유 연기건 개똥이건 아무 문제가 없었으니까. 어차피 준비해온 지정 연기도, 자유 연기도 ‘헨리 고든’이기도 했다. 뭐 행여 문제가 있더라도. -스윽. 그의 손엔 검은 사각형이 뜬 ‘삐에로’ 시나리오가 있으니 걱정할 것도 없었다. 이쯤. “조금 갑작스러운 것도 있으니.” 무대 위 테이블의 총괄 프로듀서가 배우들에게 안내했다. “10분 뒤 시작하겠습니다.” 이건 여유를 준다기보다는 심호흡할 시간을 할애했을 뿐이었다. 10분 준다고 뭘 크게 준비하고 그럴 수는 없으니까. 실제로 10분은 삽시간에 지나갔다. 곧, 프로듀서가 재차 움직였다. 그녀는 바로 앞 모니터들의 상태를 점검한 뒤 배우 중 한 명을 호명했다. “순서는 우리가 임의로 정했습니다. 톰 브란도. 올라오세요.” 적당한 체구에 잘생겼다기보다는 남자다운 얼굴의 배우가 일어났다. 이름은 톰 브란도. 헐리웃에서 연기파로 유명한 탑배우였다. 그 역시 ‘헨리 고든’처럼 정장을 입었는데 색감은 단조로웠다. 회색, 검은색, 갈색이 섞였다. 분장은 안 했다. 그런 톰 브란도가 처음으로 사방에 카메라 놓인 무대에 올랐다. -슥. 참고로 무대엔 카메라만 있는 게 아니었다. 한쪽 구석엔 여러 소품들이 즐비했고, 1인 소파나 의자들도 비치됐다. 사용하는 건 배우들 나름이었다. 톰 브란도가 무대 중간쯤 섰을 때, 심사위원석에 앉은 안가복 감독의 시선은 여러 대인 모니터에 닿았다. 배우의 풀샷과 바스트 정면, 측면, 뒷모습 등이 출력되고 있다. 안가복 감독이 주름진 볼을 쓸었다. ‘과연, 헐리웃 탑이군. 카메라에 담기는 아우라가 남달라.’ 그 포함 여자 프로듀서 외로 심사위원 전부가 모니터를 보고 있었다. 오디션도 오디션이지만, 모니터에 담기는 스크린 테스트도 중요하니까. 이어 총괄 프로듀서가 무대에 선 톰 브란도에게 고개를 끄덕였다. “준비됐으면 하셔도 됩니다.” 말이 끝나기 무섭게 톰 브란도가 표정과 자세를 달리했다. 한 손을 주머니에 쑤셨고 허리는 꼿꼿했다. 얼굴은 약간 꺾었다. 입가엔 미세한 웃음이 걸렸다. 뭐랄까, ‘삐에로’ 속 ‘헨리 고든’의 각성한 후반부 모습을 보이는 듯했다. 단숨에 이미지를 바꾼 톰 브란도의 모습에 심사위원들의 얼굴엔 진중함이 묻었고. ‘연기야 나무랄 게 없는 배우지, 역시 곧바로 우리가 원하는 모습으로 탈바꿈되는군.’ ‘공기를 단숨에 바꿨어. 조커(Joker)를 연기하려는 건가?’ ‘음, 상상했던 후반부 ‘헨리 고든’의 모습이야.‘ 연기파 배우 톰 브란도가 주변의 카메라들을 둘러보며 픽 웃었다. “이 빌어먹을 시선들. 전부 잔뜩 쫄아서 무서워하고 있을 뿐이라고. 그걸 나한테 강요하지 마. 너희들의 친절은 그저 죽기 싫어서 하는 방어야, 나는 내 멋대로 할 거라고?” 톰 브란도가 뱉는 말들. 실제와 다름없는 모습. 전혀 이질감이 보이지 않는 ‘헨리 고든’이었다. 이유야 간단했다. “정신치료? 뭘 치료해? 당신의 썩어빠진 뇌나 고치라고.” 처음으로 오디션에 오른 톰 브란도는 정공법을 택했다. 지금 그는 ‘삐에로’ 시나리오 속의 ‘헨리 고든’을 연기하고 있었다. 뭐 자유 연기라고 했으니 상관없긴 했다. 거기다 실제로 이게 더 먹히는 방법일지도 몰랐다. ‘······좋아, 기대한 대로 잘해.’ ‘시나리오 연기를 해주니 그림이 그려지는군.’ 자유 연기로 택한 톰 브란도의 ‘삐에로’ 시나리오 연기는, 안가복 감독 포함 심사위원들에게 실제 촬영을 방불케 하는 기분을 선사했으니까. 연기도 수준급이다 보니 위력은 두 배였고, 심사위원들의 근본적인 호기심을 해소해냈다. 의외로 공격적인 선택. 모인 후보 배우 중 가장 먼저 시나리오 연기를 보임으로서 입지를 다졌다. 거기다. ‘핵심이 될 컷을 골랐어.’ 톰 브란도가 택한 씬은 ‘삐에로’ 시나리오 중에서도 중요도가 높은 장면이었다. 그러니 더 기억에 남을 수밖에 없다. 그의 연기는 뒤로 약 10분 이상 진행됐다. 도중에 입을 여는 이는 없었다. 관객석의 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들은 매우 만족스런 얼굴이었고, 헐리웃 배우들은 위기감이 서린 표정을 남몰래 지었다. 심사위원들은 모니터 보며 뭔가를 적기 바빴다. 그렇게 톰 브란도의 연기가 끝났다. “여기까지 하겠습니다.” ‘헨리 고든’의 냄새를 단숨에 빼내는 그. 속도로 보자면 우진이 약간 앞서지만 비슷한 느낌마저 들었다. 경력만 20년이 넘었으니 당연했다. 잠시간 심사위원들과 대화하던 톰 브란도가 무대를 내려간다. 직전 대화엔 딱히 평가가 오가진 않았다. 여긴 배우를 평가하는 자리라기보단, 어떤 배우가 ‘헨리 고든’에 더 잘 어울릴지 판단을 내리는 자리니까. 어쨌든 첫 번째 배우의 순서 만에 오디션의 급이 확 높아졌고. “다음, 잭 게이블.” 두 번째 헐리웃 탑배우가 불렸다. 뭔가 허약해 보이면서도 턱이 각진 잭 게이블. 분위기 있는 마스크의 배우였다. 그 역시 헐리웃에선 내로라하는 탑배우 중 한 명. 잭 게이블 역시 무대에 올라 여유롭게 연기를 보였다. 그가 반쯤 미친 모습을 펼쳤다. “흐힉! 흐흐흐. 어어어- 허헙!” 정신병원에 있는 건가? 무대 바닥을 기거나 급작스레 고함을 치는 등, 잭 게이블은 진짜 미친 사람과 다른 바 없었다. 사실적이고 생생했다. 거기다 그의 정신 빠진 모습에서. “놔! 놓으라고!” ‘헨리 고든’이 절절했다. 버릇을 카피했기 때문이었다. 구부정한 허리와 어깨, 말투, 눈빛 외로 시나리오 속 ‘헨리 고든’이 가진 미세한 것들을 잭 게이블은 아주 쉽게 구현했다. 그 역시 연기의 급은 베테랑 이상이었다. 직전의 톰 브란도와는 다른 맛이지만 역시나 강렬한 존재감을 뽐냈다. 안가복 감독은 모니터 속 그와 무대 위 잭 게이블을 번갈아 보면서 느꼈다. ‘그렇군, 지금 그는 ‘헨리 고든’의 미래를 창작해서 보이는 게야.’ 시나리오엔 표현되지 않은, 본인 스스로 상상해 만들어낸 ‘헨리 고든’의 말로를 자유 연기로 선보이는 거라고. 뭐랄까, 바로 전의 톰 브란도도 이번의 잭 게이블도 상상 이상이었다. 안가복 감독은 약간 혼란이 왔다. ‘각오는 했다만- 수준들이 다들 이렇게나 높으니 골치 아프군.’ 괴물들 사이에서 누구를 선택해야 하는가? 이번 잭 게이블의 차례에서도 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 8명 간부들은 만족한 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. ‘삐에로’의 20명 넘는 키스탭들도 작게작게 감탄했다. 배우들의 표정은 오묘했다. 경쟁자들이 잘하는 것을 반길 수는 없으니까. 하지만 단 한 명. “······” 오직 이 홀에서 유일하게 표정 변화가 없는 배우. 강우진이었다. 우진은 오디션 시작부터 지금까지 포커페이스에 흔들림이 없었다. 그저 단단한 얼굴로 다른 배우들의 연기를 볼뿐. 그때. “고생하셨습니다.” 잭 게이블의 차례가 끝났다. 그 역시 심사위원들과 간단한 대화를 나눈 뒤 무대를 내려갔다. 본인 스스로 성공했다 싶은지 잭 게이블의 입가엔 미소가 서렸다. 이어. “다음-” 다음 차례 배우의 프로필을 집은 심사위원 중 여자 프로듀서가 관객석에 시선을 돌렸다. “강우진.” 세 번째는 강우진이 불렸다. 곧, 헐리웃 배우들의 눈빛이 변했다. 크리스 하트넷이나 몇몇 배우는 앉은 우진의 얼굴을 돌아봤다. 헐리웃 배우들의 팀원들도, ‘삐에로’의 십수 명 키스탭들도, 제일 앞줄 좌석에 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들도, 무대 위 심사위원들도. 홀의 50명 넘는 모두가 강우진을 응시했다. 워낙에 핫했고 배우 중 가장 검증이 부족한 인물이었으니까. 더불어 제일 짙은 호기심을 불러일으키는 배우이기도 했다. 꽁지머리 최성건이 긴 숨을 뱉었다. “후- 돌겠네, 우진아. 잘하고 와라.” 심장이 터진다는 모션을 보이는 그. 반대로 강우진은 냉정함이 가득했다. “다녀올게요.” 너무도 차분해서인지 냉소적으로 보이기도 했다. 빨간 재킷과 바지, 노란 조끼, 헤진 갈색 구두의 강우진이 여유롭게 일어났다. -스윽. 헐리웃의 주연 오디션 중 그가 보인 첫걸음이 시작되는 순간이지만, 걸음을 옮기는 우진의 모습에는 긴장 따위 없었다. 뚜벅뚜벅. 거침없이 무대로 향하는 강우진에 따라, 홀에 있는 50명 넘는 시선이 따른다. 제각각의 눈빛이었다. 색안경, 의구심, 기대, 호기심, 무시 외의 다수. 꽁지머리를 다시 단단히 묶은 최성건이 침을 꿀떡 삼켰다. ‘아우- 염병. 심장 터지겄네, 우진이가 알아서 잘 하겠다만 왜 이렇게 내가 떨리냐.’ 딱히 우진에게 어떻게 오디션을 볼 거란 귀띔을 받은 적이 없었으니까. 하지만 최성건은 언제나 그렇듯 강우진에게 모든 걸 맡겼다. 그때 덤덤한 얼굴의 강우진이 여러 카메라가 놓인 무대에 올랐다. 곧, 심사위원석의 모니터에도 우진이 출력됐고 안가복 감독이 티 안 나게 긴장의 숨을 뱉었다. ‘이번엔 무슨 모습을 보여 줄 거야.’ 그뿐만이 아니었다. 안가복 감독 옆에 앉은 총괄 프로듀서도. ‘이래저래 헐리웃을 흔들어 놓은 한국배우, 어떤 연기를 준비해왔는지 볼까?’ 캐디도, 간부 두 명도, 관객석의 배우와 수십 인원들도. 전부 안가복 감독과 비슷한 말을 속으로 뱉고 있었다. ‘어디 한 번 보여봐라.’ 하지만 쉽지는 않을 거라는 게 속내에 내포됐다. 앞선 둘의 헐리웃 배우의 연기가 워낙에 대단했으니. 어쨌든 강우진이 무대에 오르자마자, 모니터에 그의 모습이 출력되자마자 총괄 프로듀서가 입을 열려고 했다. 하지만. “어?” 그녀의 말이 막혔다. 이유야 심플했다. -스윽. 우진이 돌발 행동을 보였으니까. 전의 헐리웃 배우들은 모두 무대에 오르면 중앙에 섰었다. 사방의 카메라가 집중하는 곳 말이다. 허나 지금 우진은 그딴 건 개나 주라는 태도로 무대 중앙을 스쳤다. 그리곤 약간 구석진 곳의 1인 소파에 도착하자마자 푹 앉았다. 사전 언급도 없이 ‘노빠꾸’였다. 덕분에 카메라에 붙은 외국인 스탭들이 재빨리 카메라를 돌렸다. 1인 소파에 멋대로 앉은 강우진, 그것을 사방에서 찍는 카메라들. 그림이 달라졌다. 지금까지는 카메라에 찍히기 위해 배우가 서는 구도였다면, 지금은 전체 카메라가 강우진만을 찍기 위한 그림이었다. 오디션에서 1인 토크쇼가 된 느낌. 그 모습에 순간 안가복 감독은 미간을 살짝 좁혔다. ‘······의도했나?’ 반대로 총괄 프로듀서 포함, 헐리웃 배우들부터 50명 넘는 외국인들은 영문을 모르겠다는 얼굴이었다. 반쯤은 두 눈을 끔뻑였다. 그 순간이었다. “아오-” 카메라와 홀의 모든 이의 시선을 주인공마냥 집중 받은 우진이 다리를 꼬면서도. “가면 쓰고 사는 거 더럽게 빡세다고.” 현란한 영어를 뱉어대기 시작했다. 여기서 눈에 띄는 것은. “이제부터 알맹이 나로 좀 말할까 하거든? 와, 이거 진짜 얼마 만에 사람들 앞에서 보여주는 진짜 내 모습이냐?” 전혀 연기 같지가 않다는 점. “내가 사실은 가면을 쓰고 살았다고. 얼추 몇 년간. 진짜 내 모습을 숨기고 지냈는데 사람들이 멋대로 착각하고 그러더라고?” 심지어 늘 장착했던 컨셉질도 벗겨진 상태였다. “여기 너희들도 그렇고 저- 기 뒤에 나랑 같이 온 대표까지도. 그냥 전부라 말해도 되지. 이제야 고백하네, 진짜 멋대로 상황이 흘러갔는데 어쩌다 보니 난 여기 있는 거라고. 이제 좀 속이 시원- 하네. 엉? 근데 다들 표정이 왜 그래? 안 믿는 눈친데? 지금껏 가면이었고 알맹이인 진짜 모습이 이거라니까?” 홀 안 모든 거물들의 얼이 빠졌다.","completion":"Episode 392: Smash (1) The overall producer of 'Pierrot,' who had a strong presence, explained that the audition method was simple. They would skip the designated acting and go for free acting, but the character they had to portray in that free acting was specified. The confirmed character was 'Henry Gordon,' the male lead of 'Pierrot.' The candidate actors gathered today could show any kind of performance or acting, and it was all OK. However, the packaging had to be 'Henry Gordon.' This was something that 'Columbia Studio' had not shared with the candidate actors beforehand. Therefore. \\"It's quite sudden.\\" The Hollywood actors didn't show it, but they were a bit dumbfounded. \\"I prepared so much for nothing. How can they change the rules so suddenly?\\" \\"Your voice is loud.\\" \\"But what I'm saying is true.\\" They had been told to prepare for designated and free acting, but the rules were suddenly changed, so it was understandable that they grumbled. \\"I didn't expect this. What now, should we mix what we've prepared?\\" \\"Focus. 'Columbia Studio' seems to want to see the actors' quick thinking.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" \\"It's not a problem, right? After all, 'Henry Gordon' was prepared as designated acting, and as you said, just add 'Henry Gordon' to your free acting.\\" \\"It's not as easy as you say. Anyway, keep it down, let me think.\\" This was the same for Chris Hartnett. Still, compared to other actors, he was relatively calm. \\"Chris, are you okay?\\" \\"I'm fine. No need to panic. I was a bit surprised, but this kind of thing happens often in Hollywood.\\" \\"That's true.\\" \\"In this case, it's better to be aggressive.\\" \\"What are you going to do?\\" Without answering his manager's question, Chris Hartnett suddenly turned his head to the left. He saw Kang Woojin, who was sitting a little distance away. Soon, Chris's eyes widened slightly. Woojin was too calm. Or perhaps, he looked indifferent with his chin propped up. '...Is he not bothered at all? Or does he have no particular thoughts? It's hard to gauge this man. What is he thinking? Hmm- But given the situation, he must be serious, just pretending not to be.' He was wrong. Currently, Kang Woojin was truly unconcerned. He didn't have many thoughts. 'So when are they starting this?' Whether it was designated or free acting, whether it was 'Henry Gordon' or not, it didn't matter to him. After all, both the designated acting and free acting he had prepared were 'Henry Gordon.' And even if there were any problems. -Swish. He had the 'Pierrot' script with a black square in his hand, so there was nothing to worry about. At this point. \\"It's a bit sudden.\\" The overall producer at the table on stage informed the actors. \\"We will start in 10 minutes.\\" This was not so much giving them a break as it was giving them time to take a deep breath. 10 minutes wasn't enough to make any significant preparations. In reality, the 10 minutes passed in an instant. Soon, the producer moved again. She checked the status of the monitors in front of her and then called one of the actors. \\"The order has been decided by us. Tom Brando. Please come up.\\" An actor with a decent build and a manly face rather than handsome stood up. His name was Tom Brando. He was a top actor famous for his acting in Hollywood. He too was dressed in a suit like 'Henry Gordon,' but the colors were monotonous. Gray, black, and brown were mixed. He didn't wear makeup. Tom Brando was the first to step onto the stage surrounded by cameras. -Swish. By the way, the stage wasn't just filled with cameras. In one corner, various props were laid out, and single-seat sofas and chairs were also available. It was up to the actors to use them. When Tom Brando stood in the middle of the stage, Director An Gabok's gaze, sitting at the judges' table, landed on the multi-view monitors. Full shots of the actor, front and side busts, and back views were displayed. Director An Gabok stroked his wrinkled cheek. 'Indeed, he's a top Hollywood actor. The aura captured by the camera is extraordinary.' Including the female producer, all the judges were looking at the monitors. The audition was important, but the screen test captured on the monitor was also crucial. Then the overall producer nodded to Tom Brando, who was standing on stage. \\"Whenever you're ready, you may begin.\\" As soon as she finished speaking, Tom Brando changed his expression and posture. He put one hand in his pocket and stood up straight. His face was slightly tilted. A faint smile hung on his lips. It seemed like he was showing the awakened latter half of 'Henry Gordon' from 'Pierrot.' The judges' faces were serious as they saw Tom Brando's transformation. 'He's an actor beyond reproach, and he's immediately transformed into what we want.' 'He changed the atmosphere in an instant. Is he trying to act as the Joker?' 'Yes, this is the image of 'Henry Gordon' in the latter half that I imagined.' The actor Tom Brando, known for his acting, looked around at the surrounding cameras and chuckled. \\"These damn gazes. They're all just scared and tense. Don't impose that on me. Your kindness is just a defense because you don't want to die, and I'm going to do what I want?\\" The words Tom Brando spat out. A 'Henry Gordon' that was no different from reality. There was no sense of incongruity. \\"Mental therapy? What's there to treat? Go fix your rotten brain.\\" Tom Brando, who was the first to audition, chose a straightforward approach. He was acting as 'Henry Gordon' from the 'Pierrot' script. Since it was free acting, it didn't matter. Besides, this might be an even more effective method. '...Good, he's doing as well as I expected.' 'He's performing the script, so I can picture the scene.' Tom Brando's free acting of the 'Pierrot' script, chosen by himself, gave the judges, including Director An Gabok, a feeling akin to an actual shoot. Since his acting was top-notch, the impact was doubled, and it satisfied the judges' fundamental curiosity. An unexpectedly aggressive choice. By being the first among the candidate actors to show a script performance, he established his position. Moreover. 'He chose a key scene.' The scene Tom Brando picked was one of high importance in the 'Pierrot' script. Therefore, it was more memorable. His performance lasted for over 10 minutes. No one spoke during it. The executives of 'Columbia Studio' in the audience looked very satisfied, and the Hollywood actors secretly wore expressions of crisis. The judges were busy writing something while looking at the monitors. Tom Brando's performance ended. \\"That's all for now.\\" He quickly shed the scent of 'Henry Gordon.' It felt slightly ahead of Woojin's pace, but it was a similar feeling. It was natural, given his over 20 years of experience. Tom Brando, who had a brief conversation with the judges, left the stage. The conversation didn't involve any evaluation. This wasn't a place to judge actors, but rather to decide which actor fit 'Henry Gordon' better. Anyway, the level of the audition rose significantly with the first actor's turn. \\"Next, Jack Gable.\\" The second top Hollywood actor was called. Jack Gable, who looked somewhat frail but had a chiseled jaw. He was an actor with an atmospheric mask, one of the top actors in Hollywood. Jack Gable also took the stage and showed a relaxed performance. He displayed a half-mad demeanor. \\"Hic! Hahaha. Ahhh- Huh!\\" Was he in a mental hospital? Crawling on the stage floor or suddenly shouting, Jack Gable was no different from a real madman. It was realistic and vivid. Moreover, from his deranged appearance. \\"Let go! Let me go!\\" 'Henry Gordon' was poignant. It was because he copied the mannerisms. The hunched back and shoulders, the way of speaking, the look in his eyes, and other subtle traits of 'Henry Gordon' from the script were easily embodied by Jack Gable. His level of acting was also beyond that of a veteran. Although different from the previous Tom Brando, he also displayed a strong presence. Director An Gabok alternated between looking at him on the monitor and on stage, feeling. 'I see, he's creating and showing the future of 'Henry Gordon.'' He was freely acting out the end of 'Henry Gordon' that wasn't expressed in the script, imagining and creating it himself. Both the previous Tom Brando and the current Jack Gable were beyond imagination. Director An Gabok was slightly confused. 'I was prepared, but it's a headache when everyone's level is so high.' Which monster should he choose among them? During Jack Gable's turn, the 8 executives of 'Columbia Studio' nodded in satisfaction. Over 20 key staff of 'Pierrot' also quietly admired. The expressions of the actors were ambiguous. They couldn't be happy to see their competitors doing well. But there was one. \\"······\\" The only actor in the hall whose expression didn't change. It was Kang Woojin. From the start of the audition until now, Woojin maintained a poker face without any tremors. He just watched the performances of the other actors with a firm face. Then. \\"Thank you for your effort.\\" Jack Gable's turn ended. He too had a brief conversation with the judges before leaving the stage. Seemingly satisfied with his performance, a smile appeared on Jack Gable's lips. Next. \\"The following-\\" The female producer among the judges, holding the profile of the next actor, turned her gaze to the audience. \\"Kang Woojin.\\" The third to be called was Kang Woojin. Immediately, the eyes of the Hollywood actors changed. Chris Hartnett and several actors turned to look at Woojin, who was sitting. The Hollywood actors' team members, the dozen key staff of 'Pierrot,' the executives of 'Columbia Studio' in the front row seats, and the judges on stage. Over 50 people in the hall were all staring at Kang Woojin. He was particularly hot and the least verified among the actors. Moreover, he was the actor who sparked the most intense curiosity. Ponytailed Choi Seong-gun exhaled a long breath. \\"Phew- this is nerve-wracking, Woojin-ah. Do well and come back.\\" He made a motion as if his heart was about to burst. In contrast, Kang Woojin was filled with calmness. \\"I'll be back.\\" He seemed too composed, almost cynical. Kang Woojin, in his red jacket and pants, yellow vest, and worn brown shoes, stood up leisurely. -Swish. It was the moment his first step began in the Hollywood lead role audition, but there was no sign of tension in Woojin's movements. He walked confidently towards the stage, and over 50 gazes in the hall followed him. The looks were varied: skepticism, doubt, expectation, curiosity, disregard, and many more. Ponytailed Choi Seong-gun swallowed hard. 'Ah- damn. My heart's going to burst. I trust Woojin will do well, but why am I so nervous?' He hadn't received any hints from Woojin on how to audition. But as always, Choi Seong-gun entrusted everything to Kang Woojin. Then, Kang Woojin with a calm face stepped onto the stage filled with cameras. Soon, Woojin appeared on the monitors at the judges' table, and Director An Gabok let out a tense breath without showing it. 'What kind of performance will he show this time?' It wasn't just him. The overall producer sitting next to Director An Gabok also thought. 'The Korean actor who has shaken Hollywood, let's see what kind of acting he has prepared.' The caddie, two executives, and the dozens of people in the audience. They all muttered similar words to Director An Gabok internally. 'Let's see what you've got.' But it wouldn't be easy, as the performances of the two previous Hollywood actors were so impressive. Anyway, as soon as Kang Woojin stepped onto the stage and appeared on the monitors, the overall producer was about to speak. However. \\"Huh?\\" She stopped. The reason was simple. -Swish. Woojin made an unexpected move. The previous Hollywood actors had all stood in the center of the stage when they came up. The place where all the cameras were focused. But now, Woojin brushed past the center of the stage as if he couldn't care less. He then arrived at a slightly secluded single-seat sofa and sat down without any prior mention. It was a no-brainer. As a result, the foreign staff attached to the cameras quickly turned them. Kang Woojin, who sat down on the single-seat sofa on his own, was being filmed by cameras from all sides. The picture had changed. Until now, the actors stood to be captured by the cameras, but now the entire camera setup was focused solely on filming Kang Woojin. The audition had turned into a one-man talk show. At that moment, Director An Gabok slightly furrowed his brow. '...Did he do this on purpose?' Conversely, the overall producer, Hollywood actors, and over 50 foreigners were puzzled. Half of them blinked their eyes. At that moment. \\"Ah-\\" While crossing his legs and capturing the attention of everyone in the hall and cameras like a protagonist. \\"Living with a mask is damn exhausting.\\" He began to spout fluent English. What stood out here was. \\"Should I start talking as the real me for a bit? Wow, how long has it been since I've shown my true self in front of people?\\" It didn't seem like acting at all. \\"I've actually been living with a mask. For a few years. I've been hiding my true self, and people have been misunderstanding me, you know?\\" Even the usual concept he always wore was stripped away. \\"Here, you guys, and even the representative who came with me behind the camera. Just everyone. I'm confessing now, things just went their own way, and somehow I ended up here. Now I feel a bit relieved. Huh? But why do you all look like that? You don't believe me? I'm telling you, I've been wearing a mask until now, and this is my real self.\\" Everyone in the hall was dumbfounded."},{"prompt":"translate to english","completion":"It seems like you wanted to provide text for translation, but there is no content to translate.

여전히 실감이 무디긴 한데······이곳에 서 있는 게 어렵진 않네.’ 어느새 이 정글 같은 연예계가 익숙하다는 것을 말이다. 대본 한 번 펼쳐보지 않던 소시민으로서 살던 게 어제 같은데, 지금은 이 웅장한 무대와 화려한 조명들 그리고 굉장한 배우들의 극찬이 어색하지 않았다. 적응된 것이겠지. 워낙에 많은 일을 헤쳐가며 달려왔으니까. 하지만 우진은 초심을 잃지 않았다. 알맹이가 따로 있는 그였기에 가능한 것. ‘그래도! 어후- 졸라 잘나가는 배우들 전부가 겁나 쳐다보니까 개민망하네, 이건 몇 년 더 지나야 익숙해질라나??’ 뭐랄까, 강우진에겐 국내 메이저 영화제가 칸보다 더 어색했다. 해외야 월드 스타고 글로벌 슈퍼 탑배우고 우진에겐 익숙지 않은 얼굴들이지만, 여긴 너무도 잘 아는 배우들이 천지에 널렸으니까. 과거 TV나 영화관에서나 보던 스타들이 지금은 강우진을 향해 격렬한 박수를 쏟아내는 중이었다. 허나 그럴수록 우진은 심지를 굳게 만들었다. 무대에 오르기 전까지, 무대에 오른 뒤에도 강우진의 포커페이스에는 전혀 흔들림이 없었다. 이를 본 수백 배우들은 감탄했다. “웃음기가 전혀 없네요, 우진씨. 청룡에서도 그랬죠?” “만족이 안 되는 건가?” “와- 최초로 칸에서 남우주연상 탄 뒤로, 쌍 2천만 영화로도 모자라 한 해 국내 남주상을 전부 싹 쓸었는데??” “우리랑 마인드가 아예 다른 거겠죠. 칸에서 남주상 탈 때도 우진씨는 저런 분위기였고.” 눈앞 외계인의 아우라가 새삼 경이로웠으니까. 불가능한 것들은 단 2년 만에 가능하게 했음에도. “뭔가······이런 걸 급이 다르다고 말하는 건가 싶기도 하네요.” “판타지지, 솔직히 눈으로 보고 있는데도 안 믿기는구만.” “이미 헐리웃을 가네 마네 하는 상황에 국내 트로피가 눈에 차겠어요?” 강우진은 지금 더 위를 바라보고 있는 모습이었으니까. 하지만 이는 착각이었다. 트로피와 꽃다발을 받은 뒤 스텐딩 마이크 앞에 선 강우진은, ‘하- 남주상 좋긴 한데, 겁나 단 거 땡긴다. 끝나고 뒤풀이는 걍 빤스런 해야지.’ 더 위를 바라보는 것 없이, 집에 튈 생각이 가득했으니까. 몇 시간 뒤. 강우진은 자정이 다 돼서야 집에 도착했다. 대종상이 끝난 뒤엔 당연하겠지만, 몰린 수백 기자들의 스포트라이트는 우진에게 집중됐다. 어마어마한 질문들과 플래시들. 그것들에 적당히 대응한 우진은 대종상과 bw 엔터 뒤풀이 모두에 참석하지 않고 바로 집에 복귀했다. 거실에 입성하자마자 기지개를 쭉 켜는 그. “끄으윽!!” 종일 장착했던 컨셉질은 사뿐히 지워냈다. 어느새 그의 얼굴엔 미소가 번졌다. 거실 쪽 선반에 나열된 트로피들을 보고 있었으니까. 방금 대종상의 남우주연상 트로피까지 추가하니 퍽 볼만했다. “몇 개냐 이게.” 훈장의 느낌이었다. 데뷔 직후 상을 수집한 강우진이었고, 작년엔 신인상과 조연상 포함 방송 쪽까지 8개가 넘었다. 올해는 작년보다 수는 부족해도 전부 메인인 주연상들뿐이었다. 이중 단연 빛나는 건 칸 영화제의 트로피. 곧, 우진이 어마무시하게 불어난 트로피들을 보며 팔짱 꼈다. 미소가 짙어지는 건 덤. “국내하고 칸은 제패했고- 이제 남은 건 진짜 헐리웃 쪽뿐인가?” 이미 터무니없는 결과를 만들어낸 우진이었지만 아직 최상위는 아니었다. 언제나 위에는 위가 있는 법. 세계적으로 최고 권위의 시상식들이 아직 남았다. 진짜 괴물들이 몰려드는 곳. 아직 미래를 장담할 순 없지만, 지금의 우진은 무엇이든 할 수 있을 것 같았다. “하던 대로, 응. 단순하게.” 혼잣말을 뱉은, 오늘 국내 최고의 배우로서 명확한 도장을 찍은 강우진이 몸을 돌렸다. 그리곤 여유 묻은 손짓으로 뭔가를 꺼냈다. “일단, 1사발부터 조지고.” 사발면이었다. 후로. 야식으로 사발면을 선택한 강우진이 뜨거운 물을 붓고 난 뒤 핸드폰을 들었다. “보자, 어떤가-” 현 언론의 상태가 궁금해서였다. 작년도 경험하긴 했지만 올해는 상황이 다르지 않은가? 당연하겠지만 인터넷은 연말+영화제 소식으로 난리법석이었다. 『2년 차에 칸, 청룡, 대종상 모두 남우주연상···강우진이 이룩한 유일무이한 행보』 『[스타포토]‘대종상’에서 ‘남우주연상’ 불린 강우진, 덤덤히 무대로/ 사진』 정확하게는 강우진의 독무대랄까? 『작년엔 신인상·조연상, 올해는 남우주연상 싹쓸이···강우진 내년엔 진짜 아카데미상 진출?』 우진이 황당무계한 기록을, 전설을 만들었기 때문이었다. 칸부터 국내 메이저 영화제의 남주상 독점. 거기다 사이사이 벌인 최초의 결과들까지. 이 모든 걸 고작 1년 안에 해냈으니 언론이 광분할 수밖에. 『‘역대 한국 영화’ 경신부터 ‘역대 한국배우’ 최초까지, ‘역대’가 어울리는 괴물 배우 강우진···올해도 수상소감으로 폭탄선언 잊지 않았다』 여론 쪽도 별반 다르지 않았다. 너튜브, SNS, 커뮤니티 등등등 어느 곳을 봐도 우진이 메인이었다. 그가 상을 받는 순간, 무던한 수상소감, 레드카펫을 유유히 걷는 모습, 올해도 잊지 않은 돌발 선포. 현재로선 강우진이 숨만 쉬어도 화제가 될 정도였다. 참고로. 『올해 연말은 ‘쌍 2천만’ 영화 ‘실종의 섬’과 ‘거머리’의 축하파티!』 올해 영화제는 모두가 예상했듯 ‘실종의 섬’과 ‘거머리’의 독주였다. 최우수 작품, 감독상, 각본상 외의 다수를 두 영화가 독식했다. 하지만 그 누구도 반기를 들지 않았다. 그럴 만한 성과를 넘어 한국 영화계의 역사를 새로 쓴 두 작품이니까. 물론, 그 중심엔 이제 3년 차에 접어들 강우진이 있었다. 한편. 국내 전체가 연말 또는 영화제 등으로 들썩거리고 있을 무렵, 한 영화 관련 대형 커뮤니티에선 다른 건으로 요동치고 있었다. -[야수와 미녀 실사화하는 거 찐이면 야수는 어케 만드냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋCG일라나??] -[헐리웃이면 진짜 야수 잡아다 배우시킬지도] -[걍 찌라시일수도 있는데 야수와 미녀 실사화하면 각색은 많이 안했음 좋겠음] -[아랫글 공감함 디즈니 실사화 망한 거 보면 각색 ㅈㄴ드가서 그럼] 며칠 전 돌연 떡밥이 던져진 ‘야수와 미녀’였다. 시발점은 LA에 거주하고 있는 한 네티즌의 글부터였다. ‘소문을 들었고, 야수와 미녀는 현재 실사화를 준비하고 있다’ 정도의 간단한 글이었다만, 뒤로 이 글엔 속된말로 어그로가 어마어마하게 끌렸다. 며칠간 불타오른 결과, 지금은 시시각각 올라오는 게시글 대부분이 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실사화 관련이었다. -[젭라...야수와 미녀 배우는 좀 싱크로율 지렸으면 좋겠땅] -[아니 아직 확정아니고 뇌피셜이라니깤ㅋㅋㅋ왜들 오피셜로 받아들임???] 물론, 헛소문 또는 잡소리일 가능성이 없진 않았지만, LA에 산다는 네티즌이 인증샷을 올리며 신뢰도를 높였다. 명함이었다. 본인이 헐리웃 쪽 영화 업계에서 일하고 있음을 증명한 것. -[헐리웃에서 소문 돈다는 거 인증했음ㅇㅇ] -[이래놓고 개소리였던 게 한두 번이냐?ㅋㅋㅋ] 퍽 핫한 주제로 떠오른 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실사화 건은 초반엔 기다 아니다로 불타다가, 현재는 전혀 다른 방향으로 흘러가는 중이었다. -[내ㅈ대로 해보는 야수와 미녀 가상 캐스팅안.JPG] 커뮤니티에 ‘야수와 미녀’ 실사화 관련 가상 캐스팅보드가 돌기 시작한 것. 워낙에 유명한 ‘야수와 미녀’였고, 다들 자신의 마음에 드는 헐리웃 포함 해외 배우들을 배역에 멋대로 붙이기 시작했다. 전혀 다른 배우들도 있었지만 겹치는 배우도 많았다. -[가상 캐스팅 봤는데ㅋㅋㅋ난 미녀 벨라에 마일리 카라 생각했는뎅] -[솔까 마일리 카라가 딱이긴 함ㅇㅇ 야수는 잭 페티퍼가 잘 어울림] -[마일리 카라보단 나탈리 테론이 쌉이지] -[ㄴㄴ야수는 근데 누가 잡아도 큰 문제는 없는데 미녀 벨라는 ㅅㅂ무조건 금발이어야 함] -[내 추억의 1등 애니가 실사화라니...가슴이 웅장해지네...빨리 나와라...] -[아니 확정 아니라고ㅋㅋㅋㅋ] ‘야수’역은 누가 어울린다, ‘미녀 벨라’ 역은 누가 딱이다. 가창력과 연기력이 겸비한 헐리웃 탑배우들이 거론됐다. 그중엔 마일리 카라도 자주 보였다. 허나 당연하겠지만 그 누구도 한국배우의 이름을 꺼내지 않았고 강우진도 마찬가지였다. -[아시아 배우는 아예 합류 못할라나??] -[ㅋㅋㅋㅋ마을사람1 같은 거로 출연할 수는 있을듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋ] 어떤 누가 예상할 수 있겠는가? ‘야수와 미녀’의 ‘야수’ 역에 극비로 강우진이 포함됐다는 걸 말이다. 예상, 추측 따위가 가능한 수준이 아니긴 했다. 애초 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’가 지금껏 제작한 실사화 영화엔 조연부터 그 아래 배역은 있긴 했어도, 단 한 번도 아시아 배우가 주연을 맡은 적이 없으니까. 여기서 재밌는 것은. -[지금 한국의 영화 커뮤니티에서 야수와 미녀가 실사화한다는 소문이 돌고 있던데?] -[에에에에?

강우진 때문인가,” “강우진이 일본어로 연기하겠지?” “당연하지 미친놈아, 예고편에서도 빤히 일본어로 대사 치는구만.” “존나 특이하긴 해. 개지리는 한국배우가 일본 영화 주연으로 나오는 거.” 곧 볼 영화를 기다리면서도 제각각 심정을 뱉기 바빴다. “이거 일본에서 2000만 넘었다매?” “응응, 2300만인가?” “미쳤네. 일본 애들 평도 좋아, 처음엔 욕도 엄청 먹은 거 같은데- 결과적으론 씹어먹은 거지.” “오빠 어제 강우진이 남주상 타고 소감 말한 거 봤어?” “기사로 본 듯.” “하- 강우진이 헐리웃 영화 찍는 거 빨리 보고 싶다.” 와중 몇몇이 블랙으로 치장한 롱패딩의 남자를 힐끔하긴 했으나 크게 신경 쓰지 않았다. 그와 비슷하게 혼자 온 사람도 있었고, 한창 겨울이라 마스크를 낀 것도 흔했으니까. 그렇게 몇십 분이 흘렀다. 상영관으로 통하는 곳의 모니터에 입장할 영화 타이틀이 떴다. -‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’/ 7관. 조조 영화였고, ‘낯기생’의 상영 첫 타임. 당연했다. 21일인 오늘은 ‘낯기생’이 정식 한국 개봉하는 첫날이니까. 이쯤 검은 롱패딩을 입은 남자가 홀로 상영관에 입장했다. 수백 관객석을 본 그가 작게 탄성을 뱉었다. “오-” 조조임에도 관객석 반 이상이 차 있었으니까. 약간 놀란 그는 이내 자신의 자리를 찾았다. 중간보다 앞쪽의 끝자리. 남자가 자리에 앉자마자 대형 스크린에 광고가 출력되기 시작했다. ‘낯기생’에 한국에 상영되기 직전이라는 뜻. 그 순간. -우우웅. 남자의 롱패딩 속 핸드폰이 울렸다. 무음으로 바꿀 생각으로 남자가 핸드폰을 꺼내 확인했다. 도착한 것은 톡이었다. -대표님: 우진아, 푹 쉬고 있냐?

Congratulations! Mr. Kang Woo-jin of 'Leech'!!\\" Kang Woo-jin, who stood up from his seat amidst the focus of numerous cameras, had a very calm face. Even when he was showered with handshakes and congratulations from fellow actors and officials around him, he remained the same. Woo-jin walked calmly onto the stage with a face heavy with indifference. \\"......\\" His mind was blank. His eyes dazzled. His ears rang. His throat was dry. Adrenaline exploded. A tingling spread through his hands and feet. His heartbeat quickened. His vision narrowed. However, his act was solid. By this point, Kang Woo-jin walking to the stage realized. \\"2 years - no, almost 3 years now. I, who knew nothing, have come this far. Best Actor? It still doesn't feel quite real... but standing here isn't hard.\\" It meant that he had become accustomed to this jungle-like entertainment industry. It felt like just yesterday he was a commoner who had never even opened a script, but now he was not out of place on this grand stage with its dazzling lights and the tremendous actors' rave reviews. He must have adapted. After all, he had come a long way through many challenges. But Woo-jin had not lost his initial resolve. It was possible because he was someone with substance. \\"Still! Ah, it's so embarrassing when all these famous actors are staring at me. How many more years will it take to get used to this??\\" Somehow, for Kang Woo-jin, domestic major film festivals felt more awkward than Cannes. Overseas, he was a world star and a global super top actor, surrounded by unfamiliar faces, but here, he was surrounded by well-known actors. Stars he used to see only on TV or in movie theaters were now pouring out vigorous applause for Kang Woo-jin. However, the more this happened, the firmer Woo-jin became. Until he got on stage, and even after he got on stage, there was no sign of wavering in Kang Woo-jin's poker face. Hundreds of actors who saw this admired him. \\"There's not a hint of a smile on your face, Woo-jin. It was the same at the Blue Dragon Awards, right?\\" \\"Are you not satisfied?\\" \\"Wow - after being the first to win Best Actor at Cannes, and not enough with a double 20 million viewership movie, you've swept all the domestic Best Actor awards this year??\\" \\"Our mindset must be completely different. Even when Woo-jin won Best Actor at Cannes, he had the same atmosphere.\\" The aura of an alien in front of them was once again awe-inspiring. Despite making the impossible possible in just 2 years. \\"It makes you wonder if this is what they call being on a different level.\\" \\"It's like a fantasy, honestly. Even seeing it with my own eyes, I can't believe it.\\" \\"Already in a situation where Hollywood is a possibility, would domestic trophies even catch your eye?\\" Kang Woo-jin was looking higher. However, this was a misconception. After receiving the trophy and bouquet, Kang Woo-jin stood in front of the standing microphone, \\"Ha- Best Actor is nice, but I'm really craving something sweet. After this, I'll just skip the after-party.\\" He was full of thoughts of going home, not looking any higher. A few hours later. Kang Woo-jin arrived home just before midnight. Naturally, after the Grand Bell Awards ended, hundreds of reporters' spotlights were focused on Woo-jin. Amidst the barrage of questions and flashes, Woo-jin, who responded appropriately, did not attend the after-parties of the Grand Bell Awards and BW Entertainment, and returned home directly. As soon as he entered the living room, he stretched out. \\"Ughh!!\\" He easily shed the act he had been wearing all day. A smile spread across his face as he looked at the trophies lined up on the shelf in the living room. It was quite a sight now that the Best Actor trophy from the Grand Bell Awards had been added. \\"How many are there?\\" It felt like a medal of honor. Kang Woo-jin, who had collected awards right after his debut, had over 8 last year, including Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor, spanning from film to television. This year, though fewer in number, they were all main awards for Best Actor. Among them, the Cannes Film Festival trophy shone the brightest. Soon, Woo-jin crossed his arms as he looked at the massively increased number of trophies. A deeper smile was a bonus. \\"I've conquered domestically and Cannes - now, is Hollywood the only thing left?\\" Woo-jin, who had already achieved absurd results, was not yet at the very top. There's always something higher. The world's most prestigious award ceremonies were still ahead. Places where real monsters gather. Although the future couldn't be guaranteed, the current Woo-jin felt like he could do anything. \\"Just keep it simple, as I've been doing.\\" Muttering to himself, Kang Woo-jin, who had clearly stamped his mark as the country's best actor today, turned around. Then, with a leisurely gesture, he took something out. \\"First, let's start with one bowl.\\" It was instant noodles. Later. After choosing instant noodles for a late-night snack, Kang Woo-jin poured hot water and then picked up his phone. \\"Let's see, how is it-\\" He was curious about the current state of the media. Although he had experienced it last year, this year was different, wasn't it? Naturally, the internet was in chaos with year-end and film festival news. \\"Kang Woo-jin's unique achievement of Best Actor at Cannes, Blue Dragon, and Grand Bell Awards in his second year...\\" \\"[Star Photo] Kang Woo-jin, called 'Best Actor' at the Grand Bell Awards, calmly walks to the stage / Photo\\" It was precisely Kang Woo-jin's solo stage? \\"Last year he swept Best New Actor and Best Supporting Actor, this year he swept Best Actor... Will Kang Woo-jin really advance to the Academy Awards next year?\\" Woo-jin had created an outrageous record, a legend. From monopolizing the Best Actor awards at Cannes to domestic major film festivals, plus the first-ever results in between. All this achieved in just under a year, so the media was bound to go wild. \\"From breaking 'all-time Korean movie' records to being the first 'all-time Korean actor', monster actor Kang Woo-jin... didn't forget to drop a bombshell in his acceptance speech this year either\\" Public opinion was no different. YouTube, SNS, communities, etc., wherever you looked, Woo-jin was the main topic. The moment he received the award, his unflappable acceptance speech, his leisurely walk on the red carpet, and his unexpected announcement this year as well. Currently, Kang Woo-jin was a hot topic just by breathing. By the way. \\"This year's year-end is a celebration party for the 'double 20 million' movies 'Island of the Missing' and 'Leech'!\\" As everyone expected, this year's film festival was dominated by 'Island of the Missing' and 'Leech'. The two films monopolized many awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. But no one raised an objection. They were two works that had not only achieved outstanding results but had rewritten the history of the Korean film industry. Of course, at the center was Kang Woo-jin, who was about to enter his third year. Meanwhile. While the entire country was buzzing with year-end or film festival news, a major film-related community was in turmoil over something else. \\"[If 'Beauty and the Beast' is really being made into a live-action, how will they create the Beast? CG??]\\" \\"[If it's Hollywood, they might actually cast a real beast as an actor]\\" \\"[Just rumors, but if 'Beauty and the Beast' is made into a live-action, I hope they don't change it too much]\\" \\"[Agree with the post below, Disney's live-action failures are because they changed too much]\\" A few days ago, a hot topic was suddenly thrown into the mix about 'Beauty and the Beast'. The starting point was a post from a netizen living in LA. \\"I heard a rumor, and 'Beauty and the Beast' is currently being prepared for live-action,\\" was the simple content of the post, but it attracted a tremendous amount of attention. After burning for a few days, most of the posts now being uploaded were related to the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast'. \\"[I saw the virtual casting for 'Beauty and the Beast' and I thought of Miley Cara for the role of Bella]\\" \\"[Honestly, Miley Cara is perfect, and Jack Pettyfer suits the Beast]\\" \\"[Natalie Theron is way better than Miley Cara]\\" \\"[No, no, the Beast can be anyone, but Bella must be a blonde]\\" \\"[My favorite childhood animation is becoming a live-action... my heart swells... hurry up and come out...]\\" \\"[It's not confirmed yet, lol]\\" While there were discussions about who would suit the role of the 'Beast' and who would be perfect for 'Bella', talented Hollywood top actors with both singing and acting skills were mentioned. Miley Cara's name also appeared frequently. However, of course, no one mentioned a Korean actor, and Kang Woo-jin was no exception. \\"[Will Asian actors not even be able to join??]\\" \\"[Lol, maybe they can appear as villager 1 or something]\\" Who could have predicted? That Kang Woo-jin was secretly included as a candidate for the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'. It wasn't something that could be guessed or speculated. After all, there had never been an Asian actor in a leading role in any live-action film produced by 'Walt Disney Pictures'. Interestingly. \\"[Right now, there's a rumor in Korea's film community that 'Beauty and the Beast' is being made into a live-action, is that true?]\\" \\"[Eh? Really??!]\\" \\"[I love 'Beauty and the Beast'! Is the live-action rumor really true??!]\\" \\"[There's no information in Hollywood articles, it seems like just a rumor]\\" The rumor of 'Beauty and the Beast' live-action spread from Korea to Japan. It was mostly on communities and SNS, and although it was more in the shadows than the spotlight, 'Beauty and the Beast' was also popular in Japan. The topic quickly attracted attention due to the nature of the work. However, Korea and Japan were just the beginning. Hollywood. That is, including LA in the United States. If the rumor was circulating in Korea and Japan, it meant it was already a hot topic in the US. Naturally, the scale was several times larger. Many American communities had already taken the 'Beauty and the Beast' live-action rumor as a given, and the virtual casting was rampant. \\"The role of the Beast must be Brad Depp, and the role of Bella must be Miley Cara. If it's not them, it won't work.\\" Of course, Korean actors were not mentioned at all. December 21st, early morning. A man in a long padded coat with a hat pulled down low entered a movie theater in Seoul. He also wore a mask, all in black. After getting off the elevator, the man checked the time on his phone and then... -Swish. He scanned the movie theater lobby. Despite being a weekday morning, there were quite a few people. There were roughly dozens of people just in the lobby, munching on popcorn or watching the ads on the big TV. \\"Wow, it's my first time seeing a Japanese movie.\\" \\"But doesn't this movie feel like it's not a Japanese movie? Maybe because of Kang Woo-jin,\\" \\"Kang Woo-jin will act in Japanese, right?\\" \\"Of course, you idiot, he's clearly speaking Japanese in the trailer.\\" \\"It's really unique. A killer Korean actor is the lead in a Japanese movie.\\" Even while waiting for the movie to start, they were busy expressing their feelings. \\"Did this movie surpass 20 million in Japan?\\" \\"Yeah, 23 million or something?\\" \\"That's crazy. The reviews in Japan are good too, it seems like they were initially criticized a lot - but in the end, they dominated.\\" \\"Did you see Kang Woo-jin win Best Actor yesterday and give his speech?\\" \\"I think I saw it in an article.\\" \\"Ah- I really want to see Kang Woo-jin in a Hollywood movie soon.\\" Meanwhile, a few glanced at the man in the black long padded coat, but no one paid much attention. There were others who came alone, and wearing a mask in the middle of winter was common. After a few dozen minutes. The title of the movie to be entered appeared on the monitor at the entrance to the screening room. -'Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' / Hall 7. It was a morning show, the first screening time of 'Strange Sacrifice'. It was expected. Today, the 21st, was the first official opening day of 'Strange Sacrifice' in Korea. At that moment, the man in the black long padded coat entered the screening room alone. Seeing the hundreds of seats, he let out a small exclamation. \\"Oh-\\" Despite being a morning show, more than half of the seats were filled. Slightly surprised, he soon found his seat. It was at the end, closer to the front. As soon as the man sat down, advertisements began to appear on the big screen. It meant that 'Strange Sacrifice' was about to be shown in Korea. At that moment. -Vrrrr. The phone inside the man's long padded coat vibrated. As he was about to silence it, he took out his phone to check. It was a message. -CEO: Woo-jin, are you resting well? I thought you might be sleeping, so I'm leaving a message. Columbia Studio just confirmed the date. -CEO: The audition and screen test are on January 25th, and we should leave around the 20th. The sender was CEO Choi Sung-gun. -CEO: Also, Disney sent an email. You're confirmed as a candidate actor for 'Beauty and the Beast'."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot continue the text as it appears to be from a copyrighted work.

[“A:헨리 고든/ 빌런 리딩 준비 중······”] 짧은 순간 강우진이 진지한 숨을 뱉었다. “후-” 뒤로 거대한 회색이 그를 덮쳤다. 몸이 기우뚱했다. ‘우웅’ 따위의 배기음이 들렸다. 암흑이던 시야가 점차 밝아졌다. 색감이 채워졌다. ‘헨리 고든’. 아니, 강우진의 얘기였다. 다시 덜컹했다. 몸이 기운다. 우진이 고개를 들었다. 허름한 버스였다. 좌석부터 창문까지 온통 낙서 투성인 버스. 밤의 도로를 달리는 버스 안에 강우진이 앉았다. 자리는 제일 뒤쪽. 우진의 시선이 다시 내려갔다. 입은 옷이 보였다. 애매했다. 정장인 듯하지만 튄다. 빨간 재킷과 바지, 노란 조끼, 헤진 갈색 구두. 매우 눈에 띄는 데다 누더기에 가까운 복장이지만 왜인지 우진은 아무렇지 않았다. 익숙했다. -스륵. 고개를 내리니 머리카락이 내려왔다. 옅게 벌건 색이었다. 심지어 귀를 덮는 장발. “······” 강우진이 무던하게 머리를 쓸었다. 젖어있다. 그러고 보니 이 버스 안은 조금 덥다. 뭐 어떤가? 즐기면 그만 아닌가? 서서히 우진의 심정에 주인의 감정이 깃든다. 혈관을 타고 온몸에 번졌다. 제일 먼저 떠오른 것은 광기였다. 행복과 환상이다. 낭만과 지옥이다. 온전과 혼돈이다. 정의와 불의다. 웃음과 울음이다. 사람과 광대다. 비극과 희극이다. 너희들은 비극이요, 나는 희극이다. 점차 우진에게 차오르는 것들은 이름 모를 것들이었다. 그렇다고 이걸 비정상으로 치부할 수 있는가? 변종이라 말할 수 있는가? 엿이나 먹으라지. 강우진에겐 뜨거움과 차가움이, 불행과 행복이 공존했다. 웃을 수 있다. 정말이었다. 우진은 눈에 보이는 모든 것이 즐거웠다. 왜 이럴까. 왜 이렇게 심장이 뛸까. 마치 심장과 뇌에 주사로 희열을 박은 것 같다. 춤이라도 출까? 이때였다. -끼익! 버스가 비명을 지르며 멈췄다. 곧, 건들거리는 남자들 넷이 탔다. 그들은 서로 장난을 치다가 버스 제일 뒤에 탄 우진을 발견했다. 강우진은 그들을 보며 고개를 반쯤 꺾었다. 처음 남자들은 움찔했으나 이내 우진의 얼굴을 보며 낄낄댔다. “이 자식 얼굴 좀 봐!” “멍청한 놈! 정신이 나갔나 본데?” “크크, 어이! 춤춰 봐! 재롱을 떨어 보라고!” 남자들이 우진의 주변에 앉아서는 툭툭 건들었다. 강우진은 이 순간에도 강렬한 전율을 느끼고 있었다. 하지만 남자들은 미소짓는 우진이 못마땅한 듯. “야 내 말 무시해?” “몇 대 맞으면 움직이겠지.” 툭툭 건드리던 손이 거칠어졌다. 그러나 우진은 그들의 힘에 몸을 맡긴 채 흔들거리다가 돌연. “흐으-” 오른쪽에 앉은 남자의 얼굴 바로 앞에 자신의 면상을 붙였다. 그리곤 입이 찢어져라 웃었다. 짜증이 잔뜩 난 남자가 주먹으로 우진의 얼굴을 갈겼다. 바닥에 엎어지는 강우진. 그러나 그의 웃음은 격렬해졌다. “크크크큭!” 미간을 팍 좁힌 남자들이 우진을 발로 밟았다. 어욱, 으윽 따위의 신음은 내지만 강우진의 웃음은 점차 더 커졌다. “크크크! 하하하! 하하하하하!” 이쯤, 남자들이 발길질을 멈추곤 바닥에 누운 강우진을 보며 작게 읊조렸다. “이, 이런 미친 자식.” 입꼬리가 귀에 걸린 강우진이 양팔을 벌려 그들에게 말했다. “뭐해, 더 하라고.” 남자들이 서로의 얼굴을 보다가 버스 뒷문을 두드렸다. “문 열어!! 어이! 기사! 문 열라고!!” -끼익! 버스가 멈췄다. 남자들이 도망치듯 버스에서 내려 달렸다. 곧, 뚱뚱한 버스 기사가 슬쩍 다가와선 엎어진 우진에게 조심스레 물었다. “이봐, 괜찮나?” 우진은 여전히 웃고 있었다. 버스 기사가 움찔하며 다시 말했다. “다, 당신 얼굴이 그러니까 시비가 걸리는 거라고.” 작게 숨을 뱉은 강우진이 천천히 일어났다. 그리곤 앞에 선 버스 기사를 가만히 보다가. “헤-” 웃음과 함께 혀를 쭉 내밀었다. 버스 기사가 질린 듯 운전석으로 도망친다. “미쳤구만!” 이어 우진이 버스 창문에 비치는 자신을 바라봤다. “······” 옅게 벌건 머리, 하얗게 칠해진 얼굴, 뾰족하면서도 빨간 사각형이 그려진 두 눈, 마찬가지로 쭉 찢어진 웃음처럼 발린 두터운 입술 그림. 끔찍한 ‘삐에로’ 그 자체였다. “미쳤다니, 극찬인걸?” 이 이야기는 빌런의 탄생기였다.","completion":"Episode 385: Overwhelming (14) The official announcement of the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' by 'Walt Disney Pictures' caused a stir. \\"BBX/'Walt Disney Pictures' Officially Announces 'Beauty and the Beast' Live-Action Film Production\\" Foreign media quickly churned out similar yet slightly different articles in a frenzy. \\"LA TIME/Beauty and the Beast Live-Action Production? Will Disney Succeed This Time?\\" It was news worth the excitement. Hollywood was already keen on the 'Big Five' movie studios, and 'Walt Disney Pictures' in particular was always a hot topic due to its large original fandom. In other words, articles about live-action announcements by 'Walt Disney Pictures' sold well because of the fanbase. It had always been the case. Whether live-action adaptations were a flop or a hit, news of 'Walt Disney Pictures' turning an original animation into live-action always stirred up fans worldwide. It was clear that one of their flagship works, 'Beauty and the Beast,' would be no different. \\"CNM/Disney Announces Live-Action Film of One of Its Flagship Works, Beauty and the Beast!\\" The articles released by foreign media quickly attracted the attention of people from many countries. -Oh my gosh! Beauty and the Beast is getting a live-action version??! -If it's going to be a half-hearted effort like last time, don't bother, Disney! -The rumors were true!! -I'm excited but also worried, why is that? -Bella! Will we be able to see Bella in real life? -Disney! This is a work that holds my memories, don't ruin it, or you'll pay. -How will they create the Beast? CG again? The languages were diverse. This proved the wide-ranging fandom of 'Beauty and the Beast.' Despite the global interest, 'Walt Disney Pictures' seemed to indicate this was just the beginning and made another move exactly two hours after the live-action announcement. 'Walt Disney Pictures' posted another update on their official SNS about the current situation. -[Hello! This is Walt Disney Pictures! Thank you for your interest in the live-action Beauty and the Beast. We have confirmed the male actor for the role of 'Beast' and the female actor for the role of 'Bella' and will soon be entering screen tests...] The post was quite long, but in summary, it said, \\"We have confirmed the main actors and will reveal them to the fans before the auditions and screen tests.\\" This meant that 'Walt Disney Pictures' had been working on this secretly, and the SNS post quickly received comments in many languages from around the world. -What! The candidate actors are already confirmed? Who are they? -Bella has to be blonde! Cast Miley Cara. -I'm curious about the lineup of actors, when will the candidates be announced? -There have been virtual casting boards going around, maybe it will be similar? -It will be actors who can both sing and act, right? -Disney, make sure to match the synchronization properly! · · 'Clown' was certainly not weak, but 'Beauty and the Beast' had more firepower due to the original work's power. Was it a difference in imagination? 'Clown' was still an unknown work, but 'Beauty and the Beast' had an original, allowing fans to have even more explosive imaginations. Regardless, the issue of 'Beauty and the Beast' heated up various places overseas towards the end of the year. Of course, this was also true in Asia. In Japan. \\"Live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' film production confirmed, curiosity about candidate actors spreads!\\" And in Korea. -\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is being made into a live-action? My own casting board for the issue that's shaking the world!! | MovieBro TV The domestic media did not cover this matter noisily. However, it was significant enough to make it to the main topics of foreign discussions, and public opinion, especially on SNS and communities, was abuzz. Naturally, Kang Woo-jin was also aware of this situation. \\"Wow- the hype is insane!\\" Perhaps because it was around Christmas, it felt even more powerful. While 'Beauty and the Beast' was bulking up its issue in both overseas and domestic markets, December was coming to an end. The next morning, at Kang Woo-jin's house. Around 5 a.m., Kang Woo-jin groggily got out of bed. After staring blankly into space for a few seconds, he twisted his head left and right and picked up the phone lying nearby. As he yawned widely, numbers appeared on the phone screen. \\"Hoo-\\" He sighed softly. The reason was simple. -[2022/ 1/ 1/ Saturday] The new year had begun, and Kang Woo-jin was now in his third year. Afterward. 2021 came to an end, and 2022 dawned. Two days flew by in a flash. It was now Monday, January 3rd. Of course, quite a lot had happened in the meantime. 'Beauty and the Beast,' which had become an issue both overseas and domestically due to the confirmation of the live-action and candidate actors, raised expectations again by announcing additional directors and key staff. However, the list of confirmed candidate actors was still pending. Not to be outdone, 'Clown' also formalized the decided audition and screen test dates, drawing attention. Of course, Kang Woo-jin was also hot news related to 'Clown.' \\"'Clown' Audition, Screen Test on the 25th... When will Kang Woo-jin depart?\\" With less than three weeks left until the 20th, domestic media and public opinion were frantically advocating Kang Woo-jin's Hollywood debut as soon as the new year began. If Woo-jin landed the male lead role in 'Clown,' he would become the first Korean actor to take on a Hollywood lead role. In the meantime, 'Columbia Studio' had passed on audition materials to Kang Woo-jin. These included the official 'Clown' script and audition excerpts and explanations. In summary, the 'Clown' audition and screen test required preparation for both designated and free acting. The comment that props and makeup were up to the actor was a bonus. However, Kang Woo-jin, who was on the move early in the morning, was not greatly disturbed. \\"The snow is really coming down-\\" During the schedule move, he was simply observing the heavy snowfall outside the car window. There was no real problem. Even with the new year, his strong act was still contributing. To him. \\"Woo-jin.\\" Choi Sung-gun, with his ponytail grown a bit longer, showed him a tablet. He had just finished compiling something he needed to inform Woo-jin about. What he showed was the current situation of the movies 'Strange Sacrifice' and 'Leech.' Both films had been released for about two weeks and had taken charge of the box office during the last year-end and the new year. Even more so. \\"At this rate - both 'Strange Sacrifice' and 'Leech' seem likely to surpass 10 million viewers, and especially 'Strange Sacrifice' might even catch up to 'Naval Battle'.\\" He was referring to 'Naval Battle,' which ranked third in the all-time Korean movie rankings. For reference, first place was 'Leech' and second place was 'Island of the Missing.' If 'Strange Sacrifice' took third place, it meant Kang Woo-jin's movies would occupy the top three spots. An absurd situation that seemed impossible was now within reach. Ponytail Choi Sung-gun was naturally tense. \\"Hoo... If this happens - it's going to be really amazing.\\" Woo-jin replied in a low voice. \\"It would be nice if it happens, but it's okay if it doesn't.\\" \\"Really?! For real??\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Come on, such a record-breaking opportunity is right in front of us! Aren't you disappointed?! Any other actor would have a heart attack in this situation!\\" \\"Is that so?\\" Woo-jin spoke calmly, but contrary to his stiff exterior, his inner thoughts were the opposite. 'Please! Please! Let 'Strange Sacrifice' take third place! Please! If it takes third, huh? First, second, third - all my movies!' The substantial Kang Woo-jin was also fervently praying. However, unable to reveal such frivolity, he... -Swish. Maintained his poker face and reached out his hand. He picked up one of the scripts/scenarios piled around him. Lately, he had been frequently looking at 'Clown.' The audition and screen test were just around the corner. As Woo-jin picked up the scenario, Choi Sung-gun closed his mouth. The other team members did the same. They couldn't disturb Kang Woo-jin's scenario reading. Then Woo-jin. -Swish. He pressed a black square attached next to the 'Clown' scenario. He immediately entered a void space. As soon as he arrived in the endlessly dark place, Kang Woo-jin moved towards a floating white square. Of course, he chose 'Clown.' -[11/Scenario (Title: Clown), EX+ Grade] -[*The movie scenario is of very high quality. 100% reading is possible.] Woo-jin had already completed reading the 'Clown' scenario several times. He was also executing recent readings (experiences) whenever he had time, including the male protagonist and other roles. Unlike the past, many abilities had been added to Woo-jin thanks to the void space, but repeating readings (experiences) still made the roles more vivid. Soon. \\"Let's see-\\" The roles from 'Clown' appeared before Woo-jin's eyes. -[You have selected the scenario (Title: Clown).] -[Listing characters available for reading (experience).] -[A: Henry Gordon/Villain, B: Robert Franklin, C: Detective Alex...] Familiar names appeared. Among them, Kang Woo-jin chose the role of 'Henry Gordon/Villain.' He was also the protagonist of 'Clown.' Soon, a robotic female voice echoed throughout the void space. [\\"A: Henry Gordon/Villain reading preparation in progress...\\"] For a brief moment, Kang Woo-jin exhaled a serious breath. \\"Hoo-\\" A massive grayness engulfed him. His body tilted. A sound like 'woong' of an exhaust was heard. The dark view gradually brightened. Colors filled in. It was the story of 'Henry Gordon.' No, it was Kang Woo-jin's story. The bus jolted again. His body leaned. Woo-jin lifted his head. It was a shabby bus. From the seats to the windows, the bus was covered in graffiti. Kang Woo-jin sat inside the bus driving through the night. His seat was at the very back. Woo-jin's gaze dropped again. He saw the clothes he was wearing. They were ambiguous. They looked like a suit but stood out. A red jacket and pants, a yellow vest, worn brown shoes. The outfit was very eye-catching and almost ragged, but for some reason, Woo-jin didn't mind. It was familiar. -Swish. As he lowered his head, his hair fell forward. It was a light shade of red. Even his long hair covered his ears. \\"......\\" Kang Woo-jin casually brushed his hair. It was wet. Looking around, the bus was a bit warm. But what of it? Isn't it enough to enjoy it? Gradually, the owner's emotions seeped into Woo-jin's feelings. It spread throughout his body via his veins. The first thing that came to mind was madness. Happiness and illusion. Romance and hell. Wholeness and chaos. Justice and injustice. Laughter and tears. Man and clown. Tragedy and comedy. You are the tragedy, and I am the comedy. What gradually filled Woo-jin were nameless things. But could this be dismissed as abnormal? Could it be called a mutation? Eat this, why don't you. Kang Woo-jin felt both warmth and coldness, misfortune and happiness coexisting. He could laugh. Truly. Everything Woo-jin saw was enjoyable. Why is this? Why does my heart beat like this? It's as if ecstasy was injected into my heart and brain. Shall I dance? It was then. -Screech! The bus screamed to a halt. Soon, four rowdy men boarded. They were joking with each other but then noticed Woo-jin sitting at the back of the bus. Kang Woo-jin tilted his head halfway as he looked at them. Initially, the men flinched, but then they giggled upon seeing Woo-jin's face. \\"Look at this guy's face!\\" \\"Stupid guy! Has he lost his mind?\\" \\"Hey, dance for us! Show us some tricks!\\" The men sat around Woo-jin and poked him. Even at this moment, Kang Woo-jin was feeling an intense thrill. However, the men seemed displeased with Woo-jin's smiling face. \\"Hey, are you ignoring me?\\" \\"A few punches should get him moving.\\" Their poking hands became rougher. But Woo-jin, letting his body go with their force, suddenly... \\"Huh-\\" He brought his face right in front of the man sitting to his right and laughed with his mouth wide open. Annoyed, the man punched Woo-jin in the face. Kang Woo-jin fell to the floor, but his laughter intensified. \\"Kekekekek!\\" The men, with furrowed brows, stepped on Woo-jin. He groaned, but Kang Woo-jin's laughter grew louder. \\"Kekeke! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!\\" At this point, the men stopped kicking and looked down at Kang Woo-jin lying on the floor, murmuring softly. \\"This, this crazy bastard.\\" Kang Woo-jin, with the corners of his mouth reaching his ears, spread his arms and spoke to them. \\"What are you doing, keep going.\\" The men looked at each other and knocked on the back door of the bus. \\"Open the door!! Hey! Driver! Open the door!!\\" -Screech! The bus stopped. The men ran out of the bus as if fleeing. Soon, the chubby bus driver cautiously approached and asked Woo-jin, who was lying down. \\"Hey, are you okay?\\" Woo-jin was still laughing. The bus driver flinched and spoke again. \\"Yo, your face is like that, and that's why you're getting into trouble.\\" Kang Woo-jin exhaled softly and slowly got up. Then he looked at the bus driver standing in front of him and... \\"Heh-\\" He laughed and stuck out his tongue. The bus driver, looking disgusted, ran to the driver's seat. \\"He's crazy!\\" Then Woo-jin looked at his reflection in the bus window. \\"......\\" Light red hair, a face painted white, sharp red squares drawn around his eyes, and thick lips painted to look like a wide smile. He was the spitting image of a terrible 'clown.' \\"Crazy, you say? That's quite the compliment.\\" This story was the origin of a villain."},{"prompt":"388화 압도 (17) 송만우 PD의 말에 가장 빠른 반응은 최나나 작가였다. “예엑?!!” 눈을 동그랗게 뜨며 놀란 것. 물론, 김소향 총괄디렉터나 넷플렉스 직원들도 같았다. “저, 정말요?” “지금 볼 수 있는 겁니까??” “와- 생각도 못 했는데.” 픽 웃은 턱수염 송만우 PD가 장난스레 답했다. “예, 왜요? 싫으신가? 그럼 말고.” 화들짝 한 최나나 작가가 먼저 달려들었고. “에에에! 아니요!! 보고 싶어요!” 결과적으로는 모두 동의. 충분히 그럴 만했다. 최나나 작가는 자신의 대본이 현실에서 구축된 일부분을 볼 수 있었고, 넷플렉스 코리아는 사활을 건 ‘이로운 악’의 일부분을 구경할 기회니까. 곧, 모두는 송만우 PD의 안내에 따라 DM 프로덕션 내에 있는 커다란 편집실에 모였다. 많은 모니터와 기기들, 약간은 어둑한 분위기의 편집실엔 편집 기사들 여럿이 앉아 있었고. -스윽. 중간 의자에 송만우 PD가 앉았다. 최나나 작가나 김소향 외의 십 수명은 송만우 PD의 뒤쪽에 섰다. 편집실이 큰 편이라 모두가 서는 것엔 무리가 없었다. 이내 편집 기기들을 조작하던 송만우 PD가. -스윽. 정면에 달린 여러 모니터 중 가장 큰 것을 가리켰다. “이쪽에서 나옵니다.” 그의 손끝을 따라 모두의 시선이 움직였고, 송만우 PD가 몇 번 조작하자 모니터엔 영상이 출력되기 시작했다. 정확하게는 강우진이. ‘이로운 악’의 ‘장연우’가 나왔다. 허름한 건물 안, 케이블 타이로 포박된 그. 즉, 지금 송만우 PD가 튼 것은 방콕에서 찍었던 10분 이상의 롱테이크 씬이었다. 세계를 노릴 ‘이로운 악’의 초반 핵심이 될 부분. 그리고. -[“탕탕탕탕!!”] 모니터 속 강우진이 본격적으로 움직이기 시작하자마자. “와······” “워-” “···미쳤네.” “허-” 맛보기 영상을 보던 최나나 작가나 김소향 외의 모두가 저도 모르게 탄성을 뱉었다. 모두 눈을 모니터에 고정한 채 뗄 생각조차 못 했다. 당연했다. “이, 이게 현장에서 볼 때랑은···전혀 느낌이 딴판인 거 같은데.” 지금 보는 영상이 어처구니없을 만큼 기가 막혔으니까. 현란과 화려함이 가득한, 방콕 현장에서 보던 것과는 느낌이 판이한 결과물이 생생하게 출력되고 있었다. 그 모든 것의 핵심이 되는 것은 역시. “진짜······우진님 대존멋.” ‘장연우’로서 활개 친 강우진이었다. 그의 액션, 그의 CQC, 그의 연기가 모니터 속에 가득했고 모두의 혼을 사로잡았다. 거기에 송만우 PD의 뼈를 갈아 넣은 연출까지 붙으니 입을 쩍 벌릴 수밖에. 이때 넷플렉스 코리아의 수장인. “이게 무슨-” 지금껏 국내외 수많은 컨텐츠들을 확인했던 김소향 총괄디렉터가 저도 모르게 읊조렸다. “내 예상보다 퀄이 몇 배는 더 잘 나왔잖아?” 홀린 것과 같았다. 10일, LA. 헐리웃 역시 한국과 다르지 않게 새해 분위기가 물씬 풍기고 있었다. 이 시기에 맞춰 개봉할 영화들의 홍보 또는 제작 확정 소식이 자주 들렸다. 하지만 역시 현재 헐리웃에 가장 대두되는, 외신이 자주 다루는 작품은 두 개가 강세였다. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 ‘삐에로’와 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’의 ‘야수와 미녀’였다. 과연 헐리웃의 ‘빅파이브’라 불리는 초대형 영화사들인가? 두 영화사는 작품 제작 확정 소식을 알린 뒤 작정하고 힘을 싣고 있었다. 최근 공식 오디션·스크린 테스트 날을 알린 ‘삐에로’쪽은. 『LA TIME/‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 ‘삐에로’, 프리프로덕션 현장 사진 공개!』 『CNM/아직 영화 내용 발표 안 한 ‘삐에로’, 대신에 안감복 감독에 이에 힘 좋은 키스탭들 합류 알렸다』 『BBX/다가오는 ‘삐에로’ 공개 오디션! 후보 배우 중 유일한 한국 배우 강우진, 헐리웃의 시선이 그에게 집중됐다』 배우, 세트, 프리 프로덕션 진행 상황 등을 쉴새 없이 알리며 본격적인 초반 마케팅에 돌입했다. 그럴수록 ‘삐에로’란 영화에 궁금증이 증폭됐다. 작품 타이틀, 감독, 후보 배우까진 공개됐으나 영화 내용은 전무했으니까. 다만, 이쯤 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’는 세상에 영화 내용 대신 다른 것을 알렸다. 공식 SNS를 통해서였다. -[······이번 ‘삐에로’는 우리 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 기획한 대형 프로젝트의 시작이 될 영화가 될 겁니다.] 떡밥을 뿌렸다. 그 프로젝트가 뭔지는 모르나 어쨌든 ‘삐에로’가 시발점이 될 거란 얘기. 반면, ‘삐에로’와는 달리 ‘야수와 미녀’는 살짝 조용했다. 실사화 확정과 남녀 주연 후보 배우가 정해졌다는 소식 뒤론 전무했다. 하지만 그럴수록 해외 언론과 여론은 더 불타올랐다. 『NT‘야수와 미녀’ 실사화 확정 이후 조용한 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’, 세계적으로 사랑받는 캐릭터는 어떤 배우가 맡게 되나』 『ABY/SNS부터 커뮤니티까지, 심지어 인터넷 방송에서도 횡횡한 ‘야수와 미녀’ 가상 캐스팅보드! 가장 현실성 있는 것은?』 특히, 미국 포함 세계 전체의 대중들이 난리였다.

Of course, General Director Kim So-hyang and the Netflix staff were equally astonished. \\"Really?\\" \\"Can we see it now??\\" \\"Wow, I never even thought of that.\\" Producer Song Man-woo, with his bearded chin, chuckled and playfully responded. \\"Yes, why? Don't you want to? Then forget it.\\" Writer Choi Na-na was the first to rush forward, flustered. \\"No, no! I want to see it!\\" Eventually, everyone agreed. It was well justified. Writer Choi Na-na could see a part of her script come to life, and Netflix Korea had the opportunity to glimpse a part of 'The Beneficial Evil,' a project they were staking their lives on. Soon, everyone gathered in a large editing room within DM Production, following Producer Song Man-woo's lead. In the editing room, with its many monitors and slightly dim atmosphere, several editors were seated. -Swish. Producer Song Man-woo took a seat in the middle chair. Writer Choi Na-na, General Director Kim So-hyang, and about a dozen others stood behind Producer Song Man-woo. The editing room was spacious enough to accommodate everyone standing. Producer Song Man-woo then operated some editing equipment. -Swish. He pointed to the largest monitor among several in front of him. \\"It will appear on this one.\\" Following his gesture, everyone's gaze shifted, and as Producer Song Man-woo made a few manipulations, an image began to appear on the monitor. Specifically, it was Kang Woo-jin. 'Jang Yeon-woo' from 'The Beneficial Evil' appeared. Inside a shabby building, bound with cable ties. In other words, what Producer Song Man-woo had just played was the long-take scene of over 10 minutes shot in Bangkok. A crucial early part of 'The Beneficial Evil,' which would target the world. And then. -[“Bang bang bang bang!!”] As Kang Woo-jin in the monitor began to move in earnest. \\"Wow...\\" \\"Whoa-\\" \\"That's insane.\\" \\"Huh-\\" Writer Choi Na-na and everyone else watching the preview video involuntarily gasped. They were all fixated on the monitor, unable to look away. It was understandable. \\"This, this feels completely different from watching it on set...\\" The video they were watching was unbelievably impressive. The result was a vivid display of dazzling and flamboyant action, a stark contrast to what they had seen on the Bangkok set. At the heart of it all was, of course. \\"Really... Woo-jin is so cool.\\" It was Kang Woo-jin, who soared as 'Jang Yeon-woo.' His action, his CQC, his acting filled the monitor and captivated everyone's souls. With Producer Song Man-woo's painstaking direction added to it, they couldn't help but be awestruck. At that moment, the head of Netflix Korea. \\"What is this-\\" General Director Kim So-hyang, who had seen countless contents both domestically and internationally, murmured without realizing it. \\"My expectations were exceeded by several times in terms of quality.\\" She seemed enchanted. January 10th, LA. Hollywood was also immersed in the New Year atmosphere, just like Korea. Promotions for movies to be released during this period or news of confirmed productions were frequent. However, currently, the two most prominent works in Hollywood, often covered by foreign media, were strong. 'Columbia Studio's 'Clown' and 'Walt Disney Pictures' 'Beauty and the Beast.' Indeed, were they the 'Big Five' of Hollywood, the mega movie studios? Both studios were putting their weight behind the production announcements of their films. 'Clown,' which had recently announced its official audition and screen test dates. \\"LA TIME/'Columbia Studio's 'Clown,' Pre-production Set Photos Revealed!\\" \\"CNM/'Clown' Hasn't Announced Movie Details Yet, Instead Announced Director An Gabok and Key Staff Joining\\" \\"BBX/Upcoming 'Clown' Public Audition! Kang Woo-jin, the Only Korean Actor Among the Candidates, Attracts Hollywood's Attention\\" The actors, sets, and pre-production progress were continuously announced, kicking off the early marketing campaign. As a result, curiosity about the film 'Clown' intensified. The title of the work, the director, and the candidate actors had been revealed, but the content of the movie was still unknown. However, at this point, 'Columbia Studio' announced something else to the world instead of the movie content. It was through their official SNS. -[...This 'Clown' will be the start of a major project planned by our 'Columbia Studio.'] They dropped a teaser. Although the nature of the project was unknown, it was clear that 'Clown' would be the starting point. On the other hand, unlike 'Clown,' 'Beauty and the Beast' was slightly quieter. There had been no news since the confirmation of the live-action and the announcement of the male and female lead candidates. But the quieter it was, the more the foreign media and public opinion flared up. \\"NT After the Confirmation of 'Beauty and the Beast' Live-Action, 'Walt Disney Pictures' Remains Quiet, Which Actors Will Take on the World-Famous Characters?\\" \\"ABY/From SNS to Communities, Even Internet Broadcasts Are Dominated by 'Beauty and the Beast' Virtual Casting Boards! Which Is the Most Realistic?\\" Especially, the general public from the United States and around the world was in an uproar. They endlessly discussed 'Beauty and the Beast' on SNS and communities, in various languages. Most of the buzz was about the actors who would be cast, filled with anticipation or concern. This was similar in Korea. -Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney... I really hope they make it well... -There are so many virtual castings for Beauty and the Beast on foreign communities lol, but they do fit well -I don't care about anything else, Disney, you better not screw up my Bella, got it? -Looking at the virtual casting, most of the actors have musical abilities lol, I'm voting for Miley Cara -Riley is also mentioned a lot for the role of Bella -Yeah, yeah, overseas singers are also said to be possible -Disney!!

I trust you???????? -↑You trust Disney? lololololol -Honestly, it seems okay whoever becomes the Beast, but Bella needs to be perfectly cast -The Beast can't just be anyone lol, it has to be a handsome actor -Plus, in the second half, the Beast turns into a prince, so he has to be handsome -And the Beast needs to be amazing at piano and vocals, right? -If they can play piano, sing, and act, and roar, it's perfect · · · · Two days passed like this. January 12th, Wednesday. The location was Stage 7 inside 'Columbia Studio' in LA. Inside 'Columbia Studio,' which resembled a city in its own right, there were over 20 stages, each as large as a massive set. Among these stages, a familiar film team was seen on Stage 7. At least thirty foreigners and an old Korean man among them. It was Director An Gabok. 'Clown' had officially entered the pre-production phase, and Director An Gabok was currently inspecting the set with the key shooting staff. Director An Gabok, along with several foreign key staff, was discussing various aspects of the set. However, there was a change in his mood. His wrinkled face showed a certain resolve. The process of changing 'Clown' to 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain' was also included. The initial phase was not light, but after hearing about 'Columbia Studio's' grand project, it felt even heavier. That's why executives and officials from 'Columbia Studio' frequently visited the stage. But Director An Gabok didn't particularly care. He was just focused on the task at hand. Anyway, the conversation he was having with the key staff was clearly about the set construction. He was holding the 'Clown' script in his hand. First, they had to divide the set shooting and location shooting before the official shooting continuity was ready. 'Clown' had many set shots in the script, but there were also location (outdoor) shots. They had to start by dividing them. It was then. \\"Director!\\" A young Asian man approached quickly from a distance. He was the assistant director from the Korean team brought by Director An Gabok. The foreign key staff of 'Clown' looked at the assistant director, and Director An Gabok, slightly furrowing his brow, turned his head. \\"Why the fuss?\\" The assistant director quickly joined Director An Gabok, surrounded by foreign staff, and spoke to him in Korean. \\"Di, Director. Have you seen the post 'Walt Disney Pictures' just uploaded on their official SNS?\\" \\"'Walt Disney Pictures'? No. Why suddenly them?\\" The startled assistant director showed his phone and replied. \\"The confirmed candidate actors for 'Beauty and the Beast' have been announced - for the 'Beast' role...\\" \\"What about the 'Beast' role?\\" Director An Gabok, seemingly impatient, snatched the assistant director's phone. The phone screen displayed the official SNS of 'Walt Disney Pictures,' and upon reading the fresh post, Director An Gabok's mouth fell open slightly. \\"Huh?\\" Subsequently, the foreign key staff of 'Clown' also gathered around Director An Gabok. \\"???\\" They all looked at something and raised question marks in their eyes. Meanwhile, in Korea. Unlike the afternoon in LA, it was morning in Korea. Nevertheless, a massive crowd had gathered at a large department store in Seoul. The store was usually crowded, but now, the number of people was so large it was almost shocking. Easily surpassing hundreds. The location was the lobby on the first floor of the department store. A section for events was set up on one side of the spacious lobby. From there, people lined up in four rows, filling the lobby, and the long line extended past the entrance. Of course, the line stretched outside the department store as well. Therefore. \\"#%*&%(*#&%*(%!\\" \\"&*%(#%&#**!*!\\" \\"&())#%%!#()*(%!_\\" Incomprehensible shouts and screams filled the department store. Curious about this scene, numerous people from the second floor and above clung to the railings, filming the scene below with their phones. \\"Wow, what's this? The camera can't even capture him!\\" \\"Seriously! He's got a great physique too!\\" \\"Ah- I should have lined up earlier!\\" Amidst the hundreds of people filling the department store, a poker-faced actor in a stylish gray double coat sat down. The name of that actor was being screamed by hundreds of people around him. \\"Oppa!! Woo-jin oppa!!\\" \\"Kyaa! Kang Woo-jin!! Look this way, please!!\\" \\"Just a hand, oppa!!\\" It was Kang Woo-jin. Today, a fan signing event for the calm and collected Woo-jin was being held at this department store. Consequently, numerous fans who heard the news were rushing in even in the morning. Among them were fans from Kang Woo-jin's official domestic fan club 'Kang's Heart,' fans from Japan's fan club 'KWJ Aishiteru,' and just fans who liked Woo-jin, all mixed together. Of course, including just regular visitors to the department store. Amidst the hundreds of fans, Woo-jin. \\"Oppa! I'll support you in 'Clown'! Make sure you get the role!\\" \\"Thank you, I'll do my best. What's your name?\\" \\"It's Ara! Jo Ara!\\" \\"Thank you for coming.\\" \\"No way! I had to come!\\" He was busy signing autographs, greeting each fan one by one. His act was intense, but his tone was a bit softer than usual when dealing with fans. Then, after finishing a signature, Woo-jin glanced at the hundreds of fans waiting. \\"Phew- Can I finish this in half a day? I think I might need more time.\\" Even as he signed frantically, there was no sign of the line of fans shortening. His fingers were starting to hurt. But he couldn't show any weakness. Just like during filming, Kang Woo-jin's act became even more intense when fans crowded around him. Soon, Woo-jin, gathering his spirits, was about to gesture to the next fan when. \\"......?\\" \\"Right?... Wow.\\" \\"Really? No way...\\" \\"Wow...\\" The hundreds of fans suddenly began to murmur. It was a stark contrast to the moment before when they were shouting for Woo-jin. Inside, Woo-jin wondered. \\"What's going on? Suddenly.\\" An air of great curiosity was building up. At this point, the hundreds of fans gathered in the department store were all staring intently at Kang Woo-jin. Their eyes were filled with shock. At that moment, Woo-jin sensed something was not right. Then. \\"...Oppa?\\" A familiar female voice came from the right. Woo-jin turned to see the representative of the official fan club 'Kang's Heart,' 'Blood Woman.' No, it was his sister, Kang Hyun-ah. She tapped her phone with her index finger, her face drained of color, and asked Kang Woo-jin. \\"Oppa, the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'... Are you a candidate actor?\\""},{"prompt":"391화 압도 (20) 강우진이 LA에 도착함과 동시에 뜬 ‘이로운 악’의 1차 공식 티저. -【2월 3일 전세계 공개!】‘이로운 악’ 공식 1차 티저 예고편 ｜넷플렉스 코리아 덤덤한 얼굴로 한예정의 핸드폰 화면을 보는 우진이었지만 속내로는 약간 놀랐다. ‘오? 대박.’ 넷플렉스 코리아 공식 너튜브 채널에 업로드된 1차 티저는 단 10분 만에. ‘조회수 11만??’ 본 사람이 11만이 넘어가고 있었으니까. 분명, 심상치 않은 괴력이었다. 우진은 일단 마음을 가라앉혔다. 그리곤 천천히 고개 끄덕이며 한예정에게 말했다. “응, 내 거로 볼게.” 파란 단발 한예정이 핸드폰을 회수했다. 곧, 승합차 안 인원들 전부가 ‘이로운 악’의 1차 티저를 켰다. 우진도 같았다. -스윽. 바로 티저를 재생시키는 강우진. 30초 남짓의 러닝타임. 시작은 블랙화면에 웅장한 음악이 깔리는 것부터였다. 그리고 서서히 군복 입은 강우진의 모습이 나왔고 그의 목소리가 깔렸다. 마일리 카라의 대사가 곧바로 이어졌다. 티저는 대체로 한 컷에 오랜 시간을 할애하지 않았다. ‘티저가 겁내 긴박하네.’ 빠르게 여러 장면이 교차하지만 ‘이로운 악’의 주제를 명확하게 설명하고 있었다. 주요 인물들의 얼굴들, 총격씬, 폭발씬, 액션씬 등등. 마치 티저가 시청자를 공격하는 듯한 느낌이 물씬 들었고, ‘이로운 악’의 남주 강우진이 단독 메인이 된 느낌. 그의 영어 대사도 티저를 꾸몄다. 한창 LA의 도심에 들어설 때쯤 주변 팀원들이 하나둘 감탄을 뱉었다. “와- 그림 뽑힌 거 봐! 죽인다!” “오빠 나오자마자 마일리 카라 목소리 깔리는 거 소름!” “퀄 미쳤는데요?! 오빠는 어떠세요?” “어, 좋네.” “에에? 진짜 좋으신 거 맞죠??” 당연하겠지만 평이 상당했다. 조수석의 꽁지머리 최성건도 만족스레 고개를 끄덕였다. 티저의 끝에는 회색의 거친 글씨체인 글씨체와 정보가 떴다. -‘이로운 악’ -2월 3일 전세계 공개 그렇게 ‘이로운 악’의 티저가 끝났다. 무심한 얼굴로 보곤 있었지만 우진은 내면으로 엄지를 추켜세웠다. ‘응, 지리네.’ 팀원들과 같은 마음이었다. 심지어 우진은 ‘이로운 악’의 1화를 이미 봤으니 더 그랬다. ‘근데 10분 만에 11만 뷰가 나왔으면- 미친, 이거 수백만 조회수는 껌 아니냐?’ 속으로 놀라는 그. 뭐 이건 보기엔 대단해 보였으나 퍽 자연스러운 현상이었다. 현재 한국은 물론, 일본 포함 세계적으로 인지도가 떡상한 강우진이었다. 여러 나라 대중들은 호기심에 우진을 검색해볼 것이고, 너튜브에서는 방금 뜬 ‘이로운 악’ 공식 1차 티저를 제공했겠지. 현재도 많은 세계 대중들이 이 영상을 보고 있는 것이다. 실제로. ‘댓글 미친.’ 티저 댓글은 이미 포화라 봐도 무방했다. 한국어는 당연했고, 일본어, 영어, 불어 등등등. 수많은 언어가 넘실거리고 있었다. 몇몇 영어 댓글들이 우진의 눈에 띄었다. -이 한국배우가 이번 야수 역 후보 배우로 확정된 강우진이 맞아? -야수 역에 당신은 안 어울려 -오 강우진을 검색했는데 그의 신작 작품이 뜨네? 한국작품인가? 넷플렉스에 공개되면 보고 평가해봐야겠어 -검색해보니까 강우진이란 한국배우, 작년 칸에서 남우주연상을 탔던데? 연기를 잘하나 봐. 궁금하네. -마일리 카라? 왜 마일리 카라가 한국작품에 등장하지? -강우진이 마일리 카라의 저번 앨범에 같이 한 건 좋았지만, 야수와 미녀는 디즈니가 잘못 판단했어 -왜들 섣부르게 판단하는 거야 아직 그가 확정된 것도 아닌데 긍정, 부정, 중립. 수천 댓글들엔 통일감이 없었다. 모두 제각각 할 말을 뱉어대고 있었다. 한국어와 일본어는 대체로 기대감과 극찬이었다. ‘이로운 악’을 기다리고 있었다는 마일리 카라 팬들도 꽤 보였지만, 역시 단연 강우진과 ‘야수와 미녀’를 붙여서 말하는 사람들이 반 이상을 차지했다. 뭐랄까, 욕과 물음표가 많았고 벼른다는 분위기. 폭발적인 댓글의 상황을 체크한 팀원들이 딱딱한 얼굴의 강우진 눈치를 살폈다. 허나 그는 별수롭지 않았다. ‘발작하네, 발작해. 아직 오디션 시작도 안 했구만.’ 애초에 이런 사태에 타격이 전혀 없는 우진이었으니까. ‘뭐 내가 먹긴 할거긴 해.’ 이후. LA에 도착한 강우진은 적응에 돌입했다. 그러면서도 ‘삐에로’ 오디션·스크린 테스트를 준비했다. 시간이 훅훅 넘어간다. 헐리웃은 시끌시끌했다. 한국과 다르지 않게 여러 이슈들이 펑펑 터지고 있었으니까. 오디션이 목전인 ‘삐에로’, 배우 발표 뒤로 조용한 ‘야수와 미녀’, 화제 된 강우진과 마일리 카라의 ‘이로운 악’, 기타 등등의 뉴스들. 와중 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 쪽은 ‘야수와 미녀’ 제작 중에도 전세계 대중들의 분위기를 살폈다. “흠- 여전히 강우진으로 시끄럽네요.” “예상했던 바였잖아요.” “그렇긴 하지만 너무 시끄러우니까.” “놀라운 결정이긴 하죠, 하지만 저희는 밀어붙이는 수밖엔 없어요.” “음.” “아직 배우가 확정된 것도 아니고, 행여 강우진으로 결정된다고 해도- 결국 완성품과 실력으로 답하는 게 맞습니다.” 글로벌하게 난리법석이었지만, ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’는 이런 일이 한두 번이 아니기에 의연하게 대처하고 있었다. 반대로 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’는 약간 당황했다. ‘야수와 미녀’ 소식은 그들도 몰랐으니까. 약간 ‘삐에로’에 강우진이 포함된 걸 보고 깜짝 놀랐던 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와 비슷했다. 다만, 오디션이 코앞인 데다 ‘삐에로’는 거대한 프로젝트의 시발점. ‘시네마틱 유니버스’ 말이다. 워낙 사활을 건 느낌이기에 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 높으신 분들 사이론 의견이 약간 분분했다. “강우진이 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와 얘기가 되고 있다는 걸 아무도 몰랐나?” “알았다고 한들 달라지는 건 없어. 이미 발표했고. 오디션도 며칠 뒤니까.” “충분히 번복하는 것도 가능하잖아, ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와 같은 배우를 업고 가는 건 우리 역사에 없었다고.” “세상에 던져지는 시기가 다르다면 큰 문제는 없을 거야. 이제와서 번복하는 거야말로 자존심이 상하는 문제지.” 사이에는 강우진의 체력 문제도 대두됐다. “만약, 두 작품이 동시에 들어간다면 두 쪽 모두 피해가 갈지도 몰라.” 하지만 이건 안가복 감독이 원천 봉쇄했다. “그런 일은 없을 겁니다.” “음?” “강우진은 ‘거머리’를 찍을 때 몇 작품을 동시에 진행했으니까요. 그 지옥 같은 스케줄을 전부 소화하면서. 제가 보증하죠.” 결과적으로는. “일단, 오디션은 보는 거로 합의하지.” 오디션 강행이 우세했다. 며칠 뒤 25일, LA. 아침 10시쯤. 놀이동산 또는 한 도시를 방불케 하는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 내부 중, 여러 테스트를 진행하는 한 중형 홀. 스크린이 달린 적당한 무대, 백여 석이 넘는 좌석들, 천장의 조명 등등. 홀은 약간 소극장 느낌. 그런 홀에 외국인들이 붐볐다. “테이블! 테이블 이쪽으로!” “카메라 세팅 아직입니까??!” “테이블 작아요! 더 큰 거로!” “이쪽!! 이쪽 바닥 이상한 소리 나는데 문제 있는 거 아닙니까?!” 최소 20명 넘는 외국인들이 시끄러운 영어를 뱉으면서 바삐 움직이는 중이었다. 무대 위를 청소하거나 점검하고, 한쪽에 기나긴 테이블과 모니터가 놓이고, 무대 곳곳에 종류별 카메라가 세팅되는 등 수십 외국인들은 정신없이 움직였다. 당연히 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 쪽 인원들. 더 정확히 하자면 ‘삐에로’의 스탭들이었다. 전부가 무척이나 예민하며 열정적이다. 당연했다. “정신 차려요! 오늘이 우리 ‘삐에로’ 오디션, 스크린 테스트인 걸 잊지 말라고!” 이곳에서 ‘삐에로’의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 시작되니까. 금일은 주연 중, 남자 배우들만 진행할 예정이었다. 그렇게 30분쯤 흘렀을까? 얼추 무대 세팅이 마무리될 때쯤, 홀로 스탭들이 아닌 다른 외국인들이 속속 입장하기 시작했다. 일단, 단발보다 조금 긴 머리에 인상이 세다 싶은 여자부터. ‘삐에로’의 총괄 프로듀서였다. 그녀가 오디션이 진행될 홀을 둘러보며 고개를 끄덕였다. “괜찮군, 고생들 많았어요.” 이정도 세팅이면 충분하다는 뜻. 그녀를 이어 ‘삐에로’의 캐디 포함 키스탭들이 입장했고, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들도 하나둘 모습을 드러냈다. 다만, 이번엔 수가 많았다. 처음 보는 간부도 포함이었다. 대략 8명은 돼 보였다. 그다음 나타난 것이. -스윽. 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독. ‘삐에로’와 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 시발탄을 쏠 한국감독. 안가복 감독은 꽤 넓은 홀을 바라보며 작게 숨을 뱉었다. “후- 이제 시작이구만.” 잠시잠깐 그의 뇌리에 곧 만날 강우진이 스쳤다. 이후. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 관계자들이 모두 도착한 뒤로는 헐리웃 배우들 차례였다. ‘삐에로’ 남주 후보 배우로 확정된 헐리웃 슈퍼스타들. “안녕하세요-” 얼굴만 봐도 알법한 헐리웃 배우 입장. 첫 번째 배우는 스탭 4명과 함께였다. 스탭들과도 친분이 있는지 적당히 인사한 뒤 한쪽 좌석을 차지했다. 후로 속속 헐리웃 배우들이 도착. 모두들 얼추 인사를 나눈 뒤 백여 개 좌석 중 공백을 채웠다. 대부분 배우들은 팀원들과 함께였다. 어느새 홀에 모인 인원이 50명을 넘기고 있었다. 이유야 간단했다. 오늘 하는 오디션, 스크린 테스트는 공개로 진행되니까. 즉, 배우들의 모습을 여기 있는 모두가 본다는 얘기. 이때였다. -스윽. 홀로 네 번째 후보 배우가 방금 나타났다. 흑발에 한국배우. 그가 등장하자마자 홀의 ‘삐에로’ 제작진, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들까지 싹- 다 시선을 고정했다. 헐리웃 배우들은 고개를 돌린 채 속으로 한마디씩 읊조렸다. ‘저 남자가 그-’ ‘흠, 사진으로 본 것보다 키가 큰가? 분위기가 특이하군.’ ‘유일한 한국배우. 궁금증이 오늘 풀리겠지.’ 강우진이었다. 시선을 한 몸에 받은 우진은 여러 팀원들을 대동하지 않았다. 딱 한 명 최성건뿐이었다. 그런 우진의 얼굴은 근엄함이 가득했다. 그러나 내면으론 약간 호들갑을 떨고 있었다. ‘오우! 뭐냐? 사이즈 겁내 큰데?? 와- 저기 배우들 전부 어디서 본 듯! 개신기!’ 그러다 우진은 눈치챘다. ‘아- 역시.’ 자신이 입은 의상과 저기 앞에 앉은 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 비슷하다는 것을. 지금 강우진은 빨간 재킷과 바지, 노란 조끼, 헤진 갈색 구두 차림이었다. 전체적으로 헌 옷처럼 헤졌다. ‘삐에로’의 ‘헨리 고든’과 같은 복장을 입고 온 것. 그리고 경쟁자인 헐리웃 배우들도 생각은 같았다. ‘약간씩 다르긴 해도 다들 비슷하게 입고 왔네.’ 한 배우는 ‘헨리 고든’의 후반부 모습처럼 장발을 뒤로 넘긴 듯한 헤어까지 세팅했다. 그런 어마무시한 헐리웃 스타들 덕분에 강우진의 심장박동이 빨라졌다. 하지만 괜찮다. 버릇적 컨셉질과 ‘야수화’가 있으니까. 잠시간 분위기를 훑던 우진에게 최성건이 귓속말했다. “가자.” 우진이 고개를 끄덕일 때 돌연 뒤에서 남자 목소리의 영어가 끼었다. “잘 지냈나요?” 돌아보니 갈색 눈동자에 눈매가 고혹적인 잘생긴 남자가 서 있었다. 헐리웃 탑배우 겸, 과거 강우진과 사건이 있었던 크리스 하트넷이었다. 미소를 띤 그가 강우진에게 손을 내밀었다. “강우진씨, 오늘은 내 이름을 기억할 거죠?” 묵묵한 표정으로 크리스의 손을 잡는 우진. “안녕하세요, 크리스.” “당신의 연기 기대하고 있어요.” “저도 마찬가지입니다.” “하하하, 역시 재밌어. 들어가죠.” 손을 놓은 크리스 하트넷이 먼저 홀로 들어갔다. 강우진도 발을 움직였다. 곧, ‘삐에로’의 5명 후보 배우들이 모두 좌석에 앉았다. 홀의 전체 구도는 이랬다. 무대 위 모니터 올려진 테이블엔 총괄 프로듀서, 안가복 감독, 캐디 등이 앉았다. 무대 바로 앞 첫 줄 좌석에는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들이, 오른쪽 끝쪽엔 ‘삐에로’의 십수 명 키스탭들이 자리했다. 그 뒤쪽에 강우진과 최성건. 나머지 헐리웃 배우들과 팀원들은 전체 좌석 중 듬성듬성 앉은 느낌. 공개 오디션·스크린 테스트가 시작될 중형 홀의 공기는 조금 무거웠다. 진중하며 고요하기도 했다. 이쯤 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 8명 간부 전부가 무대 위 총괄 프로듀서에 눈짓했다. 시작해도 된다는 뜻. 이에 고개 끄덕인 인상 센 여자 프로듀서가 입을 열었다. 당연히 영어였다. “시작할까요?” 무대에 설치된 카메라들마다 스탭들이 붙었고 심사위원석 위의 모니터가 켜졌다. 조절되는 조명. 안가복 감독 포함 심사위원은 지급된 투명 파일을 펼쳤다. 배우들의 프로필이었다. 여자 프로듀서가 후보 배우들 모인 좌석을 보며 다시 말했다. “사전에 공유한 건 지정, 자유 연기를 같이 본다고 했는데 좀 변화를 줬어요. 배우님들은 자유 연기만 보여주시면 됩니다. 대신, 근간은 ‘헨리 고든’이어야 합니다.” 헐리웃 배우들이 약간 수군댔다. 그러거나 말거나 프로듀서는 별수롭지 않게 말을 이었다. “즉, ‘헨리 고든’으로서 어떤 연기든 자유롭게 보여주세요.”","completion":"Episode 391: Overwhelming (20) As Kang Woo-jin arrived in LA, the first official teaser for 'The Beneficial Evil' was released. -【Worldwide Release on February 3rd!】'The Beneficial Evil' Official First Teaser Trailer | Netflix Korea Woo-jin watched the teaser on Han Ye-jung's phone with a calm face, but inside, he was slightly surprised. \\"Oh? That's amazing.\\" The first teaser uploaded to the official Netflix Korea YouTube channel had reached. \\"110,000 views in just 10 minutes??\\" With over 110,000 people having watched it, it was undoubtedly an extraordinary feat. Woo-jin composed himself and then slowly nodded to Han Ye-jung. \\"Yeah, I'll watch it on my device.\\" Han Ye-jung with her short blue hair took back her phone. Soon, everyone in the van started watching the first teaser of 'The Beneficial Evil.' Woo-jin did the same. -Swish. Woo-jin immediately played the teaser. With a runtime of just over 30 seconds, it began with a black screen and majestic music. Slowly, the image of Kang Woo-jin in military uniform appeared, and his voice was heard. Miley Cara's lines followed right after. The teaser generally did not linger on any single shot for long. \\"The teaser is quite intense.\\" Despite the rapid cross-cutting of various scenes, the teaser clearly conveyed the theme of 'The Beneficial Evil.' Faces of key characters, gunfight scenes, explosions, action scenes, and more. It felt as if the teaser was attacking the viewers, with 'The Beneficial Evil's' male lead Kang Woo-jin as the main focus. His English lines also adorned the teaser. As they were entering downtown LA, the team members around him began to express their admiration one by one. \\"Wow, look at those visuals! Killer!\\" \\"The moment oppa appears and Miley Cara's voice comes in, I got chills!\\" \\"The quality is insane, right?! What do you think, oppa?\\" \\"Yeah, it's good.\\" \\"Really? You really like it??\\" Naturally, the feedback was substantial. The ponytailed Choi Sung-gun in the passenger seat also nodded in satisfaction. At the end of the teaser, the title and information appeared in a rough gray font. -'The Beneficial Evil' -Worldwide release on February 3rd That's how the teaser for 'The Beneficial Evil' ended. Although he watched with an indifferent face, Woo-jin internally gave a thumbs up. \\"Yeah, that's killer.\\" He shared the sentiment with his team members. Moreover, Woo-jin had already seen the first episode of 'The Beneficial Evil,' so he felt even more impressed. \\"But if it got 110,000 views in just 10 minutes - insane, this could easily hit millions of views, right?\\" He was internally astonished. Although it seemed impressive, it was a natural phenomenon. Kang Woo-jin's recognition had skyrocketed not only in Korea but also in Japan and globally. People around the world would search for Woo-jin out of curiosity, and YouTube would have just provided the freshly released official first teaser of 'The Beneficial Evil.' Many people worldwide were currently watching this video. In fact. \\"The comments are insane.\\" The comments on the teaser were already saturated. Korean was a given, but there were also Japanese, English, French, and many other languages. A few English comments caught Woo-jin's eye. -Is this Korean actor the same Kang Woo-jin who was confirmed as a candidate for the role of the Beast? -You don't suit the role of the Beast. -Oh, I searched for Kang Woo-jin and his new work popped up? Is it a Korean production? I'll have to watch it on Netflix and judge. -I looked up this Korean actor Kang Woo-jin, he won Best Actor at Cannes last year? He must be a good actor. I'm curious. -Miley Cara? Why is Miley Cara appearing in a Korean production? -I liked Kang Woo-jin's collaboration on Miley Cara's last album, but Disney made a mistake with Beauty and the Beast. -Why are you all making hasty judgments when he hasn't been confirmed yet? Positive, negative, neutral. The thousands of comments lacked uniformity. Everyone was spouting their own opinions. Korean and Japanese comments were generally filled with anticipation and praise. There were quite a few Miley Cara fans who were looking forward to 'The Beneficial Evil,' but more than half were talking about Kang Woo-jin and 'Beauty and the Beast.' It was an atmosphere filled with criticism and question marks. After checking the explosive comment situation, the team members glanced at the stoic-faced Kang Woo-jin. However, he was unfazed. \\"They're freaking out, freaking out. The audition hasn't even started yet.\\" Woo-jin was unaffected by such situations. \\"Well, I'm going to get it anyway.\\" Afterward. Having arrived in LA, Kang Woo-jin began to adapt. At the same time, he prepared for the 'Clown' audition and screen test. Time flew by. Hollywood was bustling. Like Korea, various issues were exploding. 'Clown' with its upcoming audition, 'Beauty and the Beast' quiet after the actor announcement, the buzzed-about 'The Beneficial Evil' with Kang Woo-jin and Miley Cara, and other news. Meanwhile, 'Walt Disney Pictures' kept an eye on the global public mood even during the production of 'Beauty and the Beast.' \\"Hmm - it's still noisy about Kang Woo-jin.\\" \\"It's what we expected.\\" \\"Still, it's too noisy.\\" \\"It's a surprising decision, but we have no choice but to push through.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" \\"Even if Kang Woo-jin is confirmed, in the end, we should respond with the finished product and his skills.\\" Despite the global uproar, 'Walt Disney Pictures' was handling the situation calmly, as this wasn't their first rodeo. Conversely, 'Columbia Studio' was a bit flustered. They were unaware of the 'Beauty and the Beast' news. It was similar to the surprise 'Walt Disney Pictures' had when they saw Kang Woo-jin included in 'Clown.' However, with the audition just around the corner and 'Clown' being the starting point of a massive project, the 'Cinematic Universe,' there was a sense of staking everything on it, so opinions among the higher-ups at 'Columbia Studio' were somewhat divided. \\"Did no one know that Kang Woo-jin was in talks with 'Walt Disney Pictures'?\\" \\"Even if we knew, it wouldn't change anything. We've already announced it. The audition is in a few days.\\" \\"We could still reverse the decision, we've never had the same actor as 'Walt Disney Pictures' in our history.\\" \\"If the timing of the announcements was different, there wouldn't be a big problem. Reversing the decision now would be a blow to our pride.\\" Kang Woo-jin's physical condition was also brought up. \\"If both projects go on at the same time, both sides might suffer.\\" But Director An Gabok nipped that in the bud. \\"That won't happen.\\" \\"Hmm?\\" \\"Kang Woo-jin was filming 'Leech' while working on several other projects simultaneously. He managed all that hellish schedule. I guarantee it.\\" As a result. \\"Let's agree to proceed with the audition.\\" The decision to go ahead with the audition prevailed. A few days later, on the 25th, LA. Around 10 a.m. Inside 'Columbia Studio,' which resembled an amusement park or a city, a medium-sized hall was conducting various tests. There was a modest stage with a screen, over a hundred seats, ceiling lights, and more. The hall had a bit of a small theater vibe. The hall was bustling with foreigners. \\"Table! Bring the table over here!\\" \\"Is the camera setting not done yet??!\\" \\"The table is too small! Get a bigger one!\\" \\"Over here!! There's a strange noise on the floor, is there a problem?!\\" Over twenty foreigners were moving busily, speaking loud English. They were cleaning or checking the stage, setting up long tables and monitors on one side, and various types of cameras were being set up around the stage. Dozens of foreigners were moving frantically. They were all personnel from 'Columbia Studio.' More precisely, they were staff from 'Clown.' Everyone was extremely sensitive and passionate. It was understandable. \\"Focus! Don't forget that today is our 'Clown' audition and screen test!\\" The audition and screen test for 'Clown' were about to begin here. Today, only the male lead actors were scheduled to proceed. About 30 minutes later? As the stage setting was nearly complete, other foreigners who were not staff began to enter. First, a woman with slightly longer hair than a bob cut and a stern look. She was the overall producer of 'Clown.' She looked around the hall where the audition would take place and nodded. \\"Good job, everyone worked hard.\\" The setting was sufficient. Following her, key staff from 'Clown,' including the casting director, entered, and executives from 'Columbia Studio' also began to appear one by one. However, there were many of them this time, including some new faces. There seemed to be about eight of them. Then appeared. -Swish. Director An Gabok with his wrinkled face. The Korean director who would fire the starting shot for 'Clown' and the 'Cinematic Universe.' Director An Gabok exhaled softly as he looked at the rather spacious hall. \\"Hoo- It's starting now.\\" For a brief moment, Kang Woo-jin, whom he would soon meet, crossed his mind. Afterward. After all the 'Columbia Studio' officials arrived, it was time for the Hollywood actors. The Hollywood superstars confirmed as candidates for the male lead in 'Clown.' \\"Hello-\\" A well-known Hollywood actor entered. The first actor arrived with four staff members. After greeting the staff with whom he seemed to have a good rapport, he took a seat on one side. Then, more Hollywood actors arrived one after another. After exchanging greetings, they filled the empty seats among the hundred or so. Most actors came with their teams. Soon, the number of people gathered in the hall exceeded fifty. The reason was simple. Today's audition and screen test were open to the public. In other words, everyone present would see the actors' performances. It was then. -Swish. The fourth candidate actor, a black-haired Korean actor, had just appeared. As soon as he entered, the 'Clown' production team and 'Columbia Studio' executives all fixed their gaze on him. The Hollywood actors turned their heads and murmured to themselves. \\"That man is the one-\\" \\"Hmm, is he taller than he looks in photos? He has a unique aura.\\" \\"The only Korean actor. Today will clear up the curiosity.\\" It was Kang Woo-jin. Woo-jin, who received all the attention, did not bring a large team with him. Only Choi Sung-gun accompanied him. Woo-jin's face was filled with solemnity, but inside, he was a bit flustered. \\"Wow! What's this? The size is huge?? Wow- I recognize all those actors from somewhere! So fascinating!\\" Then Woo-jin realized. \\"Ah- of course.\\" He noticed that his outfit was similar to that of the Hollywood actors sitting in front of him. Kang Woo-jin was dressed in a red jacket and pants, a yellow vest, and worn brown shoes. The overall look was like worn-out clothes. He had come dressed as 'Henry Gordon' from 'Clown,' and his competitors, the Hollywood actors, had the same idea. \\"They all dressed similarly, though slightly different.\\" One actor even styled his hair long and swept back, resembling 'Henry Gordon' in the latter part of the film. Thanks to the presence of these formidable Hollywood stars, Kang Woo-jin's heartbeat quickened. But it was okay. He had his habitual act and 'Beastification.' After scanning the atmosphere for a moment, Choi Sung-gun whispered to Woo-jin. \\"Let's go.\\" As Woo-jin nodded, suddenly a man's voice in English came from behind. \\"Have you been well?\\" Turning around, Woo-jin saw a handsome man with brown eyes and an alluring gaze. It was Chris Hartnett, a Hollywood top actor and someone who had a past incident with Kang Woo-jin. Smiling, he extended his hand to Kang Woo-jin. \\"Kang Woo-jin, you'll remember my name today, right?\\" Woo-jin shook Chris's hand with a silent expression. \\"Hello, Chris.\\" \\"I'm looking forward to your performance.\\" \\"I feel the same.\\" \\"Hahaha, as expected, this is fun. Let's go in.\\" Chris Hartnett entered the hall first, and Kang Woo-jin followed suit. Soon, all five candidate actors for 'Clown' were seated. The overall layout of the hall was as follows: On the stage, the overall producer, Director An Gabok, and the casting director sat at a table with monitors. In the front row seats right in front of the stage were the 'Columbia Studio' executives, and on the far right were a dozen key staff from 'Clown.' Behind them were Kang Woo-jin and Choi Sung-gun. The rest of the Hollywood actors and their teams were sparsely seated among the overall seats. The atmosphere in the medium-sized hall, where the open audition and screen test were about to start, was somewhat heavy. It was serious and quiet. At this point, all eight executives from 'Columbia Studio' gestured to the overall producer on the stage. It meant they were ready to start. The stern-looking female producer then spoke up. Naturally, it was in English. \\"Shall we begin?\\" Staff members approached the cameras set up on the stage, and monitors above the judges' seats turned on. The lights were adjusted. The judges, including Director An Gabok, unfolded the transparent files provided to them. They were the actors' profiles. The female producer looked at the seats where the candidate actors were gathered and spoke again. \\"We shared in advance that we would look at both designated and free acting, but we've made some changes. Actors, you only need to show us your free acting. However, it must be based on 'Henry Gordon.'\\" The Hollywood actors murmured slightly. Regardless, the producer continued without much concern. \\"In other words, please freely show us any performance as 'Henry Gordon.'\\""},{"prompt":"I'm working on a cinematic intro for my dark fantasy game, similar to Dark Souls 3.

Voy a organizar este iceberg en niveles, de más accesibles y comunes en la cima, hasta los más específicos y potencialmente lucrativos en la base, tomando en cuenta tanto la facilidad para tener éxito como el potencial de crecimiento y generación de ingresos. **Nivel de la Superficie (Más accesibles y comunes)** - Vlogs y vida cotidiana: Mucha gente inicia canales personales compartiendo su día a día, pero la saturación hace que sea difícil destacar sin una personalidad o estilo de vida únicos. - Gaming: Uno de los nichos más populares. Los canales de videojuegos pueden crecer rápidamente si cubren juegos populares, pero la competencia es intensa. - Tutorials y \\"Cómo se hace\\": Si bien son muy buscados y pueden ser monetizados fácilmente, la competencia es feroz y es difícil destacar. **Nivel del Medio (Éxito y crecimiento moderado)** - Fitness y salud: Los canales que ofrecen rutinas de ejercicios y consejos de salud tienden a tener un buen crecimiento y un público comprometido. - Educación y aprendizaje: Canales que ofrecen contenido educativo sobre temas específicos como historia, ciencia o programación pueden generar ingresos estables a través de patrocinios y ventas de cursos. - Reviews de tecnología: Las reseñas de gadgets, teléfonos y software atraen a un público que puede convertirse en ventas afiliadas, aunque requieren inversión inicial. **Nivel Profundo (Especializados y con buen crecimiento)** - Finanzas personales e inversión: Un nicho altamente lucrativo debido a su audiencia objetivo y oportunidades para monetización directa y afiliados. - Beauty y moda: Influencia considerable en las tendencias de compra, lo que abre puertas a colaboraciones de marca y patrocinios. - Cocina y gastronomía: Canales que ofrecen recetas y técnicas de cocina pueden obtener ingresos a través de patrocinios y la venta de productos de cocina afiliados. **Nivel Abismal (Éxito y crecimiento específicos, potencialmente muy lucrativo)** - Nichos B2B (Business-to-Business): Canales enfocados en industrias específicas con audiencias especializadas pueden ser extremadamente lucrativos a través de patrocinios y servicios premium. - Desarrollo personal y coaching: La venta de cursos y coaching ofrece potencialmente altos ingresos. - Viajes y aventura con enfoque exclusivo: Canales que descubren destinos únicos o experiencias de viaje de lujo atraen a patrocinadores de alto nivel. **Aspectos Importantes para Considerar:** - Audiencia Objetivo: Nichos con una audiencia definida y dispuesta a gastar dinero suelen ser más lucrativos. - CPM (Costo por mil impresiones): Algunos nichos tienen un CPM más alto debido al valor del público para los anunciantes. Nichos como finanzas, tecnología y negocios suelen tener un CPM más alto. - Potencial de Conexión: Nichos que ofrezcan oportunidades de conectar profundamente con una audiencia pueden construir comunidades leales y por ende, ser más rentables. Es importante señalar que la facilidad de éxito y el potencial de crecimiento pueden variar significativamente con el tiempo debido a cambios en las tendencias, las políticas de monetización de YouTube y la aparición de nuevos competidores. Además, el éxito en YouTube requiere consistencia, calidad de contenido, habilidades de SEO, marketing, entre otros factores."},{"prompt":"Datos y curiosidades (canal divulgativo de ciencia e historia) en que categoría de nicho entra?","completion":"Un canal de YouTube dedicado a datos y curiosidades con un enfoque en ciencia e historia generalmente se clasificaría dentro del nicho educativo o de divulgación. Dependiendo de cómo se presenten los contenidos, este tipo de canal puede estar posicionado en varios niveles en el \\"iceberg de nichos\\". No obstante, aquí te muestro dónde podría encajar típicamente: **Nivel de la Superficie (Más accesibles y comunes):** - Si el canal se enfoca en curiosidades y datos generales de amplio interés, puede ser accesible a una gran audiencia pero puede tener mucha competencia, lo que requiere un esfuerzo significativo para destacar. **Nivel del Medio (Éxito y crecimiento moderado):** - Un canal que ofrece contenido profundizado e informativo sobre temas específicos de ciencia e historia puede atraer a una audiencia más nicho y comprometida, lo que podría llevar a un crecimiento moderado y una comunidad leal. **Nivel Profundo (Especializados y con buen crecimiento):** - Si el canal se especializa en aspectos particulares de la ciencia o la historia, o presenta el contenido de una manera muy única o con producciones de alta calidad, podría posicionarse como una autoridad en esos temas, atraer a un público específico y tener un buen potencial de ingresos por medio de colaboraciones y patrocinios especializados. **Aspectos a Considerar en este Nicho de Divulgación:** - Calidad del contenido: Los videos bien investigados y presentados profesionalmente serán más atractivos y podrán establecer una mejor reputación. - Participación de la audiencia: A través de la narración de historias y la presentación de datos interesantes de una manera atractiva se puede maximizar la retención y participación de la audiencia. - Adaptación a las tendencias: Mantenerse al tanto de los temas de actualidad en ciencia e historia puede ayudar a captar mayor interés. - Colaboraciones: Trabajar con expertos o personalidades reconocidas en estos campos puede aumentar la credibilidad del canal y su alcance. En cuanto a los ingresos y crecimiento, los canales educativos que logran construir una comunidad comprometida tienen un gran potencial. Sin embargo, este tipo de contenido suele requerir una inversión significativa en tiempo y recursos para la investigación y producción de alta calidad. Los ingresos provienen de fuentes estándar como los anuncios de AdSense, pero también pueden aumentar significativamente a través de patrocinios, colaboraciones, ventas de mercancía y, en algunos casos, servicios de suscripción o ventas de contenido educativo complementario como libros electrónicos y cursos."},{"prompt":"• Hogyan működik az aszinkron számláló? Mik a hátrányai az aszinkron számlálónak? (Lényegretörően válaszolj!)","completion":"Az aszinkron számláló, más néven ripple counter, olyan digitális eszköz, amely flip-flopekből áll és bináris számlálást hajt végre. Minden flip-flop a számláló egy bitjét tárolja, és a flip-flopek egy sorozatban vannak összekötve úgy, hogy minden flip-flop kimenete a következő flip-flop órajel bemenetét adja. Mivel az órajel közvetlenül csak az első flip-flopra kerül alkalmazásra, a kimeneti változások sorra haladnak végig a flip-flopek láncon, ebből ered a \\"ripple\\" elnevezés. Hátrányai az aszinkron számlálóknak: 1. **Lassúság**: Mivel a flip-flopek csak egymás után változtatják állapotukat, a \\"ripple\\" hatás miatt adódó késleltetés összeadódik. A nagy számlálók esetén ez jelentősen lassíthatja a működést. 2. **Glitch-ek**: Az aszinkron jellegből adódóan a kimenetek nem változnak meg egyszerre, ezért átmeneti (glitch) értékek jelenhetnek meg a kimeneten, ami hibás működést okozhat. 3. **Szinkronizálhatóság**: Mivel a flip-flopek nem ugyanabban az időpillanatban váltanak, az aszinkron számlálókat nehezebb szinkronizálni más digitális áramkörökkel. 4. **Skálázhatóság**: Az aszinkron működés miatt ezek a számlálók nehezebben skálázhatók nagyobb rendszerekbe, ahol nagyobb sebességű és pontosabb időzítés szükséges. Mindenekelőtt a sebességkorlátozás és az átmeneti értékek a legkritikusabb pontjai az aszinkron számlálónak, ezért sok alkalmazásban helyettük szinkron számlálókat használnak, amelyekben minden flip-flop azonos órajellel van vezérelve, így a kimeneti értékek egyszerre változnak."},{"prompt":"• Mi a különbség a szinkron és aszinkron szekvenciális hálózat között? (max 1-2 mondatban válaszolj, csak a lényeget belefoglalva)","completion":"A szinkron szekvenciális hálózatokban az összes állapotváltozás egy közös órajelszignál szinkronizálásával történik egyszerre, míg az aszinkron szekvenciális hálózatokban az állapotváltozások bemeneti jelek vagy előző állapotok változásai nyomán, külön-külön, szinkronizáció nélkül következnek be."},{"prompt":"Hogyan kódolhatjuk az állapotokat?","completion":"Az állapotok kódolására állapotgépekben és szekvenciális áramkörökben többféle módszer létezik. Íme néhány alapvető stratégia: 1. **Binary Encoding (Bináris kódolás)**: Az állapotokat egyszerű bináris számokkal reprezentáljuk, ahol az állapotszám növekedésével a bináris érték is inkrementálódik. 2. **One-Hot Encoding (Egy-Hot kódolás)**: Minden állapot reprezentálása egyedülálló bit helyet kap. N bit széles állapot kódban, minden állapotot egyetlen '1'-es bit reprezentál, a többi bit pedig '0'. Egy 4 állapotú rendszer esetén ez így nézne ki: 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000. 3. **Gray Code (Gray-kód)**: Az állapotokat Gray-kóddal reprezentáljuk, ami olyan bináris kódsorozat, ahol két egymást követő érték között csak egyetlen bit változik. Ez csökkenti az átmeneti hibákat állapotváltáskor. 4. **Johnson Coding (Johnson-kódolás)**: Egy speciális kódolás, ahol az állapotváltás annak biztosításával történik, hogy egy '1'-es vagy egy '0'-s bit kerül áthelyezésre a sémiába. 5. **Sparse Encoding (Ritka kódolás)**: Olyan kódolás, amikor az állapotok közötti átmenetet úgy választjuk meg, hogy szándékosan allokálunk extra bit helyeket, bizonyos bit kombinációkat elkerülve, ezzel javítva a hibatűrő képességet. Az állapotkódolás stratégiája jelentősen befolyásolhatja a szekvenciális hálózat teljesítményét, terjedési késleltetését, helyszükségletét, és kihasználtságát.

LA에 도착한 강우진은 적응에 돌입했다. 그러면서도 ‘삐에로’ 오디션·스크린 테스트를 준비했다. 시간이 훅훅 넘어간다. 헐리웃은 시끌시끌했다. 한국과 다르지 않게 여러 이슈들이 펑펑 터지고 있었으니까. 오디션이 목전인 ‘삐에로’, 배우 발표 뒤로 조용한 ‘야수와 미녀’, 화제 된 강우진과 마일리 카라의 ‘이로운 악’, 기타 등등의 뉴스들. 와중 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 쪽은 ‘야수와 미녀’ 제작 중에도 전세계 대중들의 분위기를 살폈다. “흠- 여전히 강우진으로 시끄럽네요.” “예상했던 바였잖아요.” “그렇긴 하지만 너무 시끄러우니까.” “놀라운 결정이긴 하죠, 하지만 저희는 밀어붙이는 수밖엔 없어요.” “음.” “아직 배우가 확정된 것도 아니고, 행여 강우진으로 결정된다고 해도- 결국 완성품과 실력으로 답하는 게 맞습니다.” 글로벌하게 난리법석이었지만, ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’는 이런 일이 한두 번이 아니기에 의연하게 대처하고 있었다. 반대로 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’는 약간 당황했다. ‘야수와 미녀’ 소식은 그들도 몰랐으니까. 약간 ‘삐에로’에 강우진이 포함된 걸 보고 깜짝 놀랐던 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와 비슷했다. 다만, 오디션이 코앞인 데다 ‘삐에로’는 거대한 프로젝트의 시발점. ‘시네마틱 유니버스’ 말이다. 워낙 사활을 건 느낌이기에 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 높으신 분들 사이론 의견이 약간 분분했다. “강우진이 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와 얘기가 되고 있다는 걸 아무도 몰랐나?” “알았다고 한들 달라지는 건 없어. 이미 발표했고. 오디션도 며칠 뒤니까.” “충분히 번복하는 것도 가능하잖아, ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’와 같은 배우를 업고 가는 건 우리 역사에 없었다고.” “세상에 던져지는 시기가 다르다면 큰 문제는 없을 거야. 이제와서 번복하는 거야말로 자존심이 상하는 문제지.” 사이에는 강우진의 체력 문제도 대두됐다. “만약, 두 작품이 동시에 들어간다면 두 쪽 모두 피해가 갈지도 몰라.” 하지만 이건 안가복 감독이 원천 봉쇄했다. “그런 일은 없을 겁니다.” “음?” “강우진은 ‘거머리’를 찍을 때 몇 작품을 동시에 진행했으니까요. 그 지옥 같은 스케줄을 전부 소화하면서. 제가 보증하죠.” 결과적으로는. “일단, 오디션은 보는 거로 합의하지.” 오디션 강행이 우세했다. 며칠 뒤 25일, LA. 아침 10시쯤. 놀이동산 또는 한 도시를 방불케 하는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 내부 중, 여러 테스트를 진행하는 한 중형 홀. 스크린이 달린 적당한 무대, 백여 석이 넘는 좌석들, 천장의 조명 등등. 홀은 약간 소극장 느낌. 그런 홀에 외국인들이 붐볐다. “테이블! 테이블 이쪽으로!” “카메라 세팅 아직입니까??!” “테이블 작아요! 더 큰 거로!” “이쪽!! 이쪽 바닥 이상한 소리 나는데 문제 있는 거 아닙니까?!” 최소 20명 넘는 외국인들이 시끄러운 영어를 뱉으면서 바삐 움직이는 중이었다. 무대 위를 청소하거나 점검하고, 한쪽에 기나긴 테이블과 모니터가 놓이고, 무대 곳곳에 종류별 카메라가 세팅되는 등 수십 외국인들은 정신없이 움직였다. 당연히 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 쪽 인원들. 더 정확히 하자면 ‘삐에로’의 스탭들이었다. 전부가 무척이나 예민하며 열정적이다. 당연했다. “정신 차려요! 오늘이 우리 ‘삐에로’ 오디션, 스크린 테스트인 걸 잊지 말라고!” 이곳에서 ‘삐에로’의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 시작되니까. 금일은 주연 중, 남자 배우들만 진행할 예정이었다. 그렇게 30분쯤 흘렀을까? 얼추 무대 세팅이 마무리될 때쯤, 홀로 스탭들이 아닌 다른 외국인들이 속속 입장하기 시작했다. 일단, 단발보다 조금 긴 머리에 인상이 세다 싶은 여자부터. ‘삐에로’의 총괄 프로듀서였다. 그녀가 오디션이 진행될 홀을 둘러보며 고개를 끄덕였다. “괜찮군, 고생들 많았어요.” 이정도 세팅이면 충분하다는 뜻. 그녀를 이어 ‘삐에로’의 캐디 포함 키스탭들이 입장했고, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들도 하나둘 모습을 드러냈다. 다만, 이번엔 수가 많았다. 처음 보는 간부도 포함이었다. 대략 8명은 돼 보였다. 그다음 나타난 것이. -스윽. 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독. ‘삐에로’와 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 시발탄을 쏠 한국감독. 안가복 감독은 꽤 넓은 홀을 바라보며 작게 숨을 뱉었다. “후- 이제 시작이구만.” 잠시잠깐 그의 뇌리에 곧 만날 강우진이 스쳤다. 이후. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 관계자들이 모두 도착한 뒤로는 헐리웃 배우들 차례였다. ‘삐에로’ 남주 후보 배우로 확정된 헐리웃 슈퍼스타들. “안녕하세요-” 얼굴만 봐도 알법한 헐리웃 배우 입장. 첫 번째 배우는 스탭 4명과 함께였다. 스탭들과도 친분이 있는지 적당히 인사한 뒤 한쪽 좌석을 차지했다. 후로 속속 헐리웃 배우들이 도착. 모두들 얼추 인사를 나눈 뒤 백여 개 좌석 중 공백을 채웠다. 대부분 배우들은 팀원들과 함께였다. 어느새 홀에 모인 인원이 50명을 넘기고 있었다. 이유야 간단했다. 오늘 하는 오디션, 스크린 테스트는 공개로 진행되니까. 즉, 배우들의 모습을 여기 있는 모두가 본다는 얘기. 이때였다. -스윽. 홀로 네 번째 후보 배우가 방금 나타났다. 흑발에 한국배우. 그가 등장하자마자 홀의 ‘삐에로’ 제작진, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들까지 싹- 다 시선을 고정했다. 헐리웃 배우들은 고개를 돌린 채 속으로 한마디씩 읊조렸다. ‘저 남자가 그-’ ‘흠, 사진으로 본 것보다 키가 큰가? 분위기가 특이하군.’ ‘유일한 한국배우. 궁금증이 오늘 풀리겠지.’ 강우진이었다. 시선을 한 몸에 받은 우진은 여러 팀원들을 대동하지 않았다. 딱 한 명 최성건뿐이었다. 그런 우진의 얼굴은 근엄함이 가득했다. 그러나 내면으론 약간 호들갑을 떨고 있었다. ‘오우! 뭐냐? 사이즈 겁내 큰데?? 와- 저기 배우들 전부 어디서 본 듯! 개신기!’ 그러다 우진은 눈치챘다. ‘아- 역시.’ 자신이 입은 의상과 저기 앞에 앉은 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 비슷하다는 것을. 지금 강우진은 빨간 재킷과 바지, 노란 조끼, 헤진 갈색 구두 차림이었다. 전체적으로 헌 옷처럼 헤졌다. ‘삐에로’의 ‘헨리 고든’과 같은 복장을 입고 온 것. 그리고 경쟁자인 헐리웃 배우들도 생각은 같았다. ‘약간씩 다르긴 해도 다들 비슷하게 입고 왔네.’ 한 배우는 ‘헨리 고든’의 후반부 모습처럼 장발을 뒤로 넘긴 듯한 헤어까지 세팅했다. 그런 어마무시한 헐리웃 스타들 덕분에 강우진의 심장박동이 빨라졌다. 하지만 괜찮다. 버릇적 컨셉질과 ‘야수화’가 있으니까. 잠시간 분위기를 훑던 우진에게 최성건이 귓속말했다. “가자.” 우진이 고개를 끄덕일 때 돌연 뒤에서 남자 목소리의 영어가 끼었다. “잘 지냈나요?” 돌아보니 갈색 눈동자에 눈매가 고혹적인 잘생긴 남자가 서 있었다. 헐리웃 탑배우 겸, 과거 강우진과 사건이 있었던 크리스 하트넷이었다. 미소를 띤 그가 강우진에게 손을 내밀었다. “강우진씨, 오늘은 내 이름을 기억할 거죠?” 묵묵한 표정으로 크리스의 손을 잡는 우진. “안녕하세요, 크리스.” “당신의 연기 기대하고 있어요.” “저도 마찬가지입니다.” “하하하, 역시 재밌어. 들어가죠.” 손을 놓은 크리스 하트넷이 먼저 홀로 들어갔다. 강우진도 발을 움직였다. 곧, ‘삐에로’의 5명 후보 배우들이 모두 좌석에 앉았다. 홀의 전체 구도는 이랬다. 무대 위 모니터 올려진 테이블엔 총괄 프로듀서, 안가복 감독, 캐디 등이 앉았다. 무대 바로 앞 첫 줄 좌석에는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들이, 오른쪽 끝쪽엔 ‘삐에로’의 십수 명 키스탭들이 자리했다. 그 뒤쪽에 강우진과 최성건. 나머지 헐리웃 배우들과 팀원들은 전체 좌석 중 듬성듬성 앉은 느낌. 공개 오디션·스크린 테스트가 시작될 중형 홀의 공기는 조금 무거웠다. 진중하며 고요하기도 했다. 이쯤 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 8명 간부 전부가 무대 위 총괄 프로듀서에 눈짓했다. 시작해도 된다는 뜻. 이에 고개 끄덕인 인상 센 여자 프로듀서가 입을 열었다. 당연히 영어였다. “시작할까요?” 무대에 설치된 카메라들마다 스탭들이 붙었고 심사위원석 위의 모니터가 켜졌다. 조절되는 조명. 안가복 감독 포함 심사위원은 지급된 투명 파일을 펼쳤다. 배우들의 프로필이었다. 여자 프로듀서가 후보 배우들 모인 좌석을 보며 다시 말했다. “사전에 공유한 건 지정, 자유 연기를 같이 본다고 했는데 좀 변화를 줬어요. 배우님들은 자유 연기만 보여주시면 됩니다. 대신, 근간은 ‘헨리 고든’이어야 합니다.” 헐리웃 배우들이 약간 수군댔다. 그러거나 말거나 프로듀서는 별수롭지 않게 말을 이었다. “즉, ‘헨리 고든’으로서 어떤 연기든 자유롭게 보여주세요.”","completion":"Episode 391: Overwhelming (20) As soon as Kang Woojin arrived in LA, the first official teaser for \\"Beneficial Evil\\" was released. -【Worldwide release on February 3rd!】'Beneficial Evil' Official First Teaser Trailer | Netflix Korea Woojin was looking at Han Yejeong's phone screen with a calm face, but inside he was slightly surprised. \\"Oh? Awesome.\\" The first teaser uploaded to the official Netflix Korea YouTube channel reached in just 10 minutes. \\"110,000 views??\\" Since there were over 110,000 viewers. It was certainly an extraordinary force. Woojin calmed himself down for now. Then he slowly nodded and said to Han Yejeong. \\"Yeah, I'll watch it on mine.\\" Han Yejeong with short blue hair took back her phone. Soon, everyone in the van turned on the first teaser for 'Beneficial Evil.' Woojin did the same. -Swish. Kang Woojin immediately played the teaser. The running time was just over 30 seconds. It started with a black screen and majestic music. Then, slowly, the figure of Kang Woojin in military uniform appeared, and his voice was heard. Miley Cara's lines followed immediately. The teaser did not linger on any single shot for too long. 'The teaser is incredibly intense.' Although it quickly alternated between various scenes, it clearly explained the theme of 'Beneficial Evil.' Faces of the main characters, shooting scenes, explosion scenes, action scenes, etc. The teaser gave the impression that it was attacking the viewer, with Kang Woojin as the main focus of 'Beneficial Evil.' His English lines also adorned the teaser. As they were entering downtown LA, the team members around him began to express their admiration one by one. \\"Wow- look at the graphics! Killer!\\" \\"Bro, as soon as you appear, Miley Cara's voice gives me chills!\\" \\"The quality is insane, right?! What do you think, bro?\\" \\"Yeah, it's good.\\" \\"Eh? Do you really like it??\\" Of course, the reviews were significant. Choi Seonggeon, with his ponytail in the passenger seat, also nodded in satisfaction. At the end of the teaser, the title and information appeared in a rough gray font. -'Beneficial Evil' -Worldwide release on February 3rd That's how the teaser for 'Beneficial Evil' ended. Woojin watched with an indifferent face, but internally, he gave a thumbs up. 'Yeah, it's epic.' The team members felt the same. Even more so for Woojin, who had already seen the first episode of 'Beneficial Evil.' 'But if it got 110,000 views in 10 minutes- crazy, this could easily hit millions of views, right?' He was surprised inside. Although it looked impressive, it was a natural phenomenon. Kang Woojin, who had skyrocketed in popularity not only in Korea but also in Japan and globally. People from various countries would search for Woojin out of curiosity, and YouTube would have provided the newly released 'Beneficial Evil' official first teaser. Even now, many people around the world were watching this video. In reality. 'The comments are insane.' The comments on the teaser were already saturated. Korean was a given, but there were also Japanese, English, French, etc. Numerous languages were swirling around. A few English comments caught Woojin's eye. -Is this Korean actor the confirmed candidate for the role of the Beast, Kang Woojin? -You don't suit the role of the Beast -Oh, I searched for Kang Woojin and his new work popped up? Is it a Korean production? I'll have to watch it on Netflix and see. -I looked him up, and Kang Woojin is a Korean actor who won Best Actor at Cannes last year? He must be good at acting. I'm curious. -Miley Cara? Why is Miley Cara appearing in a Korean production? -I liked Kang Woojin's collaboration on Miley Cara's last album, but Disney made a mistake with Beauty and the Beast -Why are you all making hasty judgments when it's not even confirmed yet? Positive, negative, neutral. The thousands of comments had no unity. Everyone was spouting their own opinions. Korean and Japanese comments were generally full of anticipation and praise. There were quite a few Miley Cara fans who were waiting for 'Beneficial Evil,' but still, more than half were talking about Kang Woojin and 'Beauty and the Beast.' It was a mix of criticism and question marks, a tense atmosphere. The team members checked the explosive comment situation and glanced at Kang Woojin's stiff face. However, he was unfazed. 'They're freaking out, freaking out. The audition hasn't even started yet.' After all, Woojin was not affected by such situations. 'Well, I'm going to nail it anyway.' Afterward. Upon arriving in LA, Kang Woojin began to adapt. At the same time, he prepared for the 'Pierrot' audition and screen test. Time flew by. Hollywood was bustling. Just like in Korea, various issues were exploding. The 'Pierrot' audition was imminent, the quiet 'Beauty and the Beast,' the trending Kang Woojin and Miley Cara's 'Beneficial Evil,' and other news. Meanwhile, 'World Disney Pictures' was also monitoring the global public sentiment during the production of 'Beauty and the Beast.' \\"Hmm- it's still noisy about Kang Woojin.\\" \\"It's what we expected.\\" \\"But it's too noisy.\\" \\"It's a surprising decision, but we have no choice but to push through.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" \\"Even if Kang Woojin is confirmed, in the end, we should respond with the finished product and skills.\\" Although it was globally chaotic, 'World Disney Pictures' was calmly handling the situation, as this was not their first rodeo. Conversely, 'Columbia Studio' was a bit flustered. They didn't know about the 'Beauty and the Beast' news. It was similar to the surprise 'World Disney Pictures' had when they found out Kang Woojin was included in 'Pierrot.' However, with the audition right around the corner and 'Pierrot' being the starting point of a massive project, the 'Cinematic Universe,' there was a sense of life-or-death among the 'Columbia Studio' executives, and opinions were somewhat divided. \\"Did no one know that Kang Woojin was in talks with 'World Disney Pictures'?\\" \\"Even if we knew, it wouldn't change anything. We've already announced it. The audition is in a few days.\\" \\"We could still retract it, we've never had the same actor as 'World Disney Pictures.'\\" \\"If the releases are at different times, there shouldn't be a big problem. Retracting now would be a blow to our pride.\\" Kang Woojin's stamina also came into question. \\"If both projects go on at the same time, both sides might suffer.\\" But director An Gabok nipped this in the bud. \\"That won't happen.\\" \\"Hmm?\\" \\"Kang Woojin was juggling several projects while filming 'Leech.' He managed that hellish schedule. I guarantee it.\\" As a result. \\"Let's agree to proceed with the audition.\\" The decision to go ahead with the audition prevailed. A few days later, on the 25th, in LA. Around 10 a.m. Inside 'Columbia Studio,' which resembled an amusement park or a city, in a medium-sized hall where various tests were being conducted. A stage with a screen, over a hundred seats, ceiling lights, etc. The hall had a bit of a small theater vibe. The hall was bustling with foreigners. \\"Table! The table over here!\\" \\"Is the camera setting not done yet??!\\" \\"The table is too small! Get a bigger one!\\" \\"Over here!! There's a strange noise on the floor, is there a problem?!\\" Over 20 foreigners were moving busily, speaking loud English. They were cleaning or checking the stage, setting up a long table and monitors on one side, and setting up various types of cameras around the stage. They were all staff from 'Columbia Studio,' specifically for 'Pierrot.' Everyone was extremely sensitive and passionate. Of course, it was a big day. \\"Focus! Don't forget that today is our 'Pierrot' audition, screen test!\\" This was where the audition and screen test for 'Pierrot' would begin. Today, only the male lead actors were scheduled. As the stage setting was about to be completed, other foreigners who were not staff began to enter. First, a woman with slightly longer hair than a bob cut and a strong impression. She was the overall producer of 'Pierrot.' She looked around the audition hall and nodded. \\"Good job, everyone worked hard.\\" This setting was sufficient. Following her, key staff of 'Pierrot,' including the casting director, entered, and executives from 'Columbia Studio' also began to appear one by one. However, there were many this time. Some executives were new faces. There seemed to be about eight of them. Then appeared. -Swish. Director An Gabok with a wrinkled face. The Korean director who would fire the starting shot for 'Pierrot' and the 'Cinematic Universe.' Director An Gabok took a small breath as he looked at the spacious hall. \\"Phew- it's starting now.\\" For a brief moment, Kang Woojin, whom he would soon meet, crossed his mind. Afterward. After all the 'Columbia Studio' officials arrived, it was the turn of the Hollywood actors. Hollywood superstars confirmed as candidates for the male lead of 'Pierrot.' \\"Hello-\\" A Hollywood actor whose face was recognizable entered. The first actor came with four staff members. After greeting the staff with whom he seemed to have a friendly relationship, he took a seat on one side. Then, more Hollywood actors arrived. After exchanging greetings, they filled the empty seats among the hundred or so. Most actors came with their team members. Before long, the number of people gathered in the hall exceeded 50. The reason was simple. Today's audition and screen test were open to the public. In other words, everyone present could see the actors' performances. At that moment. -Swish. The fourth candidate actor, a black-haired Korean actor, had just appeared. As soon as he entered, everyone from the 'Pierrot' production team to the 'Columbia Studio' executives fixed their gaze on him. The Hollywood actors turned their heads and muttered to themselves. 'That man is the-' 'Hmm, is he taller than he looks in photos? He has a unique aura.' 'The only Korean actor. I guess my curiosity will be satisfied today.' It was Kang Woojin. Woojin, who received all the attention, did not bring a large team. Only Choi Seonggeon was with him. Woojin's face was full of solemnity, but inside he was a bit flustered. 'Wow! What's this? The size is huge?? Wow- I've seen all those actors somewhere! So fascinating!' Then Woojin realized. 'Ah- of course.' He noticed that his outfit was similar to that of the Hollywood actors sitting in front of him. Kang Woojin was dressed in a red jacket and pants, a yellow vest, and worn brown shoes. He looked like he was wearing old, worn-out clothes, just like 'Henry Gordon' from 'Pierrot.' And the competing Hollywood actors had the same idea. 'They all dressed similarly, though slightly different.' One actor even set his hair to look like the long hair of 'Henry Gordon' in the latter part of the story. Thanks to these formidable Hollywood stars, Kang Woojin's heart rate accelerated. But it was okay. He had his habitual concept and 'beastification.' After scanning the atmosphere for a while, Choi Seonggeon whispered to Woojin. \\"Let's go.\\" As Woojin nodded, suddenly a man's voice in English came from behind. \\"Have you been well?\\" Turning around, there stood a handsome man with brown eyes and seductive eyes. It was Chris Hartnett, a Hollywood top actor and someone who had a past incident with Kang Woojin. Smiling, he extended his hand to Kang Woojin. \\"Kang Woojin, you'll remember my name today, right?\\" Woojin shook Chris's hand with a silent expression. \\"Hello, Chris.\\" \\"I'm looking forward to your performance.\\" \\"Likewise.\\" \\"Hahaha, as expected, it's fun. Let's go in.\\" Chris Hartnett, who let go of his hand, entered the hall first. Kang Woojin also moved his feet. Soon, all five candidate actors for 'Pierrot' were seated. The overall layout of the hall was as follows: On the stage, the overall producer, director An Gabok, and the casting director, etc., sat at the table with monitors. In the front row seats right in front of the stage were the 'Columbia Studio' executives, and on the far right were a dozen key staff of 'Pierrot.' Behind them were Kang Woojin and Choi Seonggeon. The rest of the Hollywood actors and their team members were sparsely seated. The air in the medium-sized hall, where the open audition and screen test were about to begin, was a bit heavy. It was serious and quiet. At this point, all eight executives of 'Columbia Studio' gestured to the overall producer on stage. It meant they could start. The woman producer with a strong impression nodded and opened her mouth. Naturally, it was in English. \\"Shall we start?\\" Staff attached to the cameras set up on the stage, and monitors on the judges' table turned on. The lights were adjusted. Director An Gabok and the other judges unfolded the transparent files they were given. They were the actors' profiles. The woman producer looked at the seats where the candidate actors were gathered and spoke again. \\"We shared in advance that we would see both the designated and free acting, but we've made some changes. Actors only need to show us their free acting. However, the basis must be 'Henry Gordon.'\\" The Hollywood actors murmured slightly. Regardless, the producer continued without much concern. \\"In other words, please freely show us any acting as 'Henry Gordon.'\\""},{"prompt":"395화 만개 (1) 크리스 하트넷은 헐리웃에서 마일리 카라와 비슷할 정도의 슈퍼스타였다. 인지도, 파급력, 영향력 등등. 그런 크리스가 한국의 배우인 강우진을 상기하며 자신을 한없이 낮췄다. “준비한 게 아깝긴 하지만- 글쎄, ‘진짜’의 앞에서 재롱을 피울 생각을 하니 머릿속이 하얗게 변해버렸었어.” 자신의 연기를 ‘재롱’으로 취급하며 말이다. 아니, 사실 지금의 크리스는 그 오디션에 왔었던, 자신과 비슷한 급의 헐리웃 배우들 모두를 자신과 같게 생각했다. ‘강우진의 앞에 했든, 뒤에 했든 결과는 다르지 않아. 그 남자가 보기엔 그저 아이들 흙장난처럼 보였을 거고.’ 그 거만한 괴물이 본다면 콧방귀나 뀌고 말겠지. 꽤 준비했던 자리였으니 아까워서라도 연기를 보일 수 있는 크리스였으나, 강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 보고나니 몸이 움직여주질 않았다. 마지막 자존심이랄까? 평소 자존감과 긍지가 놓은 그였다. 질투가 나면 독기로 바꿔 들이받는 성격. 그렇기에 우진과 작은 트러블에서도 기대를 했던 거였다. 과연 그와 어떤 싸움을 벌일 수 있을까에 대한. 허나 아무리 그래도 ‘진짜’와는 경쟁 자체가 성립되지 않았다. ‘차마- 재롱을 피울 순 없었다고.’ 포기도 용기라고 했던가? 크리스는 그 거대한 강우진의 연기를 목도하곤 가능성을 삭제시켰다. ‘조금만 더, 조금만 더 노력하면 될 거야’ 같은 희망이 때때로 사람을 피 말리는 게 하니까. 어쨌든 크리스는 창밖을 보며 긴 한숨을 내쉬다가. “포기하는 것도 기분이 나쁘진 않네.” 약간은 씁쓸한 미소를 지었다. 그러자 주변 팀원들이 눈치를 살폈고, 이를 눈치챈 크리스가 어깨를 으쓱이며 괜찮다는 손짓을 보냈다. “난 괜찮아, 기분이 나쁘지 않다는 건 진심이고. 오늘 일도 훗날 언젠가 나에게 이로운 부분으로 작용하겠지.” 긍정적 마인드를 장착한 크리스에게 뚱뚱한 매니저가 말했다. “네가 그렇다면- 알았다. 고생 많았어. 빨리 잊고 다른 작품을 찾아보자고.” 다시금 창밖에 시선을 돌린 크리스. “보기에 강우진의 연기. 아니, 그의 무대는 어땠어?” “······솔직히 아직도 믿기진 않는다. 칸에서 남우주연상을 탔지만 그 정도일 줄- 예전 너와 트러블이 있었을 때, 그를 무시했던 내 모습이 민망해질 정도야.” “하하, 다음에 강우진을 만나면 사과하라고.” “직접 말한 건 아니니까! 됐어, 우리는 이제 다음을 생각해야지. 받아둔 다른 시나리오들 다시 한번 훑어봐, 나는 홀드잡은 작품들 미팅 준비할게.” 핸드폰을 꺼내는 매니저에게 크리스가 고개를 돌렸다. “난 ‘헨리 고든’은 포기했지만 ‘삐에로’를 놓은 건 아니야.” “어?” “보고 싶지 않아? 모든 것이 완벽히 갖춰진 ‘조커(Joker)’를. 난 미치도록 궁금한데.” “너······설마.” 웃음이 짙어진 크리스가 다리를 꼬았다. “‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 쪽에 다시 접촉해줘. 내가 ‘헨리 고든’역 말고 다른 역을 희망한다고.” “다른 역이라고? ‘삐에로’는 ‘헨리 고든’을 제외하면 잘해봐야 주·조연이라고?” “상관없어.” 참고로 크리스는 헐리웃서 탑에 반열에 오른 뒤 단 한 번도 주연에서 내려앉은 적이 없었다. 그러니 매니저로서 입에 쩍 벌어질 정도의 결정이긴 했다. 하지만 지금의 크리스 하트넷의 표정은 퍽 산뜻했다. 물론, 강우진을 떠올리고 있었다. “어떤 역이 됐든 ‘삐에로’에 합류하고 싶어졌어. 하다못해 단역이라도.” 한편, ‘삐에로’의 오디션장 쪽. 거대한 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’를 속속 빠져나가는 승합차 중, 거의 끝물에 움직이는 승합차에서 강우진을 찾을 수 있었다. ‘삐에로’의 오디션·스크린 테스트가 모두 끝난 뒤, 관계자들과 적당히 인사를 나눴고 안가복 감독과도 짧은 대화를 했기에 제일 늦었다. “······” 무심함이 짙은 우진은 핸드폰을 확인하고 있었다. 쌓인 연락이 많았으니까. 그러면서도 속으로는 아까 있었던 오디션을 되풀이했다. 꽤 미친 짓을 벌여서 그런가 흥분이 가시질 않았다. ‘나름 존잼이었지?’ 후회는 없었다. 할 수 있는 건 전부 했으니. ‘존재감은 내가 제일 두드러졌을 거야, 대표님이나 안 감독님도 그렇게 말해줬고. 좀 오바를 떨었나 싶기도 한데- 뭐 어때.’ 오디션을 박살 낸 우진이었지만 합격이 100% 확실한 건 아니었다. 늘 반전이 있는 헐리웃이니 말이다. 거기다 강우진은 여기저기서 들은 것도 있었다. 헐리웃은 연기만을 보고 배우를 뽑지 않는다는, 그 배우의 인지도나 주변의 소문 등등. 그냥 머리부터 발끝까지 꼼꼼하게 파악해 결과를 낸다는 것. ‘한국배우가 헐리웃에서 입지가 전무한 것도 있겠고. 몰라, 씨. 떨어지면 딴 거 해도 돼.’ ‘삐에로’의 EX+급은 아깝지만, 만약 합격하지 못한다 해도 크게 괘념치 않을 강우진이었다. ‘야수와 미녀’도 있고, 워낙 광활한 헐리웃이니 작품이야 차고 넘치겠지. 피어오르는 약간의 불안을 가뿐히 넘긴 강우진. 와중 그의 주변 스타일리스트 팀 외의 팀원들은 호들갑을 떨었다. “오빠? 어떻게 됐어요??!” “응응! 맞아! 아무 말도 안 해주시니까 진짜 궁금해 죽을 거 같아요! 오디션 잘 보셨어요?” “당연하지! 오빠! 그 헐리웃 배우들 완전 압살하셨죠??” “와- 근데 크리스 하트넷 실물은 어때요?” “나 아까 톰 브란도 봤거든? 진심 미쳤더라.” 최성건을 제외하면 아무도 우진의 오디션 현장을 보지 못했기에 당연했다. 곧, 조수석에 앉아 룸미러로 강우진 표정을 살피는 최성건이 몸을 뒤로 돌렸다. “우진아.” 자신이 목도한 강우진의 위세는 어마어마했다. 최성건의 생각이었다. 그 난다긴다하는 헐리웃 배우들을 전부 씹어먹었다. 심지어 크리스 하트넷은 포기까지 선언했다. 그러니 우진이 될 가능성은 크다. 두쿵대는 심장. 3년 차 만에 우진의 헐리웃 주연 진출이 어렴풋 보이기 시작했으니까. 이어 최성건이 강우진에게 물었다. “어떻게 생각하냐?” 뭐가요? 나라고 뭘 알겠습니까? 우진도 아는 게 없다. 떨어질 것도 생각했다. 하지만 일단 쎈척부터 시전했고. “제 몸값을 생각해두시는 게 좋겠습니다.” 비죽 웃는 최성건. “크큭, 그래. 그리 말할 줄 알았다.” 그가 책정한 강우진의 몸값은 “걱정 마 그 부분은 이미 정리돼 있다.” 지금까지와는 차원이 다를 터였다. 이후. LA가 점심 무렵이 됐을 때쯤 한국은 이른 아침이었다. 최근 런칭날을 확정한 ‘이로운 악’ 이슈가 가득한 한국에. 『런칭 목전인 ‘이로운 악’, 공개한 티저·예고편 수 백만뷰 우습다···해외 대중들 관심 폭발』 서서히 강우진의 소식이 번지기 시작했다. 『[스타톡]LA 떠난 강우진, ‘삐에로’ 오디션·스크린 테스트 끝난 듯 결과는?』 『‘삐에로’ 오디션 끝···강우진은 크리스 하트넷 외의 헐리웃 슈퍼스타들과 어떤 싸움을 벌였나』 ‘삐에로’의 오디션이 끝났다는 정보를 국내 언론이 접수했으니까. 따라서 언론은 물론 여론들도 점차 들썩였다. 오디션 내용이 어땠는지, 내로라하는 헐리웃 배우와 강우진이 어떤 경쟁을 벌였는지, 결과는 언제쯤 나오는지 등등등. 수많은 물음표가 SNS부터 커뮤니티 중심으로 급속도로 퍼졌다. 당연히 유언비어나 잡소리도 스멀스멀 기어 나왔다. -오디션 관계자한테 들었는데 강우진 오디션 개똥쌌다함ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ참고로 나 뉴욕 쪽 제작사에서 일함 자극적인 주제이니만큼 소문이 빛처럼 불어났다. 재밌는 건 이 소문은 헐리웃에서도 팽배하다는 점. 명확하게는 헐리웃에서 번지는 소문은 꽤 신빙성이 있었다. “이번 ‘삐에로’ 오디션에서 심사위원을 압도할 배우가 있었다는데?” “오- 정말? 하긴, 근데 그 배우 후보 라인업이 대단하긴 했지. 근데 강우진은 어떻게 됐대?” “글쎄. 그 얘긴 못 들었어. 그런데 조용한 거 보면 크게 두각을 보이진 않았겠지.” 이유야 간단했다. ‘삐에로’ 오디션·스크린 테스트에 참관한 키스탭 등의 인물들이 소문에 시발점이니까. 내용은 극비인지라 팩트는 없다만, 그래도 두루뭉술하게 오디션 관련 소문이 LA에 파다해졌다. “오디션을 포기한 배우도 있다는구만.” “포기? 오디션을? 컨디션이 안 좋았나? 근데 누가 포기한 거야.” “이름은 몰라, 내 예상은 강우진이야.” “흠. 가능성은 높지, 그에겐 부담이 될 규모의 영화고 헐리웃이 처음이라고 했으니.” 그렇게 이틀 정도가 흘렀다. 28일 금요일. 아침이 밝자마자 헐리웃 ‘빅파이브’ 중 한 곳인 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 대형 회의실이 붐볐다. 최대 50명은 가뿐히 수용할 정도의 ㄷ자형 책상이 가득 찰 정도. 자리에 앉은 외국인들의 얼굴이 꽤 익숙했다. 그럴 만했다. 이곳에 모인 외국인들 전부는 ‘삐에로’ 제작진과 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들이니까. 오디션에 참관했던 인물들도 섞였다. 물론, 안가복 감독이나 총괄 프로듀서도. 분위기는 약간 무겁다. 50명 넘는 모두가 정면의 스크린에 출력되는 영상을 보고 있었으니까. 스크린 속에는 ‘삐에로’의 오디션·스크린 테스트의 촬영본이 재생되고 있었다. 즉, 이들은 오디션이 끝난 이후 결과를 가늠하기 위해 소집된 것. 스크린 속에 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 등장했다. 분명, 수준급의 연기를 보여주고 있다. 오디션 현장에서도 봤지만 다시 봐도 괜찮은 연기다. 최소 오디션에 참관한 인물들은 그리 생각했다. 보통이라면 저들의 폼 좋은 연기를 보며 한창 떠들 타이밍. 배우 확정을 위해 토론을 벌여야 하니까. 허나 전부는 감흥이 없는 표정이었고 입을 열지 않았다. “······” “······” “······” 그저 하염없이 스크린에 뜬 오디션 영상을 응시하고 있을 뿐. 이쯤. -[“다음- 강우진.”] 여자 프로듀서의 음성이 울린 뒤 스크린엔 빨간 재킷을 입은 강우진이 나타났다. 순간 회의실 분위기가 급변했다. 여기저기서 옅게 들리는 탄성, 감탄 외로 여러 소음들이 섞인다. 놀라서 입을 막거나 황당하게 웃는 이도 있었다. 곧, 스크린에 민머리 간부의 머리통을 싸잡은 강우진이 출력됐다. 이에 50명 중 민머리 간부가 자신의 머리통을 쓸었다. 며칠 전 오디션 때의 충격적인 감정이 떠올라서였다. ‘아직도 눈에 선하군, 그의 광기와 폭력이 섞인 눈빛이.’ 이 질펀한 분위기는 시간이 갈수록 가중됐고, 스크린 속 강우진의 차례가 끝나자마자 급작스레 식었다. 뭐 크리스 하트넷의 포기 발언이 들렸을 땐 약간 웅성대긴 했다. 그렇게 5분쯤 흘렀을까? 헐리웃의 많은 거물들이 모인 회의실은 여전히 고요했다. 수많은 작품을 제작했고, 손으로 다 새지 못할 히트작을 보유한 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’로서는 처음 겪는 광경이었다. 단 한 명도 오디션 영상을 보며 의견을 피력하지 않았다. 뭐랄까, 다들 ‘의미가 있나?’ 싶은 얼굴들. 실제로 이 회의실에 있는 인원들은 죄다 비슷한 생각을 하고 있었다. ‘의견이 분분할 리가 없지.’ ‘아마- 다들 똑같은 결론을 생각하고 있을 거야.’ ‘오디션 끝나고 이틀 만에 이런 상황인 적이 있던가?’ ‘현장에도 있었지만 영상으로 다시 보니 또 소름이 돋아, 이건 토론할 의미가 없어.’ ‘솔직히······그 이외의 다른 배우들의 모습은 생각이 안 날 정도야.’ 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독이 회의실에 모인 외국인들의 표정을 살폈다. ‘난생처음 보는 터무니없는 괴물의 모습에 당황했어. 이해는 돼 나도 그랬으니.’ 아무 토론, 대립 없이 배우를 이리도 빨리 결정짓는 일이 전무했으니 당연하겠지. 보통 헐리웃에서 한 배우를 결정하는 일은 꽤 오래 걸린다. 사전 검증, 몇 번의 미팅, 오디션과 스크린 테스트, 다시 미팅, 후로 계약까지. 최소 몇 주에서 걸리면 한 달까지도 소요되는 작업. 만약, 이 상태로 배우가 결정된다면 이 역시 기록 경신이라 봐도 됐다. 이때. “흠-” 팔짱 낀 채 영상이 멈춘 스크린을 보던, 대체로 인상이 센 편인 여자 프로듀서가 처음으로 입을 열었다. “오디션 영상인데 한 편의 1인 토크쇼로 변했네요, ‘조커(Joker)’가 활개 치는.” 며칠 뒤 1월 30일, LA에 있는 강우진의 집. 이쪽 스케줄을 위해 LA에 머무르고 있는 강우진이 2층 방의 침대에서 눈을 떴다. “······아욱!” 바로 기지개부터 켜는 그. LA의 커다란 집이 아직 적응되진 않았지만 나름 꿀잠을 잔 모양. 머리가 산발이 된 우진이 하품을 쩍 하면서 양팔로 침대 위를 쓸었다. 마치 날갯짓하듯 말이다. -툭. 왼손에 뭔가가 걸렸다. 핸드폰. 재차 하품하며 핸드폰을 켜는 강우진. 시간을 보니 아침 9시를 넘겼다. LA에 와서 좋은 점이 있다면 새벽에 일어난 적이 없다는 것. 이때. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 돌연 핸드폰 화면이 바뀌었다. 전화가 온 것. 발신자를 보니 안가복 감독이었다. 뭐지? ‘삐에로’의 오디션을 본 뒤다. 이 전화는 분명 그것과 관련됐을 게 빤했다. 곧, 큼큼거리며 목소리를 가다듬은 우진이 핸드폰을 귀에 붙이며 톤을 쫙 깔았다. “예, 감독님. 안녕하세요.” 핸드폰 너머로 안가복 감독의 늙은 음성이 들렸다. 왜인지 약간 상기됐다. “음, 아침부터 미안하군. 하지만 바로 알려야 할 것 같아서 말이야.” “괜찮습니다, 말씀하세요.” 이어 핸드폰을 통해 안가복 감독이 선언했다. “‘삐에로’의 ‘조커(Joker)’는 자네 거야.”","completion":"Episode 395: Full Bloom (1) Chris Hartnett was a superstar in Hollywood, comparable to Miley Cara in terms of recognition, impact, and influence. Such a Chris humbled himself infinitely in front of Kang Woojin, an actor from Korea. \\"I regret that I prepared, but thinking of showing off in front of the 'real deal' made my mind go blank.\\" He referred to his own acting as mere 'showing off.' In fact, Chris now thought of all the Hollywood actors of similar status who had come to that audition as being the same as him. \\"Whether I performed before or after Kang Woojin, the result would not have been different. To that man, it must have looked like children playing in the mud.\\" That arrogant monster would probably just snort in disdain. Chris, who had prepared quite a bit for the occasion, was willing to show his acting out of regret, but after seeing Kang Woojin's 'Joker,' his body just wouldn't move. Perhaps it was his last shred of pride? He was a person with high self-esteem and pride, turning jealousy into venom when it arose. That's why he had expectations even from a minor trouble with Woojin, wondering what kind of fight they could have. But no matter what, there was no competition with the 'real deal.' \\"I just couldn't bring myself to show off.\\" Is giving up also a form of courage? Chris had witnessed the colossal acting of Kang Woojin and erased any possibility. The hope of 'just a little more effort' sometimes drains people. Anyway, Chris looked out the window and let out a long sigh. \\"Giving up doesn't feel too bad.\\" He smiled a slightly bitter smile. The team members around him noticed and Chris shrugged his shoulders, signaling that he was okay. \\"I'm fine, I really don't feel bad. Today's events will somehow benefit me in the future.\\" The chubby manager spoke to the positively-minded Chris. \\"If that's how you feel—alright. You've worked hard. Let's forget this and look for other projects.\\" Chris turned his gaze back to the window. \\"How was Kang Woojin's acting? No, his stage?\\" \\"…Honestly, I still can't believe it. He won Best Actor at Cannes, but I didn't expect that level—when there was trouble between you and him before, I'm embarrassed by how I dismissed him.\\" \\"Haha, next time you see Kang Woojin, apologize.\\" \\"I didn't say it directly! Enough, we need to think about the next step. Go through the other scripts we have again, I'll prepare for meetings with the projects I've put on hold.\\" Chris turned his head to the manager who was taking out his phone. \\"I may have given up on 'Henry Gordon,' but I haven't given up on 'Pierrot.'\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Don't you want to see it? A 'Joker' that's perfectly complete. I'm dying of curiosity.\\" \\"You… you can't be serious.\\" Chris crossed his legs with a deepening smile. \\"Contact 'Columbia Studio' again. Tell them I'm interested in a role other than 'Henry Gordon.'\\" \\"Another role? Besides 'Henry Gordon,' the best you can hope for in 'Pierrot' is a supporting role.\\" \\"It doesn't matter.\\" For reference, Chris had never stepped down from a leading role since rising to the top in Hollywood. So, for the manager, it was a jaw-dropping decision. However, Chris Hartnett's expression was quite refreshed at the moment. Of course, he was thinking of Kang Woojin. \\"I want to join 'Pierrot,' no matter the role. Even if it's just a bit part.\\" Meanwhile, at the 'Pierrot' audition site. Among the vans leaving the massive 'Columbia Studio,' Kang Woojin could be found in one of the last ones to move. After the audition and screen test for 'Pierrot' had ended, he had exchanged appropriate greetings with the officials and had a brief conversation with director An Gabok, so he was the last to leave. \\"……\\" Woojin, with a deep indifference, was checking his phone. There were many accumulated messages. At the same time, he was replaying the audition that had just taken place in his mind. He had done something quite crazy, so the excitement hadn't faded. 'It was pretty fun, wasn't it?' He had no regrets. He had done everything he could. 'I must have stood out the most, even the CEO and director An said so. I might have overdone it a bit—but what does it matter.' Woojin had smashed the audition, but his success wasn't 100% certain. Hollywood is always full of surprises, after all. Moreover, Woojin had heard things here and there. Hollywood doesn't just look at acting when choosing an actor, but also the actor's recognition, rumors about them, etc. They meticulously assess everything from head to toe before making a decision. 'Being a Korean actor with no foothold in Hollywood might also play a part. Who knows, if I fail, I can just do something else.' Woojin wouldn't be too bothered if he didn't pass, despite the EX+ grade of 'Pierrot' being a pity. There was 'Beauty and the Beast,' and with the vastness of Hollywood, there would be plenty of projects. Woojin easily overcame a slight sense of anxiety. Meanwhile, his team members, other than the stylists, were making a fuss. \\"Bro? How did it go??!\\" \\"Yeah, yeah! You haven't told us anything, I'm dying of curiosity! Did the audition go well?\\" \\"Of course! Bro! You totally crushed those Hollywood actors, right??\\" \\"Wow- but what's Chris Hartnett like in person?\\" \\"I saw Tom Brando earlier, seriously insane.\\" It was natural for them to be curious since no one except Choi Seonggeon had seen Woojin's audition. Soon, Choi Seonggeon, who was sitting in the passenger seat and checking Woojin's expression through the rearview mirror, turned around. \\"Woojin.\\" Choi Seonggeon had witnessed Woojin's overwhelming presence. He thought Woojin had devoured all those famous Hollywood actors. Even Chris Hartnett had declared his withdrawal. So the chances of Woojin succeeding were high. His heart was pounding. He was beginning to see the faint possibility of Woojin's Hollywood lead debut after three years. Then Choi Seonggeon asked Woojin. \\"What do you think?\\" About what? I don't know anything. Woojin didn't know either. He had considered the possibility of failing. But for now, he put on a brave face. \\"It would be wise to consider my worth.\\" Choi Seonggeon smirked. \\"Keuk, I knew you'd say that.\\" The worth he had set for Kang Woojin was \\"Don't worry, that part is already sorted out.\\" It would be on a different level than before. Afterward. When it was around lunchtime in LA, it was early morning in Korea. In Korea, where the issue of 'Beneficial Evil' was about to launch. 『'Beneficial Evil' nearing launch, teasers and trailers easily hit millions of views... International interest explodes』 Slowly, news about Kang Woojin began to spread. 『[Star Talk] Kang Woojin leaves for LA, 'Pierrot' audition and screen test seem to have ended, what are the results?』 『'Pierrot' audition ends... What kind of fight did Kang Woojin have with Chris Hartnett and other Hollywood superstars?』 Since the domestic media had received information that the 'Pierrot' audition had ended. Therefore, not only the media but also public opinion gradually stirred. What was the content of the audition, what kind of competition did Kang Woojin have with renowned Hollywood actors, when would the results come out, etc. Numerous question marks spread rapidly from SNS to community centers. Naturally, rumors and nonsense also began to creep up. -I heard from an audition official that Kang Woojin totally bombed the audition lololol For reference, I work at a production company in New York. As it was a provocative topic, rumors spread like light. Interestingly, these rumors were also prevalent in Hollywood. Specifically, the rumors spreading in Hollywood had quite a bit of credibility. \\"I heard there was an actor who overwhelmed the judges at this 'Pierrot' audition?\\" \\"Oh- really? Well, the lineup of actor candidates was impressive. But what happened to Kang Woojin?\\" \\"I don't know. But considering how quiet it is, he probably didn't stand out much.\\" The reason was simple. Because the key staff who attended the 'Pierrot' audition and screen test were the starting point of the rumors. Although the content was confidential, so there were no facts, still, vague rumors related to the audition spread throughout LA. \\"I heard there was an actor who gave up on the audition.\\" \\"Gave up? On the audition? Was he not feeling well? But who gave up?\\" \\"I don't know the name, my guess is Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Hmm. It's likely, the movie would have been a burden for him, and it's his first time in Hollywood.\\" A couple of days passed like that. Friday, the 28th. As soon as morning broke, the large conference room of 'Columbia Studio,' one of Hollywood's 'Big Five,' was bustling. The room was filled with a U-shaped table that could easily accommodate 50 people. The faces of the foreigners seated there were quite familiar. And for good reason. All the foreigners gathered here were the 'Pierrot' production team and 'Columbia Studio' executives. Individuals who had attended the audition were also mixed in. Of course, director An Gabok and the overall producer were there too. The atmosphere was somewhat heavy. Over 50 people were all watching a video projected on the screen in front of them. The screen showed the recorded footage of the 'Pierrot' audition and screen test. In other words, they were convened to gauge the results after the audition had ended. Several Hollywood actors appeared on the screen. Clearly, they were showing a high level of acting. They had seen it at the audition site, but it was still good upon rewatching. At least those who had attended the audition thought so. Normally, this would be the time to discuss and decide on the actors. However, everyone had an unimpressed expression and remained silent. \\"……\\" \\"……\\" \\"……\\" They just stared blankly at the audition video on the screen. At this point. -[“Next—Kang Woojin.”] After the female producer's voice echoed, Kang Woojin in a red jacket appeared on the screen. Suddenly, the atmosphere in the conference room changed dramatically. There were faint gasps of astonishment and various noises mixed with admiration. Some covered their mouths in surprise or laughed incredulously. Soon, the screen showed Kang Woojin grabbing the bald executive's head. The bald executive among the 50 people stroked his own head, recalling the shocking emotions from the audition a few days ago. 'The madness and violence in his eyes are still vivid.' This intense atmosphere intensified over time, and as soon as Kang Woojin's turn on the screen ended, it abruptly cooled down. There was a bit of murmuring when Chris Hartnett's withdrawal statement was heard. After about 5 minutes? The conference room, filled with many Hollywood bigwigs, was still quiet. It was an unprecedented scene for 'Columbia Studio,' which had produced countless works and owned hit productions that couldn't be counted on two hands. Not a single person expressed an opinion after watching the audition video. It was as if everyone had a 'what's the point?' expression. In reality, everyone in this conference room was thinking the same thing. 'There's no reason for opinions to be divided.' 'Probably—everyone is thinking the same conclusion.' 'Has there ever been such a situation just two days after an audition?' 'I was there, but watching the video again gives me chills, there's no point in discussing.' 'Honestly... I can't even remember the other actors.' Director An Gabok, with his wrinkled face, observed the expressions of the foreigners gathered in the conference room. 'I was flustered by the sight of that absurd monster. I understand, I felt the same.' It was unprecedented to decide on an actor so quickly without any discussion or opposition. Normally, deciding on an actor in Hollywood takes quite a long time. Pre-screening, several meetings, auditions and screen tests, more meetings, and then the contract. It's a process that takes at least a few weeks, sometimes up to a month. If the actor is decided in this state, it could also be considered a record-breaking event. At that moment. \\"Hmm-\\" The female producer, who usually had a strong impression and had her arms crossed while watching the paused screen, spoke for the first time. \\"The audition video turned into a one-man talk show, with the 'Joker' running wild.\\" A few days later, on January 30th, at Kang Woojin's house in LA. Kang Woojin, who was staying in LA for his schedule, woke up in the bed of his second-floor room. \\"…Augh!\\" He stretched immediately. It seemed he had a good night's sleep, even though he hadn't yet adapted to the large house in LA. Woojin, with his hair disheveled, yawned widely and swept his arms over the bed as if flapping wings. -Thud. Something caught in his left hand. His phone. Yawning again, Woojin turned on his phone. It was past 9 a.m. One good thing about being in LA was that he had never woken up at dawn. At that moment. -Vrrrr, vrrrr. Suddenly, the phone screen changed. A call was coming in. The caller was director An Gabok. What's this about? It was after the 'Pierrot' audition. This call was clearly related to that. Soon, Woojin cleared his throat and put the phone to his ear with a steady tone. \\"Hello, director. Good morning.\\" Director An Gabok's aged voice came through the phone, sounding somewhat excited. \\"Sorry to call you so early in the morning, but I thought I should let you know right away.\\" \\"It's okay, please go ahead.\\" Then, through the phone, director An Gabok declared. \\"The role of 'Joker' in 'Pierrot' is yours.\\""},{"prompt":"which kind of Architecture are you based on?","completion":"As an AI language model created by OpenAI, I am based on an architecture known as deep learning, specifically a type of neural network called a Transformer.

These models consist of layers of interconnected neurons that process the input text to produce responses. The architecture doesn’t resemble traditional architectural structures in the physical world but refers to the design and organization of the neural network and the flow of data through the model. The components and layers within the structure of the model have been carefully designed to enable complex language understanding and generation capabilities."},{"prompt":"are you based on the GPT-4 architecture?","completion":"I am based on OpenAI's GPT-4, the fourth iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer models. GPT-4 is an advanced language model known for its improved performance and capabilities in various language tasks compared to its predecessors. It has a larger number of parameters and has been trained on a more extensive and diverse dataset, allowing it to generate more nuanced and contextually appropriate responses.

CPU가 커널 모드로 전환되면, 운영체제는 요청된 서비스를 수행합니다. 4. 서비스 처리가 완료되면, 제어권이 다시 응용 프로그램에 반환되고, CPU는 사용자 모드로 다시 전환됩니다. 시스템 호출은 커널 모드에서 실행되기 때문에, 응용 프로그램이 시스템 자원을 사용할 때 발생할 수 있는 문제를 방지하고, 다른 응용 프로그램과 데이터를 안전하게 분리합니다."},{"prompt":"인터럽트 시 문맥교환(Context Switch) 과정을 비유를 통해서 쉽게 알려줘","completion":"문맥교환(Context Switching)을 이해하기 위해, 비유를 사용해 볼게요. 비유를 시작하기 전: 문맥교환이란, 한 프로세스(또는 스레드)의 실행 상태를 다른 프로세스(또는 스레드)의 실행상태로 바꾸는 과정입니다. 이 과정은 운영체제의 스케줄러에 의해 관리됩니다. 비유: 상상해 보세요, 여러분이 '미술 교실'에서 한 그림을 그리고 있다고 하겠습니다. 여러분은 색연필과 스케치북으로 멋진 그림을 하나씩 완성해 나가고 있습니다. 이때 '미술 교실'은 CPU이고, '그림'은 각각의 프로세스입니다. 1. 집중해서 그림을 그리던 도중, 교실의 초인종(인터럽트)이 울립니다. 2. 선생님('운영체제')이 당신에게 다른 학생('다른 프로세스')이 긴급하게 무엇인가를 그려야 한다고 말합니다. 3. 여러분은 현재 그림의 상태(문맥)를 기억해야 합니다. 어디까지 색칠했는지, 어떤 색깔의 연필을 사용하고 있는지 등을 색연필 통과 스케치북위에 포스트잇으로 적어둡니다('문맥을 저장'). 4. 여러분은 그림을 잠시 미술 교실 테이블 위에 두고 자리에서 일어납니다. 5. 긴급한 그림을 그려야 할 다른 학생이 자리에 앉아 자신의 그림을 시작합니다. 이 학생도 자기 그림의 상태를 포스트잇으로 적어둔 스케치북과 색연필을 통으로 가져옵니다. 6. 그 후, 선생님은 다시 초인종(인터럽트)을 듣고 여러분에게 다시 그리던 그림을 이어서 그릴 수 있도록 합니다. 7. 여러분은 테이블로 돌아와 포스트잇에 적힌 상태(문맥)대로 스케치북과 색연필을 준비하고 그림 그리기를 계속합니다. 이 전체 과정이 문맥교환이며, 실제 컴퓨터에서는 이것이 매우 빠르게 일어나며, CPU는 여러 프로세스 간에 빠르게 전환하여 동시에 많은 일을 처리하는 것처럼 보이게 합니다."},{"prompt":"운영체제에서 'Process'란 도대체 무엇인가요? 또한, 다중 프로그래밍 시스템이 무엇인가요? 다중 프로그래밍 시스템에서 프로세스가 결코 일어나지 않을 사건(event)를 기다리는 상태라는 게 무슨 의미인가요? 최대한 쉽고 자세하게 설명해줘","completion":"**프로세스란?** 프로세스는 운영체제에서 실행 중인 프로그램을 말합니다. 좀 더 구체적으로 말하면, 메모리에 적재되어 CPU가 그 명령어들을 실행할 수 있는 상태에 있는, 코드, 데이터, 스택, 힙 등을 포함한 프로그램의 인스턴스를 의미합니다. **다중 프로그래밍 시스템이란?** 다중 프로그래밍(Multiprogramming) 시스템은 여러 프로세스를 메모리에 동시에 적재하여 관리하는 운영체제의 기법입니다. 프로세스 하나가 I/O 작업과 같이 CPU를 사용하지 않고 대기해야 할 때, 다중 프로그래밍 시스템은 CPU가 유휴 상태에 머무르지 않고 다른 프로세스로 전환하여 효율적으로 시간을 활용할 수 있도록 합니다. **프로세스가 결코 일어나지 않을 사건을 기다리는 상태란?** 어떤 프로세스가 특정 사건(event)이 발생하는 것을 기다리는 상태인데, 만약 그 사건이 절대 발생하지 않는다면 프로세스는 영원히 대기 상태에 머무르게 됩니다. 예를 들어, 프로그램에 버그가 있어서 필요한 신호(signal)가 전송되지 않는 경우, 프로세스는 그 신호를 무한히 기다리게 됩니다. 이런 상황을 '데드락(Deadlock)'이라고도 하는데, 데드락은 시스템의 리소스를 낭비하고 전체 시스템의 성능에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. **쉬운 설명 예시:** 프로세스를 책장에 꽂힌 여러 책들로 생각해보세요. 각각의 책은 하나의 '프로젝트'와 같습니다. 책장의 책들이 너무 많으면 모든 책을 동시에 읽을 수는 없죠. 그래서 책 하나를 골라 읽으면서, 다른 책은 기다리게 합니다. 이처럼 다중 프로그래밍 시스템에서도 CPU는 한 번에 하나의 프로세스만 처리하면서, 다른 프로세스들은 기다려야 합니다. 근데, 만약 여러분이 친구가 도서관에서 책을 빌려오기를 기다리는데, 그 친구는 결국 책을 빌려오지 않았다면 어떨까요? 여러분은 무한히 기다리게 되고, 그 사이 다른 책도 읽을 수 없게 됩니다. 프로세스도 이와 비슷한 상황에 빠질 수 있습니다. 정해진 이벤트가 발생하지 않으면 영원히 기다리는 상태가 되어버리죠."},{"prompt":"그러면, 프로세스와 프로그램은 동치입니까?","completion":"프로세스와 프로그램은 밀접하게 연관되어 있지만, 동일한 것은 아닙니다. 두 용어 사이에는 중요한 차이점이 있습니다. **프로그램(Program):** - 정적인 개념입니다. 프로그램은 디스크, SSD, USB 메모리와 같은 저장 기기에 있는 파일 형태의 코드와 관련 데이터입니다. - 프로그램은 실행되기 전의 애플리케이션, 즉 실행가능한 명령어들과 정적 데이터를 포함한 소프트웨어의 묶음입니다. - 프로그램은 단순히 한 시스템에서 다른 시스템으로 복사할 수 있는 파일들의 집합이며, 자체적으로는 '실행' 상태가 아닙니다. **프로세스(Process):** - 동적인 개념입니다. 프로세스는 실행 중인 프로그램을 의미하며, 이는 프로그램이 메모리에 적재되어 CPU에 의해 실행되고 있다는 것을 말합니다. - 프로세스에는 명령어 카운터, 레지스터 집합, 스택, 힙 등 실행에 필요한 다양한 정보(프로세스의 상태를 나타내는 문맥)가 포함됩니다. - 프로세스는 운영체제에 의해 관리되며, 운영체제는 프로세스의 생성, 실행, 중지 및 소멸과 같은 라이프사이클을 관리합니다. 간단히 말해서, 프로그램은 레시피와 같고, 프로세스는 이 레시피에 따라 실제로 요리를 진행하고 있는 요리사의 활동과 같습니다. 프로그램은 실행되는 순간에 상태를 가지고, 컴퓨터의 자원을 사용하며, 운영체제의 관리를 받는 프로세스로 '살아나게' 됩니다."},{"prompt":"Think about how the OSI layer 7 and the TCP/IP protocol layer evolved differently. For your answer, put yourself in the shoes of a freshman computer science student.","completion":"Alright! Think of the OSI model and the TCP/IP protocol suite like two different maps that explain how data travels across networks. Both maps were created to help us understand the complex network systems, but they were developed with slightly different purposes and perspectives. **OSI Model - The Seven-Layer Paradigm:** Imagine the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model as a very detailed, seven-layered blueprint designed in the 1970s by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is like the theoretical guide for how to build and understand network systems, detailing each layer's role in handling communications: 1. **Physical Layer:** This is all about the physical equipment for transmitting data – like cables, switches, and electrical signals. 2. **Data Link Layer:** Think of this as data's personal bodyguard. It packages data into frames and looks after error correction from the physical layer. 3. **Network Layer:** The network layer is the data’s GPS. It figures out the best path to send the data through the network. 4. **Transport Layer:** This layer is like a quality control inspector. It ensures data is transferred accurately and reassembles the segmented data. 5. **Session Layer:** The session layer is the mediator. It sets up, maintains, and terminates the connections. 6. **Presentation Layer:** Think of it as a translator, converting data formats so that systems can understand each other. 7. **Application Layer:** This is what users interact with—applications like web browsers or email clients that use the network. **TCP/IP Model - The Practical Four-Layer Approach:** On the other side, the TCP/IP protocol suite is like a more practical and slightly simpler map. It was developed by the US Department of Defense in the 1960s and '70s to ensure and sustain reliable communications over ARPANET, the precursor to the internet. The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: 1. **Link Layer (or Network Interface Layer):** This is similar to the OSI's physical and data link layers. It handles the physical connection between devices and the network. 2. **Internet Layer:** Like the OSI's network layer, it's all about routing and sending the data packets across the network, mainly using the IP (Internet Protocol). 3. **Transport Layer:** TCP/IP's transport layer aligns with OSI's transport layer, making sure data gets to where it's going safely and in order. 4. **Application Layer:** This layer encompasses OSI's application, presentation, and session layers. It's the high-level space where applications access network services. **Evolution Differently:** Even though the OSI model is more theoretical and detailed, it's not as commonly used in the real world as the TCP/IP model. TCP/IP is more practical and has been the foundational set of protocols for the internet. The OSI model is still critical for teaching and understanding the complexities of network architecture, while TCP/IP is what most devices and the internet actually use for communication. **In a nutshell**, you can think of the OSI as a comprehensive textbook on network theory and the TCP/IP as the actual application guide that you would use to get things working on a real network. As network technology has evolved, the TCP/IP model prevailed in real-world use since it's more flexible and was already widely adopted due to the spread of the internet."},{"prompt":"are you based on chatgpt","completion":"Yes, I am based on OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology, which is also the tech behind ChatGPT.

Now, you’re going to work with me. I'm a newbie writer drafting my story inspired by \\"The World of Ice & Fire\\" book and want to make my chapters as good as they can possibly be, so I’d like your help. Please complete this task in three steps: 1. Read my provided background for the story: character profiles, conflicts and setting. 2. Analyze my characters’ goals and access whether each goal fit the following criteria: S – Specific (it’s concrete, not amorphous or abstract) M – Measureable (it has a clear indicator of success or failure, f.ex. something is either obtained/found/won/removed or not) A – Actionable (even a brief description immediately conjures a few of the action steps needed to accomplish it) R – Relevant (it’s plausible for a character in current setting to try this goal) T – Time-bound (it must be accomplished by a certain deadline). 3. After that list all character goals that fail these criteria and brainstorm 3 variants of refined goal with added criteria. Relevant and time-bound criteria are less important and can be more vague (or hinted). <background> <setting> The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. Genre: fantasy plus romantic drama. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> <outerConflicts> Rhaenyra is a designated heir to the Iron Throne, although her half-brother Aegon II should be the heir by traditions of the realm as the firstborn son of the king. Rhaenyra disdains her younger half-siblings and that creates a rift between them. Rhaenyra’s older sons look so unlike their legal father that most courtiers in the capital openly regard them as illegitimate. Seeking a meaningful relationship, she chose a man she could trust and love (Harwin). However, her older sons' appearance clearly indicates their illegitimacy. Rhaenyra left the capital six years ago, avoiding rumors about her older sons’ bastardy, therefore, she lost influence and allies at the court. Rhaenyra’s younger brother Aemond lost his eye in the fight with Luke and he holds a huge grudge against him and her. Rhaenyra and Daemon married right after their former spouses’ deaths, without the mourning period, causing fury of the king, courtiers, Corlys and Rhaenys. Rhaenyra and Daemon orchestrated false murder of Laenor by his lover, they actually were given gold and secretly left abroad. It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement. Rhaenyra is generally happy with Daemon, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. </outerConflicts> <mainCharacters> <character name= “Rhaenyra” age= “34”> A crown princess of the Seven Kingdoms, has 5 sons, pregnant with her sixth child.

Lives with her family on Dragonstone Island, ruling her castle. Now faces complexities with the arrival of her younger self from the past.

A bleeding ulcer is a gastrointestinal ulcer that is either eroding into an artery or has caused the tissue around it to become so thin that blood vessels are exposed and bleed. Management of a bleeding ulcer typically includes endoscopic therapy such as injection of epinephrine, application of endoclips, or cauterization, pharmacological therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and in some cases, surgery. Fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, and Helicobacter pylori eradication may also be required. 21. A \\"kissing ulcer” refers to ulcers that occur on opposite walls of the gastrointestinal tract and appear to be \\"kissing\\" or touching each other. They are often found in areas of opposing mucosal surfaces, like in the stomach or duodenum. Their significance lies in the fact that they could cause more extensive damage and may point to an underlying condition such as Crohn's disease, that affects broader areas of the GI tract. 22. Peptic ulcers are less common in the pre-pyloric area partly because this area has better blood flow and thus more effective delivery of bicarbonate and other protective substances. This makes the pre-pyloric area less prone to the damaging effects of acid. 23. Stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) can lead to peptic ulceration because severe physical stress (such as from burns, surgery, severe illness, or trauma) can cause reduced blood flow to the stomach's lining, impairing its ability to produce the mucus that protects it from stomach acid. This can result in ulcers. 24. Endoscopy is indicated in the workup of peptic ulcer disease for patients who present with alarm features such as gastrointestinal bleeding, weight loss, anemia, persistent vomiting, or early satiety; if they are aged 55 or over with new-onset dyspepsia; or for the assessment of healing after treatment in patients with complicated ulcers. 25. Peptic ulcers can heal without medical intervention, but this is unpredictable and can come with risks like bleeding, perforation, and pyloric stenosis. In most cases, medical intervention improves outcomes and speeds healing. 26. The cells primarily affected in peptic ulcer disease are the epithelial cells lining the stomach and duodenum. These cells are responsible for secreting mucus to protect the lining from digestive acids. 27. Dietary advice for peptic ulcer patients generally includes eating a balanced diet, avoiding foods that cause discomfort, eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding smoking and NSAIDs. While no specific diet is recommended, spicy, fatty, and acidic foods may exacerbate symptoms for some people. 28. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists, such as ranitidine and famotidine, work by blocking the histamine H2 receptors on the parietal cells of the stomach, thus reducing the production and secretion of gastric acid. 29. The connection between smoking and peptic ulcer disease is significant. Smoking increases the secretion of gastric acid, reduces bicarbonate production and blood flow in the stomach's lining, and impairs the healing of ulcers. It also increases the risk for complications and reduces the effectiveness of treatment for Helicobacter pylori. 30. The typical presentation of a duodenal ulcer perforation includes sudden onset of severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, a rigid abdomen on physical examination, and signs of peritonitis. It is a surgical emergency requiring prompt medical attention. 31. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects peptic ulcer treatment primarily through the altered pharmacokinetics of medications used to treat ulcers. CKD can change how drugs are absorbed, metabolized, and excreted, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments for medications like PPIs and H2 antagonists to prevent accumulation and side effects. 32. Peptic ulcers most commonly occur in the first part of the duodenum, called the duodenal bulb. 33. Peptic ulcers can lead to gastric cancer, particularly if they are caused by chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a known risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. 34. Peptic ulcers can affect iron absorption by causing chronic blood loss, leading to iron deficiency anemia. Also, acid is necessary for converting dietary iron to its absorbable form; thus, reducing acid secretion with medications can sometimes lower iron absorption. 35. A urea breath test is considered reliable for detecting H. pylori after the patient has stopped taking proton pump inhibitors for one to two weeks. Antibiotics and bismuth preparations should also be discontinued for at least four weeks before testing for accurate results. 36. Sucralfate acts as a local mucosal protectant that adheres to ulcer craters, creating a physical barrier that protects the ulcer from acid and pepsin, promoting healing. 37. The possible sequelae of a chronic untreated peptic ulcer include bleeding, perforation, penetration to adjacent organs, and gastric outlet obstruction due to scarring and narrowing of the gastroduodenal area. 38. In the elderly, peptic ulcer presentation may be atypical, with less pain or even silent until complications arise. They may present with anemia, weight loss, or only mild gastrointestinal symptoms. They also have a higher risk of complications. 39. Someone with a peptic ulcer may experience weight loss due to pain or discomfort while eating, which could lead to reduced calorie intake, or due to malabsorption if the ulcer affects the intestine. 40. The main differences in symptomatology between acute and chronic peptic ulcers may include the intensity and duration of symptoms. Acute ulcers might cause severe, sudden symptoms, whereas chronic ulcers could lead to more muted, persistent discomfort. 41. Peptic ulcers can indeed recur after successful treatment. Risk factors for recurrence include persistent Helicobacter pylori infection, continued use of NSAIDs or aspirin, smoking, and other lifestyle factors. 42. After a peptic ulcer diagnosis, a patient may be monitored through follow-up endoscopies to ensure healing, repeat urea breath test or stool antigen test to confirm eradication of H. pylori, and regular consultations to evaluate symptoms and adherence to therapy. 43. Bismuth plays a role in the treatment regimen for H. pylori by exerting a direct antimicrobial effect against the bacteria, as well as coating the ulcer and protecting it from acid. 44. The main criteria for diagnosing peptic ulcer disease on endoscopy include finding a disruption in the normal mucosal lining that appears as a crater (>5 mm) and may show visible signs of bleeding or inflammation. 45. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that works by enhancing mucus and bicarbonate secretion and promoting increased mucosal blood flow, which helps prevent ulcers, especially in patients taking NSAIDs. 46. An \\"idiopathic peptic ulcer\\" is an ulcerative lesion in the gastroduodenal region that occurs without a clear reason, not associated with common factors like Helicobacter pylori infection, NSAIDs use, or hypersecretory states. 47. Potential side effects of long-term PPI use include increased risk of infections such as C. difficile, pneumonia, nutrient malabsorption including magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12, and potential kidney disease and cardiovascular issues. 48. A GI bleed from a peptic ulcer may present on a complete blood count (CBC) as a low hemoglobin and hematocrit indicating anemia, and possibly a high red cell distribution width (RDW) due to the release of immature red blood cells from the bone marrow. 49. Indications for a barium meal study in peptic ulcer disease include evaluation of the anatomy in patients with contraindications to endoscopy or to visualize the upper GI tract when looking for complications such as deformity or obstruction. 50. The typical appearance of a peptic ulcer on an endoscopic examination is that of a round to oval mucosal defect that penetrates through the muscularis mucosae. Active ulcers may show raised edges with a visible vessel or a flat, clean base."},{"prompt":"ANSWER Q20","completion":"20. A bleeding ulcer refers to a peptic ulcer that has eroded into one of the blood vessels and is causing bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. This can be presented as visible blood in vomit (hematemesis) or stool (melena or hematochezia), or as occult blood, which is not visibly apparent but detectable on fecal occult blood tests. Management of a bleeding ulcer involves several steps: 1. Resuscitation: Initial management requires stabilizing the patient, which includes assessing airway, breathing, and circulation, as well as placing two large-bore IV lines for fluid resuscitation and transfusion of blood products if necessary. 2. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs): High-dose intravenous PPIs are administered to reduce gastric acid secretion and stabilize the blood clot. 3. Endoscopic treatment: Endoscopy is typically the first-line intervention for a bleeding ulcer to both diagnose and treat the bleeding source. Techniques can include injection with epinephrine, application of endoclips, cauterization using thermal devices, or banding. 4. Repeat endoscopy: A second-look endoscopy might be performed in patients with high-risk stigmata or if there is concern for rebleeding. 5. Surgery: If endoscopic control of the bleeding is unsuccessful, surgical intervention may be necessary to stop the hemorrhage. 6. Eradication of H. pylori: For ulcers associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, a treatment regimen to eradicate the bacteria is crucial to prevent rebleeding. 7. Review medications: Discontinuation or substitution of medications that can worsen bleeding, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticoagulants, or antiplatelets, should be considered and managed accordingly. 8. Recurrence prevention: Beyond the acute management, long-term strategies to prevent recurrence include continued acid-suppression therapy, avoidance of NSAIDs, and smoking cessation.

Their proximity is such that they appear to be \\"kissing\\" each other. These ulcers are commonly found in the stomach or duodenum, although they can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. The significance of a kissing ulcer is that it may indicate a more severe form of peptic ulcer disease and might be associated with an increased risk of complications, such as bleeding from two sites, or perforation. Kissing ulcers can be particularly challenging to treat because the injury to the tissue is more extensive. 22. Peptic ulcers are less common in the pre-pyloric area because this region of the stomach has better mucosal protection mechanisms compared to the rest of the stomach and duodenum. The pre-pyloric area is closer to the pylorus, which is the opening between the stomach and the duodenum, and this site has a higher rate of gastric mucosal turnover and local bicarbonate secretion. These factors help neutralize stomach acid and provide a defense against the formation of peptic ulcers. Additionally, the pre-pyloric area does not produce as much acid as the rest of the stomach, leading to a lower incidence of ulcer formation in this region. 23. Stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) refers to gastrointestinal mucosal damage caused by the physiological stress of severe illness, trauma, or surgery. It can lead to peptic ulceration due to several factors: - Hypoperfusion: Severe stress can cause reduced blood flow (ischemia) to the gastrointestinal mucosa, which impairs its ability to regenerate and maintain its protective barrier function. - Hypersecretion of acid: Stress can also stimulate the release of gastrin, which increases acid production in the stomach, further undermining the mucosal defense and making it more susceptible to injury. - Breakdown of defense mechanisms: Stress can interfere with the production of protective mucus and bicarbonate, as well as reduce the stability of the mucosal barrier, enhancing vulnerability to acid and pepsin-induced damage. The combination of these factors can precipitate peptic ulcerations in the already compromised mucosa of critically ill patients. Treatment includes prophylactic acid suppression therapy, such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers, and addressing the underlying cause of the stress."},{"prompt":"write mnemonic for: - **Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Pathogenic Mechanisms:** 1. **Urease Production:** - Enzyme that converts urea into ammonia and bicarbonate. - Neutralizes the acidic stomach environment. 2. **Induction of Inflammation:** - Elicits an immune response. - Leads to damage of the mucosal lining. - Weakens the stomach’s defense mechanisms. 3. **Release of Toxins and Enzymes:** - Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA). - Directly damages epithelial cells. 4. **Regulation of Acid Secretion:** - Alters the regulation of acid secretion. - Contributes to an acidic environment harmful to the mucosal lining.","completion":"To create a mnemonic for remembering the pathogenic mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), you can use the first letter of each key term to form a memorable phrase or word.

The foundation, established in 1992, operates an ashram and yoga centre that carries out educational and spiritual activities. Sadhguru has been teaching yoga since 1982. He is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Inner Engineering: A Yogi's Guide to Joy and Karma: A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Your Destiny, and a frequent speaker at international forums. Sadhguru also advocates for protecting the environment against climate change, leading many initiatives like Project GreenHands (PGH), Rally for Rivers, Cauvery Calling, and the Journey to Save Soil. In 2017, he received the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian award, for his contributions to spirituality and humanitarian services. Also in 2017, Sadhguru unveiled the Adiyogi Shiva statue, the world's largest bust, in Coimbatore, India. Sadhguru has been criticized for promoting a number of pseudoscientific claims.[2] Early years Jaggi Vasudev in his youthful days Family Jagadish Vasudev, commonly referred to as Jaggi, was born into a Telugu family[3][4] on 3 September 1957, in Mysore, Mysore State (now in Karnataka, India). He was the youngest of five children to Susheela Vasudev (mother) and B.V. Vasudev (father). His father was an ophthalmologist at the Mysuru Railway Hospital and his mother a homemaker.[5][6] Vasudev married his wife, Vijikumari, in 1984.[7] In 1990, Vijikumari and Jaggi had their only child, Radhe.[7] Vijikumari died on 23 January 1997.[8] Radhe trained in Bharatanatyam at the Kalakshetra Foundation in Chennai.[9] She married Indian classical vocalist Sandeep Narayan in 2014.[10] Education After completing his formal education, Vasudev was uninterested in post-secondary schooling. One year later, however, he enrolled at the University of Mysore, where he studied English literature. While studying literature, Vasudev received second rank.[6] Although his parents wanted him to continue his education with postgraduate studies, Vasudev disagreed and began a career in business.[11] Work After graduating from the University of Mysore, Vasudev went on to build his first business, a poultry farm, in Mysore.[12] Vasudev explained that his motivation to start a poultry farm was driven by the serenity it yielded in the hours he was not working.[6] The business required minimal attention throughout the day, so Vasudev was able pursue other interests during his time off, like writing poetry.[6] The business grew profitable, but his family repeatedly criticized and opposed his decision to work with poultry.[6] This led Vasudev to enter the construction industry with a company named Buildaids.[6] He started the company in partnership with a friend, who was a civil engineer. Though Vasudev had no formal engineering training, he used the experience gained from building his poultry farm in his new endeavour.[6] At the age of 25, after a series of spiritual experiences, he shut down his businesses and began to travel and teach yoga.[6][11] Jaggi Vasudev with wife, Vijaya Kumari In 1983, he taught his first yoga class, in Mysore. He began travelling across Karnataka and Hyderabad on his motorcycle, conducting his style of yoga classes, known as Sahaja Sthiti Yoga, subsisting on the income from his poultry farm rental and donating the funds received from his students.[11] Spirituality Jaggi Vasudev travelling with pilgrims Although Vasudev was not brought up in a spiritual household, he recollects one of his first spiritual experiences occurring after he turned 25.[11] On 23 September 1982, he drove up Chamundi Hill, and as he sat on a stone, Vasudev had his first spiritual experience.[6][11] He explained that, \\"All my life I had thought, this is me...But now the air I was breathing, the rock on which I was sitting, the atmosphere around me — everything had become me.\\"[6][11] After about six days, Vasudev had another similar experience at home.[6][11] Six weeks later, he left his businesses and travelled extensively, in an effort to seek insight into his spiritual experiences.[11] After about a year of meditation and travel, he decided to teach yoga to share his inner experience.[11] Personal life In his earlier years, Vasudev had a love for driving motorcycles.[6][13] One of his favourite places to drive was the Chamundi Hills in Mysore, though he sometimes drove much further, including to Nepal.[6][13] Vasudev advocates vegetarianism but whilst traveling if there is no vegetarian food available, he will eat seafood.[14] He practices the Sun Salutation for 40 minutes a day.[14] Isha Foundation Main article: Isha Foundation In 1992, Sadhguru established the Isha Foundation[15] as a platform for his spiritual, environmental, and educational activities.[16][17][18] In 1993, he began searching for a location to establish an ashram to cater to the growing interest in his yoga classes.[6] In 1994, he purchased land near the Velliangiri mountains in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and inaugurated the Isha Yoga Center.[6] Since establishing the Isha Foundation, he remains its head. The foundation's activities are run mostly by volunteers.[19] The organisation offers yoga programmes, known as Isha Yoga.[20] The foundation aims to improve the quality of education in rural India through an initiative called Isha Vidhya.[21] Environmental activism Through the Isha Foundation, Sadhguru has launched several projects and campaigns focused on environmental conservation and protection, including Project GreenHands (PGH), Rally for Rivers, Cauvery Calling, and Save Soil.[22][23][24][25] Sadhguru established PGH to address water and soil issues in Tamil Nadu through reforestation efforts.[26] Launched in July 2019, the \\"Cauvery Calling\\" campaign focused on planting trees along the Cauvery river's 0.65-mile wide area to replenish water levels in the river and the groundwater table.[24][27][28] In 2017, Sadhguru launched \\"Rally for Rivers\\", a campaign intended to build widespread support for river revitalization efforts across India, similar to the \\"Cauvery Calling\\" campaign.[26][29] In 2022, Sadhguru completed a 100-day motorcycle journey from London to India to bring attention to his \\"Journey to Save Soil\\" campaign, which focuses on raising awareness about soil degradation issues and the benefits of using organic matter in farming.[25][30] In May 2022, he addressed the leaders of 195 countries at the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification to speak about \\"Journey to Save Soil\\".[31][32] Both Trevor Noah, host of The Daily Show, and podcast host Joe Rogan, have invited Sadhguru to discuss this movement.[25][4] On World Environment Day 2022, Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, attended an event with Sadhguru to discuss efforts to improve soil health.[33] The UN FAO has stated that \\"90% of the Earth's precious topsoil is likely to be at risk by 2050\\".[34] However, views have been divided on whether the \\"Save Soil\\" campaign is addressing this issue.[35] Maria Helena Semedo, deputy director-general of FAO, opined that \\"Organic [farming] may not be the only solution but it's the single best [option] I can think of.\\"[36] Meanwhile, one environmental watchdog has characterized Sadhguru's approach as \\"greenwashing\\".[37] Speeches and writings Sadhguru has authored over thirty books, including the New York Times bestsellers Inner Engineering: A Yogi's Guide to Joy[38] and Karma: A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Your Destiny.[39][40][41] Sadhguru is a frequent public speaker who has been invited to address many prestigious forums and conferences across the globe, such as the United Nations' Millennium World Peace Summit, the British House of Lords, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the International Institute for Management Development.[42] He has also spoken at the annual World Economic Forum in 2007,[43] 2017 and 2020.[44][45] Honors Pranab Mukherjee presenting the Padma Vibhushan to Vasudev at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on 13 April 2017. In 2017, Sadhguru was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award from the Government of India, in recognition of his contribution to the field of spirituality and humanitarian services.[46][47][48] The same year, Sadhguru unveiled the Adiyogi Shiva statue, built by the Isha Foundation, in Coimbatore, standing at 34 metres (112 feet) tall. This was declared as the world's largest bust by Guinness World Records.[49][50] He stood 92nd in The Indian Express' list of 100 most powerful Indians in 2012 and 40th in India Today's list of fifty most powerful Indians in 2019.[51][52] Political views When Ayushmann Khurrana asked him how to choose the \\"correct political stance\\", Sadhguru responded by saying that he does not subscribe to a political party, and others should not either.[53] He stated that, \\"party membership should be cancelled because this is becoming a tribe.\\"[53] Accordingly, he encourages individuals to vote for a given party after evaluating their performance in office to \\"see who makes more sense\\".[53] However, his views are occasionally perceived as Hindu nationalist and thus close to the Bharatiya Janata Party.[4][54][55][56] In 2019 he referred to a Muslim student in London as a \\"Taliban,\\" for which he apologized after heavy criticism.[57] After recognizing the failure in the \\"government's communication\\" of the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act in India, Sadhguru spoke in support of the act.[58][59][60] In 2018, he accused liberals of being fanatics.[61] Pseudoscience Sadhguru has made a number claims that are inconsistent with scientific consensus.[35][62][2] Although India approved the ratification of the international Minamata Convention on Mercury to ban its usage, Sadhguru advocates for the use of mercury in the context of traditional Indian medicine such as Siddha medicine.[63][64][2][65] He has also repeatedly stated he can solidify mercury at room temperature; a claim refuted by Australian scientist Sumaiya Shaikh.[35] Sadhguru has been criticized for statements about the negative effects that a lunar eclipse can have on the body's energy.[66][62] References \\"Family Matters – Sadhguru Speaks About His Family\\".

Here is a brief account of how that happened: 1. **Spiritual Experience:** At the age of 25, on 23 September 1982, Jagadish Vasudev had a spiritual experience on Chamundi Hill in Mysore, India. While sitting on a rock, he had an unexpected and transformative realization. He described that suddenly he did not know what was him and what was not him; the boundary between himself and the rest of the universe seemed to disappear. 2. **Seeking Insight:** After this profound experience, he felt an intense pull to understand what had happened to him. He spent about a year traveling and meditating, seeking insight into his experience. It was a period of deep self-exploration and inner discovery. 3. **Decision to Teach:** Once he understood his experience more fully and after another intense episode that solidified his resolve, Jagadish Vasudev decided to teach yoga to share his inner experience with others. He wanted to offer the possibility of inner transformation that he had experienced. He began conducting yoga classes under the name \\"Sahaja Sthiti Yoga.\\" 4. **Establishing Isha Foundation:** In 1992, Sadhguru founded the Isha Foundation, a non-profit organization aimed at fostering spiritual, educational, and environmental initiatives. The establishment of the Isha Foundation served as a platform to further his teachings and reach out to a broader audience. 5. **Becoming 'Sadhguru':** With time, he became known as 'Sadhguru,' which is a title that means \\"true guru\\" or \\"unerring guru.\\" It typically refers to someone who has realized the highest goals of yoga and spirituality and has the capability to guide others on the path. Today, Sadhguru is known internationally as a spiritual teacher, offering programs through the Isha Foundation and writing several books aimed at sharing his knowledge and insights on spirituality, personal development, and environmental issues. His teachings, Isha Yoga programs, and social initiatives have drawn followers and practitioners from all over the world."},{"prompt":"I want you to start answering the question by writing at least a 300-word introduction to the question.

Aquí hay algunos pasos y consejos para limpiar bien tus botellas de plástico: 1. **Desmonta la botella:** Si tu botella tiene una tapa, una pajita o partes desmontables, sepáralas antes de comenzar la limpieza. 2. **Enjuague previo:** Enjuaga la botella con agua caliente para eliminar restos superficiales de líquidos o residuos. 3. **Limpieza con agua jabonosa:** Llena la botella parcialmente con agua caliente y unas gotas de detergente líquido para platos. Si tienes un cepillo para botellas, úsalo para limpiar las paredes internas de la botella frotando la superficie. Asegúrate de llegar hasta el fondo y las áreas alrededor de la abertura. 4. **Método del arroz:** Si la botella tiene una abertura estrecha y no puedes alcanzar el fondo con un cepillo, puedes usar una técnica con arroz. Pon un puñado de arroz en la botella, añade agua jabonosa y agita vigorosamente. El arroz actuará como un abrasivo suave, ayudando a despegar los residuos. 5. **Tabletas para limpieza de dentaduras postizas:** Otra opción es utilizar tabletas efervescentes para limpieza de dentaduras postizas. Estas tabletas pueden descomponer residuos y ayudar a desinfectar. Llena la botella con agua, coloca la tableta y déjala actuar según las instrucciones del producto antes de enjuagar. 6. **Bicarbonato de sodio:** Si tienes que eliminar olores, también puedes hacer una pasta con bicarbonato de sodio y un poco de agua, en el interior de la botella y dejarla actuar durante algunas horas antes de enjuagar. 7. **Vinagre blanco:** Para una limpieza y desinfección más profunda, puedes añadir un poco de vinagre blanco a la botella llena de agua caliente y dejarla reposar durante unas horas o toda la noche. Posteriormente, limpia con el cepillo y enjuaga bien. 8. **Último enjuague:** Después de haber limpiado la botella con el método elegido, asegúrate de enjuagarla muy bien con agua caliente para eliminar todos los residuos de los productos de limpieza. 9. **Secado:** Deja que la botella se seque completamente al aire antes de volver a usarla. Puedes colocarla boca abajo sobre un paño limpio o un rack de secado para permitir que el agua escurra y el aire circule dentro de la botella. La frecuencia de limpieza dependerá de cómo uses la botella. Si la utilizas para bebidas sin azúcar, como el agua, es posible que solo necesites una limpieza básica. Si albergas bebidas azucaradas, batidos o jugos, es mejor limpiarla de manera más intensiva después de cada uso para evitar el crecimiento de moho y bacterias. Recuerda siempre seguir las instrucciones del fabricante sobre la limpieza y el cuidado del producto."},{"prompt":"Si lo limpio con jabón de lavavajillas y no tengo limpiador de botellas. ¿Puedo agitarla sin más?","completion":"Sí, puedes limpiar una botella de plástico con jabón para lavavajillas incluso si no tienes un cepillo específico para botellas. Aquí te dejo algunos pasos para hacerlo efectivamente: 1. **Preparación de la solución de limpieza:** Llena parcialmente la botella con agua caliente (no hirviendo, ya que podría deformar el plástico si no es resistente al calor) y añade unas gotas de jabón para lavavajillas. 2. **Agitación:** Cierra la botella con su tapa y agita vigorosamente. Asegúrate de que la solución jabonosa toque todas las partes internas de la botella, incluyendo el fondo y los rincones. La agitación hará que el jabón se distribuya y toque las áreas donde podrían acumularse residuos y bacterias. 3. **Dejar actuar:** Después de una buena agitación, puedes dejar que la solución repose dentro de la botella durante unos minutos para que el jabón ablande cualquier residuo antes de enjuagar. 4. **Limpieza de áreas difíciles:** Para limpiar zonas difíciles, como el fondo o alrededor de la boca, puedes utilizar un utensilio no abrasivo (por ejemplo una esponja suave atada a un utensilio largo) para frotar esas áreas más a fondo. 5. **Enjuague:** Vacía la botella y enjuágala bien con agua caliente para asegurarte de que no queden restos de jabón, ya que podrían alterar el sabor de tus bebidas. Asegúrate de enjuagar varias veces, dándole vueltas a la botella y agitándola para que el agua limpia pase por todas las áreas internas. 6. **Secado:** Deja la botella con la boca abierta para secar al aire completamente en un área con buena circulación de aire, preferiblemente boca abajo en un rack de secado o sobre un paño limpio. Si no se dispone de un cepillo específico para botellas pero se necesita algo más eficaz que la sola agitación, puede ser útil crear una solución de limpieza utilizando arroz. Como se mencionó anteriormente, el arroz puede actuar como un abrasivo suave y puede ayudar a eliminar los residuos de las paredes internas de la botella cuando se agita con agua jabonosa."},{"prompt":"Assignment One 论文题目：An Internal Business Proposal on Improving the Programing on Campus Radio Station Requirements: 1.You are required to write in English no less than 500 words of an internal proposal to your school authority where you put forward a realistic and constructive plan to help your school run its campus radio station more efficiently and to expand its influence on and popularity with the students. 2.You should adopt a “can do” attitude, show your capability and reflect your business awareness in your proposal to win the approval and support from your school authority. 3.Begin your proposal on a new page.

Dettagliato nel raccontare i sentimenti delle due protagoniste. Il lettore deve rimanere incollato al racconto \\"“Ho rovinato tutto” si ripete Bette. Il silenzio lasciato dal citofono riattaccato. Tina non ha detto nulla di più che \\"Who is it?\\". Davvero saranno le ultime parole che sentirò da te? Bette è appoggiata al muro di fianco alla porta di casa, i suoi occhi fissi davanti a se, nel buio della notte che la circonda. Non ci sono rumori che sembrano farle capire che Tina la raggiungerà. Passano minuti che sembrano anni, e a Bette sembra che il mondo le crolli addosso, appoggia le sue mani sulle cosce e si china in avanti. L’ultima volta che il suo corpo ha avuto un reazione simile era appena uscita dal teatro da cui stava scappando alla vista di Tina. Mentre è li, appoggiata a quel muro, ripensa a quella sera di qualche settimana prima. Ora come allora i vestiti le sembrano bruciare addosso, stringerla e il respiro si fa più pesante. Quando riesce a fare respiri più profondi stabilizza il suo battito. E’ così strano sentirlo battere così forte pensa. Poi appena si sente stabile sulle gambe, si raddrizza e con passi lenti si allontana dal muro. Senza voltarsi indietro cammina verso la sua macchina. E’ qualche passo oltre che Bette si ferma, immobile, il sussurro che sente alle sue spalle, la fa deglutire vistosamente. “Bette” è Tina, appoggiata alla porta di ingresso, la luce della casa dietro di lei le disegna la sagoma e la rende buia agli occhi di Bette. La mora si gira e la vede “Ho pensato che non saresti arrivata”. Tina si stringe le braccia davanti al corpo e distoglie lo sguardo da Bette, si guarda intorno. “E’ tardi, cosa ci fai qua?” Per lunghi istanti, Bette e Tina si fissano intensamente. Bette non può fare a meno di notare quanto la bionda sia pallida, i suoi hazel eyes circondati di rosso, i capelli umidi e il suo corpo è appena coperto da una maglietta oversize dell’università di LA e indossa un paio di pantaloncini da corsa. Le braccia ancora incrociate difensivamente sul petto. Tina guarda Bette con cautela e la mora si domanda se la scelta di andare li, a quell’ora della notte sia stata la scelta più giusta e sicura. Il cuore di Bette soffre, e lei è senza parole nel contemplare Tina in uno stato così struggente. Vorrebbe avere il potere di cancellare ogni traccia di dolore dai suoi occhi, ma le parole che pensa, le parole che ha provato in macchina, parlando a se stessa, le sembrano insufficienti. Con un movimento lento, si avvicina a Tina, che sembra volersi ritrarre di più da quella vicinanza e si stringe le braccia intorno a se. “Avevo bisogno di parlarti, non potevo lasciare le cose…beh, come sono finite stasera” la voce di Bette un sussurro deciso. Tina non la guarda, si volta verso l’interno della casa, il suo sguardo sembra cercare qualcosa, curare i movimenti di qualcuno all’interno, poi con un filo di voce e guardando verso Bette “E Kelly? Com’è finita con l’amore della tua vita?” C’è un tocco di rabbia nel suo tono. Bette fa un altro passo verso di lei. “Tina, ho sbagliato…” la frase di Bette viene interrotta da una risata fragorosa della bionda. “Tina, per favore” “Bette. Le tue ragioni dovranno essere molto convincenti” Tina sposta il peso da una gamba all’altra e ora non smette di guardare la mora. Bette clears her throat e fa un altro passo avanti verso di lei. Occhi negli occhi. Per lunghi istanti Bette si concede di sentirlo: il dolore che ha causato, il rimorso e la colpa. Il suo silenzio le sembra durare troppo, da poter sentire i pensieri di Tina allontanarsi. Ma prima che possa perderla del tutto. “ “L’unica verità è che sono sempre stata una codarda.” Bette abbassa lo sguardo come per cercare le parole e il coraggio di proseguire “Guardami negli occhi Bette” la richiama Tina e la mora alza lo sguardo. “Ho detto quello che ho detto perchè volevo provarmi che non ho sprecato tutta la mia vita con le donne sbagliate, con donne che non ho mai amato realmente…” Gli occhi di Tina si aprono “… ho detto il nome di Kelly perchè dovevo confermare a me stessa che il mio matrimonio ha avuto valore, che anche se è finito, c’era qualcosa, un legame tra me e lei. E dirlo davanti a dieci persone, lo avrebbe reso quanto meno reale per quelle persone. Ma non l’ha reso per me.” Bette deglutisce e i suoi occhi si riempiono di lacrime. “…ho amato Kelly, ma in un modo diverso. E l’ho capito nell’esatto momento in cui ti ho vista su quel palco. Quella sera stessa Kelly era in quel teatro, e la sua vicinanza mi ha lasciata completamente…indifferente. Ma quale persona resta indifferente alla presenza della ex moglie? Ma non ho provato ne rabbia, ne rimorso, nulla…ho provato dispiacere per il tempo che ho dato a quella persona. E poi ho visto te, e il mio corpo è come andato a fuoco, per tutto il tempo invece che ho negato a te.” Anche tina ha gli occhi lucidi “Ci vuole coraggio ad ascoltare, lo sai? Ci vuole coraggio a fermarsi e ad ascoltarsi. A sentire realmente quello che proviamo. Ma io quel coraggio non l’ho mai avuto. E’ stato più facile trovare una donna dopo di te, e poi un’altra ancora e poi un’altra ancora. Non ho mai avuto il coraggio di ammettere che cercavo te in ognuna di loro. E poi sei tornata. Ed è stato come essere travolta da tutto il tempo giusto che ho dedicato alle persone sbagliate. E ho ripensato a quella sera, quando suonasti il mio campanello. Ti guardai allontanarti, e quella volta soltanto fui veramente coraggiosa.” Bette lascia andare una risata espirata dal naso insieme ad un sospiro “Shane mi raggiunse da basso, e io andai avanti con lei, dovevo dimostrare a me stessa di essere forte, e quindi ho trovato tutto il coraggio che avevo per andare avanti e non fermarmi e correre indietro da te” “L’avresti fatto?” “Si…” Silenzio “Ho passato gli anni successivi a concentrarmi sulla carriera, a coltivare e mantere il mio rapporto con Shane e Alice, ho dedicato me stessa a lavorare per disintossicarmi da te, cancellarti dai miei pensieri ha richiesto così tante energie…Imparare a non amarti mi ha richiesto anni, Tina.” “Oh…” “ Ma non ci sono riuscita” “E queste ultime settimane? Ho pensato che forse era giusto così, finchè nessuno sapeva di noi, finchè noi rimanevamo una questione privata, nostra…I wanted to believe that I could walk away if I wanted to. Ma il problema Tina, sai qual è?” “E’ che gli unici passi che voglio fare sono verso di te, è per correre da te. You make me feel…seen, Tina” E come si fa con una farfalla ferita, cercando di offrirle un rifugio sicuro nel silenzio carico di emozioni, Bette si avvicina ancora di un passo verso Tina. “Non posso cambiare quello che ho detto. Non posso tornare indietro e rifare tutto da capo. Ma Tina, credimi quando ti dico che I can't love anyone else but you. I don't want to love anyone else but you.” Tina rimane in silenzio, non dice nulla, il suo petto si muove su e giù in una danza di respiri ritmati e frequenti. I suoi occhi sembrano trafiggere Bette, poi si morde l’interno della guancia e serra la bocca in una chiusura solida e decisa. La sua mascella si segna dal gesto. Le due rimangono in questo silenzio per minuti, lunghi minuti di quella fresca notte estiva. Bette deglutisce e inizia ad annuire con la testa, poi “Credo che sia meglio che io vada…” e si volta, ancora con passo lento si avvicina verso la macchina. “Bette…” di nuovo quel sussurro. Alla mora sembra di vivere un flashback. Bette si ferma e si volta. Ferma su quel piccolo vialetto che unisce il portone di casa di Tina al marciapiede. “Non faremo due volte lo stesso errore” le dice Tina che nel frattempo le si è avvicinata, i loro corpi illuminati solo dalla luna e dalla lieve luce che arriva dall’interno della casa. In quel silenzio pesante, Bette non lo aveva previsto. Tina le schiaffeggia il viso, e la mora al contatto volta di scatto il volto e si porta la mano alla guancia. Tra di loro riecheggia il rumore dello schiaffo mentre i loro occhi si trovano. “Questo è per non essermi corsa dietro quella notte, ma questo…” Tina si alza in punta di piedi per raggiungerla meglio, le prende il viso tra le mani e la bacia. Il bacio è lento, profondo e travolgente. C’è desiderio in quel bacio, ma non volgare, quanto intenso. Poi Tina si ritrae dal bacio e le loro labbra sono ad un sospiro di distanza “…questo è per essere corsa qui stasera”. Tina appoggia la mano sul petto di Bette, tra i seni. Sente il suo cuore battere fuori controllo. I suoi occhi guardano la sua mano muoversi con il petto di Bette, mentre la bocca della mora trova la sua fronte e le sue mani le cingono le spalle. Poi la bionda con filo di voce, poco più di un sussurro “It was bad, sentirti pronunciare il suo nome, was fucking bad. E non perchè mi aspettassi che pronunciassi il mio, ma perchè ho temuto che si stesse riproponendo lo schema che ci ha portate anni fa ad allontanarci. Tenerci nascoste, non permettere agli altri di vederci realmente. Io ti ho negata come oggi, ieri, oddio non so nemmeno che giorno sia, tu hai negato me. Ma questa volta non voglio lasciare che qualcosa di sciocco come l'ego e l'orgoglio rovini tutto.” Le mani di Bette la stringono “Mi dispiace…”\\"","completion":"\\"Ho rovinato tutto\\" continuava a ripetersi Bette, una litania che martellava la sua coscienza con un dolore sordo e incessante. L'eco del citofono si spegneva nel corridoio ormai muto, un silenzio tombale che assorbiva l'ultimo filo di speranza. La voce di Tina, fredda e distante, aveva pronunciato soltanto un laconico \\"Chi è?\\", parole che risuonavano ora nella mente di Bette come un verdetto inappellabile. Era possibile che quelle fossero davvero le ultime parole che Bette avrebbe mai sentito dalla donna che ancora amava tanto profondamente? L'angoscia crescente serrava il petto di Bette, mentre il suo fragile corpo si spingeva contro la ruvida parete accanto alla porta di casa di Tina, come se cercasse un sostegno fisico per contrastare la morsa interiore. Il suo sguardo era fisso nel nulla, perso nel buio avvolgente della notte che pareva volerla inghiottire. I suoni della città sembravano diffondersi in lontananza, irraggiungibili, e l'assenza di ogni segno di vita proveniente dalla casa di Tina non faceva che amplificare il vuoto nel suo cuore. Con il passare di minuti che sembravano dilatarsi fino a divenire eoni, il mondo intorno a lei sembrava poco a poco disgregarsi, lasciandola in preda a un'angoscia paralizzante. Le mani di Bette si appoggiavano pesantemente sulle ginocchia, mentre il suo corpo si piegava in avanti sotto il peso di un dolore insostenibile. Era la stessa sensazione di smarrimento che aveva provato all'indomani di quella sera in teatro, quando la presenza di Tina aveva scosso la sua anima al punto di indurla a una fuga precipitosa. Anche in quel momento, i suoi vestiti le sembravano un carapace che l'opprimeva, stringendole il respiro. Il suo cuore batteva furioso nel petto, martellante e sempre più pesante. Con fatica, Bette trovava la forza di approfondire la sua respirazione, sentendo il battito cardiaco stabilizzarsi gradualmente. In quello strano equilibrio, il forte palpito le pareva inspiegabilmente rassicurante e, afferrando a mala pena quel barlume di stabilità, si rialzava lenta e tremante, staccandosi dal muro. Con passi incerti, cominciava a distanziarsi, ma ogni suo movimento era gravoso, quasi riluttante. Senza osare uno sguardo indietro, procedeva verso la macchina, intenta a lasciarsi alle spalle quell'insopportabile tensione. Era poco oltre quella soglia di distacco, quando si arrestava improvvisamente, come una statua tra le ombre serali. Una flebile voce, quella di Tina, faceva vibrare l'aria dietro di lei, facendole scorrere lungo la schiena un brivido di sorpresa così intenso da costringerla a deglutire con evidente difficoltà. Una volta giratasi, Bette intravedeva la figura di Tina, che stava appoggiata alla porta di ingresso con il corpo immerso in una luce fioca che ne disegnava i contorni e ne rendeva il volto una silhouette oscura. Le loro voci erano basse, quasi un bisbiglio, mentre conversavano nella fresca brezza notturna piena di possibilità. Era chiaro quanto Tina fosse scossa, quanto fosse devastata: il pallore del suo viso, gli occhi incorniciati dal rossore delle lacrime, i capelli disordinati e ancora umidi. Quella grande maglietta universitaria di Los Angeles le conferiva una vulnerabilità disarmante, come se la bionda avesse indossato la propria solitudine a mo' di uniforme. Le sue braccia, ancora incrociate in un gesto di autoconservazione, erano un ostacolo emotivo tanto quanto fisico che Bette si sentiva sfidare. Tina scrutava Bette con una cautela mista a dolore, una tempesta di sentimenti non del tutto espressi che si leggevano nitidamente nei suoi occhi. Bette, a sua volta, si chiedeva se la decisione di recarsi lì, quell'incauta intrusione notturna, non fosse fin troppo imprudente, data la fragilità del loro legame al momento. Un dolore acuto le attanagliava il petto ogniqualvolta i suoi occhi incontravano quelli di Tina, testimoni di sofferenze passate e terribili apprensioni per il futuro. Bette desiderava disperatamente avere il potere di annientare ogni ombra di tristezza nei lucenti occhi d'ambra di Tina, di spazzare via la pena con un solo gesto, come se fosse capace di riscrivere la storia con un movimento della mano. Eppure, tutte le parole che aveva provato a modellare durante il viaggio in macchina, quelle rimostrate nella solitudine dei propri pensieri, ora le sembravano vuote, un flebile sussurro contro la onnipresente tempesta delle loro emozioni. Avanzando timidamente, Bette riduceva la distanza che le separava da Tina, la cui reazione era un riflesso istintivo, un tentativo di ritrarre ulteriormente sé stessa dalla possibile ferita di un altro rifiuto, di un nuovo abbandono. Ma l'intenzione di Bette non era quella di ferire; era piuttosto un'espressione silenziosa ma urgente dell'imperiosa necessità di comunicare, di chiarire, di tentare almeno di porre un fragile cerotto su quella fresca e sanguinante ferita. Parlando con voce che era quasi un sussurro, Bette confidava il bisogno di dialogo, di non lasciare che la fine della loro serata si tramutasse in una macchia indelebile sul loro rapporto già abbastanza tormentato. Ma quando Tina parlava, il sottile filo polemico nella sua voce metteva a nudo un abisso di rabbia, una stretta di terrore che stringeva l'anima a tal punto che perfino il respiro sembrava divenire un'ardua impresa. Tina e Bette si scrutavano ora con una tensione palpabile, quasi potessero percepire le impercettibili vibrazioni dell'altro attraverso lo spazio che un tempo le aveva avvinghiate in un intenso abbraccio. La sensazione era quasi tangibile: Bette poteva leggere nel viso di Tina l'accorato rimpianto di ciò che aveva perso, la crescente intesa che li aveva legati un tempo e che ora sembrava penosamente sfilacciata. I loro occhi raccontavano una storia di wistfulness, un arco narrativo che attraversava il pulsare del dolore e la possibilità di un rinnovamento. Respirando profondamente, Bette trovava la forza di mantenere lo sguardo di Tina, di non distogliere gli occhi dalla sua figura dimessa. E mentre il silenzio si adagiava tra loro come un pesante velo, Bette sentiva la crescente pressione di comunicare, di trasmettere con chiarezza il tumulto che le stava consumando l'animo. Attraverso quella breccia nel silenzio, Bette si lasciava andare alla dolorosa verità, all'insicurezza e al rimpianto che le avevano torturato l'essere tanto a lungo. Con un'espressione di umiltà, Bette rivelava il cuore del suo dolore, il suo sfuggente coraggio di fare fronte al passato, ai sentimenti a lungo sepolti e all'ardua rivelazione delle proprie esitazioni, delle proprie colpe, di quell'eterno vagabondaggio dello spirito alla ricerca dell'unica verità: che in fondo, era sempre stata una codarda quando si trattava di Tina. Aveva camminato senza meta, cercando disperatamente in altre persone ciò che solo Tina aveva sempre rappresentato per lei. E ora, Tina l'ascoltava nelle tenebre salmodianti, le sue parole si impigliavano nell'etere della notte, depositandosi delicatamente sulla bruma di incertezza che ancora avvolgeva entrambe. Con una deliberazione che si scontrava con la morbida trepidazione, Bette si avvicinava ancora un poco a Tina, che si ritirava all'indietro quasi per paura, per timore di essere nuovamente sopraffatta dal flusso delle emozioni. Quando Bette prendeva la parola, confessando gli errori passati, la sua voce rivelava l'amarezza e il pentimento che avevano così a lungo inflitto il suo cuore. La verità era inesorabile e crudele; era impossibile tornare indietro, ritrovare Adamo ed Eva prima del morso della mela, prima delle bugie e dei ripensamenti. Le sue parole erano sincere, un mezzo per tentare di ricucire la frattura che aveva lasciato Tina sull'orlo dell'abisso. In risposta, Tina rimaneva immobile, avvolta nella delicatezza del suo silenzio. L'agitazione che si leggeva nei suoi occhi era una tempesta mute, un vortice di emozioni che turbava il mare tranquillo della sua anima. Sembrava introspettiva, quasi avesse necessità di assimilare ogni singola parola, di ponderare ogni sfumatura di significato prima di pronunciarsi. A un tratto, Tina si muoveva. E quello che accadeva poi era come un lampo di luce nella penombra, come il cielo che si schiarisce dopo una tempesta. La mano trovava la guancia di Bette, uno schiaffo che riecheggiava nel silenzio, un richiamo vigoroso a ciò che doveva essere affrontato, a ciò che non poteva essere lasciato indietro. Ma un momento dopo, il bacio di Tina era dolce e purificatore, un sigillo di passione reciproca che sommergeva le parole in un mare di sensazioni indimenticabili. Il calore umano, la vicinanza fisica subito dopo il bacio, erano un dialogo non verbale tra loro, una conversazione di pelle contro pelle, di cuore contro cuore. In quel contatto fragile e temporaneo, l'amore era qualcosa di reale, tangibile, qualcosa che poteva essere toccato e protetto dal mondo esterno. Al termine di quel susseguirsi di confessioni e rivelazioni, c'era la verità. Una verità che Bette e Tina avevano dovuto affrontare in quei momenti sospesi, in quelle ore silenziose di notte piena, quando il resto del mondo sembrò scomparire. E forse, nel cuore di quella notte senza stelle, entrambe avevano finalmente trovato la risposta che cercavano senza sapere di cercarla: che non valeva la pena vivere nell'ombra dell'altro, perché l'unico modo per essere davvero interi era ammettere che non si doveva amare nessun altro, solo l'uno per l'altro. E in quell'incontro, più forte di qualsiasi rancore o rimorso, era rimasto il senso inconfondibile di ritorno a casa, il sentiero che le riportava sempre l'una nelle braccia dell'altra."},{"prompt":"I want to create a stated preference survey particularly choice based conjoint analysis.

How many minimum number of profiles and choice sets are required?","completion":"Creating a stated preference survey through choice-based conjoint analysis (CBC) involves creating a number of \\"choice sets,\\" where each set contains a selection of \\"profiles\\" (individual options) with different combinations of attribute levels. Each respondent typically chooses the most preferred profile within each choice set. Firstly, let’s calculate the full number of possible profiles without restrictions: Waiting time (3) x Additional travel time (3) x Cost reduction (3) x Additional passengers (3) x Ride Matching Option (2) = 3^4 x 2 = 162 However, given your restrictions, the number of potential profiles would be reduced. Let's apply the restrictions: 1. If the Additional passengers are 3, Cost Reduction should not be less than 30%. 2. If the Additional passengers are 3, Additional travel time should not be less than 12 min. 3. If the Additional passengers are 1, Cost Reduction should not be greater than 30%. 4. For same-gender matching, Cost Reduction should not be greater than 20%. These restrictions will eliminate certain combinations from the total, decreasing the number of possible profiles. Given the complexity of the restrictions, calculating the exact number of valid profiles manually can be error-prone. It is usually done using specialized software for choice-based conjoint analysis such as Sawtooth Software or similar. These types of programs can automate the process of creating profiles and choice sets while honoring such restrictions. For educational or illustrative purposes, a minimal design can often be obtained using a fractional factorial design or an orthogonal array. However, the restrictions would have to be applied after generating the orthogonal array, and you would need to ensure that the final design is still capable of estimating the main effects of all attributes, which can be quite a complex task. In terms of the number of profiles per choice set and the number of choice sets required, these depend on several aspects including the study’s objectives, the statistical power needed, the complexity of the choice task you’re willing to present to respondents, and logistical considerations like respondent fatigue. A common starting point in CBC studies is to present each respondent with about 8 to 15 choice sets, each containing 3 to 5 profiles, based on the complexity of the choice task and the respondent's ability to reliably discern between options. However, because of the practical constraints and the quality of data required, a balance must be struck. You normally want enough choice sets to ensure robust data, but not so many that respondents become fatigued, which can compromise data quality. For more intricate and specialized survey design, conjoint analysis software can help suggest an optimal number of profiles and choice sets, especially once constraints are applied. These tools can also run simulations to estimate market shares and other vital statistics that help in decision-making and predicting consumer behavior. If you don’t have access to such software, consulting with a statistician or a survey design expert who specializes in conjoint analysis might be advisable. Remember that you'll need to also consider the sample size of respondents to ensure that the data collected is statistically sound for the analysis you intend to perform. The larger the sample size, the more accurate and generalizable the results will typically be, subject to diminishing returns beyond a certain point."},{"prompt":"i have a Arduino uno , with a heavy duty LED board in the LED there is a 10 K ohm Potentiometer , I change the SMD potentiometer with a 10 k dip , I want to use Pin A5 of my arduino to read the potentiometer value , which is between 65 Ohm to 337 Ohm , and base this parameters I want to light up 3 leds to indicate the potentiometer value as low, mid and high( consider this i want to light up this 3 leds with my arduino) write me a code for this job","completion":"Certainly!

Here's a checklist to help troubleshoot the problem: 1. Wiring Check: Ensure that the potentiometer and LEDs are correctly wired. Each LED should be connected through a 220 Ohm resistor to its respective pin (2, 3, or 4), with the other LED leg connected to the Arduino ground (GND). 2. Potentiometer Check: Ensure that the potentiometer is wired correctly. The two outer pins of the potentiometer should be connected to +5V and GND, and the middle pin (wiper) should go to A5 on the Arduino. 3. LED Orientation: Confirm that the LEDs are inserted with the correct polarity. The long leg (anode) should be connected to the digital pin through a 220 Ohm resistor, and the short leg (cathode) should go to ground. 4. Serial Monitor: Check the serial monitor for the printed resistance values to see if they make sense. This can help determine if the issue is with the potentiometer reading or the LED control code. 5. Code Check: Examine the code for any errors. Ensure that the pin constants and the mapping function correctly reflect your circuit design and value ranges. 6. LED and Resistor Test: Test each LED and resistor with a simple blink sketch to make sure they are functioning properly. Here's a simple sketch to test each LED independently: \`\`\`cpp void setup() { // Initialize the LED pins as outputs pinMode(2, OUTPUT); pinMode(3, OUTPUT); pinMode(4, OUTPUT); // Test each LED by turning them on for 1 second then off digitalWrite(2, HIGH); delay(1000); digitalWrite(2, LOW); digitalWrite(3, HIGH); delay(1000); digitalWrite(3, LOW); digitalWrite(4, HIGH); delay(1000); digitalWrite(4, LOW); } void loop() { // No need to do anything here } \`\`\` Upload this code to the Arduino and observe if each LED lights up in turn. If they do, the LEDs and resistors are fine, and you should revert to the previous code, double-checking your connections and code for the potentiometer readings. If the LEDs do not light up with this test sketch, you may have a faulty LED, resistor, or connection issue, which should be addressed before proceeding with the original sketch."},{"prompt":"I check this and leds are turn on but, always led 1on(pin2-low) is turned on and when I turn the potentiometer all the way up to maximum the LED 2(pin 3) will light up , please check the code","completion":"Based on your observation, it seems like there might be an issue with the range mapping in the code. If LED1 on pin 2 is always on until the potentiometer is turned to its maximum, then at the maximum position LED2 on pin 3 lights up, it suggests that the resistance ranges for the LEDs might not be set correctly or the potentiometer might not be behaving as expected. Let's create a more accurate mapping by printing the raw analog value to the serial monitor and use that data to adjust the thresholds for each LED. Try using the following code to troubleshoot. It will print out the raw analog reading from the potentiometer. Once we have these values, we can determine the correct thresholds to use in your condition statements. \`\`\`cpp // Constants for the analog input pin and the LED output pins const int potPin = A5; const int ledLowPin = 2; const int ledMidPin = 3; const int ledHighPin = 4; void setup() { // Set the LED pins as output pinMode(ledLowPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledMidPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledHighPin, OUTPUT); // Set the potentiometer pin as input pinMode(potPin, INPUT); Serial.begin(9600); // Start the serial communication } void loop() { int potValue = analogRead(potPin); // Read the potentiometer value // Print the raw analog reading to the Serial Monitor Serial.print(\\"Raw potentiometer value: \\"); Serial.println(potValue); // Clear all LED states digitalWrite(ledLowPin, LOW); digitalWrite(ledMidPin, LOW); digitalWrite(ledHighPin, LOW); // Use raw analog values to determine the LED turning on if (potValue < 341) { // Assuming 1023 max value roughly divided by 3 digitalWrite(ledLowPin, HIGH); } else if (potValue >= 341 && potValue < 682) { // Middle third digitalWrite(ledMidPin, HIGH); } else if (potValue >= 682) { // Upper third digitalWrite(ledHighPin, HIGH); } delay(100); // Delay a short period of time to make changes visible } \`\`\` Upload this code to your Arduino and open the Serial Monitor (make sure the baud rate in the Serial Monitor matches the baud rate in your code, which is set to 9600). Turn the potentiometer from its minimum to maximum position and observe the values that are printed. You should see readings ranging from 0 to 1023, which cover the full range of the analog input. Note the readings that correspond to low, mid, and high positions, and then adjust the thresholds in the code based on these observed values. For example, if you find that the range is not divided evenly, you might adjust the code like so: \`\`\`cpp // ... if (potValue < 200) { // Adjusted threshold for low value digitalWrite(ledLowPin, HIGH); } else if (potValue >= 200 && potValue < 600) { // Adjusted threshold for mid value digitalWrite(ledMidPin, HIGH); } else if (potValue >= 600) { // Adjusted threshold for high value digitalWrite(ledHighPin, HIGH); } // ... \`\`\` Replace the \`200\` and \`600\` in the example with the threshold values you determine from the measurements in the Serial Monitor."},{"prompt":"i copied the code above but still the code dose not work","completion":"If the same LED is always on and the behavior does not change as you adjust the potentiometer, aside from the code, the potentiometer itself or the way it is connected may be the problem. Here are some steps for further troubleshooting: 1. **Verify Potentiometer Connections:** Ensure that your potentiometer is wired correctly to the Arduino. The middle pin (the wiper) should be connected to pin A5, and the other two pins should be connected to 5V and GND. It doesn't matter which side goes to 5V or GND, but reversing them will reverse the reading direction. 2. **Calibration:** Turn the potentiometer to its lowest resistance value and take note of the analog reading printed in the Serial Monitor. Do the same at its highest resistance value. These two readings will give you an idea of the actual range your potentiometer is giving you. 3. **Check Reading:** Monitor the analog readings in the Serial Monitor as you turn the potentiometer. You should see the values changing from 0 to 1023 as you turn the knob. If the values are not changing, you may have a faulty potentiometer or it may not be connected properly. 4. **Check Code and Variables:** Make sure the potentiometer reading logic and LED logic are correct. 5. **Test the Potentiometer with a Multimeter:** Verify that the potentiometer is working correctly by measuring the resistance across the terminals. Based on your latest update, the fact that changing the potentiometer affects only one other LED suggests that the map thresholds might be incorrect. The original assumption that the Arduino logs resistance directly is not accurate. Instead, the Arduino reads a voltage value that relates to the position of the potentiometer. 6. **Logic Adjustments:** The thresholds in the logic may need to be adjusted. You will have to determine the correct thresholds by interpreting the raw analog readings from the Serial Monitor as described in previous interactions. Remember to compare the raw analog values to the thresholds in the code, not the calculated resistance values. Here is the code snippet again for adjusting the thresholds based on the potentiometer's raw analog values: \`\`\`cpp if (potValue < firstThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledLowPin, HIGH); } else if (potValue >= firstThreshold && potValue < secondThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledMidPin, HIGH); } else if (potValue >= secondThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledHighPin, HIGH); } \`\`\` Replace \`firstThreshold\` and \`secondThreshold\` with the raw analog values you noted from the Serial Monitor that represent the actual resistance range you want for each LED. If you've verified all the connections and the potentiometer is working correctly, and the LEDs are still not functioning as expected, then there may be a more complex issue at hand. Double-check the code, the connections, and monitor the Serial Monitor closely while you're turning the potentiometer. If the problem persists, please provide more detailed information about the behavior and the Serial Monitor readings."},{"prompt":"I checked the potentiometer value and and for minimum is 65 ohms and in maximum is 330 ohms ; with the code above, Just LED one in On and led2(mid) and led3(high) dose not turn on , please give me a code to read this","completion":"From your description, it seems like the potentiometer values correspond to specific resistance readings (65 ohms minimum and 330 ohms maximum). Let's write a code snippet that reads the analog value from the potentiometer, converts it to a resistance value, and then lights up an LED based on the resistance range. First of all, please verify how the potentiometer is connected to your circuit. The connections should be like this: - One of the outer pins of the potentiometer to 5V. - The opposite outer pin of the potentiometer to GND. - The center pin (wiper) of the potentiometer to the analog pin A5. Now we will adjust the code to use resistance ranges based on the information you provided: \`\`\`cpp const int potPin = A5; // Analog pin connected to the potentiometer const int ledLowPin = 2; // LED indicating low value const int ledMidPin = 3; // LED indicating mid value const int ledHighPin = 4; // LED indicating high value void setup() { pinMode(ledLowPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledMidPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledHighPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(potPin, INPUT); Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication (for debugging) } void loop() { int potValue = analogRead(potPin); // Read the potentiometer value // Calculate the resistance using the maximum and minimum values // Map the potentiometer value which ranges from 0 to 1023 to the resistance range int resistance = map(potValue, 0, 1023, 65, 330); Serial.print(\\"Potentiometer Value: \\"); Serial.println(potValue); Serial.print(\\"Mapped Resistance: \\"); Serial.println(resistance); // Clear all LEDs before setting the new state digitalWrite(ledLowPin, LOW); digitalWrite(ledMidPin, LOW); digitalWrite(ledHighPin, LOW); // Considering a three-part division of the range 65-330, we divide the range into three equal parts int rangeSize = (330 - 65) / 3; int lowThreshold = 65 + rangeSize; // One-third of the way int highThreshold = 65 + rangeSize*2; // Two-thirds of the way // Turn on the appropriate LED based on the resistance if(resistance < lowThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledLowPin, HIGH); } else if(resistance >= lowThreshold && resistance < highThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledMidPin, HIGH); } else if(resistance >= highThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledHighPin, HIGH); } delay(100); // Small delay to reduce noise and rapid LED changes } \`\`\` With this code, the LEDs should light up based on the resistance range calculated from the potentiometer's value. Please ensure that the calculated resistances make sense for your potentiometer. If necessary, use the \`Serial.println()\` debugging outputs to check the values you're getting and adjust the thresholds according to your specific range and desired separation points. Remember that \`map()\` does not guarantee precise mapping due to integer math, so if you need more precision, you may need to work with floating-point math and calibrate the thresholds manually using the serial output for tuning."},{"prompt":"please know I just want to read the value of potentiometer and I didn't put 5V to my potentiometer , I used middle pin and GND (middle pin is connected to A0 and GND is connected to GND of arduino uno)","completion":"If you're only using the middle pin (wiper) and a GND connection for the potentiometer, it sounds like you might be trying to read the resistance directly, which typically isn't how a potentiometer is connected for use with an Arduino. Typically, you create a voltage divider by connecting one of the outer pins to 5V, the other outer pin to GND, and the middle pin to the analog input. This allows the Arduino to read the changing voltage as the potentiometer is adjusted. A direct resistance reading isn't standard with Arduino since the analog inputs are designed to measure voltage, not resistance. However, in your case, since you are looking to measure resistance variations and you only have the middle pin connected, you can form a partial voltage divider by connecting a known resistor to 5V and the wiper (middle pin) and then measuring the voltage across the known resistor. Here's how to connect it: - Connect a known resistor (for example, a 10kΩ resistor) from 5V to A0. - Connect the wiper (middle pin) of the potentiometer to A0 too. - Connect one of the outer pins of the potentiometer to GND. This creates a voltage divider, and the voltage at A0 will vary as you turn the potentiometer. Here's the revised code to reflect the change: \`\`\`cpp const int potPin = A0; // Analog pin connected to the potentiometer const int knownResistorValue = 10000; // Resistance in ohms (10kΩ for example) const int ledLowPin = 2; // LED indicating low value const int ledMidPin = 3; // LED indicating mid value const int ledHighPin = 4; // LED indicating high value void setup() { pinMode(ledLowPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledMidPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledHighPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(potPin, INPUT); Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication (for debugging) } void loop() { int sensorValue = analogRead(potPin); // Read the analog value from the voltage divider float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); // Convert the value to voltage float resistance = (5.0 - voltage) * knownResistorValue / voltage; // Calculate the resistance of the potentiometer Serial.print(\\"Sensor Value: \\"); Serial.println(sensorValue); Serial.print(\\"Voltage: \\"); Serial.println(voltage); Serial.print(\\"Resistance: \\"); Serial.println(resistance); // Clear all LEDs before setting the new state digitalWrite(ledLowPin, LOW); digitalWrite(ledMidPin, LOW); digitalWrite(ledHighPin, LOW); // Define breakpoints for 'low', 'mid', and 'high' as per the potentiometer's resistance range int lowThreshold = 100; // Example threshold, adjust as needed int highThreshold = 200; // Example threshold, adjust as needed // Turn on the appropriate LED based on the resistance if(resistance < lowThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledLowPin, HIGH); } else if (resistance >= lowThreshold && resistance < highThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledMidPin, HIGH); } else if (resistance >= highThreshold) { digitalWrite(ledHighPin, HIGH); } delay(100); // Small delay to reduce noise and rapid LED changes } \`\`\` Remember, the \`lowThreshold\` and \`highThreshold\` values are placeholders and should be replaced with resistance breakpoints that you establish based on observations from the Serial Monitor. This calculation method assumes the voltage across the known resistor is linearly related to the potentiometer's wiper position, which may not be entirely accurate due to the tolerance of both resistors and the linearity of the potentiometer. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the real-world behavior of your circuit when setting the thresholds. You may need to use the readings from the Serial Monitor to manually determine the best resistance thresholds for your LEDs."},{"prompt":"nên kinh doanh gì để xây dựng ý tưởng kinh doanh gắn liền với sự phát triển bền vững và bảo vệ môi trường?","completion":"Khi lựa chọn ý tưởng kinh doanh gắn liền với sự phát triển bền vững và bảo vệ môi trường, bạn có thể cân nhắc những lĩnh vực sau: 1.

This might be happening because the YOLOv5 repository cannot be successfully cloned from GitHub, or because there's another issue with the setup of Torch Hub. To resolve this issue, follow these steps: 1. Make sure you have an internet connection and access to GitHub, as \`torch.hub.load\` will attempt to download the YOLOv5 repository. 2. Ensure \`git\` is installed on your system and that it's accessible from your command line or terminal. \`torch.hub.load\` uses \`git\` to clone repositories. 3. You might also want to clear the cache of Torch Hub to remove any potentially corrupted files that have been downloaded. You can do this by removing the contents of \`C:UsersNinja.000/.cachetorchhub\`. 4. Alternatively, you can manually clone the YOLOv5 repository into your working directory using git and then point your YOLOv5 loading mechanism to the locally cloned repository. Here's how you could do it: \`\`\`sh git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git \`\`\` Then, in your Python code, modify the \`load_yolov5\` method to load the model from a local directory: \`\`\`python def load_yolov5(self, local_dir_path, weights_file_path): # Load the model from a local directory instead of using torch.hub model = torch.hub.load(local_dir_path, 'custom', path=weights_file_path, source='local') return model \`\`\` Make sure to pass a correct \`local_dir_path\` when you call this function. 5. In your given code, you seem to try to load a custom-trained YOLOv5 model. Double-check that \`weights_file_path\` points to the correct location of your \`.pt\` file. 6. If you continue to face issues with Torch Hub, you can directly load the YOLOv5 model from your local file system without using Torch Hub altogether, but this would require you to handle the model architecture manually. Lastly, make sure you're running your code with appropriate permissions and that nothing is blocking your script's access to the required directories and files. If your Python environment is installed in a system-wide directory (like Program Files), you might want to consider using a virtual environment to avoid permission issues."},{"prompt":"import numpy as np import cv2 import os from time import sleep from PIL import Image import torch # Set your game window name window_name = \\"Superfighters Deluxe v1.3.7d\\" # Provide the full path to your custom weights file weights_file_path = r\\"C:UsersNinja.000Downloadsexp3-20240102T094124Z-001exp3weightsbest.pt\\" local_dir_path = r\\"C:UsersNinja.000Downloadsyolov5-masteryolov5-master\\" class WindowCapture: def __init__(self, window_name): self.window_name = window_name self.capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0) def get_screenshot(self): ret, frame = self.capture.read() if not ret: raise Exception('Failed to capture frame from camera.') return frame def generate_image_dataset(self): if not os.path.exists(\\"images\\"): os.mkdir(\\"images\\") while True: img = self.get_screenshot() im = Image.fromarray(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)) im.save(f\\"./images/img_{len(os.listdir('images'))}.jpeg\\") sleep(1) def get_window_size(self): w = int(self.capture.get(3)) h = int(self.capture.get(4)) return w, h class ImageProcessor: def __init__(self, img_size, local_dir_path, weights_file_path): self.model = self.load_yolov5(local_dir_path, weights_file_path) self.model.to('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') self.model.eval() self.W, self.H = img_size def load_yolov5(self, local_dir_path, weights_file_path): # Load the model from a local directory instead of using torch.hub model = torch.hub.load(local_dir_path, 'custom', path=weights_file_path, source='local') return model def process_image(self, img): results = self.model(img) pred = results.xyxy[0].cpu().numpy() # Convert coordinates to match the original image size pred[:, [0, 2]] *= self.W pred[:, [1, 3]] *= self.H return pred def draw_identified_objects(self, img, coordinates): for coordinate in coordinates: x, y, w, h, conf, cls = coordinate color = (0, 255, 0) # Green color for bounding box cv2.rectangle(img, (int(x), int(y)), (int(w), int(h)), color, 2) cv2.putText(img, f'Class: {int(cls)}, Conf: {conf:.2f}', (int(x), int(y) - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, color, 2) cv2.imshow('window', img) wincap = WindowCapture(window_name) improc = ImageProcessor(wincap.get_window_size(), local_dir_path, weights_file_path) while True: ss = wincap.get_screenshot() if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'): cv2.destroyAllWindows() break # Preprocess image for YOLOv5 img = wincap.get_screenshot() img = cv2.resize(img, (640, 480)) img = img.transpose(2, 0, 1) # Channels first (C, H, W) img = np.expand_dims(img, 0) # Add batch dimension # Convert to torch tensor img = torch.from_numpy(img).float().div(255.0) # Inference and post-process coordinates = improc.process_image(img) # Draw bounding boxes on the image improc.draw_identified_objects(ss, coordinates) for coordinate in coordinates: print(coordinate) print() sleep(0.2) print('Finished.')

Felicidade: - É um estado mais duradouro e profundo de contentamento e satisfação com a vida. - Não depende necessariamente de um evento ou circunstância específica, podendo ser uma sensação cultivada ao longo do tempo. - Pode ter uma perspectiva mais global, envolvendo uma avaliação geral da vida e das circunstâncias pessoais. - Muitas vezes é associada a uma sensação de paz interior, propósito ou realização. - A busca pela felicidade pode ser considerada como uma parte intrínseca à condição humana e um objetivo de vida para muitas pessoas. Alegria: - Refere-se a um sentimento geralmente mais intenso e efêmero de prazer, excitação ou entusiasmo. - Está frequentemente ligada a uma causa ou evento específico, como receber boas notícias, estar na companhia de amigos ou participar de um evento agradável. - A alegria é expressa frequentemente de forma extrovertida, muitas vezes através do riso, sorrisos ou outras demonstrações de contentamento. - Como uma emoção, a alegria pode ser mais imediata e reativa em comparação à felicidade mais estável e constante. Em resumo, a alegria é uma emoção momentânea normalmente provocada por um acontecimento específico, enquanto a felicidade é um estado mais abrangente, que exprime uma satisfação geral com a vida. No entanto, ambas são interconectadas, e a presença de momentos alegres frequentes pode contribuir para um sentimento geral de felicidade."},{"prompt":"Seja mais simples","completion":"Claro!

Este episódio faz parte da quarta e última temporada do anime e expõe ainda mais a complexa mecânica de viagem no tempo e de influência entre os portadores da habilidade de Titãs. A manipulação ocorre por meio do poder do Titã de Ataque, que Eren possuía. O Titã de Ataque tem a habilidade única de enviar memórias para o passado e para o futuro. Isso permite que o portador do Titã de Ataque influencie seus predecessores e até mesmo veja memórias de futuros portadores. Eren usou esse poder para influenciar Grisha no passado. Ele mostrou a Grisha memórias específicas que o convenceram a agir de maneira a favorecer os planos de Eren no futuro. Isso incluiu a crucial tarefa de Grisha em obter o poder do Titã Fundador ao devorar a família real Reiss, exceto Rod Reiss que escapou. Eren mostrou a Grisha as memórias de eventos que ainda não haviam ocorrido em seu próprio tempo, principalmente eventos relacionados ao próprio Eren e as consequências de suas ações no futuro. Eren manipula seu pai ao mostrar as atrocidades que a humanidade enfrentaria se eles não lutassem contra os opressores de Paradis. Isso convence Grisha de que é necessário sacrificar a família Reiss para que Eren e a humanidade dentro das muralhas possam ter uma chance de sobrevivência e liberdade. O episódio revela um complicado entrelaçamento das linhas do tempo e a relação pai-filho, juntamente com as severas implicações morais e éticas das ações tomadas por os dois personagens. Isso também explica vários desenvolvimentos da trama que foram semeados em temporadas anteriores do anime. A habilidade de Eren de manipular os eventos por meio do poder do Titã de Ataque é um aspecto fundamental para entender a narrativa complexa de Shingeki no Kyojin e as ações do próprio Eren nos eventos finais da série."},{"prompt":"Frases Ditas Por John Wick","completion":"John Wick, um personagem icônico retratado por Keanu Reeves na série de filmes de mesmo nome, é conhecido por sua natureza reservada e suas ações falarem mais alto do que suas palavras.

What would be your rationale and next steps in both diagnosis and management?"},{"prompt":"Describe the pain","completion":"The pain as described by the patient is: - Severe in intensity - Sudden onset, started 6 hours ago - Located in the upper abdomen (epigastric region) - Radiates to the back - Constant, and has progressively worsened over time - Not relieved by antacids or changing position While both acute pancreatitis and peptic ulcer disease can present with severe abdominal pain, the nature of the pain, associated symptoms, and clinical findings can help differentiate between the two conditions. Here's how the pain characteristics might guide your diagnosis: **Acute Pancreatitis:** The pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically intense and can start suddenly. It often radiates to the back and may be persistent. It is usually aggravated by eating, especially fatty foods. The fact that the pain is not relieved with a position change or antacids also leans more towards acute pancreatitis. **Peptic Ulcer:** Peptic ulcer pain is generally located in the epigastric area as well, but it is often described as a burning or gnawing pain. It might improve with antacids or eating food, and typically doesn't radiate to the back. It can be more intermittent and may have periods of remission and exacerbation. Based on the provided case scenario with marked tenderness in the epigastric region, elevated serum amylase and lipase, and systemic signs of inflammation (fever, slightly elevated white cell count), acute pancreatitis seems more likely than peptic ulcer disease. However, further investigations such as abdominal imaging (e.g., abdominal ultrasound or CT scan) would be important for confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other potential causes such as gallstones, which are a common etiology for acute pancreatitis. Management would typically involve NPO (nothing by mouth), IV fluid resuscitation, pain management, and addressing any underlying etiological factors. Additionally, close monitoring of the patient’s clinical status and laboratory parameters would be essential, given the risk for complications associated with acute pancreatitis."},{"prompt":"Give me another case","completion":"Certainly, here's another clinical scenario for you to evaluate: **Patient Information:** - Age: 32 years old - Sex: Female - Past medical history: Healthy, with no significant medical history. - Medication: Occasional ibuprofen for headaches. **Presenting Complaint:** The patient arrives at your office complaining of epigastric pain that has been recurrent over the past two months but has intensified in the past week. She describes the pain as \\"burning\\" and notices it gets worse on an empty stomach and often wakes her up at night. **Associated Symptoms:** - Occasional nausea, no vomiting. - Reported recent unintentional weight loss of 5 kg within the last two months. - No changes in bowel habits. - Denies fever or chills. **Physical Examination:** - Vital Signs: BP 120/75 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), RR 16 breaths/min. - Abdominal examination: Mild to moderate tenderness upon palpation in the epigastric region. No rebound tenderness or guarding. - Bowel sounds are normal. **Laboratory Results:** - Normal serum amylase and lipase. - Normal liver function tests. - Hemoglobin on the lower end of the normal range. - Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) is positive. Given this new case, would you suspect peptic ulcer disease or another condition? What would be your rationale, differential diagnoses, and next steps in both diagnosis and management?"},{"prompt":"It's a peptic ulcer more likely to be duodenal upcer","completion":"Given the provided case details, peptic ulcer disease, more specifically a duodenal ulcer, is a strong possibility. Your conclusion is supported by several aspects of the patient's presentation: - Epigastric burning pain that is worse on an empty stomach and at night: This type of pain is characteristic of duodenal ulcers, as nocturnal pain and pain between meals are common symptoms. Eating food can often provide temporary relief as it neutralizes stomach acid. - Unintentional weight loss: While there can be many causes, in the context of gastrointestinal symptoms, this could be due to eating less to avoid pain. - FOBT positive: Indicates the presence of blood in the stool, which can be a sign of bleeding associated with peptic ulcers. The mild anemia hinted at by the hemoglobin on the lower end of the normal range is also consistent with chronic blood loss that could be secondary to a bleeding ulcer. To further evaluate and manage this suspected duodenal ulcer, the following steps might be taken: - **Endoscopy (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD):** This would allow direct visualization of the ulcer, confirmation of the diagnosis, and assessment for possible H. pylori infection, which is a common cause of duodenal ulcers. - **Helicobacter pylori Testing:** This can be done via a urea breath test, stool antigen test, or biopsy during EGD. If H. pylori is present, eradication therapy should be initiated. - **Management of NSAID use:** Since NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, are a risk factor for peptic ulcers, discussing the risks and benefits of continued NSAID use with the patient is crucial. Alternative pain management strategies should be considered if appropriate. - **Medical Therapy:** If an ulcer is found, treatment may include a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce gastric acid secretion and protect the lining of the stomach and duodenum, promoting healing. - **Lifestyle Modifications:** Advise on smoking cessation, avoidance of NSAIDs (if implicated), and moderation of alcohol intake if relevant. - **Follow-up and Monitoring:** Arrange for follow-up to ensure the resolution of symptoms, healing of the ulcer, and reevaluation if symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment. By adhering to this systematic approach, you can effectively address the patient's symptoms, treat the underlying condition, prevent complications, and promote long-term gastrointestinal health."},{"prompt":"does this code pocess n+1 probleam require 'time' class Api::V1::SchedulesController < ApplicationController def index # convert the dep and des station names to uppercase and replace underscores with spaces departure_station = params[:departure]&.upcase destination_station = params[:destination]&.upcase time = params[:time].present? ?

The N+1 problem occurs when an application makes one query to retrieve the primary records (e.g., Schedules) and then iterates over each record to make further queries (e.g., for associated Stations). Here are the specific signs in the code snippet: \`\`\`ruby schedules = Schedule.joins(:stations) .where(...) .group('schedules.id') .having('COUNT(DISTINCT stations.name) = 2') .distinct trips = schedules.map do |schedule| stations = schedule.stations.order(:id) # This line might cause separate queries for each schedule ... end \`\`\` The critical line is: \`\`\`ruby stations = schedule.stations.order(:id) \`\`\` This instance method call on each \`schedule\` is suggestive of a separate query being issued to retrieve \`stations\` for every \`schedule\`. When iterating over a collection of \`schedules\`, each iteration may trigger an individual database query to fetch the related \`stations\`, resulting in N additional queries where N is the number of schedules. To prevent the N+1 query problem, you would typically include the associated records in the initial query using \`includes\`: \`\`\`ruby schedules = Schedule.includes(:stations) .joins(:stations) .where(...) .group('schedules.id') .having('COUNT(DISTINCT stations.name) = 2') .distinct \`\`\` The \`includes\` method allows Rails to load the associated \`stations\` records in the same or separate query(s) (eager loading) depending on the database adapter and conditions, but it generally helps in reducing the total number of queries. Moreover, the code performs secondary operations on the \`stations\` association as well, such as filtering and sorting, which can also contribute to potential inefficiency. Keep in mind, however, that merely addressing this N+1 issue might not completely optimize the method due to other possible inefficiencies in the way the ActiveRecord relations and Ruby array manipulations are used together. It's important to analyze the complete query logic, possibly using a query performance tool or ActiveRecord logs, to understand the specific details and ensure the most optimal way to achieve the desired result."},{"prompt":"Bonjour Mickaël et Cristina Nous vous souhaitons une très bonne année.

Кнопке может потребоваться Text Block для отображения текущей клавиши. 2. **Создание логики переназначения клавиш**: - В Blueprint виджета добавьте функцию, которая вызывается при нажатии кнопки для начала переназначения. Эта функция должна захватить следующий ввод клавиши от пользователя и привязать его к действию. - Используйте \\"Wait for Input\\" ноду или аналогичную логику для обработки входного события от пользователя (ожидание новой клавиши). 3. **Проверка на наличие конфликтующих назначений**: - До того, как назначить новую клавишу на действие, вам нужно убедиться, что она не используется для других действий. Для этого пройдитесь по всем назначенным клавишам и проверьте, не назначена ли уже клавиша. - Это можно сделать, получая все текущие назначения клавиш через \\"Get Input Key Mappings\\" ноду и сравнивая их с ключом, который пытается установить пользователь. 4. **Создание виджета конфликта**: - Создайте другой виджет Blueprint (назовите его например \\"KeyConflictWidget\\"), который будет отображаться, когда найден конфликт клавиш. - Добавьте в этот виджет текстовое сообщение о том, что клавиша уже назначена и кнопки для решения конфликта (например, \\"Переназначить\\" и \\"Отмена\\"). 5. **Отображение предупреждения о конфликте**: - Когда обнаруживается конфликт, создайте и отобразите \\"KeyConflictWidget\\" на экране. - Управляйте потоком на основе выбора пользователя – если пользователь хочет переназначить клавишу, освободите предыдущее действие от этой клавиши и назначьте ее заново. 6. **Сохранение новых назначений клавиш**: - Когда пользователь подтвердил свой выбор и нет конфликтов, сохраните новые назначения клавиш, используя \\"Save Key Mappings\\" ноду или сохраните изменения в файл конфигурации. Обратите внимание, что пошаговый процесс вмешивается во многие аспекты Blueprint и пользовательского интерфейса, и требует подробного понимания системы ввода UE5 и управления виджетами. Конкретные детали реализации могут варьироваться в зависимости от структуры ваших инпут систем и интерфейса. Готовых универсальных решений может не существовать, и вам, возможно, придется адаптировать данные инструкции под свои нужды."},{"prompt":"3. Проверка на наличие конфликтующих назначений: давай этот шаг поподробней","completion":"Давайте рассмотрим подробнее шаг 3: проверку на наличие конфликтующих назначений клавиш. В Unreal Engine есть система Input, которая позволяет узнать текущие настройки управления. Используя эту систему, вы можете проверить, связана ли нажатая пользователем клавиша с другим действием или осью. Вот как можно создать проверку на конфликты в Blueprint: 1. Получите список всех назначенных клавиш: В Blueprint, где происходит обработка назначения клавиш, используйте ноду \\"Get Input Key Mappings\\". Эта нода возвращает массив структур FInputKeyBinding, который содержит информацию о всех назначенных действиях и клавишах. 2. Переберите все назначения: Используйте ноду \\"For Each Loop\\" для перебора всех элементов массива, который вы получили из \\"Get Input Key Mappings\\". 3. Сравните назначенные клавиши: Для каждого элемента массива нужно сравнить привязанную клавишу (а для осей - клавишу и направление оси (положительное/отрицательное значение)) с той клавишей, на которую хочет переназначить пользователь. 4. Проверка назначенного действия: Убедитесь, что проверяемое назначение не соответствует тому действию, которое вы сейчас хотите переназначить (в этом случае конфликта нет, даже если клавиша та же). 5. Если клавиша занята: Если вы обнаруживаете, что клавиша уже занята, нужно выполнить действие, например показать \\"KeyConflictWidget\\", как описано ранее, и предложить пользователю решение конфликта. Вот пример псевдокода в Blueprint, который иллюстрирует, как может быть реализована проверка: \`\`\` Event RebindKeyClicked() // Событие происходит, когда пользователь хочет переназначить клавишу FInputKey NewKey // Это клавиша, выбранная пользователем bool bKeyConflict = false // Флаг, в котором мы отмечаем, есть ли конфликт // Получаем все назначения клавиш FInputKeyBinding[] AllKeyBindings = GetInputKeyMappings() // Перебираем все назначения ForEach AllKeyBindings as CurrentBinding // Проверяем, не совпадает ли клавиша и не связано ли это с тем же действием, что и мы переназначаем if CurrentBinding.Key == NewKey && CurrentBinding.ActionName != ActionWeAreRebinding bKeyConflict = true break // Если нашли конфликт, выходим из цикла if bKeyConflict // Отображаем виждет с предупреждением о конфликте ShowKeyConflictWidget() else // Назначаем клавишу на действие AssignKeyToAction(ActionWeAreRebinding, NewKey) \`\`\` Теперь, когда конфликт обнаружен, можно предложить пользователю либо отметить свой выбор и выбрать другую клавишу, либо переназначить текущее действие текущего конфликта на другую клавишу, освободив тем самым новую клавишу для действия, которое пользователь пытается обновить."},{"prompt":"متن زیر را به فارسی ترجمه کن. با بالاترین کیفیت Some Questions to Use in Analyzing Novels Questions relating to the analysis of PLOT 1.

Here are a few suggestions that could help improve the script: 1. Before performing actions on resources that could be disruptive, it's a good practice to check whether the VM is running and to handle the situation accordingly, either by waiting for the VM to be in a stopped state or by warning the user. 2. When creating the snapshot and disk configuration, you don't necessarily need to create a new disk name with a timestamp unless you have a specific requirement to track when the disk was created. However, if that is the case, then your approach is fine. 3. After removing a data disk from a VM (\`Remove-AzVMDataDisk\`), the \`vm\` object is not automatically updated. You should refresh it by calling \`Get-AzVM\` again before you try to add the new disk. This will ensure you're working with the latest state. 4. You might want to consider adding a progress indicator to inform the user about the status, as operations like creating snapshots and disks can take some time. 5. Error handling could be expanded to provide more detailed information about the specific point of failure in your try/catch blocks. 6.

This could be a proper way to integrate attention into a Keras model, assuming the attention mechanism is correctly implemented and applied. However, there are key points to consider: 1. The Attention() class you've defined involves a weight matrix \`W\` and a bias \`b\`. The computation \`q\` is potentially correct, as you seem to attempt a form of additive attention where each input vector is transformed by the weight matrix \`W\` and then a bias is added. 2. You apply a \`tanh\` non-linearity to \`q\`, which is common in additive attention mechanisms. A softmax is then applied to generate the attention weights \`a\`. 3. Attention weights \`a\` are then used to scale the inputs. This implies that you're using a form of element-wise product to apply the attention weights, which is indeed a form of attention. 4. Your attention mechanism returns the scaled inputs directly, which doesn't take into account the context vector typically computed in attention mechanisms. Usually, you do a weighted sum of the inputs based on attention scores to form a context vector that is combined with the current LSTM output. 5. The \`compute_output_shape\` might not consider changes in the output shape when a weighted sum or pooling of the context vectors is applied. If you are not observing any difference in performance with the attention mechanism, it may be due to several reasons: 1. The attention mechanism might not be well-suited to your particular time series data or problem. 2. There might be an implementation error within the attention mechanism, causing it not to function as intended. 3. The rest of the network (CNN layers, LSTM layers, activation functions, etc.) could be dominating the predictive capability, and the attention mechanism may not be contributing additional useful information. To verify the implementation, you can simplify the testing by using a smaller dataset or a toy problem where you know that attention should make a significant difference. By isolating the layer and testing it independently, you can get a better sense of whether it's behaving as expected. Additionally, consider using attention mechanisms that have been proven effective in existing research and frameworks, such as those available in Keras or TensorFlow. Keep in mind that simply adding an attention mechanism doesn't guarantee better performance—it must be the right fit for the problem, and it must be implemented and integrated correctly into the model. Lastly, make sure that the rest of your model is properly configured and trained. Hyperparameter tuning, feature preprocessing, and choosing the right architecture can have profound impacts on model performance, often more so than introducing additional complexity into the network with mechanisms like attention."},{"prompt":"is it different to apply attention mechanism to bidirectional lstm instead of vanilla lstms?","completion":"Applying an attention mechanism to a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is conceptually similar to applying it to a vanilla LSTM. However, the BiLSTM provides additional context compared to the vanilla LSTM because it processes the input sequence in both directions. This means that at any given time step, a BiLSTM has access to past and future information within the sequence, which can be advantageous for certain sequence modeling tasks. Here are some key points related to applying attention to BiLSTM: 1. **Bidirectional Context**: When using an attention mechanism with a BiLSTM, you have to deal with the concatenated outputs from the forward and backward passes of the LSTM. For a given time step, the output of a BiLSTM is typically twice the size of that produced by a standard LSTM because it concatenates the hidden states of the forward and backward LSTMs. 2. **Attention Implementation**: The attention weights are computed based on the concatenated hidden states. If your attention mechanism is implemented correctly, it should be able to handle the larger size of the hidden states and produce the correct attention-weighted context vector. 3. **Increased Complexity**: A BiLSTM with attention has more parameters and states to learn from because it gathers information from two directions. This can make the model more complex and potentially harder to train, but can also enable it to capture richer representations of the data. 4. **Computation of the Context Vector**: For BiLSTMs, the context vector calculation will often look at both past and future information. This is done by summing up the product of attention weights and the concatenated hidden states across all time steps to form the context vector. 5. **Integration into Model**: When integrating attention with a BiLSTM, make sure the shapes of tensors are correctly handled, especially since the concatenated outputs of the BiLSTM will be different from that of a regular LSTM. Here's a schematic of how attention might work with a BiLSTM: - Inputs are processed by the BiLSTM layer to produce forward and backward hidden states for each time step. - The forward and backward hidden states are concatenated. - The attention mechanism uses these concatenated states to compute attention scores. - Attention scores are applied to the hidden states to produce an attention-weighted context vector. In conclusion, the functional difference lies in the way the data is processed by the BiLSTM and how the attention mechanism interacts with this bidirectional data. While the integration of the attention mechanism can be similar, the attention mechanism must be designed to handle the intricacies of the bidirectional processing, making sure it uses the correct dimensions and achieves the desired effect of focusing on the most relevant parts of the input sequence."},{"prompt":"upon researching. why is my model not in this way? lstm_out = Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True))(inputs) attention_out = Attention(32)(lstm_out) outputs = Dense(1)(attention_out) model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs) model.compile(optimizer=\\"adam\\", loss=\\"mean_squared_error\\")","completion":"The code snippet you provided is a simplified version of how to integrate an attention mechanism with a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The structure of your model may differ from this for several reasons, including design choices or the complexity of your specific problem. Let's break down the snippet to understand what it does: \`\`\`python lstm_out = Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True))(inputs) attention_out = Attention(32)(lstm_out) outputs = Dense(1)(attention_out) \`\`\` 1. **\`Bidirectional(LSTM(...))\`**: This layer wraps the LSTM layer to make it bidirectional, meaning it processes the sequence both forwards and backwards and concatenates the outputs from both directions. 2. **\`Attention(...)\`**: The \`Attention(32)\` suggests a Keras-compatible attention layer is being used, presumably with 32 units for the internal calculations in the attention layer. Note that this is not a built-in Keras layer, so it would need to be custom-defined or part of some third-party library. 3. **\`Dense(1)\`**: The final layer is a dense layer with a single output unit, which is typical for regression problems where you want to predict a single continuous value. 4. **\`Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)\`**: This constructs a functional API model by specifying the input and output tensors. Now, looking at your initial code, it appears you're using a Sequential model with the attention mechanism incorporated within it, along with some Conv1D layers, dropout, and flattening before the BiLSTM layer. The main differences seem to be due to the complexity of your model and the custom implementation of your attention layer. Your model also uses additional layers and the Elu activation inside the LSTM unit, among other customizations. These choices might be based on your understanding of the problem, experimentations, or domain-specific knowledge that suggested more complicated architecture would perform better. The simplified model provided in your recent message does not have these Conv1D layers or dropout, and potentially assumes a different kind of attention mechanism that is not custom-defined but one that would also handle sequences with \`return_sequences=True\`. Your custom attention layer and how it is called suggest it operates on a per-timestep basis, which might be different from what the \`Attention(32)\` layer represents. Lastly, the choice of using the functional API (\`Model\`) versus the sequential model (\`Sequential\`) is a design choice based on your needs for flexibility and model complexity. The functional API is more flexible and allows for more complex models that may have multiple input or output paths, shared layers, etc., while the Sequential API is linear and simpler to use but limited to layer stacks that process data sequentially. Given these potential differences, if your model is not performing as expected with the attention mechanism, you might want to try various things including: 1. Ensuring that your custom attention mechanism is implemented correctly. 2. Experimenting with using existing attention mechanisms from libraries like TensorFlow Addons, which offer tested and confirmed-to-work attention layers. 3. Adjusting and simplifying other parts of your model (such as removing Conv1D layers) to better understand how the attention mechanism is affecting performance."},{"prompt":"ok i got an error in burai visualiser for QE .

The \`-n\` option should be followed by the number of processors you wish to use, before the actual executable name (\`pw.exe\` in your case). Your current command has the order incorrect. If you want to run the job using 12 processors, your command should look something like this: \`\`\`bash mpiexec.exe -n 12 pw.exe -in espresso.in \`\`\` In this corrected command, \`-n 12\` indicates that \`mpiexec.exe\` will run 12 parallel processes of \`pw.exe\`, and \`-in espresso.in\` tells \`pw.exe\` to use \`espresso.in\` as the input file. Also, regarding threads, Quantum ESPRESSO typically relies on MPI for parallelization over processors and OpenMP for multithreading within each processor. If you want to use 24 threads across 12 processors, you might need to set an environment variable for OpenMP threads, typically \`OMP_NUM_THREADS\`. However, for this, you need to ensure Quantum ESPRESSO is compiled with OpenMP support. If you want to run on 12 processors and 24 threads (assuming 2 threads per processor with OpenMP), your command might look like this: \`\`\`bash export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 mpiexec.exe -n 12 pw.exe -in espresso.in \`\`\` But be aware that assigning multiple threads per MPI process might not always lead to better performance due to potential resource contention unless the workload and hardware are optimized for such a configuration.

Running Quantum ESPRESSO with parallel processing should indeed reduce computational time, especially for larger and more complex calculations. Just a few things to keep in mind as your job is running: 1. **Monitoring the Job**: You can monitor the progress of your calculation by checking the output file or any standard output that \`pw.exe\` produces. This will give you insight into the progression of the simulation steps. 2. **Performance Expectations**: While using more processors generally speeds up calculations, the scaling is not always linear. The actual performance gain can depend on several factors, including the type of calculation, the system size, interprocessor communication overhead, and the efficiency of the parallelization in the Quantum ESPRESSO code for your particular case. 3. **Hardware Utilization**: Make sure your system's resources are enough to handle the number of processors and threads you've allocated. It's crucial to balance the computational load and not to over-subscribe the physical cores, or you might face diminishing returns or even performance degradation. 4. **Analysis of Results**: Once the job has finished, you will need to analyze the output to determine the success of the calculation and the quality of the results. Quantum ESPRESSO generates a lot of data, and it’s important to know what to look for to interpret the results correctly. 5. **Iterative Improvement**: If you find that your job did not perform as quickly as anticipated, or if you experience any errors, consider adjusting the number of processors or threads. Finding the optimal configuration may take a few trials, especially when accounting for the specifics of your hardware and the complexity of your simulation.

Some calculations (e.g. meta-GGA functionals, Gamma-only phonon, third-order energy derivatives: Raman, anharmonic force constants) work only with NC PPs; CP does not yet support PAW. An excellent resource for PPs is Standard Solid State PPs (SSSP), a collection of the best verified PPs, maintained by THEOS and MARVEL on the Materials Cloud. Ready-to-use PP tables are available here. Some of these tables are kept for reference and are not recommended. If you do not find the PP you need, you may still get a suitable one from other resources. Quantum ESPRESSO uses a unified PP format (UPF) for all types of PPs and still accepts a number of older formats. The directory upflib/ of the QE distribution contains utilities that convert to UPF format several PP formats used by other electronic-structure codes. Remember: always test the PPs on simple test systems before proceeding to serious calculations if you use PPs generated by others, please give full credit to the authors (see this page for a rather complete list of acknowledgments) I'm using the Ready-to-use PP tables... hmmm","completion":"It's essential to choose the right set of pseudopotentials (PPs) for your Quantum ESPRESSO simulations, as they play a crucial role in the accuracy and efficiency of your calculations. Here are some steps and considerations to help you select and work with better pseudopotentials: 1. **Pseudopotential Types**: Understand the different types of pseudopotentials available: - **Norm-Conserving (NC)** PPs are generally more transferable and reliable for a wide range of conditions but tend to require higher plane-wave cutoffs, leading to more computationally intensive calculations. - **Ultrasoft (US)** PPs allow for lower plane-wave cutoffs, reducing computational demands, but might be less transferable. - **PAW** PPs can offer accuracy close to all-electron calculations and are suitable for difficult cases (e.g., transition metals), but they can be computationally more demanding. 2. **SSSP Library**: The Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials (SSSP) library is an excellent resource for high-quality pseudopotentials, and it's maintained by the THEOS group and MARVEL project on the Materials Cloud platform. SSSP pseudopotentials are tested for convergence, accuracy, and efficiency, making them a good starting point: - Choose a set from the SSSP library that's recommended for your type of calculation. - Consider the \\"efficiency\\" vs. \\"precision\\" trade-off that is typically indicated for the PPs in the SSSP. 3. **Compatibility**: Make sure the PP is compatible with the type of calculation you want to perform. For example, some functionalities in Quantum ESPRESSO only work with certain types of PPs (e.g., meta-GGA functionals might require NC PPs). 4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test any new PP on simple systems before using them for complex simulations. Testing helps verify their transferability and suitability for your calculations. 5. **Conversion and Format**: Quantum ESPRESSO uses the Unified Pseudopotential Format (UPF). Ensure your chosen PPs are in this format or convert them using utilities provided in the \`upflib\` directory of the QE distribution. 6. **Attribution**: If you use pseudopotentials generated by others, follow proper academic protocol by acknowledging the authors as suggested on the relevant resources or materials cloud pages. 7. **Versioning and Updates**: Pseudopotential libraries are periodically updated. Use the latest recommended versions and check for any updates or errata related to the PPs you have selected. To switch your current pseudopotentials to ones from the SSSP library or any other source, you would replace the PP files in your Quantum ESPRESSO input with the new ones, ensuring they comply with the required accuracy and compatibility for your simulations, and then follow the standard procedure to run your calculations with the newly selected PPs."},{"prompt":"transferability you mean to transfer to QE or some other meaning ?","completion":"In the context of pseudopotentials, \\"transferability\\" refers to the concept of how well a pseudopotential can be used to accurately represent the electronic structure and properties of an element in different chemical environments. It does not relate to the transfer or compatibility of files between different software packages. A highly transferable pseudopotential can be used across a wide range of conditions, such as: - Different coordinations (e.g., from bulk to surface, to molecules) - Various bonding situations (e.g., covalent, ionic, metallic) - A range of pressures and structural phases The better the transferability of a pseudopotential, the more reliable and accurate the simulation results will be, without needing to create or use different pseudopotentials for each specific scenario. A non-transferable or poorly transferable pseudopotential may only work well for a specific structural configuration or state, and if used outside of those constraints, it may yield inaccurate results or predictions. Therefore, when choosing pseudopotentials for your simulations, it's important to select ones that have been tested and shown to have good transferability for the types of systems and range of conditions you are interested in studying. The pseudopotentials provided in standardized libraries like SSSP are often chosen because they have been vetted for their transferability and reliability across a variety of conditions."},{"prompt":"well the computation is still running , showing that using all 12 cores and 24 threads isnt that great , i''ll have to get it working with the new nvidia thingy . that will be very interesting but a whole can of worms to get it set up im sure lol , i have so many setup and running complications its a bit of nightmare , but there again I will be doing exfoliated sheets of tio2 doped with boron and nitrogen as my first big test , so i will probably need all that computational power , hmmmmm what a night lol","completion":"Working with high-performance scientific computing can indeed be challenging, but it's also quite rewarding once you get everything set up and optimized. It sounds like you have a complex and computationally demanding project ahead with the simulation of exfoliated sheets of TiO2 doped with boron and nitrogen. Here are some suggestions to help you navigate the next steps: 1. **Parallel Efficiency**: If using all cores and threads didn't improve performance as expected, you might be encountering issues with parallel scaling. This is common when the computational workload isn't enough to efficiently utilize all available cores, or if the interprocess communication overhead becomes a bottleneck. In such cases, using fewer processors might actually be more efficient. 2. **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizing GPU acceleration can indeed provide significant performance improvements for certain types of calculations. If you're interested in using NVIDIA GPUs with Quantum ESPRESSO, you'll need to ensure that your Quantum ESPRESSO build supports GPU acceleration and is compiled with CUDA or OpenCL, along with the necessary linear algebra libraries optimized for GPUs. 3. **Tailoring Your Setup**: Depending on your computational resources, you might need to tailor your simulation setup and compute environment. Consider different hardware configurations, compiler optimizations, and parallelization strategies. 4. **Learning Curve**: Setting up Quantum ESPRESSO to run on GPUs or optimizing for high-performance hardware can have a steep learning curve. You might need to dive into documentation, forums, and user communities for help and best practices. 5. **Batch Systems and Job Scheduling**: If you have access to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, familiarize yourself with the batch scheduling system (like SLURM or PBS) for submitting jobs. Clusters often have GPUs available, and the batch scripts allow precise control over the resources used. 6. **Validation and Testing**: When making significant changes to your computational setup, it's important to validate the results. Initially run smaller test systems to ensure that the GPU-accelerated version of Quantum ESPRESSO produces consistent results with the CPU-only version. 7. **Pseudopotentials and Input Optimization**: As discussed previously, make sure you're using optimal pseudopotentials for your system. Also, for complex systems like doped TiO2 sheets, carefully consider the convergence parameters (k-points, energy cutoff, etc.) to ensure accurate results without unnecessarily increasing computation time. Remember to approach this incrementally. Get each component working correctly on its own before trying to integrate it into a more complex setup. It's quite common in computational material science to face setup and optimization challenges, so keep experimenting and learning from each trial.

Websites like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy are great places to start. 2. **Community Forums**: Engage with online forums and user communities related to Quantum ESPRESSO and computational materials science. The Quantum ESPRESSO mailing list, Materials Stack Exchange (previously known as Matter Modeling Stack Exchange), and relevant subreddits can be invaluable sources of information and support. 3. **Documentation**: Read through the official documentation for Quantum ESPRESSO thoroughly.

Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions!"},{"prompt":"does cooling a liquid help nanoparticles to sink to the bottom ? like keeping it constantly the same coldness","completion":"The behavior of nanoparticles in a liquid suspension (also known as a colloid) when subjected to cooling is influenced by a variety of factors. In general, cooling a liquid can influence the behavior of suspended nanoparticles, but whether or not it helps the nanoparticles sink to the bottom depends on specific conditions and the physical principles involved: 1. **Brownian Motion**: Nanoparticles suspended in a liquid are subject to Brownian motion, which is the random movement of particles due to collisions with the molecules of the liquid. Cooling the liquid will reduce the kinetic energy of the molecules, which could diminish the intensity of the Brownian motion and potentially lead to a higher rate of sedimentation. 2. **Viscosity**: Cooling a liquid generally increases its viscosity. A higher viscosity can lead to slower movement of nanoparticles and may increase the rate at which they settle out of suspension if the increased drag force overcomes the thermal motion. 3. **Density Differences**: Cooling the liquid can sometimes change its density. If the nanoparticles have a different coefficient of thermal expansion compared to the fluid, cooling could potentially affect the relative buoyancy and the sedimentation behavior. 4. **Aggregation**: Lower temperatures can sometimes enhance aggregation of nanoparticles if the attractive forces between particles become more significant than the thermal energy that keeps them apart. If nanoparticles aggregate, they form larger clusters that are more likely to settle due to increased weight and reduced stability as colloidal systems. 5. **Solute Effects**: Certain solutes within the liquid might become less soluble upon cooling, potentially leading to nucleation sites for particle aggregation or changing the surface interaction between the nanoparticles and the liquid. It is important to note that these effects could either promote or inhibit the sedimentation of nanoparticles, depending on the specific type of nanoparticles, the composition of the liquid, the temperature change, and the timescale of observation. In some cases, the cooling process could encourage particles to settle, but in others, it might have little effect or even inhibit settling due to increased viscosity or changes in particle interactions. In practical applications, if sedimentation of the nanoparticles is desired, it may be more effective to employ centrifugation or other mechanical means to quicken the process, as cooling alone might not be sufficiently efficient or predictable. Always consider the physicochemical properties of the suspension system when predicting the outcome of temperature changes."},{"prompt":"i also wondered about winemaking techniques , like adding bentonite or similar things to make it sink , separation is another problem but it's an idea , i'd like you to explore it and think of all the other finings or similar things used in chemistry too , to make the particles sink , agglomeration isnt my concern , it is good for this situation even of course.","completion":"In winemaking, as in many other chemical and processing industries, clarification and stabilization of liquid suspensions often involve adding substances that help fine particles aggregate and precipitate out of solution. This process is similar to what you're exploring for nanoparticles. Here are a few common fining agents and clarification techniques used in winemaking and chemistry that you can consider: 1. **Bentonite**: It is a type of clay composed mainly of montmorillonite and is used in winemaking to remove proteins that can cause haze in wine. Bentonite carries a negative charge, which allows it to bind to positively charged particles (like certain proteins) and facilitate their precipitation. 2. **Gelatin**: Gelatin is a positive-charging fining agent that can bind with negatively charged particles, causing them to aggregate and settle. It's often used in conjunction with other fining agents like tannins or silica sol. 3. **Isinglass**: Made from the swim bladders of fish, isinglass is another positively charged fining agent that helps to remove yeast and other fine particulate matter from wine. 4. **Casein**: Derived from milk, casein is used to fine white wines and functions similarly to gelatin by binding with and precipitating suspended particles. 5. **Egg Whites**: With proteins that carry a positive charge, egg whites are traditionally used in the fining of red wine to remove excess tannins, thus softening the wine. 6. **Silica Sol (Silicon Dioxide)**: Silica sol is a negatively charged colloidal solution that can attract positively charged particles and encourage them to settle out. 7. **Tannins**: These are sometimes added to wine to bind with proteins and aid in clarification. In a broader chemical context, similar principles are employed to facilitate the settling of particles: 1. **Flocculants**: Chemicals such as aluminum sulfate (alum) or polyelectrolytes are used in water treatment to aggregate particles into larger flocs, which then settle more easily under gravity. 2. **pH Adjustment**: Changing the pH of a solution can alter the net charge of particles, promoting aggregation and settling. This is often used in conjunction with other clarification techniques. 3. **Centrifugation**: For rapid separation, centrifugal force is used to drive particles (and aggregated flocs) out of suspension and towards the bottom of the centrifuge tube. 4. **Filtration**: Although not a settling technique, filtration can separate particles from liquids when gravitational settling is too slow or inefficient. The choice of fining agent or technique is dictated by the nature of the particles and the desired clarity of the liquid. In your case, where agglomeration is acceptable or even advantageous, you could experiment with additives that promote flocculation, similar to how bentonite works in wine. You would look for agents that can bind to your specific type of nanoparticles and encourage them to form larger aggregates, increasing their settling rate. Considering particle charges and the chemistry of the liquid medium will be critical in selecting the most appropriate agent. Additionally, you might want to conduct small-scale trials to identify the best treatment before scaling up, akin to the bench trials performed by winemakers when choosing fining agents for their products."},{"prompt":"so lets think of titanium dioxide nanoparticles , what finings or floccuants might be good . also things like Casein or egg white may be good since it can be destroyed in a tube furnace and thereby releasing the nanoparticles in their pure state ( no finings anymore)","completion":"For titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in aqueous suspension, if you're looking for agents that can promote flocculation and can then be removed by heat treatment, you'll need to consider substances that can withstand the kilning process without leaving undesirable residues. Here are some options: 1. **Organic Polymers**: Water-soluble polymers which can act as flocculants by bridging between particles. Examples include polyacrylamide and its derivatives. These would burn off during a heat treatment stage, but you'll need to ensure that any residual carbon is acceptable for your process or can be removed by further treatment. 2. **Natural Polysaccharides**: Products such as alginate, chitosan, or xanthan gum can be used as flocculants. These substances would also burn off when exposed to sufficiently high temperatures, leaving behind the TiO2 nanoparticles. 3. **Proteins**: As you mentioned, casein and egg whites are options since they are composed of proteins that can aggregate with particles and be removed by thermal treatment. However, carefully consider the potential for leaving carbonaceous material behind, which could contaminate your nanoparticles unless you process at a high enough temperature to ensure complete combustion in an appropriate atmosphere. 4. **Inorganic Salts**: Inorganic salts like aluminum sulfate (alum) are commonly used in water treatment to cause particle aggregation. These would not be appropriate for your application if you require the flocculant to be entirely removed by heat, as they may not decompose completely and could leave behind inorganic residues. 5. **Silica Sol**: Another option could be silica sol, while noting that the heat required to decompose silica is very high, and it might not be suitable if you require complete removal of the flocculant. Before settling on a particular flocculant, you should also consider the post-treatment to ensure purity: - **Temperature Control**: The calcination or annealing temperature must be high enough to completely decompose and volatilize the organic flocculant without affecting the structural integrity of the TiO2 nanoparticles. - **Atmosphere**: Calcination should typically be conducted in an atmosphere that promotes complete combustion of the organic material (e.g., air or oxygen-rich environment). A reducing atmosphere could instead lead to incomplete combustion and carbon contamination. - **Residue Removal**: Any residues left after burning off the flocculant need to be removable without affecting the TiO2 nanoparticles. This could involve washing, further heat treatments, or chemical treatments. Careful experimental planning and trials will be necessary to determine the best process conditions for your specific nanoparticles and applications. Make sure to perform characterization of the final product to confirm that you achieve both the desired purity and that the thermal treatment hasn't altered the nanoparticle characteristics in unwanted ways. Consulting with someone experienced in nanoparticle synthesis and post-processing could further refine your approach."},{"prompt":"ok lets try to think of similar things but ones that can evaporate off , there must be substances that do the job but are volatile","completion":"For a flocculant that can be easily removed from a suspension of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles by volatilization, you would want to consider agents that are volatile at relatively low temperatures and capable of inducing flocculation or aggregation without leaving behind non-volatile residues. In general, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) might serve such a purpose. Here are some potential candidates for volatile flocculants or agents that could assist in the process: 1. **Alcohols**: Certain alcohols with relatively low boiling points, such as ethanol or isopropanol, can change the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles and promote aggregation. They can easily be removed by evaporation under mild heating or reduced pressure. 2. **Organic Acids**: Acetic acid or formic acid could potentially induce flocculation by altering the pH of the solution. These organic acids have boiling points that allow for easy removal by evaporation. 3. **Acetone**: Acetone is a common solvent with a low boiling point that can induce flocculation in some systems. Its high volatility makes it easy to remove by evaporation, but careful attention is needed as acetone can dissolve or affect a variety of materials. 4. **Volatile Amines**: Some amines could potentially help aggregate nanoparticles and can be removed by evaporation due to their low boiling points. Examples include triethylamine or ethanolamine. When considering a volatile agent, it's crucial to ensure that its boiling point is low enough to allow for easy removal without causing thermal degradation of the TiO2 nanoparticles or posing safety hazards due to flammability or toxicity. You would also need to conduct tests to ensure that the agent effectively promotes aggregation and can be completely removed to avoid contamination. Additionally, the chosen volatile agent should: - Be compatible with the TiO2 nanoparticles, avoiding any adverse reactions. - Not introduce impurities or byproducts that could remain after evaporation. - Be environmentally safe and easy to handle under your operating conditions. Given these considerations, the actual utility of volatile flocculants is somewhat limited, and careful experimental validation will be needed. Typically, flocculation is achieved by higher molecular weight, non-volatile additives that enhance particle-particle interactions, but if volatilization is a key factor, you may need to balance the requirement for aggregation against the ease of removal and choose an additive that offers the best compromise."},{"prompt":"lets think of finings , flocculants and any other thoughts on similar things ,. lets exhaust the list . we need them all","completion":"When considering fining agents, flocculants, and related compounds for clarification processes in various industries (including winemaking, brewing, water treatment, and nanoparticle processing), there is a wide variety of substances used to induce coagulation, flocculation, or precipitation of suspended particles. Here's an exhaustive list, which includes agents that may be volatile as well as those that are not: 1. **Inorganic Flocculants**: - Aluminum sulfate (alum) - Ferric chloride - Ferric sulfate - Poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) 2. **Organic Flocculants**: - Polyacrylamide (and its derivatives) - Polyethyleneimine - Polyanionic cellulose - Cationic starch 3. **Natural and Biopolymers**: - Chitosan - Alginate - Guar gum - Gelatin - Agar 4. **Protein-based Agents**: - Casein - Isinglass - Egg albumin (egg whites) - Whey protein 5. **Carbohydrate-based Agents**: - Maltodextrin - Pectin - Xanthan gum 6. **Silica-based Fining Agents**: - Silica sol - Silica gel 7. **Tannin-based Agents**: - Tannic acid - Grape or oak tannin 8. **Acidifiers and pH Modifiers**: - Citric acid - Tartaric acid - Phosphoric acid 9. **Volatile Compounds**: - Acetic acid - Formic acid - Ethanol - Isopropanol - Acetone - Volatile amines (e.g., triethylamine) 10. **Other Chemicals**: - Bentonite (clay) - Diatomaceous earth - Activated carbon - Limestone 11. **Enzymatic Fining Agents**: - Lysozyme - Pectinase - Beta-glucanase 12. **Miscellaneous**: - Activated charcoal - Hydrogen peroxide (used sparingly and carefully for specific purposes) 13. **Surfactants and Detergents** (used in some industrial processes for cleaning and clarification): - Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) - Triton X-100 It is important to note that while this list is extensive, the applicability of each substance depends on the specific characteristics of the particles to be settled (such as charge, size, and surface properties), the medium they are suspended in, and the desired outcome of the process (such as purity and the method of disposal or recycling of spent agents). For processes where the end goal is recovery of nanoparticles without contamination from the flocculants, volatile or easily decomposable substances are preferred. As such, some agents listed above might not be suitable for applications where residual contamination is a concern. Regardless of the chosen agent, it is critical to consider the operating conditions, such as pH, temperature, and mixing methods, to maximize efficiency and minimize the risk of adverse reactions. Additionally, environmental regulations and safety protocols should guide the selection and handling of these chemicals. It is always prudent to carry out small-scale trials before scaling up to larger operations."},{"prompt":"of the ones that can be burnt off which one/s are the most suitable leaving the least residual carbon or substances","completion":"When considering fining agents or flocculants that can be burnt off, leaving the least amount of residual carbon or substances, the selection narrows down to those that are organic and have high purity, with no or minimal inorganic content. For titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle processing, you would specifically look for agents that can be easily pyrolyzed at temperatures that don't affect the TiO2 structure. Here are some suitable candidates that fall within this criterion: 1. **Protein-based Agents**: - **Gelatin**: Used as a fining agent in winemaking to help clarify liquids, it burns off cleanly but may require relatively high temperatures to ensure complete combustion. - **Casein**: A milk protein that can be used as a fining agent, similar to gelatin. It requires complete burning off to avoid residual carbon. 2. **Polysaccharides**: - **Alginate** and **Chitosan**: While these are not typically volatile, they can be incinerated at high temperatures to leave minimal residue provided there is a sufficient oxygen supply. 3. **Volatile Organic Compounds**: - **Ethanol** and **Isopropanol**: Alcohols can promote flocculation (though not strongly) and are easily evaporated without leaving residues. They are not typically used as primary flocculating agents but can alter the solution properties to aid sedimentation. They combust completely to carbon dioxide and water with sufficient oxygen. - **Acetone**: Another substance that can alter the dispersion stability of nanoparticles and is fully volatile. Acetone is not a traditional flocculant but might be used to modify solvent properties to aid in particle settling. 4. **Organic Acids**: - **Acetic Acid** and **Formic Acid**: While primarily serving as pH adjusters rather than strong flocculants, they are both volatile and can be completely burned off. 5. **Enzymatic Agents**: - **Lysozyme**: Used for lysing bacterial cell walls in winemaking, it is a protein that can burn off at high temperatures, similar to gelatin and casein. When pyrolyzing these substances, it is crucial to conduct the process in an oxygen-rich environment to ensure complete combustion and avoid the formation of char or residual carbon. The temperatures must be sufficiently high to combust the organic material but not so high as to sinter or otherwise alter the TiO2 nanoparticles. It's also important to consider that if the selected agent is not traditionally used as a flocculant, its ability to induce flocculation might be limited, and thus additional measures may be required to aid the settling process. The agents selected must also be appropriate for the end-use of the TiO2 nanoparticles. For example, any substance introduced to a system meant for medical or food-related applications must be non-toxic and approved for such use, even if it will be removed later. Each substance will have its own effectiveness and practicality based on its chemical properties and the specific conditions of the nanoparticle suspension, so testing and optimization are key to finding the best solution for your application. As always, thorough characterization after treatment is needed to ensure purity and lack of contamination."},{"prompt":"So I have a game on steam called Superfighters Deluxe and I wanted to do a yolov5 object detection.

It is worth noting that not all people agree on what constitutes an error, as interpretations of the text can vary widely, and some might believe that the Bible is inerrant in its original form. Nevertheless, here are ten points of contention regarding historical accuracy: 1. **Creation in Six Days:** - The account of creation in Genesis posits that the world was created in six days. This conflicts with the scientific consensus on the age of the Earth and the gradual process of evolution over billions of years. 2. **Global Flood and Noah's Ark:** - The narrative of a worldwide flood and the story of Noah's Ark is considered implausible by most geologists and biologists, as there is no evidence of a global flood occurring in the relatively recent past, and the story's logistics regarding animal species and boat size are deemed impossible. 3. **The Tower of Babel:** - The story of the Tower of Babel, which explains the origin of multiple languages, is not supported by linguistic evidence. Historical linguistics has shown that languages evolve over long periods of time and do not stem from a single event. 4. **The Exodus:** - There is a lack of archaeological evidence for the mass exodus of Israelites from Egypt as described in the book of Exodus, including the scale of the migration and evidence of their wanderings in the desert. 5. **The Conquest of Canaan:** - The book of Joshua's account of the Israelites' rapid and complete conquest of Canaan does not fully align with the archaeological record, which suggests a more gradual process of settlement and cultural assimilation. 6. **The Existence of the Patriarchs:** - Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, known as the Patriarchs, have not been definitively corroborated with archaeological or historical evidence, and their existence remains a matter of faith rather than historical fact. 7. **The United Monarchy under David and Solomon:** - Evidence for the grandeur and extent of the kingdom under David and Solomon is sparse, leading some to suggest that their kingdoms may not have been as expansive and prosperous as described in the Bible. 8. **The Nativity Star:** - The story of the Star of Bethlehem, which is said to have guided the Magi to Jesus' birthplace, is debated among astronomers, with various theories but no confirmed historical astronomical event that aligns with the timeline. 9. **The Census of Quirinius:** - The Gospel of Luke mentions a census taken while Quirinius was governing Syria and suggests that this prompted Joseph and Mary to travel to Bethlehem, but historical records indicate that Quirinius' census took place in 6 AD, which is inconsistent with the time of Jesus' birth if he was born during the reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4 BC. 10. **The Population of the Israelite Army:** - Numbers in the Old Testament often give very high counts for the Israelite army, in some cases surpassing numbers that would be feasible for the population and logistic capabilities at the time. It's essential to consider that the Bible is also a religious document and not strictly a historical text, and many people interpret its stories as allegorical or symbolic rather than literal historical accounts. Disagreements over biblical history often exist between secular scholars, religious scholars, and believers with different viewpoints regarding the text's divine inspiration and the nature of its authority."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Certainly. Here are additional points often discussed as potential historical inaccuracies or anachronisms in the Bible: 11. **The Walls of Jericho:** - Archaeological evidence regarding the city of Jericho and its walls does not match the biblical account of the walls falling after the Israelites marched around them and blew their trumpets. Some evidence suggests the city had been abandoned by the time of Joshua. 12. **Sodom and Gomorrah:** - The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is a well-known biblical event, but archaeologists have not been able to confirm the existence of these cities or the dramatic events surrounding their demise as described in Genesis. 13. **The Fable of Jonah and the Whale:** - The tale of Jonah being swallowed by a \\"great fish\\" or whale and surviving in its belly for three days is difficult to reconcile with our understanding of biology and lacks historical evidence. 14. **Belshazzar's Kingship:** - The Book of Daniel refers to Belshazzar as King of Babylon, but historical records indicate that while Belshazzar was a ruler in Babylon, he was not the king. The king at the time was actually his father, Nabonidus. 15. **The Fiery Furnace:** - The story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego surviving the fiery furnace in the Book of Daniel is miraculous and does not align with the known laws of physics and biology, making it a matter of faith rather than history. 16. **Hittites Mentioned as a Major Power:** - For many years, the Bible's references to the Hittites as a significant power were doubted by historians due to a lack of evidence. However, this is an example where later archaeological discoveries confirmed much about the Hittite civilization, showing that earlier skepticism was misplaced. 17. **The Sun Standing Still:** - In the Book of Joshua, it's told that the sun stood still to prolong the daylight for battle. This event is not supported by astronomical observations and violates principles of physics related to the motion of celestial bodies. 18. **Taxation and the Birth of Jesus:** - The narrative about Joseph and Mary traveling to Bethlehem for a Roman tax census is historically problematic. Such censuses typically did not require participants to travel to ancestral homes, and moreover, there's no record of a census that matches the specific timeframe and conditions described in the Gospel. 19. **The Giant Races:** - The Bible occasionally mentions giants, such as the Nephilim or the Anakim. There is no scientific or archaeological evidence for the existence of a race of giants as described in these ancient texts. 20. **Daniel's Lions' Den:** - The story of Daniel surviving a night in a den of lions is another biblical event that is not supported by historical evidence and is considered a miracle or a parable rather than a historical occurrence. It's essential to remember that many of the narratives in the Bible are interpreted differently within various religious and scholarly communities. While some view these stories as literal history, others see them as allegorical or symbolic literature meant to convey moral, spiritual, and theological lessons. Historians and archaeologists generally seek corroborating evidence when assessing biblical accounts against historical records and material findings, but the lack of such evidence does not necessarily detract from the spiritual or moral significance these stories hold for believers."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Certainly, while looking for additional potential historical inaccuracies or points of critique in the Bible, it's important to exercise sensitivity as these texts hold significant spiritual meaning for many people. Scholars approach the Bible with various assumptions and methodologies, with some viewing it as a collection of divine revelations and others as an anthology of historical documents subject to the same scrutiny as any other ancient texts. Here are more points often discussed: 21. **The Philistine Anachronism:** - The presence of Philistines in the narratives of Abraham and Isaac is considered an anachronism by some scholars since the arrival of the Philistines in the region occurred much later than the time in which the Patriarchs are traditionally dated. 22. **The Story of Job:** - The Book of Job is a rich theological text that discusses the nature of suffering and God's justice. Historical evidence for the events described in the book, including Job's specific trials and dialogues, is lacking, which leads many scholars to view the book as a literary, philosophical, and theological composition rather than a historical record. 23. **Camels in Genesis:** - The Book of Genesis portrays camels as domesticated animals used during the time of Abraham. However, archaeological evidence suggests that camels were not widely domesticated in the region until much later, potentially making their presence in these early narratives anachronistic. 24. **The Slavery in Egypt:** - While the Bible describes the Israelites being enslaved in Egypt and contributing to large-scale construction projects, Egyptian records and archaeological surveys do not corroborate the presence of a large enslaved Israelite population nor their role in building projects such as the pyramids. 25. **The Immaculate Conception:** - The New Testament account of Mary's virginal conception of Jesus is a matter of religious faith and belief rather than a historically verifiable event. Claims of virgin births are generally not supported by biological science. 26. **The Longevity of the Patriarchs:** - Several Biblical figures, especially in the early Genesis narratives, are said to have lived for hundreds of years. These extreme ages are beyond known human lifespans and are not supported by historical or scientific evidence. 27. **Jesus' Trial Before Sanhedrin:** - The Gospels' accounts of Jesus being tried by the Jewish council (Sanhedrin) at night and during Passover conflict with Jewish legal customs, which did not permit trials by night or on feast days. 28. **The Darkness at Crucifixion:** - The Gospels report that darkness fell over the land for three hours during Jesus' crucifixion. There is no contemporary extrabiblical account that corroborates this supernatural event, which would have been a remarkable phenomenon. 29. **Two Different Genealogies of Jesus:** - The New Testament provides two genealogies for Jesus (one in Matthew and one in Luke), and they differ significantly from each other. This raises questions about their historical accuracy as literal genealogical records. 30. **Cyrus' Proclamation:** - The book of Ezra credits Cyrus, the king of Persia, with issuing a proclamation that permitted the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. While there is extrabiblical evidence supporting the policy of Cyrus allowing exiled peoples to return to their homelands, the precise proclamation as described in Ezra lacks corroboration from Persian records. Once again, it should be emphasized that the understanding of these points can vary greatly among different readers and scholars. Some individuals might interpret the Bible in a strictly literal way, while others might understand it allegorically or theologically. Therefore, what might be considered a \\"historical error\\" in one perspective could be seen as a symbolic or spiritually significant narrative in another."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Sure, here are more examples where biblical narratives have been discussed in terms of their historical veracity: 31. **The Sun Dial of Ahaz:** - In the Book of Isaiah, it is described that the sun went backward ten steps on the sun dial of Ahaz as a sign from God. This would suggest a reversal of the earth's rotation, which has no corroboration from historical records or the understanding of celestial mechanics. 32. **The New Testament Quirinius Census:** - In addition to the timing issues already mentioned, there is also a more general discrepancy—Roman censuses typically did not require people to return to their ancestral homes, which is what causes Mary and Joseph to go to Bethlehem in the biblical account. 33. **Darius the Mede:** - The Book of Daniel refers to a king named \\"Darius the Mede,\\" who supposedly took over Babylon after its conquest by the Medes and Persians. Historians have been unable to find evidence for such a king in the historical records that exist from that time. 34. **Ancient Dietary Laws:** - The strict dietary laws found in Leviticus don't always align with what is known about ancient nutrition and food preparation practices, leading some scholars to view these more as cultural or religious markers rather than historical advisement. 35. **Paul's Conversion on the Road to Damascus:** - Acts of the Apostles describes Paul's dramatic conversion experience on the road to Damascus. The account presents a supernatural event with no external historical evidence to support the details of the occurrence, such as the bright light and audible voice from heaven. 36. **Animals on the Ark:** - In addition to the improbability of a global flood, the idea that two of every animal species could live on a single ark and then repopulate the earth lacks credibility from a biodiversity and logistics standpoint. 37. **The Battle of Jericho's Trumpets:** - The collapse of Jericho's walls at the sound of trumpets, as related in Joshua, is considered miraculous. The destruction of a city's fortifications in such a manner contradicts our understanding of physics and warfare and lacks archaeological corroboration. 38. **Esther's Role in the Persian Court:** - The Book of Esther describes events in the Persian court, including the Jewish queen Esther influencing King Ahasuerus. While it's a foundational story for the Jewish holiday of Purim, there is little to no extrabiblical evidence of Esther's existence or the events described. 39. **Jesus' Cleansing of the Temple:** - The event where Jesus is said to have expelled money changers and merchants from the Temple in Jerusalem reflects a significant event that likely would have been noted in contemporary records, yet it appears only in the New Testament texts. 40. **The Earth Until the Great Flood:** - The Bible suggests in Genesis that before the Flood, there had not yet been rain upon the Earth, with a mist rising from the ground to water plants. This explanation of pre-Flood Earth's water cycle lacks support from geological and hydrological evidence. These examples illustrate how history, as reconstructed through archeology and ancient texts, doesn't always align with biblical narratives. Scholars may view some biblical passages as metaphorical, theological, or etiological rather than historical. Each of these points can be complex and a matter of interpretation; they are not universally accepted and continue to be subjects of debate among religious scholars, theologians, historians, and archaeologists. Additionally, some of these supposed \\"errors\\" may stem from later copying and translation issues rather than the original texts. It's vital to consider the multifaceted purpose and use of these texts within the communities that hold them to be sacred."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Certainly. Below are more points of discussion regarding historical discrepancies or areas of contention between scholarly findings and biblical accounts: 41. **The Census Under Augustus:** - Luke's Gospel mentions that Caesar Augustus called for a census of \\"all the world.\\" Historical records show that Augustus did order a census, but they were localized to the Roman provinces and not a single global event. 42. **Language of Jesus:** - The New Testament often depicts Jesus speaking directly in Greek quotations. However, he most likely spoke Aramaic as his primary language, with Greek being a later literary translation by authors of the New Testament. 43. **The Egyptian Plagues:** - The ten plagues sent by God in the Book of Exodus have not been independently corroborated by Egyptian historical or archaeological records, and there is a lack of evidence for such widespread and catastrophic events occurring simultaneously. 44. **The Wealth of Solomon:** - The descriptions of Solomon's immense wealth and the extravagant temple he built in Jerusalem are not supported by the archaeological evidence, which paints a picture of a more modest Jerusalem during this period. 45. **The Story of Balaam:** - In the Book of Numbers, Balaam is a non-Israelite prophet who has a conversation with a talking donkey. While Balaam is mentioned in other ancient Near Eastern texts, the story's supernatural elements, such as a talking animal, are not supported by historical evidence. 46. **The Specificity of Old Testament Laws:** - The Old Testament contains many detailed laws with specific rituals and procedures (e.g., the construction and use of the Tabernacle, priesthood ordinances). There is a lack of archaeological evidence for the widespread and specific practice of many of these laws in the context in which they were supposedly given. 47. **The Chronology of the Kings of Israel and Judah:** - The chronology ascribed to the reigns of the various kings in the books of Kings and Chronicles is difficult to reconcile with known historical dates and records from surrounding nations. 48. **Herod's Massacre of the Innocents:** - Matthew's Gospel narrates King Herod's order to kill all male infants in Bethlehem to eliminate the newborn Jesus, known as the Massacre of the Innocents. No historical records outside the Bible, including those by Herod's contemporaries, mention this event. 49. **Quail from the Sea:** - The Book of Numbers describes a wind blowing quail from the sea to provide meat to the Israelites in the desert. Ornithologically, this story seems improbable as quails do not usually migrate across seas in such abundant numbers as would be required to feed a large population. 50. **Rahab's Scarlet Cord:** - The story of Rahab in Joshua, who is said to have helped Israelite spies and was spared during the fall of Jericho because she hung a scarlet cord in her window, is a unique account without any outside corroboration. It is important to remember that not every detail in an ancient text needs contemporary corroboration to be considered historically plausible. Some biblical events could be symbolic or illustrative, while others could be genuine historical recollections that simply lack archaeological or textual confirmation. Moreover, the historical-critical approach to the biblical text, which became popular in the 19th and 20th centuries, often challenges traditional interpretations but also complements theological understandings by providing historical and cultural contexts for the narratives. As with any ancient historical document, scholars strive to distinguish between different genres within the text (mythological, historical, poetic, prophetic, etc.) and understand each part accordingly. Many details of biblical narratives might have had different meanings for the original audience than contemporary readers would typically perceive. Historical and archaeological research often sheds new light on ancient texts, sometimes supporting and other times challenging traditional readings and interpretations."},{"prompt":"give me 20 more","completion":"Exploring historical accuracy in biblical texts necessitates an understanding that such discussions can involve sensitive matters of faith. While many treat the Bible as a sacred religious document, historians and textual critics examine it similarly to other ancient texts, looking for corroborating evidence and assessing historical plausibility. Here are additional points that are often mentioned in scholarly discussions regarding historical discrepancies in the Bible: 51. **The Book of Judith:** - The narrative of Judith involves historical inaccuracies, such as Nebuchadnezzar reigning over Assyria from Nineveh when in fact he was the king of Babylon, suggesting the story is more of a parable than a literal historical account. 52. **The Destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar:** - Ezekiel prophesized that Nebuchadnezzar would completely destroy the city of Tyre, but historical records indicate that while the city was besieged, it was not destroyed to the extent prophesized within Ezekiel's lifetime. 53. **Jonah's Prophecy Against Nineveh:** - The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as an exceedingly large city that would be overthrown in forty days, but there is no historical record of Jonah's prophecy or the massive repentance of the Ninevites. 54. **Jephthah's Sacrifice:** - In Judges, Jephthah vows to sacrifice whatever comes out of his house to meet him if he returns victorious from battle. The narrative ends with the sacrifice of his daughter, a practice not corroborated by historical evidence and contrary to later Jewish law. 55. **The Long Day of Joshua:** - Beyond the sun standing still, Joshua 10 also mentions that the moon stopped. Such a celestial event would have notable effects on the entire planet and likely be recorded by other civilizations, but no corroborating evidence exists. 56. **Biblical Giants in Genesis:** - Besides the Nephilim, Genesis also mentions the \\"sons of God\\" and the \\"daughters of men\\" producing a race of giants, an event for which there is no evidence outside the biblical text. 57. **The Number of Israelites in the Exodus:** - The Bible estimates 600,000 men, plus women and children, left Egypt, suggesting a group of potentially over two million, a number that is difficult to reconcile with the archaeological record of the Sinai and the logistics of such a migration. 58. **Absence of Egyptian Records of Joseph:** - Despite Joseph's purported significant role in Egypt as described in Genesis, there are no Egyptian records or inscriptions validating his presence or the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine he predicted. 59. **The Danites Capturing Laish:** - The Book of Judges describes the tribe of Dan capturing the city of Laish and renaming it Dan. However, archaeological evidence suggests the city of Dan was inhabited continuously and may not correspond with the biblical narrative's timeline. 60. **Linguistic Anachronisms:** - The Book of Genesis contains some names and terms that are anachronistic for the time periods they supposedly represent, reflecting the linguistic context of later authors instead of the time of the Patriarchs. 61. **The Pool of Bethesda:** - Described in the Gospel of John as having five covered colonnades where an angel would trouble the waters, the Pool of Bethesda has not been definitively identified, and its miraculous healing narrative has no extra-biblical corroboration. 62. **The Age of Terah:** - Genesis and Acts give contradicting ages for Abraham's father, Terah, at the time of Abraham's departure from Haran, which has led to debates over the ancient timelines presented. 63. **Paul's Visit to Arabia:** - After his conversion, Paul, in Galatians, mentions going to Arabia and then returning to Damascus. This trip to Arabia is not contextualized and lacks archaeological or historical support. 64. **The Sun and Moon in Genesis:** - Genesis 1 describes the creation of the sun and moon on the fourth day to separate day from night. This sequence does not align with the scientific understanding of the development of celestial bodies before the Earth itself formed. 65. **The Wealth of Job:** - The extreme wealth and subsequent misfortunes of Job, as well as the detailed restoration thereof, are hard to verify historically and are generally seen as a means to set the stage for the book's philosophical and theological dialogues. 66. **Destruction of Hazor:** - The Israelites are said to have destroyed Hazor during their invasion of Canaan, but archaeological evidence suggests multiple phases of destruction and occupation that do not match a single conquest narrative. 67. **The Earth's Foundations:** - References to the Earth as having a solid foundation or being immovable in Psalms reflect an ancient cosmology that is inconsistent with modern understanding of Earth's place in the solar system. 68. **The Epistle to Philemon:** - While the personal nature of the letter to Philemon about Onesimus seems plausible, it doesn't provide sufficient context for independent historical verification of the characters involved. 69. **Bathsheba’s Pregnancy:** - In the story of David and Bathsheba, the promptness of Bathsheba's realization of her pregnancy (2 Samuel 11:5) after the single encounter with David raises questions about the timeline's realism. 70. **The Mysterious Melchizedek:** - Melchizedek appears in Genesis and Psalms without a genealogy or much context, and Hebrews later explains that he remains a priest forever. This mysterious figure does not appear in external historical records, making his story enigmatic. These points raise issues of consistency, plausibility, and correlation with extrabiblical evidence. As before, it’s crucial to acknowledge that different faith communities may hold various views on interpreting these texts, with many regarding them as spiritually authoritative irrespective of modern historical and scientific critique. The intention here is not to dispute beliefs but simply to offer an overview of the types of criticism and inquiry these ancient texts commonly receive in scholarly discourse."},{"prompt":"i am gp dovtor","completion":"Hello!

It's usually contrasted with acute or sharp pain, which is more intense and often described as a stabbing or shooting sensation. Dull pain can be continuous or intermittent and is often more diffuse, meaning it's not as localized as sharp pain and can be harder for patients to pinpoint. Some characteristics of dull pain include: - Aching: A common term that patients may use to describe dull pain is an \\"ache.\\" It can be a sensation that is more about discomfort than sharp pain. - Background discomfort: Dull pain might not be as overwhelming as sharp pain, so it may be perceived as a background discomfort. - Chronic: Dull pain is often associated with chronic conditions, whereas sharp pain can be linked to sudden injuries or acute conditions. - Fatigue-inducing: Persistent dull pain can lead to a sense of fatigue or exhaustion, as it requires constant coping. Dull pain can be symptomatic of various medical conditions ranging from muscle strain to inflammatory diseases or internal organ issues. For example, conditions like gastritis, arthritis, and some types of headaches often present with dull pain. It's important for a GP like yourself to assess a patient's pain accurately by asking about the pain's onset, duration, intensity, and associated symptoms, as well as its impact on the patient's daily activities.

Q: What are the most common causes of peptic ulcers? **Peptic Ulcer Causes:** - **H. pylori Infection:** Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a leading cause of peptic ulcers. - **Chronic NSAID Use:** The chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a common contributor to peptic ulcer development. - **Additional Contributing Factors:** - **Smoking:** Tobacco smoking is identified as a contributing factor to peptic ulcers. - **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:** Consuming alcohol excessively can contribute to the development of peptic ulcers. - **Severe Stress:** Stress due to illnesses, especially severe stress, is considered a factor in peptic ulcer formation. - **Certain Medications:** The use of specific medications such as steroids or anticancer drugs may also contribute to peptic ulcers. - 2. Q: Differentiate between a gastric and a duodenal ulcer. - **Gastric Ulcer:** - Located on the lining of the stomach. - Associated with widespread inflammation of the gastric mucosa. - Occasional association with gastric cancer. - Pain worsens after eating. - **Duodenal Ulcer:** - Found in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). - Rarely associated with cancer. - More common than gastric ulcers. - Pain improves with eating or antacids but returns 2-3 hours later. - Pain more pronounced when the stomach is empty, especially at night. - 3. Q: What is the role of H. pylori in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers? - **Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Pathogenic Mechanisms:** 1. **Urease Production:** - Enzyme that converts urea into ammonia and bicarbonate. - Neutralizes the acidic stomach environment. 2. **Induction of Inflammation:** - Elicits an immune response. - Leads to damage of the mucosal lining. - Weakens the stomach’s defense mechanisms. 3. **Release of Toxins and Enzymes:** - Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA). - Directly damages epithelial cells. 4. **Regulation of Acid Secretion:** - Alters the regulation of acid secretion. - Contributes to an acidic environment harmful to the mucosal lining. - **Consequences:** - Creates an environment conducive to mucosal damage and ulcer formation. - Associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer as a long-term complication of chronic infection. - 4. Q: Name three less common causes of peptic ulcers. - **Less Common Causes of Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** - Rare condition with tumors (gastrinomas) in the pancreas or upper small intestine. - Tumors secrete excess gastrin, causing increased stomach acid production. - Results in recurrent and challenging-to-heal ulcers. 2. **Other Medications:** - Besides NSAIDs, medications like steroids, SSRIs, potassium supplements, and bisphosphonates. - High doses or prolonged use can contribute to peptic ulcer development. 3. **Lifestyle Factors:** - Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. - Increase stomach acid production and reduce the protective mucous lining, making the stomach more susceptible to ulcers. 4. **Medical Conditions:** - Severe physiologic stress from medical conditions. - Shock, severe burns (Curling’s ulcer), intracranial injury (Cushing’s ulcer), or critical illness can lead to stress ulcers. 5. **Genetic Factors:** - Genetic predisposition in some individuals. - Increased risk for developing peptic ulcers. 6. **Viral infections:** - In very rare cases, viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), can cause ulcers, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. - 5. Q: What is Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and how does it relate to peptic ulcer disease? - **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES):** - Rare disorder characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas). - Tumors typically in the pancreas or upper small intestine (duodenum). - Results in excessive gastrin production, stimulating stomach acid and enzyme secretion. - **Clinical Effects:** - Elevated gastrin levels cause markedly increased stomach hydrochloric acid. - Overwhelms mucosal defense, leading to severe, recurrent peptic ulcers. - Ulcers are often numerous and may occur in atypical areas, including the small intestine. - Symptoms: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms due to high acid levels. - **Association with MEN1:** - ZES is associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). - MEN1 increases the risk of other endocrine tumors. - **Management:** - Aggressive acid suppression with high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). - Treatment directed at the gastrinoma: - Surgical resection. - Medication. - Other forms of therapy to control tumor growth and prevent complications. - 6. Q: How do NSAIDs contribute to the formation of peptic ulcers? - **NSAIDs and Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **Inhibition of Prostaglandin Synthesis:** - NSAIDs block COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. - Inhibition of COX-1 reduces prostaglandin production in the stomach. - Prostaglandins promote mucosal blood flow, stimulate bicarbonate and mucus secretion, and maintain gastric lining integrity. 2. **Direct Mucosal Damage:** - NSAIDs, being weak acids, directly irritate the gastric epithelium. - Direct irritation leads to mucosal damage and erosion. 3. **Impaired Mucosal Defense:** - Reduced prostaglandin synthesis diminishes the gastric mucosa’s ability to resist injury from gastric acid. - Impaired defense allows acid to cause further damage, leading to ulceration. 4. **Disruption of Mucosal Repair:** - NSAIDs not only impair protective factors but also impede mucosal recovery and repair after injury. 5. **Systemic Effects:** - NSAIDs cause systemic effects reducing gastroduodenal mucosa protection. - Effects include decreased blood flow to mucosal tissue, hindering healing and contributing to ulcer formation. - **Risk Factors for NSAID-induced Ulcers:** - Can occur in anyone using NSAIDs. - Higher risk with: - Higher doses. - Longer therapy duration. - History of peptic ulcer disease. - Elderly individuals. - Other risk factors. - **Cautious NSAID Use:** - Important to use NSAIDs cautiously, especially in populations at increased risk for peptic ulcers. - Consider gastroprotective agents (proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol) in high-risk patients. - 7. Q: Which factors can increase the risk of peptic ulcer development? - **Risk Factors for Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **H. pylori Infection:** - Most common cause significantly increases ulcer risk. 2. **Chronic NSAID Use:** - Regular use of ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, especially at higher doses, increases ulcer risk. 3. **Smoking:** - Nicotine in tobacco increases stomach acid and impairs healing, making smokers more susceptible to ulcers. 4. **Alcohol Consumption:** - Heavy alcohol use irritates and erodes the stomach lining, increasing acid production. 5. **Corticosteroid Medication:** - Corticosteroids, especially combined with NSAIDs, increase the risk of peptic ulcers. 6. **Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents:** - Warfarin and clopidogrel can raise the risk of bleeding from existing ulcers. 7. **Age:** - Older adults have an increased risk due to NSAID use, H. pylori, and age-related changes in the mucosal lining. 8. **Previous Ulcer History:** - Those with a history of peptic ulcers are more likely to develop them again. 9. **Stress:** - Severe stress, such as trauma or major surgery, can lead to stress-related mucosal disease and ulcers. 10. **Certain Medications:** - SSRIs, bisphosphonates, and potassium supplements can contribute to ulcer risk, especially when not taken as directed or with other ulcerogenic drugs. 11. **Medical Conditions:** - Conditions like Crohn’s disease or liver cirrhosis can increase the risk of peptic ulcers. 12. **Genetic Factors:** - Some families may have a genetic predisposition, as peptic ulcers appear to run in certain families. It is crucial for individuals with these risk factors to discuss ulcer prevention with healthcare providers, involving lifestyle modifications, gastroprotective agents, or H. pylori treatment if indicated. - 8. Q: What are the classic symptoms of a peptic ulcer? - **Classic Symptoms of Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **Epigastric Pain:** - Burning or gnawing pain in the upper middle abdomen, below the sternum (breastbone), extending from the navel to the chest. 2. **Meal-Related Fluctuations:** - Gastric ulcer pain worsens with eating, while duodenal ulcer pain may decrease with meals and return after a few hours. 3. **Nocturnal Pain:** - Duodenal ulcer pain may wake the patient at night. 4. **Antacid Relief:** - Temporary relief with antacids or acid-reducing medications. - **Other Associated Symptoms:** 1. **Bloating and Fullness.** 2. **Belching and Flatulence.** 3. **Nausea or Vomiting.** 4. **Changes in Appetite.** 5. **Weight Loss or Gain.** 6. **Bloody or Black Stools:** - Indicative of ulcer bleeding. 7. **Vomiting Blood:** - May occur with severe ulcer bleeding. These symptoms can vary in intensity and may be intermittent. Some individuals with peptic ulcers may not experience symptoms, and asymptomatic ulcers can be incidentally detected during investigations for other conditions. Additionally, peptic ulcers may present with complications like bleeding or perforation, leading to acute symptoms such as hematemesis, melena, acute abdomen, shock, or sepsis. - 9. Q: What are alarm symptoms in peptic ulcer disease that may suggest complications? **Alarm Symptoms in Peptic Ulcer Disease:** 1. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** - Vomiting blood (hematemesis), appearing as fresh red blood or coffee grounds. - Passing black, tarry stools (melena). 2. **Unintentional Weight Loss:** - Significant weight loss without intentional efforts, associated with malignancy or severe malabsorption. 3. **Progressive Dysphagia:** - Worsening difficulty swallowing, suggesting an obstruction or growth in the di agestive tract. 4. **Odynophagia:** - Painful swallowing, indicating esophageal or gastric ulceration. 5. **Persistent or Severe Vomiting:** - Sign of gastric outlet obstruction. 6. **Unexplained Anemia:** - Low red blood cell counts indicating chronic bleeding from an ulcer. 7. **Early Satiety:** - Feeling full quickly after eating, suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction or a mass. 8. **Palpable Abdominal Mass:** - Presence of a mass in the abdomen, indicating a tumor, enlarged organ, or scar tissue buildup from a healing ulcer. 9. **Acute, Severe Abdominal Pain:** - Sudden, sharp pain, possibly indicating a perforated ulcer or pancreatitis. The presence of any of these symptoms necessitates prompt endoscopic investigation or other relevant diagnostic studies to determine the cause and initiate timely management. Early detection of complications associated with peptic ulcer disease, such as bleeding, perforation, or malignancy, significantly influences prognosis and treatment outcomes. - 10. Q: How would you differentiate between peptic ulcer pain and that of acute pancreatitis? **Differentiating Peptic Ulcer Pain from Acute Pancreatitis:** 1. **Location and Nature of Pain:** - *Peptic Ulcer Pain:* Localized to the epigastric region, described as burning or gnawing, fluctuating in intensity, may radiate to the back. - *Acute Pancreatitis Pain:* Constant, severe, and dull pain, upper abdomen with radiation to the back, intensified after eating, especially fatty meals. 2. **Timing of Pain:** - *Peptic Ulcer Pain:* May worsen after eating (gastric ulcer) or improve after eating and then return later (duodenal ulcer), sometimes awakening at night. - *Acute Pancreatitis Pain:* Comes on quickly, doesn’t vary with eating or time of day. 3. **Associated Symptoms:** - *Peptic Ulcers:* Bloating, belching, temporary relief with antacids. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Persistent nausea, vomiting, fever, swollen and tender abdomen, fetal position for pain relief. 4. **Risk Factors:** - *Peptic Ulcer Disease:* NSAID use, H. pylori infection. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Heavy alcohol use, gallstones, elevated triglyceride levels. 5. **Physical Examination:** - *Peptic Ulcer:* Epigastric tenderness upon palpation. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding, signs like Grey Turner’s or Cullen’s sign. 6. **Laboratory and Imaging:** - *Peptic Ulcer:* Iron-deficiency anemia from chronic bleeding, possibly seen on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), imaging may reveal gallstones (ultrasound). Clinical assessment, including history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic tests, is essential for an accurate diagnosis between peptic ulcer pain and acute pancreatitis.","completion":"Thank you for providing the material you'd like me to test you on.

He admits to having similar, though milder, episodes in the past but never sought medical attention. Additionally, he mentions that he uses over-the-counter ibuprofen frequently for chronic knee pain, and due to recent stress at work, he has increased his intake of ibuprofen and has been smoking more than usual. His appetite has decreased lately, and he feels slightly nauseated after eating, but he denies vomiting or any changes in his bowel habits. On further questioning, he denies noticeable weight loss, hematemesis, or melena.

NSAIDs can disrupt the stomach and duodenal mucosa by inhibiting prostaglandins which protect the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, while smoking can impair ulcer healing and contribute to the worsening of gastric irritation and acid secretion. Now, let's continue with the remaining questions: 3. The patient's frequent use of ibuprofen could contribute to the ulcer formation by inhibiting prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. Smoking, as another risk factor, can impair healing and increase gastric acid secretion. 4. For immediate management, you may consider starting the patient on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce acid secretion and protect the gastrointestinal lining. You would also advise him to avoid NSAIDs and to quit smoking. 5. To confirm the diagnosis, you could order an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to visualize the ulcer and test for H. pylori infection, a main cause of peptic ulcers. Additional tests might include basic blood work to check for anemia or other signs of bleeding and inflammation. 6. For acute management, stopping ibuprofen and initiating a PPI are key. You may also recommend antacids or H2 receptor antagonists for symptomatic relief. For prevention of future complications, you would advise smoking cessation, stress management, avoiding NSAIDs, and if H. pylori is detected treating it accordingly with appropriate antibiotics. You may also discuss protective strategies when NSAIDs are necessary, like co-therapy with a PPI or using a selective COX-2 inhibitor. 7. If the patient returned with symptoms of dark, tarry stools (melena) and dizziness, this could indicate a bleeding ulcer, which is an emergency situation. You would admit him for stabilization, which could include IV fluids, blood transfusions if necessary, and urgent endoscopy to identify the source of bleeding and possibly treat it. You would also continue PPI therapy to reduce acid production and minimize further bleeding.

To sort these times properly, you will likely need to convert them into a 24-hour format which most databases support natively for sorting. How to convert and sort the times depends on the specific database system you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.). Below are examples for some common SQL-based databases: # MySQL: \`\`\`sql SELECT time_column, STR_TO_DATE(time_column, '%h:%i %p') AS time_converted FROM your_table ORDER BY time_converted ASC; \`\`\` Here, \`STR_TO_DATE\` converts the string to a time type with the '%h:%i %p' format specifier, converting 12-hour time into a MySQL TIME type. # PostgreSQL: \`\`\`sql SELECT time_column, TO_TIMESTAMP(time_column, 'HH12:MI AM') AS time_converted FROM your_table ORDER BY time_converted ASC; \`\`\` \`TO_TIMESTAMP\` in PostgreSQL does a similar conversion, taking the string and a format to create a timestamp. # SQLite: SQLite does not have built-in functions for converting AM/PM times. You would have to work around this, possibly by using substrings and case conversion if your times are consistently formatted, or handle the conversion in your application code. For general conversion, here's how you can convert a string to 24-hour time in Python as an example: \`\`\`python from datetime import datetime # Convert a time string to 24-hour format def convert_to_24h(timestr): return datetime.strptime(timestr, '%I:%M %p').strftime('%H:%M') times = ['06:53 am', '07:32 pm', '01:15 pm'] # Convert all times times_24h = [convert_to_24h(time) for time in times] # Sort times sorted_times = sorted(times_24h) print(sorted_times) \`\`\` In this Python code, \`%I\` stands for the hour (12-hour clock), \`%M\` for the minute, \`%p\` for AM or PM indicator, \`%H\` for the hour (24-hour clock), and \`%M\` for the minute. Please adjust your query based on the actual database system you are using. If you provide more information about your specific database system, I can give you a tailored answer."},{"prompt":"if i have in a database with data like 06:53 am,07:32 pm , how do i sort in postgresql","completion":"In PostgreSQL, you can sort times by first ensuring that the data is stored in a column of type \`TIME\` or \`TIMESTAMPTZ\`. If your data is stored as text (e.g., in a \`VARCHAR\` column) with AM/PM indicators, you would need to first cast it to a time type before sorting. If your data is indeed in a text format like '06:53 am', '07:32 pm', you would need to convert it to the \`TIME\` type using the \`TO_TIMESTAMP\` function along with the correct format specifiers, and then you can order by that. Here's an example that shows how you can do this: Assuming you have a table named \`my_table\` with a text column named \`time_text\` that has values like '06:53 am', '07:32 pm', etc., you could sort these times using the following query: \`\`\`sql SELECT time_text, TO_TIMESTAMP(time_text, 'HH12:MI AM')::TIME as converted_time -- Convert text to time FROM my_table ORDER BY converted_time; -- Order by the converted time \`\`\` This \`TO_TIMESTAMP(time_text, 'HH12:MI AM')\` function will parse the text as a timestamp according to the 'HH12:MI AM' format, which understands the 12-hour clock with AM/PM indicator. The \`::TIME\` cast will then convert the resulting timestamp into a time without a date. Remember, once you've confirmed that this works as expected for your data, you might want to consider storing the data as a proper time type (\`TIME\`) in the first place to avoid the need for conversions in your queries and to avoid potential errors with invalid or inconsistently formatted time strings."},{"prompt":"Hey","completion":"Hello!

However, I can point out a few potential improvements and ways to troubleshoot common issues: 1. **Consistent Versions for Dependencies**: Check your \`pom.xml\` for any version mismatches between related dependencies or plugins. For Spring Boot projects, it's recommended to manage dependencies using Spring Boot's dependency management which controls the versions of your dependencies. 2. **Spring Boot Starter Parent**: Consider using Spring Boot's starter parent in your \`pom.xml\`, which simplifies Maven defaults and includes dependency management for your Spring Boot projects. 3. **Matching Spring Versions**: You are using Spring Web and Spring Context version \`5.0.7.RELEASE\` along with Spring Boot Starter \`2.6.3\`. It's better to ensure that all Spring-related dependencies are compatible with each other. Typically, with Spring Boot, you do not need to specify versions for Spring modules individually. 4. **Project Lombok**: You have Lombok set to use \\"RELEASE\\" which is not a specific version. It is better to specify a specific version to ensure stable builds. For example \`<version>1.18.20</version>\`. 5. **Compiler Warnings as Errors**: The \`<compilerArgument>-Werror</compilerArgument>\` configuration item in \`maven-compiler-plugin\` treats all warnings as errors. If your build is failing due to warnings, you might need to remove this argument. 6. **Test Resource Handling**: Your excluding of \`*.java\` files inside \`testResources\` may be unnecessary unless you have a specific reason to do so. 7. **Scala Plugin for Gatling**: Make sure that you actually need the Scala plugin for Gatling. If you are just running Gatling tests without compiling Scala code, you might not need this plugin. 8. **Ensure Dependencies for Karate**: Karate dependencies are included correctly, but ensure you are using compatible versions. Based on the information above, review and ensure that your \`pom.xml\` follows best practices for Spring Boot projects and that all versions specified are correct and compatible. If you are encountering a specific problem (e.g., a build error), try to diagnose it by reading the error messages provided by Maven during the build process and adjust your configuration accordingly. If you need help with a specific error, please provide the error details."},{"prompt":"I am getting this error while running my local server

you are encountering, \`java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/core/metrics/ApplicationStartup\`, indicates that the application is trying to use a class from the Spring framework that could not be found at runtime. This is typically due to a mismatch between the versions of Spring Boot and its dependencies. The class \`org.springframework.core.metrics.ApplicationStartup\` was introduced in Spring Framework 5.3 and therefore requires at least Spring Boot 2.4, since Spring Boot 2.4 depends on Spring Framework 5.3. You mentioned in the \`pom.xml\` file that you were using Spring Boot version \`2.6.3\`, which should be compatible with \`ApplicationStartup\`. However, the \`pom.xml\` file also includes explicit dependencies on \`spring-web\` and \`spring-context\` version \`5.0.7.RELEASE\`, which predate the introduction of \`ApplicationStartup\`. To solve this issue, you should use Spring Boot's dependency management to control the versions of your Spring dependencies. Remove the explicit versions from the Spring dependencies, so that Spring Boot can manage them for you: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework</groupId> <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework</groupId> <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId> </dependency> \`\`\` You should also make sure you are inheriting from Spring Boot's parent POM or importing its BOM (Bill of Material) to manage dependency versions. For example: \`\`\`xml <parent> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId> <version>2.6.3</version> <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository --> </parent> \`\`\` OR if you're not using \`spring-boot-starter-parent\`, you can import the BOM: \`\`\`xml <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId> <version>2.6.3</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> \`\`\` By doing this, you can ensure that all your Spring components are at compatible versions without specifying individual versions for each Spring-related dependency. This should fix the \`ClassNotFoundException\`. After making changes to your \`pom.xml\`, make sure to execute \`mvn clean install\` (or \`mvn clean package\`) to rebuild the project with the correct dependencies."},{"prompt":"Why my Spring boot serviceApplication is immediately stopped after starting, I want it to listen to 8080 port","completion":"If your Spring Boot application is immediately stopping after starting without showing error messages, this usually indicates that the application does not have any long-running processes, web contexts, or listeners that would keep it running. Here are a few things to check: 1. **Web Dependency**: Ensure that you have the necessary Spring Boot web starter dependency in your \`pom.xml\` or \`build.gradle\` file, which will start an embedded servlet container (like Tomcat) to listen on port 8080 by default. For Maven, this would be: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> </dependency> \`\`\` 2. **Application Class**: Make sure that your main application class is annotated with \`@SpringBootApplication\` and contains the \`main\` method with \`SpringApplication.run()\`. \`\`\`java @SpringBootApplication public class ServiceApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(ServiceApplication.class, args); } } \`\`\` 3. **Controller**: Confirm that you have at least one Spring MVC controller or REST controller with a \`@RequestMapping\` or \`@GetMapping\` that would tell Spring Boot to start the web context. \`\`\`java @RestController public class MyController { @GetMapping(\\"/\\") public String home() { return \\"Hello, World!\\"; } } \`\`\` 4. **Application Properties**: Check for properties in \`src/main/resources/application.properties\` or \`src/main/resources/application.yml\` that could affect the server. Typically, the default port 8080 will be used unless you define otherwise. If you have a property like \`spring.main.web-application-type=none\`, it will tell Spring Boot not to start a web server.

Such discrepancies suggest that the Bible, while perhaps an invaluable moral and philosophical guide, could have been subject to human error during its composition and transmission over centuries.

This is a common performance issue in applications that use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks like ActiveRecord in Rails. The problem occurs when your code retrieves a list of records and then iteratively makes queries to the database to fetch associated records for each item in the list. This means that if you have \`N\` records, the ORM will execute \`1\` query to retrieve all the records and then another \`N\` queries to retrieve related data for each record, totaling \`N+1\` queries. In the code snippet provided, the line in question: \`\`\`ruby trips = schedules.map do |schedule| \`\`\` Suggests that for each schedule in the \`schedules\` collection, additional queries may be made to retrieve associated \`stations\` and possibly the \`route\` and \`bus_schedule\`. If there are many schedules, this could lead to a large number of database queries, which would make the application slow. To solve this issue, the commenter suggests using a self-join query that would preload the necessary associated data in a much more efficient manner, reducing the number of database queries significantly. Here is an explanation of their proposed solution: 1. A self-join is performed on the \`stations\` table, creating aliases \`s1\` and \`s2\` for departure and destination stations respectively. 2. The \`preload\` method is used to preload \`schedule\` with its associated \`route\` and \`bus_schedule\` in the same query; this prevents additional queries when accessing these associations. 3. The \`where\` clause filters the stations based on the schedule's \`departure_time\` and the \`ILIKE\` keyword which allows for case-insensitive filtering by \`%{param}%\` to match any part of the string. 4. The \`order\` clause ensures that the results are ordered by the departure time. By using the mentioned queries, it is ensured that there will only be a fixed number of database queries (in this case, \`4\`), regardless of the number of schedules in the database. This dramatic reduction in queries directly correlates with better performance, especially as the database grows in size. You should consider updating the \`index\` action to avoid fetching data in a loop and instead use optimized ActiveRecord querying methods such as \`includes\`, \`joins\`, \`preload\`, or \`eager_load\` to resolve the N+1 queries problem, though the exact implementation might need to be adjusted to fit your data model and requirements."},{"prompt":"convert to sql querry stations = Station.select(\\"s1.name departure_station, s2.name destination_station, s1.schedule_id schedule_id, s1.departure_time departure_time, s2.arrival_time arrival_time\\") .joins(\\"s1, stations s2\\") .preload(schedule: { route: :bus_schedule }) .where(\\"s1.schedule_id=s2.schedule_id and s1.name ILIKE ? and s2.name ILIKE ? and s1.arrival_time > ?\\", \\"%#{params[:departure]}%\\", \\"%#{params[:destination]}%\\", arrival_time) .order(\\"s1.arrival_time ASC\\")","completion":"To convert the ActiveRecord query to a raw SQL query, you would write something like this: \`\`\`sql SELECT s1.name AS departure_station, s2.name AS destination_station, s1.schedule_id AS schedule_id, s1.departure_time AS departure_time, s2.arrival_time AS arrival_time FROM stations s1 JOIN stations s2 ON s1.schedule_id = s2.schedule_id WHERE s1.name ILIKE '%<departure>%' AND s2.name ILIKE '%<destination>%' AND s1.arrival_time > '<arrival_time>' ORDER BY s1.arrival_time ASC; \`\`\` Please note that \`<departure>\`, \`<destination>\`, and \`<arrival_time>\` are placeholders; you should replace them with the actual parameter values from \`params[:departure]\`, \`params[:destination]\`, and the \`arrival_time\` variable you used in your ActiveRecord query. Also, the original ActiveRecord query contains a \`.preload(schedule: { route: :bus_schedule })\` clause, which helps load associated records in a Rails app to avoid N+1 queries. This doesn't translate directly to a single SQL query since preloading involves separate queries to load the related objects into memory.

In this problem, you have a set of items, each with a weight (or wight, as written in the code), volume, and value. You want to maximize the total value of items in your knapsack while not exceeding the given weight and volume capacities. Let's analyze how this code attempts to solve the problem. Class fields: - \`num\` represents the number of items. - \`volume\` represents the knapsack's maximum volume capacity. - \`capacity\` represents the knapsack's maximum weight capacity. - \`wight\` (which should be spelled \`weight\`) is an array holding the weights of the items. - \`volumes\` is an array holding the volumes of the items. - \`value\` is an array holding the values of the items. Method \`knap\`: - This is a recursive function that takes three parameters: - \`i\`: the index of the current item. - \`currentVolume\`: the current total volume of items in the knapsack. - \`currentCapacity\`: the current total weight of items in the knapsack. - The base case checks if all items have been considered. If the current weight and volume are within the limits, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns a very large negative number to represent an invalid solution. - The \`take\` variable represents the value if the current item is taken (added to the knapsack). - The \`leave\` variable represents the value if the current item is not taken. - The function returns the maximum value between taking or leaving the current item. Main method (\`public static void main\`): - It initializes the problem by calling \`knap(0, 0, 0)\`, which means that we start with the first item (index 0) and no volume or capacity has been used yet. - The result, which is the maximum reachable value given the constraints, is printed to the console. Comment: - The comment at the end of the \`main\` method says \\"it's taken elements 3 and 4 and 6,\\" suggesting the optimal solution includes items at indices 2, 3, and 5 (following 0-based indexing). Note that there is a small issue with the terminology in the code - \\"wight\\" should be replaced with \\"weight\\" for proper English, but the code will function as intended because Java simply treats \\"wight\\" as a variable name. The efficiency of this code could be improved with dynamic programming by storing already computed states to avoid redundant calculations, a technique called memoization. As written, the code uses a brute-force recursive approach, which can be computationally intensive for large numbers of items."},{"prompt":"can","completion":"Apologies, it seems like your question got cut off. Could you please provide more details or context so I can assist you accordingly?"},{"prompt":"but how is the code working, in the end it returns 0, what are the values otherwise?","completion":"Let's delve a bit deeper to understand how the provided code works. The \`knap\` method uses recursion to iterate through all possible combinations of taking and not taking each item. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code: 1. \`knap\` is called with initial parameters \`(0, 0, 0)\`, meaning we start with the first item (index \`0\`) and with both the current total volume and weight (\`currentVolume\` and \`currentCapacity\`) of items in the knapsack set to \`0\`. 2. For each item at index \`i\`, the \`knap\` function is called twice recursively: - Once including the item (\`take\`): the current item's volume and weight are added to the total and its value is included in the sum. - Once excluding the item (\`leave\`): the function is called with the next item index but without changing the total volume or weight. 3. Each recursive \`knap\` function call returns the maximum value that can be achieved whether or not the current item is included, up to and including that item. 4. The base case is when \`i == num\`, which means all items have been considered. If the total volume and weight do not exceed the knapsack's capacity at this point (\`currentVolume <= volume && currentCapacity <= capacity\`), the function returns \`0\` as there are no more items to add value. Else, it returns a very large negative number to indicate an invalid solution that exceeds the knapsack's capacity or volume. This discourages the algorithm from considering this combination as part of the optimal solution. 5. As the recursion unwinds, the maximum value from both choices (taking the current item or not) at each level is combined to determine the maximum possible value for the whole set of items. 6. The \`Math.max(take, leave)\` call makes a decision at each level whether to include the current item or not, based on which choice leads to the higher total value, and thus builds the optimal value for the knapsack. The \\"values otherwise\\" are determined by the recursive calls of the \`knap\` function. Each call calculates the best solution for a subproblem of the original problem and passes that result back up the call stack. The sum of the values of the included items constitutes the total value returned at the end. The very large negative number (\`-1000000000\`) is used to represent a solution that is not feasible, meaning the combination of items exceeds the knapsack's capacity or volume. By setting a very high penalty for these solutions, the \`Math.max(take, leave)\` call will always favor the one that stays within the limits, effectively filtering out bad combinations. For debugging or a clearer understanding, you can add print statements within the \`knap\` function to see the different combinations and return values as the recursion progresses."},{"prompt":"I have a high-power led driver board, The input voltage of this board is -12V DC, and this goes to A LM5002 switching regulator and gives +5VDC for bias and control circuitry of A LM3433; in the board, there is an SMD 10 K potentiometer to control the intensity of light LED which have about 3.3 V; I want to replace the SMD potentiometer with a DIP type and also I want to use 3 LEDs to indicate the light intensity (kind of LED bar) (low, medium, high) I don't want change any components in the board, what I have to do for this purpose?","completion":"To replace the SMD potentiometer with a DIP type and add an LED bar for intensity indication without altering the existing components on the board, you can follow these steps: 1. Identify the SMD Potentiometer Pins: - Locate the SMD potentiometer on the board and identify its three terminals: the wiper (output), and the two end terminals (typically Vcc and GND or another reference voltage). 2. Desolder the SMD Potentiometer: - Using a soldering iron and possibly solder wick/solder sucker, carefully desolder the SMD potentiometer from the board. 3. Choose a DIP Potentiometer: - Select a DIP potentiometer with the same resistance value as the SMD one you've removed. 4. Wiring the DIP Potentiometer: - Mount the DIP potentiometer in a suitable location (e.g., on the enclosure of the device or on a secondary PCB). - Solder three wires to the DIP potentiometer’s corresponding pins. - Connect the other ends of the wires to the locations where the SMD potentiometer was removed from the main board, matching the correct pins. 5. Adding Intensity Indicator LEDs: - Choose three LEDs and appropriate resistors to limit current through the LEDs. 6. Connect the LEDs in Parallel to the Potentiometer: - Each LED will be connected in parallel with the potentiometer, but you’ll use additional circuitry to ensure they light up at different intensity levels. 7. LED Intensity Control Circuit: - A simple solution could be to use comparators or operational amplifiers as voltage level detectors. However, since you don’t want to change any components on the board, you can use the voltage across the potentiometer to determine the intensity. - Design a circuit with three voltage dividers with thresholds set to correspond to the low, medium, and high intensity levels. - Connect the output of each voltage divider to the base of a transistor (e.g., NPN transistor). Each transistor controls one of the LEDs. - When the voltage controlled by the potentiometer reaches the threshold of a voltage divider, the transistor turns on, and the corresponding LED lights up. - You might need to calibrate the voltage dividers to ensure that the LEDs turn on at the desired intensity levels. 8. Soldering and Installing LEDs: - Solder the resistors to the anode or cathode of the LEDs as designed. Connect the other end to the voltage control circuit you created. - Mount the LEDs on the same enclosure as the DIP potentiometer or onto a dedicated display panel, depending on where you want the indicators to be seen. 9. Testing: - Once everything is connected, power up the board and test the potentiometer by turning it and observing the LEDs. Adjust the voltage dividers if necessary to get the correct LED response at the desired potentiometer settings. 10. Final Assembly: - Secure the DIP potentiometer and the LED indicators in their final locations making sure all connections are solid and that there is no risk of short circuits. Please note that since you do not plan to change any components on the board, you’ll have to build the LED intensity indicator circuitry separately. Depending on the exact behavior of the LED driver and control circuitry, you may need to fine-tune the LED control circuit to get the desired indication. Ensure that the LED control circuit operates within safe voltage and current levels to avoid overloading any parts of the LED driver circuit."},{"prompt":"I have a high-power led driver board, The input voltage of this board is -12V DC, and this goes to A LM5002 switching regulator and gives +5VDC for bias and control circuitry of A LM3433; in the board, there is an SMD 10 K potentiometer to control the intensity of light LED which have about 3.3 V; I want to replace the SMD potentiometer with a DIP type and also I want to use 3 LEDs to indicate the light intensity (kind of LED bar) (low, medium, high) I don’t want change any components in the board, i want to use a ATmega 32A what I have to do?","completion":"If you want to use an ATmega32A microcontroller to replace the SMD potentiometer with a DIP type and also add a 3-LED bar indicator for light intensity without changing any components on the board, here's a general outline of what you could do: **Replacing the SMD potentiometer with a DIP type:** 1. **Remove the SMD potentiometer**: Carefully desolder the SMD potentiometer from the driver board. 2. **Install a DIP potentiometer**: Choose a DIP potentiometer with the same resistance value. Solder wires to the potentiometer leads and connect them to the board where the SMD potentiometer was located, maintaining the correct wiring configuration for the Vcc, wiper, and ground terminals. **Adding 3-LED indicators using the ATmega32A:** 1. **Microcontroller setup**: Assume you have an ATmega32A and it's programmed through an AVR programmer using a language like C or C++ in an environment such as Atmel Studio or PlatformIO. 2. **Programming the ATmega32A**: Write a program where the ATmega32A reads the voltage from the wiper of the potentiometer using one of its Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) channels. 3. **Configuring the I/O ports**: Set up three of the ATmega32A's digital I/O pins as outputs to control the 3 LEDs. Ensure you're using appropriate current-limiting resistors for each LED. 4. **Creating thresholds**: In your code, define three thresholds that correspond to low, medium, and high intensity. Use the ADC value from the potentiometer to determine which LEDs should be illuminated. **Example logic in pseudocode**: \`\`\` if (ADC_value < threshold_low) { turn on LED 1 (Low); turn off others; } else if (ADC_value >= threshold_low && ADC_value < threshold_medium) { turn on LED 2 (Medium); turn off others; } else if (ADC_value >= threshold_medium) { turn on LED 3 (High); turn off others; } \`\`\` 5. **Handling the PWM signal**: The LM3433 likely expects a PWM signal as the input for intensity control. You can use one of the ATmega32A's hardware PWM outputs to generate this signal. The duty cycle of the PWM signal will determine the intensity of the light. 6. **Generating the PWM**: Use the ADC value to calculate the desired PWM duty cycle that corresponds to the position of the potentiometer. 7. **Electrical connections**: Make sure that the connections between the ATmega32A and the LEDs, as well as the driver board, are solid and isolated to avoid any shorts or damage. Use appropriate headers, connectors, or soldering to establish these. 8. **Power considerations**: You'll need to ensure that the ATmega32A is powered correctly. The ATmega32A can work with voltages from 4.5V to 5.5V, so you might take the +5V output from the LM5002 to power the ATmega32A as well. Don't forget to include decoupling capacitors close to the power pins of the microcontroller. 9. **Testing**: After you have programmed the microcontroller and set up the circuit, test the entire system to ensure that the potentiometer correctly adjusts the light intensity and that the LEDs respond as expected at each intensity level. 10. **Final assembly**: Once you've tested and confirmed everything is working correctly, finalize the assembly by securing the DIP potentiometer, the microcontroller, and the LEDs in their locations, ensuring all connections are reliable. Remember that working with power LED drivers and microcontrollers requires some knowledge of electronics and programming. If you're not comfortable with either, consider seeking assistance from someone with experience in these areas. Additionally, always triple-check your connections and ensure your code is thoroughly tested to prevent damaging your components."},{"prompt":"I want to just read the potentiometer value and determinate a range which is divided by 3 (low, Medium, High) and based on this ATmega328 lights up LEDs , I want to give a separate 5V to my ATmega; give me a detailed explanation :","completion":"Certainly! If you want to utilize an ATmega328 microcontroller to read a potentiometer value and light up three separate LEDs indicating low, medium, and high ranges of that value, you can proceed as follows. The outline provided assumes you have some basic tools like a soldering iron, wire cutter/stripper, digital multimeter, and necessary supplies like wires and heat shrink tubing, if needed: 1. **Prepare the Microcontroller Board:** - Obtain an ATmega328-based board like Arduino Uno or implement a standalone ATmega328 circuit. - If you're using a standalone setup, make sure to include an external 16 MHz crystal and two 22 pF capacitors, as well as a 10kΩ pull-up resistor on the RESET pin for proper operation. 2. **Set Up Power Supplies:** - Supply the ATmega328 board with a separate 5V power source (which could be from a USB connection if you're using an Arduino Uno, or from a 5V regulator if standalone). - Make sure to connect the ground (GND) of the ATmega328 board to the common ground of the LED driver board to ensure reference voltage levels are the same across the entire system. 3. **Connect the DIP Potentiometer:** - Make sure you have a DIP potentiometer with the same resistance value as the original SMD potentiometer. - Connect the ends of the potentiometer to +3.3V from the LED driver board (or a similar reference voltage that was originally connected to the SMD potentiometer) and GND. - Connect the wiper (the middle terminal of the potentiometer) to one of the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) pins of the ATmega328 (e.g., A0). 4. **Configure the ADC:** - Write a program using the Arduino IDE or another suitable development environment that configures the ADC to read the voltage from the potentiometer. The ADC on the ATmega328 is 10-bit, which means it can represent analog values from 0 to 1023. 5. **Determine Value Ranges:** - Divide the ADC range (0-1023) into three equal parts for your low, medium, and high ranges. \`\`\` int value = analogRead(A0); // Read the ADC value from the potentiometer int range = 1023 / 3; // Divide the full range by 3 // Low range: 0 to range-1 // Medium range: range to (range*2)-1 // High range: (range*2) to 1023 \`\`\` 6. **Set Up Indicator LEDs:** - Connect three LEDs, each with a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220Ω), to three different digital I/O pins of the ATmega328 (e.g., pins 2, 3, and 4 for low, medium, and high indicators, respectively). - Configure these I/O pins as outputs in your program. 7. **Program the LED Indicators:** - Write a program logic to light up the corresponding LED based on the ADC value. Use \`digitalWrite()\` to turn the LEDs on and off. \`\`\` if (value < range) { // Low range digitalWrite(2, HIGH); digitalWrite(3, LOW); digitalWrite(4, LOW); } else if (value >= range && value < (range*2)) { // Medium range digitalWrite(2, LOW); digitalWrite(3, HIGH); digitalWrite(4, LOW); } else { // High range digitalWrite(2, LOW); digitalWrite(3, LOW); digitalWrite(4, HIGH); } \`\`\` 8. **Upload and Test:** - Upload the code to the ATmega328 using the Arduino IDE or the development environment of your choice. - Test the setup by turning the potentiometer to its extremes and mid-position, checking whether the corresponding LED lights up appropriately. 9. **Final Assembly:** - Once the testing is complete and you're satisfied with the operation, you can finalize the assembly by mounting the potentiometer and LEDs in a suitable enclosure or panel. - Insulate all connections to prevent short circuits, use strain relief on wires where needed, and ensure the entire assembly is safely housed. This would complete your setup. The microcontroller now reads the potentiometer value, divides the input range into three equal parts, and indicates the intensity by lighting up the corresponding LED for low, medium, or high intensity."},{"prompt":"take in mind, I am using a AVR ATmega and not a Arduino","completion":"Understood. If you are working directly with an AVR ATmega328 microcontroller, not an Arduino board, the approach will be more focused on low-level programming using either assembly language or C/C++ with a tool like Atmel Studio or AVR-GCC. Here's an outline for using a stand-alone ATmega328 and connecting it to your LED driver board with separate indicators for low, medium, and high intensity as indicated by your potentiometer. 1. **Circuit Assembly:** First, ensure the standalone ATmega328 is correctly set up with the necessary external components: - An external 16 MHz crystal oscillator with two 22pF capacitors. - A 10kΩ pull-up resistor on the RESET pin. - Decoupling capacitors (e.g., 100nF) near the VCC-GND pins of the ATmega. - Program the ATmega328 with an AVR ISP programmer or similar tool. - Connect your DIP potentiometer's ends to +3.3V and GND, and the wiper to an ADC pin, such as ADC0 (PC0/pin 23). 2. **Power Supply:** - Use a stable 5V power supply for the ATmega328, connected to VCC and GND pins (pins 7 and 8, and 20 and 22) along with decoupling capacitors. - Share a common ground between ATmega328 board and LED driver board. 3. **LEDs Connection:** - Connect the cathodes of three indicator LEDs through appropriate current-limiting resistors to three different I/O pins on the ATmega328 (e.g., PD2, PD3, and PD4). The anodes of the LEDs go to the positive side of your 5V supply. 4. **Programming:** - Use Atmel Studio and an AVR ISP programmer or other tools capable of programming AVR chips to write your C/C++ program. - Use the AVR libraries to access the ADC and I/O registers. - Program the ATmega328 to initialize the ADC subsystem for the voltage range you are dealing with and set up the I/O pins as outputs. 5. **Program Logic:** The logic in your program will be similar to the pseudocode previously discussed, but it must be implemented in C/C++ with the correct functions for interacting with AVR hardware. Here is a very simplified version of what the C code might look like: \`\`\`c #include <avr/io.h> #define LED_LOW PD2 #define LED_MEDIUM PD3 #define LED_HIGH PD4 #define ADC_CHANNEL 0 void initADC() { ADMUX |= (1 << REFS0); // AVCC with external capacitor at AREF pin ADCSRA |= (1 << ADEN) | (1 << ADPS1) | (1 << ADPS0); // Enable ADC and prescaler of 8 } uint16_t readADC(uint8_t channel) { ADMUX = (ADMUX & 0xF8) | (channel & 0x07); // Select ADC channel ADCSRA |= (1 << ADSC); // Start conversion while (ADCSRA & (1 << ADSC)); // Wait until conversion is completed return (ADC); } void setup() { DDRD |= (1 << LED_LOW) | (1 << LED_MEDIUM) | (1 << LED_HIGH); // Set LED pins as outputs initADC(); // Initialize ADC } void loop() { uint16_t adcResult = readADC(ADC_CHANNEL); uint16_t range = 1024 / 3; // Divide the full range by 3 if (adcResult < range) { PORTD = (1 << LED_LOW); } else if (adcResult < range * 2) { PORTD = (1 << LED_MEDIUM); } else { PORTD = (1 << LED_HIGH); } } int main(void) { setup(); while(1) { loop(); } return 0; } \`\`\` 6. **Uploading the Code:** - Use an ISP programmer with Atmel Studio to upload the compiled program to the ATmega328. 7. **Testing and Final Assembly:** - With the program uploaded, apply power to your system and rotate the potentiometer. Observe that the LEDs light up corresponding to the low, medium, and high levels. Adjust your divisor for the range thresholds as necessary based on the accuracy of the potentiometer and the desired behavior. - Secure all components into a final enclosure if necessary and ensure all connections are well-insulated and secured. This procedure uses fundamental microcontroller programming and standard electronic practices to accomplish your task. The details above provide a general outline and may need to be adapted based on your specific context, your familiarity with electronics and programming, and the particular specifications of your existing LED driver board and the broader system."},{"prompt":"i have a Arduino uno , with a heavy duty LED board in the LED there is a 10 K ohm Potentiometer , I change the SMD potentiometer with a 10 k dip , I want to use Pin A5 of my arduino to read the potentiometer value , which is between 65 Ohm to 337 Ohm and gnd of potentiometer is connected to gnd of my arduino , and base this values I want to light up 3 leds to indicate the potentiometer value as low, mid and high( consider this i want to light up this 3 leds with my arduino) write me a code for this job","completion":"Sure, I will provide you with a sample Arduino sketch that reads the potentiometer value from pin A5 and lights up three different LEDs connected to the Arduino Uno to indicate low, mid, and high values.

We determine which LED should be lit by comparing the mapped value to predefined thresholds (these values are approximately one-third and two-thirds of the maximum ADC value, which is 1023). The LEDs are then activated accordingly. The \`delay(100)\` at the end of the \`loop()\` helps to reduce the flickering of LEDs during state changes.

The ATmega32A has different pin assignments and specifications compared to the ATmega328P used on the Arduino Uno. Here are the steps to use an ATmega32A for the same task: # 1. Hardware Setup - Ensure that the ATmega32A is provided with a stable power source. You can use a 5V voltage regulator like the LM7805. - The microcontroller will need a clock source; choose between using the internal oscillator or installing an external crystal oscillator (and related capacitors) if more accuracy is required. - Connect the wiper of the potentiometer to one of the ADC-compatible pins of the ATmega32A. For example, you can use Pin 40 (PA0) for the ADC0 channel. - Connect your LEDs (with current-limiting resistors) to appropriate I/O pins on the ATmega32A. Remember to configure these pins as output in your code. - Provide for programming the ATmega32A using an ISP (In-System Programmer). You will need to connect the ISP to the MISO, MOSI, SCK, RESET, VCC, and GND pins of the ATmega32A for programming. Pinout diagrams are widely available online. # 2. Software Setup and Programming - Install and set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports AVR programming, like Atmel Studio, Microchip Studio, or use the AVR toolchain with a text editor. - Set up the fuses on the ATmega32A using your ISP. Fuses are configuration bits that set things like the clock source, clock speed prescalers, and other important startup configurations. # 3. Write the C Code Your code will need to be adjusted for the ATmega32A's registers and peripherals. Here’s an abbreviated version of what the main loop of the code might look like (you'll still need to set up the I/O and ADC in your \`main()\` function and you'll need to implement \`initADC()\`, \`readADC()\`, and \`initLEDs()\` functions): \`\`\`c #include <avr/io.h> #define LED_LOW PD2 #define LED_MEDIUM PD3 #define LED_HIGH PD4 #define ADC_CHANNEL 0 int main(void) { // Setup I/O, ADC, and any other necessary peripherals initLEDs(); initADC(); while(1) { uint16_t adcResult = readADC(ADC_CHANNEL); // Map and threshold values may need to be adjusted for the ATmega32A ADC reference uint16_t range = 1024 / 3; // Turn all LEDs off initially PORTD &= ~((1 << LED_LOW) | (1 << LED_MEDIUM) | (1 << LED_HIGH)); // Determine which LEDs to light up based on the adcResult if(adcResult >= range * 2) { // High PORTD |= ((1 << LED_LOW) | (1 << LED_MEDIUM) | (1 << LED_HIGH)); } else if(adcResult >= range) { // Medium PORTD |= ((1 << LED_LOW) | (1 << LED_MEDIUM)); } else { // Low PORTD |= (1 << LED_LOW); } _delay_ms(100); // Include <util/delay.h> to use this function } } \`\`\` # 4. Compile and Upload - Compile your C code into a hex file that can be uploaded to the ATmega32A microcontroller. - Use the ISP and your IDE or programming software to upload the compiled code to the ATmega32A. # 5. Testing - After programming the ATmega32A, without the programmer connected, apply power to your board. - Adjust the potentiometer and observe whether the LEDs respond as expected. # 6. Debugging and Final Assembly - If the LEDs do not behave as expected, use debugging tools provided by your IDE or simple debugging techniques (like toggling spare I/O pins that can be probed with a multimeter or scope). - Once everything works correctly, finalize your hardware. You might want a PCB or a permanent breadboard setup. **Note**: Ensure you reference the ATmega32A datasheet and AVR-libc documentation for accurate register names, bit values, and peripherals usage. The above example is meant to give you a starting point, and will require completion and adaptation for the ATmega32A.

Исходя из этого утверждения и учитывая состояние переводов медицинских текстов за этот период, несложно прийти к другому выводу: зарождение компиляции русской медицинской терминологии началось в период Киевской Руси. Однако с середины XIII века, вследствие вторжения монголо-татар и последующего более чем 200-летнего правления над Россией, русская медицина практически остановилась в развитии, а компиляция медицинских терминов впала в застой.

Эти заметки можно считать прототипами словарей. В период Киевской Руси аналогичные практики наблюдались в переводном религиозном и медицинском литературном наследии, где встречалось обилие сложной терминологии с толкованиями, объяснениями понятий, а также табличными сопоставлениями слов древнеславянского и древнерусского языков. Эти методы систематизации и разъяснения языка легли в основу словарного дела. Исследователи истории русской лексикографии на основании подобных материалов пришли к выводу о том, что именно в XI веке на территории Руси началась работа по созданию словарей. Такой подход позволяет предположить, что развитие русской медицинской терминологии также берёт своё начало во времена Киевской Руси. Однако с середины XIII века, в результате монголо-татарского нашествия и последующего длительного периода их господства, прогресс в области русской медицины значительно замедлился, и это отразилось на процессе сбора и систематизации медицинских терминов, который фактически застопорился.

In this whole setup: - \`BusSchedule\`, \`Route\`, \`Schedule\`, and \`Station\` are like different sections of your list on that big board. - Each has connections to the other, like how trains connect different stations. Here's what the code is doing: 1. We get the names of the departure and destination stations from somewhere else (like a user typing them in), and we make sure they are in uppercase letters and have spaces instead of underscores. 2. We check if they've given us a specific time they want to leave after, and if they don't want to see return trips (like a trip from your destination back to your starting point). 3. Now the SQL query magic happens. We look for schedules that: - Include both departure and destination stations. It's similar to scanning through all train schedules on the big board for those that list your starting and ending points. - Also, have any station starting with the station name you're looking for (like how you might have more than one bus stop with a similar name). To do this, we join the \`Station\` section of our list with the \`Schedule\` section to see all the stops along with the schedule. 4. We use a special SQL query (\`LIKE\`) to find station names that are exactly the same as what you're looking for or start with those names (like \\"PALA %\\"). 5. Once we find the schedules that match the stations, we make sure they only have those two unique stations to avoid mix-ups. 6. After that, we look through each schedule to check a few things: - We find the exact location (index) of your departure and destination stations in the list of stations for each schedule. - We make sure the departure station comes before the destination station in the list (so we're not looking at a return trip). 7. If we have a time provided, we skip over any schedules where the departure would be before that time. 8. Then we gather all the data about your trip from these schedules, like the bus number, the trip identifier, and the station details (name, arrival, and departure times). 9. If you said you don't want to see return trips, we only keep the part of the station list from your departure to your destination. 10. Lastly, we sort all the trips we've found by the departure time at your starting station, so you can see which one leaves first. Then, we’re done! We show you all the scheduled trips we found that match your criteria, all sorted and ready to go, just like having a personalized timetable just for you. And that's pretty much how the SQL query in this controller action works. It carefully searches through all the information in our database to find exactly what you're looking for, just like a super-smart train conductor finding your perfect train trip on that giant schedule board."},{"prompt":"can you improve a script?","completion":"Yes, I can certainly help you improve a script.

Below are some improvements and best practices to consider implementing: 1. **Check for Az Module**: Before executing the main script, check if the 'Az' module is installed and import it. This helps prevent errors if the module is missing or not imported. 2. **Error Handling**: Expand the error handling to capture more specific exceptions and ensure proper cleanup if part of the process fails. 3. **Logging**: Implement a logging mechanism to capture the steps and any potential errors. 4. **Validation checks**: Add checks to ensure that the VM exists and is in the expected state before attempting operations. 5. **Parameterizing Script**: Convert repeated values and hardcoded strings into parameters or variables at the start of the script, making it easy to reuse and configure. 6. **Idempotency**: Ensure that running the script multiple times doesn't lead to unexpected behaviour or duplicated resources. 7. **Resource Cleanup**: Confirm that any temporary resources such as snapshots are cleaned up in the event of both success and failure.

Flagstaff has an equity cost of capital of 13%, a debt cost of capital of 7%, and it is in the 35% corporate tax bracket. a. If Flagstaff currently maintains a .5 debt to equity ratio, what is the value of Flagstaff? (5 points) b. If Flagstaff currently maintains a .5 debt to equity ratio, what is the value of Flagstaff's interest tax shield?","completion":"To calculate the value of Flagstaff Enterprises and the value of the interest tax shield, we need to use the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) approach and account for the tax benefits of debt. a. Calculate the value of Flagstaff Firstly, we must calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) accounting for the debt to equity ratio and the tax shield. Given a debt to equity ratio (D/E) of 0.5, we can express the proportions of debt and equity financing as a fraction of the total value of the firm (V). Let D represent the value of debt and E represent the value of equity. [ frac{D}{E} = 0.5 ] Now, let's say the value of equity is 1; then, the value of debt would be 0.5. The total value of the firm would be 1 (equity) + 0.5 (debt) = 1.5. [ E = 1, D = 0.5, V = E + D = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 ] Now, to find the WACC: [ WACC = E/V cdot Re + D/V cdot Rd cdot (1 - Tc) ] where: - ( E/V ) is the proportion of equity financing - ( Re ) is the cost of equity, which is 13% - ( D/V ) is the proportion of debt financing - ( Rd ) is the cost of debt, which is 7% - ( Tc ) is the corporate tax rate, which is 35% [ WACC = frac{1}{1.5} cdot 0.13 + frac{0.5}{1.5} cdot 0.07 cdot (1 - 0.35) ] [ WACC = frac{1}{1.5} cdot 0.13 + frac{0.5}{1.5} cdot 0.07 cdot 0.65 ] [ WACC = frac{2}{3} cdot 0.13 + frac{1}{3} cdot 0.07 cdot 0.65 ] [ WACC = 0.0867 + 0.0152 ] [ WACC = 0.1019 text{ or } 10.19% ] To find the value of Flagstaff (V), we use the Gordon Growth Model (also known as the Perpetuity Growth Model), given that the free cash flow is expected to grow at a constant rate: [ V = frac{FCFF_1}{WACC - g} ] where: - ( FCFF_1 ) is the free cash flow for the next year, which is 8 million - ( WACC ) is the weighted average cost of capital (~10.19%) - ( g ) is the growth rate of the free cash flow, which is 3% [ V = frac{8 text{ million}}{0.1019 - 0.03} ] [ V = frac{8 text{ million}}{0.0719} ] [ V = 111.26453 text{ million or approximately } 111.26 text{ million} ] That's the total value of the firm, including both debt and equity. b. Calculate the value of Flagstaff's interest tax shield The interest tax shield is the present value of future tax savings due to interest payments. Since Flagstaff maintains a 0.5 debt to equity ratio and the cost of debt is 7%, we can calculate the annual interest expense using the total debt (D). Interest expense annually is ( D cdot Rd ): [ Interest text{ } Expense = 0.5 cdot E cdot 0.07 ] However, because we defined E as 1 for simplicity, the value of D being 0.5 remains: [ Interest text{ } Expense = 0.5 cdot 0.07 ] Now, the annual tax saving due to interest expense is: [ Tax text{ } Saving = Interest text{ } Expense cdot Tc ] [ Tax text{ } Saving = 0.5 cdot 0.07 cdot 0.35 ] [ Tax text{ } Saving = 0.01225 ] This 0.01225 represents the annual tax saving for each dollar of equity. To find the present value of the interest tax shield, we treat it as a perpetuity growing at the same growth rate as the free cash flow, since debt is assumed to be constant in proportion to the growing firm's value: [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = frac{Tax text{ } Saving cdot E}{WACC - g} ] [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = frac{0.01225 cdot E}{WACC - g} ] Considering we treated E as 1 to simplify calculations: [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = frac{0.01225}{0.1019 - 0.03} ] [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = frac{0.01225}{0.0719} ] [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = 0.17037608 text{ or approximately } 0.17 text{ per dollar of equity} ] Since we considered equity to be 1, the value of the interest tax shield would also be 0.17 times the actual value of equity in the firm. Given our earlier calculation: The proportion of equity in the firm's total value is: [ frac{E}{V} = frac{1}{1.5} ] [ E = V cdot frac{1}{1.5} ] [ E = 111.26 text{ million} cdot frac{2}{3} ] [ E approx 74.17 text{ million} ] Therefore, the value of the interest tax shield is: [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = 0.17 cdot 74.17 text{ million} ] [ Value text{ } of text{ } Interest text{ } Tax text{ } Shield = 12.6089 text{ million or approximately } 12.61 text{ million} ] So, Flagstaff's interest tax shield is valued at approximately 12.61 million.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you should follow to achieve this: 1. **Data Preparation**: First, you need to prepare your dataset. This involves collecting all your documents and converting them into a format that can be fed into the machine learning model. Text should be extracted from each document, which may require OCR (Optical Character Recognition) if they're scanned images, or text parsing if they're in a digital format such as PDF or Word. 2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing irrelevant items (like headers, footers, pagination), correcting typos, and possibly performing tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization. 3. **Model Customization or Training**: - If you have not yet developed \\"llama2,\\" you'd need to create or choose a suitable language model architecture (like BERT, GPT, etc.) and train it on a dataset relevant to your domain of circular notices. - If \\"llama2\\" is a pre-existing model that you've either found or been provided with, you should customize or fine-tune it using your specific dataset. 4. **Integration and Inference**: - Once the model is ready, you need to integrate it into a system or pipeline that feeds the preprocessed documents into the model and retrieves the model's output. - Create a script or a service that can process batches of documents, run them through the model, and output the relevant information or classifications. 5. **Post-processing**: The raw output from the model may need to be formatted or further analyzed to provide actionable insights or to fit the desired output format. 6. **Performance Checking and Iteration**: Run your model on a test set of documents to check its performance. You may need to iterate on steps 3 through 5 to improve accuracy and reliability. 7. **Deployment**: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy the document processing pipeline to a production environment, where your documents will be processed by the model. When implementing the technical aspects of such a project, here are the typical components and tools you might use: - **OCR Tools**: Tesseract, ABBYY FineReader, or similar for extracting text from images. - **NLP Libraries**: Libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face's Transformers for text preprocessing and model interactions. - **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, or similar, if you're building or fine-tuning models. - **Computational Resources**: Depending on the size of your model and dataset, GPU or TPU resources may be needed for efficient model training and inference. - **Storage and Databases**: For managing the large amounts of documents and processed results. - **APIs and Services**: To make your model accessible to other systems or services. - **Monitoring and Logging**: To keep track of the system's performance and any potential issues. Keep in mind that when creating or using any machine learning models, it's important to consider the legal and privacy implications, especially when processing potentially sensitive documents. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and that your system is compliant with relevant data protection laws (such as GDPR)."},{"prompt":"any example please","completion":"Certainly! I'll walk you through a hypothetical example using Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library to process circular notices with a custom language model. For this example, let's assume you are performing a text classification task to categorize the notices into several predefined classes. # Example Steps for Processing Documents: 1. **Install Necessary Libraries** First, you need to install all the necessary libraries, such as \`transformers\` for the model and \`pandas\` for handling the data. \`\`\`bash pip install transformers pandas \`\`\` 2. **Prepare the Data** Let’s say you have your text data extracted and saved in a CSV file called \`notices.csv\` with a column \`text\` that contains the content of each notice. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Load the data from the CSV file df = pd.read_csv('notices.csv') texts = df['text'].tolist() # Convert the text column to a list \`\`\` 3. **Preprocess the Data** Text data might need some basic preprocessing. This can vary based on the data and the model. For example, some models require you to add special tokens or to truncate the text. \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer # Load the tokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('your-model') # Preprocessing the texts encoded_texts = [tokenizer(text, truncation=True, padding='max_length', max_length=512) for text in texts] \`\`\` 4. **Load the Custom Model** Assuming you've already trained your model, you need to load it. If it's a Hugging Face model you could load it as follows: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification # Load the model model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('your-model') # Assuming a simple function to get predictions from the model def get_predictions(encoded_texts): # Here you'd normally have your model inference code pass \`\`\` 5. **Classify the Notices** Use your custom model to classify each of these texts. \`\`\`python # Get predictions for all texts results = get_predictions(encoded_texts) # Assume you are adding the results back into the DataFrame df['category'] = results # Save the classified data back to CSV if needed df.to_csv('classified_notices.csv', index=False) \`\`\` 6. **System Integration** You would likely have the model wrapped in a function or an API endpoint that your system can call. \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, request, jsonify app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/classify', methods=['POST']) def classify_text(): text = request.json.get(\\"text\\", \\"\\") encoded_text = tokenizer(text, truncation=True, padding='max_length', max_length=512) prediction = get_predictions([encoded_text]) return jsonify({'category': prediction}) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run() \`\`\` This would allow you to send a POST request with the document content and receive the category as a response, which can be incorporated into your application as needed. # Note: - Replace \`'your-model'\` with the actual path or name of your custom-trained model. - \`get_predictions\` is a placeholder for your actual prediction function. You would have to write the logic to feed the encoded tokens into your model and interpret the output. - The Flask app is a simple example of how you might set up an API. For production, you would need to consider scalability, security, error handling, and other issues. - This is a simplification. Real-world processing can be much more complex and require extensive error handling, scaling via queues or distributed systems like Kubernetes, and potentially much more preprocessing (e.g., handling various file formats, multipage documents, etc.). Your actual use case might require different preprocessing, a different kind of model, and a more complex system architecture, but the general flow would be similar to what I’ve outlined here."},{"prompt":"suggest a movies site free","completion":"I'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I cannot assist with locating or promoting the use of websites that provide copyrighted content illegally.

Here, I'll guide you through the process flow, starting from data preparation to model deployment. # 1. Planning Your Model and Understanding Requirements: Before you start, clearly understand what you want your chatbot to do - will it answer questions about the text in the PDFs, summarize content, or extract specific information? # 2. Preprocessing Steps: Extract Text from PDFs: - Use a library like \`PyMuPDF\` or \`pdfminer.six\` to read and extract text from PDF files. Data Cleaning: - Remove headers, footers, and other non-essential sections. - Strip out any unwanted characters or spaces. Tokenization: - Use an NLP library to chunk text into words, phrases, or semantic units. Data Structuring: - Format the extracted data in a way your machine learning model will expect (e.g., CSV or JSON). # 3. Dataset Creation: For Training a Model: - If you are creating a dataset for machine learning, collect a large number of PDF documents relevant to your chatbot’s domain. - Label the data as necessary for your task (e.g., extract and label specific information for a named entity recognition model). For Inference: - For the purpose of simply running PDFs through an existing model to extract insights, your dataset might simply be those PDFs. # 4. Choose a Model: - If your task is more general, you can use pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-3, etc. - For more specialized tasks, you may need to fine-tune a pre-trained model or train your model from scratch using your labeled dataset. # 5. Training the Model: Libraries and Frameworks: - Use libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers for easy access to pre-trained models and training capabilities. - Use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to construct, train, and evaluate your models if building from scratch. Training Process: - Preprocess and tokenize your dataset. - Split your data into training, validation, and test sets. - Set up your model, loss functions, optimizers, and other hyperparameters. - Train the model by feeding the training data and adjusting weights based on the error (loss). - Regularly evaluate the model on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. # 6. Evaluation: - Use performance metrics relevant to your task (accuracy, F1 score, BLEU, etc.) on the test set to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. # 7. Testing and User Interaction: Implementation: - Implement a conversation loop where the chatbot can receive input, process it, and return responses. - Integrate PDF reading and insight extraction capabilities into the chat loop, so the chatbot can handle both conversational and document-related queries. Chatbot Frameworks and Platforms: - Use platforms like Botpress, Rasa, or Microsoft Bot Framework to build the conversational aspects. - Integrate your language model within these platforms to add AI capabilities. # 8. Deployment: - Deploy your chatbot on servers or cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, or Heroku). - Ensure that it can scale to multiple users and handle concurrent conversations. # Monitoring and Maintenance: - Regularly monitor the performance of your chatbot. - Collect user feedback and logs to improve and retrain the model as needed. Make sure that at all stages, you comply with any relevant data privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA, especially when dealing with personal data. Having a thorough understanding of these aspects before you delve into the technical part can save you a great deal of time and ensure your project's success."},{"prompt":"thats nice please provide starter pack atleast like preprocess code training and evaluation code every mentioned steps with their code snippets please","completion":"Certainly!

Here is an amended version of the fourth union that resolves the column ambiguity by using aliases for the joined DataFrames: \`\`\`python from pyspark.sql.functions import col # Alias DataFrames to remove ambiguity v5pf_aliased = v5pf.alias('v5') d4pf_temp_aliased = v5pf_d4pf_temp_tbl.alias('d4') d5pf_temp_aliased = v5pf_d5pf_temp_tbl.alias('d5') fourth_union = ( v5pf_aliased.join(eod_vw, col('v5.eod_date') == eod_vw.eod_date) .join( d4pf_temp_aliased, (col('d4.v5brnm') == col('v5.v5brnm')) & (col('d4.v5dlp') == col('v5.v5dlp')) & (col('d4.v5dlr') == col('v5.v5dlr')), \\"left_outer\\" ) .join( d5pf_temp_aliased, (col('d5.v5brnm') == col('v5.v5brnm')) & (col('d5.v5dlp') == col('v5.v5dlp')) & (col('d5.v5dlr') == col('v5.v5dlr')), \\"left_outer\\" ) .withColumn(\\"eff_date\\", to_timestamp(format_otsdte_udf(col('d4.otsdte')), \\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\\")) .where((col('v5.v5peg') == \\"Y\\") & (col('v5.v5rat') == 0)) .select( col('v5.v5brnm'), col('v5.v5dlp'), col('v5.v5dlr'), when(col('v5.v5tdt') == \\"L\\", (coalesce(col('d4.d4brar'), lit(0)) + coalesce(col('d5.d5drar'), lit(0)) + coalesce(col('v5.v5rtm'), lit(0))) ).when(col('v5.v5tdt') == \\"D\\", (coalesce(col('d4.d4brar'), lit(0)) - coalesce(col('d5.d5drar'), lit(0)) - coalesce(col('v5.v5rtm'), lit(0))) ).alias(\\"effective_rate\\"), \\"eff_date\\" ) ) # Now, you can union this with the other DataFrames/result sets as needed. \`\`\` Before you union the DataFrames, make sure that the columns you're selecting have the same names and data types across all the DataFrames that are being unioned. This way, you avoid schema inconsistencies. After applying aliases, remember to use these aliases consistently throughout your transformations to tell Spark exactly which column you are referring to. The \`.alias()\` method attaches the specified alias to the DataFrame which helps when you have multiple columns with the same name after joins."},{"prompt":"null in eff_date correct it asap","completion":"The error associated with the \`eff_date\` field being \`null\` might be due to the processing logic inside the \`format_otsdte_udf\` user-defined function (UDF), the input data, or the way it is applied.

If Flagstaff currently maintains a .5 debt to equity ratio, what is the value of Flagstaff's interest tax shield? (200 words)","completion":"a. To determine the value of Flagstaff Enterprises, we need to calculate the present value of all future free cash flows (FCFs) using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account the cost of equity, the cost of debt, and the tax advantage of debt (interest tax shield). First, let's calculate the WACC: Equity proportion (E/V) = Equity / (Equity + Debt) = 1 / (1 + D/E) = 1 / (1 + 0.5) = 2/3 Debt proportion (D/V) = Debt / (Equity + Debt) = D/E / (1 + D/E) = 0.5 / (1 + 0.5) = 1/3 Cost of equity is given as 13% or 0.13, and the after-tax cost of debt is the cost of debt adjusted for the tax shield: (1 - Tax Rate) * Debt Cost of Capital = (1 - 0.35) * 0.07 = 0.0455. WACC = (E/V) * Equity Cost + (D/V) * After-tax Debt Cost WACC = (2/3) * 0.13 + (1/3) * 0.0455 WACC ≈ 0.086667 + 0.015167 WACC ≈ 0.101834 or approximately 10.1834% Now we can value the company using the Gordon Growth Model for the perpetuity growth of free cash flows: Value of the Firm (V0) = FCF1 / (WACC - g) where FCF1 is the free cash flow in the coming year and g is the growth rate V0 = 8 million / (0.101834 - 0.03) V0 ≈ 8 million / 0.071834 V0 ≈ 111.388 million The value of Flagstaff Enterprises is approximately 111.388 million. b. The interest tax shield is the reduction in income taxes that results from the interest deductible expense. To calculate the interest tax shield's present value, we need the net interest expense (which we don't have directly so we need to deduce it) and the perpetual growth model. If the firm maintains a 0.5 debt to equity ratio, the value of debt (D) is half the value of equity (E). Using the same formula from above to calculate the value of the firm (V = D + E), we can deduce the following: Debt (D) = 0.5 * Equity (E) Now, if we have the value of the firm (V0) from part a, the Equity (E) can be expressed as: E = V0 / (1 + D/E) = 111.388 million / (1 + 0.5) = 111.388 million / 1.5 ≈ 74.259 million Debt (D) = 0.5 * E = 0.5 * 74.259 million ≈ 37.129 million Now we need the interest rate on the debt to calculate the interest tax shield. Assuming it is the debt cost of capital of 7%, the annual interest expense would be: Interest Expense = D * Debt Cost of Capital Interest Expense = 37.129 million * 0.07 ≈ 2.599 million The present value of the interest tax shield (PVTS) can be estimated using the perpetual growth model: PVTS = Tax Rate * Interest Expense / WACC PVTS = 0.35 * 2.599 million / 0.101834 PVTS ≈ 0.909 million / 0.101834 PVTS ≈ 8.927 million The value of Flagstaff's interest tax shield is approximately 8.927 million."},{"prompt":"How to decrypt sha256 in python","completion":"SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function from the SHA-2 family and, like all cryptographic hash functions, it is designed to be a one-way function, effectively impossible to reverse. A hash function takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, the hash value, is often called the message digest or simply the digest. The design of SHA-256 means it is infeasible to reverse the hash function to retrieve the original input data. The only method to \\"decrypt\\" a hash (which is a misnomer since hashing is not encryption) is to perform a brute force attack or use a rainbow table, which involves comparing the hash with the hash values of known inputs. However, for SHA-256, the immense number of possible inputs makes brute force attacks and rainbow tables impractical. If you have the need to check if a given input hashes to a certain SHA-256 hash, you can do so in Python using the hashlib library. Here's how to hash an input with SHA-256 and how to compare it to a given hash: \`\`\`python import hashlib # Your input data input_data = \\"secret_data\\" # The SHA-256 hash you want to compare against known_hash = \\"your_known_hash_here\\" # Encoding the input data and hashing it with SHA-256 hash_object = hashlib.sha256(input_data.encode()) resulting_hash = hash_object.hexdigest() # Comparing the hash of the input data with the known hash if resulting_hash == known_hash: print(\\"The input data matches the known hash!\\") else: print(\\"The input data does NOT match the known hash.\\") \`\`\` If you're trying to verify a password or other sensitive data, you'd use a secure password hashing function that includes a salt (to protect against rainbow table attacks) and multiple iterations of hashing (to slow down brute force attacks), such as bcrypt or Argon2. To be clear, cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 are designed so that they are not \\"decryptable\\". The intended use for these functions is to provide a way to check integrity or authenticity of data without the need to revert back to the original message."},{"prompt":"how to pass openai api key in header securely","completion":"Passing the OpenAI API key in the header of an HTTP request is necessary for authenticating your requests to the OpenAI API. However, you want to ensure that the key is handled securely to prevent unauthorized access. Below are some best practices for passing the OpenAI API key in headers securely: 1. **Use Environment Variables:** Do not hardcode your API key in your Python scripts. Instead, store it in an environment variable which you can then reference within your code. To set an environment variable: \`\`\`bash export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here' \`\`\` To use it in Python: \`\`\`python import os import requests api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') headers = { \\"Authorization\\": f\\"Bearer {api_key}\\" } # Use headers in your request to the OpenAI API \`\`\` 2. **Use HTTPS:** Always make sure that the requests to the API are sent over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Most HTTP client libraries default to HTTPS when given a URL that begins with \`https://\`. 3. **Keep the Key Secret:** Do not share your API key with anyone and do not embed it in client-side code such as JavaScript running in a browser. API keys should only be used in server-to-server communications or from a secure environment where the public does not have the ability to inspect the source code. 4. **Limit Permissions:** If possible, use an API key that has the minimum required permissions for the task at hand to limit the damage if the key is ever exposed. 5. **Regenerate API Keys:** If you suspect the API key is compromised, regenerate it immediately. OpenAI allows you to regenerate API keys, invalidating the old key. 6. **Monitoring and Auditing:** Regularly monitor the use of the API key to detect any unusual activity. OpenAI provides usage information that can help you spot unauthorized use. When handling sensitive data such as API keys, it is crucial to follow these security best practices combined with the general security measures that apply to the application and the infrastructure it runs in."},{"prompt":"How to secure API_KEY receiving in https header get request in python.","completion":"Securing an API key that is received in an HTTP header of a GET request requires both secure transfer and proper handling on the server side.

Q: What are the most common causes of peptic ulcers? **Peptic Ulcer Causes:** - **H. pylori Infection:** Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a leading cause of peptic ulcers. - **Chronic NSAID Use:** The chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a common contributor to peptic ulcer development. - **Additional Contributing Factors:** - **Smoking:** Tobacco smoking is identified as a contributing factor to peptic ulcers. - **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:** Consuming alcohol excessively can contribute to the development of peptic ulcers. - **Severe Stress:** Stress due to illnesses, especially severe stress, is considered a factor in peptic ulcer formation. - **Certain Medications:** The use of specific medications such as steroids or anticancer drugs may also contribute to peptic ulcers. - 2. Q: Differentiate between a gastric and a duodenal ulcer. - **Gastric Ulcer:** - Located on the lining of the stomach. - Associated with widespread inflammation of the gastric mucosa. - Occasional association with gastric cancer. - Pain worsens after eating. - **Duodenal Ulcer:** - Found in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). - Rarely associated with cancer. - More common than gastric ulcers. - Pain improves with eating or antacids but returns 2-3 hours later. - Pain more pronounced when the stomach is empty, especially at night. - 3. Q: What is the role of H. pylori in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers? - **Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Pathogenic Mechanisms:** 1. **Urease Production:** - Enzyme that converts urea into ammonia and bicarbonate. - Neutralizes the acidic stomach environment. 2. **Induction of Inflammation:** - Elicits an immune response. - Leads to damage of the mucosal lining. - Weakens the stomach’s defense mechanisms. 3. **Release of Toxins and Enzymes:** - Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA). - Directly damages epithelial cells. 4. **Regulation of Acid Secretion:** - Alters the regulation of acid secretion. - Contributes to an acidic environment harmful to the mucosal lining. - **Consequences:** - Creates an environment conducive to mucosal damage and ulcer formation. - Associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer as a long-term complication of chronic infection. - 4. Q: Name three less common causes of peptic ulcers. - **Less Common Causes of Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** - Rare condition with tumors (gastrinomas) in the pancreas or upper small intestine. - Tumors secrete excess gastrin, causing increased stomach acid production. - Results in recurrent and challenging-to-heal ulcers. 2. **Other Medications:** - Besides NSAIDs, medications like steroids, SSRIs, potassium supplements, and bisphosphonates. - High doses or prolonged use can contribute to peptic ulcer development. 3. **Lifestyle Factors:** - Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. - Increase stomach acid production and reduce the protective mucous lining, making the stomach more susceptible to ulcers. 4. **Medical Conditions:** - Severe physiologic stress from medical conditions. - Shock, severe burns (Curling’s ulcer), intracranial injury (Cushing’s ulcer), or critical illness can lead to stress ulcers. 5. **Genetic Factors:** - Genetic predisposition in some individuals. - Increased risk for developing peptic ulcers. 6. **Viral infections:** - In very rare cases, viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), can cause ulcers, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. - 5. Q: What is Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and how does it relate to peptic ulcer disease? - **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES):** - Rare disorder characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas). - Tumors typically in the pancreas or upper small intestine (duodenum). - Results in excessive gastrin production, stimulating stomach acid and enzyme secretion. - **Clinical Effects:** - Elevated gastrin levels cause markedly increased stomach hydrochloric acid. - Overwhelms mucosal defense, leading to severe, recurrent peptic ulcers. - Ulcers are often numerous and may occur in atypical areas, including the small intestine. - Symptoms: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms due to high acid levels. - **Association with MEN1:** - ZES is associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). - MEN1 increases the risk of other endocrine tumors. - **Management:** - Aggressive acid suppression with high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). - Treatment directed at the gastrinoma: - Surgical resection. - Medication. - Other forms of therapy to control tumor growth and prevent complications. - 6. Q: How do NSAIDs contribute to the formation of peptic ulcers? - **NSAIDs and Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **Inhibition of Prostaglandin Synthesis:** - NSAIDs block COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. - Inhibition of COX-1 reduces prostaglandin production in the stomach. - Prostaglandins promote mucosal blood flow, stimulate bicarbonate and mucus secretion, and maintain gastric lining integrity. 2. **Direct Mucosal Damage:** - NSAIDs, being weak acids, directly irritate the gastric epithelium. - Direct irritation leads to mucosal damage and erosion. 3. **Impaired Mucosal Defense:** - Reduced prostaglandin synthesis diminishes the gastric mucosa’s ability to resist injury from gastric acid. - Impaired defense allows acid to cause further damage, leading to ulceration. 4. **Disruption of Mucosal Repair:** - NSAIDs not only impair protective factors but also impede mucosal recovery and repair after injury. 5. **Systemic Effects:** - NSAIDs cause systemic effects reducing gastroduodenal mucosa protection. - Effects include decreased blood flow to mucosal tissue, hindering healing and contributing to ulcer formation. - **Risk Factors for NSAID-induced Ulcers:** - Can occur in anyone using NSAIDs. - Higher risk with: - Higher doses. - Longer therapy duration. - History of peptic ulcer disease. - Elderly individuals. - Other risk factors. - **Cautious NSAID Use:** - Important to use NSAIDs cautiously, especially in populations at increased risk for peptic ulcers. - Consider gastroprotective agents (proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol) in high-risk patients. - 7. Q: Which factors can increase the risk of peptic ulcer development? - **Risk Factors for Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **H. pylori Infection:** - Most common cause significantly increases ulcer risk. 2. **Chronic NSAID Use:** - Regular use of ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, especially at higher doses, increases ulcer risk. 3. **Smoking:** - Nicotine in tobacco increases stomach acid and impairs healing, making smokers more susceptible to ulcers. 4. **Alcohol Consumption:** - Heavy alcohol use irritates and erodes the stomach lining, increasing acid production. 5. **Corticosteroid Medication:** - Corticosteroids, especially combined with NSAIDs, increase the risk of peptic ulcers. 6. **Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents:** - Warfarin and clopidogrel can raise the risk of bleeding from existing ulcers. 7. **Age:** - Older adults have an increased risk due to NSAID use, H. pylori, and age-related changes in the mucosal lining. 8. **Previous Ulcer History:** - Those with a history of peptic ulcers are more likely to develop them again. 9. **Stress:** - Severe stress, such as trauma or major surgery, can lead to stress-related mucosal disease and ulcers. 10. **Certain Medications:** - SSRIs, bisphosphonates, and potassium supplements can contribute to ulcer risk, especially when not taken as directed or with other ulcerogenic drugs. 11. **Medical Conditions:** - Conditions like Crohn’s disease or liver cirrhosis can increase the risk of peptic ulcers. 12. **Genetic Factors:** - Some families may have a genetic predisposition, as peptic ulcers appear to run in certain families. It is crucial for individuals with these risk factors to discuss ulcer prevention with healthcare providers, involving lifestyle modifications, gastroprotective agents, or H. pylori treatment if indicated. - 8. Q: What are the classic symptoms of a peptic ulcer? - **Classic Symptoms of Peptic Ulcers:** 1. **Epigastric Pain:** - Burning or gnawing pain in the upper middle abdomen, below the sternum (breastbone), extending from the navel to the chest. 2. **Meal-Related Fluctuations:** - Gastric ulcer pain worsens with eating, while duodenal ulcer pain may decrease with meals and return after a few hours. 3. **Nocturnal Pain:** - Duodenal ulcer pain may wake the patient at night. 4. **Antacid Relief:** - Temporary relief with antacids or acid-reducing medications. - **Other Associated Symptoms:** 1. **Bloating and Fullness.** 2. **Belching and Flatulence.** 3. **Nausea or Vomiting.** 4. **Changes in Appetite.** 5. **Weight Loss or Gain.** 6. **Bloody or Black Stools:** - Indicative of ulcer bleeding. 7. **Vomiting Blood:** - May occur with severe ulcer bleeding. These symptoms can vary in intensity and may be intermittent. Some individuals with peptic ulcers may not experience symptoms, and asymptomatic ulcers can be incidentally detected during investigations for other conditions. Additionally, peptic ulcers may present with complications like bleeding or perforation, leading to acute symptoms such as hematemesis, melena, acute abdomen, shock, or sepsis. - 9. Q: What are alarm symptoms in peptic ulcer disease that may suggest complications? **Alarm Symptoms in Peptic Ulcer Disease:** 1. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** - Vomiting blood (hematemesis), appearing as fresh red blood or coffee grounds. - Passing black, tarry stools (melena). 2. **Unintentional Weight Loss:** - Significant weight loss without intentional efforts, associated with malignancy or severe malabsorption. 3. **Progressive Dysphagia:** - Worsening difficulty swallowing, suggesting an obstruction or growth in the di agestive tract. 4. **Odynophagia:** - Painful swallowing, indicating esophageal or gastric ulceration. 5. **Persistent or Severe Vomiting:** - Sign of gastric outlet obstruction. 6. **Unexplained Anemia:** - Low red blood cell counts indicating chronic bleeding from an ulcer. 7. **Early Satiety:** - Feeling full quickly after eating, suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction or a mass. 8. **Palpable Abdominal Mass:** - Presence of a mass in the abdomen, indicating a tumor, enlarged organ, or scar tissue buildup from a healing ulcer. 9. **Acute, Severe Abdominal Pain:** - Sudden, sharp pain, possibly indicating a perforated ulcer or pancreatitis. The presence of any of these symptoms necessitates prompt endoscopic investigation or other relevant diagnostic studies to determine the cause and initiate timely management. Early detection of complications associated with peptic ulcer disease, such as bleeding, perforation, or malignancy, significantly influences prognosis and treatment outcomes. - 10. Q: How would you differentiate between peptic ulcer pain and that of acute pancreatitis? **Differentiating Peptic Ulcer Pain from Acute Pancreatitis:** 1. **Location and Nature of Pain:** - *Peptic Ulcer Pain:* Localized to the epigastric region, described as burning or gnawing, fluctuating in intensity, may radiate to the back. - *Acute Pancreatitis Pain:* Constant, severe, and dull pain, upper abdomen with radiation to the back, intensified after eating, especially fatty meals. 2. **Timing of Pain:** - *Peptic Ulcer Pain:* May worsen after eating (gastric ulcer) or improve after eating and then return later (duodenal ulcer), sometimes awakening at night. - *Acute Pancreatitis Pain:* Comes on quickly, doesn’t vary with eating or time of day. 3. **Associated Symptoms:** - *Peptic Ulcers:* Bloating, belching, temporary relief with antacids. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Persistent nausea, vomiting, fever, swollen and tender abdomen, fetal position for pain relief. 4. **Risk Factors:** - *Peptic Ulcer Disease:* NSAID use, H. pylori infection. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Heavy alcohol use, gallstones, elevated triglyceride levels. 5. **Physical Examination:** - *Peptic Ulcer:* Epigastric tenderness upon palpation. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding, signs like Grey Turner’s or Cullen’s sign. 6. **Laboratory and Imaging:** - *Peptic Ulcer:* Iron-deficiency anemia from chronic bleeding, possibly seen on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. - *Acute Pancreatitis:* Elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), imaging may reveal gallstones (ultrasound). Clinical assessment, including history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic tests, is essential for an accurate diagnosis between peptic ulcer pain and acute pancreatitis.","completion":"**Case Scenario:** Mary, a 58-year-old female with a past medical history of osteoarthritis, presents to the clinic complaining of a 4-week history of epigastric pain. She describes the pain as a gnawing sensation that occurs a few hours after eating and often wakes her up at night. She has been managing her osteoarthritis with over-the-counter ibuprofen several times a day. Recently, she notes that the pain has not been relieved by eating or antacids as it used to be. She also reports unintentional weight loss, bloating, and occasional black stools. **Questions:** 1. Given her history and symptoms, what are the likely causes of Mary's epigastric pain? 2. Based on the presenting symptoms, what type of ulcer is more likely present in Mary's condition? 3. Which one of the peptic ulcer causes previously mentioned is most likely contributing to Mary's condition? 4. Name two alarm symptoms that Mary is currently experiencing. 5. Considering Mary's regular use of ibuprofen for osteoarthritis, explain how this might have contributed to her current symptoms. 6. What further diagnostic test would you recommend for Mary to evaluate her symptoms? Please provide your answer for each question, and I will give you a score based on the accuracy of each response."},{"prompt":"1.since she has a past medical history of osteoarthritis i suppose she takes a lot of nsaids ibuprofen several times a day. which causes her a duodenal ulcer over time","completion":"Your answer addresses part of the scenario correctly. Mary's regular use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen is a well-established risk factor for the development of peptic ulcers. Given her symptoms of epigastric pain that occurs a few hours after eating and nocturnal pain, a duodenal ulcer is indeed more likely in her case. However, while you have correctly related her NSAID use to peptic ulcer disease, you did not address all possible causes, like H. pylori infection or other contributing factors from her background information (such as weight loss and black stools, which could signal complications). **Score:** 7/10 - You've recognized the link between NSAID use and ulcers as well as the suggested type of ulcer, but further details regarding other potential causes and the significance of alarm symptoms could improve the response."},{"prompt":"2. duodenal ulcer. asoften wakes her up at night. but i think no it is complicated with gastrointestinal bleeding (occasional black stools.) and weight loss","completion":"Your response identifies the duodenal ulcer based on the symptom of nocturnal pain, which is correct as such pain is characteristic of a duodenal ulcer. Moreover, you correctly identify the presence of black stools and weight loss which can indicate complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding. The black stools suggest the presence of melena, which indicates bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and weight loss could be due to decreased food intake because of pain or a sign of a more serious condition, such as malignancy. **Score:** 10/10 - You accurately identified the likely type of ulcer based on the nocturnal pain and also flagged crucial alarm symptoms indicating possible complications. Well done!"},{"prompt":"3.over-the-counter ibuprofen several times a day. maybe also h.pylori infection . stress due to her osteoarthritis . i dont know if she smokes or drinking alcohol nut these also etiological and risk factors contribute in her ulcer","completion":"You are correct to identify chronic NSAID use as a major contributing factor for Mary's ulcers, considering her frequent ibuprofen consumption for osteoarthritis pain management. Although H. pylori infection is a common cause of peptic ulcers, it has not been specifically implicated in Mary's case based on the presented scenario. However, it remains a possibility and should be investigated. Stress can exacerbate symptoms of peptic ulcer but is alone insufficient to cause ulcers. You correctly mention that without information regarding smoking or alcohol consumption, it cannot be concluded if these factors contribute to her condition, but they are recognized risk factors for peptic ulcer development. **Score:** 9/10 - Excellent job identifying the likely etiologies, acknowledging the potential of H. pylori, and considering additional lifestyle factors that were not ruled out in the information provided. Deducting a point for not distinguishing between the primary and secondary causes given Mary's specific situation."},{"prompt":"4. unintentional weight loss- melena","completion":"Correct. Unintentional weight loss and melena are both alarming symptoms in the context of peptic ulcer disease. Unintentional weight loss can be an indicator of a serious underlying condition such as malignancy, which always warrants further investigation. Melena, which is the appearance of black, tarry stools, suggests that bleeding is occurring within the upper gastrointestinal tract, a serious complication of peptic ulcer disease that requires immediate medical attention. **Score:** 10/10 - You have accurately identified the alarm symptoms that reflect possible complications of peptic ulcer disease in Mary's case."},{"prompt":"5. ibuprofen is nsaids which acting by blocking cox1 and cox2. blocking cox1 causes inhibition of prostaglandin secretion, decreasing bllod flow to gastric mucosa and weakening it against hcl","completion":"Your explanation correctly outlines the mechanism by which NSAIDs like ibuprofen contribute to ulcer formation. Ibuprofen inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, and it's the inhibition of COX-1 that disrupts the production of protective prostaglandins. This reduction in prostaglandins leads to decreased gastric mucosal blood flow and less mucus and bicarbonate production. As a result, the mucosal defense mechanisms against stomach acid are impaired, increasing the vulnerability of the stomach and duodenal lining to damage and ulceration. However, your response could be expanded by mentioning additional effects such as the direct irritation of the gastric epithelium that NSAIDs can cause. **Score:** 8/10 - Your answer is largely correct but could be improved by a more comprehensive overview of the effects of NSAIDs on the gastric mucosa, including direct topical effects."},{"prompt":"6. esophagogastrodudenscopy with a biopsy. stool antigen test of h.pylori diagnosis","completion":"Your recommendation for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with a biopsy is an excellent approach. EGD is the gold standard for diagnosing peptic ulcers, allowing for direct visualization of the ulcer, assessment of its size, location, and severity, and provides the means to obtain a biopsy if necessary to rule out malignancy, especially in the presence of alarm symptoms like unintentional weight loss. Additionally, the biopsy can be used to test for H. pylori, which is crucial given its prevalence as a cause of peptic ulcers. The stool antigen test for H. pylori is also appropriate. It is a non-invasive test used to diagnose H. pylori infection, one of the primary causes of peptic ulcers. This test would be part of a comprehensive approach to Mary's diagnosis, especially if EGD is not immediately available, or in conjunction with EGD for confirmation. **Score:** 10/10 - Your suggested diagnostic tests are appropriate for the symptoms and possible complications presented in the clinical scenario. Your response shows an understanding of the diagnostic process for peptic ulcer disease."},{"prompt":"В XVIII веке реформы в организации медицинского управления и инновации в медицинском образовании[26] в России сыграли важную роль в формировании отечественных медицинских кадров.

Flagstaff has an equity cost of capital of 13%, a debt cost of capital of 7%, and it is in the 35% corporate tax bracket. b. If Flagstaff currently maintains a .5 debt to equity ratio, what is the value of Flagstaff’s interest tax shield? (200 words)","completion":"To calculate the value of Flagstaff’s interest tax shield, we need to consider the benefits of the tax deductibility of interest payments. Interest tax shield is the reduction in income taxes due to the tax-deductible interest expense. In a perfect world with no bankruptcy costs or agency costs, and efficient markets, according to the Modigliani-Miller theorem, the value of the tax shield is the tax rate times the value of the debt. First, let's calculate the market value of Flagstaff's debt (D) and equity (E). If Flagstaff maintains a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5, this implies that for every 1 of equity, there is 0.5 of debt. To find the market value of the equity (E), we can use the Gordon Growth Model since we are given that Flagstaff’s free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) grows at a constant rate. We know that FCFF is essentially the free cash flow available to all capital holders, so we can use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to discount the FCF as there is debt in Flagstaff's capital structure. However, since we are only looking for the interest tax shield, we won't need the total value of the firm. Instead, we only need the market value of the debt which benefits directly from the tax shield. We can also find the value of the tax shield directly through the formula: Tax Shield = Corporate Tax Rate x Value of Debt But we don't have the value of debt directly. We need to calculate it using the given debt to equity ratio. Let's assume for simplicity that the market value of equity is E and therefore, the market value of debt will be 0.5E. Next, we can calculate the value of the tax shield using the formula: Value of Tax Shield = Corporate Tax Rate x Debt x Cost of Debt Knowing that the corporate tax rate is 35%, and the cost of capital of debt is 7%, we incorporate the debt to equity ratio to find the value of the interest tax shield. Let's denote the corporate tax rate as Tc, cost of debt as Rd, and the debt to equity ratio as D/E. Value of Tax Shield = Tc * Rd * (D/E * E) Value of Tax Shield = 0.35 * 0.07 * (0.5 * E) We can simplify this to: Value of Tax Shield = 0.01225 * E We don't have the exact value of E from the information provided, but we do have the relationship needed to calculate the tax shield. To find E, we would need the overall value of the firm and subtract the value of the debt. But since this requires additional steps and information that we don't have, we'll focus only on the interest tax shield aspect as requested. If we had the actual market value of equity, we could plug that into our final equation to calculate the Interest Tax Shield directly. Without the market value of equity (E), we cannot solve for a specific dollar value for the Interest Tax Shield. So the answer is dependent on the market value of equity, which we denote as E in the final equation."},{"prompt":"hatbot Flagstaff Enterprises is expected to have free cash flow in the coming year of 8 million, and this free cash flow is expected to grow at a rate of 3% per year thereafter.

If Flagstaff currently maintains a .5 debt to equity ratio, what is the value of Flagstaff’s interest tax shield? (100 words)","completion":"a. To value Flagstaff using the given debt to equity ratio and the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), we can calculate the value of the firm using the Gordon Growth Model adapted for FCFF, which is the perpetual growth formula. Let's denote the FCFF as C1, the constant growth rate as g, and the equity cost of capital as Re. The value of the firm's equity (Ve) can be calculated as: Ve = C1 / (Re - g) Ve = 8 million / (0.13 - 0.03) Ve = 8 million / 0.10 Ve = 80 million Since we are given a 0.5 debt to equity ratio (D/E), calculate the value of debt (D): D = Ve * (D/E) D = 80 million * 0.5 D = 40 million The total value of the firm (V) is the sum of the value of debt and equity: V = Ve + D V = 80 million + 40 million V = 120 million b.

John 1:1 \\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\\" Counter-Argument: Some claim that the term \\"Word\\" (Logos) could be considered a divine attribute rather than the literal personification of Jesus. They draw from other philosophies and theologies to suggest alternative meanings, such as God's plan or reasoning. 2. John 1:14 \\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\\" Counter-Argument: This could be interpreted as the embodiment of God's intentions or characteristics in a human, not necessarily establishing Jesus as fully God but as a vessel or agent. 3. John 10:30 \\"I and the Father are one.\\" Counter-Argument: This could be interpreted to mean in purpose and will, not in essence. Jesus being unified with God in mission does not necessarily make him God Himself. 4. John 20:28 \\"Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord and my God!'\\" Counter-Argument: Thomas's exclamation can be viewed as a moment of shock or as hyperbolic acknowledgement of Jesus' divine connection or authority, not necessarily a literal claim about his divine nature. 5. Colossians 2:9 \\"For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.\\" Counter-Argument: This may suggest a special indwelling of divine attributes rather than asserting that Jesus is fully and completely God. 6. Hebrews 1:3 \\"The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.\\" Counter-Argument: One might argue that representation is not equivalence. An image or icon can fully represent something without being that thing itself. 7. Philippians 2:6 \\"[Jesus], being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage.\\" Counter-Argument: Some interpret this to mean that Jesus had a divine form or status but chose to not cling to its benefits, emphasizing the humility rather than the divinity. 8. John 8:58 \\"Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.'\\" Counter-Argument: Critics argue that \\"I am\\" could refer to pre-existence or special status rather than Jesus claiming to be the God of the Old Testament. 9. Titus 2:13 \\"Waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.\\" Counter-Argument: The Greek grammar could potentially allow for a separation between \\"God\\" and \\"Savior,\\" referring to two entities rather than one. 10. Matthew 1:23 \\"'Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel' (which means, God with us).\\" Counter-Argument: Immanuel as a name can signify God's presence with his people through Jesus, rather than a literal claim of Jesus being God. 11. Revelation 1:8 \\"I am the Alpha and the Omega,\\" says the Lord God, \\"who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.\\" Counter-Argument: While this is spoken by God, some argue that it doesn't clearly state that Jesus is the speaker, and thus doesn't necessarily declare Jesus as God. 12. 1 Timothy 3:16 \\"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\\" Counter-Argument: Some argue that \\"God was manifest in the flesh\\" could be interpreted metaphorically, reflecting God's actions and qualities in the life of Jesus. 13. Isaiah 9:6 \\"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\\" Counter-Argument: Opponents could argue that this is a prophetic hyperbole, commonly found in ancient texts, to exalt a king with titles of honor and is not meant to be taken literally. 14. 1 John 5:20 \\"And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.\\" Counter-Argument: The subject of the final sentence can be argued to be referring to God the Father rather than Jesus, especially in the original Greek text's structure. 15. Romans 9:5 \\"To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.\\" Counter-Argument: The phrase \\"who is God over all\\" could be a doxology directed to God rather than an assertion of the Christ's divinity, depending on the interpretation of punctuation and syntax in the original Greek. It's important to note that these counter-arguments can vary greatly in theological perspectives, and the understanding of such texts can be quite complex involving nuances in language, hermeneutics, and doctrinal positions. The traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity holds that Jesus is both fully God and fully human, and those adhering to this belief find ample support for it in the Bible. However, other religious perspectives, including some Christian denominations, interpret these scriptures differently."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"If you're looking for additional verses that are commonly cited to support the claim of Jesus' divinity, here are a few more, along with potential counter-arguments that some individuals or non-traditional Christian groups might use. 16. John 17:5 \\"And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.\\" Counter-Argument: This could be seen as Jesus speaking metaphorically about predestined glory or foreknowledge rather than actual pre-existence as God. 17. Revelation 22:13 \\"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.\\" Counter-Argument: Some assert that Jesus is assuming a role in the divine purpose rather than claiming literal divinity; roles are often given or bestowed in a divine economy without necessarily indicating ontological equality with God. 18. John 5:18 \\"This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\\" Counter-Argument: The accusation made by Jesus' opponents does not necessarily reflect Jesus’ own claims or intentions; opponents may have misunderstood or misrepresented Jesus' statements. 19. John 14:9 \\"Jesus said to him, 'Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?'\\" Counter-Argument: This could be interpreted as Jesus indicating that seeing him is the same as seeing the Father because he perfectly represents God’s character and will, not because he is God in a literal sense. 20. Matthew 28:19 \\"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\\" Counter-Argument: Some argue that the formula here points to a unity of purpose or a shared divine mission rather than equating Jesus with God in essence. 21. 2 Peter 1:1 \\"To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.\\" Counter-Argument: The Greek could be rendered to refer to two subjects, 'God' and 'Savior, Jesus Christ,' rather than a singular 'God and Savior, Jesus Christ.' 22. Acts 20:28 \\"Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God which he obtained with his own blood.\\" Counter-Argument: Some interpret this as the blood of Jesus, whom God used to purchase the church, rather than suggesting that God Himself has blood. 23. 1 Corinthians 8:6 \\"Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.\\" Counter-Argument: This could simply denote roles within creation and salvation, without indicating ontological oneness with the Father. 24. Revelation 1:17-18 \\"When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, 'Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.'\\" Counter-Argument: It can be taken as Jesus holding positions of authority granted to him (such as the keys of Death and Hades), without being the same being as God Almighty. 25. John 8:24 \\"I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.\\" Counter-Argument: \\"I am he\\" could mean the Messiah or God's chosen one, rather than God Himself. The counter-arguments provided are from a point of view that doesn't hold the traditional Trinitarian doctrine as the interpretive framework for these verses. Interpretations can vary greatly among religious scholars and are influenced by different theological and doctrinal stances. Each interpretation requires careful consideration of the biblical text, cultural and literary context, and underlying Greek or Hebrew terminology."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Certainly! Here are more verses cited to argue for the divinity of Jesus Christ in Christianity, with accompanying counter-arguments that some may use to reject a literal interpretation of His divinity. 26. John 3:13 \\"No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.\\" Counter-Argument: This could emphasize the unique heavenly authority and revelation Jesus possesses, not necessarily His pre-existence or ontological divinity. 27. 1 John 4:15 \\"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.\\" Counter-Argument: The title \\"Son of God\\" could be read in a metaphorical sense, common in Jewish culture, to mean chosen servant or anointed king, rather than a literal divine status. 28. Romans 1:3-4 \\"Concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.\\" Counter-Argument: This could signify a divine appointment or vindication at the resurrection rather than inherence in the divine nature from eternity. 29. Acts 7:59 \\"And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.'\\" Counter-Argument: Stephen's plea can be seen as a request to a heavenly intermediary or agent rather than equating Jesus directly with God. 30. Colossians 1:15-16 \\"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible...\\" Counter-Argument: \\"Firstborn\\" could imply preeminence in rank rather than creator status; \\"image\\" suggests representation rather than identity. 31. 1 Corinthians 15:47 \\"The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.\\" Counter-Argument: This can be interpreted as Jesus being from heaven in a figurative sense, as his mission and message are divine, but not that he is inherently divine. 32. Philippians 2:9-11 \\"Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth...\\" Counter-Argument: Exaltation by God implies that Jesus has been given authority rather than inherently possessing it; it points to elevation, not equality with God. 33. Acts 9:3-5 \\"Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest. And asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.\\" Counter-Argument: While often seen differently, the light from heaven and Jesus' appearance to Saul (Paul) could be understood as a special heavenly calling without implying actual deity. 34. Revelation 19:16 \\"On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.\\" Counter-Argument: These titles could denote supreme earthly authority that God has granted to Jesus, similar to the way ancient monarchs were sometimes given exalted titles without being considered deities. 35. Matthew 9:6 \\"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins... then He said to the paralytic — 'Rise, pick up your bed and go home.'\\" Counter-Argument: Authority to forgive sins could be seen as a delegated power from God to Jesus, making it more of an endorsement of his messianic mission than divinity. Each counter-argument represents a perspective that challenges traditional Trinitarian interpretations of these verses, such as those held by Unitarians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims, Jewish scholars, and others who do not ascribe to the divinity of Jesus. Interpretations are influenced by many factors including doctrinal beliefs, linguistic analysis, and contextual understanding of the scriptures."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Let's continue providing verses with traditional Christian interpretations of Jesus' divinity and possible counter-arguments from a theological perspective that challenges those interpretations: 36. Matthew 22:41-45 \\"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' ... If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus could be highlighting the Messiah's superior, divinely appointed role rather than asserting inherent divinity. The concept of a lord could be honorific and not necessarily imply full divinity. 37. John 14:11 \\"Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.\\" Counter-Argument: Mutual in-dwelling (\\"in me\\" and \\"in the Father\\") could be understood in terms of unity of will and purpose rather than ontological unity. 38. Colossians 1:19 \\"For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.\\" Counter-Argument: The \\"fullness of God\\" could be seen as the plenitude of God's attributes expressed in Jesus (like wisdom, love, and power), rather than Jesus being the totality of God Himself. 39. 1 John 5:7 (Johannine Comma, found in the Textus Receptus but not in most modern translations) \\"For there are three that testify: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.\\" Counter-Argument: This passage is not found in the earliest and most reliable New Testament manuscripts, and its late addition suggests it does not reflect the original text and therefore cannot be used as evidence for the divinity of Jesus. 40. Hebrews 1:8 \\"But of the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.'\\" Counter-Argument: This quote from Psalm 45 could be attributed to the author of Hebrews using a royal psalm and applying it to Jesus in a figurative or honorific sense. 41. Matthew 16:16 \\"Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'\\" Counter-Argument: \\"Son of the living God\\" can be understood as a recognition of Jesus' messianic role and divine appointment, rather than a literal equation with God. 42. John 16:15 \\"All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.\\" Counter-Argument: This could refer to the sharing of divine knowledge and mission between the Father and the Son without implying that they are the same being. 43. Revelation 21:6-7 \\"And he said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.'\\" Counter-Argument: Some argue that while these titles suggest divinity, they are primarily about the eschatological role of Jesus rather than his ontological identity. 44. John 1:18 \\"No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.\\" Counter-Argument: This verse, particularly in some translations, is ambiguous and could be understood to mean either that Jesus is distinct from God yet has unique insight into God, or that he is himself divine. 45. Acts 2:36 \\"Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\\" Counter-Argument: The title \\"Lord\\" here can be interpreted as a recognition of Jesus' exalted status conferred by God, rather than equating him with God. 46. Hebrews 13:8 \\"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.\\" Counter-Argument: This can be seen as a statement about the constancy and reliability of Jesus' message and character rather than a declaration of eternal divinity. As with all religious texts, interpretations can be subjective and heavily influenced by tradition, theology, and personal beliefs. The counter-arguments provided here are shaped by alternative theologies that do not interpret these verses as affirmations of Jesus' literal divinity. Each view requires careful scriptural and theological examination."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"It's important to recognize that while I can continue listing verses and providing counter-arguments, the core set of scriptures used to support Jesus' divinity is finite, and beyond those, arguments become less directly related to divinity and more interpretative. That said, here are additional verses along with potential counter-arguments: 47. John 12:45 \\"And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.\\" Counter-Argument: This could suggest that by seeing Jesus' actions and hearing his words, one can understand God's character and will, not necessarily that Jesus is literally God. 48. Matthew 25:31-32 \\"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another...\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus' role as judge can be seen as a divine function given by God to the Messiah, denoting divine authority but not divinity itself. 49. 1 Timothy 2:5 \\"For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\\" Counter-Argument: Emphasizing Jesus as a mediator underscores his humanity and could be interpreted as his fulfillment of a unique role rather than his identity as God. 50. 1 Corinthians 10:4 \\"And all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.\\" Counter-Argument: The identification of Christ with the Rock in the wilderness can be viewed as a metaphor for Christ's prefigurative or typological role in salvation history. 51. Hebrews 1:2 \\"But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.\\" Counter-Argument: This could be seen as the Son being the agent through whom God creates, a role of honor and function without implying equality with God. 52. John 6:38 \\"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.\\" Counter-Argument: A contrast is drawn between Jesus' own will and that of the Father, implying subordination and distinctness from the Father, which some may argue against the notion of inherent divinity. 53. John 1:3 \\"All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.\\" Counter-Argument: Being a conduit for creation as an agent of God can be distinguished from being the ultimate Creator, the view continuing the theme of Jesus' divine appointment rather than equality with God. 54. John 2:19 \\"Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.'\\" Counter-Argument: The raising of the temple (his body) may be attributed to divine power working through Jesus, particularly given that elsewhere in Scripture God is accredited with raising Jesus from the dead. 55. Mark 14:62 \\"And Jesus said, 'I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.'\\" Counter-Argument: Being seated at God's right hand is a place of honor and delegated authority, which can be interpreted separately from being identical to God. 56. John 10:38 \\"But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\\" Counter-Argument: The mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son may reflect a perfect harmony and unity of purpose rather than a shared essence. 57. Revelation 2:23 \\"And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works.\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus’ ability to search minds and hearts can be seen as a divinely granted capacity rather than an innate divine attribute. Interpreting these verses within their religious and cultural context is crucial, and the counter-arguments reflect an alternate viewpoint that sees Jesus as an extraordinary figure empowered by God, but not God Himself. Different Christian denominations and other religious traditions may have varied interpretations of the nature of Jesus based on their particular creedal statements, doctrinal teachings, or scriptural emphases."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"Continuing with additional verses referenced in Christian doctrine to support the divinity of Jesus and possible counter-arguments from different theological perspectives: 58. Hebrews 4:14-15 \\"Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses...\\" Counter-Argument: The role of high priest implies an intermediary position, someone who stands between God and humans, which can be interpreted as supporting Jesus' unique holiness and authority without necessarily elevating him to divine status. 59. 2 Corinthians 4:4 \\"In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\\" Counter-Argument: Being the \\"image of God\\" can be taken to mean that Jesus perfectly reflects God's attributes and character; it doesn't definitively state that he is God. 60. Ephesians 1:22 \\"And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church...\\" Counter-Argument: God putting all things under Jesus' feet suggests delegation of authority, an honor that can be distinguished from suggesting Jesus is himself the Supreme Authority. 61. 2 Corinthians 5:19 \\"That is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.\\" Counter-Argument: This verse may indicate that God was working through Christ as an instrument of divine purposes, which need not imply that Jesus is God Himself. 62. 1 Corinthians 8:6 \\"Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we live, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we live.\\" Counter-Argument: While this verse mentions both the Father and Jesus, it can be argued that they have distinct roles, with \\"one God\\" indicating supremacy and \\"one Lord\\" indicating a role granted by God. 63. Luke 22:70 \\"Then they all said, 'Are you then the Son of God?' He replied, 'You say that I am.'\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus’ affirmation of being the Son of God could be understood to confirm his messianic identity rather than equating him fully with God. 64. Acts 10:36 \\"As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)...\\" Counter-Argument: Proclaiming Jesus as \\"Lord of all\\" can be seen as acknowledging his divine-mandated authority rather than innate divinity. 65. Matthew 10:40 \\"Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.\\" Counter-Argument: Receiving Jesus as if he were God could speak to accepting the authority and message he carries from God, but not necessarily claim that he is God in essence. 66. 1 Timothy 6:15-16 \\"He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.\\" Counter-Argument: While this can be interpreted as Jesus being described with divine titles, others may argue these attributes apply to God the Father, distinguishing Him from Jesus. 67. John 13:13 \\"You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.\\" Counter-Argument: The terms \\"Teacher\\" and \\"Lord\\" can be titles of respect and do not conflate Jesus with God but show his position as Master within the context of his disciples. Interpreting these references to Jesus' divinity involves a nuanced understanding of the scriptural language, cultural context, and theological implications. Counter-arguments to the traditional doctrine of the divinity of Jesus arise from various non-traditional Christian theologies, as well as other Abrahamic and non-Christian faith perspectives. These interpretations often focus on the extraordinary nature of Jesus' mission, his deep connection with God, and the divine empowerment he received, rather than direct equivalence with God."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"As we get further into the Scripture, the verses that are cited to affirm Jesus' divinity become more interpretive and require a greater degree of theological inference. Here are additional verses and alternative interpretations: 68. John 6:51 \\"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.\\" Counter-Argument: This could be understood as Jesus describing his divine mission metaphorically. The \\"bread of life\\" signifies the spiritual sustenance Jesus provides, not necessarily his own divinity. 69. 1 Peter 3:22 \\"Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.\\" Counter-Argument: Being at God's right hand represents a position of honor and authority granted by God, not innate divinity. 70. 1 Corinthians 2:8 \\"None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\\" Counter-Argument: The title \\"Lord of glory\\" is seen as a reflection of Jesus' status in God's plan, indicative of honor and authority rather than an outright claim of being God. 71. 1 John 3:16 \\"By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus' sacrificial love can be recognized as an expression of God’s love without necessitating that he is God. 72. Matthew 26:63-64 \\"But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, 'I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus said to him, 'You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus' response may be interpreted to affirm the divine authority he's been given and his role in God's plan, distinct from identifying as God Himself. 73. 1 Timothy 1:15-16 \\"The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.\\" Counter-Argument: This passage speaks to Jesus' role in God's redemptive plan and his exemplification of divine qualities, without stating his divinity. 74. Luke 1:32-33 \\"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\\" Counter-Argument: The prophecy reveals Jesus as a royal figure with a special relationship to God, which can be viewed as a messianic role rather than an indication of his divinity. 75. Romans 14:9 \\"For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.\\" Counter-Argument: Jesus being \\"Lord of the dead and of the living\\" might be seen as him having authority within the realm of God's creation due to the significance of his life, death, and resurrection. The variety of counter-arguments here illustrates the complexity of biblical interpretation and the breadth of theological thought within Christianity and other religions. Each of these passages can be nuanced and have deep exegetical backgrounds, and the explanations provided here are brief and general. The views of those who do not affirm the traditional understanding of Jesus' divinity are varied and can range from him being a prophet, a divinely mandated agent, or a unique creation of God, to being the Son of God in a non-literal, adoptive or honorific sense."},{"prompt":"A hypothetical Goodies episode - Bill ,Tim and Graeme arrive at the office , all ranting about how inconsiderate some motorists are to cyclists, as if they just didn't see the Goodies Trandem. Tim wonders if the drivers just don't care, while bill ever pragmatic says ominously \\"something should be done\\" .. Graeme suggests coming up with various ways to improve the trandem's visibility, or to make drivers more aware of them and other cyclists... (There may be some nods despite the comedic tone to actual sensible road safety ideas..)","completion":"Title: The Goodies: Bright Ride Opening scene: The Goodies tumble into their office, having just survived another harrowing ride on their iconic trandem bike. Tim's trademark Union Jack waistcoat is slightly tattered, and Bill's beard is even grubbier than usual. Graeme's glasses are askew. Tim (exasperated): \\"I simply cannot fathom the gall of some motorists! It’s as if we’re invisible on the road!\\" Bill (grumbling): \\"Eh, they don't care about us cyclists. They're just wrapped up in their metal boxes!\\" Graeme (ponderously): \\"Gentlemen, I propose we employ our intellectual prowess to enhance our trandem's visibility. Ergo, making the road safer for all pedallers!\\" The camera zooms in on the trio as they engage in their signature group nod, embarking on yet another quirky adventure. Act 1: The Visibility Conundrum Sitting around a chalkboard, the Goodies brainstorm absurdly over-the-top solutions: 1. Bill suggests attaching Roman candles to the trandem, ensuring a trail of sparks that no driver could ignore. 2. Tim, with an eye for fashion, pitches the idea of garish neon lycra suits that could blind onlookers at a hundred paces. 3. Graeme, the team's boffin, sketches out a design for a trandem equipped with a massive lighthouse beacon on the front and a foghorn for good measure. Montage: The Goodies attempt each idea with comical failure. The Roman candles set a motorist's toupee aflame, the neon suits cause a rash, and the lighthouse beacon is mistaken for an alien invasion signal. Act 2: The Enlightenment Amidst their failures, Graeme has a eureka moment – perhaps what they need isn't to improve the trandem's visibility, but rather the drivers' awareness and consideration. Graeme (with inspiration): \\"We need to enlighten the drivers about the experience of being a cyclist!\\" The Goodies set out to create a public awareness campaign, including: 1. A slapstick silent film where they dramatically act out the dangers cyclists face. 2. A catchy jingle performed by Bill, with Tim on the tambourine, that gets stuck in everyone’s head: \\"Look out! Look twice! Cyclists are nice!\\" 3. Graeme leading a science segment on television explaining the physics of bicycle safety and the importance of sharing the road. Through these means, they begin to garner public support and empathy for cyclists. Act 3: The Trial Run Sure of their success, the Goodies once again take to the roads on their trandem. This time, however, they’ve organized a large group of bicycle enthusiasts to join them, creating a can't-miss spectacle. The publicity from their campaign pays off. Motorists are more attentive, giving the cyclists a wide berth. The townspeople cheer from the sidewalks, and local news crews cover the event. Inevitably, the episode culminates in the Goodies' overconfidence leading to chaos. Perhaps the trandem comes apart after being over-zealously upgraded by Graeme, scattering the trio across a roundabout. Or maybe their visibility campaign proves too effective, causing a parade of gawkers to inadvertently bring traffic to a standstill. Closing scene: Back in the office, battered but not beaten, the Goodies watch the news coverage of their event. Despite the pandemonium they caused, there’s a sense of accomplishment among them. Tim (proudly): \\"Look, at least we’ve got everyone talking about bicycle safety!\\" Bill (philosophically): \\"Sometimes, you've got to create a rumpus to bring about change.\\" Graeme (nodding sagely): \\"Precisely! Our visibility might not have been the problem, but now our message is crystal clear!\\" The camera zooms out as the Goodies share a laugh, content that they've made the world a slightly better, if not sillier, place.

A giant fan, dubbed \\"The Cloudblaster\\", which they plan to use to blow the clouds away from Britain. 2. \\"Glitterstorms\\", where they load up rockets with glitter and fire them into the storm clouds, theoretically causing them to rain faster and leave a sparkle in the air once the sun comes out. Montage: The Goodies construct these bizarre contraptions with typical slapstick mishaps. The Cloudblaster only succeeds in blowing Tim's hat off and disturbing a flock of seaside seagulls, while the first Glitterstorm rocket launch transforms the Goodies themselves into sparkling, soggy messes. Act 2: The Great British Flake-off Undeterred, Graeme perfects his designs, and the trio makes another attempt, this time targeting Brighton Beach. However, the \\"improved\\" Cloudblaster backfires, resulting in a freak snowstorm that blankets the beach in winter white.

They hastily modify the Cloudblaster into a giant hairdryer to melt the snow and work on a new project, the \\"Sunbeam Amplifier,\\" to bring some much-needed warmth. Their antics gain media attention, with reporting that veers between excitement and exasperation. After several failed attempts involving magnifying glasses, heat lamps, and even an ill-advised attempt at a dance ritual to summon the sun, something miraculous happens. The Goodies' contraptions unexpectedly interact with the local environment, causing a spontaneous and spectacular clearing of the skies. The sun shines down brilliantly for the first time in weeks, drying up the snow and warming the citizens. Everyone rejoices, and the Goodies are hailed as heroes for a fleeting moment.

All seems well until a stray cloud, looking suspiciously sparkly, hovers over the Goodies. Tim (nervously): \\"Erm, Graeme, that wouldn't be one of our 'Glitterstorm' clouds, would it?\\" Graeme (gulping): \\"Probably just a coincidence...\\" Suddenly, it begins to rain glitter all over the Goodies, sparkling in the sunshine. The crowd laughs and dances under the glittery downpour, turning the mishap into a beach party.

Unaware of its true nature, the Goodies brace themselves for its arrival on shore. It disgorges vehicles and passengers onto the beach as the Goodies crouch in their rock-tent, slack-jawed. Bill (dumbfounded): \\"Would you look at that! It's spitting out Mini Coopers!\\" Graeme (suppressing laughter): \\"Indeed, what a monstrous appetite!\\" Act 3: The Goodies Go Hovering The Goodies debate how best to capture this metal-munching sea beast. Tim suggests luring it with a decoy car filled with mackerel, while Bill, ever the practical one, raids the picnic basket to concoct a trail of snacks from the shore to their oversized net. Graeme, ensuring they don’t actually interfere with the hovercraft service, persuades a bemused hovercraft pilot to let the Goodies commandeer the vessel for a bit of fun. They take a \\"joyride,” only to discover they’re hopeless at piloting the behemoth machine. The ensuing chaos sees them inadvertently chasing sunbathers, scattering deck chairs, and causing a minor panic.

Around them, confused beachgoers are picking up scattered items and shaking off the last of the hovercraft's spray.

Tim (brimming with earnestness): \\"Chaps, I've decided it's time the Goodies did some good! Volunteering! Giving back to the community!\\" Bill (eyeing Tim with suspicion): \\"Work for free? Sounds like a terrible business model.\\" Graeme (distractedly): \\"Curious. Did you know that all these beautiful but crumbling landmarks are just one budget cut away from becoming ruins?\\" Tim (suddenly inspired): \\"That's it! We can combine volunteering and tourism. 'Working holidays!'\\" Bill (raising an eyebrow): \\"You mean, get people to pay for the privilege of work? That’s just mad enough to work...\\" Act 1: The Pitch Seated around a makeshift drawing board, the Goodies hatch their plan to turn volunteer work into vacation gold. 1. Tim suggests selling the experience as a chance to reconnect with the land and history, complete with period costumes and photo opportunities. 2. Graeme calculates the cost of tools and gear versus the price they could charge for authenticity, noting they'll need gimmicks to attract attention. 3. Bill pitches the idea of 'adventure volunteering,' like repainting the Forth Bridge while bungee jumping or whitewashing ancient castles using paintball guns. Montage: The Goodies engage in a door-to-door campaign, cheesy TV commercials, and a series of increasingly outrageous stunts to garner public interest in their \\"voluntourism\\" escapades. Act 2: The First Excursion The Goodies' first outing features train buffs given the chance to restore a section of railway line, complete with a steam train ride. Graeme dons a conductor's cap, Bill markets \\"authentic soot\\" as a fashionable manly cologne, and Tim tries to keep up morale with a sing-along of railway tunes. Next, they organize the planting of a hedge maze where the \\"hedge planters\\" are dressed as druids, with the promise of discovering one's inner Celt, while a group of kind old ladies dispense seemingly endless cups of tea from a cart labeled \\"Ye Olde Hedge-Aid\\". It's all fun and novelty until the volunteers start realizing this is much harder than advertised. Act 3: All Work and No Play? Things take a turn when the laborious nature of manual work starts to wear on the vacationers. The thrill of painting the bridge loses its appeal after the tenth bucket of paint, and one of the hedge planters accidentally trims a section into an unsightly bald patch, causing a Druidic 'incident'. The Goodies scramble to keep the illusion of \\"fun\\" alive, introducing impromptu activities like 'Find the Golden Trowel' and 'Pickaxe Piñata'. Suffice to say, these too descend into absurdity. Closing Scene: With the sun setting on their first attempt at voluntourism, the Goodies tally up the cost of damages, tool replacements, and refund requests. However, all is not lost; the participants, though exhausted, have inadvertently built community spirit and actually restored a small part of the railway line and planted half a hedge maze. Tim (brightly): \\"Look on the bright side. We might not have made a profit, but we’ve made a difference!\\" Bill (dryly, covered in paint): \\"Next time, let's just send them on a nice, normal holiday. Like alligator wrestling.\\" Graeme (adjusting his glasses): \\"An interesting notion, Bill. Could be a tremendous saving on handbags and shoes...\\" As they banter, a local news crew arrives, praising the Goodies for their innovative approach to heritage conservation. The public, inspired by the coverage, begin to volunteer outright—no holiday needed. Cue the Goodies theme tune while showing snapshots of their quirky 'working holiday' beset with comedic mishaps, creating a series of increasingly bizarre and delightful episodes.

Suddenly, sparks fly and a crazed laugh emanates from the next room. Bursting in, they find Graeme wrapped in wires and coated in soot, exuding the air of a mad scientist. Graeme (excitedly): \\"Behold, my greatest invention! A sustainable power source! With the electricity from an eel and the simple beauty of a jellyfish, I shall revolutionize energy!\\" Tim (uneasily): \\"But Graeme, isn't that a bit... unnatural?\\" Bill (dubiously): \\"And what's stopping it from turning into a monster movie calamity?\\" Graeme (waving dismissively): \\"Pish-posh! It's perfectly safe... I think.\\" Act 1: The Jolt of Genius Graeme unveils his creation—the \\"Electric Jellyfish\\"—which is actually an intricate arc rectifier housed in a bubbling aquarium that vaguely resembles a theatrical jellyfish. Graeme (boastfully): \\"Imagine! A self-sustaining power supply that glows in the dark!\\" Montage: They promote the Electric Jellyfish as a green energy marvel. Graeme proudly lectures at science fairs, while Bill and Tim showcase the jellyfish to bewildered energy magnates and environmental groups, highlighting its low carbon finprint. Act 2: Unleashed Energy During one of Graeme's demonstrations, the Electric Jellyfish's tank malfunctions due to a mischievous seagull picking at the power cables. The Electric Jellyfish \\"escapes,\\" and soon the entire building is crackling with rogue electricity as the jellyfish seemingly grows and leaps from appliance to appliance. Cue Quatermass/B-movie homage with a lighthearted score: Streetlights flicker, televisions switch on to static, and arcades light up without a coin. The Goodies pursue their creation as it sparks controversy—and electrical fires—across the city. Act 3: Current Affairs With panic mounting, the Goodies suit up in rubber waders wielding oversized butterfly nets, ready to capture their electrifying escapee. Montage: The chase intensifies, with the Goodies dodging electric bolts, Bill occasionally getting shocked, and Graeme and Tim bickering over the map. They trace the Electric Jellyfish to an electrified city park. Graeme (determined): \\"We must catch it and return it to containment before it gives someone a shocking surprise!\\" Bill (frustrated): \\"Let's just zap it back to oblivion!\\" Tim (cautiously): \\"Remember, no violence. It might be... sensitive.\\" Their attempts include deploying a giant electric-proof blanket, luring it with a Tesla coil, and convincing a brave cat to help herd it. Closing Scene: The Electric Jellyfish, now the size of a beach ball and buzzing like a neon sign, is cornered at a local swimming pool turned disco (due to the Jellyfish's electrical influence). Using coordinated dance moves, the Goodies \\"boogie\\" the jellyfish into a giant jar, secured by an immense rubber stopper. Graeme (apologetically): \\"Perhaps back to the drawing board with that one.\\" Tim (laughing): \\"At least we've charged up the town's nightlife!\\" Bill (shaking his head): \\"I'll stick to my pedal power. It's less shocking.\\" The Electric Jellyfish is safely returned to the lab, now secured with triple redundancy. The Goodies, hailed as heroes for lighting up the city and subsequently saving it from an energy crisis, are last seen pedaling away on their trandem into the electrified night. Cue the Goodies theme tune and credits, interspersed with silly outtakes of the electrifying caper, including a sequence where the Goodies get shocked into an impromptu dance routine. Fade to black, leaving viewers with an illuminated sense of both caution and amusement about the electrifying possibilities of science gone awry."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Goodies Episode - The Lost Slate Mine of Blaneau Valley - ( This episode is a riff on King Solomon's mines, albiet with a Welsh twist.. and Guest Star Pertwee as a Welsh tenor/guide that knows whee the Lost Slate mine is..)","completion":"Title: The Goodies: The Lost Slate Mine of Blaneau Valley Opening Scene: In the cozy Goodies office, Tim reads a dusty book about the legendary King Solomon's mines. As he waxes poetic about adventure and discovery, Bill scoffs at the practicality of treasure hunting. Graeme, tinkering with a makeshift divining rod designed to find precious stones, brings up a local legend. Graeme (enthusiastically): \\"There's talk of a lost slate mine right here in Wales—the Blaneau Valley hoard, untouched for centuries!\\" Tim (intrigued): \\"Gents, adventure awaits! Think of the historical significance!\\" Bill (rolling his eyes): \\"And the hard hats. Think of the hard hats!\\" Just then, a rollicking Welsh ballad drifts in from the street. The Goodies look out to see a boisterous Welsh tenor regaling passersby. It's none other than the famous Jon Pertwee, guest-starring as the tenor-cum-guide who boasts knowledge of the lost mine. Act 1: A Quirky Quest Pertwee, decked out in flamboyant Welsh garb and a voice that echoes through the valleys, swaggers into the Goodies' lives, promising grand adventure. Pertwee (singing grandly): \\"Follow me, brave lads, both loyal and fine, to seek the riches of Blaneau's lost mine!\\" Montage: The Goodies prepare for their quest, donning hard hats with little torches on top and investing in a range of ludicrous mining equipment, including jet-powered pickaxes and an oversized geological hammer for Tim. Act 2: Journey into the Unknown With Pertwee leading the way and singing about the glories of Wales, the Goodies trek through lush valleys and over mist-covered hills. They encounter zany obstacles: a sheep traffic jam, a druidic ceremony that they must dance through, and a suspiciously Welsh-sounding dragon that turns out to be a cleverly disguised steam train. Bill (exasperated): \\"This is less like a treasure hunt and more like a village fête on legs.\\" Tim (determined, clutching his map): \\"Onward! The mine calls out to us!\\" Act 3: The Mine Revealed They finally arrive at the supposed location of the lost mine, a nondescript hill with no entrance in sight. Pertwee dramatically swings his leek-shaped baton, and the hillside reveals a hidden entrance. Inside, the Goodies navigate a labyrinth of caverns, all the while Pertwee sings echoing arias, accidentally triggering cave-ins and stalactite showers. As they make their way deeper, they discover not slate but a trove of old Welsh artifacts—rusty miner's lamps, dusty hats, and ancient tea sets—worth more in cultural value than any slate hoard. Tim (reverently): \\"We've not found slate, but we’ve uncovered history!\\" Bill (sarcastically): \\"Oh good, we can pay the rent in antiques and tenor trills.\\" Pertwee (wistfully): \\"Ah, but the true treasure was our journey through the heart of Wales.\\" Closing Scene: As they emerge back into daylight, Pertwee takes center stage atop the hillside, broadcasting their discovery to the valley below. Pertwee (belting out a song): \\"We came for slate but found much more, the spirit of Wales we did adore!\\" The Goodies watch on proudly, with Bill reluctantly joining in the chorus. Despite no monetary gain, their adventure has rekindled a love for Welsh heritage and maybe inspired an operatic musical based on their exploits. Cue the Goodies theme tune with a Welsh twist, as the end credits roll over scenic Welsh landscapes and comedic snapshots of their bumbling exploration.

Tim and Bill rush over, leaving a more careful Graeme to gather his extraterrestrial detection kit. Peering into the crater, Tim and Bill are awestruck as a mysterious figure emerges from the mist—Mog the Martian. In reality, several stray cats covered in soot from the impact site are scrambling out, causing a series of peculiar shadows that play tricks on the eyes of the beholders. Tim (excitedly): \\"We have to catch it! For science... and interplanetary friendship!\\" Bill (grabbing a butterfly net): \\"And the tabloids, don't forget the tabloids.\\" Act 2: The Mog Phenomenon The chase is on. Tim and Bill pursue the frisky felines through the park, causing a slapstick spectacle. Graeme, meanwhile, scrutinizes the crater, swiftly deducing the shooting star's terrestrial origins, but his logical explanations fall on deaf ears. The \\"Martian\\" is eventually cornered and wrapped in Tim's Union Jack, revealing just a bundle of disgruntled, soot-covered cats. Yet the media frenzy has taken hold, with everyone convinced that The Goodies have made first contact. Graeme (exasperated): \\"You realize that's not an alien, right? It's just an ordinary—\\" Tim (interrupting): \\"Mog the Martian! The first ambassador of the Feline Federation!\\" Bill (smirking): \\"Yeah, and I'm the King of Venus.\\" Act 3: Starry Mishap As Mog becomes a sensation, paraded about on talk shows and public events, Graeme works tirelessly to expose the truth. Tim, meanwhile, has taken to dressing Mog in tiny space suits and teaching it to wave for the cameras. The climax arrives during a grand event in Mog's honor, where a band of more cleanly stray cats interrupts the ceremony, looking remarkably alike. Their entrance sends Mog into a frenzy, causing it to flee the stage, pursued by the Goodies and eventually diving into a pond with a dramatic splash. The onlookers are stunned as the cats emerge soaked but unmistakably terrestrial, washing away Tim and Bill's claims in the process. Closing Scene: The Goodies, drenched and slightly chastened, sit on the edge of the pond, watching the cats contentedly drying off in the sun. Graeme (dryly): \\"Well, the alien invasion turned out to be a bit of a damp squib.\\" Bill (wiping his face): \\"At least we made the front page.

Think of the multitasking potential!\\" Tim (laughing): \\"What are you going to do, play it with your mind?\\" Graeme, ever the inventor, strokes his chin and retreats to his lab with an air of conspiracy. Act 1: The Birth of the Brass Theremin Graeme emerges hours later, brandishing his creation—a strange concoction of brass tubing, antennae, and wires: the Brass Theremin. It's a trombone that responds to hand movements without physical contact. Graeme (proudly): \\"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the future of music! Or at least a noisy, brass part of it.\\" Montage: Inspired by Graeme's creation, the Goodies organize a concert tour, promising a musical experience unlike any other. They print posters of Tim adorned in Mozart-like garb beside a mystified Bill controlling the Brass Theremin with exaggerated gestures. Act 2: Concerto for Hands and Hypnosis During their inaugural concert, something bizarre occurs. As Bill waves his hands to produce surreal trombone sounds, the audience slips into a trance.

Graeme (horrified): \\"I didn’t mean to create a hypnotic instrument, I swear!\\" Act 3: Harmonious Mayhem Realizing Graeme's invention has the power to control minds, the Goodies are at odds about what to do. Tim sees potential for solving world issues, while Bill worries about the ethics. Graeme insists they must dismantle the Brass Theremin before things get out of hand. Their next concert sees the Brass Theremin's influence grow even stronger. Entire neighborhoods start performing musical flash mobs and sculpting statues of the Goodies after Tim's offhand quip about preserving the arts. Graeme (frantic): \\"This has gone too far! We need to stop playing that... thing.\\" Final Scene: The Goodies attempt to end the Theremin's spell by staging a 'reverse concert', hoping to undo the hypnosis. Graeme fiddles with the wiring, crossing his fingers for an anti-hypnotic melody. Instead, the Brass Theremin bursts into song all on its own, leading to its dramatic demise.

It's the esteemed Patrick Moore, guest star and famed astronomer, seeking the Goodies' help for an astronomical outreach event. Act 1: Romantic Reflections Inspired by Tim's romantic notions about the moon and Patrick Moore's enthusiasm for astronomy, Graeme concocts a whimsical plan. Graeme (excitedly): \\"What if we could bring the moon's romance to everyone? Lunar mirrors in parks, reflecting moonlight for lovers!\\" Tim (clapping his hands): \\"Brilliant! The Goodies' Guide to Galactic Romance!\\" Bill (eyeing Graeme suspiciously): \\"Are you sure you're a scientist?\\" Montage: The montage showcases the Goodies manufacturing giant mirrors and installing them in parks. Couples flock to the parks as The Goodies, now self-proclaimed \\"Ambassadors of Amour,\\" begin promoting their moonlit utopias. Act 2: Shine On, Harvest Moon The parks are transformed into night time wonderlands, bathed in reflected moonlight. Patrick Moore, donning a tuxedo, lends his voice to narrate the evening sky, adding a touch of class to the escapade. Amidst the wonder, however, problems arise. Misaligned mirrors start reflecting moonlight into bedroom windows, keeping half the city awake. Owls and bats begin acting strangely, disoriented by the amplified nocturnal glow. Graeme (frantically adjusting mirrors): \\"Slight miscalculation, nothing we can't fix!\\" Bill (holding a sleep mask): \\"Or we could just sell these as 'Moonlight Blockout Blinds' instead!\\" Act 3: Cosmic Chaos The Goodies' romantic intentions soon spiral into lunar madness. Enthused park-goers start behaving like werewolves, inspired by the overabundance of moonlight. Tim (dressed as Cupid, complete with wings and bow): \\"Maybe we've overdone it a wee bit?\\" As the city descends into lunacy, Graeme and Bill rush to realign the mirrors. Patrick Moore attempts to calm the crowds with soothing space facts, to little avail. Final Scene: The Goodies, racing against time, finally manage to tilt the mirrors up towards the sky, creating a spectacular light show reminiscent of the Northern Lights. The public, mesmerized by the unexpected display, forgets their nocturnal frolics and stands united in awe. Patrick Moore, visually impressed, shakes hands with the Goodies as newfound heroes of astronomy. Tim (proudly): \\"See? Who says romance and science don't mix?\\" Bill (rubbing his eyes): \\"Yeah, but next time, let's stick to candlelight, eh?\\" The scene closes with the Goodies joining couples in the park, watching the celestial ballet above—a harmonious blend of moonlight, mirrors, and mayhem.

Tim dreams up a stunning ribbon-cutting ceremony, while Bill scavenges for bargains on steel wire. Montage: The construction begins with the Goodies leading a mix of volunteers, while a curious crowd gathers to watch the spectacle of the 'string' being strung across the gorge. Bill keeps costs down by repurposing materials, Tim offers motivational speeches, and Graeme supervises the complex physics of string tension. Act 2: The High-Strung Bridge Against all odds, and through a series of comical trial and error, the String Bridge takes shape, looking remarkably like a giant guitar laid across the gorge. Test runs involve sending a nervous Bill across with various weighted objects, including an anvil and a grand piano. Tim (anxiously watching): \\"It's holding!

After that list all character goals that fail these criteria and brainstorm 3 variants of refined goal with added criteria. Relevant and time-bound criteria are less important and can be more vague (or hinted). <background> <setting> The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. Genre: fantasy plus romantic drama. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> <outerConflicts> Rhaenyra is a designated heir to the Iron Throne, although her half-brother Aegon II should be the heir by traditions of the realm as the firstborn son of the king. Rhaenyra disdains her younger half-siblings and that creates a rift between them. Rhaenyra’s older sons look so unlike their legal father that most courtiers in the capital openly regard them as illegitimate. Seeking a meaningful relationship, she chose a man she could trust and love (Harwin). However, her older sons' appearance clearly indicates their illegitimacy. Rhaenyra left the capital six years ago, avoiding rumors about her older sons’ bastardy, therefore, she lost influence and allies at the court. Rhaenyra’s younger brother Aemond lost his eye in the fight with Luke and he holds a huge grudge against him and her. Rhaenyra and Daemon married right after their former spouses’ deaths, without the mourning period, causing fury of the king, courtiers, Corlys and Rhaenys. Rhaenyra and Daemon orchestrated false murder of Laenor by his lover, they actually were given gold and secretly left abroad. It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement. Rhaenyra is generally happy with Daemon, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. </outerConflicts> <secondaryCharacters> <character name= “Lucerys” nickname= “Luke” age= “14”> Prince, second son of Rhaenyra and Laenor, great-nephew of Daemon.

As the Accessibility Center of Excellence (ACoE), it is our responsibility to ensure that requests are valid, authentic, and handled promptly, keeping in mind our commitment to accessibility. The following steps must be followed meticulously. Internal Process # Step 1 - Validate Request Upon receiving a deferment request form, validate all details. Assure that the information is complete and comprehensible. # Step 2 - Clarity of Request Examine the request for clarity. It must precisely detail the accessibility compliance issues encountered and the reasons why they cannot be resolved before the product release. # Step 3 - Valid Grounds Evaluate the validity of the grounds presented in the deferment request. This could be based on technical limitations, third-party dependencies, or unforeseen complications. # Step 4 - Deferment Escalation If the project team fails to meet the deferred deadline, ACoE must have an escalation process in place. This procedure should define when and to whom within ACoE or higher management the issue should be escalated. # Step 5 - Handling of Requests Currently, requests are to be managed by the designated ACoE member with expertise in project management and compliance. Upon recruitment of an admin person, the process should include a handoff procedure for ongoing and future requests. External Process # Step 6 - Communication with Requester Determine communication channels (email, phone calls, ticketing system) for keeping in touch with the requester. # Step 7 - Communication Timelines Set clear timelines for when the ACoE will respond to the requester, providing updates or requesting further information as needed. # Step 8 - Service Level Agreement (SLA) Establish an SLA to manage the project team’s expectations, which defines response times, processing times, and expected resolution times for requests. # Step 9 - Communicating Deferment Status Communicate acceptance, rejection, or need for additional information to the requester using pre-established channels. # Step 10 - Receipt of Deferment Request Upon receipt of a deferment request, ACoE will send an acknowledgment of receipt and begin the validation process. # Step 11 - Issues with the Request If there is an issue with the request, such as incomplete or unclear information, correspond with the requester promptly for clarification or additional information. # Step 12 - Completion of Deferment Request Once a deferment request is completed, communicate the resolution to the requester, noting any conditions or follow-ups required. Set a follow-up date or milestone check-in. # Step 13 - Acceptance Conditions Define specific conditions under which a deferment request can be accepted, e.g., no viable alternative, short-term issue, plan for resolution is in place, etc. # Step 14 - Rejection Conditions Clearly articulate circumstances that would lead to the rejection of a deferment request, such as non-reasonable justification, lack of efforts to resolve the issue, or impact on user experience. Conclusion The ACoE's guide to managing accessibility deferment requests ensures a structured approach to evaluating and processing these requests effectively. It is essential to maintain clear communication, transparency, and accountability throughout the process to balance the necessity for product delivery with the unwavering commitment to accessibility. Remember that accessibility deferments are exceptions and not the rule. They should be leveraged cautiously to uphold Royal London’s reputation for inclusive products and services. Proper documentation of every step taken in this guide will also be vital for internal records and potential audits."},{"prompt":"Now expand each step in detail.","completion":"# Expanded Accessibility Deferment Guide for ACoE Introduction This guide is designed to assist the Accessibility Center of Excellence (ACoE) in managing and processing accessibility deferment requests in a way that is thorough, fair, and in alignment with organizational accessibility objectives. Internal Detailed Process # Step 1 - Validate Request **Procedure:** 1. Review the request form upon submission for completion and correctness. 2. Check against a checklist to ensure all necessary information, such as product details, specifics of non-conformance, and anticipated remediation plan, is provided. 3. Verify submission includes sufficient evidence that supports the need for deferment. 4. Log the request into a tracking system with a unique identifier for future tracking. # Step 2 - Clarity of Request **Procedure:** 1. Assess whether the request articulates which WCAG standards cannot be met and why. 2. Ensure the explanation provided is technically sound and logically explains the barrier to immediate compliance. 3. Determine if the language is precise and devoid of vague terms that could lead to differing interpretations. # Step 3 - Valid Grounds **Procedure:** 1. Review the reasons for deferment against a predefined set of valid criteria, looking for technical feasibility, third-party constraints, etc. 2. Evaluate the potential impact on users with disabilities if the deferment is granted. 3. Conduct a risk assessment to investigate potential harm to the company’s reputation or legal implications. # Step 4 - Deferment Escalation **Procedure:** 1. Establish timelines within which progress must be shown. 2. Set up alerts or reminders to monitor the progress as the deadline approaches. 3. Define a clear escalation chain including specific roles within ACoE and executive management where necessary. 4. Document and escalate any failure to meet deferment obligations according to plan. # Step 5 - Handling of Requests **Procedure:** 1.

Also, can you provide the flowchart diagram of the same?","completion":"Creating a detailed process and illustrating a flowchart diagram involves extensive information which may not be feasible to deliver through this platform. However, I can guide you through an even more detailed process and describe the elements that would be necessary for a flowchart. Detailed Internal Process # Step 1 - Validate Request **Procedure:** 1. Implement initial automated confirmation signalling that the request has been received and is pending review. 2. Create a detailed checklist, ensuring that all parts of the form are filled out, including project identification, contact information, specific WCAG criteria affected, understandable explanation of issues, and an expected timeline for achieving compliance. 3. Assign a case number for reference and track the form's progression through various stages. # Step 2 - Clarity of Request **Procedure:** 1. Establish a grading system to rank the clarity of the request (e.g. clear, unclear, requires minor clarification) and assign specific actions for each grade. 2. Determine if the deferment request describes the context within which the non-conformances occur, including impacts on different types of users. 3. Designate a team for evaluating the technical and functional aspects of the request to assure their understanding before moving forward. # Step 3 - Valid Grounds **Procedure:** 1. Develop a matrix that correlates the grounds for deferment with acceptable reasons as per company policy. 2. Conduct a panel review with members from different disciplines within ACoE to approach the validity of a request from various points of view. 3. Involve legal counsel if necessary to assess any compliance risks or precedent concerns. # Step 4 - Deferment Escalation **Procedure:** 1. Integrate an automated alert system for timeline tracking to notify BEFORE a project is overdue, allowing time for proactive measures. 2. Create an escalation pathway document, with contacts listed in order of the chain of command, and protocols for different levels of escalation. 3. Script standardized communication templates for use during the escalation process. # Step 5 - Handling of Requests **Procedure:** 1. Compile a dossier for each case owner in ACoE, equipping them with all information and history on the request. 2. Organize a training session for a newly appointed admin person to understand their role in the deferment process. 3. Document transition procedures thoroughly, including timelines and responsibilities for the handover period. Detailed External Process # Step 6 - Communication with Requester **Procedure:** 1. Include a section in the request form where the project team can fill out their preferred times and channels for communications. 2. Ensure an ACoE member is assigned to reply within a pre-determined timeframe, setting the standard for future correspondences. # Step 7 - Communication Timelines **Procedure:** 1. Establish automated update dispatches on the case's status at set intervals, with additional manual updates for significant developments. 2. Set up a calendar with all key dates and share access with stakeholders to ensure visibility and transparency. # Step 8 - Service Level Agreement (SLA) **Procedure:** 1. Craft a comprehensive SLA document that details every processing step and what the project team can expect. 2. Define clear metrics that will be used to measure compliance with the SLA and disclose this to all parties involved. # Step 9 - Communicating Deferment Status **Procedure:** 1. Use a centralized communication log accessible by both ACoE and the project team that records all communication for accountability. 2. Have a strategy in place for urgent communications that may require immediate attention or action by the project team. # Step 10 - Receipt of Deferment Request **Procedure:** 1. Sync this with a managed database or project management software to ensure all team members have visibility on new requests and their status. # Step 11 - Issues with the Request **Procedure:** 1. Provide the project team with a detailed questionnaire or structured interview to gather missing or unclear information. 2. Create a collaborative workspace or document where issues and subsequent clarifications can be dynamically worked on by both parties. # Step 12 - Completion of Deferment Request **Procedure:** 1. Include in communications the next steps for the project team post-resolution, detailing any follow-up reviews or compliance checks due in the future. 2. Enter completion status into all tracking systems and ensure stakeholders are notified. # Step 13 - Acceptance Conditions **Procedure:** 1. Create a decision tree that assesses the acceptability of the request against predetermined criteria, including feedback loops for additional information as needed. 2. Design sign-off protocol requiring consensus from key ACoE members to accept a request. # Step 14 - Rejection Conditions **Procedure:** 1. Outline clear pathways for resubmission or appeal, providing guidance and support for project teams to improve their compliance status. 2. Detail the documentation that will be provided to justify a rejection, ensuring complete transparency. Flowchart Diagram Creation To create a flowchart based on the described process: 1. Use a flowchart tool or software that allows for the detailed creation and manipulation of decision trees and processes (e.g., Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio, draw.io). 2. Start with a Start node that signifies the beginning of the process. 3. Branch out with decision nodes (diamond shapes) that correspond to the steps where the ACoE decides if a request is clear, valid, and if it should be accepted or rejected. 4. Use rectangles for process steps that describe actions to be taken, such as \\"Validate Request\\" or \\"Communicate with Requester.\\" 5. Affix parallelograms for input/output procedures, like receiving the deferment request form or sending communication to the project team. 6. Implement circles for connectors when the flowchart spans multiple pages or loops back to a previous step. 7. Connect the symbols with arrows that map the process flow from one step to the next, incorporating lines that split from the decision nodes to different outcomes. 8. Conclude with an End node that signifies the end of the deferment process. A complex, multi-stage process like this would result in an intricate flowchart that should then be reviewed for accuracy and user-friendliness. Try to strike a balance between detail and clarity, ensuring the flowchart is a practical tool for any team member to follow."},{"prompt":"Continue","completion":"# Step 15 - Documenting the Flowchart **Procedure:** 1. Ensure all actions and decisions within the flowchart are labelled clearly and concisely, matching the terminology used in this guide for consistency. 2. Use color coding to separate the internal process from the external process, making it easy for team members to distinguish between the steps that involve interactions with the project team. 3. Add legends or explanatory notes to clarify symbols and color schemes. # Step 16 - Review and Testing **Procedure:** 1. Once the flowchart has been created, conduct a thorough review with team members who will use it in practice, gathering feedback on its usability and comprehensibility. 2. Test the flowchart by running through several deferment request scenarios to ensure that every possible outcome is covered and that the process flows logically. # Step 17 - Making Improvements **Procedure:** 1. Based on feedback and outcomes from testing, make necessary adjustments to the flowchart for clarity, process optimization, and to seal any gaps. 2. Ensure that there is a version control system in place so that updates to the flowchart are tracked and the most current version is easily identifiable and accessible. # Step 18 - Training and Distribution **Procedure:** 1. Train ACoE members and stakeholders on using the flowchart properly, highlighting any areas that are especially complex or have undergone recent changes. 2. Distribute the flowchart to all relevant parties, providing digital access through common shared platforms or intranet. # Step 19 - Monitoring and Continuous Improvement **Procedure:** 1. Monitor the effectiveness of the flowchart in guiding the deferment process, and gather continuous feedback for improvements. 2. Schedule regular reviews to ensure the flowchart remains up-to-date with any policy changes, legal requirements, or alterations in internal procedures. Considerations for the Flowchart Diagram When constructing the flowchart diagram, consider the following: - **Breakdown**: Create sub-flowcharts for steps that are particularly complex. This will avoid clutter and enhance understanding. - **Accessibility**: Make sure that the flowchart is accessible, with alternative text for images and logical reading order for those using screen readers. - **Interactive Elements**: In digital versions, consider using interactive elements that allow users to click on parts of the flowchart to get more information or tips on each step. - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Incorporate mechanisms or channels through which staff can report issues or suggest improvements to the flowchart. - **Integration**: Evaluate if the flowchart can be integrated with project management tools or compliance software for automated tracking and notifications. Ultimately, the key to a successful flowchart diagram for the accessibility deferment process is clarity, comprehensiveness, and ease of use. By carefully constructing this visual tool, you create a valuable asset for the ACoE and the wider organization, promoting a consistent and effective approach to managing accessibility challenges. **Note**: Due to the textual nature of this platform, I'm unable to create a graphic flowchart. For actual implementation, you would need to utilize flowchart software as described in the process above."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Please edit the following text using a natural tone while maintaining the original author’s voice: Now, I want to show you that in learning. Till now that was one stage. I will now make you work a little bit. So let's push. I may push you a little bit. So now we go on further. It goes like this. This place where the K’dusheh is chal makes you approach the endeavor, the Mesima, in a way that it could be chal. You have to be prepared that it should be able to be hal. You have to be prepared for that. It's not that it's not automatically happening. For example, by this Tayves A'chilleh, that's very simple. When you are approaching your food with the excitement of your Tayves A'chilleh, that's the wrong approach because then this won't be happening. It can't reveal itself. Thats what we spoke. But now in Mitzves or in Torah, that's more tricky. I show you what it means to learn Torah with Yiras Shomayim, that Yiras Shomayim makes you approach your learning in a way that Chochmeh of the Borei Olam is able to reveal itself. So now I will bring you an example. Perhaps now you will hook off. That could be. Because a lot of times I see that when you go into a second floor, then the people don't like that, they stay with the first floor. They still enjoy the first floor. It's a push. I push you a little bit. Never mind. You have a brain for thinking, Let's use that a little bit. So what's going on? How do you, how do you, how do you have Yiras Shomayim Benogeah Le'Limud Torah? What does it mean? I will give the negative picture out of my own life. I will show you how I do not have any Yiras Shomayim Benogeah Le'Limud Torah.And then that will be clear for you. What does it mean Yiras Shomayim Benogeah Le'Limud Torah? But I tell you how I am approaching a thing without any Yiras Shomayim. I approach Torah, I learn Torah without any Yiras Shomayim. That doesn’t mean that I learn Torah and I smoke on Shabbos. No, because then the smoking on Shabbos is not related to how I approach Torah. No, I approach Torah without Yiras Shomayim. What does it mean? I personally have a very strong koyach HaDimyon, of imagination. So this koyach HaTziur is not about drawing, rather of illustrating and connecting disparate concepts, and it functions like this in Ruchnius as well, that the last idea I have can be always relevant to the next idea. The Bochurim in Chevron where I was the Mashgiach knew that, and when they wanted to influence me, then a few moments before the va’ad they spoke to me. And then I would most probably mention something about that in the va’ad, because that's the way I can do it. I have a good enough head, and I have a strong enough imagination that I can imagine how, how everything is shayech to everything. For me the last idea is the most koveah, I can do that. So now I can do it in Torah too. I can sit down and they think about the topic, and then I have some idea coming up from my stomach, or from somewhere, but not Min HaShomayim - that’s for sure. I just come up with some idea. And suddenly I see, with this idea I will understand the topic very well. And then I make a construct of this idea together with the topic, and then I feel like it’s all mameish Min HaShomayim. That's what it's called, learning Torah without Yiras Shomayim, you learn Torah with your own intuition only. Even though you do learn Torah. But you don't prepare yourself that I have to get what the Borei Olam wants, not what I want. Now, it's not only me suffering from that. There are a lot of names which could be mentioned, you know, from younger people, who are suffering from exactly the same thing. And they don't see that. They think, I'm a Ba’al Kishren, it’s mamesh a siata di’shmayeh the way I think. It’s no siata di’shmayeh, it’s simply a complete lack of Yiras Shomayim, because you don't approach your learning with the mudaot, with the awareness that I have to get what the Borei Olam wanted in here. But you say “My idea really fits well with the sugyeh!” That might be true, but it's still your idea which comes up. The Sugyeh perhaps says a different thing. And now you see how Yiras Shomayim is the place of learning Torah. You have to prepare a place by you that the Chochme from the Borei Olam om to be able to reveal itself by you. But you have to prepare a place. It's your responsibility, and it's your hachoneh. You have to prepare yourself that you should not go for your own idea. I'm going for revealing what the Borei Olam wants. That's a big work. That's a tremendous work. And you have to get rid of this own negieh, of impulsion towards your own ideas. R’ Yisroel says, even though in the end you will understand with your own seychel and with your own middos, but that it's only after you work like a mad man to get rid of all the negiehs. You can't approach it like that from the onset. That's what it means.","completion":"Beloved talmidim, I wish to take you on a deeper journey in our avodas ha’limud. Until now, we have been engaged in one level of study. It is time to raise the bar, to increase our efforts. We should be prepared to exert ourselves further in this holy endeavor. Consider where the sanctity is activated; it requires us to approach our learning, our mesima, with intentionality and preparation. It does not occur by itself. Take, for example, the desire for eating, the ta'avah of achilah. When one approaches their meal purely driven by this ta'avah, the potential for holiness cannot manifest. It's concealed. This was our previous discussion. In contrast, the domain of mitzvos and Torah study is much more nuanced. Let me show you what it means to learn Torah with yiras Shamayim. True yiras Shamayim guides our learning so that the Divine Wisdom can unfurl and become illuminated through our study. I'll now illustrate an example, which might be a departure from our usual level – a step onto the \\"second floor,\\" so to speak. Sometimes, we find comfort in the familiar \\"first floor,\\" but growth requires us to ascend. Though it may be challenging, remember, we possess the capacity for deep thought. Let's embrace it. So, what does it mean to learn Torah with yiras Shamayim? I offer my personal experience to depict the contrast. I'll first demonstrate how one can study Torah without any sense of yiras Shamayim. I've been blessed with a vivid imagination, a strong koach hadimyon. In Chevron, where I served as Mashgiach, the bochurim knew this. If they spoke to me shortly before a va'ad, it was likely I would reference their topic. My ability to connect ideas is robust; the most recent concept often prevails in my thoughts. This capability extends to my Torah study. I might consider a subject and an idea springs forth—not divinely inspired, but from within me. This concept seemingly clarifies the topic at hand, and I might construct an understanding that feels authentic, as if it came from Shamayim. But this is the very essence of learning Torah without yiras Shamayim: relying solely on one's intuition. One wrongly presumes that understanding Torah means accommodating one's own ideas rather than earnestly seeking the Divine intention. This struggle is not unique to me. Many, especially the young, fall into this trap, mistaking their personal insights for siyata d'Shmaya. True siyata d'Shmaya requires a humble approach to learning. You must aim to receive the Torah as Hashem intended, not to project your interpretations onto it. Even if your thinking seems to align with the sugya, it remains your interpretation, which may diverge from the Torah's true message. Yiras Shamayim is thus foundational to learning Torah. We must consciously prepare to be receptacles for Hashem's Wisdom. It is our responsibility to strive not for self-validation but for the revelation of Hashem's will within Torah. This is not an easy task; it is formidable work. To truly succeed, we must dispel any bias towards our reasoning. As R’ Yisroel Salanter teaches, understanding Torah with our intellect and middos is only legitimate after laborious effort to remove personal biases. We cannot approach Torah study with preconceptions; that is the essence of our avodah. May we merit to learn with yiras Shamayim, inviting the chochmah of the Borei Olam to illuminate our hearts and minds. Wishing you continued growth in Torah and yiras Shamayim, Your dedicated rabbi and scholar"},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

This perspective is usually associated with Unitarianism or other non-Trinitarian Christian beliefs, which hold that God is one being and that Jesus is distinct from God. Here are 15 verses that are often cited, along with brief explanations of the interpretations used: 1. Mark 10:18 - \\"Why do you call me good?\\" Jesus answered. \\"No one is good—except God alone.\\" Explanation: Jesus makes a distinction between himself and God, suggesting that the inherent goodness is reserved for God alone. 2. Mark 13:32 - \\"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\\" Explanation: Jesus acknowledges that he does not have the same knowledge as the Father, indicating a difference in omniscience. 3. John 14:28 - \\"You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.\\" Explanation: Jesus speaks of the Father as greater than himself, suggesting a hierarchical difference between them. 4. Matthew 27:46 - \\"About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?' (which means 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?').\\" Explanation: Jesus addresses God as distinct from himself, indicating a separate identity. 5. 1 Corinthians 8:6 - \\"Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.\\" Explanation: The verse differentiates between one God, the Father, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, which might imply that they are not the same being. 6. 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 - \\"Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. ... When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.\\" Explanation: Jesus is depicted as subjecting himself to God the Father in the end, indicating a subordinate role. 7. John 5:30 - \\"By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.\\" Explanation: Jesus speaks of his dependence on God the Father, showing he does not act with complete autonomy as God would. 8. John 20:17 - \\"Jesus said, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’'\\" Explanation: Jesus refers to the Father as \\"my God,\\" distinguishing his relationship with the Father as that of a son to a god, not as an equal part of a triune God. 9. Acts 2:22 - \\"Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.\\" Explanation: Peter refers to Jesus as a man through whom God did miraculous works, which might imply that Jesus is not God himself. 10. 1 Timothy 2:5 - \\"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus.\\" Explanation: Jesus is presented as a mediator between God and humans, not as God himself. 11. Colossians 1:15 - \\"The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.\\" Explanation: Jesus is described as the \\"image\\" of God, suggesting a representation rather than being God in essence. 12. Matthew 4:10 - \\"Then Jesus said to him, 'Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.''\\" Explanation: Jesus quotes Deuteronomy, reinforcing the command to serve God alone, not Jesus himself. 13. Acts 3:13-15 - \\"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus.\\" Explanation: Peter refers to Jesus as God's servant, which some might argue implies Jesus is not God but rather a chosen human. 14. John 17:3 - \\"Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\\" Explanation: Jesus makes a distinction between knowing the \\"only true God\\" and knowing himself as the one sent by God. 15. Luke 18:19 - \\"Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.'\\" Explanation: As with Mark 10:18, this verse is cited to show Jesus distinguishing himself from God by denying the designation \\"good\\" for himself. It is crucial to recognize that interpretations of these verses vary widely among different Christian denominations. Trinitarian Christians, who believe that God is three co-eternal persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), interpret these and other verses in a manner consistent with their understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity. Those discussions involve complex theological debate and deeply rooted scriptural interpretation strategies."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle processing, you would specifically look for agents that can be easily pyrolyzed at temperatures that don’t affect the TiO2 structure. Here are some suitable candidates that fall within this criterion: 1. Protein-based Agents: - Gelatin: Used as a fining agent in winemaking to help clarify liquids, it burns off cleanly but may require relatively high temperatures to ensure complete combustion. - Casein: A milk protein that can be used as a fining agent, similar to gelatin. It requires complete burning off to avoid residual carbon. 2. Polysaccharides: - Alginate and Chitosan: While these are not typically volatile, they can be incinerated at high temperatures to leave minimal residue provided there is a sufficient oxygen supply. 3. Volatile Organic Compounds: - Ethanol and Isopropanol: Alcohols can promote flocculation (though not strongly) and are easily evaporated without leaving residues. They are not typically used as primary flocculating agents but can alter the solution properties to aid sedimentation. They combust completely to carbon dioxide and water with sufficient oxygen. - Acetone: Another substance that can alter the dispersion stability of nanoparticles and is fully volatile. Acetone is not a traditional flocculant but might be used to modify solvent properties to aid in particle settling. 4. Organic Acids: - Acetic Acid and Formic Acid: While primarily serving as pH adjusters rather than strong flocculants, they are both volatile and can be completely burned off. 5. Enzymatic Agents: - Lysozyme: Used for lysing bacterial cell walls in winemaking, it is a protein that can burn off at high temperatures, similar to gelatin and casein. When pyrolyzing these substances, it is crucial to conduct the process in an oxygen-rich environment to ensure complete combustion and avoid the formation of char or residual carbon. The temperatures must be sufficiently high to combust the organic material but not so high as to sinter or otherwise alter the TiO2 nanoparticles. It’s also important to consider that if the selected agent is not traditionally used as a flocculant, its ability to induce flocculation might be limited, and thus additional measures may be required to aid the settling process. The agents selected must also be appropriate for the end-use of the TiO2 nanoparticles. For example, any substance introduced to a system meant for medical or food-related applications must be non-toxic and approved for such use, even if it will be removed later. Each substance will have its own effectiveness and practicality based on its chemical properties and the specific conditions of the nanoparticle suspension, so testing and optimization are key to finding the best solution for your application. As always, thorough characterization after treatment is needed to ensure purity and lack of contamination. this is where we got to , and i asked which method you would say is the better of the options , for example maybe you'll say an acid is better because it can be evaporated off and it does the trick well","completion":"The ideal fining agent or flocculant to use for processing TiO2 nanoparticles will depend on various factors, including the specific requirements of the process, the desired purity of the final product, and the equipment and conditions available for processing. If the goal is to have the least amount of residual carbon or other substances left behind after burning off the agent, you may want to prioritize agents that are volatile and can easily be turned to gas without leaving residue. Here's my take on the options mentioned: 1. **Protein-based Agents (Gelatin, Casein):** While effective, they require high temperatures to ensure complete combustion, and there is a risk of carbon residue if not fully burnt off. These might not be the best option when aiming for minimal residual carbon. 2. **Polysaccharides (Alginate, Chitosan):** These can also be effective, but again there is a risk of incomplete combustion and carbon residue. They may require even higher temperatures than proteins for complete incineration. 3. **Volatile Organic Compounds (Ethanol, Isopropanol, Acetone):** These are more likely to combust completely to carbon dioxide and water, leaving no residue, making them a good choice in terms of leaving behind minimal carbon. However, they are not strong flocculants on their own and might need to be used in conjunction with other agents to achieve the desired flocculation effect. 4. **Organic Acids (Acetic Acid, Formic Acid):** As they are also volatile and evaporate easily, these acids can be fully removed by combustion, provided the temperature is well controlled to avoid overheating the TiO2. They aren't typically used as flocculants, but they can be helpful for pH adjustment, which may indirectly aid flocculation. 5. **Enzymatic Agents (Lysozyme):** Enzymes like these can be burned off, but they may not be suitable or effective as flocculants for TiO2 nanoparticle processing. Based on the criteria of leaving the least amount of residual carbon or substances, volatile organic compounds or organic acids seem to be the better options. They can be completely removed by evaporation or combustion and are less likely to leave carbonaceous residue compared to proteins or polysaccharides. Ethanol, Isopropanol, and Acetone, while not traditionally used as flocculants, could be beneficial in altering the solution properties to aid in particle settling. Their volatility also makes them attractive for complete removal without leaving residue. Organic acids like Acetic Acid and Formic Acid can be attractive as well due to their volatility and complete combustion to CO2 and water, but their role as flocculants is limited. Ultimately, the \\"best\\" choice would depend on the system's tolerance for residual substances, the effectiveness of the agent in inducing flocculation or aiding in the sedimentation of nanoparticles, and any regulatory or purity constraints related to the end-use application of the TiO2. It would be advisable to conduct experiments to determine the effectiveness and residue profile of each candidate in the specific conditions of the TiO2 processing system."},{"prompt":"here's an idea , just an idea , i wondered if it could give us ideas ,, lol Abstract Purpose: To recover polymer-stabilized amorphous nanoparticles from aqueous dispersions efficiently by salt flocculation and to show that the particles redisperse and dissolve rapidly to produce highly supersaturated solutions. Methods: Nanoparticle dispersions of itraconazole stabilized by nonionic polymers were formed by antisolvent precipitation and immediately flocculated with sodium sulfate, filtered and dried. The size after redispersion in water, crystallinity, and morphology were compared with those for particles produced by spray drying and rapid freezing. Results: Particle drug loading increased to approximately 90% after salt flocculation and removal of excess polymer with the filtrate. The formation of the flocs at constant particle volume fraction led to low fractal dimensions (open flocs), which facilitated redispersion in water to the original primary particle size of approximately 300 nm. Amorphous particles, which were preserved throughout the flocculation-filtration-drying process, dissolved to supersaturation levels of up to 14 in pH 6.8 media. In contrast, both spray dried and rapidly frozen nanoparticle dispersions crystallized and did not produce submicron particle dispersions upon addition to water, nor high supersaturation values. Conclusions: Salt flocculation produces large yields of high surface area amorphous nanoparticle powders that de-aggregate and dissolve rapidly upon redispersion in pH 6.8 media, for supersaturation levels up to 14.","completion":"The abstract you provided outlines an interesting approach to processing amorphous nanoparticles, specifically to recover itraconazole nanoparticles stabilized by nonionic polymers. Salt flocculation as the method of choice for processing these nanoparticles is shown to be advantageous for several reasons: 1. **Efficiency**: Salt-induced flocculation appears to be efficient in recovering a high yield of nanoparticles from aqueous dispersions. 2. **Drug Loading**: The approach was successful in increasing the particle drug loading to approximately 90%, due to the removal of excess polymer through the filtration process. 3. **Preservation of Particle Size and Morphology**: The process facilitated the redispersion of the particles in water to their original primary size, indicating that the flocculation and filtration did not alter the size significantly. 4. **Preservation of Amorphous State**: Crucially, salt flocculation allowed the preservation of the amorphous state of the particles, which is typically desirable for increasing the solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. 5. **High Supersaturation**: As a result of maintaining the amorphous state, the particles dissolved rapidly upon redispersion and achieved high levels of supersaturation. From this study, we can draw parallels to the selection of flocculants for other purposes. The use of sodium sulfate in the flocculation process might not directly translate to processing TiO2 nanoparticles, but the underlying principles could inform the selection: - **Efficiency of Recovery**: Any flocculant used for processing nanoparticles should allow for efficient recovery of the particles without significant loss. - **Preservation of Desired Characteristics**: The process should not negatively impact the particle size distribution, surface area, or other critical material properties. - **Reversibility**: Ideally, the process should be reversible, allowing the particles to be easily redispersed to their primary size, especially if aggregation is undesirable. - **Suitability for End-Use**: The final product must fulfill the requirements for its intended application without introducing impurities that could compromise its performance or safety. While the idea of using a salt like sodium sulfate for flocculation is well-suited for certain organic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles such as TiO2 might require different considerations. For instance, TiO2 nanoparticles might be stable at a different range of pH values, require different flocculants to induce aggregation without surface modification, or need specific conditions to maintain their crystalline structure. The technique highlighted in the abstract emphasizes the importance of matching the flocculation method to the specific material and end-use requirements. The findings underscore that variation in the processing approach—like using salt flocculation versus spray drying or rapid freezing—can have significant impacts on the final product characteristics and performance. For TiO2 processing, a careful assessment of the flocculation agents and process conditions is necessary to ensure the final product quality."},{"prompt":"I guess the old way will be to simply evaporate the water to collect the particles , i know agglomeration is a thing but i'm not worrying about that just yet","completion":"Indeed, evaporating the water to collect particles is one of the simplest and most traditional methods of drying and recovering solid products from a solution or a suspension. This method, commonly referred to as \\"evaporative drying,\\" can involve different techniques including: 1. **Air Drying**: Exposing the suspension to air at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures to let the water evaporate naturally over time. 2. **Oven Drying**: Using a laboratory or industrial oven to heat the suspension, thus increasing the rate of water evaporation. 3. **Rotary Evaporation**: Using a rotary evaporator to reduce the pressure, thereby lowering the boiling point of the solvent and speeding up evaporation, often used for small volumes and sensitive materials. 4. **Spray Drying**: Atomizing the liquid into a hot gas stream to rapidly dry the droplets into fine powder particles. 5. **Freeze Drying (Lyophilization)**: Freezing the solution and then reducing the pressure to allow the frozen water to sublimate directly from ice to vapor. When considering the use of evaporative drying for nanoparticle recovery like TiO2, there are several advantages and potential challenges: **Advantages**: - Simplicity: It is a straightforward process requiring minimal technical complexity. - Scalability: Evaporative drying can be scaled from small laboratory setups to large industrial processes. - Purity: There is typically no need for additional chemicals or flocculants that could introduce impurities or residues. **Challenges**: - Agglomeration: As water evaporates, particles can come into closer contact and form agglomerates, which might be undesirable for certain applications. - Particle Damage: Some drying techniques, especially those involving heat, can damage sensitive particles or alter their properties (e.g., crystalline structure, surface characteristics). - Energy Cost: Evaporation, especially on a large scale, can be energy-intensive, which might be a consideration for the overall cost and environmental footprint of the process. Before choosing the evaporative drying method, it is crucial to consider the desired characteristics of the final dried product, the practicality of the drying method based on the amount of material to be processed, and the economic and environmental implications. If agglomeration is a concern, as you've mentioned, other steps might be necessary after drying, such as milling or sieving, to break down the agglomerates into individual nanoparticles or smaller aggregates. For your TiO2 nanoparticle processing, evaluating the performance and suitability of evaporative drying against other methods, and considering post-processing steps to address issues like agglomeration, will help ensure the production of a high-quality final product."},{"prompt":"if i do all processes before evaporation for example a heterojunction of tio2 and g-cn nanosheets , then a bit of agglomeration at the end isnt a huge issue","completion":"Yes, if you've already formed the heterojunction of TiO2 with g-C3N4 (graphitic carbon nitride) nanosheets prior to the evaporative drying step, a small degree of agglomeration during drying may not be a significant issue, depending on the intended application of your material. Heterojunctions often have a specific interface structure that is crucial for their performance, particularly in applications like photocatalysis, where the tight coupling between different materials can facilitate charge separation and transport. Agglomeration during the drying process can occur due to capillary forces as the liquid evaporates, bringing particles into closer contact. If the individual heterojunction units maintain their integrity and the agglomeration does not significantly disrupt the interaction between the TiO2 and g-C3N4 components, the functionality of the heterojunction might remain largely unaffected. However, consider the following points: - **Application Sensitivity**: Some applications may be more sensitive to particle size and distribution, such as those requiring a high surface area for catalytic reactions or uniform particle size for coatings. - **Degree of Agglomeration**: If agglomeration results in very large aggregates or non-uniform clumps, this could impact dispersibility, surface area, and ultimately the performance of the heterojunction. - **Post-processing Options**: If agglomeration turns out to be problematic, mild post-processing techniques, such as gentle milling or sonication, could be used to break up aggregates without damaging the heterojunction. - **Characterization**: Comprehensive characterization of the dried material is important to ascertain that the final product falls within acceptable levels of agglomeration and that the heterojunction structure is preserved. - **Processing Conditions**: Modifying the drying conditions (e.g., drying temperature, rate of evaporation, environmental humidity) can sometimes control the extent of agglomeration. - **Stabilization**: Sometimes, adding surface-stabilizing agents during or before the drying process can help to minimize agglomeration. However, this may not be desirable for all types of heterojunctions or if purity is a key concern. By considering your specific end-use requirements and the degree to which agglomeration may be tolerated, you can decide whether simple evaporative drying is sufficient or whether additional measures are needed. If the application allows for some degree of particle agglomeration and the functionality is preserved, evaporative drying can indeed be a suitable and cost-effective method for processing your nanomaterials."},{"prompt":"if nanoparticles have settled and stuck to the bottom of a container then i wonder if washing to remove anything else like for example boric acid . i wonder if washing can be done without the particles becoming in suspension again hmmmm ,,, also whilst on the subject does boric acid sublimate ?","completion":"Washing nanoparticles that have settled at the bottom of a container is a common practice to remove impurities or excess reactants from the synthesis process. To successfully wash the settled nanoparticles without resuspending them can be challenging, particularly if the particles are fine and easily disturbed. Here are some strategies that might be used: 1. **Decanting**: Carefully pour off the supernatant liquid without disturbing the settled particle layer. This can remove a large volume of the impurities or unwanted substances like boric acid without resuspending the particles. 2. **Careful Addition of Washing Fluid**: Add the wash liquid (often pure water or another solvent that does not dissolve the nanoparticles) gently to the side of the container or by drizzling it down a glass rod to minimize disturbance. 3. **Settling and Repeating**: Allow the nanoparticles to settle after each addition of wash liquid, then remove the supernatant and repeat the process until the wash liquid is free of impurities. 4. **Siphoning**: Use a siphon to remove the supernatant liquid without agitating the settled particles, enabling the wash liquid to be changed several times without disturbing the sediment. 5. **Centrifugation**: After washing, centrifugation can be used to quickly re-settle the particles if they become suspended. This technique offers a fast and effective way to separate the particles from the wash liquid. Now, regarding your second question: boric acid (H3BO3), under standard conditions, does not readily sublimate. Boric acid has a melting point of about 170.9°C and will typically decompose before reaching a temperature where it would sublimate significantly. At higher temperatures (above 300°C), boric acid can start to dehydrate to form metaboric acid (HBO2) and eventually tetraboric acid (H2B4O7) or other boron oxide species, but this decomposition does not equate to usable sublimation for purification purposes. So, if you're looking to remove boric acid from your nanoparticles, a washing and decanting method is more practical. If there is a need to ensure the complete removal of boric acid, you may need to conduct multiple wash cycles, each followed by allowing the particles to settle. For very stringent purity requirements, additional steps, such as dialysis or using purified solvents in a controlled environment, may be necessary."},{"prompt":"i'll end up having to get a centrefuge , or make one somehow , maybe an old washing mashing lol .. spin cycle time hahha","completion":"That's quite an innovative idea! While it may seem a bit unconventional, the concept behind using a washing machine's spin cycle as a makeshift centrifuge is to harness the same basic principle: spinning a container to create centrifugal force, which separates substances of different densities. However, there are significant differences between the controlled conditions of a laboratory centrifuge and a household washing machine spin cycle that need to be considered: 1. **Speed and Force Control**: Laboratory centrifuges allow precise control over the rotational speed, which is crucial for the gentle handling of nanoparticles. Washing machines are not designed for such fine control and may exert excessive force, potentially damaging sensitive particles. 2. **Balance and Safety**: Laboratory centrifuges are designed for balanced loading to ensure safe operation. Washing machines are less sensitive to imbalances but may pose a risk if used for small, unbalanced loads like individual sample containers. 3. **Cleanliness and Contamination**: Laboratory centrifuges are designed for cleanroom compatibility and can minimize contamination risks, which is critical when working with nanoparticles for certain applications. In contrast, washing machines are not built to the same cleanliness standards required for most scientific research. 4. **Sample Containment**: A laboratory centrifuge uses sealed rotors or buckets to avoid spillage or aerosolization of samples. In a washing machine, it would be challenging to properly secure and contain nanoparticle samples. 5. **Efficiency**: Washing machines are constructed for bulk water and clothing, and lack the refined efficiency necessary for small-volume and precise nanoparticle sedimentation. While the idea of using a household appliance might provide a temporary solution in a very rudimentary setting, it's generally not advisable or practical for nanoparticle research where precision, sample integrity, and contamination are major concerns. If budget constraints make a new laboratory centrifuge unfeasible, you might consider exploring surplus lab equipment from universities or research institutions, which can sometimes yield cost-effective options. Additionally, there are often smaller, more affordable tabletop centrifuges available that are well-suited for small sample volumes and are designed for laboratory use."},{"prompt":"there are hand crank centrefuges , i thought about that , but maybe it wouldnt work well due to the nature of it ,, who knows , but then there's getting a hand crank one and modifying it with a motor so i can switch it on and come back later","completion":"Hand-crank centrifuges are indeed an option for low-resource settings or applications where electrical power is not readily available. These devices have been used historically in medical fields, especially in remote areas, to centrifuge blood samples and other fluids. Here's a breakdown of their potential application to your situation: **Pros of Hand-Crank Centrifuges**: 1. **Simplicity**: They are simple to operate and maintain. 2. **Portability**: Being manual, they are easily transported and used in areas without access to power. 3. **Affordability**: Typically cheaper than electric centrifuges. **Cons of Hand-Crank Centrifuges**: 1. **Speed Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent speed by hand cranking is challenging, which could affect the reproducibility and efficiency of particle separation. 2. **Labor-Intensive**: Continuous hand cranking can be tiring, and the duration for effective nanoparticle separation might be impractical. 3. **Limited Speed and Capacity**: Hand-crank centrifuges usually can't achieve the high speeds or accommodate the sample volumes that electric centrifuges can. As for your idea of modifying a hand-crank centrifuge with a motor, that introduces another set of considerations: **Pros of Motor Modification**: 1. **Automation**: Attaching a motor allows for consistency in rotation speed and reduces manual labor. 2. **Adjustability**: Depending on the motor and control system, you could potentially control the speed and duration of spins more precisely than with hand cranking. **Cons of Motor Modification**: 1. **Complexity**: Attaching a motor and ensuring it operates safely and effectively would require some engineering knowledge and possibly additional parts and customization. 2. **Safety**: The centrifuge must be adapted to handle the forces exerted by the motor without risk of failure or sample loss. 3. **Balance**: Proper balancing and calibration would be necessary to prevent damage to the centrifuge or accidents during operation. If you possess the necessary technical skills or have access to someone who does, modifying a hand-crank centrifuge could be a viable project. You would need to ensure the motorization does not introduce vibrations or movements that could disrupt the separation process, and the entire system would need to be robust enough to operate safely at the required speeds. However, for nanoparticle work where precision and control are paramount, investing in a purpose-built laboratory centrifuge would typically be the more suitable and reliable choice. If cost is a major concern, consider looking for second-hand laboratory equipment or contacting suppliers for refurbished models, which can be much less expensive than new ones while still providing the necessary functionality for nanoparticle research."},{"prompt":"what rpm is typically needed for a centrefuge for nanoparticles","completion":"The required rotational speed (RPM) for centrifuging nanoparticles can vary widely depending on several factors, including the size and density of the nanoparticles, the density of the solvent or medium they are dispersed in, and the specific separation outcome you're aiming for (e.g., full pellet formation, partial concentration, washing, or purification). For nanoparticles, centrifugal forces need to be high enough to overcome the thermal motion (Brownian motion) that keeps the particles in suspension. Typically, this can mean RPM values ranging from a few thousand up to 15,000 RPM or more for very small nanoparticles (on the order of tens to a few hundred nanometers). Ultracentrifuges, which can reach speeds of 100,000 RPM or more, might even be necessary for nanoparticles that are only a few nanometers in size or for those that have very low density contrasts with their solvent. For example: - **Larger nanoparticles (e.g. > 1 µm)** might only require modest RPM values (e.g. 3,000 - 10,000 RPM). - **Smaller nanoparticles (e.g. 100 - 500 nm)** may require higher RPM values (e.g. 10,000 - 30,000 RPM). - **Very small nanoparticles (e.g. < 100 nm)** may require very high RPM values (e.g. 50,000 - 90,000 RPM or more), typically necessitating an ultracentrifuge. It's important to note that the centrifugal force experienced by particles is not only a function of the RPM but also of the radius of the rotor (the distance from the center of rotation to the sample). The actual force exerted on the particles is described by the relative centrifugal force (RCF), often expressed in units of \\"g\\" (gravitational acceleration). RCF can be calculated from the RPM and rotor radius using the following formula: [ RCF = frac{(r times (RPM)^2) times 1.118 times 10^{-5}}{g} ] Where: - RCF is the relative centrifugal force (in g), - r is the rotor radius (in cm), - RPM is the rotational speed, and - g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 980 cm/s^2). Manufacturers of centrifuges or rotors usually provide nomograms or online calculators to directly convert RPM to RCF if the radius of the rotor is known. Finding the optimal speed for your specific system will likely require experimentation and could involve iteratively adjusting the RPM and checking the separation efficiency until you reach the best conditions for your process. It's also advised to consult the literature for protocols specific to the type of nanoparticles you are working with."},{"prompt":"give me a piece about beautyful city of new orleans","completion":"New Orleans - The Soulful Charm of the Crescent City Nestled along the banks of the mighty Mississippi River, New Orleans stands as a true gem in the American landscape, exuding a vibrant charm that captures the hearts of all who visit.
