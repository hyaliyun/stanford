Parametric representation of the curve C: The given equation is x^2 - y^2 + 2xy = 1. We can rewrite this as (x + y)^2 - 2y^2 = 1. Let x + y = t, then x = t - y. Substituting x in the equation, we get: (t - y)^2 - 2y^2 = 1 t^2 - 2ty + y^2 - 2y^2 = 1 t^2 - 2ty - y^2 = 1 Now, let's solve for y in terms of t: y^2 - 2ty + t^2 = 1 y^2 - 2ty + t^2 - 1 = 0 This is a quadratic equation in y. We can solve for y using the quadratic formula: y = (2t ± √(4t^2 - 4(t^2 - 1))) / 2 y = t ± √(4 - 4t^2 + 4t^2) y = t ± √4 So, y = t + 2 or y = t - 2. We can now find the corresponding x values: x = t - y = t - (t + 2) = -2 (for y = t + 2) x = t - y = t - (t - 2) = 2 (for y = t - 2) Thus, the parametric representation of the curve C is: (x, y) = (2, t - 2) or (x, y) = (-2, t + 2) 2. Tangent lines at points P and Q: Let P = (2, t1 - 2) and Q = (-2, t2 + 2) be two points on C. To find the tangent lines at P and Q, we need to find the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt: dx/dt = 0 (since x is constant for both branches) dy/dt = 1 (for the branch with y = t - 2) dy/dt = 1 (for the branch with y = t + 2) Now, we can find the slope of the tangent lines at P and Q: m_P = dy/dt / dx/dt = (1) / (0) (undefined slope) m_Q = dy/dt / dx/dt = (1) / (0) (undefined slope) Since both tangent lines have undefined slopes, they are vertical lines. The equations of the tangent lines at P and Q are: T_P: x = 2 T_Q: x = -2 3. Intersection point of tangent lines T_P and T_Q: Since T_P and T_Q are vertical lines, they intersect at a point with x-coordinate 2 and -2, respectively. However, these points are already on the curve C, so we need to find another intersection point. To do this, we can consider the intersection of T_P with the other branch of C: T_P: x = 2 C: (x, y) = (-2, t + 2) Since x = 2, we have: 2 = -2 This is a contradiction, so there is no intersection point of T_P with the other branch of C. Similarly, for T_Q: T_Q: x = -2 C: (x, y) = (2, t - 2) Since x = -2, we have: -2 = 2 This is also a contradiction, so there is no intersection point of T_Q with the other branch of C.

To do this, we first homogenize the parametric equations of the curve. Let x = X/Z, y = Y/Z, and t = T/Z. Then, we have the following system of equations: x = frac{t^2 - 1}{1} = frac{T^2 - Z^2}{Z} y = frac{t^3 - t}{1} = frac{T^3 - T Z^2}{Z^2} Now, we can eliminate t by solving the first equation for t and substituting it into the second equation: t = frac{x + 1}{1 - x} = frac{T + Z}{Z - T} Substituting this into the second equation, we get: y = frac{((T + Z)/(Z - T))^3 - (T + Z)/(Z - T)}{1} Now, we need to clear the denominators and simplify the equation to obtain a homogeneous polynomial in X, Y, Z. After simplification, we get: Y(Z - T)^3 = (T^3 - T Z^2)(Z^2 - 2TZ + T^2) Expanding and simplifying, we obtain the homogeneous polynomial: F(X, Y, Z) = X^3 - 3X^2Z + 3XZ^2 - Y^2Z = 0 The degree of this polynomial is 3, so the degree of the curve C is 3. Now, we need to find the genus of the curve. For a non-singular projective curve of degree d in mathbb{P}^2, the genus g is given by the formula: g = frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2} However, our curve is singular since it is a rational curve. In this case, we can use the Plücker formula, which takes into account the singularities of the curve: g = frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2} - sum_{i=1}^n delta_i where delta_i are the delta invariants of the singular points of the curve. Since our curve is a rational curve, it has a unique singular point at infinity, which is a cusp. The delta invariant of a cusp is 1.

A pencil of rational curves on X is a linear system of divisors of the form |D + tE|, where D and E are divisors on X, and t is a parameter. 4. The base locus of a pencil F is the set of points in X where all the divisors in F have a common component. 5. The compactified base locus is the closure of the base locus in the projective space containing X. Now, let's analyze the problem: Given that X is a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus 5, we can compute the degree d of the curve using the formula g = (d-1)(d-2)/2: 5 = (d-1)(d-2)/2 10 = (d-1)(d-2) By solving this quadratic equation, we find that d = 4. Now, let's consider the pencil F of rational curves on X. Since the curves in F are rational, they have genus 0. The intersection of a curve in F with X imposes (d-1) = 3 conditions on the curve. Therefore, the dimension of the space of rational curves meeting X in 3 points is 3. The base locus of F consists of the points where all the divisors in F have a common component. Since the dimension of the space of rational curves meeting X in 3 points is 3, the base locus of F is a 0-dimensional subscheme of X. To compute the number of irreducible components of the compactified base locus of F, we need to find the number of points in this 0-dimensional subscheme. This can be done using the intersection number of X with a general curve in F. Let C be a general curve in F. Since C is rational, it has degree 1. The intersection number of X and C is given by the product of their degrees: I(X, C) = 4 * 1 = 4. Therefore, the compactified base locus of F has 4 irreducible components."},{"prompt":"Let C be an irreducible algebraic curve in the projective plane defined by the equation x^2*y - x*y^2 + x^2*z - y^2*z = 0.

Now we need to determine the type of these singular points (node or cusp) by computing the second-order partial derivatives and evaluating the discriminant Δ: F_xx = ∂²F/∂x² = -6x + 2 F_yy = ∂²F/∂y² = 2 F_xy = ∂²F/∂x∂y = 0 The discriminant Δ is given by Δ = F_xx * F_yy - (F_xy)^2. We evaluate Δ at each candidate singular point: At (0, 0): Δ = (-6(0) + 2)(2) - (0)^2 = 4 > 0, so (0, 0) is a node. At (2/3, 0): Δ = (-6(2/3) + 2)(2) - (0)^2 = (-4)(2) - 0 = -8 < 0, so (2/3, 0) is a cusp. Thus, the curve has a node at (0, 0) and a cusp at (2/3, 0)."},{"prompt":"Consider the algebraic curve given by the equation x^3 + y^3 = 3xyz.

Now, we want to compute N_1, the number of solutions in mathbb{P}^2(mathbb{F}_5). To do this, we can use the fact that N_1 = 5^2 + 1 - alpha - overline{alpha}, where alpha and overline{alpha} are the roots of the polynomial 1 - alpha t.

There are four choices for a, and for each choice of a, there are two choices for b and c. This gives us a total of 4 cdot 2 = 8 solutions. Additionally, we have the point (0:0:1), which is also a solution. Therefore, N_1 = 9. Now, we can solve for alpha and overline{alpha}: 9 = 25 + 1 - alpha - overline{alpha} Rightarrow alpha + overline{alpha} = 17.

Then, 17 = 5^{1/2} e^{itheta} + 5^{1/2} e^{-itheta} = 5^{1/2} (e^{itheta} + e^{-itheta}) = 5^{1/2} (2costheta). Solving for costheta, we get costheta = frac{17}{2cdot 5^{1/2}}.

We want to compute the first cohomology group with coefficients in mathbb{Z} of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on X, which is given by H^{0,1}(X). First, note that the variety X is a smooth complex manifold, since the gradients of f_1 and f_2 are linearly independent at every point of X. Therefore, we can apply the Dolbeault cohomology groups to compute the desired cohomology group. Now, we need to compute the kernel and image of the bar{partial} operator.

The bar{partial} operator acts on alpha as follows: bar{partial}alpha = frac{partial alpha_{bar{1}}}{partial bar{z}_2} dbar{z}_1 wedge dbar{z}_2 + frac{partial alpha_{bar{1}}}{partial bar{z}_3} dbar{z}_1 wedge dbar{z}_3 + frac{partial alpha_{bar{2}}}{partial bar{z}_3} dbar{z}_2 wedge dbar{z}_3. Now, we can compute the kernel and image of the bar{partial} operator. The kernel consists of (0,1)-forms alpha such that bar{partial}alpha = 0. This means that the partial derivatives of the components of alpha must vanish, i.e., frac{partial alpha_{bar{1}}}{partial bar{z}_2} = frac{partial alpha_{bar{1}}}{partial bar{z}_3} = frac{partial alpha_{bar{2}}}{partial bar{z}_3} = 0. The image consists of (0,1)-forms alpha that can be written as bar{partial}f for some smooth function f on X. In other words, alpha_{bar{1}} = frac{partial f}{partial bar{z}_1}, alpha_{bar{2}} = frac{partial f}{partial bar{z}_2}, and alpha_{bar{3}} = frac{partial f}{partial bar{z}_3}.

The Riemann-Roch theorem for projective varieties states that: chi(mathcal{F}(m)) = sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i dim H^i(X, mathcal{F}(m)) To compute the Hilbert polynomial P_{mathcal{F}}(m), we can use the following formula for the intersection numbers on X: P_{mathcal{F}}(m) = int_X mathrm{ch}(mathcal{F}(m)) cdot mathrm{td}(X) where mathrm{ch}(mathcal{F}(m)) is the Chern character of the sheaf mathcal{F}(m) and mathrm{td}(X) is the Todd class of the tangent bundle of X.

First, we need to determine the genus g of the curve X. The given equation Y^2Z - X(X-Z)(X-λZ) = 0 is a smooth projective plane curve of degree 3 (a cubic curve). By the genus-degree formula for plane curves, we have: g = (d - 1)(d - 2) / 2, where d is the degree of the curve. In our case, d = 3, so: g = (3 - 1)(3 - 2) / 2 = 2(1) / 2 = 1. Now, we need to compute the degree of the divisor D associated to O_X(2). Since O_X(2) is the sheaf of sections of the line bundle corresponding to twice the hyperplane section, we have D = 2H, where H is the hyperplane section divisor. The degree of H is equal to the degree of the curve, which is 3. Therefore, deg(D) = 2 * deg(H) = 2 * 3 = 6. Next, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For a smooth plane curve of degree d, the canonical divisor is given by K = (d - 3)H. In our case, K = (3 - 3)H = 0H, which means that K is the zero divisor. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem: l(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g. Since K is the zero divisor, we have K - D = -D, and l(K - D) = l(-D). By the symmetry property of the Riemann-Roch theorem, we have l(-D) = l(D) - deg(D) - 1 + g. Substituting this into the Riemann-Roch equation, we get: l(D) - (l(D) - deg(D) - 1 + g) = deg(D) + 1 - g. Simplifying, we have: deg(D) - g + 1 = deg(D) - 2g, which implies: l(D) = g + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

We will use the Leray spectral sequence for the projection map π: X → Spec(k) and the sheaf L. The Leray spectral sequence is given by: E_2^{p,q} = H^p(Spec(k), R^qπ_*L) ⇒ H^{p+q}(X, L). Since X is a projective variety, the higher direct images R^qπ_*L vanish for q > 0.

These open sets are isomorphic to the affine line A^1(C), and their intersection U_0 ∩ U_1 is isomorphic to (C^*)^1, the nonzero complex numbers. Now, let's compute the cohomology groups: 1.

Since U_0 ∩ U_1 is isomorphic to (C^*)^1, the only holomorphic functions on U_0 ∩ U_1 are constant functions.

Since X is a curve, we have H^0(X, mathcal{O}_X(-P_1-P_2-3)) = 0. Thus, H^2(X, mathcal{O}_X(-Y)) = 0.

Now, let L' be the line bundle L(-p), which is the tensor product of L with the inverse of the line bundle associated to the divisor p. Then, deg(L') = deg(L) - 1.

Therefore, the surface is smooth. Now, we can compute the Hodge numbers using the Hodge diamond for a smooth projective surface. The Hodge diamond is given by: \`\`\` h^0,0 h^1,0 h^0,1 h^1,1 h^2,0 h^2,1 h^2,2 \`\`\` Since the surface is smooth, we have h^{0,0} = h^{2,2} = 1. The surface is also a degree 4 surface in mathbb{P}^2, so its canonical class is given by K = 4L - 6L = -2L, where L is the class of a line. Thus, the surface has a canonical bundle with degree -2, and so h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 0. To compute h^{1,0} and h^{1,1}, we use the fact that the Euler characteristic chi of a smooth projective surface is given by chi = h^{0,0} - h^{1,0} + h^{2,0} = 1 - h^{1,0}. The Euler characteristic of a degree 4 surface in mathbb{P}^2 is given by chi = frac{1}{2}(4-1)(4-2) = 3. Thus, we have h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 1 - 3 = -2. However, Hodge numbers are non-negative, so we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's re-examine the singular points. We set the partial derivatives to zero: 2x(y^2+z^2) = 0 2y(x^2+z^2) = 0 2z(x^2+y^2) = 0 From the first equation, either x=0 or y^2+z^2=0. If x=0, then from the second equation, either y=0 or z^2=0. If y=0, then we have the point [0:0:1], which is a valid point in projective space. If z^2=0, then z=0, and we have the point [0:1:0], which is also a valid point in projective space. Similarly, from the third equation, we have the point [1:0:0]. Thus, we have three singular points: [0:0:1], [0:1:0], and [1:0:0]. Since the surface has singular points, we cannot directly use the Hodge diamond for smooth surfaces. Instead, we can use the fact that the Hodge numbers are birationally invariant. We can resolve the singularities by blowing up the surface at the three singular points. After resolving the singularities, we obtain a smooth surface with the same Hodge numbers as the original surface. Let S be the smooth surface obtained after resolving the singularities. Then, the Euler characteristic of S is given by chi(S) = chi - sum_{i=1}^3 e_i, where e_i are the exceptional divisors introduced by the blow-ups. Since the singular points are ordinary double points, we have e_i = 1 for all i. Thus, chi(S) = 3 - 3 = 0. The canonical class of S is given by K_S = K + sum_{i=1}^3 e_i = -2L + 3 = L. Thus, S has a canonical bundle with degree 1, and so h^{2,0}(S) = h^{0,2}(S) = 0. Now, we have chi(S) = h^{0,0}(S) - h^{1,0}(S) + h^{2,0}(S) = 1 - h^{1,0}(S). Since chi(S) = 0, we have h^{1,0}(S) = h^{0,1}(S) = 1. Finally, the Hodge numbers for the original surface are the same as those for the resolved surface: h^{0,0} = h^{2,2} = 1 h^{1,0} = h^{0,1} = 1 h^{2,0} = h^{0,2} = 0 h^{1,1} = 1 (by the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes) So, the Hodge numbers for the given variety are h^{0,0} = h^{0,1} = h^{1,0} = h^{1,1} = h^{2,2} = 1 and h^{0,2} = h^{2,0} = 0."},{"prompt":"Find the Hodge polynomial of the complex projective variety defined by the equation x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0.","completion":"To find the Hodge polynomial of the complex projective variety defined by the equation x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0, we first need to compute its cohomology groups.

A holomorphic 2-form on T can be represented as a holomorphic 2-form ω on C^2 that is invariant under the action of the lattice L, i.e., ω(z + l) = ω(z) for all z in C^2 and l in L. Holomorphic 2-forms on C^2 are given by expressions of the form ω = f(z1, z2) dz1 ∧ dz2, where f(z1, z2) is a holomorphic function. In order for ω to be invariant under the action of L, we must have f(z1 + l1, z2 + l2) = f(z1, z2) for all (l1, l2) in L.

Since phi_1 and phi_2 are morphisms of degree 4, we have deg D_1 = deg D_2 = 4(2-1) = 4. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we have 2g_X - 2 = 4(2g_C - 2) + deg D_1 = 4(2g_C - 2) + deg D_2. Since g_X = 3 and g_C = 2, we get 4 = 4 + deg D_1 - deg D_2. This implies that deg D_1 = deg D_2, and hence phi_1^* D_1 sim phi_2^* D_1 sim phi_2^* D_2. Now, consider the divisors phi_1^* D_1 - phi_1^* D_2 and phi_2^* D_1 - phi_2^* D_2. Since they are linearly equivalent, there exists a rational function f on X such that mathrm{div}(f) = phi_1^* D_1 - phi_1^* D_2 = phi_2^* D_1 - phi_2^* D_2. This implies that phi_1^* D_1 - phi_1^* D_2 and phi_2^* D_1 - phi_2^* D_2 have the same zeros and poles, counted with multiplicities. Since phi_1 and phi_2 are non-constant morphisms, they are surjective, and hence the zeros and poles of phi_1^* D_1 - phi_1^* D_2 and phi_2^* D_1 - phi_2^* D_2 are the preimages of the zeros and poles of D_1 - D_2 under phi_1 and phi_2, respectively. Since D_1 - D_2 has degree 0, it follows that phi_1^{-1}(D_1 - D_2) = phi_2^{-1}(D_1 - D_2). This implies that phi_1 and phi_2 agree on the zeros and poles of D_1 - D_2. Since a morphism is determined by its values on a dense subset of its domain, we conclude that phi_1 = phi_2. This shows that phi^*: M_C rightarrow M_X is an injection. Now, let's find the induced map of phi^* on the tangent spaces at the corresponding points. Let [C] in M_C and [X] in M_X be the points corresponding to the curves C and X, respectively. Then the tangent space T_{[C]}M_C can be identified with the space of first-order deformations of C, and the tangent space T_{[X]}M_X can be identified with the space of first-order deformations of X. Given a first-order deformation xi_C of C, we can pull it back via phi to obtain a first-order deformation xi_X = phi^* xi_C of X. This defines a linear map phi^*: T_{[C]}M_C rightarrow T_{[X]}M_X. To see that this map is injective, suppose that phi^* xi_C = 0 for some xi_C in T_{[C]}M_C. This means that the pullback of the deformation xi_C of C via phi is trivial. But this implies that the deformation xi_C itself must be trivial, since otherwise, we would obtain a nontrivial deformation of X by pulling back a nontrivial deformation of C. Therefore, xi_C = 0, and hence phi^* is injective on the tangent spaces."},{"prompt":"What is the degree of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 2?

Let u = x^2, then the equation becomes: -5u^2 - 9u - 4 = 0 Using the quadratic formula, we get: u = frac{-(-9) pm sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4(-5)(-4)}}{2(-5)} u = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 - 80}}{-10} u = frac{9 pm 1}{-10} So we have two possible values for u: u_1 = frac{9 + 1}{-10} = -1 u_2 = frac{9 - 1}{-10} = -frac{4}{5} Since u = x^2, we have: x^2 = -1 has no real solutions. x^2 = -frac{4}{5} has no real solutions. Thus, there are no singular points on the curve with real coordinates."},{"prompt":"Suppose we have a moduli space of algebraic curves that consist of all smooth plane quartic curves.

The moduli space of smooth plane quartic curves has dimension 3(4+1)-10 = 5, where 3 is the number of coefficients in a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4, 4+1 is the number of monomials in a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4, and 10 is the dimension of the projective linear group PGL(3) acting on the space of quartic curves. Now, let's consider the space of singular quartic curves with nodes. A nodal curve is a curve with a single ordinary double point (a node). The condition for a quartic curve to have a node is that its partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z vanish simultaneously at some point. This gives us three equations in the coefficients of the quartic curve, so the space of nodal quartic curves has dimension 3(4+1)-10-3 = 2. When we add one singular quartic curve to the moduli space of smooth plane quartic curves, we are adding a 2-dimensional space to a 5-dimensional space. To keep the moduli space smooth, we need to add enough nodal curves to fill the 2-dimensional space of singular quartic curves with nodes.

In particular, two elliptic curves are isomorphic over a field if and only if they have the same j-invariant. The j-invariant of an elliptic curve E given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B is defined as: j(E) = 1728 * (4A^3) / (4A^3 + 27B^2) We are given that j(E) = 1728, so we have: 1728 = 1728 * (4A^3) / (4A^3 + 27B^2) This simplifies to: 1 = (4A^3) / (4A^3 + 27B^2) Rearranging the equation, we get: 27B^2 = 4A^3 - 4A^3 This implies that 4A^3 = 27B^2, which means that A^3 = 27/4 * B^2. Since A and B are rational numbers, we can write A = a/b and B = c/d, where a, b, c, and d are integers. Then, we have: (a/b)^3 = 27/4 * (c/d)^2 Clearing the denominators, we get: a^3 * d^2 = 27 * b^3 * c^2 / 4 Since the left side is an integer, the right side must also be an integer. This means that b^3 must be divisible by 4, so b must be even. Let b = 2k for some integer k. Then, we have: a^3 * d^2 = 27 * (2k)^3 * c^2 / 4 Simplifying, we get: a^3 * d^2 = 27 * 8 * k^3 * c^2 a^3 * d^2 = 216 * k^3 * c^2 Now, we can see that a^3 must be divisible by 216. Since 216 = 2^3 * 3^3, a must be divisible by 2 and 3. Let a = 6m for some integer m. Then, we have: (6m)^3 * d^2 = 216 * k^3 * c^2 Simplifying, we get: 216 * m^3 * d^2 = 216 * k^3 * c^2 Cancelling the common factor of 216, we obtain: m^3 * d^2 = k^3 * c^2 This equation shows that m^3 is divisible by k^3, so m is divisible by k. Similarly, d^2 is divisible by c^2, so d is divisible by c. Therefore, the elliptic curve E can be written in the form: y^2 = x^3 + (6m)^2 * x + (6m)^3 Since the coefficients of the curve are determined by m, each value of m corresponds to a distinct elliptic curve with j-invariant equal to 1728. However, we are interested in the number of distinct elliptic curves up to isomorphism over the field of rational numbers. It turns out that there is only one such curve, which is the curve with m = 1. This is because any other curve with a different value of m can be transformed into the curve with m = 1 by an appropriate change of variables. Specifically, if we have a curve with m = n, we can make the substitution x = nx' and y = n^2 * y' to obtain the curve with m = 1: y'^2 = x'^3 + 36x' + 216 Thus, there is only one distinct elliptic curve over the field of rational numbers with j-invariant equal to 1728 up to isomorphism."},{"prompt":"Consider the moduli space \`\`\`M_{2,1}\`\`\` of algebraic curves of genus 2 with one marked point.

First, let's compute the dimension of the space of infinitesimal deformations. The tangent space to the moduli space of smooth projective curves of genus g=3 at the point corresponding to the curve C is given by the space of first-order deformations of C, which is isomorphic to the space of global sections of the dualizing sheaf ω_C.

The tangent space to the moduli space of pairs (P, l) at the point corresponding to the pair (P, l) is given by the space of first-order deformations of the pair (P, l), which is isomorphic to the space of global sections of the sheaf Hom(T_C, O_C(P)).

An irreducible double cover of C_B is a curve C that is a 2-to-1 map onto C_B, with ramification points being the preimages of the branch points of the cover. Since C_B has genus 0, by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, the genus of C is given by: g(C) = 1 - n + (n - 1)/2 = 2, where n is the number of branch points of the cover. Solving for n, we get n = 6. Now, we want to find the number of double covers of C_B that have a ramification point over the point of C_A. Since C_A and C_B are distinct points in the moduli space, there is no natural identification of their points. However, we can consider the universal curve over the moduli space and look at the fiber product of the two curves. This will give us a curve C_AB that is a double cover of C_B and has a ramification point over the point corresponding to A. Since there are 6 branch points in the double cover, there are 2^6 = 64 possible choices for the ramification points. However, we need to account for the automorphisms of C_B (i.e., the projective transformations of the projective line), which act on the set of branch points. The group of automorphisms of C_B is PGL(2), which has order 6. Therefore, we need to divide by the size of the automorphism group to get the number of distinct double covers: 64 / 6 = 10.67. However, this number is not an integer, which means that some of the double covers are counted with multiplicity. To resolve this issue, we can use the Hurwitz formula for the number of covers: |Aut(C_AB)| = |Aut(C_B)| * |Aut(C_A)| / |Aut(C)|, where Aut(C) denotes the automorphism group of a curve C. Since C_A has genus 2, its automorphism group has order at most 6, and since C_B has genus 0, its automorphism group has order 6.

From F_z = 0, we have two cases: 1) y = 0 and z neq 0: In this case, F_x = 3x^2 and F_y = x^2. Since F_x = F_y = 0, we have x = 0.

This is a plane curve, and we can compute its genus using the formula for the arithmetic genus of a plane curve: g_a = frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}, where d is the degree of the curve. In our case, the degree of the curve is the highest total degree of any monomial in the equation, which is 5 (from the term x^5).

Thus, the curve has a unique singularity at the point (0, -frac{1}{2}). Now, we can compute the geometric genus using the formula: g = g_a - delta, where delta is the total delta invariant of the singularities. Since we have only one singularity, we need to compute the delta invariant for this singularity. For a plane curve singularity, the delta invariant is given by: delta = frac{(m-1)(n-1)}{2}, where m and n are the multiplicities of the branches of the curve passing through the singularity.

The moduli space M_{1,1} parametrizes isomorphism classes of elliptic curves with a marked point.

Now, let mathcal{L} be a line bundle of degree d on M_{1,1}. The dimension of the space of sections of mathcal{L}, denoted by H^0(M_{1,1},mathcal{L}), is given by the Riemann-Roch theorem. For a line bundle mathcal{L} on a compact Riemann surface X of genus g, the Riemann-Roch theorem states that dim H^0(X,mathcal{L}) - dim H^0(X,mathcal{K}_Xotimesmathcal{L}^{-1}) = deg(mathcal{L}) + 1 - g, where mathcal{K}_X is the canonical bundle on X. In our case, X = M_{1,1}, which has genus g = 0. Therefore, the Riemann-Roch theorem simplifies to dim H^0(M_{1,1},mathcal{L}) = deg(mathcal{L}) + 1.

A point in this moduli space corresponds to a genus 2 smooth projective curve. Find the dimension of this moduli space.","completion":"To find the dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus 2, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem and the concept of deformation theory. The dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g can be computed as the dimension of the space of first-order deformations of the curve minus the dimension of the space of first-order automorphisms of the curve. This is given by the formula: dim(M_g) = dim(H^1(C, T_C)) - dim(H^0(C, T_C)) where M_g is the moduli space of genus g curves, C is a smooth projective curve of genus g, T_C is the tangent bundle of C, and H^i(C, T_C) are the cohomology groups of the tangent bundle. For genus 2, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a curve C of genus g: chi(L) = deg(L) + 1 - g where chi(L) is the Euler characteristic of L, and deg(L) is the degree of L. For the tangent bundle T_C, we have: deg(T_C) = 2g - 2 So for genus 2, we have deg(T_C) = 2. Using the Riemann-Roch theorem, we get: chi(T_C) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1 Since H^0(C, T_C) is the space of global sections of T_C, we have: dim(H^0(C, T_C)) = chi(T_C) = 1 Now, we need to compute the dimension of H^1(C, T_C). We can use Serre duality, which states that: H^1(C, T_C) ≅ H^0(C, K_C ⊗ T_C^*) where K_C is the canonical bundle of C, and T_C^* is the dual bundle of T_C. For a curve of genus g, the canonical bundle has degree 2g - 2, so for genus 2, we have deg(K_C) = 2. Since T_C has degree 2, the dual bundle T_C^* has degree -2, and the tensor product K_C ⊗ T_C^* has degree 0. Applying the Riemann-Roch theorem again, we get: chi(K_C ⊗ T_C^*) = 0 + 1 - 2 = -1 Since chi(K_C ⊗ T_C^*) = dim(H^0(C, K_C ⊗ T_C^*)) - dim(H^1(C, T_C)), we have: dim(H^1(C, T_C)) = dim(H^0(C, K_C ⊗ T_C^*)) - (-1) = 1 Finally, we can compute the dimension of the moduli space of genus 2 curves: dim(M_2) = dim(H^1(C, T_C)) - dim(H^0(C, T_C)) = 1 - 1 = 0 However, this result is not correct, as the moduli space of genus 2 curves is known to be 1-dimensional.

The genus of X can be computed using the Hurwitz formula: 2g(C) - 2 = |G|(2g(X) - 2) + ∑(r_i - 1), where g(C) is the genus of C, g(X) is the genus of X, and r_i are the ramification indices of the quotient map.

Torsion Points: We will use Nagell-Lutz theorem to find the torsion points. According to the theorem, if (x, y) is a torsion point with integer coordinates, then either y = 0 or y^2 divides the discriminant of the curve. The discriminant of the given curve, Delta = -16(4(-2)^3 - 27(2)^2) = -16(32 - 108) = 1216. The divisors of Delta are pm 1, pm 2, pm 4, pm 8, pm 19, pm 38, pm 76, pm 152, pm 304, pm 608, pm 1216. Now, we will check for each divisor d of Delta if there exists an integer x such that y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2 has an integer solution. - For d = pm 1, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 2, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 4, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 8, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 19, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 38, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 76, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 152, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 304, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 608, there is no integer solution for x. - For d = pm 1216, there is no integer solution for x. Thus, there are no torsion points with integer coordinates. However, we need to consider torsion points with complex coordinates as well. Since the curve is defined over the field of complex numbers, we can use the fact that the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over mathbb{C} is isomorphic to either mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} or mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} times mathbb{Z}/mmathbb{Z}, where n and m are coprime integers. In this case, since we have no torsion points with integer coordinates, the torsion subgroup is trivial, i.e., isomorphic to mathbb{Z}/1mathbb{Z}, which means it contains only the point at infinity, denoted as O. 2. Free Part: The free part of the group E(mathbb{C}) is isomorphic to mathbb{Z}^r, where r is the rank of the curve. The rank of an elliptic curve over mathbb{C} is not easy to compute in general. However, for this specific curve, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. Since we have no torsion points, the rank must be at least 1. Thus, the structure of the group E(mathbb{C}) is mathbb{Z}/1mathbb{Z} times mathbb{Z}^r, where r geq 1. To find the actual rank and generators of the free part, one would need to use more advanced techniques like the method of elliptic logarithms or the method of descent."},{"prompt":"Let A be an Abelian variety over a field k of characteristic 0.

Since L is ample, there exists a positive integer n such that L^n is very ample. This means that there exists an embedding φ: A → P^N given by the complete linear system |L^n| for some N. Now, consider the image of A(k) under this embedding, which is a set of points in P^N(k). Since A is an Abelian variety, it is a projective variety, and its image under φ is a closed subvariety of P^N. Moreover, the degree of a point x in A(k) is equal to the degree of the point φ(x) in P^N(k) with respect to the hyperplane divisor class. Let H be a hyperplane in P^N. Then the intersection of A with H is a divisor D on A, and we have: degree(x) = degree([x]) = degree(D) Now, we have the following relation between the degrees of divisors on A and their intersection with the polarization L: degree(D) = D · L^{dim(A) - 1} Since L is a polarization of degree d, we have: degree(x) = D · L^{dim(A) - 1} = d · (D · L^{dim(A) - 2}) Now, consider the function f(x) = degree(x) - d.

This line intersects the curve at a third point, which we will call R.

We want to show that there are at most finitely many non-trivial torsion points on E.

Since φ is periodic with periods 1 and τ, this implies that nz is also a point in the complex torus C/Z + Zτ. Thus, nz = m + m'τ for some integers m and m'. Dividing by n, we get z = (m/n) + (m'/n)τ. Since z is in C/Z + Zτ, the real and imaginary parts of z must be in the interval [0, 1). Therefore, there are only finitely many possibilities for the fractions m/n and m'/n, as they must be rational numbers with denominator at most n.

The torsion points on an elliptic curve form a subgroup of the group of points on the curve. 2. The number of torsion points of order n is at most n^2. Now, we are given that |E[5]| = 8. Since the torsion points form a subgroup, this implies that the 5-torsion subgroup has order 8. The only possible structures for this subgroup are either Z_8 or Z_2 x Z_4. Let's consider the Weil pairing, which is a bilinear map e_n: E[n] x E[n] -> μ_n, where μ_n is the group of nth roots of unity. The Weil pairing is alternating, which means that e_n(P, P) = 1 for all P in E[n]. Now, let's analyze the two possible structures for the 5-torsion subgroup: 1. If the 5-torsion subgroup is Z_8, then there exists a point Q of order 8 in E[5]. However, this would mean that e_5(2Q, 2Q) = e_8(Q, Q) = 1, which contradicts the fact that the Weil pairing is alternating. Therefore, the 5-torsion subgroup cannot be Z_8. 2. If the 5-torsion subgroup is Z_2 x Z_4, then there exist points P1 and P2 in E[5] such that P1 has order 2 and P2 has order 4. In this case, we have e_5(P1, P2) = e_4(2P1, P2) = e_4(O, P2) = 1, where O is the identity element. This is consistent with the properties of the Weil pairing. Thus, the 5-torsion subgroup must be Z_2 x Z_4. This means that there is a point of order 2 and a point of order 4 in E[5]. A point of order 2 on the elliptic curve has the form (x, 0), which means that x^3 + ax + b = 0. Let x_2 be the x-coordinate of this point. Then, x_2^3 + ax_2 + b ≡ 0 (mod 5). A point of order 4 on the elliptic curve satisfies 2P = (x_4, 0), where P is the point of order 4. Let x_4 be the x-coordinate of this point. Then, (2x_4)^3 + a(2x_4) + b ≡ 0 (mod 5).

We can use the addition formula for points on an elliptic curve: If P = (x_1, y_1) and Q = (x_2, y_2), then the sum P + Q = (x_3, y_3), where: x_3 = lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 y_3 = lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 and lambda = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} if P neq Q lambda = frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} if P = Q In our case, P = (1,1) and Q = (0, sqrt{2}), so P neq Q.

The inverse of a point (x, y) on an elliptic curve is given by (x, -y). So, we have: 1. Inverse of (frac{1}{2}, -frac{3}{4}) is (frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{4}). Since (frac{1}{2}, -frac{3}{4}) + (frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{4}) = mathcal{O}, the inverse is in G. 2. Inverse of (frac{23}{16}, -frac{313}{64}) is (frac{23}{16}, frac{313}{64}). Since (frac{23}{16}, -frac{313}{64}) + (frac{23}{16}, frac{313}{64}) = mathcal{O}, the inverse is in G. 3. Inverse of (-frac{5}{2}, -frac{11}{4}) is (-frac{5}{2}, frac{11}{4}).

First, we observe that operatorname{lcm}(m,n)=operatorname{lcm}(m+n,operatorname{char}(k)) implies that m+n is divisible by operatorname{char}(k).

Now, let's consider the group scheme of finite flat group homomorphisms from A to itself, which are fixed by φ. Denote this group scheme by G. Since φ has degree 3, it follows that the order of G divides 3^2 = 9. Moreover, the order of G must also divide the order of the group of automorphisms of A, which is a finite group. Recall that an Abelian variety is a projective algebraic group, so the automorphism group of A is a linear algebraic group. In particular, it is an algebraic subgroup of the general linear group GL(2, C). Since the order of G divides 9, it follows that G is either a cyclic group of order 3, a cyclic group of order 9, or a product of two cyclic groups of order 3. Now, let's analyze the action of φ on G. Since φ is an endomorphism of A, it induces an action on the group of automorphisms of A, and hence on G. The fixed points of this action are precisely the connected components of G that we want to count. Suppose that G is a cyclic group of order 3. Then, φ acts on G by multiplication by a 3rd root of unity. In this case, there is exactly one connected component of G fixed by φ, namely the identity element. Suppose that G is a cyclic group of order 9. Then, φ acts on G by multiplication by a 9th root of unity. In this case, there are three connected components of G fixed by φ: the identity element and the two elements of order 3. Finally, suppose that G is a product of two cyclic groups of order 3. Then, φ acts on G by multiplication by a pair of 3rd roots of unity. In this case, there are four connected components of G fixed by φ: the identity element and the three non-identity elements of the form (a, b), where a and b are 3rd roots of unity. In conclusion, the number of connected components of the group scheme of finite flat group homomorphisms from A to itself, which are fixed by φ, is either 1, 3, or 4, depending on the structure of the group scheme G."},{"prompt":"One possible numerical problem related to Abelian varieties is: \\"Suppose you have an Abelian variety A defined over the field of rational numbers Q, such that its dimension as a complex manifold is 2. Let P be a rational point on A, and let n be a positive integer. Compute the cardinality of the group of rational points on the subgroup nP of A generated by n copies of P.","completion":"Let A be an Abelian variety defined over the field of rational numbers Q with dimension 2. Let P be a rational point on A, and let n be a positive integer. We want to compute the cardinality of the group of rational points on the subgroup nP of A generated by n copies of P. First, let's recall some basic facts about Abelian varieties. An Abelian variety is a projective algebraic group, which means it is both a projective algebraic variety and a group. In particular, it has a group law that is defined by rational functions. The dimension of an Abelian variety is the dimension of the underlying algebraic variety. Since A is defined over Q, its group of rational points, denoted A(Q), is a finitely generated abelian group. By the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, we can write A(Q) as the direct sum of a free part and a torsion part: A(Q) ≅ Z^r ⊕ T, where r is the rank of A(Q) and T is the torsion subgroup of A(Q). Now, let's consider the subgroup nP of A generated by n copies of P. This subgroup is also a finitely generated abelian group, and we can write it as a direct sum of a free part and a torsion part: nP ≅ Z^s ⊕ U, where s is the rank of nP and U is the torsion subgroup of nP. Since nP is a subgroup of A(Q), we have s ≤ r. Moreover, every element of nP is of the form nQ for some Q in A(Q). Therefore, the group of rational points on nP is given by the set of points Q in A(Q) such that nQ is in nP. In other words, we want to compute the cardinality of the set {Q ∈ A(Q) : nQ ∈ nP}. To do this, we can use the fact that the multiplication-by-n map, [n]: A(Q) → A(Q), given by [n](Q) = nQ, is a group homomorphism. The kernel of this homomorphism is precisely the set of points Q in A(Q) such that nQ = 0. This kernel is a subgroup of the torsion subgroup T, and its cardinality is equal to the number of n-torsion points in A(Q), which we denote by |A[n](Q)|. By the first isomorphism theorem for groups, we have A(Q) / ker([n]) ≅ Im([n]), where Im([n]) is the image of the multiplication-by-n map. Since ker([n]) is a subgroup of T, the quotient A(Q) / ker([n]) is isomorphic to a subgroup of A(Q) / T ≅ Z^r. Therefore, the cardinality of Im([n]) is a divisor of the cardinality of A(Q) / T, which is equal to 2^r. Now, we can compute the cardinality of the group of rational points on nP as follows: |{Q ∈ A(Q) : nQ ∈ nP}| = |A(Q) / ker([n])| = |Im([n])|. Since |Im([n])| is a divisor of 2^r, the cardinality of the group of rational points on nP is a power of 2. To determine the exact power of 2, we would need more information about the specific Abelian variety A and the point P."},{"prompt":"Find the number of ways of embedding the elliptic curve E: y^2=x^3+x in mathbb{P}^2, i.e., the number of non-isomorphic projective algebraic curves that contain E as a closed subscheme.","completion":"To find the number of ways of embedding the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + x in mathbb{P}^2, we first homogenize the equation to obtain a projective curve in mathbb{P}^2. We introduce a new variable z and multiply each term by the appropriate power of z to make all terms homogeneous of the same degree. In this case, the degree is 3. So, we get the equation: Y^2Z = X^3 + XZ^2. Now, we want to find the number of non-isomorphic projective algebraic curves that contain E as a closed subscheme. In other words, we want to find the number of distinct curves in mathbb{P}^2 that have E as a subset. Since E is an elliptic curve, it is a smooth curve of genus 1. In mathbb{P}^2, a smooth curve of genus 1 is unique up to projective equivalence. This means that any other curve in mathbb{P}^2 containing E as a closed subscheme must be a singular curve that contains E. Let's consider the possible singular curves in mathbb{P}^2 that can contain E. The singular curves can be obtained by adding a multiple of a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 to the equation of E. Let F(X, Y, Z) = Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2, and let G(X, Y, Z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3. Then, the singular curves containing E are given by the equation: F(X, Y, Z) + lambda G(X, Y, Z) = 0, where lambda is a scalar. However, since E is a smooth curve, the only way for a singular curve to contain E is if the singular curve is a double cover of E. This means that the singular curve must be of the form: F(X, Y, Z) + lambda G(X, Y, Z) = (Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2)^2. Now, we need to count the number of distinct curves of this form. Since the equation is homogeneous, we can consider the projective space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 6 in the variables X, Y, and Z. This projective space has dimension 9 (corresponding to the 9 coefficients of a general homogeneous polynomial of degree 6). The space of curves of the form (Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2)^2 is a linear subspace of this projective space, and it has dimension 1 (corresponding to the scalar lambda). Therefore, the number of non-isomorphic projective algebraic curves that contain E as a closed subscheme is the number of points in the projective space of dimension 9 minus the dimension of the linear subspace of curves of the form (Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2)^2, which is: 9 - 1 = 8.

Now, consider any element Q in G. Since Q in G_1 and Q in G_2, there exist integers a and b such that Q = aP_1 and Q = bP_2. Then, we have aP_1 = bP_2. Multiplying both sides by mn, we get (amn)P_1 = (bmn)P_2. Since mP_1 = 0 and nP_2 = 0, we can rewrite this as (adn)P_1 = (bdm)P_2. Now, note that d divides both adn and bdm. Thus, we can write adn = dk_1 and bdm = dk_2 for some integers k_1 and k_2. Then, we have (dk_1)P_1 = (dk_2)P_2. Dividing both sides by d, we get (k_1)P_1 = (k_2)P_2. Since P_1 and P_2 have orders m and n, respectively, it follows that k_1 is a multiple of m and k_2 is a multiple of n.

Find the rank and torsion subgroup of A.","completion":"To find the rank and torsion subgroup of the Abelian variety A = E times E, we first need to analyze the elliptic curve E given by the equation y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 6. First, we find the discriminant of the curve to ensure it is non-singular. The discriminant of an elliptic curve given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B is Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2). In our case, A = -7 and B = 6, so the discriminant is: Delta = -16(4(-7)^3 + 27(6)^2) = -16(-1372) = 21952 Since Delta neq 0, the curve is non-singular. Next, we find the torsion points on the curve. Torsion points are the points on the elliptic curve that have finite order. We can use Nagell-Lutz theorem to find the torsion points. According to the Nagell-Lutz theorem, if (x, y) is a torsion point with integer coordinates, then either y = 0 or y^2 divides the discriminant Delta. 1. If y = 0, we have x^3 - 7x + 6 = 0. Factoring, we get (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 6) = 0. The integer solutions are x = 1 and x = -2. Thus, we have two torsion points: (1, 0) and (-2, 0). 2. If y^2 divides Delta, we have y^2 | 21952. The divisors of 21952 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 1373, 2746, 5492, 10984, 21952. We can check each divisor to see if it corresponds to a valid point on the curve.

Now, we need to find the rank of E(mathbb{Q}). We can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that E(mathbb{Q}) cong mathbb{Z}^r oplus T, where r is the rank and T is the torsion subgroup. To find the rank, we can use the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which relates the rank to the order of vanishing of the L-function associated with the elliptic curve at s = 1. However, this conjecture is not proven in general, and computing the L-function is not trivial. Alternatively, we can use SageMath, an open-source mathematics software, to compute the rank of the elliptic curve.

Let's use the following formulas for point addition on elliptic curves: If P = (x1, y1) and Q = (x2, y2), then the sum R = P + Q = (x3, y3) is given by: x3 = (λ^2 - x1 - x2) mod 7 y3 = (λ(x1 - x3) - y1) mod 7 where λ = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod 7. We can now check each point to see if it has order 3: - (0,0) is the point at infinity, so it has order 1. - (1,0) and (6,0) are points of order 2 since adding them to themselves results in the point at infinity. - (2,1) + (2,1) = (5,6) and (2,1) + (5,6) = (2,6), so (2,1) has order 3.

Given the elliptic curve E: y^2 = x^3 + 10x + 6 over the finite field mathbb{F}_{17}, we want to compute the number of points on the curve E(mathbb{F}_{17}). Step 1: Compute the possible values of the trace of Frobenius.

If the curve has a point of order 3, then the number of points on the curve is divisible by 3. 1.

Check for a point of order 3: A point of order 3 satisfies the equation [3]P = mathcal{O}, where P is a point on the curve and mathcal{O} is the point at infinity. We can check all possible points on the curve and find that there is no point of order 3.

We can use the quadratic formula: x = (13 ± √(13² - 4 * 61)) / 2 x = (13 ± √(169 - 244)) / 2 x = (13 ± √(-75)) / 2 Since we are working over a field with characteristic different from 2 and 3, the square root of -75 exists in the field.

Since we are working over the complex numbers, we have an infinite field, and the order of J(C) is infinite. Next, let's find the number of connected components of J(C) over the complex numbers. The Jacobian J(C) of an algebraic curve C of genus g is an abelian variety of dimension g. For an elliptic curve, the Jacobian is isomorphic to the curve itself, and since the curve is connected, its Jacobian has only one connected component. In summary, the order of J(C) is infinite, and the number of connected components of J(C) over the complex numbers is 1."},{"prompt":"Find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation: y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 at the point (2, 3).","completion":"To find the Jacobian of the algebraic curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y.

Determine the genus of C in terms of q.","completion":"Let E_1 and E_2 be the two elliptic curves such that the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to E_1 x E_2. Since the Jacobian of a curve is an abelian variety, the dimension of J is equal to the genus g of C. In this case, the dimension of J is the sum of the dimensions of E_1 and E_2, which are both 1 (as they are elliptic curves). Therefore, g = 1 + 1 = 2. Now, we will use the Hasse-Weil bound to relate the number of points on C to its genus. The Hasse-Weil bound states that for a smooth projective algebraic curve C defined over a finite field with q elements, q + 1 - 2g√q ≤ #C(𝔽_q) ≤ q + 1 + 2g√q, where #C(𝔽_q) denotes the number of 𝔽_q-rational points on C. Since the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to E_1 x E_2, we have #J(𝔽_q) = #E_1(𝔽_q) × #E_2(𝔽_q). By the Hasse-Weil bound for elliptic curves, we have (q + 1 - 2√q)² ≤ #J(𝔽_q) ≤ (q + 1 + 2√q)². Now, by the Lefschetz fixed-point formula, we know that #C(𝔽_q) = q + 1 - (number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on C). Since the Jacobian J of C is isomorphic to E_1 x E_2, the number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on C is equal to the number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on J, which is equal to the product of the number of non-trivial geometric Frobenius fixed points on E_1 and E_2.

What is the order of J(C)?","completion":"To find the order of the Jacobian J(C) of the given smooth cubic curve C, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve (like our cubic curve) is finitely generated. First, we need to find the rank of the curve. The rank is the number of independent points that generate the group of rational points. For our curve C: y^2 = x^3 - x, we can use the Lutz-Nagell theorem, which states that if a point (x, y) on the curve has integer coordinates and x divides the discriminant of the curve, then x must be a square. The discriminant of our curve is Delta = -16(4 - 27) = 368. The only divisors of 368 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 23, 46, 92, and 184. Checking these values, we find that none of them are squares, so the Lutz-Nagell theorem implies that the rank of our curve is 0. Now we need to find the torsion subgroup of J(C). The torsion subgroup consists of points of finite order, i.e., points that, when added to themselves a certain number of times, give the identity element (the point at infinity). For elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers, the possible torsion subgroups are either cyclic of order n (denoted by Z/nZ) or a product of two cyclic groups of coprime orders m and n (denoted by Z/mZ × Z/nZ). For our curve, we can find the torsion subgroup by looking for rational points on the curve. We can easily find four rational points: (0, 0), (1, 0), (-1, 0), and the point at infinity. Since the rank is 0, these points generate the entire group of rational points on the curve. The points (0, 0) and (1, 0) have order 2, and the point (-1, 0) has order 3. Therefore, the torsion subgroup is isomorphic to Z/2Z × Z/3Z. Finally, we can find the order of the Jacobian J(C) by multiplying the orders of the torsion subgroup and the free part (which is trivial in this case, since the rank is 0). The order of the torsion subgroup is 2 × 3 = 6, so the order of J(C) is 6."},{"prompt":"Consider the elliptic curve with equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1 over the field mathbb{F}_7.

For x = 2: y^2 = 2^3 + 2*2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 3 There is no y in F such that y^2 = 3. For x = 4: y^2 = 4^3 + 2*4 + 1 = 64 + 8 + 1 = 73 ≡ 3 (mod 10) There is no y in F such that y^2 = 3. For x = 6: y^2 = 6^3 + 2*6 + 1 = 216 + 12 + 1 = 229 ≡ 9 (mod 10) y = 6 and y = 4 satisfy this equation since 6^2 = 36 ≡ 9 (mod 10) and 4^2 = 16 ≡ 9 (mod 10). For x = 8: y^2 = 8^3 + 2*8 + 1 = 512 + 16 + 1 = 529 ≡ 9 (mod 10) y = 6 and y = 4 satisfy this equation since 6^2 = 36 ≡ 9 (mod 10) and 4^2 = 16 ≡ 9 (mod 10). So, the points on the curve C over F are (6, 4), (6, 6), (8, 4), and (8, 6). Now, we need to find the number of points on the Jacobian J(F). The Jacobian of an algebraic curve is an abelian group, and its elements are equivalence classes of divisors on the curve. In this case, the Jacobian J(F) is isomorphic to the group of divisors of degree 0 on the curve C modulo linear equivalence. Since there are 4 points on the curve C, there are 2^4 = 16 possible divisors of degree 0. However, we need to account for linear equivalence, which identifies divisors that differ by a constant multiple. In this case, the Jacobian J(F) is isomorphic to the group of divisors of degree 0 on the curve C modulo linear equivalence. Since there are 4 points on the curve C, there are 2^4 = 16 possible divisors of degree 0. However, we need to account for linear equivalence, which identifies divisors that differ by a constant multiple. The number of linearly equivalent divisors is equal to the number of points on the curve plus one (for the divisor of degree 0). So, there are 4 + 1 = 5 linearly equivalent divisors. Therefore, the number of points on J(F) is the number of divisors of degree 0 modulo linear equivalence, which is 16 / 5 = 3.2. Since the number of points must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, giving us 4 points on J(F)."},{"prompt":"Let C be the curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1.

In this case, the elliptic curve is given by the equation y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 1. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture states that: text{rank}(E(mathbb{Q})) = text{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s) Where text{rank}(E(mathbb{Q})) is the rank of the elliptic curve over the rational numbers, and L(E,s) is the L-function associated with the elliptic curve. The value of varthetaleft(frac{1}{4}right)^4 is related to the central value of the L-function, which is L(E,1). Since we have calculated varthetaleft(frac{1}{4}right)^4 = 16pi^4, this suggests that the L-function has a zero of order 4 at s=1. Therefore, the rank of the elliptic curve is 4. The number of rational points on the curve is infinite since the rank is greater than 0.

Let's first find the invariants g_2 and g_3 of the curve. We can rewrite the given equation as y^2 = 4x^3 - 12x - 16, which is in the Weierstrass normal form y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2x - g_3. Comparing the coefficients, we have g_2 = 12 and g_3 = 16. Now, we can use the Weierstrass wp-function to find the half-periods. The wp-function satisfies the differential equation left(frac{dwp}{dz}right)^2 = 4wp^3 - g_2wp - g_3. The half-periods omega_1 and omega_2 are the solutions to the equation wp(omega_i) = 0. To find the half-periods, we need to compute the integrals of the form int_{infty}^x frac{dx}{y}, where x is a point on the curve. These integrals can be computed numerically, but they are generally difficult to compute analytically. For the purpose of this problem, we will denote the half-periods by omega_1 and omega_2 without computing them explicitly.

Note that the expression is still in terms of the half-periods omega_1 and omega_2, which we did not compute explicitly.

The curve is a plane curve of degree 3, so by the genus-degree formula, we have: g = frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1 Now, let's compute the canonical divisor K. Since the curve is given by the equation F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2 = 0, we have: frac{partial F}{partial x} = -3x^2 - 2x frac{partial F}{partial y} = 2y The canonical divisor K is given by the zeros of the differential form omega = frac{dx}{frac{partial F}{partial y}} = frac{dx}{2y}, which are the points where y = 0. In this case, we have: x^3 + x^2 = 0 Rightarrow x^2(x+1) = 0 So the canonical divisor is K = 2(0,0) + 2(-1,0) = 2Q + 2P. Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for any divisor D on a curve of genus g: l(D) - l(K - D) = deg(D) + 1 - g In our case, D = 3P - 2Q, so K - D = (2Q + 2P) - (3P - 2Q) = 4Q - P. We have: l(3P - 2Q) - l(4Q - P) = deg(3P - 2Q) + 1 - 1 Since deg(3P - 2Q) = 3 - 2 = 1, we get: l(3P - 2Q) - l(4Q - P) = 1 Now we need to find the dimensions of the spaces L(3P - 2Q) and L(4Q - P). For L(3P - 2Q), we are looking for functions f(x, y) such that (operatorname{div}(f) + 3P - 2Q) ge 0. Since 3P - 2Q has degree 1, we can only consider functions of the form f(x, y) = ax + by + c. The condition (operatorname{div}(f) + 3P - 2Q) ge 0 implies that f must have a zero of order at least 3 at P and a pole of order at least 2 at Q.

To find g_2 and g_3, we need to transform the given elliptic curve equation into the Weierstrass normal form: y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2x - g_3. To do this, we can perform the following change of variables: x = X - frac{2}{3}, y = Y. Substituting this into the given equation, we get: Y^2 = (X - frac{2}{3})^3 + 2(X - frac{2}{3})^2 + (X - frac{2}{3}). Expanding and simplifying, we obtain: Y^2 = 4X^3 - frac{20}{3}X - frac{32}{27}.

Recall that the Weierstrass wp-function has the property that: wp(z + omega_i) = wp(z), i = 1, 2. Using the addition formula for the Weierstrass wp-function, we can find the half-periods by solving the following system of equations: wp(omega_1) = x_P + frac{2}{3}, wp(omega_2) = x_Q + frac{2}{3}, where x_P = -1 and x_Q = 0 are the x-coordinates of points P and Q respectively.

Then, we have: vartheta(z) = sqrt{-i(x+iy)} sum_{n=-infty}^infty e^{-pi i n^2 / (x+iy)} Since the imaginary part of z is strictly greater than zero, we can use the transformation formula for the theta function: vartheta(z) = sqrt{-iz} vartheta(-1/z) Substituting z = x + iy, we get: vartheta(x+iy) = sqrt{-i(x+iy)} vartheta(-1/(x+iy)) Now, we want to find the maximum value of vartheta(z) for z in the given domain. To do this, we can consider the absolute value of the theta function: |vartheta(z)| = |sqrt{-iz} vartheta(-1/z)| = |sqrt{-iz}| |vartheta(-1/z)| Since |sqrt{-iz}| is always positive, the maximum value of |vartheta(z)| will be achieved when |vartheta(-1/z)| is maximized. Now, let's consider the function g(z) = vartheta(-1/z). We want to find the maximum value of |g(z)| for z = x + iy with 0 < x < 1 and y > 0. Note that g(z) is an entire function, and its maximum value on a compact set is achieved on the boundary of the set. The boundary of the given domain consists of two parts: the vertical line segment from z = i to z = 1+i, and the horizontal line segment from z = i to z = i+y for y > 0. On the vertical line segment, the real part of z is fixed at x = 1, and the imaginary part varies from y = 1 to y to infty. On the horizontal line segment, the imaginary part of z is fixed at y = 1, and the real part varies from x = 0 to x = 1. By the maximum modulus principle, the maximum value of |g(z)| must be achieved on the boundary of the domain. However, since the theta function is an entire function, it cannot have a maximum value on the horizontal line segment, as this would contradict the maximum modulus principle. Therefore, the maximum value of |g(z)| must be achieved on the vertical line segment. Now, let's consider the function h(z) = vartheta(z) on the vertical line segment. Since the theta function is an entire function, the maximum value of |h(z)| must also be achieved on the boundary of the domain. Thus, the maximum value of |vartheta(z)| is achieved when both |h(z)| and |g(z)| are maximized.

Therefore, the maximum value of the theta function in the given domain is achieved when both |h(z)| and |g(z)| are maximized on the vertical line segment.

We can use the projective transformation given by: (x : y : z) mapsto (y : x : z) Applying this transformation to the point (1 : 0 : 0), we get: (1 : 0 : 0) mapsto (0 : 1 : 0) So, the birational transformation that takes (1 : 0 : 1) to (0 : 1 : 0) is the composition of these two transformations: (x : y : z) mapsto (xz : yz : xy) mapsto (y : x : z) c) To find the equation of a line through (1 : 0 : 1) that is tangent to the curve C, we can use the transformation from part (b) to map the curve to a simpler curve, find the tangent line there, and then map the tangent line back to the original curve. Applying the transformation from part (b) to the curve C, we get: F(xz, yz) = (yz)^3 - 3(xz)^2(yz) - 3(yz) = 0 Simplifying, we get: y^3z^3 - 3x^2y^3z - 3y^2z^2 = 0 Now, we can set z = 1 to get a simpler curve: y^3 - 3x^2y - 3y^2 = 0 The point (1 : 0 : 1) is mapped to (0 : 1 : 1) under the transformation. To find the tangent line at this point, we can compute the partial derivatives of the simplified curve equation with respect to x and y: frac{partial F}{partial x} = -6xy frac{partial F}{partial y} = 3y^2 - 3x^2 - 6y Evaluating these partial derivatives at the point (0, 1), we get: frac{partial F}{partial x} = 0 frac{partial F}{partial y} = 3 - 6 = -3 So, the tangent line at this point has the equation: -3(y - 1) = 0 Now, we need to map this line back to the original curve using the inverse of the transformation from part (b). The inverse transformation is given by: (x : y : z) mapsto (yz : xz : xy) Applying this transformation to the line equation, we get: -3((yz) - 1) = 0 Simplifying, we get: 3yz - 3 = 0 So, the equation of the line through (1 : 0 : 1) that is tangent to the curve C is: 3yz - 3 = 0"},{"prompt":"Let X and Y be two varieties defined over an algebraically closed field k.

Since f and f^{-1} are rational functions, they can be represented as quotients of polynomials with coefficients in k. Let f = p(x, y)/q(x, y) and f^{-1} = r(u, v)/s(u, v), where p, q, r, and s are polynomials in k[x, y] and k[u, v], respectively. Now, consider the field extension k(X) / k(f(X)). Since f is a rational function, k(f(X)) is a subfield of k(X). Similarly, k(Y) / k(f^{-1}(Y)) is a field extension, and k(f^{-1}(Y)) is a subfield of k(Y). Since f and f^{-1} are inverses, we have k(f^{-1}(f(X))) = k(X) and k(f(f^{-1}(Y))) = k(Y). By the properties of transcendence degree, we have: trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(f^{-1}(f(X)))) = trdeg_k(k(Y)) + trdeg_k(k(f^{-1}(Y)) / k(Y)). Similarly, trdeg_k(k(Y)) = trdeg_k(k(f(f^{-1}(Y)))) = trdeg_k(k(X)) + trdeg_k(k(f(X)) / k(X)). Comparing these two equations, we get: trdeg_k(k(X)) - trdeg_k(k(Y)) = trdeg_k(k(f(X)) / k(X)) - trdeg_k(k(f^{-1}(Y)) / k(Y)). Since both sides of the equation are integers, and the difference between the transcendence degrees of k(X) and k(Y) is equal to the difference between the transcendence degrees of k(f(X)) / k(X) and k(f^{-1}(Y)) / k(Y), we must have trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(Y)). Now, let's find a rational function f: X --> Y and its inverse f^{-1}: Y --> X for the given example. Let X be the variety defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 and let Y be the line defined by the equation y = x. Consider the rational function f(x, y) = (x + y) / (1 + x * y). We claim that this function maps X to Y. To see this, note that if (x, y) ∈ X, then x^2 + y^2 = 1. Thus, we have: f(x, y) = (x + y) / (1 + x * y) = x / (1 - y) = y / (1 - x). Since f(x, y) = y / (1 - x), we have y = f(x, y) * (1 - x), which is an equation of the form y = x * g(x, y) for some rational function g(x, y). Therefore, f maps X to Y. Now, let's find the inverse function f^{-1}: Y --> X. Let u = x + y and v = 1 + x * y. Then, we have x = (u - y) / (1 + y^2) and y = (u - x) / (1 + x^2). Solving for x and y in terms of u and v, we get: x = (u - v) / (1 - u * v) and y = (u + v) / (1 + u * v). Thus, the inverse function f^{-1}(u, v) = ((u - v) / (1 - u * v), (u + v) / (1 + u * v)) is also a rational function. By the first part of the solution, we have trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(Y)).

Therefore, trdeg_k(k(X)) = trdeg_k(k(Y)) = 1."},{"prompt":"Let X be a variety given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1=0 in projective space P^2.

Let's first find a rational map from X to Y. Consider the map φ: X → Y defined by φ(x, y, z) = (x, y, x + y). Note that this map is well-defined since if (x, y, z) is a point on X, then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, and thus (x, y, x + y) is a point on Y because x + y - (x + y) = 0. Now let's find the inverse map of φ. We want to find a map ψ: Y → X such that ψ(φ(x, y, z)) = (x, y, z) for any point (x, y, z) on X. Consider the map ψ: Y → X defined by ψ(x, y, z) = (x, y, sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)). Note that this map is well-defined since if (x, y, z) is a point on Y, then x + y = z, and thus x^2 + y^2 = z^2 - 2xy. Since z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy, we have 1 - x^2 - y^2 = z^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 2xy, and thus sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2) is well-defined and non-negative. Now let's check that ψ is the inverse map of φ. For any point (x, y, z) on X, we have: ψ(φ(x, y, z)) = ψ(x, y, x + y) = (x, y, sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2)). Since x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, we have z^2 = 1 - x^2 - y^2, and thus z = sqrt(1 - x^2 - y^2). Therefore, ψ(φ(x, y, z)) = (x, y, z), as desired.

Since 1 is a constant polynomial, it has degree 0, and the other two polynomials have degree 1. Thus, f is a rational map. 2. Now, let's compute the inverse map f^{-1}: mathbb{P}^1 dashrightarrow C.

Then, we have f(x(u, v, w), y(u, v, w)) = [x(u, v, w) : y(u, v, w) : 1] = (u : v : w). Comparing the coordinates, we get x(u, v, w) = u, y(u, v, w) = v, and 1 = w.

When we try to evaluate f([0:0:1]), we get f([0:0:1]) = [0:0]. However, this is not a valid point in the projective space Y, as all the coordinates are zero. Therefore, the map f is not defined at the point [0:0:1]. 2. To find a non-empty Zariski open subset of Y over which f is an isomorphism, we need to find an open subset U subseteq Y such that the restriction of f to f^{-1}(U) is an isomorphism.

Two algebraic varieties X and Y are called birationally equivalent if there exist rational functions f: X → Y and g: Y → X such that g(f(x)) = x and f(g(y)) = y for all x in X and y in Y. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of X and Y, except possibly for a lower-dimensional subset. Now, let's consider the singular points of X and Y. Since X and Y are birationally equivalent, we can use the rational functions f and g to map the singular points of X to Y and vice versa. Let S_X be the set of singular points of X, and S_Y be the set of singular points of Y. Then, we have |S_X| = 2 (given in the problem statement) and |S_Y| is the number of singular points of Y that we want to find. Let x1 and x2 be the singular points of X with multiplicities 2 and 3, respectively. Since f and g are rational functions, they can be undefined at some points.

Now, let's consider the inverse image of the singular points of Y under the rational function g. Since g is defined at y1 and y2, we have g(y1) = x1 and g(y2) = x2. Moreover, since g is a rational function, it can have at most a finite number of other singular points in its inverse image. Let's denote the set of these additional singular points by T.

In particular, the union of S_X and T must be finite. Since |S_X| = 2, it follows that |T| must also be finite. Finally, we can find the maximum possible number of singular points of Y.

Let g(x) = ky, where k is a constant to be determined. Then, the equation for the curve Y becomes: (ky)^2 = (x - c)^3 - 5(x - c) + 6 Expanding and simplifying the equation for Y, we get: k^2y^2 = x^3 - 3cx^2 + (3c^2 + 5)x - c^3 - 5c + 6 Now, we want to match the coefficients of the powers of x in the equations for X and Y. Comparing the coefficients, we get the following system of equations: 1. k^2 = 1 (coefficient of y^2) 2. -3c = 0 (coefficient of x^2) 3. 3c^2 + 5 = -5 (coefficient of x) 4. -c^3 - 5c + 6 = 6 (constant term) From equation (2), we get c = 0. Plugging this into equations (3) and (4), we get: 3(0)^2 + 5 = -5 => contradiction - (0)^3 - 5(0) + 6 = 6 => true Since we got a contradiction in equation (3), we cannot find a linear transformation f(x) = x - c that transforms the curve X into the Weierstrass form. However, we can try a more general transformation for f(x) and g(x) to find a suitable transformation."},{"prompt":"One possible numerical problem from birational geometry is the following: Suppose we have a rational curve Csubset mathbb{P}^2 defined as the zero locus of the equation y^2 - x^3 - x^2 = 0.

Hint: Use the fact that C is birationally equivalent to the projective line mathbb{P}^1.","completion":"To find the equation of the unique line passing through two points P_1=(1,1) and P_2=(-1,-1) on the curve C, we can use the point-slope form of a line equation, which is given by: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is one of the points on the line and m is the slope of the line. First, let's find the slope m using the two points P_1 and P_2: m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{-1 - 1}{-1 - 1} = frac{-2}{-2} = 1. Now, we can use the point-slope form with P_1 as (x_1, y_1) and m = 1: y - 1 = 1(x - 1). Simplifying the equation, we get: y = x. So, the equation of the unique line passing through the points P_1 and P_2 on the curve C is y = x."},{"prompt":"One possible question for a math student to solve related to birational geometry and its applications is: Given the equation of a rational curve in the projective plane, find its parametrization. For example, consider the rational curve defined by the equation C: x^2 + y^2 = z^2. To find a parametrization of this curve, we can use the fact that any rational curve in the projective plane can be written as the image of a map varphi : mathbb{P}^1 to mathbb{P}^2, where mathbb{P}^1 is the projective line and mathbb{P}^2 is the projective plane. The map varphi is given by homogeneous coordinates as varphi([s : t]) = [s^2 - t^2 : 2st : s^2 + t^2]. We can check that the image of varphi is contained in the curve C, and that every point on C can be parametrized in this way. Therefore, gamma(t) = varphi([1 : t]) = [1 - t^2 : 2t : 1 + t^2] is a parametrization of C.","completion":"To further verify that this parametrization is correct, we can substitute the expressions for x, y, and z from the parametrization gamma(t) into the equation of the curve C: (1 - t^2)^2 + (2t)^2 = (1 + t^2)^2. Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: (1 - 2t^2 + t^4) + (4t^2) = (1 + 2t^2 + t^4). Cancelling out the terms, we find that the equation holds true: 1 - 2t^2 + t^4 + 4t^2 = 1 + 2t^2 + t^4. Thus, the parametrization gamma(t) = [1 - t^2 : 2t : 1 + t^2] is indeed a valid parametrization of the rational curve C: x^2 + y^2 = z^2."},{"prompt":"Consider two cubics in the projective plane defined by the equations C_1: x^3+y^3+z^3=0 and C_2: x^3+y^3+2z^3=0. Show that C_1 and C_2 are birationally equivalent by finding a rational map phi: mathbb{P}^2 dashrightarrow mathbb{P}^2 which sends C_1 to C_2.","completion":"To find a rational map phi: mathbb{P}^2 dashrightarrow mathbb{P}^2 that sends C_1 to C_2, we need to find a map that transforms the equation of C_1 into the equation of C_2. Let's consider the following map: phi: [x:y:z] mapsto [x:y:z'] where z' = sqrt[3]{2}z. This map is well-defined on the projective plane, since it only changes the third coordinate. Now let's see how this map transforms the equation of C_1: x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 Rightarrow x^3 + y^3 + (sqrt[3]{2}z')^3 = 0 Rightarrow x^3 + y^3 + 2z'^3 = 0 We can see that the equation of C_1 is transformed into the equation of C_2 under this map. Therefore, the rational map phi sends C_1 to C_2. Now we need to show that this map is birational, i.e., there exists an inverse rational map phi^{-1}: mathbb{P}^2 dashrightarrow mathbb{P}^2 that sends C_2 back to C_1. Consider the following map: phi^{-1}: [x:y:z'] mapsto [x:y:z] where z = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{2}}z'. This map is also well-defined on the projective plane.

Therefore, the rational map phi^{-1} sends C_2 back to C_1. Since we have found a rational map phi that sends C_1 to C_2 and its inverse phi^{-1} that sends C_2 back to C_1, we can conclude that C_1 and C_2 are birationally equivalent."},{"prompt":"Let X be a nonsingular cubic curve given by the equation Y^2Z - X^3 - Z^3 = 0 in projective space P^2. Let L be a line in P^2 which intersects X at three distinct points P, Q and R. Find the equation of the unique conic (in P^2) which passes through P, Q, R and is tangent to X at each of these three points.","completion":"Let the line L be given by the equation aX + bY + cZ = 0, where a, b, and c are constants. The points P, Q, and R are the intersection points of the line L and the cubic curve X, so they satisfy both equations. Let's denote the coordinates of P, Q, and R as (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), and (x3, y3, z3), respectively. Since the conic is tangent to the cubic curve X at P, Q, and R, the intersection multiplicity of the conic and the cubic curve at these points must be at least 2. To find the equation of the conic, we can use the following determinant form: C = λL^2 - μX, where λ and μ are constants to be determined. The conic C must pass through P, Q, and R, so we have: λ(aX1 + bY1 + cZ1)^2 - μ(Y1^2Z1 - X1^3 - Z1^3) = 0, λ(aX2 + bY2 + cZ2)^2 - μ(Y2^2Z2 - X2^3 - Z2^3) = 0, λ(aX3 + bY3 + cZ3)^2 - μ(Y3^2Z3 - X3^3 - Z3^3) = 0. This is a system of three linear equations in λ and μ. We can solve this system to find λ and μ, and then substitute them back into the equation for C to obtain the equation of the conic. However, since the conic is tangent to the cubic curve at P, Q, and R, we also need to ensure that the intersection multiplicity is at least 2. To do this, we can compute the partial derivatives of the cubic curve X with respect to X, Y, and Z: ∂X/∂X = -3X^2, ∂X/∂Y = 2YZ, ∂X/∂Z = Y^2 - 3Z^2. Now, we can compute the intersection multiplicity at P, Q, and R by evaluating the partial derivatives at these points and checking that they satisfy the following conditions: (∂X/∂X)(x1, y1, z1) * (aX1 + bY1 + cZ1) + (∂X/∂Y)(x1, y1, z1) * a + (∂X/∂Z)(x1, y1, z1) * c = 0, (∂X/∂X)(x2, y2, z2) * (aX2 + bY2 + cZ2) + (∂X/∂Y)(x2, y2, z2) * a + (∂X/∂Z)(x2, y2, z2) * c = 0, (∂X/∂X)(x3, y3, z3) * (aX3 + bY3 + cZ3) + (∂X/∂Y)(x3, y3, z3) * a + (∂X/∂Z)(x3, y3, z3) * c = 0. If these conditions are satisfied, then the conic C is tangent to the cubic curve X at P, Q, and R. Once we have found λ and μ, we can substitute them back into the equation for C to obtain the equation of the unique conic that passes through P, Q, R and is tangent to X at each of these three points."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},S={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],O={key:0},k={key:1};function K(a,e,s,m,n,h){const u=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),v(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",S,[(o(!0),i(y,null,w(h.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(o(),x(u,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),h.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),i("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
