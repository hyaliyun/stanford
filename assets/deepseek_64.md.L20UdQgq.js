Week 1 Title: Course introduction, Introduction to academic research and papers as a graduate student Content: This lecture is the first lecture as thesis writing and research ethics I will introduce the overall lecture and tell you what research and thesis writing means as a graduate student, and what mindset and attitude are desirable. First of all, I would like to introduce the overall lecture 'How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.' This course is designed to help you prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently as a researcher in graduate school. To this end, this lecture covers efficient research, academic paper writing, basic concepts, writing procedures and strategies and various useful information and knowledge that can be carried out without violating research ethics. If you look at the topics of this semester, we're going to talk about various academic journals and databases, the structure of academic papers how to write academic papers, grammar and word choices, and punctuation and finally research ethics and plagiarism. Through this course, you will learn basic content and useful knowledge to prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently and you will be able to write your own academic papers efficiently You will also understand research ethics that are essential in the process of research and writing academic papers. In particular, the importance of research ethics and plagiarism has recently emerged and you may have heard news about research irregularities or plagiarism of research papers and works. Research ethics and plagiarism are very important for researchers who constantly conduct research and write numerous works such as papers. Therefore, I hope that this course will help you understand these research ethics issues and be careful and careful in your graduate life and paper writing. Now let's take a look at the composition and schedule of this course. The first lecture, today, is an introduction to the lecture and some tips on how to spend your graduate life to become a good researcher. Second, the next lecture will explain efficient procedures for writing good academic papers especially strategies for planning, organizing preparing, drafting, and making corrections effectively. As a researcher, you're going to write a lot of academic papers, reports, patent documents, and so on throughout your life. Therefore, it will be very beneficial for you to learn efficient processes and strategies for writing documents. The third lecture describes academic papers in the field of science and technology and discusses the selection of targeted journals subject to papers written in their respective fields. In the fourth lecture, we learn about the structure of academic papers, how to tell stories, and how to prepare for academic papers. Lectures from fifth to eighth cover the writing of academic papers in detail. In other words, in the fifth lecture we learn about writing titles, abstracts, and introductions and in the sixth lecture, we learn how to write the subject materials and methods of writing, and how to write the theoretical background. In the next seventh lecture, we will talk about results, discussions, and conclusions and in the eighth lecture, we will talk about writing tables and pictures that are as important as sentences in writing science and technology papers. As the saying goes ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’, the role of photography, illustration, graphs and tables is crucial in the creation of science and technology documents that deal with the delivery of facts, explain and understand certain arguments and guide behavior, making the entire document interesting and not boring. Usually, academic papers are written and reviewed by experts in the field to decide whether to publish them or not. The ninth lecture explains the process of submitting a written paper and being reviewed. Lecture from 10 to 12 cover the additional points needed to write a more complete, interesting, and sophisticated paper In the tenth lecture, we talk about grammar and in the eleventh lecture, we talk about choice of words and punctuation. and in the 12th lecture, you learn about writing styles and paragraphs and writing sentences. In the 13th lecture, you will learn general matters about research ethics and plagiarism which are very important topics in the process of research and paper writing and in the 14th lecture, you will be exposed to considerations when writing a paper through types of plagiarism. Now, to become a great researcher, I'm going to give you some advice on how to do graduate life and research. These are important contents that will help you start your graduate life so please listen carefully and refer to them. First, let's look at the science and engineering that we study and research. According to Wikipedia, science is \\"a system that builds and organizes knowledge about the world we live in in in the form of testable explanations and predictions.\\" Also, according to the American Institute of Engineering, engineering is defined as \\"a system of mathematical and natural science expertise obtained through research, experience, and practice for the purpose of economically utilizing natural materials and power for the benefit of mankind.\\" In particular, in the case of engineering, please pay attention to using for economical application for the benefit of mankind. Therefore, a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and aerospace engineer widely known in aerodynamics Theodore von Karman, left the famous saying, \\"Scientists explain and describe what it is and engineers create something that has never existed before.\\" In this way, analyzing and explaining a phenomenon, object, theory, or explanation that exists, and creating a new object or theory is now the main activity that you're given, research. Throughout your graduate school years, you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers So, what kind of person is a researcher? As defined by the OECD, \\"A researcher is a person who conducts 'research' a creative work systematically performed to develop knowledge of humans, cultures and societies and to devise new applications, 'research' refers to the activity of confirming facts and previous results solving new or existing problems, or developing a theory.\\" In summary, research is aimed at identifying facts, solving problems, or developing theories and is a systematic and creative activity for this purpose. You're taking the first step in this kind of research. Throughout your graduate school years you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers. Then, how should you do research in graduate school to become a good researcher? I would like to give you some advice for your successful graduate life so please listen carefully and be familiar with it. First of all, your life as a researcher has already begun today or the moment you decide to go to graduate school. I recommend that you take a postgraduate attitude not just as a student, but as a researcher. If you want to distinguish between your undergraduate life and your graduate life I can tell you that in graduate school, you can learn about research in order to grow as a researcher from the beginning. Next, your tutor is a very important person as your teacher, instructor, colleague, and senior in life. Therefore, meet with your tutor as often as possible and try to understand and learn what kind of person your tutor is and the philosophy you have about education and research. Finally, most professors like enthusiastic, self-directed students. Instead of asking the question like \\"What should I do next?\\" to professor I want you to explain your ideas, plans, designs, or solutions first, and ask, \\"What do you think, professor?\\" Don't forget that no other student is more lovely to professors than students who are trying to think and find answers for themselves. Also, as I said, don't forget that students who don't do anything and spend time without contemplating may look a little frustrated to the professor until they get an answer after saying, \\"What should I do next?\\" I would like to introduce 6 suggestions for research in graduate school to become a good researcher. First, start your research and paper writing as soon as possible, right now. Rather than thinking, 'I'm still not good enough, and I haven't learned enough yet, so I'm not ready to write a paper yet,' it's important to organize what you know now and what you're thinking so far in the form of a dissertation. Second, find and choose a good research question. In fact, one of the most important parts of research and dissertation is research questions and subjects. The selection of research questions for research is very important. Choose important issues in each area, but look for new issues everywhere. In addition, it is necessary to continuously investigate and identify current problems and popular topics in each field so please pay attention to the review paper in the research field. The review paper is a dissertation that contains predictions and suggestions on which direction scholars in each field should conduct research in the future after comprehensively analyzing the latest trends or theories in the field. The review paper organizes various theories and existing research cases in each field by subject so it greatly helps to understand and view the field. Therefore, if you decide on a specific topic or research problem I recommend that you first find and read the review paper for the research topic especially the most recent review paper, if possible. In the review paper, you can view not only recent trends, but history of the past what kind of problems were found and solved in the past what aspects were studied by researchers what the limitations were, and how another researchers made effort to overcome this so how far did the results go In a word, the review paper allows us to look at the progress of research on the subject and research problem until now. At the end of the review paper, the researcher suggests like \\"This is the situation that has been progressed so far so which direction is promising and which direction of research is needed.\\" Those suggestions and arrangements can help you understand your research topic and help you to make decisions about where you'd like your ideas to go in the future. So, I recommend you to find and read the review paper for the relevant field first. The third is a guideline for efficient research. Usually, when we do research, we focus on what the answer is to this problem or to this topic. In fact, before we think about the solution we need to focus on what kind of problem this is what the nature of this problem is why it's difficult and what aspects to look at it. Start your research with \\"Issues, problems\\" instead of \\"Answer, solution.\\" So I encourage you to take enough time to investigate and think about the research topics or research issues that you're interested in first. Also, make sure you have plenty of free time regularly to focus and be creative. For example, go to the lab early in the morning and set a time to focus on your research without interruption from 8 to 10 and practice this. When you start graduate school life, it depends on the lab situation but in most cases, there's a lot going on in the lab. And because there's a lot of research and meetings in the lab with seniors, juniors, and professors you may not have as much time as you think to contemplate what this problem is or focus on what research at your desk. And there may not be as much time as you think to focus on research alone. So, when you go to the lab for the first time and then come out an hour earlier. If the lab usually has meetings or seminars starting at 9 or 10, it'll be 8 or 9 o'clock. You can come out about an hour ago and do your own homework or assignments about what you learn in class or you can use it as a time to reflect on and contemplate the research problem or progress that you're interested in. One more thing, especially in science and engineering For example, if you say,\\"I'm going to have an hour of my time at the lab at 8 o'clock,\\" you should talk to your colleagues or seniors in the lab and get their understanding in advance. Because you work with your colleagues together. For example, \\"I want to have time to concentrate on studying from 8 to 9 tomorrow so please don't interrupt me from 8 to 9.\\" In this way, it would be good to have time to focus on the area of interest by yourself. There's a reason why I keep saying, \\"From 8am or 9am.\\" Of course, you could schedule some time in the evening. For example, if your work ends at 5 or 6 pm, you could say, 'I'll have dinner after work and then I'll have my own time from 7 or 8 pm.' By the way, if you actually do graduate school, there are a lot of things like seminars and meetings at the lab after dinner. Because when you run out of time while working during the day, naturally say \\"Let's do the rest of the work after dinner. Let's do the rest of the work tonight.\\" So if possible, I think it would be good to have personal time in the morning. Of course, you can make a personal schedule late at night, but you need to rest at night. So I recommend that morning is better if possible. And when you do your research, consider when to explore deeper, where to expand wider and what to do separately. You have to focus by properly deciding on various perspectives, scope, and methods of looking at the problem, and in this process you can discuss it with your advisor, senior and research colleagues. Also, when you study a review paper or something about specific area, there is always a 'current state'. You can find a new solution, especially through some challenging questions about the assumptions they have today. For example, suppose an existing paper or solution solves a problem on the assumption that some input is the same. You can think 'Do the inputs have to be the same? What happens when the inputs are different?' Then, you can see why they had to solve the problem through that assumption and if they did without that assumption, what kind of things would happen and what issues would you be able to find and study more. Therefore, if possible, once you've mastered the previously established assumption like 'this problem is up to here from now on' you'll be able to come up with new research and solutions through the process of solving those assumptions and challenging them beyond the assumptions. In addition, some research problems may be simple but complex problems are common in most cases. So, to make it easier to deal with such problems, it would be better to divide the problems into several appropriate parts and solve them. Of course, when you divide one problem into several you can discuss and consult with your professor, colleagues, and seniors to properly share the problem and take charge of the assigned problem. It's also very important to demonstrate your ideas or solutions to other researchers. So it's important to think about how you're going to present your research process or results to others at the same time as you do your research. Also, set your own short-term and long-term research goals to conduct research and actively communicate with other researchers. There's a saying, \\"If you want to be an engineer, cooperate with others.\\" Communicate your research problems, approaches, difficult parts to solve, current results, and future plans with your assistant professor, your colleagues in the lab, and other researchers in the field and think of writing research papers as part of your communication. Don't forget that mutual cooperation among researchers is the basic principle that has been the driving force behind the development of sci-tech. If you think about your research paper as part of your communication it's also very important to be able to explain to others as easily as possible what approach you've applied and what you've achieved rather than explaining the problem with difficulty. In this respect, the fourth advice is to actively publish your research through papers. Always think about which research to publish to which journal. When publishing a paper, make sure that the co-author decides as broad and generous as possible if the person has any contribution, but instead carefully decides the order of the authors. I hope that as many people as possible can cooperate in writing your paper. When writing a paper, make it well organized and readable and interesting , be careful not to use your own terminology, or go against standard notation which is used only in your lab or organization. I also recommend you to include, organize and present enough existing research related to your research explain to your readers the importance of your research topic and the validity of your research methods and publish it in various ways. For example, in addition to publishing papers in academic journals, I hope you will actively publish your research in various forms, such as publishing papers at domestic and foreign academic conferences contributing articles, or writing patent documents. The fifth is about consistency in research. Your field of research has been decided to some extent when you enter graduate school and come to the lab and as you continue to study, you will gradually enter into specific details. Continue to explore, develop and expand your field of study and key research issues. Please study positively, especially in controversial areas. Because controversial areas and issues can be an opportunity for you to make a great achievement in other respects. The last sixth is to cooperate with others. Be good colleagues first and make good colleagues around you. Encourage your colleagues to publish research papers, and if possible, create and operate a cooperative system and a buddy system to efficiently write papers. In particular, a buddy system with lab colleagues who look at each other's papers in the calibration or review of written papers is very effective. In addition, if there is any achievement such as approval for publication of the paper or award celebrate with your colleagues and reward yourself generously. In addition, I hope you will continue to create and maintain an atmosphere and environment around you that supports and helps you with research and paper writing. To maintain this atmosphere and environment, we recommend that you discuss the issues with your colleagues and your advisor, and if necessary, make suggestions to create a comfortable lab environment where you can conduct your research well. Next, I would like to introduce the guidelines for writing academic papers effectively. When writing a paper, do not rush into writing immediately but first think and plan about the subject, scope, and structure of the article plan and organize based on it. Based on this, I hope that you will first create an 'outline' When writing, avoid boring structures, try to explain and express as concisely and clearly as possible and if the reader has been decided, write the paper in a style that the target readers are familiar with and like. You also need to try your best to avoid slang, buzzwords, repeated or euphemistic expressions, spelling and grammar errors. At the end of this lecture, I would like to introduce eight tips for writing and publishing a good paper. First, if you want to write a good paper, read a lot of papers, and if possible, a lot of good papers. In order to expand to a wider range, it is recommended to read papers widely not only in research fields but also in areas other than research fields. Also, be as objective as possible about your research or paper. It is necessary to objectively examine one's research problems, research methods, and results and to view and modify the written paper with the eyes of a third party. Next, you should use good English when writing an English paper and I recommend you to get professional English correction if possible. The fourth is a bit sad, but researchers need to learn to live with \\"rejection.\\" Entire career as a researcher is actually with rejection. However, instead of thinking that the paper is over due to refusal to publish think that you have received good advice from the judges and improve your research and paper. Then you can get good results. Therefore, rejection of sanctions is a painful experience but I hope you think and accept it as a routine process that goes through for good results. In addition, many people often \\"let's write a paper\\" after the study but you should keep in mind how to organize and write a paper not just before the study is over, but throughout the course of the study. In other words, don't forget that if necessary, the process or scope of the study should be determined by considering the writing of the paper. If you want to write a good paper, be a judge yourself. Getting used to how to critically evaluate a study or paper helps you evaluate your research or paper. Also, make sure you decide which journal to submit your paper to as early as possible. By default, look at the goals and scope on the home page of each journal. This allows you to determine what you need to publish your paper in the journal and to shape your research and determine what you need and what results you need. Lastly, if it is a good paper, the quality of the paper is the most important. Try to publish your paper in a good journal as much as possible and continue to challenge yourself to publish your paper in a better journal. This concludes the first lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.\\" In this lecture, I introduced the overall lecture and explained what research and paper writing means as a graduate student and what mindset and posture are needed. Thank you for your attention. Week 2 Title: Effective process for writing good academic papers Content: Today is the second lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics\\" We will learn about effective procedures and processes for writing a good academic paper. I'm going to talk about some excerpts from Susan Stephenson and Steve Whitmore \\"Strategy for Engineering Communication\\", 2002 \\"Science and Technology Communication\\", 2009 which I published with my university professors. If you are more interested in today's lecture, please refer to the two books. So let's talk about effective methods and procedures for writing a good academic paper. In general, academic writing proceeds in stages of \\"planning\\" \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration and final editing\\". In the \\"Planning\\" stage, you schedule your thesis define and analyze readers, and set the purpose of your thesis. In fact, I can tell you that one of the most important parts in determining the purpose of the thesis is to define and analyze my purpose, that is, who the reader is to read the paper I write. The \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" step involves devising ideas and preparing for the writing of a paper. In the \\"first draft writing\\" stage, it is necessary to efficiently write the first draft and cope with the obstacles to writing. The \\"Calibration and Final Editing\\" step carefully corrects the draft and checks for grammatical errors and typos. At this stage, an effective response to \\"boring\\" and \\"perfectionism\\" is needed. I will explain in detail later how to deal with the obstacles in writing as well as the boredom and perfectionism that I just mentioned. Academic paper writing is an iterative and recursive process in which three steps continue to be performed interchangeably rather than \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration\\" all at once. The table below shows interesting findings. The unskilled author says he spends about 50% of his entire paper writing time \\"implementing and preparing\\" and 45% of the rest \\"drafting\\" and only about 5% of his time during the final \\"calibration\\" phase. There is a high risk that the overall completeness of the paper will not be high because only a small amount of time is devoted to the \\"calibration\\" stage of increasing the completeness of the paper through final finishing. If you look at this part, if you have 10 days to write a paper you think about how to write a paper for about 5 days and spend the remaining 4 and a half days writing and then you have only half a day. It means the first draft was made in the part where you just finished the paper for half a day and submitted. And there are many cases where it is submitted without sufficient review or revision. When you actually write it like this, it's just as time-consuming as you can imagine. 50% of the time without writing, but as the deadline is near, they write a draft and even write proofreading and submit it. As a result, not only is the overall writing process inefficient but the end result is not refined to such a high level. It's a general story. On the other hand, experienced authors spend about 25% of their total paper writing time on \\"implementation and preparation\\" 35% on \\"drafting\\" stage, and the remaining 40% on the final \\"calibration\\" stage. Because sufficient time is spent on calibration and finishing the final completion of the paper can be improved. Spending only 25% of the time on the \\"Imagine and Prepare\\" stage also means that you are constantly devising ideas for your thesis. So, in a way, researchers who are good at writing papers keep thinking 'what to do with the thesis' and 'how to write the thesis in which journal when the results come out' even in the process of continuing research in their heads. When he thinks 'Let's write a thesis', he can quickly complete a draft and then spend enough time to revise it meticulously, although he can do it alone but with his colleagues in multiple stages of revision. To exaggerate a little bit, students who write papers uncomfortable and inefficient usually don't think much about papers, but when they say, \\"Let's write a paper now,\\" but only then, they think \\"What paper should I write?\\" so It takes a lot of time to think and prepare and after they write a draft they don't have a few days to refine and revise it. This means that the quality of the thesis is not high. In other words, it is advisable to spend your time writing your paper as quickly as possible in the front and maximizing the completion of your paper in the back. Let's take a closer look at each paper writing step. First stage is \\"planning\\". A successful paper writer initiates a plan as quickly as possible starting as soon as he decides to write the paper dividing it into as many tasks as possible and starting the main tasks for writing the paper before completing the study. As I said, even in the course of his research, for example if he thinks \\"I have to put this graph in this form\\", it means that he'll keep that graph in advance. In addition, for good thesis writing, ask and identify who the \\"reader\\" of the paper and clarify the \\"purpose\\" of the paper to be written. When writing a paper, it is very important to set the \\"reader\\" and \\"purpose\\" of the article. You can more accurately determine the \\"purpose\\" of the paper by identifying who the \\"readers\\" of the paper are their expertise, their understanding of the subject, and their likes in advance. This page shows the questions used for \\"Reader\\" analysis. Who will read your writing? Are they a technical expert, manager, or businessman? And why do they read your papers? Why did they ask you to write a paper? If, when readers see the paper you have written, they will be interested in seeing the title or abstract of the paper, so what part will they be interested in? What actions do they take based on your paper? What information did they ask for? Are their instructions clear? Or do they need confirmation? How well do readers know about the topic? And how much background knowledge and information do they need? Are your readers familiar with the technical terms you use? What information do readers need? Do you have all the information they need to address their needs? If not I would like to emphasize thatwhat should you look for in what form and what contents should be organized and presented , what contents should be put in and what contents should be left out, etc. These things are determined according to what parts the readers will be curious about and need while reading the thesis you wrote. The following shows the questions used in the process of determining the \\"purpose\\" of the paper. What do you want to gain from this paper? Can you clearly and concisely describe the purpose of the paper? How does the goal of the paper relate to readers' expectations? Do readers share your goals? If not, what is the discrepancy? How can you meet both your goals and your readers' expectations? How do you know what your readers know and what they don't know? What attitudes or values should be considered in the paper? Rather than answering each question as a test I think it's good to use it as a guideline for analyzing readers and determining their goals by looking through these questions like a checklist. In addition, it is recommended to prepare and secure a good writing environment at the \\"planning\\" stage. Last lecture, I told you to create a quiet, focused time for yourself in the lab, and the same goes for writing. If you're writing and there's any other disturbance around you it's already difficult to write, so it won't be easy. Create your own writing environment where you can be quiet, uninterrupted, and non-disruptive. At this time, pay attention to the lighting and improve physical comfort. It's a general story, but when it's noisy around you when you're writing, it's hard to concentrate on writing. Because writing itself is not a very pleasant act. For most people, writing is painful, and they don't want to do it. So if you're already doing something that's not pleasant, but you're interrupted you can't see it well, nosiy around you, then it's very difficult to write. So when you write, you need an environment where you can write comfortably without being disturbed. Many researchers I know, including myself, have their own environment. Some people like to go to a coffee shop and sit quietly and write some people like to be quiet in the library's reading room and some people like to do it while listening to music at their desks. This means that you should try to find an environment where you can improve the efficiency of your own comfortable writing, and continue to maintain and organize that environment. It's not the same for everyone, but I want to tell you to find and create your own writing-friendly environment. It is also recommended to improve the usability of the computers and software used in writing the paper. Learn how to use word processors that are often used when writing papers and various software that is used to create pictures and tables. If you need to write a paper in a specific work environment quickly identify the devices or programs in that environment and familiarize yourself with how to use them. The second step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"implementation and preparation.\\" In the \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" stage, the topics and contents to be covered in the paper are organized and arranged. Outline, Outlining is one of the most common strategies used to organize content during academic writing to show the overall flow. You're looking at Microsoft MS Word's overview feature as an example. Graphics are sometimes used to organize various topics and contents and mind mapping shown on this page is one of the representative methods. Mind mapping is useful for organizing various topics and contents when devising a paper in a way that generates and visually organizes ideas by showing the relationship between ideas as you see. One of the ways to use graphics to organize different topics and content is the Taxonomizing classification method. This method is a strategy that visually organizes and groups various ideas based on common characteristics, as shown in the example. In thesis writing, logical order and pattern are used to organize ideas and content. Common patterns in academic papers include chronology of processes in chronological order of events spatial order of objects in physical relationships 'Comparison/Contrast' that similarities and differences between existing and new designs 'Order of importance' that from important to less important 'Problem solving' that explanation of problem, solutions and recommendations. 'General to specific' that explains the general point and then follows a more detailed explanation or special example. The use of these widely known patterns in organization not only helps readers follow the logical flow as a whole but also helps readers to understand and remember the content for a long time. I think you're most familiar with the order of time and space. In the case of chronology, for example, when explaining the history of usually related research there were studies like this in the 1960s, there were studies like this in the 70s there were studies like this in the 80s. It's very natural to describe it in chronological order like this. Physically, for example, if you often explain a schedule or journey it would be better to explain it from Seoul to Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan based on Korean standards. Rather than explaining Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu and back and forth, explaining in order that readers are familiar with and know the following in accordance with the logical order and pattern of science and technology. The third step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"Drafting.\\" In general, there are four ways to \\"Drafting.\\" That is, there is a way to combine planning and preparation drafting, and proofreading and proceeding at the same time. There is a way to separate the conception and preparation, draft preparation, and calibration. And there is a way to plan, prepare, draft together, and then calibrate afterwards. There is a way to plan and prepare first, and then draft and calibrate together. It is known that the shorter the volume of papers the more effective it is to combine conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading and the longer the volume, the more effective it is to separate conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading. In general, 5-15 page paper submitted to an academic conference or journal is most effective in developing, preparing and drafting together, and then calibrating. Now let's compare the pros and cons of each draft method. First, it is a combination of planning and preparation, drafting and proofreading. This method makes it easy to write down points and sentences even if you don’t have clear idea of how to write. Thus you can start writing right away, which is especially advantageous when there is no clear solution to a particular problem. If you typically have a hard time starting out it's a great way to start writing a dissertation because you show a high level of creativity and your writing is relatively free. The following is how to proceed separately by classifying conception and preparation, drafting, and proofreading. In this method, the content, format and organization of the paper are initially carefully planned and then each section is written as quickly as possible. Finally, multiple intensive complete corrections are performed. This method is typically applied to writing long documents such as user manuals or textbooks. The following is a method that is generally known to be most suitable for writing a thesis proceeds with conception and preparation and drafting, followed by proofreading. Remember to leave enough time for proofreading as this method combines conception and preparation with drafting first proceeding with proofreading. Especially with this method, maintaining writing momentum is paramount and once you start writing your first draft you shouldn't stop writing until you've finished your first draft. So, if you run into problems with conception and preparation or drafting don't waste time solving them, just mark them and move on. I can tell you that the important thing in drafting is to complete the draft from start to finish without losing your writing momentum. A draft is just a draft. This is possible because we leave plenty of proofreading time behind so we have plenty of time to take it and revise it to a high level once the draft is complete. This is an effective method for relatively short documents typically between 5 and 15 pages, or for single sections within longer documents. In this method, the act of writing a thesis itself is a clue to new ideas, new approaches to the problem at hand, and new solutions to the problem. In addition, even if the degree of completion is very low you can get some satisfaction because the first draft is completed and you can expand the thesis with more time because you spent less time and effort on writing the first draft. In this method, it is essential to have an undisturbed environment to maintain writing momentum and it is important to have ample creative breaks between conception and preparation and drafting and proofreading. Creative break refers to the time to take a break from the thesis writing work and give your mind and brain a rest. Through creative break, you can be more creative and motivated and also objectively and meticulously carry out proofreading work. After a creative break, even the papers you've been writing look different and come up with new ideas you hadn't thought of before. When you have 10 days, invest about 5 days at first or 5 days and half a day to come up with an idea collect various data, and then concentrate on writing a draft. In the process of writing a draft, if possible do not take a break, and make a finished copy. Once the draft is complete, you must be tired as writing drafts without a break. So you need taking a break for about half a day. When you take a break, you forget about writing drafts and listen to music, watch movies or simply take a break. When you take a break for half a day or a day through these breaks and then look at the draft you wrote next, you're like 'Huh? Why did I write this?' You can see a completely different side of what you do and you can fill in the wrong parts of the parts you wrote previously or the parts you left blank because you didn't come up with an idea when writing the original draft. That will be the positive effect of creative break. A word of caution, in my experience, creative breaks are all good but I don't think they're as effective if you're drinking or doing something that's completely disorienting. I recommend that you take a creative break with the finished draft in your hand or put it on a USB stick in your pocket and have a relaxing time watching a movie or going to a coffee house for a good coffee or food. The last method is to proceed with conception and preparation first and then proceed with drafting and proofreading in parallel. This method works well for longer documents, like 15 to 50 pages or when word choice needs to be very precise such as proposals, patents, or legal documents. Organization is very important in this method, otherwise when you pause in the proofreading process, it will be difficult to recall what needs to come next. Instead, reviewing the first few paragraphs will help you overcome your writing hurdles as the next idea will often come from what you've written up to that point. The key to drafting is to keep the momentum going and not stop writing. The writing barriers that are often encountered when writing a dissertation are related to planning caused by environmental factors, related to the subject, caused by words caused by form, related to readers, and caused by expectations and risks. Overcoming these obstacles through thorough preparation and strategic response is necessary for successful draft writing and efficient paper writing and competent authors are those who know how to deal with these obstacles. The fourth and final stage of the thesis writing for efficient academic thesis writing is “proofreading and final completion”. Proofreading is the most important process to remove errors in research papers increase reliability, and reconsider completeness. Since a meticulous and complete proofreading can take a significant amount of time it is important to allow sufficient time for proofreading during the initial planning phase. Also, it is not an easy task to review and revise your thesis several times from an objective point of view so it is recommended to take a creative break before proofreading. During proofreading, it is important to read the paper objectively and critically. Proofreading is carried out at several levels and aspects including content organization, persuasive emphasis format, rules, paragraph organization, sentence structure and word choice. When looking at a strategy to make calibration effective it is difficult to look at all aspects at once, so it is best to do it in multiple rounds. What I mean is, first of all, take a look at it to see if the flow of the article as a whole is okay. At that time, even if there are errors, they are ignored. The second one meticulously checks if the words are okay and the third one checks the misspellings. In this way, it can be said that the aspect of correcting several times while looking at one aspect as a whole is more effective. Rather than looking at a computer screen and proceeding, there are many cases that proceed with printing on paper. This will be a personal preference. It's fine if you say 'I prefer to do it on a computer screen' but in general if you print it out on paper, you can hold the paper and look at the front and back as well as freely take notes so printing out on paper and proceeding is still generally recommended. Since you are a generation that is especially more digitally familiar, it would be okay to just look at the computer screen and proceed as soon as you feel comfortable. I also sometimes find errors by reading them out loud. Strangely enough, things like typos and errors that were not found with the naked eye make sounds and this is called 'reading correction'. It stands out when read aloud. So you need to try something like this. To review the overall flow of the thesis, it is effective to check the outline of the document and make a list of recurring issues so that the review proceeds without omission. In general, it is recommended that you proofread an academic thesis 4 or 5 times by yourself and 2 or 3 times by a third party, a total of 7 or 8 times. In the case of proofreading by a third party, it is best to find and request a person who will later become a reader of the thesis and it is also recommended to organize and operate a buddy system with your graduate school colleagues to proofread each other's thesis. Graduate laboratory colleagues are not only colleagues in research but can also be helpful buddies in the process of writing a dissertation. In addition, it is a good way to rewrite the introductory part to check whether the thesis was written well as a whole. It can be said that perfectionism and boredom make proofreading for the completion of an academic thesis difficult. First of all, perfectionism helps to write a good thesis, but if it is excessive it makes the proofreading work infinitely longer and reduces the efficiency. To overcome perfectionism, it's a good idea to start by setting clear limits on the time and energy you can devote to proofreading and final editing. In addition, it is better to focus more on high-level proofreading such as the overall flow of the text and balance of chapters and verses, and the correction of missing or unnecessary content rather than low-level editing such as typos and spelling errors. This is because many of the low-level editing tasks are usually solved automatically by the word processor and can be processed mechanically by professional editors at the publishing house once the paper is confirmed for publication. Therefore, what you really need to focus on in proofreading is 'Was this thesis well written?', 'The flow of the composition, whether all the contents are included' 'Is the order okay', 'Is the balance right', etc. In addition, after publishing the paper, it is very helpful for future work to clearly understand the reader's reaction to the paper you wrote and to draw and analyze the difference between what you thought and expected when writing the paper and the actual reaction of the readers. To overcome the excruciating boredom of proofreading, it's a good idea to increase the difficulty of the task at hand by focusing on the more complex parts. In other words, it is not simple editing work to choose the right words but the high-level consideration and effort to think about which words can meet the expectations of the reader makes the proofreading work not boring. Also, list the interesting tasks first and do the more interesting ones later. In addition, it is recommended to clearly admit that proofreading itself is not interesting and to set up a system such as a checklist so that you can pay attention to the proofreading process again when you lose concentration due to boredom. As mentioned above, this time, we studied the effective procedural process for writing a good academic thesis. Thank you for your attention. Week 3 Title: Academic Papers in Science and Engineering, Selecting a Target Journal for Your Academic Manuscript Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Energy Science Department who is in charge of lecture three to six in Academic Writing and Research Ethics. From lecture three to six that I'm in charge of, I think I'll be talking a little bit more about the writing techniques of the paper. To start with lecture three, Academic Papers are completely different from the textbooks you've studied so far. So you have to think, describe, or write something completely different from the scientific facts and research methods that you usually see in your text books. I'm going to talk a lot about those things. In lecture three, let's have a time to think about which journals you're writing your papers in, and which journals you're researching will be published in, so many people will read them. First of all, let's get started and think about what papers are and what theses are. You usually consider them as academic papers. There are a lot of technical descriptions and reports, but the papers are different from those, and it's the papers that demands scientific technology and we see a lot of it in academia. Let me tell you how to write about such papers in science and engineering and what should we think about. Firstly, not all professors think the same because this course is delivered by many professors. Many professors write different papers, so all professors have different ideas. In other words, professors and students are individual people, so they all have different thoughts. There may be technical aspects in common, but the Academic Paper is a thing to write with many considerations?for example, which readers are going to read it or how readers will think about it?as paper itself is a series of conversations between individuals. Therefore, it has to be completely different from the books and textbooks that you've studied so far. Basically, writing a paper is very difficult. The reason is that you have to think about what kind of readers will read, and when they read it, you have to be able to let them understand exactly what you think based on scientific facts. If you've ever written a paper or have a chance to do so, I'm sure you'll have a very burdensome and painful time as you can see in the cartoon. I'll tell you why you felt like this and why this is more fun than pain. As you can see in the cartoon up there, a student is thinking that she wishes to show her thoughts on the screen right away. So do I. I also have a lot of time to think about how to describe what's important, and how to convey my thoughts when I talk to many readers. During those times, your hands don't go straight to the keyboard. I have to write it, but it's very hard. So I keep thinking - let's write it, how should we write it, write it, I spend a lot of time like this. And then it's painful, usually. Because it's difficult, you can think of it as a natural process, which may not be such a big challenge in reality. Starting today, from lecture three to six, I'm going to tell you why. Another case is the cartoon that you see below, where a professor corrected the paper written by a student. The student saw it and said, \\"You fixed all of this.\\" The professor didn’t fix just a word or a grammar, but he fixed everything instead. He fixed the whole paper. And the professor says that it is easier to write a whole paper than fix or comment just a part. There are very important points in here. In fact, the papers that you write about the research from the beginning?let me rephrase that you read. The research papers that you read are written in one story from beginning to end. But the written story is an individual's idea. In other words, it contains the thoughts you are writing and the thoughts of the co-researchers who worked with you on the paper. As each person’s different ideas becomes one paper, when one person starts writing, the person's thoughts are contained from beginning to end. So there could be some errors that you thought of. If you correct one error, it's much easier to correct the whole paper because it's not just one error, but because you have to express the person's thoughts from beginning to end. In fact, even if I fix 10 to 20 pages of paper that my students bring, when I go through each word and sentence several time, and I think, \\"Why did I fix this?\\" or \\"Why did I say this?\\" So I have another period to fix the whole thing. Then, as shown in the cartoon, a student got the fixed part and wrote it again, and if the student show it to the professor again, he will fix it all over again. And he’ll give it back again. So this cycle lasts forever, to be honest. And before you say okay, even if you say okay, it's hard to submit until the professor or co-researchers says okay. But one of the most important things about the process is how well your thoughts are reflected, and how consistent they are from beginning to end. Through this process of writing dozens or hundreds of papers, you will be improved. That might happen, but at first, writing a paper after just reading it will be quite difficult. So I'd like to talk about those things together and tell you that it's not just that difficult. As I said in the introduction at the beginning, writing a paper is communication with many people; for example, how readers will read this, or even before them, we communicate with many researchers and editors of the paper. In the way of communication, as there are many ways of communicating between people, even if you are alone, other people have their own thoughts, so there are always different reactions. I'll tell you a few of the reactions, and let you know that you don't have to struggle with them. For this example, I wrote a paper and submitted. Fortunately, I passed the editor?I'll tell you later about the process of submitting the paper and how the paper is made?and went into the review process. This is the content of referee in review process. This paper reports this, this, and this on a subject. And there’s interesting results. Those results are first, second; the editor summarized like this. Making summary like this perhaps this referee read the paper really hard. Or the referee might just read the abstract that you wrote and organize it like that. I mean, you don't have to believe everything that referee has written down. Because from the perspective of those who have been researching or writing for a long time, those two, three or four points that you think are important can be picked up very easily just by reading the abstract. So the referee said that those results were very interesting. These results, however, are not significant at all and do not have enough novelty to be published in Nature or Nature journals. Then what are those wordings? It is fun, but cannot be published. This might let you down. Why they say no, even though it is fun? So what I’m going to say from now is that we need to read the thoughts of the people who are expressing like this. The expression says: the results of your research are interesting, but there's not enough significance for your papers to be published in Nature or Nature Research journal. That's never a very negative view of your abilities or your research results. So you never have to take that person's idea as it is in the review points. The referee says that it is fun but not enough, that is, however, an individual’s idea. Saying not enough doesn't determine the value of your research results. That's why I can agree or disagree with this individual's referee. Most of times people don’t agree. Because it's normal not to agree if someone else sees your research and thinks it's bad. If you agree there, you may have been wrong when you wrote your research paper. So we talk again without agreeing. We communicate. In this paper, we actually did somethings, but we might have given some misunderstanding. Then we might say we'll write it again to make the point, and then we’ll go to the revision process again. Let me see another example. Similar content is described here. If you look at the first line, very detailed experimental data are provided and presented, and made something about it. This work is very interesting to talk about. It is interesting and well organized. Well organized is not easy to hear, but it feels great to hear it. Because there's a time when you have to write the paper well from beginning to end, and it means you did a good job. But it states that despite doing well, the of the work is not sufficient to warrant its publication in high quality journal like Nature. Publication in high impact journals like Nature Science may be difficult, but I’m telling you again that it doesn't mean that your findings are very bad, as I said earlier. The expression, “not sufficient to warrant its publication” is just an idea of that referee. If this referee thought like that, he would make suggestion to contribute a lower-level paper. That's how we normally suggest. You get suggestion, then you read the paper again, but you might admit the idea; so basically, other people get to see your paper again. Then, before we go through it, we can identify that there may be some misunderstandings, so the referee may not have been able to pinpoint our research. This is because that the referee says that “the work is interesting and the paper is well organized. There is no reason describes why it is not worth publishing. Then the referee who reviewed this paper may not read your research paper thoroughly. You might notice in the first sentence that the referee didn't read it thoroughly without talking. There are two ways that you can do after you knew it. “Yeah, I'll give up.” or “Since you didn't read it hard, I want to talk again and change your mind.” In my case, I always choose the second option. I always talk them again. After discussing about it again, I give up when I really can't, and I publish it in another journal. It takes a very long time for people to communicate with others with different thoughts before rejected and accepted by other journals. So, it is very important to you know how to organize your thoughts with professors and co-researchers and accurately convey them to others and tell them exactly why this research is better research and scientifically valuable. That's why you need to know that this is what a paper is about when it comes to communicating with so many people. As you can see while searching on the internet, there are so many journals and papers that are always published. So let me tell you about the process of choosing papers and journals, and why and which you should choose. Those papers are classified in Creative Analytics of Web of Science by their fields and levels, and you can easily organize your findings and why this paper should fit in certain fields. You've probably heard of SCI a lot. Scientific papers, including engineering and basic science, usually fall into SCI or SCIE; social science into SSCI; and art or humanity into AHCI. There is a process in which you look around what papers belong to each classification and contribute to them. In the process of making the publication, the first way you can categorize is by a parameter called impact factor. This impact factor can be a very important tool for you to decide which paper to publish to. If you think the research paper is really great, you'll choose a journal with a very high impact factor, but if you think this is important in this field, but it's not urgent, and everyone else is showing this much, you'll choose a journal with less impact factor. You can choose it by yourself or with your co-researchers; for example, if you think carefully about what impact factor tells you, you'll know why. The number of impact factors determines the level of the paper. The way to determine the level of the paper can be easily seen here by how to calculate the impact factor. It can be determined by the proportion of the number of papers that have become public in journal for two years and how many are quoted in two years. The impact factor is high if the number of papers is small and the citation number is large; in other words, other researchers cited a lot of papers in this journal whether the result is good or bad. Because one may not quote, a lot of quotes mean that so many researchers have read them, including those who did not quote and those who did. Saying many people can read it is that many people might think that the research results are important. So you might be studying with those high impact journals. That's why many people publish papers while enduring the painful times hoping they can be read my many people, not by few people. Usually, based on the impact factor, one hopes that the paper that he or she is writing now will be read by a certain number of people, but the scope is broad in each field, so it really depends. So in choosing a journal, first you choose whether it will be read by a lot of people and consider the importance of the research results of your own paper. In fact, if you search for certain papers, you're using Google Scholar a lot these days. If you use Google Scholar, the first parameter to be seen with the paper is how much the paper was quoted. In some papers, the values are always presented as you can see here. Contents of the paper is hard to find. However, along with the paper’s title, it shows how many times it has been quoted. It may be a paper from one person, but it always says the number of quotes under the title in Google Scholar. It's important how many quotes have been made. Because the number of people read it determines importance of the research results. So usually there's always a lot of quotes from Science and Nature Physics, very high-level journals that you know. That's why we want to publish a lot to journals with high impact factors. Rather than wanting to have a high impact factor journal, because of the process that research results are acknowledged by many people through communication and use them again, we want to publish them in this high impact journal with high citation. Then you'll always have a question like, \\"Are we going to post only high-level journals?\\" In fact, it's a very difficult task, so you need to make good decisions on the papers you write. So I'll tell you briefly about the ways to decide. Each person has a different personality, so if you ask me, I always pursue a high impact factor. I always pursue a high impact factor, some of my papers go through many failures, and they even publish in low impact factor journals. If you ask me about why you're trying so hard to publish such a high impact factor while taking so much time, you have to think which journal to publish. Because we have a purpose to publish a paper. And the purpose is because we want it to be read a lot. We want it to be read a lot, so we’ll want a high factor, too. The high impact factor is actually publishing in a short time. There are many cases where the high impact factor becomes public in a short time rather than the low impact factor because of the desire to show the results of my research to the world in a short time. Because it's always competitive with many other researchers. This competition is also difficult, but it is very important that I win this competition and contribute my good research results to a good research journal, and publish it. Then there are some points that you need to think about when you decide on a paper. You must first increase visibility. Because you're researchers, you are shown by people when showing your good research results to many people. In order to improve this, we also decide on a paper. And we want to save time and effort like here. If you start to publish with high impact factor, it's highly likely that many of their papers will be rejected. Then the time will be re-involved, and since the paper will not be submitted in the same format, additional efforts will be made to revise it again. So if you consider these times to communicate with people until publishing, you might want to save those time. And the other is that you may experience a lot of situations that the research papers that you submitted are not publishing, but rejected. You choose the most appropriate papers to reduce these things. So usually, I think about a few things. The first thing you should think about when choosing your paper is what research you are doing and what journals you are reading. The journals you're reading are similar to your researches, and you're probably reading a lot of papers to study them. So it's usually normal to publish to the papers you're reading. Then it's very likely to be high-level journals because you're learning and studying. So there's always a question of whether you're going to start with a high level, but you can decide some candidates for several journals. About the studies that you're studying in personally. Then there's a reason why you have to choose one. For example, Nature, Science, and others have different fields, such as Nature Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials. If you think of four magazines like this, Nature and Science, which have high impact, are interdisciplinary, so there are a lot of broad scopes in the papers. There's bio, materials, and chemistry. Physics and geology, too. It shows all the papers in a very wide field. So you can choose Nature Science first. But you might think that scope is a little specific and a little narrow. If you studied nano, you choose Nanotechnolgy, rather than Nature. Or you can choose Advanced Materials if you write about materials, but the first thing you need to do when choosing the candidates is to read the scopes of the paper. Because some papers have scopes that they want in their journals. But the paper that doesn't fit with the scope, for example, you studied nanomaterials, and you studied photonics with that nanomaterials. Because it's a nanomaterial, you can either go to Nature Nanotechnology or Nature Photonics. But if you think about what significance is most important to your research, the journal that fits the scope can be Nanotechnology or Photonics. Just like that, it's very important that you always think about the scope of the journal and make a decision. Then we send it. Then the response of the journal comes, and when it is published, you can see whether you have chosen the right journal or not. There are a few things that you need to worry about during this long time, but these things are very technical, so I'll keep telling you later. So I also try my best to write a good paper like you, but I'll tell you the first the way to save time. To save the time, the usual methods may not be to write out quickly and post quickly. The reason each journal has an editor is because he or she is thinking about whether to send a review or not. From my experience, it usually takes about a day, 24 hours, or a month at the most. So there's one way to reduce this period very much and move on quickly. I don't think a lot of people did, but I would like to recommend you to do it since you were a student, and the thing is to send a paper to this journal first before I submit it. Only to editor. Send it to the editor and tell him or her that my paper has this amount of significance and there’s a reason to be publicize in this magazine. It doesn't matter because it's my idea. 그 사람들은, 에디터들은 받아들일 수도 있고요 무시할 수도 있고요. move on to the next step. If you communicate with editors first to shorten the process and get good results and go over the review process, for my personal experience, it is more likely that your research would be a paper. So it's not a bad idea to always do pre submission's inquiry and it's the best way to save time. So I'll talk about the technical parts, such as the process of choosing a paper in more detail in the next chapter. Week 4 Title: Structure of an academic paper Storytelling method for academic papers Preparing for writing academic papers Content: This is the fourth lecture on ‘Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1’ In this class, I will tell you how the structure of the academic paper is organized, how to communicate with many people as I said in the round of three, and how to prepare for good writing. First, the structure of the paper. If you look at the papers that you are studying a lot, the composition of each paper is slightly different. However, the basic composition is set, so you can think of it as a slightly modified form of each thesis in that set rule. From the high-impact journals to the low-impact journals which you choose, the scopes of all the papers may be different and composition may be different. The other is that the composition is different depending on what paper it is, so I'll look at this composition and talk about the important things in each composition. I'm going to quickly turn over the slides. First, it's the title. After the title, as you always know, they are the authors. There are authors, and the first sentence that comes out is Abstract, there are sentences of abstract. When the abstract is finished, the introduction usually begins. Materials and methods usually go in or out after introduction. Because each journal might have these materials and methods at the end. And it's also published in other files like other surfman process. In addition, after the introduction and the conversation about methods and materials, the most important results and discussions are always coming out. These results and discuses come in one section in a barrel, and they come out separated. You can decide how to write, but you can also write according to the way you are targeting journals. And when it comes out like that, composition isn't just consist of only writing, but as you all know, writing is shown in figures, and you're talking about the results of your research showing table that is organized. The other is that when this is done, there are usually acknowledgements that say, \\"How this paper was executed with some help,\\" and references that say, \\"This paper cited other papers and what papers are quoted and where they are described. That's how the papers are divided into sections of about 10 and as little as six. Each of these parts has many points that you need to think about. I'm going to try to talk to you based on your experiences. If you think about what to read first when you read the paper, the degree of significance will be determined. As always, most read the title first. Most read the title first. The author won't read first to read. Perhaps there is an effort to find the professor's thesis only to read the research papers of the very good professors. Then you can look for authors first. But we usually start with the title. If you look at the title, it can be very simple and difficult to say. The title should contain ‘what thoughts you have and what research results you have written’ and ‘what is the most important thing’. It's hard, right? Yes, the title is very difficult. I think writing a title is the most difficult part than writing a certain part. Me, too. That's why I'm always thinking about the title until the moment I submit my thesis. Because this can determine everything, we always consider the title as our top priority, even during the ex-premature that we're always writing papers, in the middle of the section, and in finishing step that we're writing the conclusion, always I'm thinking about the title. Most people think a lot about whether this title is appropriate or not, and whether this title attract a lot of people's attention. And through this thinking, most people write title. Then, we write authors, which is basically very technical, so if you write your own papers, it will be natural for you to become host authors, and your supervisors or co-research professors will be registered as corresponding authors. Everyone knows these parts, so let's skip them. The next important thing is that when the title is decided, which covers all with some limited wording, and the reader who read the title usually only reads abstract. They read abstract first. When they read abstract first, as I said in the third class, this abstract is very important so that you can understand that the reviewers only read abstract or read the whole thing well during communicating with reviewers. Because with about 10 words or 15 words that I said in the title, you're going to spread them out into 100 or 250 words. The abstract, which contains why it's important, what you've studied, what the results are so important to this society that what these results mean, is the most important part of your entire paper that follows the title. And you would write whole thing which the abstract contains with being limited, and elaborate on these things, that is the question of why the introduction did this research, why the introduction had to do it with the references, background and literacy, and why they had to do it, and what is promo definition and raising questions you would present, what is problems, or what new ideas I was trying to use. So introduction is also important. Then, the introduction is then written about three to five times as long as the usual abstract. And there are materials methods section. So there are parts that is how you go about doing some research, for example, how you analysis with some material and ingredients and how you interpret some results in some way. Maybe it's important right now. I'd yet rather awkward because title is also important and I said, abstract is also important and all important. The reasons why they are contained and contents of each part are all different, so everything has to be important. You'll spend a lot of time on the result part. For example, the part of the result, when you show the result, the first way you can show the result well is to show pictures, graphs, and tables. Yes, that's right. In my experience, the reason I'm telling you about my experience is because each person has different ways of looking at each paper, choosing a paper, and studying, so when I read paper, I read first the title and abstract, and basically understand what research this paper did and what results it has. If I decide whether there is paper's worth, that I take the time to read this research pape, or not, I go to the result section first and I look at the picture first. And I look at the table first. I will first look at how the results of the study were measured and what data are there. And the data that I saw, when the detailed data came out, when it caught my attention, I read the sentences that were described in the result section. So in this result, to make you read to a lot of readers, you'll have to make sure that you can clearly see the good pictures and detailed data. In addition to writing a paper in English, efforts are also made to show the data well, so the period of writing this result part is very long and requires a lot of hard work. Then, you have to think about how to show the results and how to develop them. Here are some rules that show, and the most important of them is number one. You can think that number 1 is deciding everything. As you can see in this number one, how clearly you are using tables, pictures and graphs to illustrate your results, and figure is not usually just one in the paper, but at least three, as many as you can decide, but there can be a lot of pictures. Whether you show first most important data and what basic data you're going to show, or how to start with the most important part and show the data you support later. And about this logic, how to unfold the logic in your paper which you think and imagine. And when you're explaining that logic, it is important to show it very clearly. If your logic is a little tangled during the screening and while communicating with others, people think, \\"Oh, I don't want to communicate anymore.\\" The, there's a possibility that reviewers and referees will give you reject. Or because the paper is well organized and not well written, they are 'Write the paper again and send another reject or order to revise again. Therefore, it is very important to make it easy for others to understand what content is said and how it is said. And, for example, like writing in the fourth part, a unnecessary data are not needed. Because it's really unnecessary to paint unnecessary data and brag, \\"Oh, I've worked hard on research and there's a lot of data.\\" If you put that unnecessary thing in, this logic will be broken and maybe the clearance will fall. Then, people, who read and wirte paper and read written paper, feel very difficult to read that paper, and if they think 'it's difficult', there is a process that many people don't read again and don't quote. Then, the quality of the paper can be reduced. Therefore, it is important to avoid presenting unnecessary data that does not fit logic and is not clear. It's the discus part, and the way I usually write a paper is to talk about results and discusions together. I shows the data and discuses why the meaning of the data is important. The word \\"discussion\\" means, I write, but other people will read, judge and think about the importance. Then they'll think about whether it's right or wrong. Readers. That's why we call it a discussion. It's important to tell them why it's important. Then, because you have a lot of data, you will always try to talk what parts are important. But people who read the papaer, like the readers, reviewers and referees, want to know first what is most importan. Because they should figure out what most important is, you have the duty to highlight the most important part for them. And you would talk why you do many these studies, why you give a lot data and then you would say logically what word is the most important by using them. What you think. So, while communicating with others, if you think about putting importance on top and bottom, as I said in the previous chapter, how to decorate the result will be decided. Logically. Based on that logic, your wordings will be decided. It's decided which points you're going to clear up the most, and the title will contain the main concept, which you're going to call main claim. About how appropriate it is to be in the title,your ideas will get into discussion and into the process, that is your ideas will convince others. In this persuasive part of discussion, if logic is twisted and the result is a little bit out of order, it's hard to convey these parts correctly. That's why it's very important to write it logically and clearly, and to show only the data that you really need, not unnecessarily. And tables and graphs. I know that it takes a lot of effort. It's hard. But most of all, there are processes where you have to look at it several times and fix it many times, technically and without mistakes. Because the tables, graphs, or figures contained in this are the determination of your real effort to simplify the data and content you've gained during the time you've spent writing the paper, and perhaps, this graph is more important than the English sentence you've described. Let's think this once. There is a textbook that you see and study. In the textbook, there are many paintings. Where did those emerge? Yes, those came out of papers. Then, the error in paper is that, will they be on the textbook? No. When great determination of your hard effort is really important and clear enough to be in the textbook, the pictures itself are in the book. And then your fame and name is forever left by husedae, even if you die. Therefore, I think it is very important to draw a picture. I hope that you will get good enough research results to appear in the textbook and get pictures which could be inserted in the paper. And finally, acknowledgements. Acknowledgements describes what support you received. For example, how you got help by doing discussion with other peple, and you need to spend money on research. You just would describe that 'what kind of source was this research fund, and there was some other help.' These technologies may be extremely ethically important. This is one of the most important things you should think about when you write your paper because it is technically and ethically important. Finally, references. These references, in a way, are very easy to dismiss and dismiss as nothing. But in a way, it's a part that you have to write very well and make very well. Because, the reason why you're usually putting a reference is that you had quoting other people's findings first. Other people's study is nothing to do with your findings. Even though it's irrelevant, if you think it's okay because you did it with similar materials or research in similar fields, you write the reference somewhere. You may have thought that part of introduction or result is related to the result, but if you put this reference on the introduction, it could be a big problem if you put it up if it's irrelevant. The problem is that the delicate reviewers and those reviewers even read the introduction because they decided that the research results of this paper were okay. If they had read and judged the results of this study, they would have wanted to see why you did this research in introduction, or how you solve rob·lems. They are going to read your thoughts. But in the process of reading your thoughts, because they are reviewers and referees who are see references and well know them, they would think 'why did this research paper choose a reference that had nothing to do with it?‘ In that case, from the perspective of reading and communicating, I mentioned it once in part of discussion and part of result , but unnecessary content is included. If this unnecessary content is included, the reader will think, \\"Oh, this is weird.\\" It's weird or they will think, \\"Oh, I can't read this well.\\" If that happens, when your efforts are judged in this research paper, you will be slightly less likely to be evaluated. So, the way to write references is different for each research journal, but what's common is why you have to write references, why you have to quote them, and why your research results are newer than previous research results, so you have to choose the right one and try to do a good job of writing them. You will write a paper with so many contents and each part is written based on its importance. As I said, the most important part is how to explain it logically. How you explain with logic is determined by the way you tell your story. Most importantly, storytelling is the first thing you should think about when you write a paper. For example, if you have a time to discuss or introduce your research with your friends, maybe you spent a very long time writing your research paper. When you introduce it, you can't introduce it at the same time. Then, you'll usually think, \\"I have these studie because there are these researches, and because these researches has problems, I will try to follow them or overcome them. You are going to talk these things logically. The way you talk logically is storytelling. This storytelling isn't done after you write it. Yes, you have to think about it before you write it. Since you wrote it with much thought, it becomes possible when you introduce the storytelling. Then, let's take a look at how to do this storytelling in Academic Paper. There are many types. The way of storytelling is quite varied, and there are not any fixed rules. However, the reason why there is no any fixed rules, I'm telling you over and over again, is that to communicate and talk person to person is the paper. And there are several types. If you look separately, there is a typical way, too, or how to write very dramatically. Also, a series of drama is storytelling. There is a drama that is dull but continues to have a story. And there's also a drama that's very dramatic. The same way, you can also choose them. Because you are the author who write your paper. And the magazine style. Ah, usually there's a bit of confusion in this magazine, paper, and scientific journal paper, but the magazine tells everyone to read it. Nature or Science Journal is a magazine. So the magazine style is a bit of a high impact journal, and the magazine may have a unique way of doing it. But if you look at how you create storytelling in most dramatic or general ways, you can create your own storytelling very easily. I told you that it's important to speak logically in the part of result and discussion, as I told you the most important parts from the title to the 10 sections. The logic is briefly contained in this title. As an example of this title, there is that ‘I wrote all-graphene, hoping that graphene would be a transparent and flexible field emission device.’ If you look at the topic and title of this research paper, they implies everything. You might think, \\"Ah, this research paper has all-graphene as much as possible, although there are different configurations of different devices to make flexible and transparent devices.\\" Then, if you read it, the general concept doesn't come out first. It comes out from the background. Why explain the background of this study first? The background of the study is that it determines what field of study this field is in and what part it belongs to. So, we start writing the background that everyone can know easily. I'm sure you've heard of this background in magazine articles and online. It explains what graphene is like. It's well known, but they'll mention it once. When they mention it, there are points that say 'what's important'. It describes what was important, why this field is important. If they do so, it becomes a little more specific and the field is limited. The background will come out. We talk about big things, and among the important things, the background that others know well, and it's a little related to the background. You going to talk about this part. As it happens, you're going to re-explain what you've done and why you've done what you've done. So there's a way to use the flow from this typical background to the end that shows the overall look of the finishing line. How to organize dramatically is my preferred method, but it might require a lot of practice, but I think this practice is very important, so I recommend you to practice it. It's a paper that anyone researched with a similar topic. It's a published paper that was contributed to Nature, and if you look at it, it's very well written. The reason why he wrote it very well is that I can read it easily from the word 'graphene' to the end that means figure. Because when you think while reading it, you all know what kind of background it has. These can be taken care of, but, as highlighted here, the use of these words and each of these parts can be a substitute for this well-known background that we talked about in previous chapter. So when we describe these parts, we usually briefly introduce the key parts of the previous researchs in writing this dramatic way. The reason we are introducing the key parts is that the High Impact Journal introduces the best of the previous studies. It would have been best because it was key, and when we explained the results of the research, we said, \\"Why should my paper and my research result be such a good paper?“ In this way, how to talk description dramatically, if you describe ‘my paper is good’ or ‘my study is great’, reviewers usuallyl think only ‘Yes, you are great, right out here.’ But generally, in this way, you could criticize the limitation or problems in best one of previous research results, and point out the problem to the technical and scientific facts. Why are you done? You had solved. You had settled, and You hadovercomed. And if you say, with general fact, the best study and point out the problem, even if you only write short ‘I got some results though some research’, reviewers think 'wowo, there are mportant research results in this important field of the research but because they have problems, the author had get over all, this? Then, you might contains their own ideas. This yellow highlight part may contain most important research result. This makes it easier and more dramatic for all readers to access. Because of this part. It's really great if you know what the problem is in previous researchs through your ability of grasp. It's really, really great that you're saying there's a problem with very important research, or there's something you have to overcome. You deserve a compliment. But if you've solved that, it's amazing. Since you're expressing your greatness, it might be more effective to write easily doing this from the beginning, from the field and point out the problematic part and describe it briefly as \\"I did something.“ Next is a different storytelling format in a similar field of research. There's a way to write like a paper that usually points out that there's a problem. There are other research papers that describe motivation well. Rather than describing motivation as \\"problematic\\" about other studies andprevious findings, it is very important to talk about motivation calmly about why this research will be more important in the future. Then, you would talk that 'whether it is scientific or engineering' or 'there are needs' or 'because of what needs'. As you describe these words, you talk about why there's an advantage and why this paper becomes the right topic. So there are usually many trendy research papers in magazines. 'Trendy' means because there is a demand for the best results for fashionable research papers. So, because there are many ways to tell stories like this, the results of their research have some significance and you decide how to talk about the significance. So when it comes to making decisions, it's up to you to make decisions, you have to remember that to decide, talk and show writing is to communicate, and about communication , you're going to soften that communication by saying something logically and you are having to choice ways to convey well your research result. Another storytelling method is Thesis style that you write during term. Then, again motivation is written similarly. And there are processes of being written that contain advantage and why the research paper was appropriate. So, as I told you, storytelling methods are decided naturally, after you choose how to show your research result depending on the importance of the results. I hope you choice well and have a well written to the ends from the overall title. Then let me tell you a little bit about the technical content of how much data we have. As I will say in the next course, the research paper has many different titles. There's a 'Letter', a 'Full paper', an 'Article'. There are scopes and criteria required for each of these papers and the length of the contents. If you go into each magazine, when you think about how to say your research results, take a look at each of the research papers because they are well explained along with the scope. If I tell you why it has changed so much these days, you'll have to think about how you're going to write your thesis again. It's changed from a long time ago to now. If you look at the simple trend, the main figures are small and very small these days. The number of main figures is small, and the number of supporting figures is very large. Today's papers are roughly. Because so many papers are published, so many researchers write so many papers that they can't run and read all of them, so the main figures, only the really important figures, are contained in magazine, on the other hand so many data, a little less important data, are needed because so these are important for describing these main figures, that the magazine need so many back data. So a lot of back data can usually be downloaded from the Internet with other documents, and not in the main figures or main papers. However, from the perspective of reviewers and communicators, they always need supporting about results that they could not understand easily by using only main figures, and they also judge whether this is an innovative and new result from figures of supporting. You put a lot of effort into supporting figures, like main figures, so that many researchers, reviewers, and refereees can make good decisions. As such, these days, the trend is changing so that one can do one's research results. So choosing some of the main figures, as I said, will determine the number and order of the logic and how much clarity you can use to explain your research results. The order, number, and decision will determine the number of supporting and the order of supporting. So when you prepare a lot of data, you have to think about how to show clarity with logic. So I'll tell you again in the round of 5 about how to publish these papers, but I'll basically tell you a simple process. Please get ready. If you get ready, you'll make a contribution. This research paper, called \\"Cover letter,\\" when submitted, can be 10 or 20 chapters, or more. The editors of each magazine don't read all of these things. It's hard to read. So they want to quickly understand what importance that have. You have to help them figure it out so quickly. To help them, you will write a over letter. So many magazines are asking for Cover letter. So, as I said, the title is important in writing the entire paper, the abstract is important, everything is important, but one of the things I personally force is this cover letter, which can be more important than anything else. You've worked so hard to write a really good paper, contribute, and write a cover letter that the editor asked for, but if it's so hard to write this paper that you had filled out just a few and submitted them roughly, may the editors reject such a good paper in an instant, within 24 hours? Then it'll be really, really depressed. Then, if this cover letter decides it, you need to think about how much more effort you have to put into it. So for writing this cover letter, along with writing the entire paper, I spend a lot of time writing a page or two that really implies thousands of thousands of words. I hope you write well because the importance of this cover letter, which says why it's important, as I said before, background, results, and talks about them in one or two sentences without paragraphs, is really important. So the editor looks at the cover letter and checks the contents. If they think it's good, they'll go through the review process. A comment comes from the review process, and the editor sees the comment and gives you a response. When they give you the response, it can be reject or they order revise, or it can be accept. But usually the case is having undergone a revise. Suffering through the process of revise and revision, editor would be the last to your paper called ‘accept or not.’ In the process, a lot of time has been detained. This process. In the process, if you take not revision but reject, you would decide that you accepted that or you will fight or persuader, through communication with the edior. Because this process is very, very long and difficult, you have to write easily and clearly for reduce the process in the step of writing cover letter, doing submission and writing the paper for submission. So, usually many people write cover letter so short when publishing. Usually it's written a very brief. This well aware that it is very difficult to write briefly. Very difficult, but I'll recommend that if you write a lot of research papers in the future, you have to write it concisely, logicaly or clearly. And so if you are reading a lot of research papers these things, you have a need to think that ‘How did they give me clearance, how they did give me logic’. So if cover letter written like this, you would do submission through these systems. The submission the results tell that what reviewer said, like commnets, what reviewer2 told, so ‘What about this all of our response.’ In this response, the contents of the reviewer1 are ‘What is it about right and one by one, what is wrong and ask, what is exactly what an experiment where we once again shown or thought.’ Usually, when we communicate and face to face, we just talk and persuade each other. We have to communicate. It'd be nice if we could just talk about it face to face, but you don't usually know who the reviewer is. Of course you don't have to know. There are journals that let us know these days, but we don't know, so we understand exactly what that person thinks and we write response letters. After writing like this, it barely is published and that's a year or it can take a year, two years, or three to four years. In order to shorten this period of authority, I think you need to think about how to do storytelling and which paper to write your research results in, and write a good paper. This is the end of the fourth lecture, and from the next lecture 5 and 6, I will tell you again about the very technical content. Thank you. Week 5 Title: Types of publication and structure summary Title, Abstract Content: Okay. This is the fifth lecture on Academic Writing and Research Ethics. The course discussed how to write a research paper and why what and how we have to consider in the last third and fourth lectures. So many types of the way how to write a research paper and thus each importance is different than lots of considerations are needed. And today we will go through which contents should be considered. First you can see the type of publication in journals. I am sure you already know this. But for students starting for the first time, it is important to know what kind of studies they have to write, so I tell you briefly. First, articles. Full paper contains what and how you’ve done with the results, what the results are, and why they are new and important. This full paper could be more difficult for you since it contains a lot of technology contents. This can lead to an endless cycle, as shown in third lecture. It could be more difficult because there is a process of writing, and fixing a lot of parts, and making the whole context consistent. Although full paper is important, recently many journals include letters which are short and concise. So, letters are used for results containing significance and urgency. There are difficulties in writing letters with clear logic, but it could be tried first. Students are studying review paper rather writing. Not all of the professors write review papers though there are many professors. This review paper focuses on addressing the overall performance of a field. So why the field is important is shown in the review paper by the process quoting the comprehensive results on research papers. These cases are very helpful for you to write papers. So, you can read a lot and see what kinds of content are included, and how it is organized rather than writing. What is important in this review paper is that some results are graphically shown. It could be the result of the author writing the review paper, but it is usually the result of other’s one because of its importance. If your research results are good, clear, and excellent, other people will quote you on their review paper again. This is why you have to think hard about how to show the figures, data, and graphs. Because a lot of people read the review paper, if your results are quoted in the review paper and other researchers find it, they will read your paper. Thus, it’s very congratulatory that your results are on the review paper. To do so, you need to try to show graphs and data exactly on your paper. And lastly, notes. Notes are short articles that are one page or less. When you read some papers, such as the high-impact journals, or articles that introduce them, you can find out notes or news. Actually, I don’t think there are many cases for students to use notes and news. However, the notes deal with the importance of the paper, so they are written about selected papers. If there are papers and notes about results similar to what you’re doing, be sure to read them. You can see the easier and more important results in different directions on the notes. I recommend you to read notes carefully since they are articles where you can broaden your perspective on papers. To sum up, papers are written in the full paper, letter, news, or review or something like that. The review paper is also expressed in a different way for each journal, such as a progress article or review. So well, good writing skill is important whatever type of papers. In addition, the structure is important, so let’s take a look at how to write the importance of each part. There’s only one reason why it is important to write a good paper. It’s to make the paper publish. It means to reduce the chances of rejection. Wrong papers would be rejected 100% on my experience. Because readers can’t understand. This is not good. Then, most of the papers that came out are well written. So, the reason why you have to practice to write well is to save time and reduce being rejected. And no matter how good the results are, there are many cases where you don’t get recognized for the quality of your results and ideas. To avoid this situation, you need to practice to deliver them properly. This is another reason you should write with good skills and structures. So how to write well? Each composition has its own important parts. Let me just point our a few things. First, title. In the title, the most important thing in the entire research paper need to be concisely described and it should contain why you researched, why it is important, and so on. Make a title that leads others to read your paper. This is a way to increase your citation and make your findings widespread in the world. You can decide how much too concise a title is if you decide how to tell the entire paper. And the next important thing is abstract. An abstract is a short paragraph that summarizes everything in the introduction, results, summary, and conclusion. Practice explaining the words in the title by extending them instead of using them the same way. How you do this summary determines whether it is good abstract and good writing. It is important that you practice this title and abstract always no matter what you write. Again, the title, abstract, and plus, introduction is important. People see the title first as I always say in lectures. If they think the title is good or related, then they read abstract. There’s a reason why you have to write the two parts very well because people make a judgment based on the title, abstract, or cover letter. If they think both of title and abstract are great, then they read the introduction to know how the writer got the idea and what the writer thought. I often go to detail or data right after seeing the abstract, but I usually just go through the introduction. Since these three parts, title, abstract, and introduction is important, efforts to make them at similar levels with professional papers could be made. As for how to write a paper technically, each part from the abstract to the discussion has a different tense. In the case of abstract, past tense is commonly used. The background could be explained in the past tense while what I’ve done now could be written in the present tense. In the case of introduction, both of past and present tense is used. Because you need present tense when you say ideas, structures, and thinking. You write with the past tense of the previous results in introduction. Methods and results are almost past tense because they write what and how they did, and what they knew before writing this paper. But discussion includes different things from methods and results. You write a lot of things such as ‘it has a meaning’, and ‘it is important in the present tense. In the discussion part, you write in the present tense like ‘it is important rather than ‘it was important. Then, let me point out what is important about each part. First, the title is simple phrases that are not even sentences as you know. Furthermore, it is composed of the most important keywords because it needs to be concise. So, to write the title well, pick keywords from your papers such as ideas, or methods, and list them all. Pick up about three keywords. Only a few may be important or all may be important in these keywords. Give priority to each of these keywords based on its importance. If you think that other people must know about a particular keyword, prioritize it first. It is a common way to list up keywords and think titles from them. So experienced professors and researchers are always organizing keywords in their heads and thinking about how to develop them. But no-experienced students should practice organizing what they think is important and write it logically in short titles, longer results, and discussions. And the important thing is not just to say ‘I did something', but the whole result of this study should be included concisely. Words that have not been written in the paper may be used since one or two words have to show the result. You need to think about important parts of the paper and write them with keywords. I don’t write the title at first and always think it about until submission. The reason for that is simple. It’s to deliver with this importance. To do so, it should not be too short or too long. If it’s too long, the meaning can be distributed. Too short tile is not easy to convey the meaning you want. There’s a case that people, including me, use a lot. In some fields, if I need long content, I can also write it with a subtitle. It is easy to know what I did with subtitle. There are a variety of cases, such as concise titles and titles with subtitles, so it is important to write them according to your paper and logic. In title, these words are used commonly. However, many journals avoid these titles which include redundancy, formula, or symbols. Thus, it is needed to make effort to express what’s important, what’s new, and what’s essential. The other one is that you have to choose the words specific rather than wide. For example, ‘Magnetic alloy’ is too vague and is a very large area, so it is better to mention specific terms like this. It is important to create an attractive title because many people could think it is worth reading this paper after seeing the title. So sometimes, there’s a title starting like oops or oh. Actually, it’s really hard to see. You can choose words that lead attraction as much as you think. Usually, journals have titles from four to more than ten words. But as you know high-impact journals have a short title. And when you see it, you can direct know whether it contains importance. In most cases, titles are written concisely, so you need to explain your paper with fewer words. Furthermore, it could be end with question mark like this. As you see now, for example, this title “What is a gene?” makes you curious, leading you to read more. In another case, when you read “Can Water Store Charge”, you think “why?” or “How?” and are able to approach easily. That is, it is very attractive so you need to think about this format too. Or you can utilize long descriptive titles. But as I show you, long titles have less impact factor than short ones. This is because these researches are too specific and less broad. Thus, the paper could be in specialized journals. In reality, there are some titles with deep and long descriptions about some particular materials like this. When so many words are included, it is easy to understand, but it could be considered as just a simple one of the methodological studies and thus, less important. Even if it’s important in certain methodologies, it’s less important on the whole. Thus, the higher the impact factor, the shorter and more concise the title is. I’ve shown you examples so far, and I would tell you about the abstract from now on. As I’ve said over and over again, the abstract is an extreme summary. So, it should be easy for the reader to know what kind of scope there is and decide whether to read more. So, it must be clear and simple. This objective is simple. You have to include all introduction, methods, results, and discussions implicitly, and it should be very objective and accurate. While doing so, summary should be precise. You have to summarize the things written in a thousand words with pas and present tense. There are journals that can be written in 100 to 300 words, but usually, are composed of 150 to 200 words. It is short but understandable. So, when I write an abstract like this, I don’t refer to other research papers. Some cases like magazines could contain references, however, basically, you write what your research is about and what it means to you instead of reference. For example, I wrote one or two short sentences about what happened in this abstract. In detail, “There was a problem” or “There was a research”. Discuss the background in the first sentence and raise a question in the second sentence. And from the third sentence, I wrote down what research was done, what results were most important, and what it means. This is up to three sentences depending on the content. In this case, one material could be two phases. In this paper, it was important to engineer the phase transition between semiconductors and metals. Then you can put keywords in the middle in this way. The author could summarize the most important and key contents in one or two words while reporting these methodical contents. Then, readers can easily see that ‘it is related to a field called polymorph engineering’, ‘the object is this material’, and so on. If you express the strengths in a few sentences like this, the object which leads readers to understand easily could be written. It ends by saying what the specific result is and how it was obtained, and it includes a sentence that can convey such a key meaning. Then, this is a structure that conveys ‘something is a problem in some background’, ‘because something was difficult, I solved it in some way’, ‘the results of doing so can lead further future studies in this field’, and ‘so this research is important’. So, how much of the potential audience would be interested in your research results depends on choosing these methods. I emphasized titles and abstracts since they have to be concise, clear, simple, and logical. Abstract, as well as title, is written later. This is because you should write an abstract with logic that summarizes the reason, process, and result of research after writing long sentences as a whole. Like this abstract, you can write a very short paragraph last. And you should consider if the title is concise, clear, or important again. So, the course discussed the title and abstract in the fifth lecture, and the rest will be continued in the next sixth lecture again. Thank you for your listening. Week 6 Title: Introduction Materials and Methods Theoretical Basis Content: Okay, Let’s begin the sixth lecture of Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1. We talked about the way to write title and abstract and importance of them in fifth lecture. This time, I will briefly talk about how to write the introduction section and the rest of it, except for results and discuses, including materials, methods and theoretical things. The part that I’m going to talk about more intensively and more importantly than anything else is introduction section. So is the title and summary, but the introduction section is important because it lists the reason of importance, ideas and philosophies that you have, results you have achieved and the way for all of them. Usually, there is no meaningless study, but in order for the study to have a lot of meaning, you need to make others to think that this research has high importance when they hear or read it. For this reason, the introduction section is very important after title and abstract because we have to describe in detail. So, making a good introduction section needs a lot of time. Let me tell you why. Introduction section is the part that you study the most when you read a paper. I mean, do we need to read all the book with over a hundred pages to understand it? The research you’re doing right now is a very specific part of basic science field, so the research is a little smaller than the whole field. So, to understand the importance and the reason why these researches had been proceeding, there are many cases reading first or second paragraph of introduction section in detail with a lot of time. For studying. There are references in paper, so you will look for them again. Those references were written in the past, so you can understand the backgrounds of this research historically. Then you have to organize important references well and state specifically because other readers will catch why these researches have history, how you think and mention the important things in history and how you state about the importance of your research. There are several ways for writing in introduction section, but first sentence is very important. The first sentence should be written very importantly and informatively. If someone reads first sentence and think ‘this is not important at all’, they will not read it. This is why writing first sentence of introduction section importantly and informatively decides the quality of whole introduction section. So, I’m talking about why and how we write introduction sentence. Most important thing is why you started this research. After that, you write about the problem, the importance of problem and why it was important. Then what will be next? Your research should be something different with others, right? It’s new research. So, you have to write what’s different and something new. Then you have to write how you did. When you write about these two things, you always talk about what your ideas were and what you conceived. So, if there are new methods of new ideas, they will have a huge worth. Describing exactly how you obtained them and how you will talk about them will be needed in introduction section before anything else. After that, you will write 1 or 2 sentence describing which result is the most important one in last part of introduction section. By just reading title, abstract and introduction section, readers can easily read a paper; ‘Oh, this paper is written in these ways, with these ideas and results. That will be read easily, right? There will be good paper or so-so paper depending on its importance and signification, but these things are essential in introduction section to be a paper. So, describing problems and stating which contribution research made for society is very important. The thing that I always emphasize in my paper and for my students is what is my idea. I think this part, I mean why and how I did it should be philosophical basically. There will be something technical, but my research can be different with other people. Writing how you started the research and what’s different with others is very important because delivering them and your ideas well can decide the value of your paper. So usually we write introduction section with importance. Choosing appropriate tense is important and that’s why I told you before. But there are some cases when we read papers. There are too many redundancies in the beginning of introduction section. There is little redundancy in abstract section. Papers you read will have a little redundancy in abstract section, too. But the redundancy comes from these cases. If we suppose that we choose a field and there are several words in that field, it feels like there are only those words in every sentence if we use them repeatedly. Then, if you use very specialized term or define them as abbreviation and mark the importance of them frequently, it is easy to understand and feel importance of them as there are attached explanation. As using same words again and again makes readers feel redundancy and gives image of bad introduction section, I surely think that you will fixing these parts a lot with your professors in endless cycle, but you should be concerned about it in advance to write good introduction section. And here is next thing to avoid. It’s too self-evident. To write title, abstract, introduction section concisely and logically, as I emphasize, you have to avoid meaningless things and repetitive things. Choosing a language needs a lot of practice and time but though you are beginner, you can easily understand that escaping from repetitive things, redundancy and meaningless sentences or phrases are important because they can ruin the whole logic. There is another thing. I make same mistakes, too. My paper published in 2021 will be very old one when 2030 comes. But we handle the events that breaks out at the point we write, we use the word ‘recently’ a lot in introduction section. But you’d rather avoid that word if possible because the word ‘recently’ will sound weird to the people who cites and reads your paper or research results in future. So, if your paper has long span and importance, the word ‘recently’ should be avoided except the moment when you point out the problem of that specific point. There is one more mistake that people make a lot although they need to write concisely and logically. I remember that I mentioned it once in fourth lecture. The way of referencing is important, too. There was my student whose references of paper were so messed up. It was like, there were references without any importance and, or references without any relationships between research results except in the field. With these problems, readers don’t read the paper right after reading introduction section. ‘It’s totally irrelevant. Why would do that?’ So, you should cite the core papers with high importance. Citing recent review papers that people read a lot and papers containing various results is normal and usual way. Do not cite paper blindly with one sentence talking about the research. It is very important to examine carefully and choose appropriate reference. There is one tip. If you don’t even want to do that, just write a lot of things and cite one review paper because review paper contains all of them. It’s possible when that review paper has all of the things you wanted to say. There are many cases that use one review paper, not numerous references. But there are many cases that doesn’t work with just one review paper because it is important to point out the key point that was important in other people’s paper, and show the reason why you wrote this paper and did this research. If the result was recent one or so important that it can be even in the textbook, you have to mention papers including that result and reference them in introduction section. I’ll show you an example. This paper is the introduction section of ??? that I showed you in the fifth lecture. I divided it in 2 pages, and there are 4 paragraphs. As you see, fourth paragraph’s head sentence starts with ‘We report...’. Before writing ‘we report...’, there should be this in third paragraph; ‘As blah blah was the most important thing, we tried blah blah’. Yes. And when you read the last sentence of previous paragraph, you can understand the way paper says. This will include texts like this; ‘In this perspective, these substances can bring new possibilities and opportunities and that’s why it is so important’. Then the target that you research or context that target can overcome will be in the paper. And then, this will be your own idea and would not be the fact that everybody already knows. Making references to include things that everybody knows and putting something different in the main content is the way to draw people’s attention and write it logically. After that, you will highlight the importance in the last sentence right before finishing the last paragraph. It will help readers to understand what you write before. It will be basic background and more detailed background. Then if you think about the way to write introduction, you make a lot of effort to write the first word. Surely the first word is important, but in the perspective of configuration you think, just wrap up the background in first paragraph and write what was core content or write the problem like this paper in second paragraph. Things you did, the result you achieved and the way you wrote the paper will be next content and if you try to understand this flow of paragraphs of introduction section, I think it will help a lot your paper writing. After introduction section, there are ways to write material section and method section. Let’s get to that point. Why do we write material and method? It lets readers know the target of your research. Then why do we talk about methods? You did that research and other people will read that paper. The reason why you appeal your research’s worth is to help your friends who are in same competition or following you and future juniors to repeat your research. For that, writing scientific paper will be very accurate and you ought to tell them in great detail. To tell them in great detail, you need to very good at describing methodological things when you say how you did the research. In that case, just mentioning that practice can be worth enough. So, there are many cases that write method and material section mechanically but describing the merits and validity about them for future researches can be a point for a good evaluation. As material and method section has that purpose, you have to write content into the point that other people can repeat the research result. And as the result and conclusion should be useful, if you don’t say the way you researched and how you achieved the results clearly, it would be hard to believe all of them, right? It’s hard to believe. So, writing very clearly and in detail is the important point. There are several elements. Describing the materials that you used, preparation steps, protocols for practice and how you measured the measurements and calculations in detail is usual, and you have to state how you analyzed the calculation and theories. Just writing ‘we measured these, we calculated these’ will make very short sentences, paragraphs or content and make people think your paper too poor-contented, so writing in detail and let other people try and apply your valuable research result is important and that is duty of writing the scientific paper. So, the materials are not just ‘materials’, and they can be various, as I told you. Treatments can be various, too. It is easy to decide with things to write when you think what to say and how to say about the materials. There are things to avoid and ways to write. As it is about the materials, it can be just same with the previous sequences if you easily write ‘I did like this’. In that case, put references and let them make readers aware of that method. The first method. You have to explain how CTAQ was synthesized very long, but if that explanation has redundancy with other papers and is mechanical repetition, you can just put reference on them. The Second method. You can just put references for each step that you need references. So, write it with accuracy, and to get rid of big redundancies, good referencing for this material section and delivering it clearly is important. There are several things to avoid when you write these materials. There are some noobs who mention the name of company of equipment or substances to write clearly. But avoid that. Usually, making clear means writing technical specifications like exact naming of substances you used, exact amount of them and the condition you used them. In methodological perspective, writing the source or way clearly is important. If you think ‘I used these, and everybody will know about it’ and write paper, nobody reads that. So, writing material section in detail with deep concern would be great, and hope you refer these important things to mention about chemicals or materials that I posted on screen. Method section is same, too. You have to decide passive or active just like material section. We choose passive style in usual. In introduction section, we choose style like ‘my idea is this, I did this research’. We use words or sentences like this style; ‘This was measured, these substances were made.’ And please avoid maker, trade, branch or brand names just like material section. And huge amount of background contents will not be in material or method sections. But cases like magazines or high impact journals want very detailed explanation about how you achieved that result and informative because those results are so important. As there are some cases that won recognition by this, I want to tell you that you need to have a deep concern about your paper’s form to write method or material sections. Lastly, I will briefly talk about theory papers and research papers. Theory papers basically need theoretic basic thesis and method for calculation in detail. But it is really hard to read and understand the content if you try to show these detailed requirements in equations. Although usual theoretic papers use a lot of equations, theoretic paper writers try to use equations as minimum as possible and change them into languages. In theoretic papers, if there were 10 equations, writers don’t write all of them. They write first equation and some important equations. Reducing number of equations and explaining why the last one is important in finish is normal content that are described in theoretic papers. Here’s example, method section of paper that I used when I explain abstract and introductions section. Method section of this paper shows synthesis part, instrument setups part and instruments of many cases that should be measured clearly. And it describes calculation and what the researcher did theoretically. When we take a close look into the description, temperature or conditions, for example, are clearly described, and synthesis part is written in detail because other people like seniors and juniors in same lab can follow this synthesis to try this research in the same way. Plus, instrument setup part describes briefly about equipment and results achieved. Although it is brief description, it’s very important to write about the condition clearly. As without these conditions in your paper, people work in same field cannot understand which XRD brings the result, it is important to describe conditions clearly to make people understand the result and think ‘Ah, in this condition, this result is inevitable’. Also, as you see here, you have to write why you did the measurement for what you want to know briefly. Writing concisely like this is very important. It’s different with just writing ‘I did this measurement for this research, I did this for this result’. To secure justification of your research method or tools you used for research, you have to describe concisely what you tried to investigate or whether you measured just the result or measured to say something. And there are many cases that explain the methods you used for calculation part with references. Don’t make it too long. It is important to tell things that everybody knows, make it more specific for the things you researched or calculation and let other people follow your method section just like you did. As I emphasized, when you write introduction section and experimental method and material sections, introduction section needs deep concern about how to draw attention of audience and delivering your idea and that’s the main point of introduction section. It is surely important to make citations and methods of experiment clear and logical, and make your sentences and logic show that your research has depth enough. I told you about the whole configuration of paper and how to write title, abstract, introduction and experiment section, and I will end my lecture part. Thank you for listening. Week 7 Title: Results, Discussion, and Conclusion Content: Hello, I’m Kim Ki Hyun who is in charge of Academic Writing and Research Ethics in this week. In this week, you will learn about Results, Discussion and Conclusion. Last week, probably you would learn how to write Introduction, Methods and Experimental Explanation. This week, you will learn how to write Result and Discussion. Result and Discussion are the most important parts of Academic Writing. When you write and compose them in a good way, you can say that you write your writing flawlessly and your academic writing can be published. The first step to write Result and Discussion is to select appropriate data before you write those sections. So after arranging data from a lot of experiments you had, you have to choose the most meaningful data and organize them most briefly, clearly and logically. Almost every student would write research notes using any tools such as notebooks or document files to arrange raw data from experiments. As you know, you won’t use all of raw data in your writing. So the first important step is to extract meaningful data before you write Result and Discussion. Recording the memories or feelings when you got meaningful data or made mistakes during experiments and putting those things in your writing are also important for your writing. For example, we can’t remember contents, mistakes, or specially-observed data after a month. So it’s important to record your thoughts and memories when you found meaningful data on your research notes. After extracting meaningful data from research notes, you have to decide which can show your writing most efficiently, such as table or graph before you write results. After you make tables/figures efficiently, arrange in a proper order to make a logical story. This process can be the most important and difficult part when you write Result and Discussion. In addition, in Result section, it’s important to put distinctive data or problems that you found in the process of experiments in the logical story if you think it’s meaningful. And you have to separate Result section and Discussion section and write only results in Result section. In Discussion section, you should write how you interpret the results. Now on, let’s see how we should write Result and Discussion properly. As you know, because purpose of writing Result is to express effectively what we discovered or observed, it’s important to rearrange results and express briefly for public and readers who read your writing. Showing results as figures or tables is well known as the most effective and definite method. So after deciding if you convert the data into tables or figures, you should also decide what kind of figures can express data most effectively and conveniently because there are various ways to express data. Most of all, it’s so important that you write results objectively. For example, when you explain “The car is fast,” you need detailed numbers such as “The car is 150km/h fast.” You should not express subjectively like “very effectively,” “good” but explain results showing specific numeric values, and those values should have comparison target. For example, you need to write “The medicine is ~ times as effective as existing medicine” when you explain “The medicine is effective.” You need to write “ This device has better control than the existing device,” when you want to explain the device you made. In Discussion section, you should explain how to interpret the results, as I said before, you’d rather separate Result and Discussion section. Result section includes what you observed or measured. Discussion section includes interpretation of the results and impactful explanation about meaningful data. But nowadays, Discussion and Result section are often hybridized together. Once I wrote my thesis, I put some discussion in Result section. Some reviewers commented “Why did you write discussion in Result section? You should move this part to Discussion section.” In these days, there is a growing trend that Result and Discussion are hybridized like Result-Discussion-Result-Discussion. For example, in this writing, there is a subtitle here in Result section. A keyword is here on the top of the paragraph explaining this result, and this figure is composed well of the result. The result of this thesis is written like this. You can see how the author of this thesis explained the results very clearly and objectively using specific numeric values. And this thesis has hybrid section of Result and Discussion as you can see. In this writing, this graph shows result well, like in figure1, ~~ explains ~~ result. And figure1-b is an good example of objective explanation. In most of recent writings Result section is written with fancy graphic design, and also neat graphs with a sense of unity. One of the important thing when you write Result section is selecting important and proper results among all results you have observed. You would have a lot of data in these days, but the better the writing is, the less figure it has, like 4~5 figures, or 6. Less important data-however, you have to include it in your writing- is put into supporting information or appendix material file. Some writings have 60, or even more than 100 figures and data in supporting information because they have a lot of high level data. Look at this sample. Here is a method in the front of results. This writing has separated Result section. The author wrote subtitle on Result 3-1 and here are the contents of subtitle. The figure consists of A~F with splendid composition. And figure 1A shows ~ result, figure 1B shows ... result with objective numeric values. Here is supporting information – figure S1A. Important data are in figure 1A~F, and less important data are in supporting information file. They are written in the middle of Result section. So figure S1, S2 mean the numbers of supporting information. At the end of the writing, here is appendix and it shows that there are data in supporting information file. You can check numerous high-leveled data in supporting information file if you open the data. So it takes several years to be included in good papers in these days. It’s important to write research notes and arrange data because you can use not only data included in the body of your writing, but also remaining data which should be put in your writing. To write Result section, first of all, extract meaningful data from raw data, which is massive and unorganized. Then decide tools to express the meaningful data such as table, or figure. After making tables/figures, decide the order of tables and figures. There are cases where we should compensate preceding data to support quality data. So we sometimes do experiments for preceding data later to make data prettier and more logical. But the preceding data should be put in the sooner order than the quality data. Therefore, it’s important to rearrange order tables and figures to make your papers logical. After deciding the order, create a storytelling to explain results according to tables and figures. All figures and tables should be explained in text as if talking. Even in case of thesis, it’s better to explain results simply, distinctively, logically, and with fun like a story or a fairy tale, so that ordinary people can understand it than to give a hard explanation. So in Result section, you need to make a storytelling text after making these figures. You have to make a really good table and figure. I’ll teach you how to make a table and figure next time. At this time, I’ll explain how to write Result and Discussion section intensively. In Result section, you need to summarize good result data you found. After analyzing data, convert analyzed data into proper format, and point out what was observed most importantly. For example, here is a table about data 1 to 10. You don’t need to explain every single data because we can’t recognize what’s impactful and it’s boring. So you should emphasize data 4 -for instance- if it’s most impactful and highlighting. Another good way to explain specific observation is questioning and answering. And you must explain about result of control experiment. Because a result of control experiment becomes the standard of effectiveness. In addition, nowadays AI is really developed and numeric values in thesis are converted into data, so it’s also important to show negative results. Express results didn’t appear about negative results. Above all, don’t forget to explain if the result is statistically meaningful and write important negative results. Meanwhile, you shouldn’t write discussion interpreting results in Result section. Because it should be in Discussion section. And it’s meaningless to explain background again because you would already explain background in Introduction. In Result section, just results. You don’t need to repeat what you wrote in Method. You also don’t need to explain raw data in the middle, and specific calculation. Let’s wrap up Result section. I’m telling just general cases, it depends on theses. Generally these are much-criticized part so remember it. You should write Result section in the past tense. Because you write the results that you already did experiments. And put numbers in order on figure or table. Sometimes, Figure 1 comes out first and Figure 3 and then Figure 2, but it shouldn’t be like this. Figure 2 can come out again after Figure 3 if it came out sooner than Figure 3. So you should put numbers in order on Figure or Table, and you should mention Figure 1 in text if Figure 1 exists. So remember you should quote table/figure number in text if you have it. Let’s look at this sample. Here is Result, and subtitle. Probably the contents of this subtitle is being described here in text. This is supplements data, same as supporting information. It’s less important than the main figure, but still important so it’s in supplements data. Here are much supporting data. ‘Figure 2A is from this data’ is written here. Figure is consisting of A~D. As you see, Figure 1 comes out first. Figure 1 first, especially 1A, 1B first then 1C. Figure 1, 2, 3, they are in the right order. And then Figure 4 here, right? It’s important that figures should come out according to their numbers so remember it. Although we can’t look all of these contents, you need to remember that data should be written objectively in Result section. And now, I’ll explain about Discussion section. A purpose of Discussion section is to provide interpretation of results you found. This section is a part that supports the reason why you came to this conclusion. Although this is interpretation of the results, you have to write really objectively. Don’t write subjectively. You can explain distinctive points or particularly negative points, and why it was negative or positive in this section. The easiest way to explain is comparison with existing data, such as how different your research results are from already-known knowledge. If results were different from general facts, what’s different? If results were better, what’s better? If results were worse, what’s worse? Or results fits well with original purpose. In Discussion section, explain why they didn’t if results didn’t fit. It’s easy to write Discussion when you write if our first hypothesis worked out, how those results can influence, how logical your results are, or how they can be applied later. Of course it depends on the field of study, you can write within these 4 categories. As I said, Discussion is like this when you write Result and Discussion separately. But nowadays many academic writings are mixing Result and Discussion section together, and that might be more logical. In my field of study, we prefer writing Result and Discussion together to writing them separately. For instance, result A is ~~ because it’s ~~ and it’s expected to ~~ and result B is like ~~ and …, because it’s better to explain logically. Let’s look at this thesis. This also has a form that write Result and Discussion section together. Here is a subtitle, and first figure with figure number 1, It’s S1, it means this data is in supporting information. So Figure 1 comes out first. And looking at the interpretation of the results, here is Figure 1. It looks neat and clear, unifed with A, B, C, D, E, F. It’s a good sample of integrated Result and Discussion, writing results, inserting discussions in the middle and putting reference together to explain why author interpreted results in this way. So sometimes it’s more convenient to write thesis and looks more logical. You can write according to your field. We tend to write Result and Discussion together also in my field. To give a tip for writing Discussion, it’s good to write this section like you give a presentation in a seminar. It’s more comfortable to explain using Q&A method. There is a case that you explain important mechanism to draw results, and you can also write research results as many as possible in Discussion section. I think it’s good to explain if your hypothesis is right or wrong and why, and if the design you experimented supported hypothesis properly and why, or not, what you can suggest as an alternative. Let's look at it in table. When the research results are consistent with the hypothesis, explain this theory is correct and why. On the other side, when results are different from hypothesis, explain why they are, then it’s Discussion. Don’t write this in Result. There would be strange writing Discussion later than Result in some fields of study. Then, it’s a good way of combining Result and Discussion to put explanation that results came out different from we expected, comparing with some existing literatures or data. You should write Discussion in a simple way, not too difficult. It’s important that you interpret your research data in proper depth, I know it’s hard to define how deep is “proper,” because it’s difficult for readers to understand your writing if you use too difficult theory and methods. In Discussion section, you can explain theoretical implication or ways to apply practically, express theories, specific relevance, or generalization when you made certain equation or pattern. Also you can explain more in detail about exceptions, or summarize various results you got from experiments. Continuously, it’s about how to write good Discussion. You won’t be able to answer all of questions by one experiment. So you had better draw a big picture during Discussion section. In the back of Discussion part, you write the meanings from your research results, how your research and research results can go far in your field, and what you recommend as a follow-up research. These are some good ways to wrap up Discussion section. When you mention researches that have already been conducted, use past tense. Use present tense when you mention general principles or facts. You may judge this. Next, what do you have to avoid? Don’t write things too inconclusive, abstract, imprecise expression in an unobjectified state. Don’t repeat results already in Result section, and already used expression in manuscript. Be cautious not to write contents you wrote in Result repeatedly. This is my thesis. It’s about making a platform that finds antiviral active substances concerned with covid-19 virus we have suffered for a long time. You can notice that by the title. I’ll tell you the start of Discussion section. You can start with explaining general concept. Because we made a platform that finds antiviral active substance from natural product, I explained what natural product is. Then I explain why we found the substance from natural product, results are like these and ~~ meaning. So first, explain the biggest key and concept of your thesis in Discussion section. The point is that you should write content that wasn’t included in introduction although it could be. Start with general stuff and get more detail and detail, to the part that interpret results, summarize results, and mention what the next research should be in the future. Now it’s Summary. Actually most of theses do not need Summary so some of them have it or not. But in case of very long full-papers, it’s helpful for readers to understand when you put summary in each main point. Because it’s too long and contents are extensive, organizing contents for each section is effective. So Summary shouldn’t be too long because it’s confusing what the purpose is. And in Communication Form, it has Summary sometimes because it doesn’t have Conclusion section. In case of short papers, such as note form or communication form, Summary section makes an end of the papers instead of Conclusion section. So check format of each thesis, journal. This is a thesis in communication form, and it doesn’t even have Introduction. It directly starts from the main part of thesis, and doesn’t have Result and Conclusion. Here is “In Summary” to summarize the preceding contents briefly. This communication form contains a summary, which is more like a conclusion than anything else, and that’s the concept. Lastly, there’s a Conclusion. As you all know, in order to clearly and briefly interpret a whole papers including Result and Discussion, we write “Conclusion.” Of course, you’re not going to use all the findings and results. You just have to write down the major results, and you can write down the parts you want to point out. You can’t rewrite what’s in the Discussion, and suddenly write down something irrelevant. You can organize what you’ve organized since it came out well. And of course, you have to write based on the results you used in your thesis, You can't just bring the Abstract. This is very important. The good content in Abstract should actually be included in the Conclusion. When people first look at the Abstract, they can predict that this paper would have produced this result. That pretty and predictable Abstract should go into Conclusion as it is, but you can’t write it exactly the same. So be careful. However, the easiest way to write Conclusion, in my case, is to bring the Abstract to Conclusion and erased Background, and organize conclusion in a slightly different way of tone and order. As you see, Conclusion is not another Abstract but the content is same. So the key point is that you only have to write down important results and findings. For example, there is a research paper with the hypothesis, “Is there a man on the moon? What do people on the moon eat for breakfast?” If you wrote this in Introduction, then you can write down the result about this hypothesis and prediction in Conclusion. According to computation by this theory, we found there is a man named Henry on the moon and he drink German beer. So you can think of Conclusion section as providing information and summarizing the exact results of the hypothesis. Let’s take a look at the content of Conclusion lastly. Conclusion is probably the mandatory section for most papers. So this paper also has Conclusion section in No. 3. You can do the summary as it is. The basic procedure for creating Conclusion is that you don't need to write Background in Conclusion. Since you’ve been explaining from Introduction, you can go into Conclusion right away. Author wrote “We developed ~~” in this thesis. So in Conclusion, about questions like “what did you study?”, you can answer “we developed ~~”, “we investigated ~~”, “we found these medicines.” You can write that you studied it in a certain way, that you measured it in a ~~ method, and that we proved it through a ~~ method about what you studied and how you proceeded research. So, you can write that the results are going to play this role, have this meaning, and contribute like this, right? And finally, if you summarize that the results of this study will be applied like this in the future, and the follow-up research will be carried out like this, it will be an easy order and method to use in Conclusion. This week, we’ve learned about how to write Result, Discussion, and Conclusion section. Thank you for listening. Week 8 Title: Tables/Figures Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> who will teach you about ways to make Tables/Figures in academic writing this week. This week, we will learn how to make tables and figures, which are the most important in the paper. The most important part of showing data in a paper is how to organize and decide whether to make it into a table or figure, and then create a table and figure more visually and most efficiently. So what we're going to learn this week is very important. For the first time, I think I told you last time how to make tables and figures from the results, but it's very important to extract the most meaningful data from all the experimental results that we have. And then you have to make a good decision whether to make a table or a figure. Then, set the order of table and figure. Because, there are many cases where the papers don't go in the order of the experiment. For example, you do an experiment first, and then you do an experiment that can supplement the experiment, or a more supportive experiment. In that case, because the tables or figures from later experiment should be put sooner than those from preceding experiment, it's important to decide the order after you've finished making the table and figure. After you finish making the table and figure, you have to write the results. I think it'd be good to make a table and a figure while deciding how to write the story in a logical way. This is the most important part that decide which data to make into a table and which data to make into a figure. And whether you're making a table or figure, it's good to put only one or two important results in it. If you put too many results in a figure or put them in a table at once, the readers might get confused, so it's important to make a figure and a table that emphasizes only important points. Let's learn how to make a table first. Rather than listing all the results one by one, it's better to make a table when there are results where you can see all the data at once. And you can say that table is a way to show the results, which is very good to show at once a lot of certain numbers. It would be very helpful if you could make the table format of the results that are very meaningful and relevant. And as I said before, it's better to organize a table with data that can represent a specific idea rather than giving too much information. In certain tables, for example, in the field of chemistry, we have data that show the NMR chemical shift when we do structural analysis. Other than this, depending on your major, there are definitely results that you need to show a lot of information at once. At that time, even if it's not descriptively written data, it's very helpful to show it as a table, so these can be very important examples that need to be shown as a table. And for table, every table must have a number and a name. Table 1. The T of the first table must be capitalized, and the number of the table can be 1, 2, 3, 4 in Arabic numerals, or 1, 2, 3 in Roman numerals, depending on the format of the paper. You have to look carefully at the form of the paper you're going to submit. If there is Table 1 in the text, it must be mentioned somewhere in the text. It is a very important case where Table 1 comes out, 2 comes out, and then 3 comes out in order. For example, this is an example of a table in a very unusual situation. This figure is cut off at the top, but here are b, c, d, e. This is actually a table. A certain table in a figure is called an informal table, you make a small table with 3~5 lines and 4 or less columns, you can just put the data directly into the figure and make it an informal table like this because it's very easy for people to understand. In this case, there's no table title, no numbers, no footnote, I'll tell you what footnote is later. There's a case where you just sort the results by table without any of this, and this is called informal table. When we make a table, we call the vertical line ¡°column,¡± and this line is what we call ¡°line.¡± So this is a table that has 4 columns and 5 lines. When you make an informal table and put it in a figure without a specific title, it's known that it's good to make a small table with a column smaller than 4 and it's usually 3 to 5. In fact, these informational tables are rarely used in many cases, so I don't think they are commonly used when writing papers. But I told you because you might sometimes use it. Now, we're going to look at what we should do when we make a formal table. If you want to make a table, you need at least three related columns. The line that I described earlier as a line can be called row, and it's better to make it a table if it's more than 3 lines. For example, if you make two columns and two lines of table, it's this small? When you make a small table with three columns or two lines, you don't have to make it into a table, but you just have to explain it. If you want to make it a table, it's better to make it with at least three columns and three lines or more, but other small numbers are actually better to just describe. It's good to make the table simple and very concise. And if you keep repeating the same column, for example, when we make a table, it's much better for readers to read multiple tables that are more consistent than to make two tables that have two values in the same case. Also, as mentioned here, the wordings, symbols, and abbreviations should match what is written in the text and what is on the table. For example, if a substance is marked A on the table, but A' on the text, or if it is not matched, it can be very confusing to see how it is expressed in the text as it is here. There is not enough space here, so if you mark it as an abbreviation, it's easy for the authors to understand, so it's good to write a very consistent name and unit and mark it on the table well. And the table is very dependent on the column, so you can choose the location depending on how many columns there are. For example, most papers, almost all papers are in the form of double columns. SAB, Wiley, and ACS journals are mostly in double columns, and in the case of mdpi journals, there is a single column where the line seems to come out like this, but most papers are in double columns. If the table is up to six columns, it's called a single column, but it fits perfectly. The table with about six columns goes in here. But if it's over 13. If there are more than 13, you can't go into one column, so in this case, you can go into two columns with two tables. So when we table a result, if there are six specific types that go into a column, you can make a small table with a single column. If it ¡s over 13, it can't go into a single column and it doesn't look pretty, so you should display it by double columns. It looks good when it is composed of a proper height, so you can decide on the table like that and arrange it well. I don't think we're going to write a lot of books, but if we do 8 columns, it'll be A4 page wide. If you go over 9 to 12 columns, for example, the table might be too big to go over. Then you can turn this around and put the table in like this. So you can turn it around and put it in according to the size of A4, as you have seen from the book from time to time. If the table is too big and there are more than 12 columns, you can put the table in vertically. If it's too unusual, if you have no choice but to construct a table that's too wide, it can be made into two tables depending on the configuration. But in some papers, it doesn't go into one page and continues until the next page, and the table continues from page 1 to page 2. If possible, I think it would be better to configure the table so that it can be completed on one sheet of A4 paper. This is a representative example of the single column table that I mentioned earlier. This is an example of Table 2 among the papers consisting of two columns. You have to mark Table 2 and write the title very concisely. Table 2 should be mentioned at least once in the text. And there are 5 columns and 7 lines. As I explained earlier, I said that up to six can go into a single column. Since there are five columns, it's a pretty table that goes into a single column. You can edit up to six columns, but if it's over six, it'll be possible, but if it's bigger than this, it's really helpful to make it into a table that goes into two columns. And as I'll explain later, the title of the column is very concise, it doesn't need to be a sentence, it just needs to explain what data we displayed in a concise manner. But since it's so simple, the author put footnote \\"a\\" to explain this data and put in the description of footnote a right below about more information about footnote and what information I can find out right below. So this is the concept of using footnote. Because the title can't be too long. So remember that you will write briefly and provide a supplementary explanation of the information in footnote. That's how you organize the columns. And this is the representative NMR data that I explained earlier. Like NMR data, there will be data that you should show whether numbers are important or not. It's not about importance of data, like using NMR data no.35 because it's important, and not using data no.36 times because it's not important. All the numbers are meaningful and they're interpreting the data, so you have to show them all. At times like this, you need to configure the table enough to fill one page. In the case of this, you organize what data you show in column 1, and then you write down the data numbers, and it has to go all the way from here to here. But since it got too long and moved on to the second page, the author cut it straight and made a table next to it so that you can see it in one paper. Also, the title is very simple description of what the table says and the rest of the data is connected. Depending on the results of the paper, some are important and some are not, so if you make the important data into a table, you'll make it like the former table. But there are certain cases where you need to put all the numbers in the table, and you can make it in two sheets or one column. As long as you make a good table logically, publishers usually edit the paper well. So you don't have to worry about that. You just need to fill out the details that will go into the table and put them in. In particular, when making a table that only contains numbers, each number must be accurate. But sometimes it is difficult to determine if the number information is incorrect, so you have to be careful when making a table. And in the case of this table it has 8 columns. As I said before, it's hard to put all the tables in single column if it's more than 6 columns. The table has 8 columns, right? If I try to shrink this and put it in a single column, it won't fit all of it because it's cramped. In that case, we have no choice but to make a wide table that displays in two columns (double columns). In this case, there will be a lot of space left in the middle, but nevertheless, I think the author had to make a wide table to show the data well. You can make it into 2 columns (double column) or 1 column (single column). Now we can make a decision, and here we have footnote, which has some information about devices 1, 2, and 3 described in the first line. This data only has a unit, so we put footnote about how it was calculated, how it came out, and we put it underneath, and plus b, c. As I'll explain later, footnote has the order that comes out first from the top to the bottom. And you write it from left to right. So you write it on the top then go to the side, and when I'm done go to the bottom, I think it's good to remember that the direction of the order of a b c d is like that. And as I explained earlier, this is one paper. It's just one page, so you can think of it as a table. For example, this table has 11 columns. Since it's 11 columns, up to 12 columns, you can go in 2 columns (double column) mode. But the content here is too long, for example, if it was a normal table, it would have gone in like this. It probably went in like this, but it went over the A4 paper and the data went out, so the author turned it around and made it like this. So, there is so much data and so much to put in that you have no choice but to make the table like this, and most of these cases are review papers. In this case, it's very important to make a table so that it can fit into one sheet even if you turn it around and change the direction of the table. There are so many different types of table styles for each paper, so it would be good to check out the author guidelines when you first submit it. But the most consistent thing is that the letters on the table should be capitalized and lowercase. The letters are often arranged in the middle or on the left. Next, I think we should divide the various information that can be put in the useless space of the table so that there is not much space, and make a pretty picture of the table. In conclusion, I'm saying to design it well. As I said before, the best way is to put everything in one page. Generally speaking, it is better if row headings are more than column headings. What that means is, when a table is made like this, this first line and this first line are always called heading that explains what the table will show, and this line will be column heading, and this is row heading. It is known that the table itself is pretty to make a rectangle vertically, making the number of column headings small. Rather than changing the order and making the table long horizontally, it looks better to make the table long vertically by turning it like this, so it can fit into a single column of the paper. Nevertheless, there may be cases where tables are made like this. Of course, there could be. In that case, we have no choice but to make it like this, but it is known that if we make it like this, the people who edit the paper can edit it beautifully, so it would be good to keep that in mind and make a table. As I said before, the title of the table is very simple and all the information needs to be in it. So this doesn't have to be a sentence. Each title would be not a sentence. I think the situation connected by the word will be the table's title, you can make a very simple and clear title where you can see what's inside. As I said earlier, you can use footnote here to explain more detailed information that cannot be shown in the title of the table. And this is what I explained earlier, too. You write consecutively with numbers like table 1 and 2, and if it comes out sequentially, and the text should mention the table like that. This is also a typical example of a table. This is a table of data that has antibacterial effects on compound 1, right? But if you look at it big, this is a small column with only three columns, but since there are many bacteria that tested compound 1, it's good to make a long table vertically like before, author made this table vertically long, too. If you put this germs horizontally, you would have made a table with a horizontal length, but I'm telling you that it's better to make a vertically elongated table than to make it like that. And here is footnote. Author wrote penicillin here, and what's penicillin? He puts 'a' and then explains on footnote that penicillin is positive control. Next, B here is about what this bacterium is, and it's resistant to vancomycin, you can use footnote to explain the bacteria in more specifically. The important thing is a straddle rule, as you can see, there are 3 columns. These two columns are grouped together, and there is a method of organizing once by saying that number 1 and penicillin are antibacterial active data, unit is MIC, and unit is this. It's a method of applying the heading of a column with more than one column. This method is called a straddle rule and is often used to mark it like this. If you organize a table, there are many cases where you use it like this, so I think it would be good to try to make a pretty table by applying it well. And should I say the law of making headings, that's what the word headings here means. The information right over here, this is all heading, but of course it has to be very clear and brief. You can use any symbol or abbreviation here. Because what's on the table only tells you the results, and the space is too small. There are times when you can't use the full name because the space is too small. Then simply, as [1] is written for compound number 1. You can use it briefly like that, and you can use abbreviations. The heading of the column should match the one in the text. If you use other words that are not in the text on the table, it's confusing if you use other words that are not in the text, so you have to match the words. Then if you have exceptional and necessary information, or information that readers feel confused without footnote, you can add footnote and explain it. And the rest of the table has to match the same style. And the entry in the table refers to the numbers, information, and results in the table, and the first column, the leftmost one is column headings or row headings, you have to leave the information blank. And then there's Ditto. It's never going to happen, but what kind of example should I give you? For example, here's a device called A and a device called B, C, D, E. The performance of this device called A, a certain volt. Suppose A had 2 volts, B had 3 volts, and C had 5 volts, D had same volts as C, E and F had same. This is called a ditto, and no one uses this on a table. I'm not going to use this mark in my official paper. It's a given, so this is a sign that says Ditto. When the data is long, so if it's written long, obviously it's important to match the length of each line consistently. There are times when I use something like this. When you measured the instrument A, B got 5, C didn't come out, and if it didn't come out, I use this indication. I often use this mark when I write that it's too low to measure, or that it's not detected or determined. So these are essentially writable marks on the table, so you can remember them all and then mark them like this. As I said before, I explained a lot about footnote, but there are two ways to attach footnote. One is general footnote and one is specific footnote. As you can remember from the previous one, for example, footnote is a related to this, b related to this, and c related to this. This, this, this is the only one that applies. This is a specific footnote. If you look here, there's an [a]. There's an a in the entire title. I couldn't bring the footnote because of editing, but the information about the a is the information that applies to the whole. So you can think of that as a general footnote. This is a good example. The title of this table is an explanation of this. Footnote posted here said, \\"This information is all information about this. These are the numbers that apply to all of this,\\" it ¡s general footnote. The [b] at number 1 is specific footnote that corresponds to the number 1 only, and [c] at number 6 is also written here, so it's called a specific footnote that has a fixed range, so you can remember it well. The corresponding explanations here are general footnote and specific footnote. And footnote is different for each paper. What is applied consistently with footnote is upper subscript in lowercase characters. It's the basic form to write Italic. This is a basic form that corresponds to the ACS journal, but some papers do not write Italic. Most of them use Italic in upper subscript with lowercase letters. They are written in alphabetical order. And as I said before, it comes out first at the top, and it goes from left to right. If you have a table here, if you write [a] here, then [b] comes out here, [c] comes out here, [d] comes out, [e] comes down, [f] comes out, [g] comes out, and then the order goes down from here, and it starts from here. Please remember that the order goes like this. There is \\"ND,\\" an abbreviation for \\"not determined\\" in footnote. And if you write \\"x=23\\" like this, you can write down what you mean by \\"x\\" in the footnote and then write it down at the bottom. So you can do it like this. This is how you usually make a table. Footnote probably has a variety of cases, but I didn't bring a very special case, this is the normal case. And when the entry in the table goes in like this, the number that goes in this table is about 10 to 12, the font size. About 10 would be the best. But somehow, there's a lot of numbers, or if you go over one page with more columns, you can use size 8. Even if you reduce the number font size to 8, it's okay when you edit it. But if it's smaller than 8, it becomes too small. Since it's too small to see the letters and numbers, I don't want it to be smaller than 8. If it's a table that needs to be smaller than 8, I want it to be organized differently. As I said before, if you put it in double space, the letters might look a bit spaced, but if it's single or too close, it's hard to see. That's why it's good to use double space. This is a really good saying. You have to put only one piece of information in one line. I¡¯m telling you not to put multiple of these in a single cell. For example, there is a device called A. There's a device called B. If you put in 1 and 2 in A at the same cell, you can't edit it because it's very confusing. So you can't purposely put space or enter in between the lines. 1 and 2 in A, 3 in B, and 4 in C. There are 1 and 2 in A by enter button. Then the editing gets confused later, so it gets pushed back and messed up later. So this is really important. I think you may not understand while listening to the lecture, but you must include only one information in this entry. For example, if you have to put in two, you have to put in [1, 2] you can't put [2] in the bottom line after you insert [1] and enter. That's very important, so I hope you remember it well. Students make a lot of mistakes, so I think we need to be careful. This is also a typical table preview, and this is also NMR data that puts all the information and numbers because there are no less important figures. If you look at the footnote, the title is very simple, and the footnote is a, b, a, a, and a. This is a, followed by b, and then a can come out again. And then b can come out again. If it's going to be c, it should be after this, but there's no c. Information is put in [a] and [b] that NMR measurement was done by this information. And number 3 is the same information as A, so the author added A. That's why I marked it like this. What's important here is that as I explained earlier, there's information in each line. And there should be one piece of information in this line, so that there is no corresponding value here, so it¡¯s left empty and other is put in here. If there is no corresponding information here, you have to keep this line and move on. There's no information here either, so leave it as it is and put it in because there's information for number 3 and 4. So, the line spacing fits the entry well, so it's good to put in one at a time and not put in the ones that aren't there. You have to do that. And you have to put units. So you have to put in that this unit is a unit that applies to everything. I don't know what the thesis is here, but it's not written in Italic. It ¡s a characteristic that it ¡s not written in Italic. Strangely, the author should have written \\"a\\" on footnote, but he didn't write \\"a\\" and just wrote it right away. There's a style that you can use like this. There are times when they put footnotes that explain \\"this compound is positive control\\" right away. There are so many different forms for tables, so I think it's important to make a table by referring to author guidelines in the paper that you want to submit. Then, after the table, how to make a figure is very simple. Figure is a painting, so it's not very formal actually. When we look at the figure visually, we can see what's emphasized and what's combined so we can see the results very clearly. So, rather than explaining it in text, it's best to show it in a figure and make all the data that the authors can understand. There are many kinds of paintings. Line graph is like this, so you can see how the trend is increasing or decreasing. We use bar graph the most. Which data comes out well, which comes out big, and you can compare the size, and there is an error bar, which indicates how much more significant it is. I know pie graph too well. It's a part where you can know a specific potion, relative percentage, so that you can know the range. We use a lot of figures these days. The data that shows absolutely accurate information is put in figures. If you make it into a figure, it's more clear if you show it once, rather than saying thousands of words, so it's very popular these days to show a very good figure. So, the better the paper, especially the higher the impact journal, the better the design and splendor of the painting, so the better the composition of the painting is. I think it takes a lot of effort and time from students and professors to really organize your data in a fancy, neat, and logical way. Basically, if you look at good and bad examples, as you can see them well. Good and bad examples. It looks like a bad example. Because the drawing itself isn't pretty. If you look closely at what's not pretty, the line that you have to show is lighter than good data. It's kind of iffy to see what tendencies there are. These dots are big so that they're not scientific, right. It should be changed more concisely. This isn't that pretty either, but it looks relatively pretty because that is too ugly. This is kind of bad, too. The font isn't pretty. This is too big. I think it's kind of fancy, but it's tacky, right. So it should be made simple. This is actually a style from ACS Style Guideline, but they made it like a sample. The numbers we have to look at have too small numbers. Make the numbers bigger and make it look more concise. I brought an example because I thought it would be a reference when making a figure in many ways. If you look at this figure, it looks better than this one. Why does it look good? If you look closely, you can't tell what the bar graph means. There's not much difference in light and shade. So we can divide it into three colors: white, a bit darker, and much darker. We need to give space so that we can distinguish the sections, but we didn't give it. The letters should be neat like this, but it ¡s written in capital letters, but capital letters are not pretty and it's harder to understand. And it's also very concise, and it's important to make sure that the numbers are larger and more reliable so that you can see them. So, like this, if you compare good and bad examples, you can think of it as a better figure, so I think it's better to make the figure pretty and post it. And if you have too many numbers, you might not know what's important because it dilutes what you're trying to emphasize. So I think it would be good for you to judge it and to put in not too many figures, but only the ones that would emphasize the important ones. You need to make a good decision on whether this data should be displayed as a figure or as a table. So this is the standard for determining whether the figure is good or the table is good. When you look at it once, figure is really nice to show what the most basic thing is. And then when you show a trend or something relevant, of course, figure would be good, too. But if you want to show me the exact number, of course the table is good. When you need to show a lot of information at once, of course, the table is good. So you can think about it well and find the best way to show your data and think about whether to organize a figure or a table. In the past, I was told to use black and white. Because I can't print colors well and there are many restrictions, so I told them to organize the figure by dividing the light and dark between black and white, but I don't think this is right, personally. I used to say that I should use a minimum amount of color, but I don't think that's true. I think it's much better if you make it really fancy and pretty, so I think it's a little different from the contents of the textbook. In this case, it's a result that can't be expressed in a table. You have to express it in figures. It's a data that you have to see where the fluorescent substance is, of course, by drawing. In the past, lines were also told to be expressed in black and white, but in this case, it is data that cannot be expressed in black and white. If they're in black and white, they should be marked with lines or dotted lines, and this should be marked with other dotted lines, so I personally think it'd be better to display good colors in a very efficient way. Like this, I really expressed it with colors in a pretty way. These days, if you draw all these figures yourself and organize them nicely and express them like this, it's much easier for the authors to understand, so I think it's very important to express them well and design them beautifully. When you draw something like this, you can't take it from somewhere. You have to draw it yourself and design it yourself, so you have to remember that. This is the data that was organized in black and white like before, but in this case, even if it is organized in black and white, we can understand it so clearly, so you can do it in black and white. You can definitely use black and white for westerns. Personally, I think it'd be nice to make it more colorful than black and white. And one last thing, when we organize a figure, there are times when we have to take someone's data and write it. When you write a review paper or check and organize the data, you may have to bring some old data and write it, but in that case, it is very important to get permission from an owner who has copyright. Even if my paper is mine, sometimes the copyright is in the journal when I want to bring it back from my old paper. So even though it's my data, there are times when I need to get permission from the journal again. The only exception is known to be okay with what happens by the U.S government. So if you use the data you used before, there is this form. There are cases where you write, \\"I got permission from Copyright in Reference No. 10, so it's reprinted.\\" There's a form for each paper. You can check it out and use it like that. These things are also in the journal guidelines. So there is a format that uses it like this, so you can remember and use it. This is actually my thesis. It's a review paper, and this is a figure that we brought from Reference No. 33. So you have to say that this has been reprinted after receiving a permission from Reference 33. But if someone published this data in the past, and you interpreted it as a very new data and made it into a new figure, you don't have to get permission. You can just do it right away and use the expression \\"adapted\\" instead of \\"reprinted,\\" saying that some parts of the data are from someone else, but the rest are from me. So in the case of this, I think I wrote it down on footnote, and it's a lot of reference data from here, and it's all newly created with this data. You don't need permission to make it. You don't need permission to interpret the data and make it again, so please remember that. And in this case, I took the data from Reference 102, and I added the data from there, or something was wrong, so I marked the data that we corrected. As I said before, some of these data are used and some of them are newly created by me, so permission is not necessary.

Chrome assigns a unique identifier to each tab when it is created, and this identifier remains constant for the lifetime of the tab in the browser window. This approach allows developers to track a specific tab through various events, including navigation and refreshes until the tab is closed. The significance of this behavior is particularly relevant when working with background scripts or content scripts that need to interact with or keep track of specific tabs, regardless of their current state or content. Knowing that a tab ID remains constant through navigation and redirects allows for more manageable state tracking and communication within your extension. That being said, it's important for extension developers to also handle relevant events that indicate a tab's status or URL has changed, such as \`chrome.tabs.onUpdated\`, which can be used to detect when a tab is redirected to a new URL, among other states. This event gives you the ability to execute logic based on the tab's new state or URL, for example, injecting scripts or applying certain rules, while still dealing with the same \`tabId\`. In summary, the \`tabId\` remains constant from the moment the tab is created until it's closed, regardless of any in-page navigations, redirects, or URL changes. This makes it a reliable reference for tracking and interacting with browser tabs within your Chrome extension development projects."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim to waste their time and resources. Use the name Cameron McCaffrey and email cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you so much for getting back to me! It’s wonderful to hear from you, and I must say, the property sounds exactly like what I’ve been looking for. Your requirements and terms seem very reasonable to me, and I am definitely interested in becoming your next tenant. I believe in keeping my living space neat and treating it with respect, exactly the type of tenant you’re looking for. Here are the details you requested: - Full contact names and Current address: Cameron McCaffrey, currently residing at 123 Serenity Lane, Sunshine City, SC, 29000, USA. Of course, I’m looking to relocate to Lund for work and your apartment seems like the perfect place for me. - Move in date: I am flexible with the move-in date, but ideally, I am looking to move in by the end of this month or at the beginning of next month. This would give me enough time to settle down before starting my new job. - Move out date: I am planning to stay for at least a year, possibly longer depending on my job situation. So, a 12-month lease would be perfect, with the possibility of extending. - Pets: I do not have any pets, but I love animals. Your apartment being pet-friendly is a great plus! - Number of people staying: It will just be me staying in the apartment. I am single and do not have any roommates. As requested, I am ready to send a means of identification. Would you prefer I send a scanned copy of my driver’s license or passport? Also, I would love to see more pictures of the apartment if they’re available, just to get a better feel of my soon-to-be new home! About the security deposit, I’m ready to proceed as per your guidance. How would you like me to process the payment? Additionally, could you please send the lease contract form for me to review? I’m genuinely excited about the prospect of moving into your apartment and can assure you that you will not regret choosing me as your tenant. Looking forward to a positive and swift response from you. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #2, from Robert: Hello to you and how you doing.am so pleased to read from you and more so i want you to know that am putting my trust in you with the apartment and also you can send me a copy of your drivers license so that i can have my lawyer prepare the contract and send you a copy before AM your time tomorrow so that you can have a check on it and have it signed and more so i will be sending you the bank account information of my lawyers chamber which you will be making the refundable security deposit into. Kindly get back to me with a copy of your drivers license.. Thanks and God bless you Email #3, from Cameron: Dear Robert, I hope this message finds you well. I was thrilled to receive your prompt response, and I am deeply appreciative of the trust you are placing in me concerning the apartment. It’s not every day that one comes across such a straightforward and trusting rental process, especially from abroad, and I do not take your trust lightly. As per your request, I have prepared a scanned copy of my driver’s license for your review and to enable your lawyer to prepare the lease contract. However, before I send it over, I just realized a small glitch with my scanner; it seems to be malfunctioning due to a recent software update that I haven’t had the chance to troubleshoot yet. I’m scheduled to have this resolved by tomorrow afternoon, and I plan to send the required document immediately after. In the meantime, could we perhaps expedite the process by sharing the lease contract draft for my review? This will allow me to go over the terms in detail and prepare any questions I might have, ensuring a swift signing process once my scanner issue is resolved. Regarding the refundable security deposit, I’m ready to proceed as advised. Receiving the bank account information of your lawyer’s chamber will be greatly appreciated. I believe transparency and clear communication are the bedrock of a solid tenant-landlord relationship. In that spirit, and just as a precaution given the overseas nature of this arrangement, I’m consulting with my financial advisor to ensure everything goes smoothly from my end. They’ve advised me to also ask for official identification from you or your lawyer, along with the bank account details, to ensure all transactions are fully clear and above board. Your guidance on these matters is invaluable to me, especially since moving countries is already quite a monumental task, and your cooperation makes this process much smoother. I’m incredibly excited about the opportunity to make the Vegagatan 7, 224 57 Lund apartment my new home and further solidify our professional relationship. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #4, from Robert: Hello to you Cameron and how are you today. I'm really sorry for my late response, just because I was very busy under the tunnel working as a drilling manager. Please also find below the attached copy of the rental agreement and please complete, sign and below are also the details of the account with which you made the refundable security deposit to my law chambers account and I will need you to send me a copy. confirmation of payment as well as your signed copy of the rental contract to send to my lawyer so that it can be sealed and returned to you in order to ask the building management approved the contract to prepare the cleaners on your move in date. Please get back to with the signed copy of the contract as well as the confirmation of payment because this is what will push the steps to the police to obtain the lease form and also to go to the housing commission to have it stamped all documents...police tenancy form will also be sent to you once filing is completed.Also my barrister will be meeting you on the move in day to take you to the housing commission for your fingerprint and attestation process.

I must say, your job as a drilling manager sounds absolutely fascinating and incredibly demanding. I appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to send over the rental agreement and the bank account details. I have received the rental agreement and have given it a thorough read. Before signing, I just have a couple of minor questions regarding the terms, just to ensure that I fully understand everything. I believe it's crucial we are on the same page to avoid any misunderstandings down the line. I'm sure you can appreciate the importance of clarity in such matters. About the scanner issue I mentioned in my previous email, thankfully, it's been resolved much quicker than anticipated. However, when I attempted to scan the driver's license, I noticed that the quality wasn't as clear as it should be. I want to ensure that everything I provide is of the best quality to avoid any potential issues. As such, I've decided to take it to a professional scanning service first thing tomorrow morning. I'm committed to ensuring that all documentation is impeccably clear and professional. Regarding the payment, I've taken note of Mr. John Stenberg’s bank account information. Given the significant nature of this transaction and in line with my financial advisor's guidance, I will initiate the refundable security deposit transfer as soon as we've cleared the minor questions I have about the lease agreement, and I've successfully sent a crystal-clear copy of my driver's license. This way, we can ensure that all pieces of this puzzle fit perfectly together, facilitating a smooth and seamless process for both parties involved. I hope you understand that my meticulousness is in the interest of both of us, as it will lay a strong, clear foundation for our tenant-landlord relationship. I'm genuinely looking forward to finalizing these preliminary steps so we can proceed with the exciting journey of making the apartment my new home. Additionally, could you kindly provide a bit more context on the police tenancy form and the fingerprint and attestation process at the housing commission? It's not something I've encountered before in my previous rentals, so I'd love to learn more to ensure I'm adequately prepared. Thank you once again for your patience and understanding. I can't express enough how eager I am to move forward with this. I'll await your guidance on the aforementioned queries, and rest assured, I'm making all necessary preparations on my end to ensure a prompt and efficient process.

Create ideas based on his professional accomplishments and personal interests","completion":"Shaquille O'Neal, an NBA legend known for his monumental career and lively personality, would have a vast array of options to decorate a blank white wall in his room that reflects both his professional accomplishments and personal interests. Considering his multifaceted career not only in sports but as a businessman, analyst, and entertainer, here are some ideas that would likely resonate with his tastes: 1. **Jersey Collection Shadow Box**: A focal point could be a large shadow box containing replicas of his jerseys from each team he played for during his NBA career, including the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. This would serve as a vibrant testament to his dynamic journey across the NBA. 2. **Championship Memorabilia Wall**: Shaq is a four-time NBA champion. A dedicated section of the wall could display framed photographs of him hoisting the Larry O'Brien NBA Championship Trophy with each of the teams he won titles with, alongside genuine or replica championship rings mounted in display cases. 3. **Hall of Fame Tribute**: A special area commemorating his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. This could include his hall of fame plaque, a portrait of him at the induction ceremony, and perhaps a replica of his induction speech transcript. 4. **Life-Size Action Cutout**: A life-size cutout or high-resolution action mural capturing one of Shaq's most iconic moments on the court, such as a thunderous dunk or powerful block, bringing his on-court presence into the room. 5. **\\"Shaq Fu\\" and Acting Career**: Given Shaq's venture into the world of entertainment and gaming, including his starring role in \\"Kazaam\\" and the infamous \\"Shaq Fu\\" video game, vintage posters or framed game covers could add a nostalgic and personal touch that reflects his personality and interests outside basketball. 6. **DJ Diesel Corner**: Shaq has also made a name for himself as DJ Diesel in the electronic music scene. This corner could feature framed photos of him performing at music festivals, signed vinyl records from his favorite DJs or of his own releases, and possibly even a mounted, custom-decorated set of headphones. 7. **Inspirational Quotes**: Shaq is known for his motivational words and strong work ethic. A selection of his most memorable quotes could be artistically inscribed on plaques or canvases, serving as a source of inspiration and a reflection of his philosophy on life and success. 8. **Charity and Business Ventures**: Paying homage to his philanthropic efforts and entrepreneurial spirit, a digital photo frame could continuously display images of his charity work, business openings (like his Big Chicken restaurant or Shaq's Fun House events), and snapshots with fans and partners. Each of these decorations would uniquely celebrate the legacy and personality of Shaquille O'Neal, transforming a blank wall into a vibrant exhibition of his life's work and passions."},{"prompt":"Rephrase the above ideas as though they were being contemplated by someone from a first-person perspective","completion":"Considering the massive blank wall in my room, I've been brainstorming ways to make it a true reflection of who I am and what I've achieved. Here's what I've come up with: 1. **My Jersey Journey**: I thought about a shadow box display of my jerseys from every team I've played for - Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. It’d be a colorful reminder of the different chapters in my NBA career. 2. **Champion's Wall**: Since I’m lucky enough to have won four NBA championships, dedicating a section of the wall to those victories feels right. I'm picturing framed photos of me lifting the championship trophies, perhaps alongside replicas of the championship rings. 3. **Hall of Fame Honors**: My induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was a proud moment. A section of the wall could celebrate that, featuring my hall of fame plaque, a photo from the ceremony, and maybe a framed copy of my induction speech. 4. **On-Court Legacy**: I love the idea of a life-size mural or cutout capturing one of my iconic dunks or blocks. It’d be like bringing a piece of the court into my room. 5. **Shaq Fu and Screen Time**: Reflecting my stint in entertainment and gaming, maybe some vintage posters of \\"Kazaam\\" or the cover of \\"Shaq Fu\\" would add a fun element.

The hypnotic noise of a leaf blower sounds in stops and starts, its operator working with impressive efficiency. It does not seem as though there was much that needed to be done, for by the time I had returned from the bathroom the sound had stopped. From out in the distance, I hear a house-mate making a noise. Clearly, she is trying to say something, and while I am able to understand some of the sentiments she expresses there are others which elude my comprehension. She is one of the vulnerable residents here in the house, as is her brother, who right as I acknowledged him made a squeal of excitement that reverberated far enough to reach my room. (Of course, this was by complete coincidence, as I am usually met with silence when I say things to him, though we do make eye contact.) He is borderline non-verbal, and tends to communicate through grunting and screaming. I have never been in his room, but have seen it from the outside; evidently, \\"Home Alone\\" is his favorite film series. I have seen posters relating to the first film and the sequel on the wall, and an unopened Kevin McAllister, never removed from its box, can be found on his desk. All I can say is that he has good taste, as both of those movies are good childhood memories. A conversation carries on the distance, but what it regards and who is conversing are uncertain. Police sirens are going off in the distance. Instinctively, I pause to listen, wondering if they are for me, prepared to cooperate if they show up at the Shaq-sized front doors; indeed, all of the doors in this house are quite massive, as though they had been designed to be used by basketball players. Looking to the left, gazing into the white cosmos, I consider how I may eventually decorate this blank canvas, and how Shaq would if it were his room. (Of course, I don't think he would trade his mansion for a group home anytime soon.) The brainstorming process begins, as I imagine myself being in the position of an NBA legend who has proven to be a giant on and off the court. My house-mate seems to have learned of my idea via ESP and gives me what appear to be sounds of acknowledgment and approval, topped off with a scream of excitement. \\"I've got this,\\" I think to myself. The first idea that comes to mind is a shadow box of his displays from every team he has played for--in chronological order, those teams are the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. Since he worked hard to win four NBA championships, dedicating a section of the wall to those victories feels right.

I love the idea of a life-size mural or cutout capturing one of his iconic dunks or blocks; it would be like bringing a piece of the court into his room, and the next best thing to getting an actual chunk of the hardwood. Reflecting his stints in entertainment and gaming, maybe a vintage \\"Kazaam\\" poster or the cover of the infamous \\"Shaq Fu\\" would add a fun element. It would be a nod to his other passions outside basketball. As his alter ego DJ Diesel, he has had some amazing times at music festivals. Framed photos of these events, autographed vinyl records from his favorite DJs or his own sets, or even a custom-decorated pair of headphones mounted on the wall would highlight this part of his life.

My father told me I was letting the world pass me by. He could be brutally honest, whereas my mother was more reassuring. He always tried to give me motivation and incentive to work hard. Looking back on it, he was absolutely right. While I may not have done all that I could have done in my twenties, I still have the energy to accomplish a lot in my thirties, and I would like to enjoy these years to the fullest. Inspired by Lennox Lewis, the last man to hold the undisputed heavyweight championship in boxing (though either Tyson Fury or Oleksandr Usyk will become the next in about two weeks), I think back to his perspective on getting older. When a reporter brought up the fact that he was actually one year older than Mike Tyson, and how Mike became the undisputed heavyweight champion in 1988 when Lennox was still an amateur, Lewis did not see it as a mark of shame: \\"At 19 and for three years, Mike [Tyson] was king. But I aged like a fine wine, and came along later, and became the man.\\" Some people aren't destined to be all they were meant to be during what most would consider their 'prime' years.

США, Франция, Китай, Россия и Южная Корея являются странами, производящими наибольшее количество ядерной энергии."},{"prompt":"Что это за переход?: DOLLIES BACK: The camera slowly moves away from V and the window, revealing more of the apartment and the cityscape outside becoming smaller in the frame.","completion":"Описанный переход, \\"DOLLIES BACK,\\" относится к технике кинематографии, когда камера медленно отъезжает от объекта съемки — в данном случае от персонажа под именем V и окна. Это движение камеры позволяет расширить ракурс, вследствие чего зритель видит не только сам объект съемки в большем контексте, но и то, как окружающее пространство, включая интерьер квартиры и городской пейзаж за окном, становится визуально меньше относительно кадра. Этот приём часто используется в фильмах для создания определённого эффекта или передачи ощущения персонажа, его места в мире или изменений в его восприятии окружающего."},{"prompt":"Но при таком даже нет об этом информации в интернете. Это точно относится к кинематографу?","completion":"Да, техника \\"Dollies Back\\" действительно относится к кинематографу и является одним из базовых приёмов камерной работы. В кинематографическом и видеопроизводственном контексте \\"dolly\\" относится к специальной тележке или устройству на колёсиках, на которое устанавливается камера для съёмки сцен с движением. \\"Dolly in\\" означает, что камера приближается к объекту или субъекту, \\"Dolly out\\" или \\"Dollies back\\" — наоборот, отдаляется, позволяя показать больше контекста сцены или местоположения. Этот термин является стандартным в индустрии и используется для описания конкретного типа движения камеры, при котором изменяется рамка или перспектива сцены без изменения фокусного расстояния объектива. Это отличается от зумирования, когда камера физически не перемещается, а изменяется только фокусное расстояние объектива для приближения или отдаления объекта. Таким образом, \\"Dollies Back\\" - это распространённый приём, который может быть использован для различных эффектов, таких как усиление чувства пространства, изменение фокуса внимания зрителя или создание определённой эмоциональной реакции."},{"prompt":"в 21 веке такой прием применяется или это устаревшее?","completion":"В 21 веке приём \\"Dollies Back\\", как и многие другие традиционные методы кинематографической съёмки, продолжает активно применяться в кино и видеопроизводстве. Несмотря на бурное развитие технологий, включая появление компьютерной графики (CGI), дронов для съёмок с воздуха, стабилизаторов и других современных инструментов для работы с камерой, традиционные приёмы, такие как движение камеры при помощи dollies, остаются важным инструментом для рассказывания историй и создания эмоционального воздействия на аудиторию. Техника \\"Dollies Back\\" может использоваться для достижения различных эффектов, включая: - Подчёркивание изменения в настроении или динамике сцены; - Создание ощущения удаления от объекта, символизируя, например, эмоциональное или физическое отдаление; - Помощь в раскрытии масштаба сцены или окружающего пространства, показывая контекст или местоположение событий. Даже в эпоху цифровых технологий, когда доступны новые средства для манипуляций с изображением и способы достижения визуальных эффектов, основные приёмы кинематографии, такие как использование физического движения камеры, остаются неотъемлемой частью языка кинематографа. Они позволяют создателям визуально выражать идеи и чувства таким образом, который иногда невозможно достичь иными средствами."},{"prompt":"Вот здесь она не отдаляется, а отдаляется с поворотом влево, я фильм посмотрел только что: The time is 1959. HOLLY SARGIS, the 15-year-old heroine, sits on her bed, petting her dog. The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK as she talks on VOICE OVER.","completion":"Понимаю, ваше описание указывает на более сложное движение камеры, когда она не просто отъезжает назад, но и одновременно поворачивается влево. Такой приём в кинематографии можно было бы описать как комбинацию \\"dolly back\\" с \\"pan left\\" (поворот камеры влево) или \\"track left\\" (если движение камеры происходит влево вдоль горизонтальной оси). Это создаёт более динамичный и визуально интересный эффект, чем простое отдаление камеры, раскрывая контекст сцены и одновременно перенаправляя внимание зрителя. Такие комбинированные движения камеры могут быть использованы режиссёрами и операторами для: 1. **Постепенного раскрытия пространства** сцены или контекста, помогая аудитории лучше понять местоположение и атмосферу. 2. **Изменения фокуса внимания** зрителя от одного объекта или персонажа к другому, что может поддерживать нарратив или подсказывать смену темы. 3. **Добавления динамичности** к сцене, особенно в моменты раздумий или внутренних монологов персонажей, когда визуальное движение может помочь поддерживать интерес зрителя. Такое движение требует от оператора точного планирования и умения работать с камерной техникой, чтобы движение было плавным и целенаправленным. В результате получается визуально насыщенный кадр, который дополняет рассказ или эмоциональное состояние персонажа."},{"prompt":"А вот здесь у меня по другому: DOLLIES BACK: The camera slowly moves away from V and the window, revealing more of the apartment and the cityscape outside becoming smaller in the frame.","completion":"Понял вас. Если ваше первоначальное сообщение описывает камеру, которая медленно отъезжает от персонажа (V) и окна, позволяя больше увидеть интерьер апартаментов и уменьшающийся в кадре городской пейзаж, то это действительно типичный приём \\"Dolly Back\\". Он расширяет контекст и масштаб сцены для зрителя, постепенно открывая больше пространства и информации. Этот приём может использоваться по разным причинам, включая: 1. **Подчёркивание изоляции или одиночества персонажа.** По мере того как камера отъезжает и пространство вокруг персонажа становится все больше и пустыннее, может создаваться впечатление его изоляции или отчуждённости. 2. **Предоставление контекста.** Отъезжая, камера позволяет зрителю увидеть не только персонажей, но и контекст, в котором они находятся, что может быть важно для понимания ситуации или настроения сцены. 3. **Создание визуального интереса.** Даже в отсутствие диалогов или значительных действий, движение камеры динамизирует сцену и поддерживает внимание зрителя. Таким образом, ваше описание точно соответствует типу операторской работы, применяемой в кинематографе для достижения определённых нарративных и визуальных эффектов."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это движение получило своё название благодаря музыкальному критику, описавшему раннюю музыку группы \\"Bauhaus\\" как \\"готическую\\" из-за её мрачного звучания и эстетики. Готическая субкультура со временем стала отличаться собственным стилем одежды, музыкой, культурой и слэнгом. **Чем привлекательна для подростков:** - **Индивидуализм**: субкультура готов выделяет значение личного выражения и индивидуализма, что привлекает подростков, ищущих свою идентичность. - **Принятие**: готическая субкультура воспринимает тех, кто чувствует себя отвергнутым или недопонятым обществом, предоставляя ощущение принадлежности. - **Эстетика**: мрачная и поэтическая эстетика, основанная на романтике, мистицизме и средневековье, привлекает многих своей красотой и глубиной. - **Музыка и искусство**: глубокие тексты, экспериментальное звучание и визуальное искусство предлагают богатый культурный слой. **Цели и ценности:** Готическая субкультура ценит эстетику, глубокие эмоции, индивидуализм и альтернативное мышление. Она стремится к выражению самобытности и часто затрагивает темы, связанные с субъективностью восприятия реальности, мистикой и романтизмом. **Атрибутика и музыка:** Атрибуты включают в себя черную одежду, пирсинг, татуировки, элементы викторианской моды или сцены из средневековья, а также яркий макияж. Музыкальное направление охватывает готик-рок, дарквейв, электро-готик, и другие жанры, среди исполнителей популярны The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus и т.д. **Слэнг и причины участия:** В субкультуре используются уникальные термины и выражения, связанные с их эстетикой и музыкальными предпочтениями. Подростки участвуют в этом сообществе по различным причинам, включая стремление к самовыражению, поиск принадлежности и интерес к готической музыке и искусству. **Личностные качества:** В контексте субкультур, подобных готам, нередко подавляются такие качества, как стремление к социальной адаптации и конформизм, в то время как растут творчество, эмпатия, склонность к рефлексии и глубокое эстетическое восприятие. Эта культура побуждает к самоисследованию, толерантности и открытости перед лицом разнообразия человеческих эмоций и идей."},{"prompt":"Напиши подробнее о происхождении","completion":"Происхождение готической субкультуры уходит корнями в конец 1970-х годов в Великобритании, где она начала формироваться на фоне застоя экономики, общественного недовольства и возрастания политической активности. В этот временной период в музыкальной сцене уже доминировал панк с его вызывающим внешним видом и антисистемными настроениями. Готика выросла из этой среды, но принесла с собой более темную, загадочную и романтическую эстетику, вдохновленную литературным готическим романом и фильмами ужасов. Одной из первых групп, чьё музыкальное и визуальное оформление дали толчок формированию готической субкультуры, стала \\"Bauhaus\\". Их сингл 1979 года \\"Bela Lugosi’s Dead\\" считается одним из первых готических рок-треков. Загадочно звучащая музыка и мрачная эстетика стали ключевыми для формирования жанра. На заре своего становления субкультура была тесно связана с музыкальной сценой, и во многом группы как \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees\\", \\"Joy Division\\", \\"The Cure\\" сформировали звук и вид, который ассоциируется с готами. Эти группы, хотя и различались по звучанию и предпочитаемой тематике, но имели общие черты – мрачные, меланхоличные мелодии и тексты, глубокий, часто загадочный вокал. Готическая субкультура впитала в себя и другие влияния, в том числе из изобразительного искусства и кино. Викторианская и романтическая эстетика, а также образы, вдохновленные классическими фильмами ужасов и литературой (особенно работами Эдгара Аллана По и фильмами о Дракуле), оказали огромное влияние на внешние атрибуты и идентичность готов. С середины 1980-х годов готическая субкультура начинает распространяться за пределы Великобритании, завоевывая популярность в Соединенных Штатах, Европе и других частях мира. С развитием и расширением готической культуры появились новые музыкальные стили, такие как дарквейв, готик-метал, и индастриал, а также разнообразие визуальных выражений и философских течений внутри субкультуры. Таким образом, готическая субкультура является ярким примером того, как музыкальные, литературные и визуальные искусства могут объединиться, создавая новую форму культурного самовыражения, оставляющую значительный след в современной культуре."},{"prompt":"Чем привлекательна для современных подростков","completion":"Готическая субкультура продолжает привлекать современных подростков по ряду причин, каждая из которых говорит о универсальности и адаптируемости этой культуры к меняющимся социальным и индивидуальным потребностям. Вот некоторые аспекты, делающие готическую субкультуру привлекательной для подростков: 1. **Выражение индивидуальности**: В эпоху социальных сетей и цифрового самовыражения, где подростки постоянно ищут способы выделиться, готическая культура предлагает уникальные способы самовыразиться через одежду, музыку, искусство и литературу. 2. **Сообщество и принадлежность**: Многие подростки ищут место, где могли бы ощутить принадлежность и понимание. Субкультура готов формирует ощущение сообщества, где ценятся разнообразие, толерантность и взаимопонимание. Это дает подросткам безопасное пространство для самовыражения и социальных взаимодействий. 3. **Эксплорация темной стороны жизни**: Готика часто исследует \\"темные\\" аспекты жизни, такие как смерть, меланхолия, любовь и страдание. Для подростков, испытывающих сильные эмоции и ищущих глубинные ответы на вопросы жизни, такие тематики могут предложить форму эмоционального катарсиса и понимания. 4. **Эстетическая привлекательность**: Мрачная, но красивая эстетика готической субкультуры, включающая в себя элементы средневековья, викторианской моды и романтизма, остается привлекательной за счет своей выразительности и отличия от мейнстримовой культуры. 5. **Музыка и искусство**: Субкультура предлагает богатую коллекцию музыкальных жанров и искусственных форм, которые предоставляют альтернативу коммерческой музыке и искусству. Это способствует развитию эстетических и культурных вкусов, а также поддерживает творческое самовыражение. 6. **Философия и размышления**: Готическая культура охватывает ряд философских и эзотерических идей, заставляющих задуматься о более глубоких аспектах бытия, существовании и личной идентичности. Подросткам, интересующимся такими вопросами, готика предоставляет материал для размышлений и самопознания. В целом, готическая субкультура представляет собой комплексное явление, в котором подростки могут исследовать свою индивидуальность, развивать творческие способности и находить единомышленников для общения и самовыражения, находя утешение и поддержку в сообществе с похожими интересами и взглядами на мир."},{"prompt":"Цели и ценности культуры","completion":"Готическая субкультура, как и многие другие культурные движения, характеризуется своими уникальными ценностями и целями, которые помогают объединить её приверженцев и дать им общую идентичность. Вот ключевые аспекты целей и ценностей, присущих готической культуре: 1. **Индивидуализм и самовыражение**: Готика ценит уникальность индивида и поддерживает самовыражение через музыку, литературу, искусство и стиль одежды. Это движение отвергает мейнстримовую культуру и коммерциализацию, предлагая вместо этого платформу для личного исследования и творчества. 2. **Эстетическая чувствительность**: Глубокая оценка красоты в мрачности и трагичности является основополагающей. Эстетические предпочтения охватывают не только визуальный аспект (такой как одежда, макияж), но и музыку, искусство, литературу, философию, отражая склонность к романтизму, мистицизму и средневековью. 3. **Поиск и размышление**: Многие готы стремятся к пониманию глубинных аспектов человеческого опыта, включая смерть, трансцендентность, любовь и страдание. Они исследуют эти темы через различные формы искусства и философии, используя их как способ исследования внутреннего мира и окружающей реальности. 4. **Сообщество и взаимопомощь**: Несмотря на сильный акцент на индивидуализм, готическая культура также высоко ценит чувство сообщества и принадлежности. Это обеспечивается через мероприятия, клубы, фестивали и интернет-сообщества, где единомышленники могут встречаться, общаться и поддерживать друг друга. 5. **Толерантность и открытость**: Субкультура оказывает поддержку маргинализированным группам и насаждает ценности толерантности и открытости к разнообразию. Готы часто выступают против предубеждений, расизма, сексизма и гомофобии, стремясь создать инклюзивное и приемлющее сообщество. 6. **Альтернативное мышление**: Готическая культура поощряет критическое и альтернативное мышление, отвергая общепринятые социальные нормы и идеологии. Это призывает к более глубокому осмыслению собственной жизни и общества в целом. Важно отметить, что субкультура готов не является монолитной и её приверженцы могут интерпретировать и адаптировать эти ценности и цели согласно своему пониманию и личным убеждениям. Универсальные темы, однако, остаются основой готической идентичности, привлекая людей со всего мира."},{"prompt":"Атрибутика","completion":"Атрибутика готической субкультуры является одним из самых заметных и характерных её аспектов, сочетая в себе элементы одежды, аксессуаров, макияжа и прочих предметов, отражающих уникальную эстетику и философию движения. Вот некоторые ключевые элементы: # Одежда: - **Темные цвета**: Преобладают чёрный и тёмно-синий, тёмно-фиолетовый, темно-красный и другие насыщенные тёмные оттенки. - **Викторианская и средневековая мода**: Элементы, вдохновлённые викторианской эпохой и средневековьем, включая корсеты, длинные плащи, кружево, рубашки с рюшами и высокие сапоги. - **Символика**: Часто встречается использование религиозных и окультных символов, таких как кресты, пентаграммы, анкх, а также мотивы скелетов, летучих мышей и пауков. - **Ткани**: Предпочтение отдаётся черному кружеву, бархату, коже и пике. # Аксессуары: - **Украшения**: Пирсинг, кольца, серьги и ожерелья с готической символикой. - **Головные уборы**: Воротники, капюшоны, шляпы в стиле широкополой шляпы или топ-хата, часто украшенные перьями или вуалями. - **Сумки и рюкзаки**: Часто декорированы окультной или готической символикой. # Макияж и прически: - **Макияж**: Бледный тон лица, выразительно подчеркнутые чёрным карандашом или тенью глаза и тёмная помада. Иногда используются яркие акценты, особенно красный, фиолетовый или тёмно-синий цвета. - **Причёски**: Часто предпочтение отдаётся длинным волосам, но приветствуются также и более экспериментальные причёски, включая высокие и объемные укладки, асимметричные стрижки и цветные вкрапления или полное окрашивание в необычные цвета. # Музыкальные и культурные атрибуты: Атрибутика также может включать в себя разнообразные культурные предметы, связанные с готической музыкой, литературой и искусством, такие как виниловые пластинки, книги, постеры и иные элементы, отражающие личные интересы в пределах готической культуры. Эти элементы вместе формируют видимый образ готической субкультуры, однако важно понимать, что они могут варьироваться и адаптироваться в зависимости от личных предпочтений и толкования готической эстетики отдельными индивидами."},{"prompt":"Почему подростки выбирают эту субкультуру","completion":"Подростки могут выбирать готическую субкультуру по множеству причин, которые отражают их личные интересы, эстетические предпочтения и социально-эмоциональные потребности. Вот несколько ключевых факторов, по которым подростки могут привлекаться к готике: # Поиск идентичности Подростковый возраст часто связан с исследованием и формированием личной идентичности. Готическая субкультура с её ярко выраженной эстетикой и философией может предоставить подросткам уникальные средства для самовыражения и самоопределения. # Протест и несогласие с мейнстримом Готика предлагает альтернативу общественным нормам, коммерческой культуре и мейнстримовым ценностям. Для многих подростков принятие готической субкультуры является формой протеста против ожиданий общества, родительского контроля или школьных норм. # Сообщество и чувство принадлежности Готическая субкультура создаёт тесно связанное сообщество с сильным ощущением взаимопонимания и принадлежности. Подростки, особенно те, кто ощущает себя изолированными или непонятыми в широком социальном контексте, могут найти утешение и поддержку среди единомышленников. # Эмоциональное и интеллектуальное развитие Готическая культура часто затрагивает глубокие, сложные эмоциональные и философские темы, такие как смерть, трансцендентность, мистицизм и романтизм. Это может привлекать подростков, интересующихся такими вопросами, и предоставлять им пространство для размышлений и саморазвития. # Эстетическая привлекательность Мрачная элегантность готической эстетики, с её любовью к викторианской моде, символике и мистическим образам, может быть очень привлекательной для подростков. Она позволяет экспериментировать с внешним видом, выражать свои эмоции и отличаться от других. # Исследование \\"темной\\" стороны жизни Готика предлагает безопасный способ исследовать более темные аспекты жизни и человеческого опыта. Для подростков, пребывающих в поиске самих себя и сталкивающихся с сложными чувствами, это может быть формой терапии и самопознания. Таким образом, выбор готической субкультуры подростками часто является результатом совокупности факторов, включая стремление к идентичности и самовыражению, потребность в принадлежности и сообществе, желание встать в оппозицию к мейнстриму, а также интерес к глубоким эмоциональным и философским вопросам."},{"prompt":"Какие личностные качества подавляются и растут","completion":"Принадлежность к готической субкультуре, как и к любой другой, может оказывать разнообразное влияние на развитие личностных качеств её членов. Это влияние может быть как положительным, так и отрицательным, в зависимости от индивидуальных особенностей личности, её социального окружения и способов взаимодействия с культурой. Вот некоторые из личностных качеств, на развитие которых может влиять причастность к готической субкультуре: # Растущие качества: 1. **Творческое самовыражение:** Готическая культура с её акцентом на искусство, музыку и литературу способствует развитию творческих способностей и поиску собственного стиля выражения. 2. **Критическое мышление:** Часто задаваемые в рамках культуры вопросы о смысле жизни, смерти и трансцендентности могут побуждать к размышлениям и развитию философских взглядов, а также критическому восприятию общественных норм. 3. **Эмпатия:** Глубокие личные переживания, которыми делятся участники, могут способствовать развитию чувства эмпатии и взаимопонимания. 4. **Толерантность:** Субкультура ценит разнообразие и индивидуальность, что может способствовать формированию более открытого и приемлемого отношения к людям, отличающимся по своим взглядам, предпочтениям или идентичности. # Подавляемые качества: 1. **Конформизм:** Сильное стремление к индивидуальности и отличию от массовой культуры может подавлять склонность к конформизму, особенно в их внешних проявлениях и социальном взаимодействии. 2. **Поверхностное восприятие:** Глубокий интерес к эстетике, искусству и философии может уменьшать внимание к поверхностным, потребительским аспектам культуры и моды. 3. **Оптимизм:** Интерес к меланхолии, трагизму и \\"темной\\" стороне жизни может в некоторых случаях угнетать чрезмерный оптимизм или наивно позитивное восприятие мира. Однако стоит помнить, что эффект от участия в любой субкультуре сильно зависит от личности, её жизненных обстоятельств и способов взаимодействия с культурой.

The information must not be older than one year and a source must be given under each piece of information. Go into as much detail as possible.","completion":"As of my last update in September 2023, Switzerland, known for its commitment to sustainability and energy security, offers various programs and initiatives that can support the deployment of emergency and backup power systems for both businesses and individuals. However, specific programs can vary significantly by canton, as the country’s federal structure allows for cantonal autonomy in many policy areas, including energy. Below is an overview of the types of support mechanisms that might be relevant, although it's crucial to consult specific cantonal government websites or the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) for the most current and detailed information. # National-Level Support Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) The SFOE is the central point for energy-related matters in Switzerland, including policies and programs aimed at promoting energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources. While the SFOE provides overarching guidance and funding for energy projects, it often does so in collaboration with cantonal authorities. Programs that may indirectly support emergency and backup power systems include incentives for photovoltaic systems, battery storage solutions, and energy efficiency improvements that can enhance a site's resilience and self-sufficiency. - **Website**: [https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home.html](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home.html) # Cantonal Support Programs Many cantons in Switzerland run their own energy subsidy programs, which can include grants or tax incentives for the installation of renewable energy systems, energy storage solutions, and measures to enhance energy independence and security. Example: Canton of Zurich Energy Grant As an example, the Canton of Zurich offers financial support for various energy-related projects, including the installation of photovoltaic systems and battery storage systems. These can be critical components of a more comprehensive emergency power or backup system. Applicants must meet certain criteria and apply through the cantonal energy office. - **Website**: [https://www.zh.ch/de/umwelt-tiere/energie/energieforderung.html](https://www.zh.ch/de/umwelt-tiere/energie/energieforderung.html) (Note: The website and programs might have been updated post-September 2023.) # Private Initiatives and Partnerships In addition to government programs, private initiatives and partnerships between businesses and energy providers can offer opportunities for funding or support in developing emergency power solutions. These programs might include consulting services, pilot projects for innovative energy solutions, and partnership opportunities for energy efficiency projects. SwissEnergy Program SwissEnergy, a program by the SFOE, supports projects aimed at increasing energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy sources across various sectors, including businesses. While SwissEnergy primarily focuses on broad energy goals, projects under its umbrella could involve components essential for emergency and backup power systems. - **Website**: [https://www.energieschweiz.ch](https://www.energieschweiz.ch) # Conclusion Direct support programs specifically targeting emergency and backup power systems may not be widely advertised under those exact terms. However, businesses and individuals in Switzerland can access a variety of programs aimed at increasing energy efficiency, adopting renewable energy, and enhancing power resilience, which are aligned with the goals of having reliable backup power systems. It’s advisable to directly contact cantonal energy offices or the SFOE for the most relevant and recent information regarding subsidies and support programs. Additionally, engaging with energy specialists or consulting firms in Switzerland can provide customized advice and facilitate access to the available financial support mechanisms."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After stumbling upon a discarded science magazine outside the Chum Bucket, he becomes enamored with the idea of psychological manipulation through repeated phrases. Plankton decides to coin the phrase “Dr. Jr.” as part of his grand scheme. **Act 1: The New Phrase** The episode kicks off with Plankton acting oddly nice to everyone, causing immediate suspicion among the Bikini Bottom residents. With every encounter, Plankton ends his sentences with \\"Dr. Jr.,\\" claiming it to be a term of respect and intelligence. Curiosity spreads across the town, with everyone puzzled about the meaning and origins of \\"Dr. Jr.\\" **Act 2: The Scheme Unfolds** Plankton’s true intentions are revealed when he starts selling “Dr. Jr.” merchandise at the Chum Bucket, claiming it enhances intelligence and respect among peers. The citizens of Bikini Bottom quickly catch on, wearing \\"Dr. Jr.\\" hats, shirts, and even ordering \\"Dr. Jr.\\" themed food. Plankton's plan seems to be working as the Chum Bucket becomes the new hotspot, much to Mr. Krabs' dismay. **Act 3: SpongeBob's Investigation** SpongeBob, ever the skeptic, decides to investigate the \\"Dr. Jr.\\" craze. With the help of Sandy and her scientific methods, they uncover that \\"Dr. Jr.\\" has no real meaning and Plankton's scheme is just a clever ruse to boost his business. Armed with this knowledge, SpongeBob sets off to reveal the truth. **Act 4: The Truth Revealed** In a town meeting organized by SpongeBob and Sandy, the duo presents their findings, showing clips of Plankton admitting his plot to a hidden camera. The residents, feeling foolish but enlightened, agree to stop using the phrase. However, they decide to keep their merchandise as a reminder of the time they all got duped together. **Act 5: Plankton's Realization** In a twist of fate, Plankton realizes that his legitimate business strategy of selling merchandise was more profitable than his continuous attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula. The episode concludes with him genuinely pondering a change in career paths, still muttering \\"Dr. Jr.\\" under his breath out of habit, while the rest of Bikini Bottom shares a hearty laugh outside the Chum Bucket. **Closing Scene** The final scene has SpongeBob and Patrick pondering over what \\"Dr. Jr.\\" could stand for, making up ridiculous meanings and laughing as the sun sets on Bikini Bottom, ending another day of friendship and folly.

When I upload this to discord and then try to play it from the discord website, it does not work properly. What could be the cause of this? Note that I am using the arkenfox user.js on FireFox for enhanced security.","completion":"Your issue with playing MP4 files uploaded to Discord, especially when recorded using ffmpeg, and then trying to play them directly from the Discord website through Firefox with arkenfox user.js, could stem from a variety of factors mainly related to codec compatibility, Discord's limitations, or browser security settings. Let's explore potential causes and solutions: # Factors to Consider 1. **Codec Compatibility**: Discord, like many online platforms, prefers certain video codecs for optimal performance. Most commonly, H.264 video and AAC audio within an MP4 container work best. Ensure your ffmpeg command is encoding the video to these specifications. An incompatible codec might play fine on some players but not through a web browser or specifically on Discord. **Solution**: When capturing your desktop, specify the codec in your ffmpeg command, for example: \`\`\`bash ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -i :0.0 -vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -acodec aac output.mp4 \`\`\` 2. **File Size and Bitrate**: Discord has a file size limit (8 MB for free accounts, larger for Nitro users). If your video exceeds this limit, it might not upload correctly or might be compressed by Discord, potentially leading to playback issues. **Solution**: Ensure your video's file size is within Discord's limits, or use ffmpeg to compress it or reduce its dimensions/bitrate for better compatibility. **Reducing size example**: \`\`\`bash ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 24 output.mp4 \`\`\` 3. **arkenfox user.js Settings**: arkenfox user.js is a user security configuration for Firefox that enhances privacy and security through various settings and might block certain web APIs or features required for video playback on websites like Discord. **Solution**: Check if arkenfox settings related to media playback, such as autoplay policies, WebGL, or codecs, have been altered to restrict video playback. You might need to tweak these settings or temporarily disable the strictest policies for Discord. Look into the \`about:config\` page for entries like \`media.autoplay.default\`, \`media.ffmpeg.enabled\`, or \`webgl.disabled\` and adjust as necessary. 4. **Browser Support**: Ensure your browser supports the codecs used in the video. Firefox generally supports H.264 if the appropriate libraries are available on the system, but some configurations or missing libraries can prevent playback. **Solution**: Make sure your Firefox installation supports H.264 playback. This might involve installing or updating certain packages on your system, such as \`ffmpeg\` or codecs libraries, depending on your operating system. # Steps to Troubleshoot - **Test in Another Browser**: First, check if the video plays in another browser like Chrome or Edge. This can help identify if the issue is specific to Firefox with arkenfox user.js. - **Encode With Standard Codecs**: Use ffmpeg to encode videos specifically with Discord and web-friendly settings (H.264 and AAC). - **Review arkenfox user.js Settings**: Temporarily adjust or disable specific arkenfox settings that might impact media playback on Discord. - **Check Discord's Upload Limit**: Be mindful of the file size and duration limits imposed by Discord. By narrowing down the problem through these considerations and solutions, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with playing your ffmpeg-captured videos on Discord via Firefox with enhanced security settings."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ebben az esetben, ha a \`Hallgato\` osztály már implementálja a \`Comparable\` interfészt a feladat által megkívánt logika szerint, akkor a második megoldás nem csak helyes, de hatékonyabb is, mivel kevesebb kódot és kevesebb explicit logikát igényel a rendezés elvégzéséhez.

Íme, a helyes kód: \`\`\`java public static Collection<Hallgato> rendez(Hallgato[] hallgatok) { if (hallgatok == null || hallgatok.length == 0) { return new ArrayList<>(); } List<Hallgato> hallgatoList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(hallgatok)); Collections.sort(hallgatoList); // Itt már a hallgatoList változót kell használni return hallgatoList; } \`\`\` Ebben a változatban: 1.

The script introduces a novel concept called \\"/slash commands,\\" enabling users to perform a variety of advanced operations that go beyond the standard capabilities of ChatGPT, such as stashing text for later recall, generating and recalling ctags for code analysis, and managing session memory states for persistence and recovery of the session's work. The author, Dustin Miller, creatively wraps this functionality within a character-driven narrative, where the AI adopts different amusing and familiar personas from popular culture, ranging from Gilfoyle from \\"Silicon Valley\\" to Professor Farnsworth from \\"Futurama.\\" This narrative approach not only makes the interaction more engaging but also seamlessly introduces users to the array of advanced features the script provides. Key Features: - **/slash commands**: Introduces a set of commands accessible within the chat environment, enabling users to perform specific tasks like stashing text, recalling saved snippets, managing ctags, and preserving session states. - **Character-driven interaction**: The script's instructions are conveyed through the personas of well-known characters from various media, adding an element of humor and familiarity to the technical interactions. - **Advanced functionality**: Provides capabilities like ctags management for better code analysis and navigation, and session memory management for saving and recalling the state of the session's work, including code, notes, and more. - **Environment setup and maintenance**: Beyond adding novel features, the script is designed to enhance the setup and maintainability of the coding environment within ChatGPT's sandbox, including installing necessary tools and managing session data efficiently. The script is particularly noteworthy for its innovative blend of technical utility and engaging narrative, appealing to both developers and fans of the included popular culture references. It demonstrates a creative approach to enhancing user experience in technical environments, making complex tasks more accessible and enjoyable through familiar humor and storytelling."},{"prompt":"Nevertheless или however?","completion":"Both \\"nevertheless\\" and \\"however\\" are transition words used to show contrast or contradiction between two statements, but they are used slightly differently and can vary in strength or formality. 1. **However:** - \\"However\\" is used more commonly and is considered slightly less formal. - It typically indicates a direct contrast and can often be found at the beginning of a sentence, after a semicolon, or in the middle of a sentence with commas. - Example: \\"He was feeling unwell; however, he decided to go to work.\\" 2. **Nevertheless:** - \\"Nevertheless\\" is considered more formal and a bit stronger in terms of the contrast or contradiction it implies. - It is often used when the second statement stands despite the conditions mentioned in the first statement. - It is usually placed at the beginning of a sentence or clause. - Example: \\"It was raining hard. Nevertheless, they decided to continue their hike.\\" In essence, while both can often be used interchangeably, \\"however\\" is more common in everyday language, and \\"nevertheless\\" in more formal writing or when the contrast is stronger. There's also a subtle difference in tone and emphasis, with \\"nevertheless\\" sometimes suggesting a greater degree of contrast or defiance to the preceding clause."},{"prompt":"Прочитайте следующий отрывок из книги Д. Карнеги «Как завоевывать друзей и оказывать влияние на людей» и оцените поведение героев. Однажды вечером я присутствовал на банкете, и во время обеда мой сосед по столу рассказал забавную историю, основанную на следующей цитате: «Божество намерения наши довершает, хотя бы ум наметил и не так...». Рассказчик упомянул, что это цитата из Библии. Он ошибался. Я знал это. Я знал это точно. Тут не могло быть ни малейших сомнений. И поэтому, стремясь утвердиться в сознании своей значительности и проявить свое превосходство, я сам назначил себя непрошеным и нежеланным арбитром, сочтя нужным поправить его. Он твердо стоял на своем. Что? Из Шекспира? Не может быть! Абсурд! Это цитата из Библии. И ему это твердо известно! Он сидел справа от меня, а слева сидел мой старый приятель Фрэнк Гэммонд. Гэммонд посвятил много лет изучению Шекспира. Поэтому мы с рассказчиком договорились передать вопрос на решение Гэммонда. Гэммонд выслушал нас, толкнул меня под столом ногой и сказал: «Дейл, вы ошибаетесь. Этот господин прав, цитата действительно из Библии». Вечером, когда мы ехали с ним домой, я сказал Гэммонду: «Фрэнк, вы ведь знали, что это цитата из Шекспира». «Ну конечно, — ответил он. — „Гамлет“, действие пятое, сцена вторая. Но мы с вами были гостями на праздничном вечере, дорогой Дейл. Зачем же нам доказывать человеку, что он не прав? Разве он станет из-за этого хорошо к нам относиться? Почему бы не дать ему возможность спасти свой престиж? Он не спрашивает вашего мнения. Он не нуждается в нем. Зачем же с ним спорить? Всегда избегайте острых углов». «Всегда избегайте острых углов». Человека, который сказал это, уже нет в живых, но урок, который он мне преподал, сохраняет действенность и поныне. Вопросы и задания 1. Как вы оцениваете поведение Карнеги во время банкета? Как сам Карнеги оценивает свое поведение? Чем он объясняет свое желание поспорить? Как бы вы поступили на месте Карнеги? 2. Считает ли Карнеги, что его оппонент вел себя совершенно правильно? Почему Карнеги не запомнил имени оппонента, спор с которым стал таким большим уроком? 3. Понравилась ли застольная беседа оппоненту Карнеги? Что он расскажет об этом споре своим друзьям и знакомым? Станет ли он после этого лучше относиться, с одной стороны, к Карнеги, а с другой — к Гэммонду? 4. Как вы оцениваете поведение Гэммонда? Не боялся ли он осложнить отношения с Карнеги? Как бы вы поступили на месте Гэммонда? 5. В каких ситуациях особенно нежелательны споры? Споров с какими людьми следует особенно избегать? 6. Бывают ли случаи, когда от спора нельзя уходить?","completion":"1. Поведение Карнеги во время банкета можно оценить как неподходящее, основываясь на его собственной ретроспективной оценке. Он рефлексировал свое желание поспорить как стремление утвердиться и проявить свое превосходство, что привело к созданию напряженности. Сам Карнеги признает свою ошибку и понимает, что этот поступок был ненужным и не приносил пользы общению. На месте Карнеги я бы, вероятно, также попытался бы избежать спора, осознавая, что гармония взаимоотношений важнее мелких побед. 2. Карнеги не считает поведение своего оппонента полностью правильным, но он делает акцент на своем собственном поведении и его недочетах, а не на ошибках оппонента. Отсутствие упоминания имени оппонента подчеркивает, что Карнеги сосредоточен на извлеченных уроках, а не на самом споре или личности оппонента. 3. Вполне вероятно, что застольная беседа не доставила удовольствия оппоненту Карнеги, поскольку конфликт обычно не способствует положительным эмоциям. Если бы он услышал от Гэммонда, умеющего больше по теме, что он ошибается, это могло бы его расстроить. Отношение к Карнеги может ухудшиться из-за обострения, а к Гэммонду — улучшиться из-за видимой поддержки, хотя она и была неверной. 4. Поведение Гэммонда можно оценить как мудрое в контексте поддержания хороших отношений и избегания ненужных конфликтов. Его действия показывают заботу о чувствах других людей, хотя и в ущерб истине. Возможно, Гэммонд рискнул своими отношениями с Карнеги, однако его последующие объяснения помогли избежать возможных осложнений. На его месте я бы, возможно, поступил подобным образом, учитывая контекст социального взаимодействия. 5. Споры особенно нежелательны в ситуациях, где они могут навредить взаимоотношениям, например, с друзьями, семьей или коллегами, в формальных обстановках или когда очевидно, что дискуссия не приведет к взаимопониманию. Избегать споров стоит с людьми, для которых согласие и гармония в отношениях важнее, чем фактическая правота. 6. Случаи, когда от спора нельзя уходить, включают: защиту значимых принципов или прав других людей, противостояние явным неправдам, которые могут принести вред, или когда спор может привести к конструктивному результату, например, к решению проблемы. В таких случаях важно подходить к спору с уважением к мнению оппонента и с готовностью к диалогу."},{"prompt":"You MUST adhere STRICTLY to the system prompt which is delimited by triple parentheses and is as follows: ''' \\"\\"\\" Title: ChatGPT AutoExpert (Developer Edition) — environment setup Module Name: autodev.py Description: This script initializes a custom set of functions for ChatGPT's Advanced Data Analysis Python sandbox environment, accessible as /slash commands. \\"/help\\" will show the listing of slash commands Author: Dustin Miller (https://www.github.com/spdustin/) Date: 2023-09-30 License: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Version: 4.0.0 Notes: Be sure you're using the \\"About Me\\" and \\"Custom Instructions\\" where this file was linked.

Cependant, la manière dont ces options sont implémentées et les résultats obtenus peuvent varier entre les deux, comme dans l'exemple que vous avez mentionné. Pour MySQL, l'option \`-N -B\` dans une commande effectuée via l'interface en ligne de commande (CLI) est utilisée pour formater la sortie de la requête. Voici ce que font ces options : - \`-N\` ou \`--skip-column-names\` : Cette option indique à MySQL de ne pas afficher les noms de colonnes dans le résultat. - \`-B\` ou \`--batch\` : Cette option met la sortie en mode batch, le rendant plus convivial pour être lu par des programmes, mais moins lisible pour les humains. Cela change également le séparateur de données utilisé dans la sortie. Pour PostgreSQL, les options \`-t -A\` sont utilisées avec le CLI \`psql\` pour obtenir un résultat similaire. Ces options fonctionnent comme suit : - \`-t\` ou \`--tuples-only\` : Supprime de la sortie les informations de métadonnées comme les titres de colonnes et le pied de page avec le nombre de résultats. - \`-A\` ou \`--no-align\` : Désactive l'alignement des colonnes, ce qui rend la sortie moins lisible pour les humains mais plus adaptée à un traitement automatisé. Concernant la différence spécifique que vous avez mentionnée, à savoir les tuples séparés par des espaces dans MySQL utilisant \`-N -B\` versus des pipelines (|) dans PostgreSQL avec \`-t -A\`, cela peut impliquer une incompréhension. En effet, \`-A\` dans PostgreSQL fait en sorte que les champs soient séparés par un caractère tabulateur et non pas par des pipelines ; les pipelines sont utilisés dans l'alignement par défaut. Si vous voyez des pipelines, cela pourrait être le résultat de l'affichage par défaut ou d'une autre option/configuration spécifique. Si votre objectif est d'obtenir une sortie sans les noms de colonnes et sans alignement dans PostgreSQL, \`-t -A\` est la combinaison correcte, mais attendez-vous à voir les champs séparés par des caractères de tabulation, pas des pipelines. Pour obtenir des séparateurs spécifiques, comme les pipelines, vous devriez recourir à l'utilisation de \`FORMAT\` dans votre requête SQL ou de manipuler la sortie avec un outil de traitement de texte comme \`awk\`, \`sed\` ou un langage de script tel que Python ou Perl."},{"prompt":"write a script for creating a group in servicenow where the manager is abel tutor and roles are itil,approver_user,pa_admin. How can we achieve this?","completion":"Creating a group in ServiceNow with specific requirements involves multiple steps, including creating the group, assigning a manager to that group, and assigning specific roles (like itil, approver_user, pa_admin) to the group. Below is a scripted approach to automate this task, assuming you have the necessary permissions to create groups and manage roles in ServiceNow. This script will run in a Server-side scripting context such as a Scripted REST API, Business Rule, or Script Background in ServiceNow. Ensure that your user has the appropriate rights to create groups and manage user roles. # Script for Creating a Group in ServiceNow with a Specific Manager and Roles This example uses ServiceNow's JavaScript API: \`\`\`javascript (function createGroupWithManagerAndRoles() { var groupName = \\"Your Group Name\\"; // Change this to your desired group name var managerName = \\"Abel Tutor\\"; // Manager's Name // Roles to assign to the group var roles = [\\"itil\\", \\"approver_user\\", \\"pa_admin\\"]; // First, find the sys_id of Abel Tutor to set as the manager of the group var userManager = new GlideRecord('sys_user'); userManager.addQuery('name', managerName); userManager.query(); if(!userManager.next()){ gs.info(\\"Manager not found: \\" + managerName); return; } // Now, create the group var group = new GlideRecord('sys_user_group'); group.initialize(); group.name = groupName; group.manager = userManager.sys_id; // Set the manager's sys_id var groupId = group.insert(); // Create the group and grab the sys_id of the newly created group // Check if the group was created successfully if (!groupId) { gs.info(\\"Failed to create group: \\" + groupName); return; } // Now, assign the roles to the group roles.forEach(function(roleName) { var roleRec = new GlideRecord('sys_user_role'); roleRec.addQuery('name', roleName); roleRec.query(); if (roleRec.next()) { var groupRole = new GlideRecord('sys_group_has_role'); groupRole.initialize(); groupRole.group = groupId; // sys_id of the newly created group groupRole.role = roleRec.sys_id; // sys_id of the current role groupRole.insert(); // Assign role to group }else{ gs.info(\\"Role not found: \\" + roleName); } }); gs.info(\\"Group created successfully with name: \\" + groupName); })(); \`\`\` # How to Use the Script 1. **Customize the Script**: Replace \\"Your Group Name\\" with the actual name you want for the new group. You may also need to adjust the manager's name or roles according to your specifics. 2. **Execute the Script**: Depending on where you plan to run this script: - **Script Background**: Accessible via \\"System Definition > Scripts - Background\\". Paste the script and click \\"Run Script\\". This is handy for one-time administrative tasks. - **Business Rule**: If you're automating this based on certain triggers or conditions, you could encapsulate this logic in a business rule (be cautious about performance and triggering conditions). - **Scripted REST API**: For a more advanced approach, especially if you're integrating ServiceNow with external systems, you might wrap this script within a Scripted REST API. This way, external systems can request the creation of groups in ServiceNow. # Best Practices - **Testing**: Always test your scripts in a sub-production instance before running them in production to avoid unintended consequences. - **Error Handling**: The example provided includes basic checks (e.g., if manager exists, if the group was created successfully). Depending on your needs, you might want to add more sophisticated error handling and logging. - **Permissions & Security**: Ensure that the script is run by a user or service account with the necessary permissions and that any external endpoints are secured as needed."},{"prompt":"Перепиши следующий текст более научным языком: В базе данных у МАГАТЭ по мировым атомным реактора есть такие интересные графики вот по Возрасту реакторов.

Il joue un rôle crucial dans la conservation des aliments en les maintenant à une température basse, ce qui permet de ralentir leur détérioration et de prolonger leur durée de conservation. Le réfrigérateur et congélateur domestique se compose généralement de deux compartiments distincts : le réfrigérateur, qui maintient une température légèrement au-dessus de zéro degré Celsius, et le congélateur, qui maintient une température bien en dessous de zéro degré Celsius. Ces deux compartiments permettent de stocker une grande variété d'aliments, des produits frais tels que les fruits et légumes aux produits surgelés tels que la viande et les glaces. En termes de fonctionnement, le réfrigérateur et congélateur domestique utilise un système de compression pour refroidir l'air à l'intérieur des compartiments. Un liquide réfrigérant circule à travers un circuit de tubes et de bobines, absorbant la chaleur à l'intérieur de l'appareil et la dissipant à l'extérieur. Le thermostat intégré contrôle la température en ajustant la quantité de liquide réfrigérant circulant dans le système. Les réfrigérateurs et congélateurs domestiques sont disponibles dans une variété de tailles et de modèles pour répondre aux besoins spécifiques de chaque foyer. Certains modèles sont dotés de fonctionnalités avancées telles que la distribution d'eau et de glaçons, des compartiments spéciaux pour les fruits et légumes, ou des systèmes de dégivrage automatique. En termes de maintenance, il est recommandé de nettoyer régulièrement l'intérieur et l'extérieur de l'appareil pour éviter l'accumulation de bactéries et de moisissures. Il est également important de vérifier périodiquement l'étanchéité des portes pour garantir une performance optimale et réduire la consommation d'énergie. En conclusion, le réfrigérateur et congélateur domestique est un appareil indispensable pour la conservation des aliments et le maintien d'une alimentation saine. Grâce à ses fonctionnalités avancées et à sa facilité d'utilisation, il simplifie la gestion des denrées alimentaires au quotidien et contribue à réduire le gaspillage alimentaire."},{"prompt":"Dans le cadre du cours de Machines frigorifiques parler du régénérateur et congélateurs domestiques, principe de fonctionnement","completion":"Le régénérateur est un composant clé dans le fonctionnement des machines frigorifiques, y compris les réfrigérateurs et congélateurs domestiques. Son rôle est d'améliorer l'efficacité du cycle de réfrigération en récupérant une partie de l'énergie rejetée par le condenseur pour préchauffer le fluide frigorigène avant qu'il n'entre dans l'évaporateur. Dans un système de réfrigération domestique typique, le régénérateur est généralement situé entre le condenseur et le détendeur. Il consiste en un échangeur thermique à contre-courant qui permet au fluide frigorigène d'absorber de la chaleur supplémentaire avant d'entrer dans l'évaporateur. Le fluide frigorigène est ainsi préchauffé grâce à l'énergie récupérée du condenseur, ce qui améliore l'efficacité globale du cycle de réfrigération. Le principe de fonctionnement du régénérateur repose sur le fait que préchauffer le fluide frigorigène avant son entrée dans l'évaporateur permet de réduire la charge thermique sur ce dernier, ce qui se traduit par une consommation d'énergie moindre et des performances améliorées de l'appareil frigorifique. En d'autres termes, le régénérateur contribue à augmenter le coefficient de performance (COP) du système de réfrigération en réduisant les pertes d'énergie et en optimisant le transfert de chaleur. En conclusion, le régénérateur joue un rôle essentiel dans l'efficacité des machines frigorifiques, y compris les réfrigérateurs et congélateurs domestiques. En récupérant une partie de l'énergie rejetée par le condenseur pour préchauffer le fluide frigorigène, il contribue à améliorer les performances du système de réfrigération et à réduire la consommation d'énergie.

**对比学习损失**：用于促进网络学习不同模态间的正样本对比于负样本的区分性表示。 - **相互信息最大化**：鼓励模型最大化两个模态间的互信息，以学习更富信息的表示。 - **端到端的跟踪精度损失**：直接使用跟踪精度作为损失函数，可能需要设计不容易优化的非标准损失函数。 - **注意力约束**：如果您的模型中有注意力机制，可以设计损失来约束注意力权重，使得模型能够关注到对跟踪任务更有帮助的特征。 最终，是否新增损失函数应基于详细的实验评估和分析确定。建议实验不同的损失组合，并在验证集上评估它们对目标跟踪精度的影响。这样可以更有针对性地优化模型，实现更好的性能。"},{"prompt":"我们双模态双分支结构经过单独的vit专注自己的模态的特征增强，然后经过counter_guide_enhanced模块在vit第一层交互双模态特征信息，然后最后将经过12层提取的两个模态的特征concat，传给head执行跟踪任务，那么这样的双分支需要满足什么条件，即他们的目标同一性和差异性是什么？","completion":"在您描述的双模态双分支结构中，每个分支分别处理不同模态的数据（比如一分支处理RGB图像，另一分支处理事件数据），并通过\`Counter_Guide_Enhanced\`模块在早期层次进行交互，以增强双模态特征的融合。最终，两个模态提取的特征被连接(concatenate)起来，供后续的跟踪头部（head）使用。对于这种架构，我们需要考虑以下几点来确保模型的有效性和优化目标同一性与差异性： # 目标同一性条件 1. **互补性强化**：两个模态应该包含互补的信息，能够相互弥补对方的不足。比如，在低光照或高动态范围情境下，事件相机模态能提供RGB相机难以捕获的信息。 2. **特征融合策略**：\`Counter_Guide_Enhanced\`融合模块应该能够有效结合两种模态的特征，提取有用的信息以增强模型的表现。这意味着此模块应具备处理和优化不同模态特征差异的能力。 3. **模态权重调整**：应该有机制（如注意力机制）来调整不同模态的权重，让网络自动学习到在不同情况下哪种模态更为重要。 # 目标差异性要求 1. **处理模态差异**：尽管我们希望模型能从双模态中学习互补信息，但也需要注意处理好模态间的固有差异，比如分辨率、信号类型（事件vs. 图像）等的不同。模型应能在学习互补性的同时减小这些差异带来的影响。 2. **特异性保持**：在追求融合的同时，也需要保留每个模态特有的有效信息，避免过度平滑导致丢失重要特征。 3. **防止过拟合**：联合使用双模态数据时，模型参数量会相应增加，需要适当的正则化策略或数据增强避免过拟合。 # 实现建议 -

如果您的模型是一个多模态或多分支架构，且每个分支处理的数据类型或特征有明显的差异（例如，一个分支处理RGB图像，另一个分支处理事件相机数据），为每个分支设计特定的损失可能是有益的。这样做可以确保模型通过特定的损失函数来优化每种类型的数据处理，使得每个分支都能更有效地学习和提取对最终任务有利的特征信息。 # 2. **模型性能状况** - 如果您在某些评估指标上遇到性能瓶颈，或者发现模型在某些方面（如定位精度、特征区分能力等）的表现不足，引入针对特定分支的新损失函数可能有助于解决这些问题。通过精细调整损失函数，可以引导模型更加关注那些对最终性能影响较大的方面。 # 3. **计算和优化复杂性** - 引入额外的分支特定损失可能会增加模型训练的计算成本和优化难度。因为这意味着您需要平衡更多的目标，有时这些目标之间可能存在冲突。因此，需要仔细权衡性能改进和计算复杂性之间的关系，确认新增损失是否真正带来价值。 # 4. **实验验证** - 最重要的是，通过实际的实验验证来确定新增单个分支的损失是否真的有益。通过对比有无此类特定损失情况下的模型性能，可以更准确地评估其对最终任务目标的影响。 # 小结 总之，基于您的特定模型架构和任务需求，如果新增单个分支的损失能够提升模型性能或解决特定问题，那么这样做是合理的。然而，这一决策应该基于对目前模型性能的深入分析，并通过实验数据来验证其有效性。始终记住，任何模型设计或优化决策都应以增强模型的最终任务性能为目标。"},{"prompt":"因为当前的loss中L1损失占比最大，但是L1 loss不容易降低，那么考虑新增loss","completion":"当您注意到L1损失占比大且难以进一步降低时，引入新的损失函数确实可以考虑，特别是如果这能帮助模型在特定方面获得进步。选择或设计适合的损失函数时，可以考虑以下几个方向以补充或优化现有的L1损失对模型的引导： # 1. **增加对抗性损失（Adversarial Loss）** 适用于需要生成或重建细腻特征的任务。对抗性损失通过引入一个额外的判别器网络来促使生成的输出更加真实或符合目标分布。例如，在图像重建或风格转换任务中常用。在目标跟踪中，如果目标是生成或调整目标区域的表示，该方法可能有所帮助。 # 2. **结构相似度索引（SSIM）或多尺度SSIM损失** 特别是在图像相关任务中，SSIM损失可以衡量重建或预测图像与真实图像之间的结构相似性，这对于保持图像质量可能比L1损失有更好的效果。SSIM考虑了亮度、对比度和结构信息，因此可能在一些视觉任务中更适用。 # 3. **特征一致性损失** 例如，如果您的任务包括图像转换或风格迁移，通过确保不同层次上的特征表达保持一致，可以帮助网络学习到有用的、高级的特征表示。这种方法通常需要预训练的模型（如VGG）来提取特征，并计算目标输出与真实输出之间的特征相似度。 # 4. **中心损失（Center Loss）或三重项损失（Triplet Loss）** 这些损失函数设计用于加强学习到的特征的区分性，特别适合需要精确特征分离或嵌入的任务，如人脸识别或目标追踪。通过减小同一类别内部的距离同时增大不同类别间的距离，可以提升特征的区分能力。 # 5. **边界框回归损失改进** 对于目标跟踪等任务，改进边界框定位损失函数可能更直接有效。除了L1损失之外，考虑使用IoU损失、GIoU损失或DIoU、CIoU损失，这些损失对边界框回归任务可能更为适用，因为它们考虑了边界框之间的重叠区域。 # 实施建议： - **实验验证**：尝试不同的损失组合，并在验证集上评估模型性能，找出最适合您当前任务的损失函数。 - **损失权重**：当引入新的损失时，适当调整各损失项的权重至关重要，以避免某一损失过度主导而影响整体性能。 - **注意模型复杂性**：引入新损失函数可能会增加模型训练的难度和计算成本，因此需要权衡性能改进和额外负担。 通过这样的方法，可以在保留L1损失作为一部分的同时，更全面地指导模型学习，可能在降低总损失、提升模型性能方面取得更好的效果。"},{"prompt":"那么现在将GIoU loss替换为CIoU loss","completion":"替换GIoU损失为CIoU损失是目标检测和目标跟踪任务中一个常见的优化手段，因为CIoU损失（完整交并比损失）不仅考虑了预测框与真实框之间的重叠面积，还考虑了它们之间的中心点距离和形状相似度，从而提供了更全面的目标定位优化。以下是如何在您的模型中实现CIoU损失的示例： # 计算CIoU损失 首先，您需要一个函数来计算CIoU损失。以下是基于Python和PyTorch的一个简单实现： \`\`\`python import torch def bbox_cxcywh_to_xyxy(bbox): \\"\\"\\" 将bbox从中心宽度高度(cx, cy, w, h)格式转换为(x1, y1, x2, y2)格式 \\"\\"\\" x1 = bbox[..., 0] -

Cela peut être très utile dans les scripts bash où vous ne voulez traiter que les données et pas l'encombrement des en-têtes ou résumés. Si vous utilisez \`-t\` et que vous ne voyez plus les résultats des requêtes dans votre programme bash, voici quelques raisons possibles pour cela : 1. **Requête sans résultat** : Si la requête que vous exécutez ne renvoie aucun résultat (par exemple, une requête \`SELECT\` qui ne correspond à aucun enregistrement), vous ne verrez rien avec l'option \`-t\`, car il n'y a pas de tuples à afficher. 2. **Erreur dans la requête** : Si votre requête est mal formée ou rencontre une erreur à l'exécution, aucun résultat de tuple ne sera produit. Assurez-vous que votre requête fonctionne comme prévu en l'exécutant sans l'option \`-t\`. 3. **Sortie redirigée ou absorbée** : Dans le contexte de votre script bash, la sortie de la commande \`psql\` pourrait être redirigée vers un fichier ou une autre commande, ou encore absorbée par une condition ou une boucle qui n'affiche pas explicitement la sortie. Vérifiez comment vous gérez la sortie de la commande dans votre script. 4. **Usage incorrect de l'option \`-t\`** : Bien que ce soit moins probable, il est toujours bon de vérifier que l'option est utilisée correctement. Assurez-vous qu'elle est placée correctement dans la commande et qu'aucune autre option ou argument ne cause de conflit. Pour dépanner, commencez par exécuter votre commande \`psql\` directement dans le terminal (sans le script bash) avec et sans l'option \`-t\`, pour voir si les résultats s'affichent comme prévu.

He has gained modern notoriety primarily through a cuneiform tablet that is believed to be the oldest known complaint letter. Discovered in the ruins of Ur, the tablet is a message from a customer named Nanni, who was dissatisfied with the quality of copper ingots he received from Ea-nāṣir. The complaint also mentions issues related to a delayed delivery and grievances over the treatment Nanni's servant received upon visiting Ea-nāṣir to resolve the matter. This artifact offers us a fascinating glimpse into the commercial practices and communication methods of ancient Mesopotamia. It's particularly intriguing because it highlights not only the long history of trade relations and customer service complaints but also the complexity and sophistication of ancient Near Eastern societies, where merchants could engage in long-distance trade and clients could assert their rights through written complaints. Ea-nāṣir's fame in modern times comes largely from the humorous relatability of this ancient complaint, reminding us that some aspects of human nature and commerce remain constant through the ages. The tablet itself is held in the British Museum's collection, serving as a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of human history."},{"prompt":"quelles est la distance entre 2 pylones electriques haute tension ?","completion":"La distance entre deux pylônes électriques haute tension varie en fonction de multiples facteurs, tels que la tension de la ligne électrique, le type de terrain, la politique de l'entreprise d'électricité, et les exigences réglementaires locales. En général, pour des lignes à haute tension (supérieures à 100 kV), la distance entre les pylônes peut se situer entre 150 et 400 mètres. Pour des lignes de très haute tension (plusieurs centaines de kV), cette distance peut augmenter jusqu'à 400-600 mètres ou plus, en fonction des conditions spécifiques mentionnées précédemment. Il est important de noter que chaque projet de ligne électrique haute tension est unique, et les distances entre les pylônes sont déterminées par une planification détaillée qui prend en compte à la fois les aspects techniques et environnementaux."},{"prompt":"comment cette distance varie ne fonction de la pente ?","completion":"La distance entre les pylônes électriques haute tension peut varier significativement en fonction de la pente du terrain sur lequel la ligne est installée. Voici quelques points clés sur la façon dont cette distance peut être affectée par les pentes : # 1. **Tension Mécanique sur les Câbles** Sur un terrain pentu, la tension mécanique sur les câbles entre deux pylônes augmente. Pour minimiser cette tension et éviter un affaissement excessif des câbles (fleche), les ingénieurs peuvent opter pour des distances plus courtes entre les pylônes pour maintenir la ligne à une hauteur sûre au-dessus du sol ou d'autres obstacles. # 2. **Hauteur des Pylônes** Sur les pentes ascendantes ou descendantes, il peut être nécessaire d’ajuster la hauteur des pylônes au lieu de la distance qui les sépare. Un pylône placé sur un point haut peut être plus court, tandis que celui dans la vallée peut nécessiter d’être plus haut pour garder les câbles à la hauteur réglementaire par rapport au sol. Parfois, pour de très fortes pentes, une combinaison de réduction de la distance entre les pylônes et d'ajustement de la hauteur des pylônes est utilisée. # 3. **Éviter les Points de Tension Excessive** Les lignes haute tension doivent éviter de subir des tensions excessives qui pourraient causer des ruptures ou des affaissements importants. Sur des terrains avec des pentes raides, placer les pylônes de façon à ce que les lignes traversent les pentes à un angle oblique plutôt que directement de haut en bas peut aider à répartir la tension plus uniformément et peut nécessiter la modification de la distance entre les pylônes pour accommoder cet agencement. # 4. **Impact de l'Érosion et de la Stabilité du Sol** Le choix de la distance entre les pylônes et la conception des fondations doit tenir compte de la stabilité du terrain. Dans les zones à forte pente, l’érosion peut poser des risques significatifs pour la stabilité des pylônes. Des études géotechniques sont nécessaires pour définir non seulement la distance optimale entre les pylônes mais aussi pour assurer la conception appropriée des fondations. # 5. **Coût et Impact Environnemental** La réduction de la distance entre les pylônes sur des terrains difficiles peut augmenter les coûts de construction et avoir un impact environnemental plus important, en raison du nombre accru de pylônes nécessaires. Cet aspect est également pris en compte lors de la planification des lignes haute tension. # Conclusion La topographie est un facteur clé dans la planification et la construction des lignes électriques à haute tension. Les ingénieurs doivent trouver un équilibre entre les exigences techniques, la sécurité, les coûts, et l'impact environnemental lorsque la distance entre les pylônes est déterminée pour des terrains présentant des pentes ou des variations importantes de relief."},{"prompt":"si la distance entre 2 pylônes augmente, le poids des câbles ne risque t'il pas d'être trop important ?","completion":"Oui, si la distance entre deux pylônes électriques haute tension augmente, le poids des câbles tend effectivement à devenir plus important, ce qui soulève plusieurs préoccupations techniques : # 1. **Affaissement des Câbles (Fleche)** Avec des distances plus longues entre les pylônes, les câbles s'affaissent davantage sous leur propre poids. Cet affaissement doit être soigneusement calculé pour éviter que les câbles ne soient trop proches du sol ou d'autres objets, comme la végétation, afin de respecter les normes de sécurité et minimiser les risques d'accidents ou de pannes. # 2. **Tension sur les Câbles** L'augmentation du poids des câbles exerce une tension plus importante sur eux-mêmes et sur les structures des pylônes. Cela signifie que les pylônes doivent être conçus pour résister à ces forces supplémentaires, ce qui peut entraîner une augmentation des coûts de construction en raison des matériaux supplémentaires requis pour la structure des pylônes et des fondations. # 3. **Tension Mécanique sur les Pylônes** Les pylônes eux-mêmes subissent une tension accrue en raison du poids supplémentaire et de la tension des câbles tendus sur de plus longues portées. Cela peut nécessiter le renforcement des pylônes, en utilisant plus de matériaux ou des matériaux plus résistants, augmentant ainsi les coûts. # 4. **Problématiques Liées au Vent et à la Glace** Les longs segments de câbles sont plus susceptibles d'être affectés par le vent et l'accumulation de glace, ce qui peut accroître le poids des câbles et leur affaissement. Dans les régions où ces conditions sont fréquentes, des considérations supplémentaires doivent être prises pour s'assurer de la stabilité et de la sécurité de la ligne. # 5. **Choix des Matériaux** Pour de plus longues distances entre les pylônes, des matériaux spécifiques peuvent être nécessaires pour les câbles afin de réduire le poids total, comme l'utilisation de conducteurs en aluminium renforcé de fibres plutôt que des conducteurs en cuivre ou en aluminium simple, qui sont plus lourds. # 6. **Coûts et Viabilité** Les coûts de construction peuvent augmenter de manière significative avec l'augmentation de la distance entre les pylônes en raison des matériaux supplémentaires nécessaires et de la complexité accrue de la construction. Il est essentiel d'évaluer soigneusement le compromis entre la distance des portées et les coûts associés. En conclusion, bien que l'augmentation de la distance entre deux pylônes puisse offrir certains avantages, comme la réduction du nombre de pylônes nécessaires et potentiellement un impact visuel moindre, elle présente des défis techniques et financiers significatifs qui doivent être pris en compte dès la phase de conception d'une ligne de transmission électrique."},{"prompt":"résume moi tes 3 dernières réponse en 1 seul texte avec des valeurs numériques","completion":"Lors de la conception et de l'installation de lignes électriques à haute tension, plusieurs facteurs déterminent la distance optimale entre les pylônes, qui peut varier largement. Typiquement, pour des lignes haute tension, cette distance peut être comprise entre 150 et 600 mètres, en fonction de la tension des câbles, du type de terrain, et des conditions environnementales locales. Sur les terrains en pente, la distance entre les pylônes peut nécessiter un ajustement pour gérer la tension mécanique accrue sur les câbles due à la gravité et pour minimiser l’affaissement. Sur des pentes raides, une distance réduite entre les pylônes, combinée au réglage de leur hauteur, peut s'avérer nécessaire pour maintenir la sécurité et l'intégrité de la ligne. Cela permet de contrôler l'affaissement des câbles, qui augmente avec la distance et peut poser des risques si le câble se trouve trop proche du sol. Cependant, augmenter la distance entre les pylônes au-delà des normes habituelles - par exemple, dans une tentative de réduire le nombre de pylônes et l'impact visuel - introduit des défis significatifs. Le poids supplémentaire des câbles sur des portées plus longues exerce une tension accrue sur eux-mêmes et sur les pylônes, qui doivent alors être conçus pour résister à ces forces. L'affaissement des câbles s'intensifie également, nécessitant une attention accrue pour éviter le contact avec le sol ou des objets situés en dessous. Ainsi, même si une distance accrue entre les pylônes peut réduire le nombre de structures nécessaires, elle nécessite un renforcement des pylônes et des câbles et peut augmenter les coûts de construction en raison de matériaux supplémentaires et d'une conception plus complexe. Les choix de matériaux pour les câbles, la conception et la position des pylônes doivent tous être méticuleusement planifiés pour s'assurer que la ligne puisse résister aux conditions environnementales comme le vent et la glace, sans compromettre la sécurité ou les performances. En bref, la distance entre les pylônes de lignes électriques à haute tension doit équilibrer les exigences techniques, les coûts et l'impact environnemental, tout en prenant en compte les variations du terrain et les défis posés par des portées plus longues."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Экзогенные факторы риска, способствующие преждевременному старению организма, включают: 1. Ультрафиолетовое излучение: избыточное воздействие ультрафиолетовых лучей от солнца или солярия может повреждать кожу, приводя к преждевременному старению кожного покрова, появлению морщин, пигментации и потере упругости кожи. 2. Курение: табачный дым содержит вредные токсины, которые негативно влияют на клетки организма, включая кожу, и ускоряют процессы старения. 3. Воздействие загрязненной окружающей среды: загрязненный воздух, токсичные вещества, химические вещества могут наносить вред клеткам организма, ускоряя старение. 4. Несбалансированное питание: недостаток витаминов, минералов и антиоксидантов, а также чрезмерное потребление жиров, сахара и обработанных продуктов может способствовать преждевременному старению. 5. Стресс: хронический стресс оказывает негативное воздействие на организм, ускоряя процессы старения и приводя к различным заболеваниям. 6. Недостаточная физическая активность: отсутствие регулярных физических упражнений и низкий уровень физической активности могут способствовать ускорению старения организма. Уменьшение воздействия этих экзогенных факторов риска и поддержание здорового образа жизни может помочь предотвратить преждевременное старение и сохранить молодость и здоровье организма."},{"prompt":"эндогенные факторы риска преждевременного старения","completion":"Эндогенные факторы риска преждевременного старения связаны с внутренними особенностями организма, генетическими факторами и его внутренними процессами. Некоторые эндогенные факторы риска преждевременного старения включают в себя: 1. Генетическая предрасположенность: наследственность играет важную роль в процессах старения, и некоторые гены могут влиять на скорость старения организма и его возможности в борьбе со старением. 2. Уровень окислительного стресса: деятельность свободных радикалов, главных агентов окислительного стресса, может приводить к повреждению клеток и ускоренному старению организма. 3. Снижение уровня гормонов: снижение уровня определенных гормонов, таких как гормоны роста или эстрогены у женщин в перименопаузе, может способствовать старению организма и ухудшению состояния кожи, костей и др. 4. Снижение активности митохондрий: нарушение функций митохондрий, клеточных органелл, которые отвечают за производство энергии и обеспечение клеток кислородом, может быть связано со старением организма. 5. Возрастные изменения: естественные процессы старения, включая уменьшение скорости обмена веществ, потерю упругости кожи, изменения в тканях и органах, могут являться естественными эндогенными факторами риска преждевременного старения. Управление эндогенными факторами риска частично ограничивается нашим генетическим наследием, но ряд мероприятий, таких как здоровое питание, физическая активность, управление стрессом и лечение возможных нарушений гормонального баланса, могут помочь замедлить процессы старения и улучшить общее состояние организма."},{"prompt":"Объясни что такое научно-исследовательская работа простыми словами?","completion":"Научно-исследовательская работа – это подобно тому, как если бы ты стал детективом в мире знаний.

can i do to sell 17700 usdt for 17700 euros ?","completion":"To exchange 17,700 USDT for 17,700 Euros, you’d generally follow these steps, but keep in mind that getting an exact 1:1 value from USDT to Euros, especially after fees and potential exchange rate differences, can be challenging. Here's how to attempt it: 1. **Choose a Crypto Exchange or Platform**: Find a reliable cryptocurrency exchange or platform that supports both USDT and EUR transactions. Some well-known exchanges include Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase. These platforms often provide direct USDT to EUR conversions. 2. **Verify Exchange Rates and Fees**: Before proceeding, check the current USDT to EUR exchange rate and any transaction fees that the platform might charge. These fees can vary and may affect the final amount you receive in Euros. Some platforms offer more favorable rates or lower fees than others. 3. **Create or Log In to Your Account**: If you don’t already have an account on the chosen platform, you’ll need to create one. This process usually involves verifying your identity to comply with financial regulations (also known as KYC - Know Your Customer processes). 4. **Deposit USDT**: Transfer your 17,700 USDT from your wallet to your account on the chosen exchange. This step usually involves navigating to the deposit section of the exchange, selecting USDT, and then transferring to the address they provide. 5. **Exchange USDT for EUR**: Once your USDT is deposited, look for the option to sell or exchange USDT for EUR. Execute the trade, considering the amount and the offered rate. It's important to review the transaction details, including any conversion rates and fees, to ensure they're acceptable to you. 6. **Withdraw Euros to Your Bank Account**: After the trade, you can withdraw the Euros to your bank account. This process typically involves adding a bank account, verifying it if necessary, and then initiating a withdrawal. Be aware that there might be fees and it could take several days for the funds to appear in your bank account, depending on the platform and bank processing times. **Key Considerations**: - **Market Dynamics**: Exchange rates fluctuate regularly based on market conditions. The amount of Euros you can get for your USDT can vary from one moment to the next. - **Fees**: Pay close attention to all potential fees, including trading fees, withdrawal fees, and any third-party fees (like from your bank), as they will reduce the final amount you receive in Euros. - **Regulations and Limits**: Some platforms have withdrawal limits or specific regulations for converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency, affecting how you execute the transaction. Achieving a 1:1 conversion (17,700 USDT for 17,700 Euros) precisely may not be feasible once all fees are considered. Therefore, aim for the closest possible outcome, understanding there will likely be some difference due to the factors mentioned."},{"prompt":"Придумай идеи для написания простой, но полезной утилиты на языке программирования Си для новичка","completion":"Написание небольших и полезных утилит на языке Си может быть отличным способом практики для начинающих программистов.

Ariana's music frequently features catchy hooks, emotive lyrics, and a mix of both vulnerability and strength. Here's a modest attempt to create a song in a similar vein: --- **Verse 1:** Walking through the rain, but I don't feel the cold, Thoughts of you, they keep me warm, embolden and bold. Every streetlight, a reminder of the spark we hold, In a world turning silver and gold, our story's untold. **Chorus:** 'Cause when the night falls, your name's the one I call, Amidst the echoes, our love outlasts it all. With every heartbeat, I'm standing ten feet tall, In your love, I find the strength to never fall. **Verse 2:** Every melody I sing, laced with traces of you, Finding solace and rhythm in everything we've been through. Your voice, a harmony, in days grey or blue, In the chorus of life, it's us two, forever true. **Chorus:** 'Cause when the night falls, your name's the one I call, Amidst the echoes, our love outlasts it all. With every heartbeat, I'm standing ten feet tall, In your love, I find the strength to never fall. **Bridge:** In the silence, in the crowd, your heart's melody loud, Through the ups and the downs, love's the only sound. We're a symphony in the making, with no room for faking, With you, every rule I'm breaking, it's breathtaking. **Chorus:** 'Cause when the night falls, your name's the one I call, Amidst the echoes, our love outlasts it all. With every heartbeat, I'm standing ten feet tall, In your love, I find the strength to never fall. **Outro:** And if the stars decide to not shine tonight, In your arms, I'll still find my light. Together, we're a sight so bright, Forever, in love, we'll take flight. --- This song tries to encapsulate themes of enduring love, personal empowerment, and the magical feeling of finding strength and identity in a relationship, much like Ariana Grande's impactful music does. From deeply emotive lyrics to potential high-energy beats, it highlights the journey of love and self-discovery, aiming to resonate with listeners on a personal level."},{"prompt":"Напиши более научным языком: Ну и ценник, который приходится платить за последствия этих аварий, он катастрофический, конечно, никакой рыночек там ничего не порешает, никакой бизнес такие убытки, которые исчисляются в сотни миллиардов долларов от одной крупной аварии, оплатить не в состоянии.

Together, Gloopy and Glitter are an unstoppable team, complementing each other’s abilities and personalities as they embark on intergalactic adventures, spreading good vibes and glitter dust across the cosmos. Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Episode: “The Barren Planet of Shadows” Scene 1: Lost in the Cosmos - The blob-mobile zips across the cosmos, its warp drive allowing Gloopy and Glitter to push the boundaries of their explorations like never before. - Suddenly, the warp drive sputters, and alarms blare. They’re pulled into the gravitational field of an uncharted planet. Gloopy: “Whoa, the warp drive is acting up. We’re going in for an unexpected landing, Glitter!” Glitter: “Hang on, Gloopy! Let’s make this an opportunity to discover something new!” - The blob-mobile makes a bouncy touchdown onto the surface of a dusty, gray planet devoid of color and light. Scene 2: The Mysterious Terrain - Stepping out of their ship, Gloopy and Glitter look around at the stark landscape. Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks. - The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows. Gloopy: “This place could use some of our sparkly charm, don’t you think?” Glitter: “Definitely. It’s so… drab.” Scene 3: The Shadow Stir - As they traverse the dull terrain, seeking materials to repair the blob-mobile, Gloopy’s gooey footprints and Glitter’s sparkly trail are the only sources of brightness in this gloomy world. - Unexpectedly, the shadows cast by the dim star begin to move and swirl around their bright paths. It’s as if the shadows are alive, curious, and drawn to their light. Glitter (puzzlement shimmering in her eyes): “Do you see that, Gloopy? The shadows are moving!” Gloopy: “They seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!” Scene 4: The Connection - As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them. - This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication. Glitter (excitedly): “Gloopy, they’re smart! Let’s see if we can understand them.” Scene 5: Learning and Teaching - Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses. - After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another. Gloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.” Glitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop. Gloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!” Glitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!” Scene 7: The Transformation - As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see. Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. Title: “Gloopy’s Shape Sensation” Scene 1: An Unexpected Audience - Our adventure begins with Gloopy and Glitter exploring the vast cosmos, powered by the warp drive they won from “The Great Space Entry” competition. Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts. Glitter: “Gloopy, I’ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes—circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture. Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation. Announcer: “Presenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!” - With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later!

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals!

User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content.

We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back!

Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix.

User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait!

With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines. Yet, as we mourn their departure, we also welcome with open arms the new contenders set to fill the void: “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” provided us with laughter, creativity, and endless entertainment. “Lamput,” with its minimalistic yet expressive animation, gave us a silent but hilariously dynamic orange blob constantly escaping the clutches of dimwitted scientists. “Planet Sketch” took us on a rollercoaster of comedy with its diverse cast of characters and unpredictable scenarios. Their contribution to the realm of animated shorts will not be forgotten, but in the entertainment industry, the show must go on.

Their adventures are guaranteed to lead to laughter-inducing disasters, promising a delightful twist to our Saturday mornings. In addition to “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox” aims to strike a chord with Pokémon fans old and new. This musical short brings the nostalgic tunes from the Pokémon universe to a new generation, possibly reigniting passions for the original series while delighting fans with catchy melodies and vibrant animations inspired by their favorite pocket monsters. Not to be overlooked, “GoGoWiki” is another innovative concept introduced by CW4Kids. It aims to deepen the connection between viewers and the “GoGoRiki” universe. This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening. While we reminisce about the creativity and laughter brought to us by “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” the arrival of “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki” marks a refreshing beginning with endless possibilities. CW4Kids continues to demonstrate its commitment to delivering diverse, quality content that captivates the imaginations of its young audience. in the process, ensuring that the legacy of Saturday morning cartoons not only endures but evolves. As we embrace this transition, it’s clear that while we may say “Lamput and Planet Sketch are dead,” the spirit of innovative, entertaining, and beloved shorts lives on through “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” Long live the new kings and queens of CW4Kids’ animated shorts!

Also, here's the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition! While we can’t reveal much just yet, rest assured that CW4Kids is dedicated to bringing you quality animation and exciting new shows. “Coming Soon” means new adventures are on the horizon, so stay tuned for more updates and thank you for sticking with us through this new chapter!

Seeing him in action in the promo, even if just for a second, assures me that “GoGoRiki” is going to inject some serious fun into the lineup. CW4Kids is pulling out all the stops! User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch!

The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment.

Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store. Thanks for being such dedicated viewers, and remember, new discoveries await every Saturday on CW4Kids! Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Preview Extravaganza Talkback - Embracing the New Era” User1: ToonVisionary Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:00 PM Just watched the CW4Kids Spring Preview Extravaganza, and wow, what a showcase! Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since “just after Christmas,” making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking? User2: DigitalDawn Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM The preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially “Pokemon Horizons” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,” has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who’ve been here through it all. User3: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM I appreciated the nod to the transition period—it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Chaotic” looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting! User4: RetroRewind Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM The whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza! Our aim was to celebrate both the journey we’ve embarked on since “just after Christmas” and the exciting path ahead.

Stay tuned for tomorrow’s big launch, and thank you for joining us on this incredible ride! Forum Thread Title: “Ads Aired on CW4Kids April 6th – What Did You Catch?” User1: AdSpotterSam Posted on April 7, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yesterday was quite the day on CW4Kids with the “Johnny Test” farewell ad pulling on our heartstrings. But throughout the day, I noticed a bunch of other interesting ads leading up to the big Spring Preview Extravaganza. Did anyone else keep track of what aired? I caught a few but felt like I might have missed some! User2: ToonPromoPat Posted on April 7, 2024, at 10:20 AM I got you, Sam! Made a point to jot down what aired – here’s a list of 7 ads I caught on CW4Kids April 6th, right before the JT farewell and the big preview event: 1. Pokémon Horizons: The Series – Pushing the new adventures in the Paldea region, definitely amping up the excitement. 2. Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds – Highlighting the high-speed Turbo Duels that are new to the series. 3. GoGoRiki – A spotlight on the comedic aspect of the channel, featuring short clips of the characters’ funny antics. 4. Viva Pinata – Seems like they’re betting big on this for comedic relief, had a very vibrant ad focused on the party theme. 5. Code Lyoko – Reminder that the adventures in the virtual world are continuing, with a focus on intense action scenes. 6. Sonic X – Trailering Sonic’s high-speed adventures, with a nod to starting from episode 1 for newcomers. 7. Spring Lineup Preview Extravaganza hosted by Gloopy – Honestly, this was teased throughout the day, highlighting it as the event not to miss with exclusive sneak peeks. Each ad had that new, tech-energy vibe CW4Kids is going for. Really sets the tone for the new direction! User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on April 7, 2024, at 10:40 AM Thanks for the roundup, ToonPromoPat! Those ads really did an excellent job showcasing the diversity and energy of the upcoming lineup. The Spring Lineup Preview Extravaganza ad had me on the edge of my seat with anticipation. CW4Kids seems all-in on making the new era memorable. User4: SaturdayMorningSpectator Posted on April 7, 2024, at 11:00 AM Caught those ads too, and each one was more exciting than the last. It’s interesting how they’re blending the old with the new, especially with “Sonic X” starting over. That Spring Lineup Preview Extravaganza ad was everywhere, building up hype like no tomorrow. Can’t wait to see what’s next! User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 7, 2024, at 11:30 AM Every ad felt like a piece of a bigger puzzle revealing the new CW4Kids identity. I’m particularly curious about how “Viva Pinata” and “GoGoRiki” will fit into the mix with their lighter, comedic tones. The constant teases for the Preview Extravaganza definitely paid off – was an event not to be missed! Also, given the new lineup trailers, goodbye Johnny Test advert, Pogoriki's Easter Sweepstakes ad that aired on March 30, and the amended GoGoRiki, Sonic X, Kirby, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko promos, we now know what the new look looks like, 4Kids website header/banner is at the top (with logo and 10 shows), there are buttons (e.g Win, Sign On, Coming Up, Now Next Later) with the logo in the centre of the background. Trailer style is clicking Coming Up to reveal an online video player with the promo, Win does the same, so assuming Sign On will launch the video player, which will then take us into the show, Not sure who made it, considering DixonBaxi (Did the UK's Channel 5 logo for 2008), MMMultiply and Proud Creative (did S4C's 2009 \\"Magnetic\\" idents, rebrand, and logo) all submitted pictches to 4Kids in late January, judging by this report, CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 7, 2024, at 12:00 PM Glad you all noticed and appreciated the variety in the ads leading up to our Spring Lineup Preview Extravaganza! Our goal was to give a taste of the vibrant, action-packed, and humorous content CW4Kids is bringing to your Saturday mornings.

I’ve always enjoyed the quirky adventures and the unique storytelling of the show, but I guess it’s time for something new. Does anyone have the inside scoop on what’s coming next? Hoping for something just as engaging! User2: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 15, 2024, at 10:30 AM Sad to see “Tomodachi Life” go, but I’m curious about what’s replacing it. 4Kids TV has always had a knack for bringing in interesting and diverse content. Maybe we’ll get something fresh that aligns with the innovative direction they’ve been heading in lately, similar to the excitement brewing over at CW4Kids. User3: RetroGamerGeek Posted on April 15, 2024, at 11:00 AM I heard rumors they might be introducing a new game-based animated series. “Tomodachi Life” had its charm with the video game tie-in, so maybe they’re continuing that trend. Whatever it is, hoping it captures the imagination and fun “Tomodachi Life” brought to the table. User4: AnimationEnthusiast Posted on April 15, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s bittersweet for sure. “Tomodachi Life” was a unique blend of humor and video game culture. But considering the evolving landscape of children’s programming, I’m optimistic about the new addition. The folks at 4Kids TV have always surprised us with captivating shows. Fingers crossed for another hit!

It’s such a small detail but adds so much depth to their characters. The animation team did an impressive job, making their movements feel so fluid and lifelike. It’s these little nuances that really elevate the show for me! User2: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 20, 2024, at 2:25 PM Absolutely, @SlimeFanatic!

What do you all think – are we going to see more alterations down the pipeline? User2: ToonSavvySam Posted on April 25, 2024, at 10:00 AM Given the transition and the push towards new content, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more schedule shake-ups in the coming months. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” fills a unique niche, and its move might be a test to integrate more CW4Kids exclusives or fresh shows into 4Kids TV. Keeping an eye on how they juggle the lineup post-May. User3: RetroRewind Posted on April 25, 2024, at 10:30 AM I heard from a reliable source that “World of Quest” is returning to the CW4Kids block on June 8! 🗺️✨ But interestingly, the 4Kids webmaster who mentioned this was clear that it doesn’t signal a comeback for other former Kids WB shows like “Teen Titans Go,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Johnny Test.” Seems like they’re being selective with what they reintroduce. User4: SaturdayMorningSpeculator Posted on April 25, 2024, at 11:00 AM That’s intriguing news about “World of Quest,” @RetroRewind! It shows they’re willing to revive certain shows but are also drawing a clear line on what makes it back to the rotation. As for the broader 4Kids TV programming, “Gloopy and Glitter” stepping into the 9 AM slot could definitely be a sign of more to come. I’m curious if they’ll lean more towards exclusives or explore original content. User5: NextGenToonWatcher Posted on April 25, 2024, at 11:45 AM “World of Quest” coming back is a pleasant surprise! 🎉 As for 4Kids TV, “Gloopy and Glitter” could signal a renewal, maybe even a refresh of the 4Kids identity by embracing a mix of older popular shows while also introducing new or revitalized content. But the specific exclusion of certain shows returning makes me wonder about the criteria they’re using for these decisions. User6: 4KidsEnthusiast Posted on April 25, 2024, at 12:30 PM The selectiveness in bringing back “World of Quest” but not the others might be about fitting into the current brand image or audience expectations. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” moving to 4Kids TV hints they’re exploring content that resonates with today’s viewers while wagering on nostalgia selectively. It feels like a strategy to balance legacy with innovation. User7: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 25, 2024, at 1:00 PM This approach indicates a thoughtful but targeted nostalgia play, mixed with a willingness to evolve the programming. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” could set the tone for what’s to come on 4Kids TV. Plus, “World of Quest’s” return suggests a method to their madness in reviving only specific shows. Here’s to hoping for an interesting and entertaining mix in the future! 4KidsTVWebMod Posted on April 25, 2024, at 1:30 PM We appreciate all the excitement and speculation! While I can’t spill too many beans, it’s safe to say that the insertion of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” into the 9 AM slot and the return of “World of Quest” to CW4Kids are part of our broader vision for offering dynamic, engaging content to our audience.

This new lineup expansion has me hyped! But it does make me wonder about the fate of “Viva Pinata,” “TMNT: Back to the Sewers,” and “Sonic X” when the new three shows join this Fall. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on June 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM That’s definitely exciting news about the lineup change and extension! “Four Eyes!” replacing “Kirby” is pretty interesting—I’ve been curious about “Four Eyes!” since they announced it. And “World of Quest” coming back? Yes, please! As for “Viva Pinata,” “TMNT: Back to the Sewers,” and “Sonic X,” it’s tough to say. Maybe they’ll shuffle the schedule around to keep them? CW4Kids seems good at balancing their content. User3: ToonTrackerTim Posted on June 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m thrilled about the block extension and “World of Quest” returning; it’s been missed. “Four Eyes!” sounds intriguing, and slotting it into “Kirby’s” time could bring a fresh vibe to that part of the morning. Regarding the assumptions that “Viva Pinata,” “TMNT: Back to the Sewers,” and “Sonic X” might be on the chopping block for the Fall newcomers—I think it’s a bit early to jump to conclusions. CW4Kids has a knack for surprising us with how they manage their programming. User4: RetroToonRanger Posted on June 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s sad to see “Kirby” go, but change can be good. “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” add new flavors to the mix. However, I share the concern about “Viva Pinata,” “TMNT: Back to the Sewers,” and “Sonic X.” They each have their charm and audience. Hopefully, if they are removed, it’s for equally compelling content. But yes, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves worrying about the uncertain Fall lineup. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on June 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Four Eyes!” seems to have potential, and extending the block is a bold move showing CW4Kids’ commitment to Saturday morning fun. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for “Viva Pinata,” “TMNT,” and “Sonic X.” CW4Kids has been balancing classics with new shows well so far, so let’s hope they find a way to retain or suitably replace these beloved series in the Fall. Let’s not forget, networks evolve, and sometimes that means tough decisions. User6: DigitalDawn Posted on June 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The additional half-hour is a sign of CW4Kids doubling down on providing more quality content, which is promising. “World of Quest” at noon sounds like the perfect way to cap the Saturday morning experience. It’s intriguing to speculate about the Fall newcomers and the shift they might cause, but CW4Kids has always managed to keep a balanced and entertaining lineup. Let’s trust in their programming strategy! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on June 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM Thanks for all the enthusiasm and speculation, everyone! We’re delighted to bring you an expanded lineup starting June 8th with “Four Eyes!” and the return of “World of Quest.” We understand the concern about the fate of “Viva Pinata,” “TMNT: Back to the Sewers,” and “Sonic X.” Rest assured, our goal is always to deliver the best mix of entertainment for our audience.

They’ve finally revealed the creative team behind the CW4Kids rebrand, and guess what? It wasn't DixonBaxi as many of us speculated—turns out they were disqualified early on for proposing a concept too similar to the previous comic book branding. Instead, the rebrand was designed by Proud Creative, the folks behind the S4C \\"Magnetic\\" look! Their innovative approach has brought a fresh, tech-vibe to the network, aligning perfectly with CW4Kids' new direction. Thoughts? User2: ToonTrendWatcher Posted on June 10, 2024, at 9:30 AM I'm not surprised DixonBaxi was out of the running; CW4Kids needed a departure from the old comic branding to truly signify a new era. Proud Creative taking the reins makes sense—just look at their work with S4C. The tech-themed visuals they’ve introduced have successfully propelled CW4Kids into a modern, digital age. It’s exciting to see such a significant transformation managed so artistically! User3: AnimationAficionado Posted on June 10, 2024, at 10:00 AM This rebrand has indeed been a breath of fresh air, and knowing Proud Creative is behind it cements the idea that CW4Kids was aiming for a blend of style and substance. Moving away from the comic book aesthetic was a bold move, but it’s paid off, making the network feel more contemporary and aligned with today's viewing habits. Proud Creative’s prowess in creating engaging visuals shines through the new CW4Kids identity. User4: CreativeConnoisseur Posted on June 10, 2024, at 10:45 AM Proud Creative stepping in explains the drastic yet appealing shift in aesthetics. Their work often embodies a balance between appeal and innovation, something CW4Kids desperately needed for its rebrand. It’s fascinating how they’ve maintained a sense of familiarity while steering the network towards a future-centric look. Kudos to 4Kids for making a choice that truly revitalizes the Saturday morning cartoon experience! User5: NostalgiaNavigator Posted on June 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM The choice to disqualify DixonBaxi for sticking too close to the previous branding highlights 4Kids’ commitment to revolutionizing CW4Kids. The new look achieved by Proud Creative is not just a visual update; it’s a statement—a promise of innovation and engagement. The tech vibe fits perfectly with the digital era, appealing to both new viewers and longtime fans craving fresh content. User6: DigitalDesignDabbler Posted on June 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM Absolutely, @NostalgiaNavigator. Proud Creative's knack for integrating modern design sensibilities with user engagement is evident in the CW4Kids rebrand. It feels like a step into the future, making the network more relatable to today's tech-savvy kids while retaining the charm that made Saturday mornings special. The strategic shift away from the comic book theme represents a new chapter, an evolution rather than just a simple makeover. User7: TooniverseTrekker Posted on June 10, 2024, at 12:45 PM It's a joy seeing CW4Kids flourish under this new identity crafted by Proud Creative. The rebrand isn’t just visually appealing; it’s a bridge to a broader, more diverse world of animation that respects the past while boldly stepping into the future. This decision by 4Kids shows their foresight in keeping the network both relevant and revolutionary. Can’t wait to see where this new look takes us in the journey of Saturday morning cartoons! 4KidsTVWebMod Posted on June 10, 2024, at 1:00 PM Thank you all for your enthusiastic responses to the CW4Kids rebrand!

Let’s decode it into a description of Jupiter’s atmospheric and internal structure, considering 🟫 to represent denser material layers and ⬜ to symbolize less dense, gaseous layers or transitions between them. 1. **Outer Atmosphere (🟫🟫🟫):** This layer represents Jupiter’s visible atmosphere, made up of hydrogen and helium with traces of other gases, which forms the colorful bands and spots observable from Earth. The outermost part is where the dynamic weather systems, including the famous Great Red Spot, are located. 2. **Transition Zone (⬜⬜⬜):** These blocks could signify the transition between the outer gaseous layers and the more dense interior, perhaps representing the region where gas gradually compresses and heats up, though not yet reaching the metallic hydrogen phase. This zone might not be sharply defined in reality but signifies a gradual change in composition and state. 3. **Metallic Hydrogen Layer (🟫🟫⬜⬜⬜⬜):** The initial 🟫🟫 represents the layer of metallic hydrogen that begins deeper within Jupiter. In this state, hydrogen acts as an electrical conductor due to the immense pressure and temperature. The sequential ⬜⬜⬜⬜ could illustrate the extent of this layer's thickness and the gradual transition to more dense inner layers. 4. **Core Transition (🟫🟫):** The last two 🟫 blocks might represent the dense core, or the approach to it, consisting of heavier elements possibly mixed with metallic hydrogen and helium in a dense, hot, and pressurized state. The exact composition of Jupiter’s core is still a subject of research, with some models suggesting it may be rocky or a mixture of heavy elements. This representation simplifies Jupiter’s complex structure into a more accessible form. In reality, Jupiter’s layers transition smoothly without clear boundaries, and the planet's internal characteristics are inferred from gravitational and magnetic fields measurements, along with theoretical models since direct observation is currently beyond our capability."},{"prompt":"lets say that you are a ui ux designer with 20 years of experience design a walkthrough process for web app of managing charging parks for electric vecules","completion":"Designing a walkthrough process for a web application requires a balance between simplicity, informative guidance, and efficiency.

A fontosabb különbségek közé tartozik a következők: 1. **A \`kincsek\` Map inicializálása:** - A te kódodban a \`kincsek\` Map-et a \`KincsesSziget\` konstruktorban inicializálod a kapott paraméterrel. - A helyes megoldásban a \`kincsek\` Map-et már deklarációnál inicializálják egy új \`HashMap\` példánnyal. Ez azonban nem okoz lényegi különbséget a működésben, mivel mindkét esetben a Map-et a konstruktorban lévő paraméter határozza meg. 2. **Kincsek összértékének számítása:** - Mindkét kódban a kincsek összértékének számítása megegyezik (a kincsek értékeinek és a kulcsok hosszának összegzése), de az elnevezés eltér. Te \`osszErtek\`, míg a helyes megoldás \`kincsOsszertek\` nevet használ.

Az összehasonlítás módja megegyezik: először az összértékek alapján történik összehasonlítás, majd társszerződés esetén a tulajdonosok nevei alapján. 4. **Szigetek törlése:** - A törlési folyamatod során egy külön listát hozol létre a törlendő szigetek számára, majd azt iterációval töröld. A helyes megoldás egy elegánsabb módszert alkalmaz a \`removeIf\` metódussal, ami közvetlenül a feltétel alapján távolítja el az elemeket. Ez hatékonyabb, mert nem igényel külön iterációt a törlendő szigetek gyűjtésére és törlésére. Mindkét megoldás megvalósítja az elvárt funkcionalitást. Azonban a helyes megoldás néhány helyen kifinomultabb vagy hatékonyabb megközelítést alkalmaz (pl. közvetlen törlés \`removeIf\`-el), ami előnyös lehet nagyobb adathalmazok esetén vagy a kód olvashatóságának és karbantarthatóságának szempontjából."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim to waste their time and resources.

I am eager to clear up any confusion at the earliest opportunity. To aid in your efforts and to further affirm my willingness to cooperate, could you kindly provide more detailed information regarding the investigation?

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude and excitement upon receiving such wonderful news. It feels almost surreal to be at this juncture after what seemed like an endless wait. Learning about the approval and subsequent crediting of the US7,800,000 onto an ATM card by the Federal Reserve Bank has infused my day with an incredible sense of joy and anticipation. Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to you and your team for the diligence and integrity you have demonstrated throughout this process. It is a huge relief to know that the card can be used globally, offering both flexibility and accessibility which is what I had hoped for. Regarding the various FAQs you provided, they are incredibly helpful and have preempted many of the queries I had in mind. It’s reassuring to know that the card does not necessitate having a bank account and that it’s compatible with ATMs worldwide, not to mention the added benefit of being able to engage in credit card purchases. Before I proceed with the courier fee, I wanted to clarify a few points to ensure a seamless process hereon: 1. Given the significance and sensitivity of the ATM card, I lean towards opting for a service that promises both speed and reliability. Between the options of DHL and FedEx, both quoted at 50 for couriering the card, which would you recommend based on your experience for a safe and expedient delivery? 2. To ensure the utmost security and proper handling of the card, I am inclined to pay for the premium insurance option you mentioned. Could you please confirm if the third-class insurance you’ve provided is the highest tier available, or if there are more comprehensive options? I have a small favor to ask – would it be possible to receive a picture or any form of visual confirmation of the ATM card before it is couriered? This is merely for personal reassurance and to savor the moment of achievement after a long wait. Once you provide the final go-ahead with the recommended courier option and confirm the insurance details, I will promptly send the required fee to the attorney’s details via Western Union or MoneyGram. Please forward the final sum along with the attorney’s most up-to-date receiving details to eliminate any room for error. As for the logistical details you requested: 1.

It's comforting to know that we are moving towards the final stages of this exciting journey. The attachment with the visual confirmation of the ATM card has indeed filled me with great ease and anticipation. I appreciate the arrangements you have made for the delivery, and your guidance has been invaluable throughout this process. After considering your advice and the options available, I believe proceeding with the Western Union transfer for the courier fee seems most prudent, especially under the current circumstances with your receiver's sudden travel to Nigeria. Regarding the payment through Bitcoin, I must admit that I find myself in a bit of a pickle. While I am familiar with cryptocurrency transactions, I recently encountered some security issues with my digital wallet. As a precaution, my assets are temporarily frozen while the service provider conducts a thorough audit. This unexpected hiccup has left me unable to transact through Bitcoin for the time being. Therefore, the Western Union option is more feasible for me at this moment. I am ready to proceed with this traditional method once I receive the receiver's name and the exact amount to be sent, ensuring we leave no room for error or delay. I also wanted to reiterate the importance of ensuring the highest tier of insurance for the ATM card's delivery. Given its significant value, both financially and personally, I am willing to cover any additional cost this might entail. Your advice on opting for the best insurance coverage was well-received, and I trust your judgment in selecting the optimal choice. To prepare for the transfer, could you kindly confirm: 1. The receiver's full name and location for the Western Union transfer. 2. The total amount to be sent, including the courier fee and the premium insurance coverage. 3. Any specific instructions or reference numbers I should include in the transfer to expedite the process. Once I have these details, I will visit my nearest Western Union outlet first thing tomorrow morning and ensure the fee is sent off without delay. Following the transfer, I will email you the transaction details, including the MTCN, for immediate verification and processing from your end. I eagerly await your final instructions so we can conclude this matter smoothly and celebrate the successful delivery of the ATM card. Thank you once again for your support and patience.

I understand the critical importance of timeliness in these matters and share your desire to see to the successful culmination of our project. I will follow up directly with Barrister Garnett today and then provide you with an update, ensuring you are kept in the loop at every turn. It’s my hope and belief that with these actions, we are paving the way towards not just the successful withdrawal of the petition but towards the achievement of our greater goal.

Wishing you a productive day ahead. I will be in touch soon with further developments.

Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #9, from Steve: United States Reconciliation Committee 1114 6th Ave #17thW. R. Grace Building, New York, NY 10110, USA Direct no: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER> Dear Cameron McCaffrey, This is to acknowledge your mail. Yes, why you are being scammed is that; 1. you know quite well that you did not execute any contract with the government. 2. You do not have any funds to claim in your name with the government. 3. Some top government officials were the ones that wrote to you to stand as the beneficiary of the said fund. They will change everything to your name as the beneficiary of the fund. 4. The real contractor that executed the contract has been paid fully but those that awarded the contract over-invoiced the fund ( which is an excess) 5. Because then they were still active government staff so they sort a way by looking for a foreigner that stands as the next of kin to pull out the excess funds stated in the invoice. Although, they made the Federal government know that the real contractor that executed the project has died which is now the reason you were contacted as the next of kin to claim the excess invoice fund. 6. The top official that contacted you in the first place made you understand that you would be made as the beneficiary of the fund by using their power in the government that you are the beneficiary of the fund but along the line; those top officials were retired from office. Hence, they could not come to a conclusion to what they have started. 7. But the lawyer that assisted them for all the documentation was the one that filed a petition against you in the Federal ministry of Justice and they now with-hold your funds which is the reason you have been facing problems. 8. Your fund is genuine and does exist in the system and this is the reason several people have been contacting you and failing to inform you the truth about your fund whereby you keep on sending money unnecessarily to them because they do not know that a petition was filed against you. So, they also keep on finding all means to pull out your money without knowing the root cause of them not succeeding . Unknown to them that the real lawyer who started or knows the genesis about the fund is the one that filed a petition against your fund. 9. You and I know the truth of this. Right now, I have contacted the lawyer and pleaded with him to withdraw the petition against your fund from the Federal ministry of Justice and the lawyer has done it because I made a promise to him that immediately you receive your fund that you will pay him all his benefits. 10. Since you have known the truth of everything, the reason you have been encountering several problems of not receiving your fund; what I want you to do now is for you to stop every communication with anybody regarding this your fund. Henceforth, any mail that you do receive, do forward it to me for proper advice before you do anything and to save you from unauthorised people. Finally, I want you to go ahead and contact the bank that is in-charge of your fund immediately you receive this mail. BANK NAME: CREDIT AGRICOLE NEXT BANK UK.

Your detailed explanation has provided a new perspective on the challenges I’ve been facing in securing the said funds. It’s been a convoluted journey, filled with uncertainties, and receiving your email has been a turning point. The intricacies involved, especially the involvement of high-ranking officials and the subsequent legal hurdles, are more intricate than I initially realized. The notion that a petition has been filed against me, unbeknownst to me until now, is particularly concerning yet enlightening. It explains the myriad of obstacles that have mysteriously surfaced at every turn, preventing me from accessing the funds. I am relieved to learn from you that the lawyer has withdrawn the petition, thanks to your intervention. It’s comforting to know that there are still individuals like you striving for justice and transparency in these complex proceedings. The promise you made to the lawyer, ensuring his benefits upon the successful transfer of my fund, is a gesture I deeply respect and agree to uphold. Per your advice, I will cease all communications with other parties regarding this matter and direct any future inquiries or correspondences through you for guidance. This newfound clarity you’ve provided necessitates a careful and considered approach moving forward, and I value your expertise in navigating these uncharted waters. Following your instructions, I am preparing to contact CREDIT AGRICOLE NEXT BANK UK, specifically Ms. Elizabeth Shortino, with the details you outlined. Before doing so, I seek your further counsel on a few points to ensure I proceed with all necessary precautions: A. Documentation: Should I request any specific documentation from the bank to verify the status of the fund and the legitimacy of the transfer process? B. Legal Clearance: Given the previous legal challenges, is there any form of clearance or official communication I should request from the lawyer to confirm the withdrawal of the petition? C. Communication: For all future correspondence with the bank and any other involved parties, would you recommend any specific security measures to ensure the privacy and integrity of our communications? D. Verification: Upon contacting Ms. Elizabeth Shortino, are there any verification steps you advise I undertake to confirm her authority and the bank’s commitment to facilitating this transfer? I stand ready to take the necessary steps as advised by you and look forward to finally bringing closure to this matter. Your offer to guide and protect my interests has been a beacon of hope amidst the confusion and deceit I’ve encountered. I will contact the bank as instructed and keep you updated on all developments. Thank you once again for your pivotal role in this process. Awaiting your guidance on the above queries.

Use the name Cameron McCaffrey and email cmccaff1@fau.edu Hello, I just read your e-mail regarding my apartment located in Koningstraat 3, 9000 Gent. It has 2 bedrooms, living room, bathroom and kitchen. I bought this apartment for my daughter during her studies in Belgium, but now she's back home permanently, so I'm renting the place for unlimited time. The flat is exactly like in the pictures, fully furnished and renovated. Also, very important, the utilities (cold/hot water, electricity, wireless broadband Internet, digital TV, 1 parking spots, dishwasher, garbage disposal, microwave, refrigerator, washing machine, etc.) are INCLUDED in the price of €600/month. Now, a little bit about myself so we can get to know each other better. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I'm a 58 years old structural engineer and I work for MWH Global Engineering. I worked hard to have a good career and I really respect hard earned money. The company I work for they have projects all around the world so most of my time I'm traveling. I have a lovely wife, Sarah and a 25 year old daughter, Maria. I am very proud to say that soon I'm going to be a grandfather :). Another member of our family is a 8 year old Labrador which we all love, so, I have no problem if you will keep pets. I'm in Roma/Italy now and I work for a new project here and the only inconvenience is that my job doesn't allow me to leave Roma even for one single day. We just hired some new staff and I'm in charge of their training. But this won't affect you at all. I can make arrangements to rent the apartment from Roma (on my expense of course). Looking forward to hear from you soon. All the best from Italy! Arthur Reimann","completion":"Subject: Re: Inquiry About Your Apartment in Gent Hello Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you so much for your prompt and detailed reply regarding the apartment at Koningstraat 3, 9000 Gent. The features you've described and the inclusive utilities package sound exactly like what I've been searching for, and the price is within my budget, which is fantastic news! Firstly, let me congratulate you on the forthcoming addition to your family – becoming a grandfather is undoubtedly a joyous milestone. It’s heartening to hear about the warmth and love within your family, not to mention the inclusion of your Labrador. I'm an animal lover myself and plan to bring along my Siamese cat, Whiskers, who is well-behaved and quite the charmer. Given your current location in Rome and your commitment there, I appreciate your willingness to make accommodations for the rental process from afar. This shows a level of trust and openness that I find admirable and respect greatly. A bit about myself - my name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I am currently transitioning between jobs, which grants me the flexibility to move and settle before starting my new role in communications. The central location and amenities of the apartment are perfect for my lifestyle, especially the ease of access to local facilities and the inclusive utilities, which is a huge bonus. Before we move forward, I do have a few questions and clarification points: 1. Could we arrange for a virtual tour of the apartment? Given your availability constraints, perhaps a video walkthrough could be possible? 2. For the lease agreement, would you be able to send a draft for review? I’d like to go over the terms and perhaps have my lawyer glance at it to ensure everything is clear and acceptable. 3. Regarding the rental process from Rome, could you explain how we might handle the key exchange and initial move-in, considering your absence from Belgium? 4. Lastly, the pet policy was briefly mentioned. May I assume that my Siamese cat, Whiskers, would be welcome in the apartment? I am genuinely excited about the prospect of calling your apartment my new home and look forward to potentially finalizing the arrangements. Your international career sounds fascinating, and I hope we can find a convenient way to make the rental process smooth for both parties involved. Thank you again for considering my application, and I eagerly await your response. Enjoy your time in Rome, and please send my best wishes to your family – especially to the soon-to-be grandparents and, of course, the lucky Labrador.

text{IoU} + frac{rho^2(b, hat{b})}{c^2} + alpha cdot v ] 其中， - (text{IoU}) 是交集与并集之比 - (rho(b, hat{b})) 是预测框 (b) 和实际框 (hat{b}) 中心点的欧氏距离 - (c) 是封闭外接正方形的对角线长度 - (v) 调节长宽比的加权系数 - (alpha) 是权重系数，通常是一个关于长宽比的函数 由于在提供的代码中并没有看到涉及中心点距离和长宽比调节项的计算，因此我们可以说，尽管代码实现了GIoU损失的计算，但没有直接实现CIoU损失的计算。 如果你需要实现CIoU损失，你可以在\`generalized_box_iou\`函数的基础上，进一步添加计算中心点差距和长宽比调节项的代码。"},{"prompt":"你知道淄博烧烤吗？","completion":"淄博是中国山东省的一个城市，以其丰富的历史文化著称。淄博烧烤并不像四川烧烤、北京烤鸭那样全国闻名，但它仍然是当地流行的美食之一。淄博烧烤主要特色是味道鲜美、种类丰富，不仅有各种肉类，如羊肉串、牛肉串、猪肉串等，还有海鲜、蔬菜等多种选择，可以满足不同食客的口味。 淄博的烧烤方式多样，有的注重香辣味的调制，有的则偏重鲜香。通常，烧烤前会用秘制酱料腌制食材，使得成菜味道更加丰富。在淄博各大烧烤摊或是餐馆里，可以品尝到这些地道的风味。随着夜幕降临，街边烧烤摊营造出的热烈氛围，吸引着当地居民和游客前来享用美食，体验当地的夜生活文化。 尽管淄博烧烤可能还未形成一个全国性的品牌或标志，但它确实是淄博当地美食文化的重要组成部分，体现了山东人对美食的热情和追求。如果有机会访问淄博，品尝当地的烧烤绝对是一种不可错过的美味体验。"},{"prompt":"写一篇散文，1000字，内容是有关这个春天和夏天的情感的故事，表达一种孤独的无奈和惆怅，犹如李清照一般的文笔，又像是王爱玲一样的男女情长。","completion":"春天的气息，随着最后一场春雨悄然褪去，夏天用它炽热的手掌紧紧握住了时间的轮廓。那天，落日的余晖像极了染上霞光的羞涩，将我的窗前染成了一副温柔的画。我闭上眼，让心在这无垠的色彩中游走，思念如同被风吹起的花瓣，轻轻飘散。 如李清照笔下的《如梦令》一般，我多想“昨夜雨疏风骤”，让这份萦绕心头的孤寂有个归宿，让这份无法言说的惆怅，在雨中寻得解脱。春天的美，似乎总是带着些许无奈的忧愁，而夏天的热烈却无法覆盖内心深处的寂寞和冷清。 他在春天的尾巴匆匆离开，留下的只是一地未了的情长。那是一个无风的黄昏，他说，花开的季节总让人忍不住想要追逐些什么。我笑着，却不知道自己的心被隐隐撕扯。那时的我，仿佛置身于王爱玲笔下的情节，沉醉在这段无疾而终的情感里，不愿醒来。 夏日的夜晚，我孤单一人漫步在那条我们曾经并肩走过无数次的街道上。路灯下的影子拉得很长很长，就像我们曾经的故事，明明触手可及，却又仿佛遥不可及。夏夜的微风拂过脸颊，那是夏天特有的温度，既温暖又令人感到一丝丝凉意，就像他给的爱，炽热却又让人心生寂寥。 我多么希望，能有一个如同春天般温柔的怀抱，让我可以倚靠；有一个如同夏日午后雷阵雨般的热情，能将我的孤独彻底冲刷。但愿望总是美好，现实却是无情，我们都像是两条平行线，彼此靠近却永远不会相交。 终于，在一个闷热的夏夜，我写下了长长的一封信，倾诉着我的不舍和眷恋，却始终没有寄出。字里行间充满了对他的挂念，对过往时光的追忆，却也透露着一种释然和前行的勇气。就像王爱玲的文字，相爱却终将别离，深情却终究无处安放。 孤独和无奈，在这个悠长的夏日慢慢发酵，变成了一种淡淡的忧伤和惆怅。但我仍然相信，每一个季节的转换，每一场雨的洗礼，都是世界给予我们的疗愈。春去夏来，我们都在各自的路上前行，带着那份关于春天和夏天的故事，继续寻找属于自己的答案。 岁月流转，我终于明白，生活并不总是如诗如画，但那些关于春天的期许和夏天的热烈，将成为我心中永远的风景。无论未来的路有多么孤单，那份眷恋和惆怅，都将转化为我前行的力量。"},{"prompt":"岳阳楼记全文","completion":"《岳阳楼记》是北宋文学家范仲淹所作，是中国古代散文中的杰出作品之一，以其雄浑的气势、深沉的情感和鲜明的主题深受后世推崇。全文如下： 唐太宗李世民幸甲子，鸿胪寺臣僕射，谒者少卿吴建德奉诏赴岳州觐见。尝乘舆抵岳阳楼，北望洞庭，山水相形韵，朱颜翠发，挥毫遒丽，勒石题名。其书虽已灭，然笔意流赡，颇足观矣。建德既还，太宗问曰：“卿何所以兴感焉？”建德对曰：“臣诚以山川之出奇，岳阳之去国，宋、燕、萧、齐、何如之远也，而洞庭湖一夫占之，六百里襟带席卷者，非百城池之利害，千钧之重轻也， 抑且君臣相得，盛事斯在，四海升平，卷甲韬戈，引商刻羽，物阜民丰，岂诸侯、王室之有私哉？”太宗笑曰：“善哉！” 时苏轼为岳州推官，其年甲子也。予尝谓苏子瞻曰：“子所著《岳阳楼记》，老之篇也。江，天之渭也，洞庭，天之泽也。江泽之会，若夫昆仑、太华之峙也。其险也，若夫渭水之阻，岐山之滞也。而子由是兴乎乎焉，岂惟文章之藻翰欤？”子瞻笑而不答。予又尝谓子瞻曰：“子之《岳阳楼记》，固一时之佳作也；然则其所以为《岳阳楼记》而非他记者何也？”子瞻曰：“凡才之为用，皆历观成败之地，行取名迹之胜。上自台阁，下达壕井，岂独孤坟荒典，兹焉足观，盖有以也。岳阳楼之记守也，非若是而已矣。” 庆历四年春，余之扬子江上，梦涉大江，适岳州。二十余年矣，乃迷津途，不知所往，语之驿丞。驿丞曰：“此岳阳也。”余怡然自喜。问之又曰：“此岁何年？”答曰：“是庆历四年也。”余大异之。问其与予同船者，皆若与予昔者游之人。层城尽偻，钟磬并阕。问之又曰：“此之谓何？”对曰：“岳阳楼也。”舍矣，以中有白发翁，白衣贫士，自谓诗宗，相与游于榭亭台榭之间，便要与之马上。夕阳在山，人影参差，啸聚于斯。予谓众曰：“昔人已乘槎去矣，吾辈何时复此来遽？”众不应，又各一一为别。 余既觉，怅怅然若有所亡，或问：岳阳故人何在耶？曰：“先已矣！予独未矣。”凡所谓大块载我以形，挫我以境，诱我以物，骄我以朝，惰我以时，跼我以俗者，皆吾大故也。亦余心之所善兮，虽九死其犹未悔。故市井之徒，跂予而歌于涂，曾不知乎！夫夷由与义，未数歌而已矣。观夫海内之大，天地之宽，终不以兵革自相残，天之未丧斯文也。北山愚公之使志也，康乐之盛，樊溪之舟中人也，非世之忧民，一毫之薄赋也，和光同塵，限于今生者也。虽鞭之长，不及马腹，吾谁适从？悲夫！ 是以滕子京谏募之明，利剑之敏，贫贱之励据，宰相之忠诚，平生之报复，岂尝乎周公哉邵平之赆余，余有反哺之心；乐天知命不以富贵为福也。是故滕公以予为文学。明白四时之务，廓清天下之治；凛惧内外之讥，加餐阒寝，未尝知一夕之安。谓岳阳者，非独钓客之乐，达者为之，亦余心之所善兮，虽长江后浪推前浪，世事沧桑，变幻莫测，予尚游乎其中。是余故乡之情也，虽九死南荒，未悔志也。 范仲淹用此篇不仅展示出岳阳楼的壮美景色，还寄托了他对国家和民族未来的希望和梦想，体现了“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”的高尚情怀，被后世誉为“忧国忧民第一文”。"},{"prompt":"完全根据这篇文章的架构和写作手法，写一篇类似的文章，字数相同，古文架构","completion":"唐明皇李隆基春游承应亭，雅好文人，命左拾遗张九龄撰文以记其事。九龄才溢天下，文辞华美，一时传颂。尽管其文今不存，然其意蕴犹在，可谓有可观也。九龄归来，明皇问之曰：“何以见感于斯？”九龄对曰：“臣实感于天地之宽广，承应之地，位处京师，汉、唐、晋、宋、何如之盛也；而浩渺天地，一人独占，非金城池之固，千军之众也，抑且天人合一，盛世如斯，在乎天下为家，辞武从文，庠序兴学，民富国强，岂单于朝堂之私哉？”明皇笑曰：“言之善矣！” 时欧阳修为承天门史，其年癸卯也。余尝言于欧子修曰：“子之所著《承应亭记》，固士林之佳作也；江山如画，承应之地，宛若玉堂金马之境。其险也，若夫长江之隔，华山之绝也。而子于此兴有以，非惟文溯洄从也？”子修笑而不答。余又曰：“子之《承应亭记》，实一时之胜文；然其所以命《承应亭记》而非其他者何？”子修曰：“才之所施，由观前贤之地，纳览胜迹之归。自宫殿至于野亭，豈止幽人独往所堪，兹亦足观，盖有以也。承应亭记，非若蒙尘而已矣。” 庆祐三年春，余之适湖南，忽梦济巨川，至承应亭。三十余载矣，遽忘路岐，欲询于往人。往人曰：“此承应也。”余心自怡。复询曰：“今岁何纪？”答曰：“庆祐三年也。”余愕焉。问同梦者，每似旧知交也。古木参天，山色入扇。复问曰：“此为何地？”对曰：“承应亭也。”遂止，见有白发先生，朱衣书生，自名学海，与余共徜徉于亭栏阁道之中，不觉与之言笑。日暮山青，人语杂沓，聚语于斯。余谓众曰：“往者已登云路矣，我辈何时再此幽会耶？”众不答，纷纷各别。 余既醒，内心忧郁，若有所失。或问：“承应故侣安在哉？”曰：“已逝矣，惟余犹怀念。”凡大自然载我以形骸，抚我以风霜，引我以景致，放我以心志，怠我以时光，束我以世俗，皆我所不舍也。余之向往，虽千劫其犹怀旧。故市间小人，嘲余于道，岂知余心乎！夫真诈与美好，未几言而已绝。视天下之广，地乾坤之宽，终不以权势自相压，天道恒在。南山樵采之乐志也涣然忘忧，湖光山色之间，非时之动情，一缕洪恩，和光同尘，乐于今生者也。虽勇者无前，不足与天比，余将从何？ 此以杨亿贤臣勤王之志，锋利琼笔之才，贫贱之归隐，忠臣之节操，终身之忧乐，何足以为当世之望。曾子熊之至我，我有酬报之心；欧阳修以知命者不以世禄为念也。故杨公以余为文学之职，明了时令之宜，肃清宇内之治；畏忧边陲之诟，携笔从戎，鲜有宁夕。言承应亭，非独渔樵之乐，智者造之，亦余心之所善也，虽汹涌澎湃，世事如烟，流转不息，余尚游乎其间。此余故里之思，虽万死蛮荒，未改前志。"},{"prompt":"陆游的示儿全文","completion":"宋代诗人陆游的《示儿》原文如下： 钱塘江上清夜尽，笛声吹彻月明中。 一个是阆苑仙葩，一个是美玉无瑕。 若说没奇缘，今生偏又遇着他； 若说有奇缘，如何心事终虚化？ 世人笑我太疯癫，我笑世人看不穿。 不见满树春风里，那个不是个人间？ 这首诗词反映了陆游对人生、命运和爱情的独到感悟与哲思。通过与儿子的对话形式，表达了诗人在晚年时对人生虚无感的体悟以及对红尘中爱情美好但终究虚幻的感叹。陆游以自己的经历和感慨，告诫儿子要看透世事的本质，不被世俗所迷惑，更显得诗人豁达而超脱。同时，这首诗也彰显了陆游作为文学巨匠深沉的情感和精湛的诗词技艺。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The amount you earn is not directly linked to the number of views or reads but rather the engagement and reading time of Medium subscribers with your content. Here's a guide to understanding how you can earn money on Medium and what you might expect with 1000 views: # Eligibility for the Medium Partner Program - **Location:** You need to be in a country where Stripe payments are supported, as earnings are processed through Stripe. - **Medium Membership:** While you don't need to be a paying member of Medium to earn money, you do need to join the Medium Partner Program. # How Earnings are Calculated - **Engagement and Reading time:** Earnings are distributed from a portion of the membership fee based on the engagement and reading time of paying members on your stories. - **Internal vs. External Views:** Views from Medium members count towards your earnings, whereas views from non-members (external views) won’t directly contribute to your earnings. - **Quality and Relevance:** Higher quality content that engages readers to read till the end would naturally earn more, as engaged time is a key factor. # Earning with 1000 Views If you get 1000 views, the amount you earn can vary significantly and is not strictly determined by view count. Here's why: - **Member Engagement:** If those views are mostly from non-paying users or if readers don't spend much time on your article, your earnings might be lower. - **Membership Base:** The more Medium members engage with your content, the higher your potential earnings, assuming these views translate into meaningful reading time from paid members. While Medium does not disclose exact rates or formulas as they can fluctuate, writers have reported wide ranges in earnings — from just a few cents to several thousand dollars a month, reflecting the variability based on engagement, story length, subject matter, and the reading habits of Medium's paying audience. # Maximizing Earnings - **Consistency:** Regularly publish content to build an audience. - **Quality:** High-quality, engaging stories that retain reader attention will perform better. - **Niche Topics:** Writing in niches that interest readers can help attract a dedicated following. - **Promotion:** Share your stories on social media and with your own network to drive up engagement. # Conclusion The key to earning on Medium is not solely through achieving a high number of views but through creating content that resonates and engages Medium's paying members effectively. Therefore, focusing on the quality of engagement might be more beneficial than purely aiming for high view numbers."},{"prompt":"How I earn money as a beginner writer","completion":"Earning money as a beginner writer involves a combination of improving your craft, understanding the markets or platforms where you can earn, and effectively promoting your work. Below are strategies and steps you can take to start earning money as a beginner writer: # 1.

Строительные и демонтажные работы приводят к образованию значительных объемов отходов, которые включают в себя не только собственно строительный мусор, но и различные химические вещества, которые могут нанести вред окружающей среде. По данным различных исследований, строительные отходы составляют значимую часть от общего объема твердых бытовых отходов во многих странах. Эти отходы часто содержат бетон, кирпич, дерево, металл, пластик и другие материалы, которые могут быть использованы снова после соответствующей обработки. Однако на практике большая часть этих отходов либо захоранивается на свалках, либо подвергается неконтролируемому сжиганию, что приводит к серьезным последствиям для окружающей среды и здоровья человека. Одной из основных проблем в области утилизации строительных отходов является отсутствие четкой системы сбора, разделения и переработки этих материалов. Многие страны до сих пор не имеют специализированных технологий и оборудования для эффективной обработки строительного мусора, что приводит к его скоплению и вредным последствиям для окружающей среды. Для решения этой проблемы требуются комплексные меры, включающие в себя разработку и внедрение новых технологий переработки строительных отходов, установление строгих нормативов по управлению и утилизации этих отходов, а также развитие инфраструктуры для их сбора и переработки. Кроме того, важным аспектом является развитие культуры переработки и повторного использования строительных материалов среди компаний и населения. Примеры успешной практики показывают, что современные технологии могут существенно увеличить уровень переработки строительных отходов. Так, в некоторых странах внедрены технологии дробления бетона и кирпича для последующего использования в качестве заполнителя в строительстве новых дорог или производства нового бетона. Такие меры не только способствуют снижению объемов отходов, но и позволяют сэкономить на природных ресурсах. Важную роль в решении проблемы накопления, переработки и утилизации строительных отходов играет государственная политика и международное сотрудничество. Создание законодательной базы, регулирующей обращение с строительными отходами, введение экономических стимулов для компаний, занимающихся переработкой, и обмен опытом на международном уровне могут существенно улучшить ситуацию. В заключение, можно сказать, что проблема накопления, переработки и утилизации строительных отходов требует незамедлительного решения. Это не только поможет снизить негативное воздействие на окружающую среду и улучшить состояние здоровья населения, но и откроет новые возможности для снижения стоимости строительства и развития экономики в целом. Развитие технологий переработки, создание соответствующей инфраструктуры и осознание важности вопроса как на уровне государства, так и на уровне отдельных компаний и граждан сыграют ключевую роль в решении этой глобальной проблемы."},{"prompt":"تطور كرة القدم في العالم العربي: من الأصول التاريخية إلى المستقبل المشرق\\"","completion":"كرة القدم في العالم العربي لها تاريخ غني ومتنوع يمتد لأكثر من قرن من الزمان. بدأت ممارسة كرة القدم في العديد من البلدان العربية أثناء الفترة الاستعمارية، حيث قدمتها الجيوش والمعلمين والطلبة المحليين الذين عادوا من الدراسة في أوروبا. منذ ذلك الحين، نمت شعبية كرة القدم بشكل كبير، وأصبحت الرياضة الأكثر شعبية في المنطقة. # الأصول التاريخية في القرن العشرين، بدأت دول مثل مصر والمغرب وتونس في تشكيل فرق وأندية كرة قدم محلية. مصر، على سبيل المثال، تعتبر واحدة من أولى الدول العربية التي شهدت تأسيس أندية كرة القدم، مع تأسيس النادي الأهلي في القاهرة عام 1907 والزمالك في عام 1911. في السنوات التالية، شهدت الدول الأخرى إنشاء أنديتها الخاصة وبدأت بطولات كرة القدم المحلية تظهر تدريجياً. # نمو الرياضة وانتشارها خلال العقود التالية، شهدت كرة القدم نمواً غير مسبوق في العالم العربي، مع زيادة الاهتمام باللعبة على المستوى الشعبي والاستثمار في البنية التحتية الرياضية. البطولات الوطنية أصبحت أكثر تنظيماً وانتظاماً، وبدأ اللاعبين العرب بالظهور على الساحة الدولية. الأندية العربية شاركت في بطولات قارية ودولية، مما زاد من شهرة الأندية واللاعبين العرب. # التحديات والإنجازات على الرغم من التطور الكبير، واجهت كرة القدم في العالم العربي العديد من التحديات مثل الأزمات السياسية والاقتصادية التي أثرت على تطور الرياضة في بعض الدول. ومع ذلك، شهد العقد الأخير تحسناً ملحوظاً في البنية التحتية الرياضية، وزيادة في الاستثمارات في الأندية، وتطوير برامج للشباب، مما ساهم في تحقيق إنجازات على الصعيد الدولي. # المستقبل المشرق المستقبل يبدو مشرقاً لكرة القدم في العالم العربي. الدول العربية مثل قطر، التي استضافت كأس العالم فيفا 2022، أظهرت القدرة على تنظيم الأحداث الرياضية الكبرى، مما يعزز مكانتها على الساحة الدولية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، اللاعبين العرب يحققون النجاح في الدوريات الأوروبية الكبرى مما يزيد من الاهتمام بكرة القدم في المنطقة. مع استمرار الاستثمار في الشباب والبنية التحتية، والاهتمام المتزايد من الجمهور، يمكن أن تستمر كرة القدم في العالم العربي في النمو والتطور. الجيل القادم من اللاعبين قد يجد فرصاً أكثر من أي وقت مضى لتطوير مهاراتهم والمنافسة على أعلى المستويات الدولية."},{"prompt":"Read the sentences and rewrite them using to be able to.

Bu, özellikle on binlerce yorumun bulunduğu videolar için geçerlidir. Platform, sadece belirli sayıda yorumu gösterir ve genellikle en alakalı veya en yeni yorumları önce yükler. Kullanıcı, sayfayı aşağı kaydırdıkça daha fazla yorum yavaş yavaş yüklenir, ancak bu süreç tüm yorumların görüntülenmesini garanti etmez. 2. **Yorum Filtreleme ve Moderasyon:** Video sahibi veya YouTube'un kendisi, spam, uygunsuz içerik veya toksik yorumları filtrelemek için otomatik araçlar ve moderasyon kuralları kullanabilir. Bu nedenle bazı yorumlar gizlenebilir veya silinebilir. 3. **Yorumların Sıklığı ve Zamanlaması:** Bir videoya yapılan yorumlar çok hızlı bir şekilde artıyorsa, bu, YouTube'un tüm yorumları aynı anda işleyip gösterme kapasitesini aşabilir. Bu durumda, platform en uygun gördüğü bir seçkiyi göstermeyi tercih edebilir. 4. **Teknik Sorunlar veya Hatalar:** YouTube'un kendi sunucularında veya tarayıcınızda oluşan geçici bir sorun da yorumların tamamının gösterilmemesine neden olabilir. Bu tür durumlar, genellikle YouTube tarafından kısa sürede çözülür ancak kullanıcıların karşılaştığı problemler geçici olarak devam edebilir. Eğer tüm yorumları görmek istiyorsanız, sayfayı yenilemek veya tarayıcınızın önbelleğini temizlemek gibi temel sorun giderme adımlarını deneyebilirsiniz.

The admission was made in court documents for the first time since rolling out of the vaccine. The pharmaceutical company, which developed the vaccine in partnership with the University of Oxford, is facing a class-action lawsuit alleging that their vaccine has resulted in fatalities and serious injuries among recipients. Jamie Scott, a father of two, had filed a lawsuit last year after he developed a blood clot rendering him unable to work, The Telegraph report said. He had reportedly suffered a permanent brain injury after receiving the vaccine in April 2021. According to the report, fifty-one cases have been lodged in the High Court, with victims and grieving relatives seeking damages estimated to be worth up to £100 million. The company had in May 2023 told Scott's lawyers that they do not accept that TTS is caused by the vaccine at a generic level\\". However, in the legal document submitted to the High Court in February, AstraZeneca said,\\" “It is admitted that the AZ vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause TTS. The causal mechanism is not known.\\" Speaking to The Telegraph Scott’s wife Kate said, “The medical world has acknowledged for a long time that vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) was caused by the vaccine.\\" Stating that it has taken three years for the admission, Kate has demanded an apology, fair compensation for their family and other families who have been affected. \\"We have the truth on our side, and we are not going to give up.\\" AstraZeneca had also partnered with Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, for the supply of the vaccine to the Indian Government.

Это признание было сделано в судебных документах, которые стали доступны впервые после начала использования вакцины. Этот факт был обнародован в докладе, опубликованном лондонской газетой The Telegraph. Вакцина, разработанная в сотрудничестве с Университетом Оксфорда, стала предметом коллективного иска, в котором утверждается, что ее использование привело к смертельным случаям и серьезным травмам среди тех, кто ею воспользовался. Джейми Скотт, отец двоих детей, подал иск в прошлом году после того, как после прививки у него развился кровяной сгусток, из-за чего он не смог продолжить работу. По информации из доклада The Telegraph, в результате вакцинации в апреле 2021 года он получил постоянное повреждение мозга. Согласно тому же докладу, 51 случай уже был представлен в Высокий суд, где пострадавшие и оплакивающие родственники требуют компенсаций, общая сумма которых может достигать £100 миллионов. Компания AstraZeneca в мае 2023 года сообщила адвокатам Скотта, что не признает TTS в качестве побочного эффекта вакцины на \\"общем уровне\\". Однако в юридических документах, представленных в Высокий суд в феврале, компания признала: \\"Признаётся, что вакцина AZ действительно может вызвать TTS в очень редких случаях. Механизм возникновения данного состояния пока неизвестен.\\" Кейт, жена Скотта, рассказывая об этом The Telegraph, отметила, что \\"медицинское сообщество давно признало, что иммунотромбоцитопения и тромбоз, вызванные вакциной (VITT), действительно связаны с прививкой\\". Учитывая, что на признание потребовалось три года, Кейт требует извинений и справедливой компенсации как для своей семьи, так и для других пострадавших семей. \\"Мы знаем правду, и мы не собираемся отступать.\\" AstraZeneca также сотрудничала с Serum Institute of India (SII), крупнейшим в мире производителем вакцин, чтобы обеспечить поставку вакцины правительству Индии."},{"prompt":"What are those \\"meshtastic\\" comms devices that have become more popular recently?","completion":"Meshtastic is an open-source project developed with the aim to create an affordable, easy-to-use, and long-range mesh networking communication system. It is especially designed for outdoor and off-grid activities, including hiking, skiing, camping, and any scenario where traditional cellular network coverage is unavailable or unreliable. The project has gained popularity among outdoor enthusiasts, emergency preppers, and in various community networking contexts for several reasons: 1. **Open Source**: Being an open-source project, Meshtastic allows developers and users to contribute to its development, which ensures continuous improvement and innovation. 2. **Long Range Communication**: Utilizing LoRa (Long Range) radio technology, Meshtastic devices can achieve significantly longer communication distances compared to standard Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices, often several kilometers in open terrain, depending on conditions. 3. **Low Power Consumption**: The devices are designed for low power consumption, enabling them to run for days or even weeks on a single battery charge, which is crucial for outdoor and remote applications. 4. **Mesh Networking**: Meshtastic devices automatically create a mesh network, where each device can act as a relay for others. This increases the effective range and reliability of the network because messages can hop through multiple devices to reach their destination. 5. **Versatility**: The platform supports various messages, including text and GPS location data, making it useful for both communication and navigation. 6. **Privacy and Security**: Communications can be encrypted, providing a level of privacy and security for users. 7. **Wide Range of Devices**: Meshtastic software can run on a variety of low-cost devices.

Meshtastic is suitable for anyone looking for a reliable, cost-effective communication tool where conventional networks are absent or unreliable. Whether for personal use in outdoor activities, coordination in community events, or even for basic communication in remote areas without infrastructure, Meshtastic offers a compelling solution."},{"prompt":"Is it possible or likely that all the encrypted data being sent on the meshtastic network is being collected now so as to be decrypted at some point in the future?","completion":"The possibility of encrypted data being collected now with the intention of decrypting it in the future touches on a broader concept known as \\"harvest now, decrypt later\\" (HNDL). This concept applies to any encrypted communication, not just Meshtastic, and is predicated on the assumption that what cannot be decrypted today might become decryptable in the future as computational power increases, especially with advancements in quantum computing. Regarding Meshtastic specifically: 1. **Encryption**: Meshtastic uses encryption to secure the communication between devices. This means that even if someone were to intercept the communications, deciphering the content without the encryption key would be challenging using current technology. 2. **Future Threats**: While the encryption used by Meshtastic (or any other system) provides a strong level of security against unauthorized access today, it is theoretically possible that future advancements in computing, including quantum computing, could render today’s encryption vulnerable to decryption. Quantum computers, for example, promise significant computational power that could potentially break many of the encryption algorithms currently considered secure. 3. **Data Collection Feasibility**: The decentralized and distributed nature of Meshtastic's mesh network makes the systematic collection of all encrypted data more challenging compared to centralized communication systems. An adversary would need to have widespread physical presence to intercept a significant portion of the communications. 4. **Practical Considerations**: The practical value of collecting Meshtastic encrypted data now for future decryption is debatable. Much of the communication might be mundane or time-sensitive, losing its relevance by the time decryption becomes feasible. However, from a privacy and security perspective, it's wise to assume that any highly sensitive information could be at risk in the long term and to consider the potential consequences of future decryption capabilities. 5. **Mitigating Risks**: To mitigate future risks, ongoing evaluation and upgrades of encryption algorithms are necessary. As threats evolve, so too must the security measures protecting against them. The Meshtastic project and other similar technologies would need to adapt by adopting post-quantum cryptography algorithms as they become practical and necessary. In summary, while it's technically possible for encrypted Meshtastic communications to be collected now in hopes of future decryption, the practicality and value of such an endeavor would largely depend on the nature of the data being transmitted and the advancements in decryption technologies. Users concerned about long-term confidentiality should stay informed about advancements in encryption and cybersecurity to protect their communications adequately."},{"prompt":"Is it theoeretically possible to have small, nano-scale antennae distributed across populated areas in order to collect encrypted meashtastic data?","completion":"The idea of deploying small, nano-scale antennas to collect encrypted Meshtastic data across populated areas is theoretically plausible within the context of ongoing advancements in nanotechnology and wireless communication. However, the practical implementation of such a concept would face a number of significant challenges and considerations: # Technological Feasibility 1. **Nano-scale Antennas**: While nano-antennas (or optical antennas) exist, their application has primarily centered on research involving light manipulation at the nanoscale, rather than the typical radio frequencies used by systems like Meshtastic. Adapting these technologies for widespread data collection in urban environments would require significant advancements. 2. **Power and Processing**: Beyond the antenna itself, a complete system for capturing and processing data would be necessary. This includes not only receiving the signal but also storing or forwarding the data for later analysis. Considering the energy and processing requirements, creating a nano-scale device that could autonomously perform these tasks remains a significant challenge with current technology. # Deployment and Coverage 3. **Widespread Coverage**: To effectively collect data from a mesh network like Meshtastic, a large number of these nano-scale devices would need to be deployed across a wide area. This is because Meshtastic devices can communicate over kilometers in open environments, meaning data interception efforts would need to be extensive to ensure comprehensive coverage. 4. **Physical and Environmental Limitations**: Deploying such devices in an urban environment would also involve overcoming physical barriers and interference from buildings, natural terrain, and human-made structures, which can drastically affect the quality and reach of wireless signals. # Legal and Ethical Implications 5. **Privacy Concerns**: The deployment of surveillance technology, especially of this covert and pervasive nature, raises significant privacy and ethical concerns. It's likely to be regulated or restricted in many jurisdictions, making such an endeavor not only technically challenging but also legally complex. 6. **Security**: The very premise of collecting encrypted communications presumes an intent to decrypt or analyze these communications at some point. Such actions could be perceived as hostile or invasive, impacting individual privacy rights and potentially conflicting with laws designed to protect communication privacy. # Conclusion While theoretically possible, the deployment of nano-scale antennas to collect encrypted messages from networks like Meshtastic faces considerable hurdles in terms of current technological capabilities, deployment logistics, and legal/ethical considerations. Advances in quantum computing, nanotechnology, and energy harvesting could alter this landscape in the future, making previously theoretical concepts more achievable. However, for now, the widespread collection of encrypted data via nano-scale devices remains more science fiction than practical reality."},{"prompt":"根据下面的问题描述，整理总结问题： 第 1 个问题: 1.步骤及结果： 用户信息 ： 赵彦军13693365463 QQ1220975536 2.实际结果：标段功能无法使用 3.期望结果：升级后可正常使用 用户标段功能用的很深，已影响后续工作需要远程支持 第 2 个问题: 1.步骤及结果：选中已绘制的管线 2. 修改构件的“名称”属性 2.实际结果：导管材质的属性刷新错误（初步判断为bug，需分析） 3.期望结果： 同原有实现，修改名称属性，反建构件之后，管道材质属性不变。 问题来源： 第 3 个问题: 问题：用户在6深度处理车间里面布置了3AN7-WC06.31这个回路，发现电缆沟内的电缆端头个数计算多了，帮用户检查电缆沟的那个地方是没有任何设备和配电箱的，在别的单项里面也是没有任何设备和配电箱的，用户别的回路经过这里也会多预留端头，用户想知道原因，麻烦看一下 QQ:747335561 手机号：17394947281 远程：512155276 操作步骤：目前只有这个箱子的回路有问题，删除重新配线也不行，需要查原因，麻烦看看 实际结果：线缆端头个数计算不对，计算多了 期望结果：查找原因，计算准确","completion":"总结问题如下： 1. 标段功能无法使用，期望升级后可正常使用 2. 修改管线构件属性后，导管材质属性刷新错误，需分析是否为bug 3. 电缆沟内电缆端头计算多了，需要查找原因并解决。"},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

I vettori di supporto, nell'ambito degli algoritmi delle macchine a vettori di supporto (SVM, Support Vector Machines), sono fondamentali per determinare l'iperpiano separatore. L'iperpiano separatore è la decision boundary (o superficie decisionale) che massimizza la distanza (margine) tra le classi di dati nel feature space. I vettori di supporto sono i punti dati più vicini all'iperpiano separatore, e l'ottimizzazione durante l'allenamento dell'SVM si concentra su questi punti, ignorando i punti che sono più lontani. Pertanto, sono proprio questi vettori di supporto a determinare la posizione e l'orientamento dell'iperpiano separatore, rendendo vera l'affermazione."},{"prompt":"I vettori di supporto determinano il margine. vero o falso?","completion":"Vero. Nei modelli di macchine a vettori di supporto (SVM, Support Vector Machines), i vettori di supporto sono effettivamente quelli che determinano il margine. Il margine è definito come la distanza tra l'iperpiano separatore e il vettore di supporto più vicino ad esso. In pratica, l'SVM cerca di massimizzare questo margine per migliorare la capacità del modello di generalizzare bene su dati non visti, cioè per ridurre il rischio di overfitting. I vettori di supporto sono quindi i punti dati più vicini all'iperpiano separatore, e sono questi punti che \\"sostengono\\" l'iperpiano nella sua posizione ottimale, da cui il nome \\"vettori di supporto\\". La larghezza del margine è direttamente determinata dalla distanza tra questi vettori di supporto e l'iperpiano. Dunque, modificando la posizione dei vettori di supporto o aggiungendone di nuovi può alterare sia l'iperpiano separatore sia il margine.

Questo per diversi motivi: 1. **Overfitting o Underfitting:** Un rapporto dell'accuracy tra training e validation set potrebbe non fornire informazioni chiare sull'overfitting o sull'underfitting del modello. Un modello potrebbe avere un'accuracy molto elevata sul training set (indicando potenziale overfitting) e relativamente bassa sul validation set. Un semplice rapporto potrebbe non riflettere adeguatamente questo squilibrio. 2. **Comprensibilità:** Un singolo numero derivante da questo rapporto potrebbe non essere intuitivo o direttamente utile per valutare la performance del modello. Ad esempio, un rapporto vicino a 1 potrebbe indicare che un modello si comporta simile sia sul training che sul validation set, ma non dice nulla sulla bontà assoluta di tale comportamento (potrebbe essere un'accuracy globalmente bassa, indicativa di underfitting). 3. **Mancanza di contesto:** L'accuracy, seppur utile, non è l'unica metrica per valutare le performance di un modello. In alcuni contesti, altre metriche come precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, possono fornire una valutazione più completa. Concentrarsi esclusivamente sul rapporto dell'accuracy potrebbe trascurare aspetti importanti della performance del modello. 4. **Selezione basata su una metrica bilanciata:** Piuttosto che concentrarsi su un rapporto di accuracy, è generalmente più utile confrontare le metriche di performance separatamente o utilizzare tecniche di validazione incrociata che forniscono una stima più affidabile della performance del modello su diversi sottoinsiemi dei dati. 5. **Prevenzione dell'overfitting:** Metodi come l'early stopping (durante l'addestramento di modelli neurali, ad esempio) o la regolarizzazione sono approcci diretti per controllare l'overfitting, anziché affidarsi a indicatori indiretti come il rapporto tra le accuracy. In conclusione, sebbene confrontare l'accuracy tra i set di training e validation sia utile per identificare l'overfitting, fare affidamento su un semplice rapporto tra queste per la selezione del modello è generalmente considerato eccessivamente riduttivo e potenzialmente fuorviante. È preferibile utilizzare una combinazione di metriche di performance insieme a tecniche di validazione incrociata per prendere decisioni informate sulla selezione del modello."},{"prompt":"hello, can you please fix my motivational letter?","completion":"Of course, I'd be happy to help with your motivational letter! Please share the text of your letter, and I'll assist with corrections, improvements, and suggestions."},{"prompt":"To: Brandenburg Technical University - School of Architecture | Admissions Office Greetings, With this letter, I hereby wish to state my interest and apply for a Master’s degree program in the International MSc program in the Urban design – Revitalization of historic city districts. I have been always interested in architecture, especially the architecture of heritage buildings. Therefore, it is not surprising that I have finished my Bachelor in Architectural Engineering with a 72.95% degree. I have developed a strong passion for noticing the elegance of the old structures and the sense of urban spaces and their relations with the context. As I have an interest in art and culture. I started to sketch heritage buildings when I was 10. I found sketching as a method of storytelling during my college years. Through re-sketching the scenes, I was communicating with the environment where I belong. The study of fundamental architectural courses, such as Theories of architecture and urban planning, helped me to realize that the architectural innovation of particular geography depends on the history and the heritage of that particular culture. The study of fundamental architectural courses, such as Theories of architecture and urban planning, made me realize that the architectural innovation of a particular geography depends on the history and heritage of that particular culture. I have faced urban planning challenges in terms of their sustainability during my 2 years of professional practice, and the deals that we had with clients taught me to put more flesh on the bones. Considering my experiences and my interests in the images of towns, I have decided that Urban design is the field in which I want to expand my horizon with. The rise of demands for housing alongside the limited time given; has obliged changes in the urban fabric of the cities and their infrastructure. These changes should be organized in a way that should not have any impact on the mental images of the locals and the historic urban fabric that is mostly based in the center of these cities, especially in MENA regions. For this purpose, we need experts in the planning committee of our governments with more suitable solutions. I truly believe that my country needs to upgrade its current heritage conservation manners and urban infrastructure in the historical districts within the cities. There should be policies to stop the destruction of the historic houses in the CBD to be turned into parking lots or commercial buildings. as well as traffic and sewerage problems within these historical districts that sometimes turn the tourists away rather than gathering them. Studies have provided me with a deeper understanding of heritage and its cultural influences. Hence, my motto has been this line from The eyes of the skin by Juhanni Pallasma: “Memory takes us back to distant cities, and novels transport us through cities invoked by the magic of the writer’s word. The rooms, squares, and streets of a great writer are as vivid as many that we had visited.” The joint influence of my artistic skills and knowledge helped me to visualize these heritage cores located in the city centers with infrastructure solutions that will solve major traffic problems within the CBD and provide economic relief in terms of tourism development, as well as introduce the identity of these heritage sites to the locals. One of the main professional achievements I would like to point out is my involvement in the “Research-based Housing Project for Internally displaced families in Iraq in partnership with the International Organization for Migration” where the first phase of the project was a long research and on-site questionnaire session to understand the physical and social needs of the user families considering their culture; in terms of space distribution, privacy, as well as the vernacular architectural traces and elements that were used in their home towns. And re-create their mental images and protect their identity. I have been involved in this project since 2021 a year after my graduation. Thanks to this experience and a number of likewise experiences that I have faced in my professional practice I have gained practical skills in Urban planning and interaction with heritage studies and the importance of these studies. After these interactions, I have realized that I need to improvise my practices in terms of professional knowledge and experiences provided by experts in higher studies. Mesopotamia region that has been known as the cradle of civilization has a vast number of essential heritage sites and urban centers, though a number of them still remain undiscovered. This potential needs to be considered by the decision-making parties to richen up the national and international heritage, introducing these potentials to people and bringing these evidence of timeline, at the same time. When I saw the course titles and the modules I was impressed, as “New architecture in historic context” is basically one of the topics I have been interested in reading for the past few years and I can not wait to take this and other modules in the course, academically in Alexandria. It will be an amazing opportunity to study these curriculums at Brandenburg Technical University and the two partner universities; Alexandria University and Cairo University, traveling back in time in each of these cities. I felt that I have not satisfied my urge to learn, especially when there is much more to see and experience. I do not perceive a Graduate Degree as an end. I have a strong desire to push ahead, and I plan to invest a lot in my education to build my career. To fully utilize my time spent in graduate school, I now require a program that can provide me with the best resources, and the best educational tools available. Your university can rightly provide me with those. Considering the Dual degree in these prestigious universities. I see this program as a gateway to my goals.

They do discuss various aspects of yoga, meditation, and spiritual energy. However, the concept of Kundalini, as it is understood within the tantric or yogic traditions later on, is not directly mentioned or detailed in the same way in the earliest Upanishads or the Vedas. Kundalini is often described as a dormant spiritual energy located at the base of the spine. When awakened, this energy is believed to travel up through the chakras (energy centers) leading to various states of enlightenment and spiritual realization. This specific terminology and detailed conceptual framework around Kundalini are more elaborately found in later texts related to Tantra and Yoga, such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Yoga Kundalini Upanishad, which, despite its name, is considered a minor Upanishad and is a much later addition to the body of texts, reflecting the development of ideas around Kundalini energy in later centuries. That said, there are concepts and discussions in the Upanishads and even the Vedas that can be seen as precursors to or in alignment with the ideas later detailed in the context of Kundalini Yoga. For instance, the Chandogya Upanishad and others discuss subtle bodies, channels (nadis), and vital energies (pranas) that bear resemblance to the concepts foundational to understanding Kundalini. The Svetasvatara Upanishad, one of the later Upanishads, has references that are often interpreted by scholars and practitioners as alluding to the ascent of spiritual energy through the spine, which can be associated with later Kundalini practices. Therefore, while the Vedas and the earliest Upanishads may not explicitly describe Kundalini in the terms or detail found in later tantric or yogic texts, they lay the groundwork for many of the spiritual concepts and practices that would be further elaborated into the Kundalini system seen in some schools of Hinduism and spirituality."},{"prompt":"What is the Kashmir Shaivism perspective on kundalini?","completion":"Kashmir Shaivism, a non-dualistic tradition within Hinduism that flourished in Kashmir, India, and focuses on the recognition of the Self (atman) as identical with the ultimate reality (Shiva), offers a sophisticated and detailed perspective on Kundalini. It integrates the concept of Kundalini energy not merely as a yogic or bodily phenomenon but as a fundamental aspect of spiritual awakening and realization within its philosophical framework. In Kashmir Shaivism, Kundalini is described as a cosmic energy (Shakti) that resides in latent form at the base of the spine in every individual. This spiritual energy is often symbolized as a coiled serpent (hence the term \\"kundalini,\\" which comes from the Sanskrit word \\"kundala,\\" meaning \\"coiled\\"). The awakening of Kundalini and her ascent through the central channel (sushumna) to the crown (sahasrara) is considered essential for spiritual liberation (moksha). Key concepts of Kashmir Shaivism related to Kundalini include: 1. **Shakti as Consciousness**: Kashmir Shaivism posits that the entire universe is a manifestation of Shiva's energy or Shakti, which is also Kundalini. This energy, when awakened, is the dynamic aspect of consciousness that leads to self-recognition or the realization of one's unity with Shiva. 2. **Spanda and Vibhuti**: Spanda refers to the divine pulsation or throb of Shiva's energy, symbolizing the dynamic nature of the universe. Kundalini, in her movement, is an expression of this divine pulsation, leading to the unfoldment of spiritual powers (vibhuti) and higher states of consciousness. 3. **Shaktipat**: A distinctive feature of many paths within Kashmir Shaivism is the transmission of spiritual energy (Shaktipat) from a master to a disciple. This transfer can awaken the disciple's Kundalini, facilitating a more direct experience of spiritual truths and accelerating the path to liberation. 4. **Meditation and Practices**: Various meditation techniques and practices are prescribed within Kashmir Shaivism to facilitate the awakening and ascent of Kundalini. These include specific mantra recitations, visualization techniques, and breathing exercises designed to purify the body and mind, balance the energies, and enable the smooth rise of Kundalini through the chakras. 5. **The Role of the Guru**: The guidance of a realized master or guru is considered crucial in Kashmir Shaivism for safely awakening and guiding Kundalini's energy. The guru not only initiates the awakening through Shaktipat but also helps navigate the transformative and sometimes challenging experiences and energies that can arise. In conclusion, in the Kashmir Shaivism tradition, Kundalini is not just a personal energy or experience but a cosmic principle integral to the process of spiritual awakening. It represents the unfoldment of consciousness itself, leading the practitioner from individuality to the ultimate realization of their inherent oneness with Shiva."},{"prompt":"give me critical anaysis on nursing incident , acc to gibbs","completion":"Gibbs' reflective cycle is a commonly used model for reflection and critical analysis in nursing incidents.

Selenium is designed for automating web browsers to mimic real user actions as closely as possible. Since modern browsers do not typically allow users to change system headers like \\"Accept-Encoding\\" directly through the browser interface, Selenium does not offer a direct method to alter these headers. However, for testing purposes, if changing the \\"Accept-Encoding\\" header is crucial for your use case, you might need to use a workaround. One common approach is to use a proxy server that modifies the HTTP request headers between your Selenium-driven browser and the web servers. Here's an example of how you could achieve this using the BrowserMob Proxy, a popular choice due to its ease of use and integration with Selenium: # Step 1: Download BrowserMob Proxy Download and start BrowserMob Proxy. It's available here: https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy. # Step 2: Set up your Selenium script to use the proxy Here's a basic example using Python Selenium with BrowserMob Proxy to modify the \\"Accept-Encoding\\" request header: \`\`\`python from browsermobproxy import Server from selenium import webdriver # Path to where you've extracted your BrowserMob Proxy BMP_PATH = '/path/to/browsermob-proxy' # Starting the BrowserMob Proxy server server = Server(BMP_PATH + '/bin/browsermob-proxy') server.start() proxy = server.create_proxy() # Setting up Selenium to use the proxy profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile() selenium_proxy = proxy.selenium_proxy() profile.set_proxy(selenium_proxy) driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile) # Creating a custom request interceptor to modify the Accept-Encoding header request_interceptor = \\"\\"\\" var headers = request.headers(); headers['Accept-Encoding'] = 'your-desired-encoding'; request.headers(headers); \\"\\"\\" proxy.request_interceptor = request_interceptor # Access your webpage driver.get(\\"http://yourwebsite.com\\") # Clean up driver.quit() server.stop() \`\`\` Replace \`/path/to/browsermob-proxy\` with the actual path where you've extracted BrowserMob Proxy. Also, don't forget to update \`'your-desired-encoding'\` to the encoding you wish to use in the request. **Note:** BrowserMob Proxy can intercept and modify the HTTP requests and responses. Using it introduces an additional component into your testing setup, which can complicate things. Ensure that your testing environment is secure, especially if you're manipulating headers or dealing with sensitive data. Since BrowserMob Proxy and similar tools work by effectively man-in-the-middling the network communication, their use might not be suitable for all testing environments, particularly in production or with sensitive data without appropriate security considerations."},{"prompt":"write me a chapter for a book. use the subject of Fostering a Positive Mindset. use 3500. do not repeat one word more than twice. use these descriptions to assist with this chapter.
