Therefore, in 4 days, part ( mathrm{A} ) grows 4 units of grass. - Let the initial amount of grass in part ( mathrm{A} ) be ( 4 ) units. - The herd eats part ( mathrm{A} ) (4 units) completely in 7 days. 3. **Calculating the Eating Rate:** - The total amount of grass consumed by the herd in 7 days on part ( mathrm{A} ) is the initial 4 units plus the additional grass grown over 7 days. - The amount eaten in 7 days is ( 4 + 7 times 1 = 11 ) units (since the growth rate is 1 unit per day). - Therefore, the eating rate of the herd is ( frac{11}{7} ) units per day. 4. **Grass on Part ( mathrm{B} ):** - The herd eats on part ( mathrm{B} ) for 4 days. - The total grass consumed in 4 days on part ( mathrm{B} ) is ( frac{11}{7} times 4 = frac{44}{7} ) units. 5. **Growth Rate and Initial Amount in Part ( mathrm{B} ):** - Let the growth rate of grass in part ( mathrm{B} ) be ( x ) units per day. - Let the initial amount of grass in part ( mathrm{B} ) be ( 4x ) units. - The total amount of grass consumed should account for both the initial amount and the grass grown in 4 days plus the regrowth period of 7 days (total of 11 days of growth). 6. **Setting Up the Equation:** - Total amount of grass in part ( mathrm{B} ) after 11 days of growth is ( 4x + 11x = 15x ). - We know from above that this total grass amount is ( frac{44}{7} ) units. Therefore, we have: [ 15x = frac{44}{7} ] 7. **Solving for ( x ):** [ x = frac{44}{105} ] 8. **Determining the Ratio of Areas:** - The growth rate of grass is proportional to the area of the grassland since a larger area would yield more grass. - Therefore, the area ratio ( A : B ) is the reciprocal of the growth rate ratio. - Since the growth rates are 1 unit/day for ( A ) and ( frac{44}{105} ) units/day for ( B ), the area ratio is: [ 1 : frac{44}{105} = 105 : 44 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{105:44} ]"},{"prompt":"Tom's fruit bowl contains 3 oranges and some lemons.

We aim to prove the existence of two disjoint sets ( A ) and ( B ) of 477 harbours each, such that there are no direct ferry connections between any harbour in ( A ) and any harbour in ( B ). 1. **Initial Setup**: - Let ( V ) be the set of all 2016 harbours. 2. **Defining the problem within subgroups**: - For any harbour ( C_1 in V ), let ( U = V setminus {C_1} ) and initially set ( W = emptyset ). 3. **Construction of sequences**: - Starting from ( C_1 ), consider extending a route ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k ) such that all ( C_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq k )) are distinct harbours connected via direct routes. 4. **Limitation of the sequence**: - Given that it’s impossible to form a sequence of direct voyages ( C_1 - C_2 - cdots - C_{1062} ) with all distinct harbours, the maximum length ( k ) of the sequence ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k ) is ( k leq 1061 ). This means there must be at least ( 2016 - 1061 = 955 ) other harbours in ( V ) that we have not considered in the sequence. 5. **Categorizing harbours**: - Move ( C_k ) from ( U ) to ( W ), and attempt to continue the sequence by starting from ( C_{k-1} ) and so on, always removing the last harbour in the sequence to ( W ) if no further extension is possible. 6. **Iterative Process**: - Repeat the process: if a harbor cannot extend the sequence, it is moved to ( W ). If no connection exists from ( C_1 ) to any other harbour, move ( C_1 ) to ( W ) and start from another harbour not in ( W ). This process creates two sets ( U ) and ( W ), where no direct connections exist between harbours in these sets. 7. **Ensuring equal partition**: - The iterative reduction ensures that the size of ( U ) gradually decreases by 1 each time a harbour is moved to ( W ), while the size of ( W ) increases by 1. - Given the constraint on the sequence size, it will eventually be possible to divide ( V ) such that ( |U| = 2016 - |W| ) and ensure that ( |U| + |W| = 2016 ). During this process, by the pigeonhole principle, the situation will arise where each set has at least ( frac{2016 - 1062}{2} = 477 ) harbours. 8. **Final Adjustment**: - If necessary, remove additional harbours from ( U ) and ( W ) to ensure both ( A subseteq U ) and ( B subseteq W ) with ( |A| = 477 ) and ( |B| = 477 ). # Conclusion: Thus, we obtain two disjoint sets ( A ) and ( B ) each containing 477 harbours, such that no direct ferry connection exists between any harbour in set ( A ) and any harbour in set ( B ).

Over the next some weeks (let's call this number of weeks x), he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks. So he eats another 14 apples over x weeks. 3. Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day. That's 3 * 7 = 21 apples per week. For two weeks, he eats 2 * 21 = 42 apples. 4. Over these 7 weeks (2 weeks + x weeks + 2 weeks), he averages 10 apples a week. So in total, he eats 7 * 10 = 70 apples over 7 weeks.

Let's consider two cases: - Case 1: (2b mid m). In this case, (m = 2bk) for some integer (k). We can construct a tiling by placing vertical dominoes of height (2 times b) (each domino covering two rows and (b) columns) across the entire length of (m) rows. This forms complete tiles across the entire (m times n) rectangle. - Case 2: (2b mid n). Here, (n = 2bk) for some integer (k). We can construct a tiling by placing horizontal dominoes of width (2 times b) (each domino covering two columns and (b) rows) across the entire width of (n) columns. This forms complete tiles across the entire (m times n) rectangle. These constructions demonstrate the ((0, b))-tileable property is satisfied under either condition. 2. **Proof of Sufficiency**: - Next, we show that if an (m times n) rectangle is ((0, b))-tileable, then either (2b mid m) or (2b mid n). - Assume that the (m times n) rectangle can be tiled with ((0, b))-tiles. Each ((0, b))-tile covers (2b) cells because each tile is of size (2 times b). 3. **Area Argument**: - The total area of the rectangle is (m times n). - Each ((0, b))-tile covers (2b) cells. Therefore, if the entire rectangle is tiled without gaps or overlaps, the total number of ((0, b))-tiles used is: [ text{Number of } (0, b) text{-tiles } = frac{m times n}{2b}. ] - Since the number of tiles must be an integer (indivisible tiling), it follows that (2b) must divide the total area (m times n). 4. **Divisibility Condition**: - For (2b) to divide (m times n), it must be the case that either (2b) divides (m) or (2b) divides (n) (or both). This is because (2b) being a factor of the product (m times n) necessitates it being a factor of at least one of the dimensions (m) or (n). # Conclusion: Hence, an (m times n) rectangle is ((0, b))-tileable if and only if (2b mid m) or (2b mid n).

For example, the clue Three digits, sum is 23 has only one answer: 6,8,9. The clue Three digits, sum is 8 has two answers: 1,3,4 and 1,2,5. If the clue Four digits, sum is n has the largest number of answers for any fourdigit clue, then what is the value of n? How many answers does this clue have? Explain why no other fourdigit clue can have more answers.","completion":"To solve the problem of finding the value of n for which a four-digit sum n has the largest number of distinct answers, let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Define the Problem Setup:** We are given a number k = 4 (since it's a four-digit problem) and we need to find the value of n (sum of the digits) that maximizes the number of distinct sets of four nonzero digits. We call this maximum number A(s, 4, 9) for a given s=n. 2. **Symmetry and Range:** By symmetry, for a sum s using digits from 1 to 9, we can replace each digit d with 10-d. This implies A(s, 4, 9) = A(40-s, 4, 9). Therefore, we only need to consider sums in the range from 10 (minimum sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) to 20, as investigating sums from 21 to 30 would give us the same number of answers as sums from 10 to 19. 3. **Calculate A(s, n, k) Recursively:** We compute A(s, n, k) recursively. Any sum can either include or exclude the digit k. Therefore, the options to form the sum s using n digits and maximum digit k are partitioned into: - A(s-k, n-1, k-1): where one of the digits is k, - A(s, n, k-1): where none of the digits is k. Hence, the recursive formula is: [ A(s, n, k) = A(s-k, n-1, k-1) + A(s, n, k-1) ] 4. **Boundary Conditions:** - A(s, 1, k) = 1 if 1 leq s leq k, otherwise 0, because only one digit s can sum to s. - A(s, n, k) = 0 if s < n (since sum of n digits has to be at least n). 5. **Fill the Table to Calculate A(s, n, k):** We start by computing values for n=2, then n=3, and finally n=4 as shown in the existing tables provided. # Tables: For reference, we'll recreate and extend the results from the provided solution: For n=2 [ begin{array}{l||ccccccccccccccc} n=2 & s=3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 hline k=2 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & & & & & k=3 & 1 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & & & k=4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & k=5 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & & k=6 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & k=7 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & k=8 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & k=9 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 hline end{array} ] For n=3 [ begin{array}{l||cccccccccccccccccccc} n=3 & s=6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 & 22 & 23 & 24 hline k=3 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & k=4 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & k=5 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & & & k=6 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & & & k=7 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & k=8 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & & k=9 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 7 & 8 & 8 & 8 & 7 & 7 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 hline end{array} ] For n=4 [ begin{array}{l||ccccccccccc} n=4 & s=10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 hline k=4 & 1 & & & & & & & & & & k=5 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & & & & & & & k=6 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & & k=7 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 k=8 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 5 & 7 & 7 & 8 & 7 & 7 k=9 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 6 & 8 & 9 & 11 & 11 & 12 hline end{array} ] From these calculations, we find that the maximum number of distinct answers occurs for s = 20 with 12 possible distinct answers.

We need to show that if five of these nine vertices are chosen arbitrarily, it is always possible to select four of these five vertices such that they form the vertices of a trapezium. 2. **Assume the contrary:** Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that it is not possible to find four points among the chosen five that form a trapezium. 3. **Claim:** For any pair of points ((X, Y)) chosen, exactly three pairs of points other than those chosen are restricted from being chosen. 4. **Proof of the claim:** We will consider three cases based on the relative positions of (X) and (Y) on the nonagon. - **Case 1: (X) and (Y) are adjacent.** Let (X = A) and (Y = B). The pairs ((I, C)), ((H, D)), and ((G, E)) are restricted from being chosen because choosing any of these pairs would form a trapezium with (A) and (B). - **Case 2: (X) and (Y) have one point between them.** Let (X = A) and (Y = C). The pairs ((I, D)), ((H, E)), and ((G, F)) are restricted from being chosen because choosing any of these pairs would form a trapezium with (A) and (C). - **Case 3: (X) and (Y) have two points between them.** Let (X = A) and (Y = D). The pairs ((B, C)), ((I, E)), and ((H, F)) are restricted from being chosen because choosing any of these pairs would form a trapezium with (A) and (D). These cases collectively prove our claim that for any pair of points ((X, Y)) chosen, exactly three pairs of points other than those chosen are restricted from being chosen. 5. **Counting pairs and restrictions:** Since we are choosing 5 points, we get (binom{5}{2} = 10) distinct pairs. From our claim, each pair restricts four pairs (including the pair being chosen itself) from being chosen. So, a total of (4 cdot binom{5}{2} = 4 cdot 10 = 40) pairs are restricted. 6. **Contradiction:** However, there are only (binom{9}{2} = 36) pairs of vertices in a nonagon, which is less than 40. This gives a contradiction because we cannot have more restrictions than the total number of pairs available. 7. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false.

We know that log _{2}4 and log _{2}8 equate to 2 and 3, respectively, since 2^2=4 and 2^3=8. Therefore, we have log _{2}4 < log _{2}5 < log _{2}8, which simplifies to 2 < a < 3.

We have 2^0 < 2^{0.3} < 2^1, which means 1 < b < 2.

Since points ( M ) and ( M_1 ) are symmetric with respect to ( O ), we have: [ MO = frac{M_1M}{2} ] 6.

Hence, any point ( M ) on the polygonal chain lies within a distance of ( frac{1}{4} ) from the midpoint ( O ), proving that the entire polygonal chain lies inside the circle of radius ( frac{1}{4} ) centered at ( O ).

Thus, the left focus F_{1} is at (-1,0). 2. **Determine the equation of line l passing through F_{1}:** Given F_{1}(-1,0), the line l passing through this point with a slope of 1 (since it's y=x+m and it passes through (-1,0), making m=1) is l: y=x+1. 3. **Find the intersection points of line l with the circle:** The circle's equation is x^{2}+y^{2}=4.

However, since A and B lie on the same line and are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we can find the distance |AB| more efficiently by considering the segment AB as a chord of the circle and using the formula for the length of a chord: 2sqrt{r^2-d^2}, where r is the radius of the circle and d is the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord. In this case, d=frac{1}{sqrt{2}} because the line l has a y-intercept of 1, and the line's slope of 1 implies an angle of 45^circ (or pi/4 radians) with the x-axis, making the distance from the origin to the line l equal to frac{1}{sqrt{2}} by considering a 45^circ-45^circ-90^circ triangle.

Now, comparing a+4 gt b with a gt b, it's clear that if a+4 gt b, then a is indeed greater than b by at least 4 units. However, this does not directly imply that a gt b without the additional 4 units. Therefore, while a+1 gt b-2 suggests a is greater than b by some margin, it does not directly establish a gt b without considering the additional 3 units (from the step of adding 3 to both sides of the initial inequality). 3. Conversely, if we start with a gt b, it's straightforward to deduce that a+1 gt b-2 by subtracting 3 from both sides of a gt b. This shows that if a is greater than b, adding 1 to a and subtracting 2 from b will still maintain the truth of the inequality. This step demonstrates that \\"a+1 gt b-2\\" is indeed a necessary condition for \\"a gt b\\" because if a is greater than b, then certainly a+1 will be greater than b-2. In conclusion, the relationship between \\"a+1 gt b-2\\" and \\"a gt b\\" is such that the former is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the latter. This is because while a+1 gt b-2 implies a is greater than b by some margin, it does not directly equate to a gt b without the additional context. Conversely, if a gt b, then a+1 gt b-2 naturally follows. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}: Necessary but not sufficient condition."},{"prompt":"Omar and Karen made egg rolls to share at the school potluck. Omar rolled 219 egg rolls.

We can substitute the values of x and y into this equation to find z: 100.48z = (100.70)² Now, let's calculate (100.70)²: (100.70)² = 100.70 * 100.70 = 10140.49 So, we have: 100.48z = 10140.49 Now, let's solve for z: z = 10140.49 / 100.48 z ≈ 100.92 Now we have the value of z.

The equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola are y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Since triangle OAB is equilateral, the slope of the asymptote OA, which is tan(30^circ), equals the ratio frac{b}{a}. Therefore, we have: tan(30^circ) = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{b}{a}. From this, we obtain that b = frac{a}{sqrt{3}}. Next, we know that for a hyperbola, the relationship between a, b, and the distance between the center and the foci (denoted as c) is given by the equation c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. Plugging in our expression for b in terms of a, we get: c = sqrt{a^2 + left(frac{a}{sqrt{3}}right)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + frac{a^2}{3}} = sqrt{frac{4a^2}{3}} = frac{2a}{sqrt{3}}. Since the line AB also passes through a focus of the hyperbola and given that |AB|=2, the distance from the origin O to F (which lies on the AB line) should be half of AB, which is 1. Thus, we have OF = 1. However, because OF is essentially the distance from the center to a focus and is denoted as c, we set c = 1.

Step 1: Understand that the symmetry condition implies the line 2x-ky-k=0 must pass through the center of the circle. Let's denote the center of the circle as C(a,b), with the given radius r=2. Step 2: The equation of the circle can be written as (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=4. Substituting the point (0,2) into this equation gives us a^{2}+(b-2)^{2}=4. Step 3: Since the line passes through the center (a,b), substituting (a,b) into the line equation 2x-ky-k=0 gives us 2a-kb-k=0. Step 4: Solving for k, we get k=frac{2a}{b+1}. Squaring both sides, we find k^{2}=frac{4a^{2}}{(b+1)^{2}}. Step 5: Using the circle's equation a^{2}+(b-2)^{2}=4, we can express a^{2} as 4-(b-2)^{2}=4-(b^{2}-4b+4)=-b^{2}+4b.

Therefore, [ x P(x) - 1 = c(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-9) ] 6. Solving for ( P(x) ), we get: [ x P(x) = c(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-9) + 1 ] [ P(x) = frac{c(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-9) + 1}{x} ] 7. Note that ( P(x) ) must be a polynomial of degree 8, so the degree of the numerator must be equal to the degree of the polynomial used. 8. To determine ( c ), compare the constant term. Setting ( x = 0 ) in ( c(x-1)(x-2) ldots (x-9) ): [ text{The constant term of } c(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-9) = c cdot (-1)(-2) cdots (-9) = c cdot (-1)^9 cdot 9! = -c cdot 9! ] Then, comparing with the constant term, we have: [ -c cdot 9! + 1 = 0 ] Solving for ( c ): [ -c cdot 9! = -1 implies c = frac{1}{9!} ] 9. Substituting ( c ) back into the equation for ( P(x) ): [ P(x) = frac{left( frac{1}{9!} right)(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-9) + 1}{x} ] Simplifying further, [ P(x) = frac{(x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-9) + 9!}{9! x} ] 10. To find ( P(10) ): [ P(10) = frac{(10-1)(10-2) cdots (10-9) + 9!}{9! cdot 10} ] Simplify the expression in the numerator: [ (10-1)(10-2) cdots (10-9) = 9! ] Thus, [ P(10) = frac{9! + 9!}{9! cdot 10} = frac{2 cdot 9!}{9! cdot 10} = frac{2}{10} = frac{1}{5} ] # Conclusion: (boxed{frac{1}{5}})"},{"prompt":"Ned bought some boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7.0 to his little brother.

Therefore, to verify if this octopus is telling the truth: - If the purple octopus had an even number of legs, he would not say he has 9 legs because he would speak the truth. - Since he claims to have 9 legs and this statement is not true, he must have an odd number of legs. Thus, the purple octopus lies and **has an odd number of legs**. 2. **Analyzing the Statements of the Dark Blue Octopus:** - The dark blue octopus says: \\"I have 8 legs, and you (green octopus) have only 7 legs!\\" - Based on the previous observation, an octopus with an even number of legs tells the truth, and with an odd number, lies. To check: - If the dark blue octopus had 8 legs, he would speak the truth. - However, the purple octopus, who lies, claims that the dark blue octopus does not have 8 legs. Therefore, considering the dark blue octopus claims he has 8 legs (and supposed he lies based on the purple octopus' lying statement), the dark blue octopus lies, meaning: - The dark blue octopus **does not have 8 legs but an odd number of legs** instead. 3. **Analyzing the Statements of the Green Octopus:** - The green octopus claims: \\"I have 8 legs, and you (dark blue octopus) have only 6 legs.\\" - We already established that the dark blue octopus does not have 8 legs, implying the green octopus' statement about the dark blue octopus is also a lie. Therefore: - If the green octopus lies about the number of legs the dark blue octopus has, the green octopus has an odd number of legs himself, since a liar has an odd number of legs. 4. **Analyzing the Statements of the Striped Octopus:** - The striped octopus asserts: \\"None of you have 8 legs; only I have 8 legs.\\" - So far, we identified all other octopuses (purple, dark blue, and green) to have an odd number of legs (liars). Thus, if the striped octopus' statement is to be checked: - If his claim is true, he should indeed have an even number of legs. 5. **Conclusion:** Since the striped octopus claims he alone has 8 legs, and since he’s telling the truth accordingly: - The only octopus with 8 legs (even number) is the striped octopus.

Since any white segment that does not intersect the black segment must lie either entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the black segment, we can split the space into segments. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** - Note that we have (2k-1) black segments and (2k-1) white segments, and each white segment intersects with at least (k) black segments and vice versa. - If a chosen white segment lies to the left of a corresponding black segment, we can repeat this for at least (k) black segments so that the left endpoint of each chosen black segment lies to the right of the right endpoint of the chosen white segments. 4. **Contradiction:** - Since there are (2k-1) segments, if we pick any (k) black segments, and their respective left endpoints are to the right of the right endpoints of the chosen white segments, then one of these white segments must intersect at least (k) other black segments. - However, we assumed earlier that no black segment intersects all white segments, which means one white segment intersects (k) other black segments.

Both A and B are non-empty. 6. **Claim: (A, B) is a Saddle Pair:** - **Proof of Claim:** - For any row i, there exists j in A such that a(j, p) ge a(i, p) for all p in B. - By condition (i) applied to (R', C'), there exists t in R' such that a(t, k) ge a(i, k) for all k in C'. - For any p in B, let the cycle containing p be p_0, p_1, dots, p_n, dots where p_0 = p_n = p and p_{i+1} = f(p_i). - By definition, a(t, p_0) le a(t, p_{-1}) le a(f(t), p_{-1}) le dots. - Define n_p as the minimal period of the cycle containing p.

First, note that because the polygon is regular and inscribed in a circle, the only possible distances between any two vertices ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) are the chord lengths connecting them. As a result, distances occur in specific incremental steps depending on the number of sides of the polygon their connecting chord skips. 3.

Therefore, the different distances possible are the chord lengths corresponding to 1, 2, …, 10 steps. 4.

Is there a way to distribute the balls into boxes such that, when these boxes are given to 20 students, each student ends up with the same number of balls?","completion":"Given: There are 20 different colors of balls, and each color has at least 10 balls, totalling 800 balls. The problem is to determine whether it is possible to distribute these balls into several boxes such that each box contains at least 10 balls, all of the same color. We are asked if there is a way to assign these boxes to 20 students so that each student gets exactly the same number of balls. We will use the method of mathematical induction to prove that such a distribution is possible. 1. **Base Case**: For ( n = 1 ): - There is 1 color and 40 balls (since ( 40 times 1 = 40 )). - The problem is straightforward because we can simply give all 40 balls to one student. Clearly, the statement holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for ( n - 1 ) colors. This means that for ( n - 1 ) colors, it is possible to distribute the balls into boxes such that each box has at least 10 balls of the same color, and each of the ( n-1 ) students gets exactly 40 balls. Now, consider ( n ) colors. We need to show that we can distribute the ( 40n ) balls (where each color has at least ( 10 ) balls) to ( n ) students such that each student gets exactly 40 balls. Let ( x ) and ( y ) be the number of balls of the most populous two colors. Then: [ x + y geq 80 ] 3. **Constructing New Distribution**: Assume ( x geq y ). Introduce a new color by combining these two colors. Let the number of balls of this new color be: [ z = x + y - 40 ] By the inductive hypothesis, we know that it is possible to distribute the balls for ( n - 1 ) remaining colors (including our new combined color) in such a way that each of the ( n-1 ) students receives 40 balls. 4. **Verifying the Distribution**: We now need to prove that each student can get 40 balls. We are given that: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} c_i = x + y - 40 ] where ( c_i ) are the number of balls of the new color in each of the ( k ) boxes. From the inductive hypothesis, every box contains between 10 and 20 balls. Let ( S_j = sum_{i=1}^{j} c_i ): [ x - sum_{i=1}^{k} c_i = 40 - y leq 30 ] At some point ( i_0 ): [ x - S_{i_0} leq 30 ] Therefore, ( x - S_{i_0} leq 30 ), and ( x - S_{i_0} = 40 - y ). Consequently, we can ensure that each student receives between 10 and 30 balls of the combined new color, and the same applies to the color with ( y ) balls. 5. **Conclusion**: By assigning the remaining balls, we ensure that: - Each of the original ( n - 1 ) students gets the revised number of balls (including portions of the new color), and - The remaining student receives exactly 40 balls, consisting of exactly 40 different balls. Thus, the distribution is possible for ( n ) students, proving the statement.

The vertices of these rectangles touch their corresponding points on (triangle A_1B_1C_1). 2. **Determine Parallel Sides**: By construction, the sides of triangle (ABC) are parallel to the corresponding sides of triangle (A_1B_1C_1). Specifically, [ AB parallel A_1B_1, quad BC parallel B_1C_1, quad CA parallel C_1A_1. ] This geometric property suggests that the triangles (ABC) and (A_1B_1C_1) are similarly oriented and scaled versions of each other. 3. **Homothety Center**: When two triangles have pairwise parallel sides, they are homothetic. There exists a homothety transformation centered at a point (P) (the homothety center) that maps triangle (ABC) to triangle (A_1B_1C_1).

Steps: 1. **Initial Matchup Strategy:** We need to consider a strategic matchup between players from group A and B. Choose the player a_{i} from group A and player b_{k-i} from group B to play a match. Here, k is a strategically chosen position we are targeting. 2. **Determine Potential Candidate Range:** - If a_{i} wins, then a_{i} is stronger than b_{k-i}, which means: - The strongest i-1 players in group A are stronger than a_{i}. - The strongest k-i-1 players in group B are stronger than b_{k-i}. - Thus, there are k-2 players stronger than the winner. - If b_{k-i} wins: - Similar reasoning applies, indicating there are at least k-1 players stronger than the loser. 3. **Iterative Halving:** The idea is to halve the number of potential candidates iteratively by these matchups. - For example, if A has 2n+1 players and B has 2n players, the 2n+1-th strongest combined ranking is our target. Set i=n+1 and have a_{n+1} from group A play b_n from group B. - If a_{n+1} wins, focus on the subset a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n+1} and b_1, ..., b_n. - This iterative approach divides the problem size by about half with each step. 4. **Specific Steps and General Strategy to Keep Track of Match Results:** - Generally, after each match, based on the winner, adjust the indices to focus on a reduced subset. - Keep repeating these steps until the last standing candidate marks the median player. 5. **Optimized Strategy with Large Groups:** One important aspect is ensuring that each step maximizes information gain, potentially by imagining new hypothetical players to simplify the problem (as done in the extended solution). 6. **Detailed Iterations and Calculations:** - Each step’s calculations identify the exact subset to focus on next. For instance, initial match helps finding the next critical n players to consider (having played a_i against b_{k-i}). Final Steps: To summarize towards finding the 1001st strongest player in the merged 2001 players: - Start by sorting imagined strong \\"matadors\\" and weak \\"dilettantes\\" as theoretical constructs to determine the exact set of matchups needed. - Use iterative calculations: [ 2001 rightarrow 1001 rightarrow 501 rightarrow 251 rightarrow 126 rightarrow 63 rightarrow 32 rightarrow 16 rightarrow 8 rightarrow 4 rightarrow 2 rightarrow 1 ] **Conclusion**: After 11 steps of comparisons, the median player from the combined 2001 players can be determined efficiently. boxed"},{"prompt":"The inscribed circle of triangle DEF is tangent to overline{DE} at point P, and its radius is 14.

Let's denote F(x) = f(2x-2). The symmetry about x=1 implies that F(x) = F(2-x). Substituting F(x) = f(2x-2) into this equation gives us: [f(2x-2) = f(2-2x)] This simplifies to: [f(x) = f(-x)] This shows that f(x) is an even function, which directly corresponds to option A. **Step 2: Analyzing Symmetry of f(frac{1}{2}x+1)** The graph of f(frac{1}{2}x+1) is symmetric about the point (2,0).

This can be established via induction: - **Base Case:** Initially, each side is its own foundation. - **Inductive Step:** When clipping, two new sides are formed, and the union of their foundations cannot exceed two original sides because they inherit from the originals being clipped, which were adjacent. 6. **Area Preservation:** The key to this solution is the observation: - Any convex polygon derived from the original regular hexagon mathcal{P}_6 by a series of clippings will always contain a subset of the original sides. - Importantly, the foundation of any new side formed remains confined to adjacent original sides, none of which span across the diagonal segments of mathcal{P}_6. 7. **Invariant Area:** Since at least a third of the original area is preserved within these intersections, the area of any resulting polygon mathcal{P}_n will always contain parts of triangles ACE or BDF, ensuring the areas of these intersections remain within the polygon. 8. **Conclusion:** As a result, the area of any n-gon formed through this process is safeguarded to be greater than frac{1}{3} of the original area, or in other words: [ boxed{frac{1}{3}} ] This formally concludes the proof that the area of mathcal{P}_n will indeed always be greater than frac{1}{3}, irrespective of the clippings."},{"prompt":"Does there exist an infinite set M of straight lines on the coordinate plane such that (i) no two lines are parallel, and (ii) for any integer point there is a line from M containing it?","completion":"To determine whether there exists an infinite set ( M ) of straight lines on the coordinate plane such that: 1.

Therefore, no two lines will have the same slope, ensuring that no two lines are parallel. 3. **Verifying Coverage of All Integer Points:** - For any integer point ((a, b)), we need to show that there is a line from ( M ) that contains it. - By construction, each line is defined to pass through a specific integer point ((a, b)) and another point ((a+1, b + k)). Therefore, every integer point ((a, b)) is included in at least one line from ( M ). Since the construction ensures that no two lines are parallel and every integer point is covered by at least one line, we have satisfied both conditions.

We are to find all golden matrices of all sizes. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Case ( n = 1 )**: - For ( n = 1 ), the matrix is ( 1 times 1 ) and contains only one element, which must be 1. - Clearly, in this case, the row and the column consist of the single number 1, which is equal to ( 2 times 1 - 1 = 1 ). Hence, the ( 1 times 1 ) matrix ( left[1right] ) is golden. 2. **General Case ( n > 1 )**: - Consider any ( n times n ) matrix for ( n > 1 ). According to the problem, for the matrix to be golden, each number in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1} ) must appear in each row-col union. - Since there are ( 2n-1 ) distinct numbers, if some number ( k ) does not appear in at least one row or one column, then the union of this row and column will not contain ( k ), which contradicts the requirement. 3. **Minimum Frequency Requirement**: - Therefore, each number ( k in {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1} ) must appear at least ( n ) times in the matrix (to ensure it appears in every row and column's union). This gives us: [ text{Total minimum number of entries} = n times (2n-1) ] - The total number of entries in an ( n times n ) matrix is: [ n^2 ] - Therefore, we must have: [ n^2 geq n(2n-1) ] - Simplify this inequality: [ n^2 geq 2n^2 - n implies n^2 - 2n^2 + n leq 0 implies -n^2 + n leq 0 implies n leq 1 ] 4. **Conclusion for general ( n )**: - Since ( n leq 1 ) and ( n ) must be a positive integer, it implies ( n = 1 ) is the only possibility for a golden matrix to exist. - Thus, the only ( n times n ) golden matrix is the ( 1 times 1 ) matrix whose single entry is 1. [ boxed{n=1} ] 5. **Alternate Verification**: - In any golden matrix, the union of a row and a column must contain exactly ( 2n-1 ) entries, meaning these numbers must appear exactly once in this union. - Each number appearing twice (i.e., in different rows and columns), would lead to duplicate entries in the row-column union, making it impossible to cover the necessary ( 2n-1 ) distinct numbers. - Hence, every element in ( {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1} ) must appear exactly once in such a matrix. 6. **Final Mathematical Validation**: - This confirms there are no numbers other than 1 in a matrix, no repeated numbers, and thus, given the conditions: [ n^2 = 2n - 1 implies n^2 - 2n + 1 = 0 implies (n - 1)^2 = 0 implies n = 1 ] - Therefore, other than the ( 1 times 1 ) case, no other ( n times n ) matrix can be golden.

We will assess the validity of each statement: A. m parallel gamma, alpha perp gamma: We cannot confirm that line m is parallel to plane gamma, nor can we immediately state anything about the perpendicularity of alpha and gamma. Hence, we cannot conclude A to be necessarily correct based on the given information. B. n parallel beta, alpha perp gamma: Since n perp alpha and alpha perp beta, we find that n is orthogonal to the intersection line of alpha and beta (which is m). We cannot say anything about the relationship between beta and gamma. So it is not necessarily true. C. beta parallel gamma, alpha perp gamma: There is no information to conclude that planes beta and gamma are parallel without additional information, nor about the relationship between alpha and gamma. D. m perp n, alpha perp gamma: Based on the fact that n perp alpha and alpha cap beta = m, which implies that m lies in both alpha and beta, we know that any line perpendicular to alpha will be perpendicular to m as well. As n subset gamma and n perp alpha, we can conclude that gamma (which contains line n) will also be perpendicular to alpha because any line contained in gamma and perpendicular to alpha enforces gamma and alpha to be perpendicular.

The semiperimeter ( p ) is defined as: [ p = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] The area ( A ) of the triangle can be written as: [ A = r cdot p ] This follows from the formula ( A = r cdot p ) where ( r ) is the radius of the inscribed circle. 3. **Selection of Integer-sided Triangle**: We need to select triangles with integer sides such that the semiperimeter and the radius form the relation ( p = n r ). One classical example of triangles with integer sides and integer radius is Heronian triangles. 4. **Example of Heronian Triangles**: Consider the following specific set of Heronian triangles: - Consider an integer ( k ). A known Heronian triangle is given by sides: [ (a, b, c) = (k (m^2 + n^2), k (m^2 - n^2), 2kmn) ] Where ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers such that ( m > n ). 5. **Semiperimeter Calculation**: The semiperimeter ( p ) of this triangle becomes: [ p = frac{a + b + c}{2} = frac{k (m^2 + n^2) + k (m^2 - n^2) + 2kmn}{2} = k m^2 + k mn ] 6. **Radius Calculation**: Using the area formula and ( p ), we find the radius ( r ). The area ( A ) can also be given using Heron's formula: [ A = sqrt{p (p-a)(p-b)(p-c)} ] For our choice of ( a, b, ) and ( c ): [ A = sqrt{(k m^2 + k mn)(k mn)(k mn)(k mn)} = k^2 mn (m^2 + n^2) ] Equating the area formulas we get: [ k^2 mn (m^2 + n^2) = r cdot (k m^2 + k mn) ] Solving for ( r ): [ r = frac{k^2 mn (m^2 + n^2)}{k m^2 + k mn} = k mn ] 7. **Verification of ( p = nr )**: Since ( r = k mn ), and substituting back into ( p ): [ p = k m^2 + k mn = k mn + k m^2 = n r ] Hence, we have ( p = n r ) where ( n = m + m/n ). 8. **Infinite Solutions**: We can choose infinite values for ( k, m ) and ( n ) such that ( m > n ) and both are integers, ensuring the formation of an infinite set of triangles fitting the given criteria. 9. **Conclusion**: We have thus demonstrated that there exists an infinite number of ( n ) for which there exists a triangle with integer sides satisfying the condition ( p = n r ).

So, the cost equation based on the number of tiles and their costs would be: 3G + 1.5R = 2100 We already have the equation G + R = 1000 from the total number of tiles. We can use this to express R in terms of G: R = 1000 - G Now we can substitute R in the cost equation: 3G + 1.5(1000 - G) = 2100 Expanding the equation: 3G + 1500 - 1.5G = 2100 Combining like terms: 1.5G = 2100 - 1500 1.5G = 600 Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for G: G = 600 / 1.5 G = 400 So, there are 400 green marble tiles.

This can be represented as 0.03 * (S - 10000), but only if S > 10000. The total commission the salesman receives is Rs. 1380, which is the sum of the 9% commission on total sales and the additional 3% commission on the excess over Rs. 10000 (if applicable). So, the equation representing the total commission is: 0.09 * S + 0.03 * (S - 10000) = 1380, if S > 10000. If S is less than or equal to 10000, then the equation is simply: 0.09 * S = 1380. Since the salesman received a total commission of Rs. 1380, which includes a bonus, we know that S must be greater than 10000.

This represents a parabola that is upward opening and has zeros at x = 1 and x = a. The solution to this inequality is that x lies between the two roots if a > 1, or outside if a < 1. Considering that, to be a subset of B, the interval of A has to stay within the interval of B, dictated by the endpoints 1 and 3 (since log_2(2) = 1 and log_2(4) = 2). For set B, from log_2(x+1) boundaries (1 to 2), we find the corresponding x-value boundaries are 1 and 3 respectively. Therefore, B = {x | 1 leq x leq 3}.

This gives us the simplified form of the first part of the expression: frac{x-3}{2x-4} = frac{x-3}{2(x-2)}. Next, we simplify the second part of the expression. We can rewrite frac{5}{x-2}-x-2 as frac{5-(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2} by finding a common denominator: frac{5}{x-2}-x-2 = frac{5-(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2}. 2. **Combine the two parts using division as multiplication by the reciprocal:** The original expression can now be rewritten as: frac{x-3}{2(x-2)}div left(frac{5-(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2}right) = frac{x-3}{2(x-2)}cdot frac{x-2}{5-(x+2)(x-2)}.

Let the number sequence starting from a certain position and including 1953 digits be denoted by: [ A = overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_{1952} a_{1953}} ] 2.

We know (A) can be written as (a_{1953} cdot 10^{1953} + overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_{1952}}): [ A = a_{1953} cdot 10^{1953} + overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_{1952}} ] 7. We also know that (27) divides (A). Therefore, we need to examine the term (10^{1953} + 1): [ 10^{1953} equiv 1 (bmod 27) ] This relation comes from the property of modular arithmetic where (10^3 equiv 1 (bmod 27)), given that (phi(27) = 18), and (1953 equiv 3 (bmod 18)). 8. Given (a_{1953} cdot (10^{1953} + 1)), we see: [ 10B + a_{1953} equiv a_{1953} (bmod 27) ] 9. Since (overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_{1952}} = A - a_{1953} cdot 10^{1953}): 10.

Xiao Liang, who has just graduated from college, put his family's sweet potato products for sale online. He originally planned to sell 100 kilograms per day. Due to various reasons, the actual daily sales volume deviates from the planned amount. The table below shows the sales situation during the National Day holiday (excess is recorded as positive, shortfall as negative, unit: kilograms): | Time | 1st day | 2nd day | 3rd day | 4th day | 5th day | 6th day | 7th day | ||||||||| | Deviation from Planned Amount | +8 | 2 | +17 | +22 | 5 | 8 | 3 | (1) According to the table above, how many kilograms were sold in the first three days in total? (2) How many kilograms more were sold on the day with the highest sales compared to the day with the lowest sales? (3) If each kilogram is sold for 2.5 yuan and an average shipping cost of 0.5 yuan per kilogram is required, how much money did Xiao Liang earn during the National Day holiday?","completion":"To solve the given problems, let's break down the solution into detailed steps: # (1) Total Kilograms Sold in the First Three Days To find the total kilograms sold in the first three days, we add the planned amount to the deviation for each day, and then sum these amounts. - **1st Day**: Planned amount is 100 kg, deviation is +8 kg, so sales were 100 + 8 = 108 kg. - **2nd Day**: Planned amount is 100 kg, deviation is -2 kg, so sales were 100 - 2 = 98 kg. - **3rd Day**: Planned amount is 100 kg, deviation is +17 kg, so sales were 100 + 17 = 117 kg. Adding these amounts together gives the total sales for the first three days: 108 + 98 + 117 = 323text{ kg}. Therefore, the total kilograms sold in the first three days were boxed{323text{ kg}}. # (2) Difference Between Highest and Lowest Sales Day To find the day with the highest and lowest sales, we calculate the sales for each day and then find the difference. - **Highest Sales Day**: The highest deviation is +22 kg on the 4th day, so the sales were 100 + 22 = 122 kg. - **Lowest Sales Day**: The lowest deviation is -8 kg on the 6th day, so the sales were 100 - 8 = 92 kg. The difference between the highest and lowest sales day is: 122 - 92 = 30text{ kg}. Therefore, the day with the highest sales had boxed{30text{ kg}} more sales than the day with the lowest sales. # (3) Total Earnings During the National Day Holiday To calculate the total earnings, we first find the total kilograms sold during the holiday, then calculate the earnings by subtracting the shipping cost from the selling price per kilogram. - **Total Kilograms Sold**: The total deviation is 8 + (-2) + 17 + 22 + (-5) + (-8) + (-3) = 29 kg. Adding this to the planned amount of 100 kg per day for 7 days gives 100 times 7 + 29 = 729 kg. - **Earnings**: Each kilogram is sold for 2.5 yuan with a shipping cost of 0.5 yuan, so the net earning per kilogram is 2.5 - 0.5 = 2 yuan. Multiplying the total kilograms sold by the net earning per kilogram gives the total earnings: 729 times 2 = 1458text{ yuan}. Therefore, Xiao Liang earned a total of boxed{1458text{ yuan}} during the National Day holiday."},{"prompt":"James gets bored with his game so decides to play a different one.

He also has a mod that adds a skip feature, which bypasses 15% of all tedious activities, not affecting enjoyable gameplay. How much enjoyable gameplay does James get from the game and expansion, accounting for the mod's skip feature?","completion":"First, let's calculate the enjoyable gameplay from the original game before the expansion: The original game promises 150 hours of gameplay, but 70% of that is boring grinding. So, the enjoyable gameplay is 30% of the original gameplay time. Enjoyable gameplay from the original game = 150 hours * 30% = 150 * 0.30 = 45 hours Now, let's calculate the enjoyable gameplay from the expansion: The expansion promises 50 hours of gameplay, but 25% of that is spent on load screens, so we subtract that time: Time not on load screens = 50 hours * (1 - 25%) = 50 * 0.75 = 37.5 hours From the remaining time, a quarter is spent on tedious inventory management, so we subtract that time as well: Time not on inventory management = 37.5 hours * (1 - 25%) = 37.5 * 0.75 = 28.125 hours Now, let's account for the mod's skip feature, which bypasses 15% of all tedious activities. We need to calculate the total tedious time from both the original game and the expansion and then apply the mod's effect. Total tedious time from the original game (grinding) = 150 hours * 70% = 150 * 0.70 = 105 hours Total tedious time from the expansion (load screens + inventory management) = 50 hours - 28.125 hours = 21.875 hours Total tedious time from both = 105 hours + 21.875 hours = 126.875 hours The mod skips 15% of this tedious time: Time skipped by the mod = 126.875 hours * 15% = 126.875 * 0.15 = 19.03125 hours Now, we add the time skipped by the mod to the enjoyable gameplay time we calculated earlier: Total enjoyable gameplay from the original game and expansion = 45 hours (original game) + 28.125 hours (expansion) + 19.03125 hours (mod skip) Total enjoyable gameplay = 45 + 28.125 + 19.03125 = 92.15625 hours So, James gets approximately boxed{92.16} hours of enjoyable gameplay from the game and expansion, accounting for the mod's skip feature."},{"prompt":"Let P be a plane passing through the origin.

Consequently, ( [a_m, b_m] ) lies completely to the left of ( [a_i, b_i] ), making these intervals disjoint. 5. **Combining These Insights:** If both (a_M notin [a_i, b_i]) and (b_m notin [a_i, b_i]), then the intervals ([a_M, b_M]), ([a_i, b_i]), and ([a_m, b_m]) are disjoint. However, this contradicts the problem’s statement that amongst any three people, there are two who met in the library. 6. **Conclusion:** Hence, for every ( i ), it must be true that either ( a_M in [a_i, b_i] ) or ( b_m in [a_i, b_i] ). This implies that all visitors were present either at time (a_M) or at time (b_m), ensuring that any two people in the library coincided during at least one of these moments. Thus, there were indeed two moments, ( T = a_M ) and ( T' = b_m ), such that everyone who visited the library yesterday was present at ( T ) or ( T' ) (or both).

If two of these three circles are tangent to the incircle of ABC , prove that the third is tangent as well.","completion":"To prove that if two of the circles having as diameters the medians of a triangle are tangent to the incircle, then the third circle is also tangent to the incircle, we will proceed as follows: 1. **Define the Medians and Circles:** Let ( m_a, m_b, m_c ) be the medians of triangle ( ABC ) corresponding to vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) respectively. Let ( mathcal{M}_a, mathcal{M}_b, mathcal{M}_c ) be the circles with diameters ( m_a, m_b, m_c ) respectively. 2. **Properties of Medians and Circles:** The medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid ( G ), which divides each median in the ratio ( 2:1 ). The length of each median can be found using Apollonius's theorem: [ m_a = sqrt{frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}} ] where ( a, b, c ) are the sides of the triangle opposite to vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) respectively. 3. **Incircle and Tangency Condition:** The incircle of ( triangle ABC ) is tangent to the sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) at points ( D, E, ) and ( F ) respectively. Let ( I ) be the incenter of ( triangle ABC ). 4. **Tangency of Circles:** Suppose ( mathcal{M}_a ) and ( mathcal{M}_b ) are tangent to the incircle ( (I) ). We need to show that ( mathcal{M}_c ) is also tangent to ( (I) ). 5. **Equilateral Triangle Condition:** Consider the special case where ( triangle ABC ) is equilateral. In this case, all medians are equal, and the circles ( mathcal{M}_a, mathcal{M}_b, mathcal{M}_c ) are congruent. Since the incircle is equidistant from all sides, it is tangent to all three circles. 6. **General Case:** For a general triangle, if two of the circles ( mathcal{M}_a ) and ( mathcal{M}_b ) are tangent to the incircle, the tangency points must lie on the line segments connecting the centroid ( G ) to the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides of the triangle. This implies a symmetry in the configuration of the triangle. 7. **Symmetry and Conclusion:** The symmetry implies that the third circle ( mathcal{M}_c ) must also be tangent to the incircle. This is because the tangency condition is preserved under the symmetry of the triangle's medians and the incircle. Therefore, if two of the circles ( mathcal{M}_a, mathcal{M}_b, mathcal{M}_c ) are tangent to the incircle, the third circle must also be tangent to the incircle.

This simplification can be generalized: if any portion of the circle is covered by ( k ) arcs, it can be maintained by selecting the minimum ( k - 1 ) arcs covering that portion. 5. **Summarizing the Process**: By continuously applying this reduction, we ensure each segment of the circle is covered by at most ( 2 ) arcs.

We need to find the maximum number of different binary strings of length ( n ) that can be created under the given constraints. 3. **Upper bound on the number of binary strings:** Consider the complement string of each column. Let ( s_i ) be the complement string of column ( i ). It is clear that we cannot create the strings ( s_1, s_2, dots, s_n ) because each string ( s_i ) would require selecting the complement of the entire column ( i ), which is not possible under the given constraints.

We can construct the binary strings by ensuring that for any two people, there exists a fish kind (or equivalently, a column in the binary string) where they have different types (one 0, one 1).

Observe that the centers of the squares (being the midpoints of the squares) are equidistant from the corresponding vertices of the parallelogram where the squares are constructed. 3. Considering the parallelogram, denote the sides as ( DA = a ), ( AB = b ), and ( angle DAB = alpha ). 4. Each square constructed on the sides of the parallelogram contributes an angle of ( 90^circ ) to the angles around these squares. 5. Let’s first examine the location and orientation of the squares: - The square on ( DA ) is rotated ( 45^circ ) relative to edge ( DA ). - The center of the square located on side ( DA ) is ( frac{1}{2} a ) units from ( D ) and ( A ), positioned perpendicularly. - The angle between line segments from points ( P ) to ( A ) and from ( A ) to ( Q ) includes the original angle of the parallelogram plus the ( 45^circ ) rotation from the square construction, thus ( angle PAQ = 90^circ + alpha ). 6. Similarly, the square on ( AB ) is perpendicular to side ( AB ), and the center ( Q ) of that square can be perceived similarly. In this square: - Vertices ( A ) and ( B ) contribute to the angles formed by these centers. 7. We should now demonstrate that the line segments ( PQ ) and ( QR ) are perpendicular. Consider: - ( triangle PAQ ) and ( triangle RBQ ), both triangles formed by the centers and vertices of the squares. - Each segment ( PA ), ( AQ ), ( BQ ), and ( QB ) positioned in the triangles is perpendicular by definition of the centers being the midpoints of the squares. - Thus ( AQ perp PQ ) and ( BQ perp QR ). 8. Note that since both ( PAQ ) and ( RBQ ) portray symmetric properties and mechanism of the square construction and considering the geometric relationships of the parallelogram along with these squares, we deduce: - ( angle PAQ = angle RBQ = 90^circ + alpha ). 9. Since the line segments connecting ( P, Q, R ) inherit these properties and are each bounded by these angles (rotations caused by the squares), they form a mutually perpendicular configuration. 10. Thus, constructing these line segments results in forming right angles between them, enclosing each segment appropriately. 11.

As ( x to 0^+ ), ( f(x) to infty ) because the terms ( frac{a_i}{x^i} ) dominate. 5. As ( x to infty ), ( f(x) to 0 ) because each term ( frac{a_i}{x^i} ) approaches zero. 6. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since ( f(x) ) is continuous and strictly decreasing from ( infty ) to ( 0 ), there exists a unique ( R > 0 ) such that ( f(R) = 1 ). Thus, the polynomial ( p(x) ) has precisely one positive real root ( R ). # Part (b) 1.

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ ln left( sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_i}{R^i} right) = ln f(R) = ln 1 = 0 ] 3. Therefore, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_i}{A} ln left( frac{A}{R^i} right) leq 0 ] 4. Expanding the left-hand side, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_i}{A} left( ln A - i ln R right) = ln A sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_i}{A} - ln R sum_{i=1}^n frac{ia_i}{A} ] 5. Since ( sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_i}{A} = 1 ), this simplifies to: [ ln A - frac{ln R}{A} sum_{i=1}^n ia_i leq 0 ] 6. Let ( B = sum_{i=1}^n ia_i ). Then: [ ln A leq frac{B ln R}{A} ] 7.

(1) Find the functional relationship between y and x; (2) Find the functional relationship between the daily sales profit w (yuan) and the selling price x (yuan).

Also, for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the daily sales decrease by 10 items. This relationship can be mathematically represented as follows: 1. Let the increase in selling price from 8 yuan be (x-8), where x is the new selling price. 2. The decrease in items sold per day due to the price increase is 10(x-8). 3. Therefore, the new daily sales y can be represented as 200 - 10(x-8). Simplifying the expression for y: [ y = 200 - 10(x - 8) = 200 - 10x + 80 = -10x + 280 ] Thus, the functional relationship between y and x is: [ y = -10x + 280 quad text{for} quad 6 leqslant x leqslant 12 ] Part 2: Finding the Functional Relationship Between w and x, and Maximizing Daily Sales Profit 1. The profit for each item sold is (x - 6), where 6 is the cost price. 2. The daily sales profit w can be represented as the product of the profit per item and the number of items sold, which is (x - 6)y. Substituting y = -10x + 280 into the expression for w: [ w = (x - 6)(-10x + 280) = -10x^2 + 280x - 60x + 1680 = -10x^2 + 220x + 1680 ] Completing the square to find the vertex of the parabola, which represents the maximum profit: [ w = -10(x^2 - 22x) + 1680 = -10[(x - 11)^2 - 121] + 1680 = -10(x - 11)^2 + 1210 ] Since the coefficient of (x - 11)^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at x = 11. However, the selling price is restricted to not exceed 12 yuan. Therefore, we evaluate the profit at the maximum allowed selling price, x = 12. Substituting x = 12 into the profit function: [ w = -10(12 - 6)(-10*12 + 280) = -10(6)(-120 + 280) = -10(6)(160) = 960 ] Therefore, when the selling price x is 12 yuan, the daily sales profit is maximized, and the maximum profit is boxed{960 text{ yuan}}."},{"prompt":"a certain company , a third of the workers do not have a retirement plan . 40 % of the workers who do not have a retirement plan are women , and 40 % of the workers who do have a retirement plan are men . if 120 of the workers of that company are men , how many of the workers are women ?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of workers in the company as W.

So, the number of women without a retirement plan is 0.40 * (1/3)W = (2/15)W. - 40% of the workers who do have a retirement plan are men. This means that 60% of the workers who do have a retirement plan are women.

Step 2: Apply AM-GM to the given expression We apply AM-GM to the terms 2x and frac{1}{2x}: frac{2x + frac{1}{2x}}{2} geq sqrt{2x cdot frac{1}{2x}} Simplifying this gives: 2x + frac{1}{2x} geq 2sqrt{2x cdot frac{1}{2x}} Since sqrt{2x cdot frac{1}{2x}} = sqrt{1} = 1, we have: 2x + frac{1}{2x} geq 2 Step 3: Add the constant term to both sides Adding 1 to both sides of the inequality, we get: 2x + frac{1}{2x} + 1 geq 2 + 1 2x + frac{1}{2x} + 1 geq 3 Step 4: Determine when equality holds Equality in the AM-GM inequality holds if and only if 2x = frac{1}{2x}.

These points are such that the distance between any two of them is either (1), (sqrt{2}), or (2).

This derivative tells us how the function f(x) changes as x changes. 2. **Sign of f'(x)**: By examining f'(x) = frac{e^x(x-1)}{x^2}, we note that for x in (0,1), x-1<0 and e^x > 0 for all x, which means f'(x) < 0 throughout the interval (0,1). This indicates that f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0,1). 3. **Comparing f(frac{2}{5}) and f(frac{3}{4})**: Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing, and frac{2}{5} < frac{3}{4}, it follows that f(frac{2}{5}) > f(frac{3}{4}). Substituting the values into f(x) gives us frac{e^{frac{2}{5}}}{frac{2}{5}} > frac{e^{frac{3}{4}}}{frac{3}{4}}. This simplifies to frac{3}{4}e^{frac{2}{5}} > frac{2}{5}e^{frac{3}{4}}, which means a > c. 4. **Comparing c and b**: To compare c and b, we look at their difference: c - b = frac{2}{5}e^{frac{3}{4}} - frac{2}{5} = frac{2}{5}(e^{frac{3}{4}} - 1). Since e^{frac{3}{4}} > 1, it follows that c - b > 0, which means c > b. Combining the findings from steps 3 and 4, we conclude that b < c < a.

From these conditions, we can use the Law of Sines to relate the sides and angles of the triangle. Specifically: frac{AB}{sin(angle C)} = frac{BC}{sin(angle A)} = frac{AC}{sin(angle B)} 3. Given that AB = 2BC, substitute into the Law of Sines: frac{2BC}{sin(angle C)} = frac{BC}{sin(angle A)} Simplifying, we get: 2sin(angle A) = sin(angle C) 4. Also, we are given angle B = 2angle A.

Let's define the function f(x) = (x + y)left(frac{a}{x} + frac{4}{y}right), where a > 0. Simplifying f(x), we get: f(x) = a + 4 + frac{ay}{x} + frac{4x}{y}. Applying AM-GM inequality to the terms frac{ay}{x} and frac{4x}{y}, we have: frac{ay}{x} + frac{4x}{y} geq 2sqrt{frac{ay}{x} cdot frac{4x}{y}} = 2sqrt{4a}= 4sqrt{a}. Thus, the function f(x) can be bounded below by: f(x) geq a + 4 + 4sqrt{a}. Equality occurs if and only if frac{ay}{x} = frac{4x}{y}, or equivalently frac{x}{y} = frac{sqrt{a}}{2}. To find the minimum value of a, we set a + 4 + 4sqrt{a} equal to 16: a + 4sqrt{a} + 4 = 16. Solving for a, we subtract 4 from both sides: a + 4sqrt{a} = 12. Next, let's isolate the term 4sqrt{a}: 4sqrt{a} = 12 - a. Squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root, we get: 16a = (12 - a)^2. Expanding the right side: 16a = 144 - 24a + a^2. Reorganizing the terms: a^2 + 40a - 144 = 0. We can solve this quadratic equation to find the roots. In this case, we are only interested in the positive root since a must be a positive real number. Looking at the equation, we can factor it directly: (a - 4)(a + 36) = 0. So, the positive root is a = 4.

Since ( N ) is the smallest number that cannot be displayed, it must be even, because if ( N ) were odd, ( N-1 ) (an even number) could be displayed and flipping the switch would yield ( N ). 2. **Analyzing Modulo 3 Conditions**: - ( N ) cannot be divisible by 3 because if ( N = 3K ) for some ( K ), pressing the yellow button on the calculator when the display shows ( K ) (which is displayable and smaller than ( N )) would result in ( N ). - If ( N equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then multiplying it by 3 and adjusting with the switch would yield ( frac{N+1}{3} ).

A: 266 B: 270 C: 271 D: 285","completion":"To solve this problem using Pick's theorem, we need to find the number of lattice points on the boundary (L) and use the area of the triangle (S) to find the number of lattice points inside the triangle (N). **Step 1: Find the number of lattice points on side OA.** Since A(0,30), moving from O(0,0) to A(0,30) along the y-axis, we encounter lattice points at every integer value of y. This gives us 31 lattice points (including both O and A). **Step 2: Find the number of lattice points on side OB.** The equation of line OB is y=frac{1}{2}x. For y to be an integer, x must be an even number. Since x ranges from 0 to 20, there are 10 lattice points on OB (excluding O but including B). **Step 3: Find the number of lattice points on side AB.** The equation of line AB is y=-x+30. For integer values of x between 0 and 20, y is also an integer. This gives us 19 lattice points on AB (excluding the endpoints). **Step 4: Calculate the total number of lattice points on the boundary (L).** L = 31 + 10 + 19 = 60 **Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle ABO.** The area S is given by frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 30 times 20 = 300. **Step 6: Use Pick's theorem to find the number of lattice points inside the triangle.** Pick's theorem states that S = N + frac{1}{2}L - 1. Substituting the known values, we get: 300 = N + frac{1}{2} times 60 - 1 Solving for N, we find: N = 300 - 30 + 1 = 271 Therefore, the number of lattice points inside triangle ABO is boxed{271}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"A ferry boat shuttles tourists to an island every hour starting at 10 AM until its last trip, which starts at 2 PM.

When both taps are opened simultaneously, the net filling rate per hour is the filling rate minus the emptying rate: Net rate = Filling rate - Emptying rate Net rate = ( frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{9} ) To find a common denominator, we can use 45 (since 5 * 9 = 45): Net rate = ( frac{9}{45} - frac{5}{45} ) Net rate = ( frac{4}{45} ) of the cistern per hour This means that every hour, ( frac{4}{45} ) of the cistern gets filled when both taps are open.

(2) Since f(x)=e^{2x}-2x+x^{2}, we have g(x)=fleft( frac {x}{2}right)- frac {1}{4}x^{2}+(1-a)x+a=e^{x}+ frac {1}{4}x^{2}-x- frac {1}{4}x^{2}+(1-a)x+a=e^{x}-a(x-1), and thus g'(x)=e^{x}-a. - When aleqslant 0, g'(x) > 0, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}; - When a > 0, from g'(x)=e^{x}-a=0, we get x=ln a. Therefore, when xin(-infty,ln a), g'(x) < 0, g(x) is monotonically decreasing; when xin(ln a,+infty), g'(x) > 0, g(x) is monotonically increasing. In summary, when aleqslant 0, the monotonic increasing interval for g(x) is (-infty,+infty); when a > 0, the monotonic increasing interval for g(x) is (ln a,+infty), and the monotonic decreasing interval is (-infty,ln a). (3) Let p(x)= frac {e}{x}-ln x and q(x)=e^{x-1}+a-ln x. Since p'(x)=- frac {e}{x^{2}}- frac {1}{x} < 0, p(x) is a decreasing function on xin[1,+infty), and with p(e)=0, when 1leqslant xleqslant e, p(x)geqslant 0; when x > e, p(x) < 0. Since q'(x)=e^{x-1}- frac {1}{x} and q''(x)=e^{x-1}+ frac {1}{x^{2}} > 0, q'(x) is an increasing function on xin[1,+infty), and with q'(1)=0, for xin[1,+infty), q'(x)geqslant 0, thus q(x) is an increasing function on xin[1,+infty), and q(x)geqslant q(1)=a+1 > 0. - When 1leqslant xleqslant e, |p(x)|-|q(x)|=p(x)-q(x)= frac {e}{x}-e^{x-1}-a. Let m(x)= frac {e}{x}-e^{x-1}-a, then m'(x)=- frac {e}{x^{2}}-e^{x-1} < 0, so m(x) is a decreasing function on xin[1,+infty), thus m(x)leqslant m(1)=e-1-a. Since ageqslant 2, m(x) < 0, thus |p(x)| < |q(x)|, meaning frac {e}{x} is closer to ln x than e^{x-1}+a. - When x > e, |p(x)|-|q(x)|=-p(x)-q(x)=- frac {e}{x}+2ln x-e^{x-1}-a < 2ln x-e^{x-1}-a. Let n(x)=2ln x-e^{x-1}-a, then n'(x)= frac {2}{x}-e^{x-1} and n''(x)=- frac {2}{x^{2}}-e^{x-1} < 0, so n'(x) is a decreasing function when x > e, thus n'(x) < n'(e)= frac {2}{e}-e^{e-1} < 0, and n(x) is a decreasing function when x > e, thus n(x) < n(e)=2-a-e^{e-1} < 0, meaning |p(x)| < |q(x)|, so frac{e}{x} is closer to ln x than e^{x-1}+a.

We tackle this in two parts: 1. **Solving x^{2}+ax=0:** Factoring out x, we get x(x+a)=0 which gives us x_{1}=0 and x_{2}=-a. These are two roots, but we must consider the possibility that -a=0 which would result in a single distinct root if a=0. Thus, this part contributes either one or two real roots based on the value of a. 2. **Solving x^{2}+ax+3=0:** To determine the number of real roots, we look at the discriminant, Delta=a^{2}-4(1)(3)=a^{2}-12. - If Delta > 0, that is a^{2}-12>0 implies a>2sqrt{3} or a<-2sqrt{3}, there are two distinct real roots given by x_{3}=frac{-a-sqrt{a^{2}-12}}{2} and x_{4}=frac{-a+sqrt{a^{2}-12}}{2}. - If Delta = 0, that is a^{2}-12=0 implies a=-2sqrt{3} or a=2sqrt{3}, there is exactly one real root. - If Delta < 0, that is a^{2}-12<0 implies -2sqrt{3}<a<2sqrt{3}, there are no real roots.

Since the series of three rotations brings point B back to itself, we conclude each pair must cumulatively cancel out: ( 60^circ + 60^circ + 240^circ = 360^circ ) This thus indicates that the rotations are symmetrical and represent no net rotation, i.e., an identity transformation. 5. **Proving Isosceles Triangle and Angle:** - Given that these transformations exhibit symmetry, and circular geometry inherently provides equal length and angle bisectors, the isosceles nature of triangle A_1 B_1 M follows. - The crucial detail here is considering the centroid property and constructing mid-segments.

Given (DA = DB), (D) is the midpoint of (DA), and the median (DM) in the isosceles triangle (BDA) is also the altitude. Hence, (angle DMB = 90^circ). 5. Since (angle DHB = 90^circ) and (angle DMB = 90^circ), it follows that points (M, B, H,) and (D) lie on the same circle. 6.

By the properties of a quadrilateral, at least one of the internal angles must be at least ( 90^circ ). This means the corresponding robot cannot observe all the other robots, implying there must exist a pair of disconnected robots. 3. **Proof of ( N leq 468 ):** We will use a proof by contradiction. Suppose there are more than 468 observations. This implies there can be at most ( 24 cdot 23 - 469 = 83 ) pairs of disconnected robots, meaning there are a total of at most 166 disconnections, and a total of at least ( 24 cdot 23 - 166 = 386 ) connections. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a robot with at least ( leftlceil frac{386}{24} rightrceil = 17 ) connections. Let this robot be Robot-A, with ( 17 + a ) connections. 4. **Analyzing Set ( A ):** Consider the ( 17 + a ) robots that Robot-A is connected to, call this Set ( A ). Each of the other ( 7 - a ) robots outside Set ( A ) must have at least ( 6 - a ) disconnections. Thus, the ( 17 + a ) robots in Set ( A ) have at most ( 166 - (7 - a)(6 - a) ) total disconnections, meaning they have at least: [ (17 + a)(16 + a) - (166 - (7 - a)(6 - a)) = 148 + 2a^2 + 20a ] total connections. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these ( 17 + a ) robots has: [ frac{148 + 2a^2 + 20a}{17 + a} ] connections among the other robots in Set ( A ). Testing values, we find that ( frac{148 + 2a^2 + 20a}{17 + a} > 8 ) for all integers ( 0 leq a leq 6 ). Thus, there exists a robot in Set ( A ) with at least 9 connections among other robots in Set ( A ). Let this robot be Robot-B, with ( 9 + b ) connections. 5. **Analyzing Set ( B ):** Consider the ( 9 + b ) robots that Robot-B is connected to, call this Set ( B ). Each of the other ( 8 + a - b ) robots in Set ( A ) but outside Set ( B ) must have at least ( 14 - b ) disconnections. Thus, the ( 9 + b ) robots in Set ( B ) have at most: [ 83 - (8 + a - b)(14 - b) leq 83 - (8 - b)(14 - b) ] total disconnections, meaning they have at least: [ (9 + b)(8 + b) - (166 - (8 - b)(14 - b)) = 18 + 2b^2 - 5b ] total connections. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these ( 9 + b ) robots has: [ frac{18 + 2b^2 - 5b}{9 + b} ] connections among the other robots in Set ( B ). Testing values, we find that ( frac{18 + 2b^2 - 5b}{9 + b} > 1 ) for all integers ( 0 leq b leq 7 ). Thus, there exists at least one robot in Set ( B ) with at least 2 connections among other robots in Set ( B ). Let this robot be Robot-C, and let it be connected to Robot-D in Set ( B ). 6. **Contradiction:** Consider Robot-A, Robot-B, Robot-C, and Robot-D. We defined Robot-A to be connected to all elements of Set ( A ), which includes Robot-B, Robot-C, and Robot-D. We defined Robot-B to be connected to all elements of Set ( B ), which includes Robot-C and Robot-D. Finally, we defined Robot-C and Robot-D to be connected, which means every pair of these 4 robots is connected. However, this is a direct contradiction to Lemma 1, which states that among any four robots, at least one pair must be disconnected. Thus, our original supposition, \\"Suppose that there are more than 468 observations,\\" is impossible. We have proven there can be no more than 468 observations. 7. **Construction for ( N = 468 ):** Place 3 robots at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, with side-length say, 1000. Orient the robots such that they face directly at the center of the triangle. Place another three robots on the vertices of a smaller concentric triangle, with side-length 999. Again, make sure the robots face directly at the center of the triangle. Create 6 more smaller concentric triangles, in the same fashion (side lengths 998, 997, 996, etc.). At the end, we should have 3 lines of 8 robots each. This construction has the property that any robot in a given row observes all 16 of the robots in the two other rows. In addition, there are: [ binom{8}{2} ] observations within each row. This gives a total of: [ 24 cdot 16 + 3 cdot binom{8}{2} = 468 ] 8. **Summary:** We have proven that there can be no more than 468 observations, and we have shown a construction with exactly 468 observations.

This expression reaches its maximum value of sqrt{2} when x + frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2}, which implies x = frac{pi}{4}. 2. For the term sin y + 2cos y, we express it as sqrt{5} sin(y + alpha), where tan alpha = 2 and alpha in left(0, frac{pi}{2}right).

Therefore, we get sin x + cos x = 1. We can write sin(x + frac{pi}{2}) = cos x. Thus, cos(-x) = cos(x - pi) = -cos(x + frac{pi}{2}) = -left[1 - 2sin^2left(x + frac{pi}{2}right)right] = -left[1 - 2left(cos xright)^2right] = 2left(cos xright)^2 - 1. Let's introduce cos^2 x from the original equation m cdot n = sin xcos x + cos^2 x = 1. Hence, cos(-x) = 2(1 - sin x cos x) - 1 We need to find the expression for cos(-x) in terms of sin(x + frac{pi}{2}). We use that cos(-x) = cos x and since sin(x + frac{pi}{2}) = cos x, the equality becomes cos(-x) = 2left(cos x right)^2 - 1 = 2left(sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right)right)^2 - 1. Since cos(x) = sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right), cos^2(x) = sin^2left(x + frac{pi}{2}right), and so cos(-x) = 2sin^2left(x + frac{pi}{2}right) - 1 = 1 - 2sin^2 x. This simplifies to cos(-x) = 1 - 2sin x cos x using sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x. Substituting back sin x cos x + cos^2 x = 1, we find cos(-x) = 2cos^2 x - 1. Therefore, [boxed{cos(-x) = 2cos^2 x - 1}.] (2) Given that (2a - c)cos B = bcos C, by the Law of Sines we know (2sin A - sin C)cos B = sin B cos C. Expanding we get 2sin A cos B - sin C cos B = sin B cos C. Therefore, 2sin A cos B = sin(B + C). Since A + B + C = pi, sin(B + C) = sin A, and since sin A neq 0, we deduce that cos B = frac{1}{2}, and hence B = frac{pi}{3}, resulting in 0 < A < pi. Thus, -frac{pi}{2} < A - frac{pi}{3} < frac{pi}{2}, and 0 < sin(A + frac{pi}{3}) < 1. Also, since f(x) = m cdot n = sin(A + frac{pi}{3}) + cos^2 A, f(A) = sin(A + frac{pi}{3}) + cos^2 A. We now look to find the range of f(A). With 0 < sin(A + frac{pi}{3}) < 1 and 0 < A < pi, we have 0 < A + frac{pi}{3} < frac{4pi}{3}, which means the range of sin(A + frac{pi}{3}) is (0,1).

The cost price of x kg of the first variety of tea is 18x Rs, and the cost price of y kg of the second variety of tea is 20y Rs. The total cost price of the blended tea is therefore: Total Cost Price = 18x + 20y The selling price of the blended tea is Rs 21 per kg. If the producer gains 12%, then the cost price of the blended tea is 100% and the selling price is 112%. Let's denote the total weight of the blended tea as W kg (W = x + y). The selling price of W kg of the blended tea is: Selling Price = 21W Since the gain is 12%, the cost price of the blended tea is: Cost Price = Selling Price / 1.12 Substituting the selling price we get: Cost Price = (21W) / 1.12 Now, we can equate the total cost price with the cost price calculated from the gain percentage: 18x + 20y = (21W) / 1.12 Since W = x + y, we can substitute W in the equation: 18x + 20y = (21(x + y)) / 1.12 Multiplying both sides by 1.12 to get rid of the fraction, we get: 1.12(18x + 20y) = 21(x + y) Expanding the left side, we get: 20.16x + 22.4y = 21x + 21y Now, let's move the terms involving x and y to opposite sides to find the ratio: 20.16x - 21x = 21y - 22.4y This simplifies to: -0.84x = -1.4y Dividing both sides by -0.84, we get: x = (1.4/0.84)y Simplifying the fraction, we get: x = (5/3)y So the ratio in which he blends the two varieties of tea is x:y = boxed{5:3} ."},{"prompt":"Given a triangle ( ABC ) with the condition: [ cos (angle A angle B) + sin (angle A + angle B) = 2 ] Find the side ( BC ) if ( AB = 4 ).","completion":"To find the side ( BC ) in triangle ( ABC ) given that ( AB = 4 ) and the trigonometric identity: [ cos(angle A - angle B) + sin(angle A + angle B) = 2, ] we proceed with the following steps: 1. **Analyzing the Trigonometric Equality:** Each term, (cos(angle A - angle B)) and (sin(angle A + angle B)), reaches its maximum value of 1.

The condition 4 < m < n is given. 2. **Key Observations:** - A regular polygon has all its interior angles equal. - For a convex m-gon to have exactly two acute angles, these acute angles must be at consecutive vertices. If not, there would be two disjoint pairs of sides that take up more than half of the circle each, which is not possible. 3. **Fixing a Vertex:** Assume the last vertex, clockwise, of the four vertices that make up the two acute angles is fixed. This reduces the total number of regular m-gons by a factor of (2n+1), which we will later multiply back. 4. **Counting Arrangements:** - Suppose the larger arc that the first and the last of these four vertices make contains k points, and the other arc contains 2n-1-k points. - For each k, the vertices of the m-gon on the smaller arc can be arranged in binom{2n-1-k}{m-4} ways. - The two vertices on the larger arc can be arranged in (k-n)^2 ways (so that the two angles cut off more than half of the circle). 5. **Summing Over All k:** The total number of polygons given by k is thus (k-n)^2 times binom{2n-1-k}{m-4}.

The equation of the ellipse is frac{x^{2}}{16} + frac{y^{2}}{9} = 1. Comparing it with the standard form of an ellipse's equation (frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1), we can deduce that a=4 and b=3. 2. The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci (F_1 and F_2) remains constant and is equal to 2a (part of the definition of an ellipse). 3.

Inductive step: Next, we assume that for a particular (n), the following hold: [ a_{4k} equiv 0 pmod{3} ] We need to show that: [ a_{4(k+1)} equiv 0 pmod{3} ] We write: [ a_{4k+4} = a_{4k+3} + a_{4k+2} ] Using the Fibonacci sequence property, we unfold (a_{4k+4}): [ begin{aligned} a_{4k+4} &= a_{4k+3} + a_{4k+2} &= (a_{4k+2} + a_{4k+1}) + a_{4k+2} &= 2a_{4k+2} + a_{4k+1} &= 2(a_{4k+1} + a_{4k}) + a_{4k+1} &= 2a_{4k+1} + 2a_{4k} + a_{4k+1} &= 3a_{4k+1} + 2a_{4k} &= a_{4k} + 2 times (a_{4k+1} + a_{4k}) &= a_{4k} + 2 times (a_{4k} + a_{4k-1}) &= 3a_{4k} + 2a_{4k-1} end{aligned} ] Given (a_{4k}) is divisible by 3, it means: [ a_{4k} = 3m, quad text{for some integer} quad m ] Substituting (a_{4k} = 3m) in the above: [ a_{4k+4} = 3(3m) + 2a_{4k-1} = 3l ] Thus, (a_{4k+4}) is also divisible by 3. By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that every fourth term of the Fibonacci sequence is divisible by 3.

So, the cost of two adult tickets is 2 * 7.50 = 15. The cost of one child ticket is 4.25. So, the cost of four children's tickets is 4 * 4.25 = 17. The total cost of the tickets without any discount would be the cost of the adult tickets plus the cost of the children's tickets: 15 + 17 = 32.

She returned shirts priced at 20, 25, 30, 22, 23, and 29. We need to subtract these from the total list of shirt prices to find out the prices of the shirts she kept. The total list of shirt prices: 15, 18, 20, 15, 25, 30, 20, 17, 22, 23, and 29. The prices of the shirts she returned: 20, 25, 30, 22, 23, and 29. Now, let's subtract the returned shirts' prices from the total list to find the prices of the shirts she kept: Kept shirts' prices: 15, 18, 15, 20, 17. Now, let's add up the prices of the shirts she kept: 15 + 18 + 15 + 20 + 17 = 85. Before applying the discount and sales tax, the total cost of the shirts she kept is 85. Now, let's apply the 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of 85: Discount = 10% of 85 = 0.10 * 85 = 8.50. Subtract the discount from the total cost of the shirts she kept: 85 - 8.50 = 76.50. This is the discounted price before tax. Now, we need to calculate the sales tax, which is 8% of the discounted price: Sales tax = 8% of 76.50 = 0.08 * 76.50 = 6.12. Finally, let's add the sales tax to the discounted price to find the final total cost: Final total cost = 76.50 + 6.12 = 82.62.

Then, let point D lie on the segment A B_0. 2. **Symmetric Points and Initial Observations:** Let points A_0 and C_0 be the points of tangency of the incircle with sides BC and AB, respectively. Due to symmetry considerations regarding the angle bisectors, E is symmetric to D relative to the angle bisector of angle A, and F is symmetric to D relative to the angle bisector of angle C. 3. **Identifying the Locations:** Consequently, point E must lie on the extension of AC_{0}, and point F must lie on the extension of CA_{0}. This symmetry infers that E C_{0} = D B_{0} = FA_{0}. 4. **Introducing the Midpoint and Investigating the Geometry:** Let M be the midpoint of segment EF. We will demonstrate that M lies on the line A_{0}C_{0}. 5. **Use of Parallel Lines and Similarity of Triangles:** Mark point G on line A_{0}C_{0} so that segment FG is parallel to segment AB. As a result, triangles FGA_{0} and BCA_{0} are similar. Consequently, since BC_{0} = BA_{0}, we get FG = FA_{0} = EC_{0}. 6. **Applying Parallelism and Equiangularity:** Since FG and AB are parallel: [ angle FEC_{0} = angle EFG quad text{and} quad angle EC_{0}G = angle FGC_{0} ] 7. **Conclusion Through Triangle Congruence:** This shows that triangles EC_{0}M and FGM are congruent by the side-angle-side postulate (both possessing equal angles and the same length for their opposite sides): [ EC_{0} = FG, quad angle FEC_{0} = angle EFG, quad angle EC_{0}G = angle FGC_{0} ] 8. **Identifying M as the Midpoint:** As a result of this congruence, we obtain: [ EM = MF ] 9. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, the midpoint M of segment EF indeed lies on the line A_{0}C_{0}, connecting the tangency points of the incircle with sides BC and AB, respectively. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let A, B, C, D be four points in a plane, with A(1,3), B(2,2), C(4,1).

Therefore, the possible values of (c) are 1, 2, and 3. 5. **Case Analysis**: - If (c = 3), then: [ a + b = 7 - 3 = 4 ] Here, (a) and (b) should be such that (a + 3 > b) and (b + 3 > a). Thus, the pairs ((a, b)) can be: [ (1, 3), , (3, 1), , (2, 2) ] - If (c = 2), then: [ a + b = 7 - 2 = 5 ] Here, (a) and (b) should be such that (a + 2 > b) and (b + 2 > a).

The difference f(x_1) - f(x_2) can be expressed as: f(x_1) - f(x_2) = frac{x_1}{x_1^2+4} - frac{x_2}{x_2^2+4} = frac{x_1(x_2^2+4) - x_2(x_1^2+4)}{(x_1^2+4)(x_2^2+4)} = frac{(x_2-x_1)(x_1x_2-4)}{(x_1^2+4)(x_2^2+4)}. Since -2 < x_1 < x_2 < 2, we have x_2 - x_1 > 0 and x_1x_2 - 4 < 0 (because x_1x_2 < 4 in the given interval). Therefore, the product (x_2-x_1)(x_1x_2-4) < 0, which implies f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0 or equivalently f(x_1) < f(x_2). Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (-2,2). Part (3): Finding the Range of Real Number a Given f(a+1) - f(2a-1) > 0, and knowing f(x) is monotonically increasing, we have a+1 > 2a-1. Solving this inequality gives a < 2. Additionally, the conditions for a to be within the interval (-2,2) for both f(a+1) and f(2a-1) are: - -2 < a+1 < 2 which simplifies to -3 < a < 1. - -2 < 2a-1 < 2 which simplifies to -frac{1}{2} < a < frac{3}{2}.

Firstly, we notice that 0 is included in the second set, while the first set does not have any element equal to 0. So, based on the elements in the first set, we determine that a must be equal to 0. So, we have a = 0. However, since a appears as a denominator in frac{b}{a}, it cannot be 0 because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we need to match the elements differently. Next, we can see that 1 must correspond to a^2, which gives us a^2 = 1. This means that a could be 1 or -1. Since a cannot be 0, and we need a distinct set of elements, a = 1 is not viable as it would repeat the element 1 in the set. So, we conclude that a = -1. With a = -1, the element frac{b}{a} from the first set must equal to a + b in the second set. So, frac{b}{-1} = -1 + b. This simplifies to -b = -1 + b, which gives us 2b = 1, meaning b = frac{1}{2}. However, this does not satisfy the sets' equality when a = -1. Since we realized that b/(-1) = a+b, we made a mistake. When a = -1, this equality should be: frac{b}{-1} = -1 + b, which simplifies to -b = -1 + b, giving 2b = 1, which is incorrect because then b would not be 0 as previously stated. Therefore, we must re-evaluate our assumptions. Considering a^2 = 1, we get two possible values of a: 1 and -1. If we take a=1, then a^2 would not be distinct from the element 1 in the first set. Hence, a must be -1. Rearranging the given sets' elements, we can equate {1, -1, frac{b}{-1}} to {0, (-1)^2, -1 + b}. Since (-1)^2 = 1, which is already an element in the first set, then frac{b}{-1} must be 0. So, frac{b}{-1} = 0 implies b = 0.

This problem primarily assesses understanding of the standard form equation of a circle and methods to determine the relationship between two circles, making it an intermediate-level question."},{"prompt":"Given that the terminal side of angle theta passes through point P(4k, 3k) (k < 0), the value of 2sintheta + costheta is ( ) A: boxed{frac {2}{5}} B: boxed{frac {2}{5}} C: boxed{frac {2}{5}} or frac {2}{5} D: The value varies with different values of k","completion":"Since the terminal side of angle theta passes through point P(-4k, 3k), and (k < 0), the radius r = sqrt{(-4k)^{2}+(3k)^{2}} = 5|k| = -5k, thus, sintheta = frac{3k}{-5k} = -frac{3}{5}, and costheta = frac{-4k}{-5k} = frac{4}{5}, therefore, 2sintheta + costheta = 2left(-frac{3}{5}right) + frac{4}{5} = -frac{2}{5}.

Step 3: Setting up the problem Let us denote the boundary of the square by four line segments, and we parameterize each segment by its length from a starting corner. Suppose the first point is located at a distance x from the starting corner. We can compute the distance to the second point depending on its position relative to x. Step 4: Cases for distance calculation Let the first point be positioned at x, where (0 leq x leq 4) traversing the full perimeter of the square. The second point y can be anywhere on the boundary, so (0 leq y leq 4). We need to find the conditions under which (|x - y| geq frac{1}{2}).

We need to construct a great function ( f ) such that ( f(n, 0) = a_n ) and ( f(0, n) = b_n ) for all nonnegative integers ( n ). - **Base Case**: For ( P(0,0) ), we have: [ f(1,1) a_0 = 1 + a_1 b_1 ] Since ( a_0 mid 1 + a_1 b_1 ), there exists some ( f(1,1) in mathbb{Z} ) that satisfies this equation. - **Inductive Step**: Assume we have chosen ( f(1,1), ldots, f(n,1) ) such that ( P(0,0), P(1,0), ldots, P(n-1,0) ) are satisfied. We need to show that we can choose ( f(n+1,1) ) to satisfy ( P(n,0) ): [ f(n+1,1) a_n = 1 + a_{n+1} f(n,1) ] By the properties of ( a_n ), we can always find such an ( f(n+1,1) ). - **Symmetry and Extension**: Similarly, we can choose ( f(1,1), f(1,2), ldots ) such that ( P(0,1), P(0,2), ldots ) are satisfied. This process can be extended to all ( (m,n) ) by induction on ( min{m,n} ). 3. **Prove ( A sim B implies A approx B )**: Suppose ( A sim B ). Then there exists a great function ( f ) such that ( f(n, 0) = a_n ) and ( f(0, n) = b_n ). - From ( P(0,0) ): [ f(1,1) a_0 = 1 + a_1 b_1 ] which implies ( a_0 mid 1 + a_1 b_1 ). - From ( P(n-1,0) ) and ( P(n-2,0) ): [ f(n,1) a_{n-1} a_{n-2} = a_{n-2} + a_n a_{n-1} f(n-2,1) ] This implies ( a_{n-1} mid a_n + a_{n-2} ) and similarly for ( b_n ). 4. **Transitivity of ( approx )**: If ( A approx B ), ( B approx C ), and ( C approx D ), then ( D approx A ). - For ( x = a_0 = b_0 = c_0 = d_0 ): - If ( x = 0 ): [ a_1 b_1 = b_1 c_1 = c_1 d_1 = -1 ] implies ( a_1 d_1 = -1 ). - If ( x = 1 ): [ x mid 1 + a_1 d_1 ] - If ( |x| ge 2 ): [ a_1 b_1 equiv b_1 c_1 equiv c_1 d_1 equiv -1 pmod{x} ] implies ( a_1 d_1 equiv -1 pmod{x} ). - For ( a_k mid a_{k-1} + a_{k+1} ) and ( d_k mid d_{k-1} + d_{k+1} ), we have ( D approx A ).

Substituting the distances we have: - 5t + t = 6t = 2a, which simplifies to a = 3t. 3. **Finding |PF_{1}|**: The distance from P to F_{1} can be found by subtracting |PF_{2}| from the total length of the major axis, 2a: - |PF_{1}| = 2a - |PF_{2}| = 6t - 3t = 3t. 4. **Determining the Right Angle**: By applying the Pythagorean theorem, we see that |PQ|^2 + |PF_{1}|^2 = |F_{1}Q|^2. Substituting the values we have: - (4t)^2 + (3t)^2 = (5t)^2, which confirms that angle F_{1}PQ = 90^{circ}. This means PF_{1} perp PF_{2}. 5. **Calculating the Area of triangle QF_{1}F_{2}**: The area of triangle QF_{1}F_{2} can be found by subtracting the area of triangle F_{1}PF_{2} from the area of triangle F_{1}PQ: - {S}_{triangle Q{F}_{1}{F}_{2}} = frac{1}{2} times |PF_{1}| times |PQ| - frac{1}{2} times |PF_{1}| times |PF_{2}| = frac{1}{2} times 3t times 4t - frac{1}{2} times 3t times 3t = frac{3}{2}t^2. - Since a = 3t, substituting t = frac{a}{3} into the area formula gives {S}_{triangle Q{F}_{1}{F}_{2}} = frac{3}{2} left(frac{a}{3}right)^2 = frac{a^2}{6}. Therefore, the area of triangle QF_{1}F_{2} is boxed{frac{a^2}{6}}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"Determine under what condition the expressions a+2bc and (a+b)(a+2c) are equal for any constant k.

Setting these equal gives us: sin Cleft(sin Acos B-cos Asin Bright) = sin Bleft(sin Ccos A-cos Csin Aright). Rearranging terms, we find: sin Asin Bcos C + sin Acos Bsin C = 2cos Asin Bsin C.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ( OA_1A_4 ): [ b^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2R^2 cos 108^circ ] Since ( cos 108^circ = -cos 72^circ ), we have: [ b^2 = 2R^2 (1 + cos 72^circ) ] Using ( cos 72^circ = sin 18^circ = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4} ), we get: [ b^2 = 2R^2 left(1 + frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4}right) = 2R^2 left(frac{4 + sqrt{5} - 1}{4}right) = 2R^2 left(frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{4}right) = frac{2R^2 (3 + sqrt{5})}{4} = frac{R^2 (3 + sqrt{5})}{2} ] 6. Solving for ( b ), we get: [ b = R sqrt{frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}} ] 7. Using the relationship ( s = frac{R}{cos 36^circ} ) and knowing that ( cos 36^circ = frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4} ), we have: [ s = frac{R}{frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4}} = frac{4R}{sqrt{5} + 1} ] 8. Simplifying ( frac{4R}{sqrt{5} + 1} ) by rationalizing the denominator: [ s = frac{4R (sqrt{5} - 1)}{(sqrt{5} + 1)(sqrt{5} - 1)} = frac{4R (sqrt{5} - 1)}{5 - 1} = frac{4R (sqrt{5} - 1)}{4} = R (sqrt{5} - 1) ] 9. Since ( b = R sqrt{frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}} ), we need to find the relationship between ( b ) and ( s ). Given that ( s = R (sqrt{5} - 1) ), we can see that: [ s = b - R ] Therefore, the length of a side of the decagon is ( boxed{b - R} )."},{"prompt":"The parabola y=x^{2}+4x+5m intersects the xaxis at only one point. The condition that m satisfies is ______.","completion":"To find the condition that m satisfies for the parabola y=x^{2}+4x+5-m to intersect the x-axis at only one point, we follow these steps: 1. Recognize that for a parabola to intersect the x-axis at only one point, it must have a single, repeated real root. This means the discriminant (Delta) of the quadratic equation x^{2}+4x+5-m=0 must be equal to zero. 2. The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac.

For a given temperature and pressure, the number of moles ( n ) of gas in a fixed volume ( V ) is constant. 2. **Comparing Moist Air and Dry Air**: Both moist air and dry air are assumed to be at the same temperature and pressure. Therefore, according to the ideal gas law, they will contain the same number of moles of gas in a given volume. 3. **Molar Mass Consideration**: Dry air is primarily composed of nitrogen ((ce{N2})) and oxygen ((ce{O2})), with molar masses of approximately 28 g/mol and 32 g/mol, respectively. Moist air contains water vapor ((ce{H2O})), which has a molar mass of approximately 18 g/mol. 4. **Density Calculation**: Density ((rho)) is defined as mass per unit volume. For a given number of moles ( n ) in a fixed volume ( V ), the mass ( m ) of the gas is given by: [ m = n cdot M ] where ( M ) is the molar mass of the gas. Therefore, the density is: [ rho = frac{m}{V} = frac{n cdot M}{V} ] Since ( n ) and ( V ) are the same for both moist air and dry air, the density is directly proportional to the molar mass ( M ). 5. **Conclusion**: Because water vapor ((ce{H2O})) has a lower molar mass (18 g/mol) compared to nitrogen ((ce{N2})) and oxygen ((ce{O2})), the presence of water vapor in moist air reduces the average molar mass of the air mixture. Consequently, moist air has a lower density than dry air.
