Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","completion":"Given the extensive information provided, your document seems to be a research paper titled \\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking,\\" authored by Eric Zelikman and colleagues from Stanford University alongside contributors from Notbad AI Inc. This paper introduces an advanced technique aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models without explicit task-specific training. Here's a simplified overview of the core aspects covered in your document: # What is \\"Quiet-STaR\\"? - Quiet-STaR stands for \\"Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner.\\" - It's a technique designed for language models, enabling them to generate internal thoughts or rationales that help improve their predictions on future text output. This is akin to how humans sometimes pause to think or plan their next words based on context. - The method builds upon the idea that reasoning, or the thought process happening beneath the surface of communication, is crucial for understanding and generating coherent text. # How Does It Work? Quiet-STaR operates through a distinctive three-step process during model training: 1. **Think**: The model generates thoughts in parallel after every token. These are not external predictions but internal conjectures about what comes next based on the current context. 2. **Talk**: Based on these generated thoughts, the model either moves forward with making a prediction or adjusts its thought process. It learns to balance between its initial prediction and its \\"thought\\" to make the next move. 3. **Learn**: The model is trained using a reinforcement approach, essentially rewarding thoughts that lead to more accurate predictions or useful outcomes. This step iterates over the process, allowing the model to adapt and improve its reasoning capabilities over time. # Benefits and Innovations - **Efficient Reasoning**: By generating and utilizing internal thoughts, the model learns to reason more effectively, improving its ability to handle complex language tasks without direct instruction on those tasks. - **Adaptable Learning**: Quiet-STaR allows models to adapt their learning process based on the richness and complexity of tasks present in natural language, providing a scalable approach to enhancing their reasoning capabilities. - **Generality**: This approach aims to teach models general reasoning skills that can be applied across various tasks, moving beyond task-specific learning models. # Testing and Results The document details experiments that demonstrate how Quiet-STaR improves model performance on reasoning tasks. It shows significant improvements in language tasks that traditionally require intricate reasoning, such as question-answering and mathematical problem-solving. # Ethical Consideration and Future Directions The paper acknowledges potential ethical concerns related to model reasoning and the accuracy of generated reasoning processes. It also outlines future research directions, including exploring dynamic rationale generation and extending this approach to larger models for improved reasoning capabilities."},{"prompt":"given x1 = e^t [(cos(4t) - 3sin(4t)), (2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t))] is a solution to x' = Ax, find the solution with x(0) = [(7), (-2)]","completion":"Given the system (x' = Ax), where a specific solution is [ x_1 = e^t begin{bmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{bmatrix}, ] we need to find the solution (x(t)) that satisfies the initial condition (x(0) = begin{bmatrix} 7 -2 end{bmatrix}). Let's start by setting up our solution. Generally, for a system (x' = Ax), if we have a complex solution of the form (e^{lambda t}[cos(mu t) mathbf{v}_1 + sin(mu t) mathbf{v}_2]), where (mathbf{v_1}) and (mathbf{v_2}) are real vector constants, we can build a general solution from linear combinations of such solutions. For our particular solution, [ x_1 = e^t begin{bmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{bmatrix} ] it suggests that candidates for (mathbf{v}_1) and (mathbf{v}_2) are involved, with (lambda = 1) and (mu = 4). Here, (mathbf{v}_1 = begin{bmatrix} 1 2 end{bmatrix}) and (mathbf{v}_2 = begin{bmatrix} -3 2 end{bmatrix}), thus decomposing (x_1) into its real and imaginary part (so to speak), even though it's all real due to sine and cosine involvement. Given the initial condition (x(0) = begin{bmatrix} 7 -2 end{bmatrix}), let's note: At (t = 0), (cos(0) = 1) and (sin(0) = 0), so [ x_1(0) = e^0 begin{bmatrix} 1 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 1 2 end{bmatrix} ] Given only (x1), it seems we may only have this solution directly related. However, generally, there would be (x2) part of the solution too if we were to decompose or find solutions based on Eigenvalues or say a multi-dimensional complex solution. For the given (x1), if it's the sole basis for our solution space, we aim to scale and shift this function to meet our initial conditions. However, in the format provided, without a second independent solution (which typically would exist in such systems), we directly work only with what's given. Since we're asked to determine a specific solution without further details on the entire solution space or a method to derive it (like Eigenvalues or Eigenvectors provided directly or methodology), and the question seems to point towards utilizing just the provided specific solution to meet initial conditions, I'll clarify fundamentally how one might approach the continuity in such scenarios with this being the direct solution: Given (x_1 = e^t begin{bmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{bmatrix}), if treated as a component of a fundamental set of solutions, we would normally consider linear combinations of independent solutions to meet the initial conditions (x(0) = begin{bmatrix} 7 -2 end{bmatrix}). Ideally, this would involve setting up equations from the initial condition that match a linear combination of solutions at (t=0) to the provided initial vectors. However, without an explicit couple (second linearly independent solution), we focus on what scaling or direct transformation could lead us from our known (x_1(0)) to the desired (x(0)). Directly, based on the information given, (x_1) uniquely doesn't scale to the initial condition (x(0)) without considering the possibility of a missing piece or a mathematical misinterpretation of the provided structure. For educational or conjectural works, verification would require revisiting the system's derivation, the second solution, or reconstructing assumptions about the provided dynamics or solving approach (e.g., Eigen decomposition)."},{"prompt":"One of the strongest arguments that proponents of the New Deal make was that it saved Depression-plagued America from the radical right-wing or left-wing dictatorships that seized power in much of Europe.

However, it is worth considering the historical context of the time. During the Great Depression, there was certainly a rise in extremist ideologies in the United States, as evidenced by the popularity of figures like Father Coughlin and the growth of organizations like the Silver Legion of America (the Silver Shirts) and the American Nazi Party. Additionally, there were also communist sympathizers and organizers who sought to promote socialist ideals and challenge the capitalist system. While these movements did exist, it is debated how much of a threat they posed to the democratic system in the U.S. Some argue that the American political and social institutions were strong enough to resist any potential slide into authoritarianism, while others suggest that without the New Deal and Roosevelt's leadership, the country could have been more susceptible to radical ideologies. Ultimately, it is difficult to predict what could have happened if the New Deal had not been implemented or if Roosevelt had failed. However, many historians argue that the policies of the New Deal did help to stabilize the economy, provide relief to those suffering from the effects of the Depression, and prevent the rise of extremist movements in the U.S. This in turn may have helped to preserve American democracy during a turbulent time in history."},{"prompt":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man writing a essay on why Twilight is better than 50 Shades of Grey.

And why does it look like you raided a costume shop's clearance bin? BOB (enthused) I'm writing the ultimate defense for why \\"Twilight\\" is a million times better than \\"50 Shades of Grey\\". It's for my Lit class. This cape gives me strength. DAVE (raising an eyebrow) Twilight? Really? Isn't that for teenage girls? BOB (indignantly) I'll have you know, Dave, \\"Twilight\\" transcends age and gender. It's a saga of love, choice, and facing one's demons — both metaphorical and literal. Besides, Bella making the choice to become a vampire is the ultimate act of agency. She chose power, immortality, and love. What does \\"50 Shades\\" offer? Elevators and bad contracts? Dave, clearly amused, decides to play along. DAVE I guess I haven't looked at it that way. But Bob, how will you convince your professor? BOB Easy. Exhibit A: Vampires. Exhibit B: Werewolves. Exhibit C: A love that withstands immortal odds. What does \\"50 Shades\\" have? A guy who's too into his own hardware store purchases. DAVE (laughing) Can't argue with that logic. Bob, feeling inspired, types even more furiously. Dave shakes his head, smiling, and grabs a gaming controller. DAVE Well, while you save Bella's honor, I'll be in the living room. Don't stay up too late with your vampire buddies. BOB (saluting with a determined expression) No promises, Dave. This essay will be my magnum opus. For Bella. For Edward. For every misunderstood vampire out there. Dave exits, still chuckling as Bob turns back to his laptop, passionate and undeterred. He begins to passionately argue about the depth of Bella and Edward's relationship compared to the shallow dynamics of \\"50 Shades.\\" Fade to black as Bob's typing becomes a fervent cacophony, intermixed with passionate mutterings about true love, vampire rights, and the importance of well-written characters. The night wears on, a testament to one man's love for a tale of vampires and forbidden love. END SCENE"},{"prompt":"One of the strongest arguments that proponents of the New Deal make was that it saved Depression-plagued America from the radical right-wing or left-wing dictatorships that seized power in much of Europe. Was the United States ever in danger of turning to fascism or communism if there had been no New Deal or if Roosevelt and his policies had failed? Take a side, answer very shortly.","completion":"No, the United States was not in danger of turning to fascism or communism even without the New Deal. The American political system and society were fundamentally different from those in Europe, making such extreme ideologies less likely to take hold."},{"prompt":"Create a picture about a tree with a monkey","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't directly create or display images. However, I can guide you on how to draw a picture of a tree with a monkey in it. Here's a step-by-step description you can follow: # What You'll Need - Paper - Pencil - Eraser - Coloring tools (optional) # Drawing the Tree 1. **Start with the Trunk**: Draw a wide base that narrows as you go up, making the trunk slightly curved for a natural look. 2. **Add Tree Texture**: Add vertical lines along the trunk to create the tree bark texture. 3. **Sketch the Branches**: From the top and sides of the trunk, extend out several branches. Make them fork out in different directions and taper to a point. 4. **Leaves and Canopy**: On the branches, draw clusters of leaves. You can do this by sketching cloud-like shapes for a fuller look. Make sure the canopy is dense and lively. # Drawing the Monkey 1. **Shape the Body**: On one of the branches, sketch an oval for the monkey’s body, and a smaller circle for its head. 2. **Facial Features**: On the circle (head), draw two small eyes, a little nose, and a curved line for the mouth. Add little arcs above the eyes for eyebrows. 3. **Limbs**: Draw two long, curved arms extending from the sides of the body. Remember, monkeys have very flexible limbs, so one arm can be reaching out or hanging down. Add two legs, showing the monkey sitting or crouching on the branch. 4. **Tail**: Add a long, curved tail that loops around the branch or hangs down artistically. 5. **Details**: Give the monkey some fingers and toes to cling onto the branch, and don’t forget the monkey’s ears on the sides of its head. # Final Touches - Add some texture to the monkey’s fur by drawing short strokes along its body. - You can add more elements to the background, like more trees, birds, or even a setting sun. - Once you’re satisfied with your drawing, you can go over it with a pen or marker and erase any unnecessary pencil marks. - Coloring the drawing adds more life to it. Give the tree green leaves, a brown trunk, and color the monkey accordingly, depending on its species. And voila, you now have a completed picture of a tree with a monkey! Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't exactly how you want it. Keep practicing!"},{"prompt":"GPT-4 Turbo: Research Preview (128K token limit, Short-Term Availability) If this app doesn't respond, it's likely due to our API key hitting the daily limit of our organization.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18).

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","completion":"This complex discussion centers on a technique known as Quiet-STaR for extracting \\"LoRA adapters\\" from pre-trained machine learning models for more efficient fine-tuning on new tasks. LoRA, or Low-rank Adaptation, is a method for adapting neural network models with minimal additional computation, allowing for task-specific adjustments without fully retraining the model. This is particularly useful for models that have been extensively trained on large datasets and for which retraining is computationally expensive. The process involves several key steps: 1. **Setting Up**: The environment is prepared with necessary software libraries. Two models are identified: a base model from which adaptations will be extracted, and a target model that has been fine-tuned from the base model for a specific task. 2. **Model Download**: Utility functions are defined for downloading these models from Hugging Face Hub, favoring models saved in a more efficient format when available. 3. **Identifying Relevant Layers**: The layers within the transformer models that are relevant for LoRA adapters are identified. These are typically the linear and embedding layers where adaptations can have the most significant impact. 4. **Decomposing Weights**: The core technical contribution of the technique is the decomposition of differences in weights (delta weights) between the base and target models into low-rank matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This allows representing the changes needed to adapt the base model to perform like the target model in a more parameter-efficient way. 5. **Storing and Applying LoRA Adapters**: The decomposed weights are saved, and a configuration for applying these adapters to the base model is created. This essentially modifies the base model to behave like the target model for specific tasks without the need for extensive retraining. 6. **Evaluation and Sharing**: The modified base model is assessed to ensure it behaves similarly to the target model when generating responses. The configuration for applying the LoRA adapters, along with any extracted adapters, can then be uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub for others to use. This method appreciates the efficiency in adapting large, pre-trained models to new tasks without the need for extensive computational resources. It leverages the underlying structure of the models and the specific adaptations learned during fine-tuning, preserving the intricate relationships learned through initial training while introducing task-specific nuances."},{"prompt":"Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant.

Continuer nécessite de la planification, de la conception, et une implementation bien réfléchies des fonctionnalités. Comme ce projet est hypothétique et destiné à titre d'apprentissage, il convient de noter que des décisions de conception spécifiques, des gestionnaires d'état (comme Svelte stores ou RecoilJS si vous mélangez avec React), et une authentification sécurisée sont critiques pour un projet réel. # Étape 5: Intégration de l'API pour le service de messagerie 1. **Choisissez une API de service de messagerie**: Par exemple, si vous utilisez Gmail, vous auriez besoin d'intégrer l'API Gmail. Cela nécessitera de configurer un projet dans Google Cloud Platform, de créer des identifiants OAuth 2.0, et d'intégrer l'SDK Google API dans votre application. 2. **Authentification**: Utilisez OAuth 2.0 pour l'authentification avec le service de messagerie choisi. L'authentification se fait généralement via une fenêtre de navigateur séparée qui demande à l'utilisateur d'accorder des permissions à votre application. 3. **Fetch et Envoi des E-mails**: Après l'authentification, utilisez l'API du service de messagerie pour fetch les e-mails de l'utilisateur et permettre l'envoi de nouveaux e-mails. Vous aurez à traiter des réponses JSON, les décomposer et les afficher dans votre UI. # Étape 6: Amélioration de l'interface utilisateur (UI) Cette étape comprend la conception de l'interface pour l'affichage de la liste des e-mails, la lecture d'un e-mail spécifique, et la composition de nouveaux e-mails. Implémentez des fonctionnalités supplémentaires comme la recherche et le filtrage des e-mails. 1. **Liste des Emails**: Créez une vue qui liste tous les e-mails. Utilisez \`fetch\` avec sa méthode appropriée pour récupérer les e-mails auprès de l'API et les afficher. 2. **Lecture et Envoi d'E-mails**: Permettez aux utilisateurs de cliquer sur un e-mail pour le lire dans une nouvelle vue et de composer puis envoyer des e-mails depuis une autre vue. # Étape 7: Sécurité et Stockage Local La gestion des données d'authentification et le stockage local sécurisé des données sensibles sont cruciaux. 1. **Stockage Sécurisé**: Tauri offre des fonctionnalités de stockage sécurisé pour les jetons d'authentification et autres données sensibles. Assurez-vous de les utiliser pour protéger les informations de l'utilisateur. 2. **Refresh Tokens**: Implémentez une logique pour rafraîchir les tokens d'accès de manière transparente pour l'utilisateur, garantissant que les sessions ne se terminent pas de manière inattendue. # Étape 8: Packaging et Distribution Une fois votre application développée et testée, utilisez les outils fournis par Tauri pour empaqueter votre application pour différentes plateformes (Windows, MacOS, Linux). 1. **Packaging**: Suivez la documentation de Tauri pour packager votre application. Cela implique généralement l'exécution d'une suite de commandes pour créer des builds pour les plateformes ciblées. 2. **Testez Votre Application**: Avant la distribution, assurez-vous de tester l'application sur différentes plateformes pour identifier et résoudre les problèmes de compatibilité ou de performance. # Conclusion et Ressources Cette exploration vous donne une vue d'ensemble de la manière d'approcher le développement d'une application de messagerie minimaliste utilisant Svelte et Tauri.

Cela peut être utile pour effectuer des opérations plus complexes ou pour accéder à des fonctionnalités du système d'exploitation qui ne sont pas exposées par les API JavaScript. 1. **Définir une Commande en Rust** Dans le fichier \`src-tauri/src/main.rs\` : \`\`\`rust #[tauri::command] fn my_custom_command(message: String) { println!(\\"Message reçu de Tauri: {}\\", message); } fn main() { tauri::Builder::default() .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![my_custom_command]) .run(tauri::generate_context!()) .expect(\\"error while running tauri application\\"); } \`\`\` 2. **Appeler la Commande depuis Svelte/JavaScript** Utilisez le module \`@tauri-apps/api/tauri\` pour appeler la commande. \`\`\`javascript import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/tauri'; async function callRustCommand() { try { await invoke('my_custom_command', { message: 'Hello from JavaScript' }); console.log('Commande exécutée avec succès.'); } catch (error) { console.error('Erreur lors de l'appel de la commande Rust', error); } } \`\`\` # Conclure Félicitations ! Vous avez maintenant une compréhension de base de la façon de commencer à créer une application Tauri avec un frontend Svelte, y compris la manière d'interagir avec le système de fichiers et d'exécuter des commandes personnalisées. Tout en étant une vue d'ensemble plutôt qu'un tutoriel détaillé complet, ce guide devrait vous donner un bon point de départ pour explorer plus avant les possibilités qu'offrent Svelte et Tauri ensemble. Explorant davantage les fonctionnalités de Tauri, consultez la [documentation officielle de Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/all-features/) pour une couverture complète de ce que vous pouvez faire avec ce framework excitant. Bon développement !"},{"prompt":"fait une intégration avec gmail","completion":"L'intégration avec Gmail pour une application de bureau développée avec Tauri et Svelte est une tâche relativement avancée. Elle nécessite d'authentifier les utilisateurs via OAuth2, de récupérer les tokens d'accès, et de les utiliser pour faire des requêtes à l'API Gmail. **Note importante**: L'intégration OAuth2 dans une application de bureau peut être complexe notamment en raison des besoins en sécurité et des politiques strictes de Google concernant les flux OAuth pour les applications de bureau. # Étapes générales pour l'intégration Gmail 1. **Créer un projet dans Google Cloud Platform**: - Rendez-vous dans [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). - Créez un nouveau projet. - Accédez à \\"APIs & Services\\" > \\"OAuth consent screen\\" et configurez l'écran de consentement. - Dans \\"Credentials\\", créez des identifiants OAuth2 pour obtenir votre \`Client ID\` et \`Client Secret\`. 2. **Implémentation de l'authentification OAuth2 dans votre application Tauri**: - Implémenter un flux d'authentification OAuth2 peut être assez délicat, surtout pour s'assurer que cela est fait de manière sécurisée. - Vous devrez ouvrir un navigateur externe pour que l'utilisateur puisse se connecter à son compte Google et consentir à votre application d'accéder à ses données Gmail. - Google renverra un code d'authentification qui sera échangé contre un token d'accès à utiliser avec l'API Gmail. 3. **Utiliser l'API Gmail**: - Une fois authentifié, vous pouvez utiliser le token d'accès pour faire des requêtes à l'API Gmail, par exemple pour lister les e-mails, lire des e-mails spécifiques, envoyer des e-mails, etc. # Exemple code pour une intégration de base Cet exemple illustre uniquement ce à quoi ressembleraient les appels à l'API depuis le côté JavaScript de l'application, en supposant que l'authentification OAuth2 a déjà été gérée et que vous avez un token d'accès valide. **Lister les E-mails avec l'API Gmail**: \`\`\`javascript async function listEmails() { const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'; // Remplacez avec un vrai token d'accès try { const response = await fetch('https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages', { headers: { Authorization: \`Bearer {accessToken}\`, }, }); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(\`Error: {response.status}\`); } const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); } catch (error) { console.error('Failed to fetch emails', error); } } \`\`\` # Notes de sécurité - **Sécurité de l'authentification**: Lors de l'implémentation de l'authentification OAuth2, assurez-vous de sécuriser les tokens d'accès et les identifiants client. Ne les exposez jamais dans votre frontend et utilisez des échanges de code sécurisés. - **Stockage sécurisé des tokens**: Les tokens d'accès et de rafraîchissement doivent être stockés de manière sécurisée. Tauri offre des mécanismes pour sécuriser ces informations sensibles. # Conclusion Comme vous pouvez le voir, intégrer une application Tauri/Svelte avec l'API Gmail est un processus qui implique plusieurs étapes et une préoccupation sérieuse pour la sécurité et l'authentification des utilisateurs. Bien que ce guide fournisse une vue d'ensemble de haut niveau de cette intégration, chaque application peut avoir des exigences et des complexités uniques. Pour une application réelle, vous devrez plonger plus profondément dans les documentations de Google OAuth2, Gmail API, et Tauri pour assurer que vous respectez toutes les meilleures pratiques en matière de sécurité et d'expérience utilisateur."},{"prompt":"Assume this is a code I wrote in google colab: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- \\"\\"\\"test_model.ipynb Automatically generated by Colaboratory.

Creating a professional GitHub repository not only makes your project more accessible and usable to others, but it also demonstrates your capabilities in software development and open-source contributions."},{"prompt":"Now create a comprehensive code that generartes audio from text using audio diffusion models","completion":"Creating audio from text using audio diffusion models involves several components, including text-to-speech (TTS) to convert the text into speech and then, optionally, applying audio transformation or enhancement through an audio diffusion model for unique effects. Since ready-made, comprehensive solutions for using audio diffusion directly on text are limited and highly specialized, we'll outline a simplified, conceptual approach here. The process can be broken up into two main parts: 1. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert the input text into speech/audio. This could be achieved using various TTS libraries or APIs, such as \`gTTS\` (Google Text-to-Speech), which is a simple, accessible choice. 2. **Audio Processing**: Process the generated audio using an audio diffusion model to achieve desired effects, enhancements, or transformations. This part is more experimental and depends on the availability and capabilities of audio diffusion models. # Step 1: Text-to-Speech using gTTS \`gTTS\` provides a way to convert text into audio using Google's Text-to-Speech API. First, you'll need to install \`gTTS\` and an audio library to play the audio, like \`pydub\`. \`\`\`bash pip install gTTS pydub \`\`\` The following Python script demonstrates how to convert text to audio and save the audio file: \`\`\`python from gtts import gTTS from pydub import AudioSegment from pydub.playback import play import os def text_to_speech(text, lang='en'): tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=lang) output_file = \\"output.mp3\\" tts.save(output_file) return output_file def play_audio(file_path): audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(file_path) play(audio) # Example usage text = \\"Hello, welcome to our audio diffusion demonstration.\\" audio_file_path = text_to_speech(text) print(\\"Playing generated audio...\\") play_audio(audio_file_path) \`\`\` # Step 2: Processing Audio with an Audio Diffusion Model Next, you would process the generated audio file from the TTS phase using an audio diffusion model. Since most audio diffusion models work with specific data types or formats, and there's a variety of potential models (each with its own APIs and expected inputs), this step is more conceptual. You would need a trained audio diffusion model or a platform that provides access to such models. Then, load your audio file, convert it to the required format (e.g., a spectrogram), and process it through the model. # Note Due to the complexity and variety of audio diffusion models and the lack of a standardized, easily accessible API for audio generation, integrating an audio diffusion model directly into this script goes beyond a general example and would require specific details about the model being used, including its input and output format, library dependencies, and runtime environment. Exploration in this area often involves profound research and experimentation, especially if looking to push the boundaries of audio generation quality or achieve particular effects. Advanced users might delve into recent academic papers or repositories on platforms like GitHub to find cutting-edge models and techniques, bridging the gap between TTS and sophisticated audio processing. # Final Thoughts While the above provides a starting point for generating and playing text-based audio, incorporating an audio diffusion model effectively requires more specific model details. As the field evolves, we may see more integrated solutions that streamline this process."},{"prompt":"Make sure the code works end to end in a notebook","completion":"Certainly! To provide an end-to-end working example in a notebook, I'll simplify the process into the following steps, focusing on text-to-speech using \`gTTS\` for its simplicity and accessibility. For the audio diffusion part, due to the complexity and the specificity required by most diffusion models, I'll guide you through generating and playing back speech from text, given the broad and experimental nature of integrating audio diffusion directly. Let's focus on setting up a Google Colab notebook that converts text to speech as an illustrative starting point. # Google Colab Notebook Setup First, you'll need to install dependencies. Paste the following commands into the first cell of your Colab notebook to install the \`gTTS\` library for text-to-speech conversion and \`ffmpeg-python\` to handle audio files: \`\`\`python !pip install gTTS ffmpeg-python \`\`\` Next, create a function to convert text to speech and save it as an audio file. Add this in the next cell: \`\`\`python from gtts import gTTS import IPython.display as ipd def text_to_speech(text, lang='en'): \\"\\"\\"Converts text to speech and plays the audio.\\"\\"\\" tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=lang) output_file = \\"/content/output.mp3\\" tts.save(output_file) return output_file text = \\"Hello, welcome to our demonstration. This is an example of text converted to speech.\\" output_mp3 = text_to_speech(text) \`\`\` Finally, to play the generated audio directly within the Colab notebook, use the \`IPython.display.Audio\` function. Paste the following code in another cell: \`\`\`python ipd.Audio(output_mp3) \`\`\` Running these cells in sequence will convert the specified text to speech, save it as an MP3 file, and play it back directly in your Colab notebook. # Extensions and Limitations This example provides a starting point for text-to-speech generation in a Colab notebook. Integrating an audio diffusion model to further process the generated speech is a more complex and specialized task. It involves: 1. **Model Selection:** Identifying a suitable audio diffusion model that fits your project goals. 2. **Data Preparation:** Converting the TTS-generated audio into a format accepted by the diffusion model. 3. **Model Integration:** Running the prepared audio through the audio diffusion model to apply the desired effects or transformations. 4. **Output Handling:** Converting the model's output back into an audio format and evaluating the results. Each of these steps requires careful consideration of the model's capabilities, data formats, and computational requirements. Advanced use cases may also involve fine-tuning the model on specific datasets, which adds additional complexity. # Conclusion The above guide provides a straightforward approach to generating speech from text in a Colab notebook, suitable for demonstrations or initial explorations of TTS. Integrating audio diffusion for advanced audio processing opens up exciting possibilities but requires a deeper dive into specific models and more complex implementation."},{"prompt":"Create a comprehesive gihub repo with code and showcase your deep knowledge in audio diffusion models","completion":"Creating a GitHub repository that showcases a deep understanding of audio diffusion models involves several steps, from planning the repository structure to creating detailed documentation and examples. This guide will provide a framework for setting up such a repository, focusing on clarity, comprehensiveness, and ease of use for the community. # Step 1: Plan the Repository Structure Your repository should be structured in a way that is immediately understandable to new users, yet comprehensive enough for advanced developers. A potential structure might look like this: \`\`\` audio-diffusion-exploration/ ├── notebooks/ │ ├── TextToSpeechAudioDiffusion.ipynb │ └── AdvancedAudioEffects.ipynb ├── src/ │ ├── audio_diffusion/ │ │ ├── __init__.py │ │ ├── models.py │ │ ├── transforms.py │ │ └── utils.py │ ├── tts/ │ │ ├── __init__.py │ │ └── gTTS_wrapper.py ├── examples/ │ ├── simple_example.mp3 │ └── transformed_example.mp3 ├── requirements.txt ├── LICENSE └── README.md \`\`\` # Step 2: Populate the Repository 1. **Notebooks**: Create Jupyter notebooks (\`TextToSpeechAudioDiffusion.ipynb\`, \`AdvancedAudioEffects.ipynb\`) that provide a tutorial-like exploration of text-to-speech and audio diffusion models. These should include commentary on what each section does, why certain choices were made, and what results to expect. 2. **Source Code**: The \`src\` directory contains your project's Python code. - In the \`audio_diffusion\` subdirectory, place the source code related to the audio diffusion model such as model definitions (\`models.py\`), data transforms (\`transforms.py\`), and utility functions (\`utils.py\`). - The \`tts\` subdirectory could contain wrappers or utility functions around TTS libraries, such as a custom wrapper for \`gTTS\` (\`gTTS_wrapper.py\`) that integrates seamlessly with your audio processing pipeline. 3. **Examples**: Include audio examples (\`simple_example.mp3\`, \`transformed_example.mp3\`) showcasing the capabilities of your project. These could be original audio clips before and after applying your audio diffusion models. 4. **Requirements**: The \`requirements.txt\` file should list all the dependencies needed to run your project. 5. **License and Readme**: - **LICENSE**: Choose an appropriate license for your code, such as MIT or Apache 2.0, and include the full license text here. - **README.md**: This is your project's homepage on GitHub. It should include: - **Project Overview**: An introduction to your project and the problems it aims to solve. - **Installation Instructions**: Steps to install the project and its dependencies, ideally with code blocks (\`pip install -r requirements.txt\`). - **Usage Guide**: Clear examples of how to use your project, including running the notebooks and scripts. - **Contributing**: Guidelines for how others can contribute to your project. - **Examples and Results**: Summaries of what's in the \`examples\` directory, perhaps with audio embeds or links. - **Citations**: References to papers, datasets, or codebases you used or were inspired by. # Step 3: Engage with the Community - **Commit Early and Often**: Start committing your initial structure and iteratively update your repository. Small, frequent updates are easier to manage and track. - **Issues and Pull Requests**: Monitor and respond actively. Use issues to track bugs or feature requests, and review pull requests from contributors. - **Discussions**: If GitHub Discussions is available for your repository, use it to engage with your project's users and contributors more interactively. # Step 4: Promote Your Project Once your repository is populated and documented, share it on social platforms, relevant communities, and perhaps write a blog post to walk through the project's goals, achievements, and potential uses. Feedback can significantly guide future development. # Conclusion Building a comprehensive GitHub repository around a complex theme like audio diffusion models not only showcases your expertise but also contributes to the community's knowledge.

The shadows are moving!” Gloopy: “They seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!” Scene 4: The Connection - As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them. - This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication. Glitter (excitedly): “Gloopy, they’re smart! Let’s see if we can understand them.” Scene 5: Learning and Teaching - Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses. - After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another. Gloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.” Glitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop. Gloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!” Glitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!” Scene 7: The Transformation - As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see. Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new. Each show brings something different to the lineup, so let’s keep an open mind. Who knows? We might just find a new favorite among these newcomers! Write a tweet in late July where WOQ is the 2nd most popular show, and state what 1 is 🌟 Incredible news, #ToonFans! 📊 “World of Quest” has risen to become the 2nd most popular show on Kids’ WB this July, trailing right behind the unstoppable “Code Lyoko” at #1! 🎮🗺️ Talk about an adventure-packed summer!

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped!

User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us.

User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

August 2024 From September, some new shows are headed to CW4Kids: First is Redakai: Conquer the Kairu, Vampire Hunters (Dub of Demon Slayer, censored for kids) and Chaotic: Reloaded (Sequel series to Chaotic) Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Upcoming Fall Lineup – New Show Speculation!” User1: ToonTrekker Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:30 AM Big news, cartoon crew! Starting in September, CW4Kids is adding some spicy shows to the mix, and I for one am stoked! “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu” sounds epic, and did anyone else hear about “Vampire Hunters”? It’s supposed to be a kid-friendly version of “Demon Slayer.” And then there’s “Chaotic: Reloaded,” a sequel to the original “Chaotic,” which I’m hoping will carry on the legacy. Anybody else got thoughts or hopes for these new additions? User2: DigitalDive Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:50 AM Whoa, a dub of “Demon Slayer” for kids? That’s ambitious! CW4Kids really isn’t afraid to push the boundaries, are they? Sounds like they’ll need to get creative with the censorship, but I’m intrigued. And “Redakai” should fit right in with the action-packed vibes of the channel. User3: MysticToonMage Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:15 AM “Chaotic: Reloaded” is where it’s at for me! I lost countless hours to the original series, and I’m thrilled to jump back into that world. As for “Vampire Hunters,” CW4Kids has always been good at adapting shows for their audience, so I’m keen to see how they handle it. User4: SaturdayAMSuperfan Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:45 AM Excited and curious to see how “Redakai” performs. It has big shoes to fill with the current lineup, but the premise sounds action-packed. As for “Vampire Hunters,” color me intrigued. It’s a bold move for CW4Kids, but if done right, it could be a hit! User5: RetroToonRewinder Posted on August 20, 2024, at 12:05 PM “Chaotic: Reloaded”? Count me in! The original was a blast. There’s something so thrilling about seeing a show get a second wind—especially with sequels on CW4Kids.

This conversion process depends on understanding what each term represents: - **Left**: The x-coordinate of the leftmost edge of the bounding box. - **Right**: The x-coordinate of the rightmost edge of the bounding box. - **Top**: The y-coordinate of the top edge of the bounding box. (In some coordinate systems, this might be the lower value if the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left.) - **Bottom**: The y-coordinate of the bottom edge of the bounding box. (In some coordinate systems, this might represent the higher value if the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left.) - **x**: The x-coordinate where you want your bounding box to start (typically this is the left edge). - **y**: The y-coordinate where you want your bounding box to start (typically this is the top edge, but remember the coordinate system orientation). - **w (width)**: The width of the bounding box. - **h (height)**: The height of the bounding box. # Conversion Given the definitions above, you can convert from left, right, top, bottom to x, y, w, h using the following formulas: \`\`\`plaintext x = left y = top w = right - left h = bottom - top \`\`\` These formulas assume a coordinate system where (0,0) is at the top-left corner, which is common in computer graphics and image processing. In this system, \`x\` and \`y\` coordinates increase as you move right and down, respectively. # Example If you have a bounding box with the following coordinates: - Left: 100 - Right: 300 - Top: 50 - Bottom: 200 Then, using the conversion formulas: - **x** = 100 - **y** = 50 - **w** = 300 - 100 = 200 - **h** = 200 - 50 = 150 So, your converted bounding box in x, y, w, h format would be (100, 50, 200, 150). If your coordinate system is such that (0,0) is at the bottom left (less common in pure image processing contexts but possible in other graphics or geospatial systems), adjust the formulas for \`y\` and \`h\` to reflect your system's orientation."},{"prompt":"then convert into xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax","completion":"To convert from the x, y, width (w), height (h) format back to xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax (which corresponds to left, right, top, bottom respectively in the initial question), you essentially have to reverse the process described before. Given that: - **x** is the x-coordinate of the starting point (typically the left edge), - **y** is the y-coordinate of the starting point (typically the top edge), - **w** is the width of the bounding box, - **h** is the height of the bounding box, The conversion would go as follows: # Conversion Formula - **xmin** (left) = x - **xmax** (right) = x + w - **ymin** (top) = y - **ymax** (bottom) = y + h # Example Revisited Let's take the converted bounding box we got earlier: - **x** = 100 - **y** = 50 - **w** = 200 - **h** = 150 Applying the formulas for the conversion back to xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax: - **xmin** = x = 100 - **xmax** = x + w = 100 + 200 = 300 - **ymin** = y = 50 - **ymax** = y + h = 50 + 150 = 200 So, the converted bounding box coordinates in xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax format would be xmin=100, xmax=300, ymin=50, ymax=200, which aligns with the original left, right, top, bottom values we started with. This demonstrates a full round trip of conversions between the two formats and ensures a clear understanding of the relationship between each representation of a bounding box."},{"prompt":"What is yolo format of annotation","completion":"The YOLO (You Only Look Once) format of annotation is specifically designed for the YOLO object detection algorithm. This annotation format is different from more traditional formats like Pascal VOC (which uses XML files) or COCO (JSON format). The YOLO format simplifies annotations into a straightforward, space-delimited text format that is easy to read and write programmatically. In the YOLO annotation format, each object within an image is described by one line in a text file. Each of these lines provides the object class and the bounding box coordinates. However, the coordinates are normalized to fall between 0 and 1, making the annotations independent of the image size. This normalization allows the model to be applied to images of different sizes more flexibly. Each line in a YOLO annotation file contains five values separated by spaces: \`\`\` <class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height> \`\`\` Here's what each of these values represents: 1. **class**: The class ID of the object, usually an integer starting from 0. 2. **x_center** and **y_center**: The x and y coordinates of the center of the bounding box. These values are normalized to fall between 0 and 1, with respect to the width and height of the image respectively. 3. **width** and **height**: The width and height of the bounding box. Just like the center coordinates, these values are normalized to fall between 0 and 1 relative to the image's width and height. # How To Normalize Bounding Box Coordinates Assuming you have the absolute coordinates of the bounding box in the format \`(x_min, y_min, width, height)\` and the dimensions of the image are \`(image_width, image_height)\`, you would calculate the YOLO format values as follows: \`\`\`python x_center_normalized = (x_min + width / 2) / image_width y_center_normalized = (y_min + height / 2) / image_height width_normalized = width / image_width height_normalized = height / image_height \`\`\` # Example Consider an image with dimensions \`1920x1080\` pixels, and there's an object of class \`1\` with a bounding box at \`(480, 300)\` of width \`960\` and height \`540\`. The normalized YOLO format annotation would look like this: \`\`\` 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 \`\`\` In this example, \`(0.5, 0.5)\` is the normalized center of the bounding box, and \`(0.5, 0.5)\` represents the normalized width and height of the bounding box, signifying that the object occupies half the width and half the height of the entire image. This YOLO format is particularly useful for the training process of YOLO object detection models, as it provides a compact and efficient way to represent object annotations."},{"prompt":"in c#, come posso scrivere la query verso mongo DB evitando il ciclo for? --- public IFetchedJob Dequeue(string[] queues, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { if (queues == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(queues)); } if (queues.Length == 0) { throw new ArgumentException(\\"Queue array must be non-empty.\\", nameof(queues)); } var filter = Builders<JobQueueDto>.Filter; var fetchConditions = new[] { filter.Eq(_ => _.FetchedAt, null), filter.Lt(_ => _.FetchedAt, DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(_storageOptions.InvisibilityTimeout.Negate().TotalSeconds)) }; var fetchConditionsIndex = 0; var options = new FindOneAndUpdateOptions<JobQueueDto> { IsUpsert = false, ReturnDocument = ReturnDocument.After }; JobQueueDto fetchedJob = null; while (fetchedJob == null) { cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); var fetchCondition = fetchConditions[fetchConditionsIndex]; foreach (var queue in queues) { fetchedJob = _connection .JobGraph .OfType<JobQueueDto>() .FindOneAndUpdate( fetchCondition & filter.Eq(_ => _.Queue, queue), Builders<JobQueueDto>.Update.Set(_ => _.FetchedAt, DateTime.UtcNow), options, cancellationToken); if (fetchedJob != null) { break; } } if (fetchedJob == null) { // No more jobs found in any of the requested queues... if (fetchConditionsIndex == fetchConditions.Length - 1) { // ...and we are out of fetch conditions as well. // Wait for a while before polling again. cancellationToken.WaitHandle.WaitOne(_storageOptions.QueuePollInterval); cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); } } // Move on to next fetch condition fetchConditionsIndex = (fetchConditionsIndex + 1) % fetchConditions.Length; } return new MongoFetchedJob(_connection, fetchedJob.Id, fetchedJob.JobId, fetchedJob.Queue); } ---","completion":"Per evitare l'uso del ciclo \`foreach\` nella tua query a MongoDB e al tempo stesso mantenere una logica che permetta di cercare su più code (\`queues\`), puoi modificare la query affinché usi l'operatore \`in\` di MongoDB.

I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day! (Note: Step 3 and Step 8 are repeating, but the (3,7) term in Step 8 is not the same as the (3,7) term in Step 3. ) Fifth Response <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at 20 the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer.

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same. Where do I make te mistake? Thanks for any help! ;) • Have you tried use cos^2theta+sin^2theta =1 – Fan May 15 '17 at 19:13 • You didn't err. You just didn't finish. May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","completion":"Given the complex task of summarizing and clarifying the extensive information provided, it's important to focus on the key points and innovations detailed across the segments, mainly surrounding the Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for transformers, the techniques employed including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and how these are applied for extracting LoRA adapters, comparisons with other models and approaches, and considerations on the compute efficiency and potential instability during training. # Simplified Summary Imagine you're giving a kid a box of Lego pieces (the base language model) to build a certain model. Now, this kid has learned over time that by combining some unique smaller sets (LoRA adapters) in different ways, they can quickly modify the big model to look like a spaceship, a car, or a house without having to rebuild it from scratch. These small sets are like smart shortcuts that add specific new features or abilities to the base model. Researchers now have a smart method to find these unique sets in a more efficient way. They use a special magnifying glass (Singular Value Decomposition or SVD) to look into the big Lego model and identify which smaller sets were added to make it behave in a certain new way (such as making it more knowledgeable about weather or sports). This way, instead of teaching the Lego model from scratch, they can quickly tweak it to be good at new tasks, saving time and effort. However, finding these sets and making sure they fit well without causing the model to become unstable or forget its previous cool tricks (like being good at general conversation) can be tricky. The researchers developed and tested methods to ensure these new sets integrate well without causing issues, even though it requires careful handling and sometimes might require more computing resources. In essence, they're making these intelligent Lego models more adaptable and quicker to learn new tricks by efficiently identifying and integrating these magical small sets, making them even smarter and more versatile, like having a Lego model that can easily transform between being a race car to a spaceship, depending on what you need. # Key Innovations & Takeaways - **LoRA and SVD**: This technique is about efficiently tuning large language models to perform new tasks without having to train them from scratch. - **Extraction and Integration**: The focus is on cleverly identifying and integrating adapters to fine-tune models efficiently for specific tasks. - **Compute Efficiency**: While effective, these techniques can be computation-intensive, highlighting a balance between enhancing model performance and managing compute resources. - **Stability in Learning**: Ensuring that introducing these adapters doesn’t destabilize the model or detract from its original capabilities is a crucial consideration. # Conclusion The work described explores advanced methods to make AI models more versatile and quicker to adapt, akin to giving them a 'shortcut' to learn new things. This not only makes AI more powerful but also more accessible, by reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, it requires careful balance and handling to ensure these 'shortcuts' integrate well without negative side effects, underlining the ongoing challenge in the field of AI to manage trade-offs between performance, stability, and resource efficiency."},{"prompt":"what is yolo format of annotation","completion":"The YOLO (You Only Look Once) format of annotation is designed for use with the YOLO object detection system, which is a popular framework for performing object detection tasks in real-time by looking at the image only once. This format is notably simple and efficient, catering to the YOLO algorithm's need for speed and accuracy. Annotations in YOLO format are typically used to train and evaluate the YOLO model, allowing it to recognize and localize objects within images. In YOLO format, annotations for each object in an image are usually stored in a separate text file with the same name as the image file but with a \`.txt\` extension. Each line in the file corresponds to one object and contains five values separated by spaces. These values are: 1. **Object class ID**: An integer that represents the class of the object (e.g., 0 for person, 1 for bicycle). The specific integers for each object class are defined based on the ordering of classes in a separate class names file. 2. **Center x coordinate**: The x coordinate of the center of the bounding box, normalized by the width of the image (i.e., the x coordinate divided by the image width). This value should be between 0 and 1. 3. **Center y coordinate**: The y coordinate of the center of the bounding box, normalized by the height of the image (i.e., the y coordinate divided by the image height). This value should also be between 0 and 1. 4. **Width of the bounding box**: The width of the bounding box, normalized by the width of the image. Like the other normalized values, this should be between 0 and 1. 5. **Height of the bounding box**: The height of the bounding box, normalized by the height of the image, and should also be between 0 and 1. Here is an example line from a YOLO annotation file, representing an object annotation: \`\`\` 0 0.50625 0.39444444444444443 0.2125 0.4222222222222222 \`\`\` In this example, the first value (\`0\`) indicates the object class ID. The next values (\`0.50625\` and \`0.39444444444444443\`) specify the normalized x and y coordinates of the bounding box center. The last two values (\`0.2125\` and \`0.4222222222222222\`) indicate the normalized width and height of the bounding box, respectively. This format is widely appreciated for its simplicity and efficiency, making it well-suited for training objects detection models like YOLO that require high-speed processing."},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical, Where does the M231 go, other than the Port of Newhaven ?","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario, envisioning where the M231 might go aside from the Port of Newhaven requires a bit of creative interpretation. The M231 refers to a specific item or place, and without specific context, it could refer to multiple things.

Let's assume the goal of the M231 is to enhance transportation efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and improve access from the Port of Newhaven to the broader motorway network in the UK. # Starting Point: Port of Newhaven, Sussex The Port of Newhaven is situated on the coast of Sussex, England, and serves as a vital point for ferry services and cargo. The starting point of the M231 would logically be close to this port to facilitate direct access for transport and haulage services. # Direction and Key Features The hypothetical M231 would likely head northwards from Newhaven to bypass Brighton to the east. The motorway would aim to connect with the existing motorway network with minimal disruption to the South Downs, an area of outstanding natural beauty and considerable ecological and cultural importance. # Possible Route 1. **Leaving Newhaven:** The motorway would start near the port, strategically placed to handle both passenger and freight traffic efficiently. 2. **Bypassing Brighton and Hove:** Instead of going through the urban areas of Brighton and Hove, the M231 could run to the east of these cities, potentially following a route somewhat parallel to the A27 but with a more direct trajectory to allow for faster travel. Care would be taken to mitigate environmental impact, possibly involving tunnel sections or viaducts to preserve the landscape and local ecosystems. 3. **Northward Towards the M23:** Continuing its route north, the M231 could aim to intersect with the A23 first, providing an indirect link to Brighton and other towns. The ultimate goal would be to join the M23 motorway, which serves as a main artery to London and connects with the wider UK motorway network. 4. **Interconnection with M23:** A logical point of merger could be planned north of the existing M23 terminus near Pease Pottage, avoiding major urban centers and instead focusing on creating a seamless transition from the M231 to the M23 for traffic bound for London or the M25 London Orbital Motorway, facilitating broader network access. # Implications - **Economic Growth:** Improved motorway access could significantly boost economic growth in Newhaven and surrounding areas by enhancing logistics and transport efficiency. - **Environmental Considerations:** The construction of a new motorway would necessitate careful environmental assessment, particularly to address concerns related to the South Downs. - **Infrastructure Development:** This project would likely spur additional infrastructure development, including service areas, junction improvements, and possibly new housing or commercial developments near interchanges.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Model download Define a utility function to download transformer models from the Hugging Face Hub, prefering .safetensors files over PyTorch .bin files. import os from huggingface_hub import list_repo_files, snapshot_download def download_transformers_model(repo_id, cache_dir=None): # Check for .safetensors files in the repository repo_files = list_repo_files(repo_id) has_safetensors = any(file.endswith(‘.safetensors’) for file in repo_files) # Define ignore_patterns based on the presence of .safetensors files ignore_patterns = [“.bin\\"] if has_safetensors else None # Download the repository, ignoring PyTorch .bin files if .safetensors files are present local_path = snapshot_download(repo_id=repo_id, cache_dir=cache_dir, ignore_patterns=ignore_patterns, ) print(f\\"Model downloaded to: {local_path}“) if has_safetensors: print(“Note: PyTorch .bin files were ignored due to the presence of .safetensors files.”) return os.path.abspath(local_path), has_safetensors # Downloading the base model cache_dir = ‘./models’ base_model_download_path, base_model_has_safetensors = download_transformers_model(base_model_id, cache_dir) models = { ‘base’ : { ‘download_path’ : base_model_download_path, ‘has_safetensors’ : base_model_has_safetensors }, ‘target’ : None } # Identifying relevant model layers Define functions to identify linear and embedding layers within transformer models.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day!

She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at 20 the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18).

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same. Where do I make te mistake? Thanks for any help! ;) • Have you tried use cos^2theta+sin^2theta =1 – Fan May 15 '17 at 19:13 • You didn't err. You just didn't finish. May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","completion":"To simplify this for you, the process described in this comprehensive code and explanation involves training a neural network, specifically a type of model called a transformer, to refine its capabilities to perform specific tasks or understandings without needing to train it from scratch. This is akin to teaching an existing expert (the pretrained transformer model) new tricks or refining its existing knowledge rather than training a new expert from the beginning. 1. **Choosing the Recipe Books:** The process begins by selecting a base model (like choosing a basic recipe book you know well) and a target model (a new recipe book with new recipes) from which we want to extract refined knowledge or 'recipes'. 2. **Preparation:** Before we start, we make sure all tools (software libraries like PyTorch, transformers, etc.) are ready. 3. **Downloading the Books:** Next, we download these models (recipe books) from a large repository (Hugging Face Hub). 4. **Identifying Special Ingredients:** We then identify which parts of the model (like specific ingredients in recipes) are crucial for our new specific tasks. In modeling terms, we look for embedding and linear layers which can be adjusted or tuned. 5. **Getting the New Ingredients:** Here, we download the specific new model (or new set of recipes) we wish to learn from. 6. **Reading the Ingredients:** This step involves loading the model parameters (or, in our analogy, understanding the ingredients and methods used in the recipes). 7. **Creating a New Recipe:** In the most intricate step, we mathematically combine knowledge from both sets of recipes to create a new, simplified yet effective set of recipes (model adaptation), using a mathematical technique called low-rank decomposition. 8. **Extracting the Essence:** The new, refined knowledge or set of 'recipes' is then saved in a simplified format so it can be more efficiently used. 9. **Testing the Dish:** To ensure the new recipes work as expected, we test them by generating responses from the model, akin to tasting a dish to ensure it has the desired flavor. 10. **Sharing Your Recipe:** Finally, satisfied with the new recipe, we share it with others by uploading it to the repository (Hugging Face Hub) for others to use. This entire process is a sophisticated way of teaching an existing neural network model new skills or refining its existing skills without needing to retrain it entirely, similar to teaching new, advanced cooking techniques to an already skilled chef."},{"prompt":"can you write code for paper S-type speed control curve based on the number of pluses","completion":"Certainly! S-curve speed control is commonly used in motion control applications, including robotics and CNC machines, to start and stop the motion smoothly. This approach helps in reducing the mechanical stress on parts and ensures a smoother transition across the velocity profile. To implement an S-type speed control curve based on the number of pulses (assuming the pulses correlate directly to position or speed increments), we can use a piecewise function that divides the motion into different phases: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration. Here's a basic implementation using Python. This program will simulate an S-curve motion profile by generating the position (in pulses) over time. The S-curve in this context is generated by modulating acceleration during the acceleration and deceleration phases to have a smoother ramp-up and ramp-down. We're using a simple approach to approximate the S-curve by using a sinusoidal function to adjust the acceleration smoothly. Note: This is a simplified example. In real applications, the control parameters and algorithms can be much more complex and require tuning based on the hardware and motion requirements. \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def generate_s_curve(total_pulses, total_time, acc_phase_fraction=0.3): \\"\\"\\" Generates an S-curve profile based on total pulses and time.

Notably, they maintained a semi-nomadic lifestyle and a feudal system of government, contrasting with the more centralized bureaucracy of the Achaemenids and the Sassanids. Their military tactics, especially their use of heavily armored cavalry and horse archers, set them apart and allowed for remarkable flexibility and effectiveness in battle. Culturally, the Parthians were more inclined towards a syncretic approach, blending Greek, Persian, and local traditions, which is reflected in their art and architecture. This multifaceted identity helped them control a vast and diverse empire but also differentiated their administrative and cultural practices significantly from those of their neighbors and successors."},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What happened in Persia between the fall of the Achaemenids and the rise of the Parthians?","completion":"Between the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC and the rise of the Parthian Empire in 247 BC, Persia underwent significant transition. After Alexander the Great conquered the Achaemenids, his empire fragmented upon his death in 323 BC, leading to the Hellenistic period dominated by the Diadochi (his generals and successors). This era saw the establishment of the Seleucid Empire, which controlled Persia until the Parthians, under the leadership of Arsaces I, gradually began to assert their independence, taking advantage of the Seleucids' weakening grip due to internal strife and external pressures. This period was marked by a fusion of Greek and Persian cultures but also by growing unrest and power struggles, setting the stage for the rise of the Parthian Empire."},{"prompt":"НАЙДИ 7 штук ФРАЗЕОЛОГИЧЕСКИХ КАЛАМБУРОВ ИЗ книги “The Phantom Tollbooth”","completion":"Книга \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" («Привиденский платный проезд») Нортона Джастера изобилует играми слов, фразеологизмами и каламбурами, благодаря чему текст получается не только увлекательным, но и многогранным.

Персонаж приветствует главного героя в Земле Знаний, намекая на непостоянство погоды и выборов, стоящих перед человеком. 2. **Which Witch** – Используется игра звучания между словами \\"which\\" (которая) и \\"witch\\" (ведьма), отсылая нас к персонажу, который может запутать путешественников своими словами, как ведьма могла бы запутывать заклинаниями. 3. **The Doldrums** – Хотя это и не прямой фонетический каламбур, название \\"The Doldrums\\" и звучание слова создаёт впечатление пустоты и стагнации, что отражает состояние \\"безветрия\\" в этом месте, где жители не делают ничего. 4. **Half Bakery** – Игра слов между \\"half-baked\\" (недопечённый, сырой, непродуманный) и буквальным значением \\"пекарня, где делают половинки вещей\\". Это намек на место, где создаются идеи, которые не до конца проработаны. 5. **The Silent Valley** – В оригинале игра слов отсутствует, но сама концепция тишины в долине, где раньше были звуки, создаёт контраст между ожидаемым использованием долины (как места полного жизни и звуков) и фактическим состоянием тишины. 6. **Canby** – Это слово является каламбуром, ведь его можно интерпретировать как \\"Can Be\\" (Может Быть), что подчёркивает потенциал или возможности в контексте, где это слово используется.

I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

Imagine you have a very complicated recipe book (a machine learning model) that helps you cook exactly what you want (generate text, recognize images, etc.). However, this book is huge, and you only want to cook something very specific. Copying the entire book would be too much work and not necessary. Instead, you find a clever way to copy only the necessary parts to tweak your existing recipes slightly and achieve the new dish you’re aiming for. This method of copying only what’s needed and integrating it with your current recipes is known as Low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Here’s how the code you shared works, using this analogy: 1. Choosing the Recipe Books: It starts by selecting two recipe books - a base book (‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’), which you already know, and a target book (‘valine/OpenSnark’), which has the new recipe you want. 2. Preparation: Before you start, you ensure you have all the tools and ingredients ready ( pip install … is like making sure you have all the kitchen tools and ingredients). 3. Downloading the Books: The code then downloads these recipe books from a huge library (Hugging Face Hub). 4. Identifying Special Ingredients: It looks through the books to find the special ingredients and methods (‘linear and embedding layers’) that make the new recipe unique. 5. Getting the New Ingredients: The code downloads the target book with the new recipe. 6. Reading the Ingredients: It reads through the books to understand the ingredients and methods used (‘loading tensors’). 7. Creating a New Recipe: The most magical part comes next - the code combines ingredients from both books to create a new, simplified recipe. This process is called low-rank decomposition, which is a fancy way of saying it finds a simpler way to combine the complex methods. 8. Extracting the Essence: The new recipe is then saved (‘Extract the LoRAs’) in a simple format so you can use it without the entire book. 9. Testing the Dish: To make sure the new recipe works, the code tries it out by cooking something (‘Testing the result’). 10. Sharing Your Recipe: Happy with the new dish? The code then helps you share this recipe with others by uploading it to the library (‘Hugging Face Hub’) so others can try it too. So, essentially, this code cleverly extracts a specific “taste” or “style” from one big recipe book (model) and makes it easy to apply to your dishes without needing to copy the entire book! CONTINUE CONVERSATION: What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc Yijia Shao Stanford University Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc Nick Haber Stanford University Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, Jane's ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers' market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day! (Note: Step 3 and Step 8 are repeating, but the (3,7) term in Step 8 is not the same as the (3,7) term in Step 3. ) Fifth Response <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at 20 the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. What do we know? - Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18). E.3 Quiet-STaR-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day. This is the total number of eggs. 3 of the eggs are eaten for breakfast. This is the number of eggs that are eaten for breakfast. 4 of the eggs are used to make muffins. This is the number of eggs that are used to make muffins. 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 9 is the number of eggs that are sold at the farmers' market. 9 of the eggs are sold at the farmers' market. 2 The price of each egg is 2. 2 times 9 = 18 18 is the total price of the eggs. The total price of the eggs is 18. Second Response: 21 A: Let's think step by step. 1. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. She eats 3 for breakfast every morning. 3.

The amount in dollars that she makes every day at the farmers' market is 18. A: 18</s> Fourth Response: A: Let's think step by step. The number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 16. Of these, she eats 3 for breakfast every morning. This is 3. Of these, she bakes muffins for her friends with 4. This is 4. 22 The number of eggs that are left over is 16 - 3 - 4. This is 16 - 7. This is 9. The number of eggs that she sells at the farmers' market daily for 2 per egg is 9. The total in dollars that she makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 2. This is 9 2. This is 18. The total in dollars that she makes every day at the farmers' market is 18. A: 18 Fifth Response A: Let's think step by step. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day. This is the total number of eggs. 3 + 4 + 16 = 23 3 eggs are eaten for breakfast every morning. 4 eggs are used to make muffins for her friends every day. 16 eggs are sold at the farmers' market for 2 each every day. The 16 eggs that are sold at the farmers' market are the remaining eggs. 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 9 eggs are sold at the farmers' market for 2 each every day. 9 (2) = 18 18 is the total in dollars that she makes every day at the farmers' market. 18 is the answer. A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same. Where do I make te mistake? Thanks for any help! ;) • Have you tried use cos^2theta+sin^2theta =1 – Fan May 15 '17 at 19:13 • You didn't err. You just didn't finish. May 15 '17 at 19:35 hint In your last line, factor by sin (theta), replace sin^2(theta) by 1-cos^2 (theta) Figure 8: Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","completion":"This document discusses an intricate technique known as Quiet-STaR for incorporating reasoning into the functioning of language models. It's about teaching these digital brains to \\"think\\" in a way that's beneficial for predicting or generating text, thereby boosting their performance on tasks that require understanding or reasoning. Imagine if your cookbook could not only give you recipes but also suggest modifications based on what's in your fridge or offer alternatives when you're missing an ingredient. That's akin to what's happening here, but instead of cooking, the focus is on processing language and generating text that aligns with a specific goal, like answering a question correctly. The core of this technique lies in a process where the language model generates internal \\"thoughts\\" or rationales while processing text. These are not separate entities but part of the model's ongoing task, akin to a chef considering different spices while tasting a dish to understand what might enhance the flavor. These internal deliberations help the model to refine its output, improving accuracy or relevance. The document illustrates this process through various experiments, showcasing how this method, dubbed Quiet-STaR, leads to models that not only perform better on specific tasks like math problems or commonsense questions but also generate more coherent and structured chains of thought. It's like teaching the model to ponder its answers more deeply, using a blend of its learned knowledge and a structured approach to reasoning. However, the document also points out challenges, such as the difficulty in balancing exploration (generating varied thoughts) and exploitation (using these thoughts effectively). Addressing these challenges is crucial for stabilizing the learning process and ensuring the model can consistently benefit from its internal reasoning. In summary, the document is about equipping language models with the ability to \\"think\\" about the text they process, improving their problem-solving capabilities. It's a step toward making these models not just tools for generating text based on what they've seen before, but entities capable of applying reasoning to generate more accurate, relevant, and nuanced outputs."},{"prompt":"mbnmnbmn","completion":"Hello!

It's a cornerstone of Gothic literature and considered by many as the first true science fiction story. The novel is composed as a series of letters written by Captain Robert Walton, who recounts the tragic story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a grotesque but sentient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Here are some key points and themes of the novel: # Major Themes - **The pursuit of knowledge**: Victor's quest for the secret of life represents the human drive to understand and control the world. - **Isolation**: Both Victor and the monster experience profound loneliness, leading to tragic outcomes. - **Nature versus nurture**: The novel explores how society and environment contribute to the monster's development and actions. - **Monstrosity**: Shelley challenges the idea of what makes a monster, suggesting that actions and society's rejection are more monstrous than one's physical appearance. - **Responsibility**: Victor's failure to accept responsibility for his creation and its actions is a central theme. # Plot Overview 1. **Robert Walton's letters**: The story begins with Captain Walton writing letters to his sister, wherein he recounts his encounter with Victor Frankenstein in the Arctic. 2. **Victor's story**: Victor tells Walton about his childhood, his obsession with discovering the secret of life, and his eventual success in bringing a creature to life. However, horrified by what he has created, Victor abandons the creature. 3. **The creature's journey**: The creature experiences initial kindness from the natural world but is soon met with fear and hostility from humans. He learns to speak and read by observing a family and eventually confronts Victor, demanding a companion. 4. **The promise and its breaking**: Victor agrees but ultimately destroys the female creature he begins to create. In response, the creature vows revenge, leading to the deaths of Victor's loved ones, including his bride, Elizabeth. 5. **Conclusion**: Victor devotes the remainder of his life to seeking revenge on the creature. Ultimately, Victor dies on Walton's ship, and the creature vanishes into the Arctic, suggesting he will end his own life. # Characters - **Victor Frankenstein**: The ambitious scientist who creates the creature. His obsession with creating life and his subsequent rejection of his creation drive the plot. - **The Creature**: Often called \\"Frankenstein's monster,\\" he is intelligent and articulate but rejected by society because of his appearance. - **Robert Walton**: The captain who rescues Victor in the Arctic, serving as a framing device for the narrative. - **Elizabeth Lavenza**: Victor’s cousin and love interest, whose tragic fate is central to the novel's climax. - **Henry Clerval**: Victor’s best friend, representing the human warmth and compassion absent in Victor's life. # Frankenstein's Legacy *Frankenstein* has had a profound impact on literature and popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations and reinterpretations. Its themes of the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition, the ethical limits of experimentation, the responsibilities of creators, and the societal rejection of those who are different remain relevant today.

In Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, after the creature comes to life, he indeed finds and wears old clothes to stay warm (B), eats berries he picked and drinks from a brook (C), figures out how to make and use fire (D), and finds shelter. However, there is no mention of him using a horse for transportation.

They were frightened by his monstrous appearance, which led them to scream, flee, and attack him. This reaction profoundly impacted the creature, teaching him about the harsh realities of human judgment and the cruelty he would face from society. This experience of rejection and violence from the villagers marked the beginning of his realization that he was fundamentally different and would not be accepted by human society. It's a pivotal moment that contributes significantly to his feelings of loneliness, isolation, and eventual bitterness towards humans, including his creator, Victor Frankenstein."},{"prompt":"What is not one of the the human activities that the creature learns about from the family in the cottage?

The novel goes into detail about how he learns of household chores (A), playing music (B, as he is particularly moved by the music played by the family), family dinners (duplicate \\"C\\"), and expressing emotions (E). Therefore, the correct choice based on the activities not directly mentioned or focused on would be: C. Celebrating holidays. It’s worth noting that while the creature learns a great deal about human emotions, social interactions, and even education from the De Lacey family, detailed descriptions of holiday celebrations are not among the specific activities highlighted in Mary Shelley's narrative during this segment of the novel."},{"prompt":"what is one way the creature showed a sense of morality?","completion":"The creature in Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* demonstrates a sense of morality through several actions, one poignant example being his assistance to the De Lacey family. Despite receiving nothing in return and even risking discovery and attack, the creature secretly helps the family by gathering firewood for them at night, ensuring they have enough to keep warm and cook. He does this after observing their poverty and struggles, showing empathy and a desire to aid them despite his own hardships. This act of kindness, done anonymously and without any expectation of reward, shows that the creature possesses an innate sense of goodness and understands the concept of moral actions. It also highlights the creature’s capacity for compassion, directly contrasting with the horror and fear his appearance inspires in those who see him. This discrepancy between his outward appearance and inner goodness is a central theme in Shelley's novel, exploring ideas about the nature of humanity and the superficiality of societal judgments."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical court case, United States v. United States where the gov sued itself for failing to pay debt","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where \\"United States v. United States\\" describes a court case involving the government suing itself for failing to pay debt, we would be navigating uncharted legal territory with significant constitutional implications. Although this situation is highly unlikely, contemplating it can offer insights into the separation of powers, federalism, and the principle of sovereign immunity. # Separation of Powers and Federalism The United States federal government is divided into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Each has distinct powers and responsibilities, with checks and balances in place to prevent abuses. The scenario where one branch sues another or the federal entity sues itself raises questions about the separation of powers. It's hard to imagine a scenario within the current constitutional framework where such a case would be considered, as it would imply a significant conflict within the federal government's operations. In terms of federalism, the United States is also a union of states, each with its government. The federal government suing itself over debt could potentially involve conflicts between state and federal law or finances, but again, the constitution provides ways to resolve such disputes without needing to resort to the federal government suing itself. # Sovereign Immunity Sovereign immunity is a principle that prevents the government or its subdivisions (states, agencies) from being sued without their consent. For the federal government to sue itself, it would have to waive its sovereign immunity, a complex and unlikely scenario. Federal law, including the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), outlines specific conditions under which the government can be sued, and these do not include a provision for the government to take legal action against itself. # Practical Considerations and Precedents There are no real precedents for a \\"United States v. United States\\" lawsuit involving debt payment. The closest scenarios might involve disputes between federal agencies or between states and the federal government, but these are handled through existing legal and administrative frameworks designed to address such conflicts without resorting to the courts in a manner suggesting the government is taking legal action against itself. # Theoretical Resolution In this purely hypothetical scenario, such a case would likely be resolved through political and administrative mechanisms rather than judicial ones. Congress, responsible for federal budgeting and debt management, would need to address the underlying issues leading to the failure to pay debt. Alternatively, executive agencies involved in managing finances might seek resolution through internal government processes. # Conclusion While it's an interesting thought experiment to consider the United States government suing itself over failing to pay debt, the real-world legal and constitutional frameworks make such a situation highly improbable. Existing mechanisms for resolving intergovernmental disputes and managing government debt are designed to prevent precisely this kind of legal paradox."},{"prompt":"Scenario.","completion":"Given the interest in contemplating how a scenario involving the United States government suing itself might unfold, let's delve into a hypothetical scenario that could theoretically give rise to such an unprecedented situation, along with its potential resolution pathways. # Background Imagine a situation where a significant administrative error or a severe lapse in governance leads to a specific branch of the U.S. federal government (for instance, an executive agency) failing to make mandatory payments to another branch or agency. This error might stem from conflicting interpretations of a new financial regulation that was poorly drafted and ambiguously implemented. # Scenario Unfolding Initial Conflict The refusal or failure to make these payments has a cascading effect on the operations of the affected agency, which then seeks recourse through legal means to compel the payment that it is owed according to federal law. The agency, after failing to achieve a resolution through administrative channels, decides to take unprecedented action to resolve the impasse. Legal Peculiarities Given the principle of sovereign immunity, a legal challenge directly targeting the government would generally be impossible without the government's consent. However, in this scenario, Congress quickly passes a specific piece of legislation allowing this unique case to proceed to the Federal Courts as a special exception, motivated by the widespread public and political pressure to resolve the financial deadlock that's disrupting government operations. Court Case: United States v. United States The case, officially filed as \\"United States (Plaintiff Agency) v. United States (Defendant Agency),\\" moves rapidly through the court system due to its high-profile nature and the urgent need for a resolution. The Supreme Court agrees to hear the case given its constitutional implications, particularly regarding the interpretation of the financial regulation and the separation of powers. # Resolution In this hypothetical scenario, the Supreme Court might take several approaches: 1. **Interpretive Resolution**: The Court could issue a ruling that clarifies the ambiguous regulation, instructing how payments should be managed and rectifying the administrative error without formally addressing the notion of the government suing itself. 2. **Constitutional Guidance**: The Supreme Court could use this unique case as an opportunity to offer broader guidance on the separation of powers, potentially setting new precedents on how inter-agency disputes are managed, especially concerning financial obligations. 3. **Administrative Remedy**: Rather than a direct ruling on the dispute, the Court might order the creation of a new administrative process or body specifically designed to handle these types of inter-agency financial disagreements, essentially directing a governmental internal resolution. # Conclusion While this scenario stretches the boundaries of current legal frameworks and constitutional considerations, it serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities involved in government operations and the importance of clear legal and administrative procedures. Ultimately, the resolution of such a hypothetical conflict would likely emphasize the need for effective governance, clear legislation, and the capacity for the government to adapt and resolve internal conflicts without resorting to litigation, even in the most unusual circumstances."},{"prompt":"The part drawing should be sketched based on the tool path.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Sren Kierkegaard 1 Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? 1 arXiv:2403.09629v2 [cs.CL] 18 Mar 2024 START + Sampled Thought 4 + 1 END LM LM LM 1 Discard 2 + 1 2 START + 1) Think = 5 4 n 2 2 END Thought1 Thought3 Thought4 Thought5 Thought7 + LM LM LM LM LM Reward Harms Prediction Helps Prediction LM Thought2 LM LM LM LM LM 4 Thought0 LM 2) Talk 3) Learn Original Text Sampled Thought Thought6 Figure 1: Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot directreasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3%→47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9%→10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2: Generalization Results.

The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 6. 2 Related Work 2.1 Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. 2.2 Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the 3 Algorithm 1: Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) Input: Language model θ0, training steps num steps, sequence length l, thought length t, learning rate α, batch size b, number of thoughts nthoughts, number of ground truth tokens used for supervising each thought ntrue Output: Language model θ that generates rationales to predict future text for i = 0 to num steps do Sample batch of sequences X of length l h init ← hidden statesθi (X) for j = 1 to l in parallel using attention mask do log p init j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h init j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens Tj ← generate tokensθi ([X:j ; <start thought>], t, nthoughts) // Generate thought Tj ← [Tj ; <end thought>] h thought j:j+ntrue ← hidden statesθi ([X:j ; Tj ; Xj:j+ntrue−1 ]) log p thought j:j+ntrue ← lm headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue ) // Predict next tokens w/ thought wj:j+ntrue ← mixing headθi (h thought j:j+ntrue , h init j:j+ntrue ) log p talk j ← wj:j+ntrue · log p init j:j+ntrue + (1 − wj:j+ntrue ) · log p thought j:j+ntrue // Mix logits L NLL j ← − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) ∇θL REINFORCE j ← −rj1[rj > 0] · ∇θ log pθi (Tj |[X:j ; <start thought>]) ∇θLj ← ∇θL NLL j + ∇θL REINFORCE j θi+1 ← θi − α ∑ l j=1 ∇θLj // Update model parameters return θnum steps Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently VSTaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3 Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a 4 token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3 Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters θ with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that θ ∗ = arg maxθ Ex [logpθ (xi:n|x0:i , rationaleθ (x0:i))] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4 Quiet-STaR 4.1 Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across n tokens xi in an input sequence x0:n, we generate r rationales of length t: ci = (ci1 , . . . , cit), resulting in n × r rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. 4.2 Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “< bos > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token 5 a’ b’ c’ d’ a’’ b’’ c’’ d’’ Base a b c d Text Thought Token 1 Thought Token 2 a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ a b c d a’ b’ c’ d’ Base Text Thought Token 1 Generation Paths Parallel Inference Mask Figure 3: Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3 “Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the postthought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4 Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1 Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”−−−”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. 4.4.2 Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to 6 d e f g h <t> Thought </t> g h Figure 4: Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3 Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the ntrue true next tokens Xj+1:j+ntrue+1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale (p talk j:j+ntrue as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward rj for each rationale Tj as the difference between p talk j:j+ntrue and the average across rationales for that token (p talk j:j+ntrue ): rj = log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) − log p talk j:j+ntrue (Xj+1:j+ntrue+1) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters θ to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇θL REINFORCE j = −rj · ∇θ log pθ (Tj |[X:j ; <|startofthought|>]) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, though it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, L NLL j , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1 . 1Due to our linear mixing, equivalent to shifting the mixing weight toward the base prediction. 7 5 Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2 , as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. 5.1 Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K (5.9% → 8.1%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 42.6%) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning 2For example, in this very text, the token following “run” is “-” 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Samples for Majority Vote 30 40 50 GSM8K Accuracy (%) Accuracy on GSM8K vs Number of Majority Vote Samples Quiet-STaR + CoT Baseline (CoT) Figure 5: Zero-shot performance on Quiet-STaR applied to chain-of-thought on GSM8K. We visualize how using a Quiet-STaR trained Mistral model can improve chain-of-thought performance. We use an 8-thought-token-trained model and use its internal thoughts to improve the tokens in a zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. 5.2 Improvement Distribution As visualized in Appendix Figure 7, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Appendix Figure 8, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 5.3 Quiet-STaR and Chain-of-Thought While there are natural parallels between chain-of-thought prompting and our approach, they are orthogonal and complementary. In zero-shot chain-of-thought, a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution (Kojima et al., 2022); Quiet-STaR instead allows a model to think quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. We investigate using silent, Quiet-STaR, rationales while generating explicit CoT reasoning. Because our goal is generalist reasoning that requires no task-specific input at all, we used a zero-shot prompt (“Let’s think step by step.”) without in-context examples. Our experiments indicate that internal rationales allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, shown in Appendix E and visualized in Figure 5. The majority vote accuracy over 8 samples (cot-maj@8) increases from 40.6% to 47.7% with Quiet-STaR, as evaluated on a sample of 128 GSM8K test items. Note that each chain-of-thought solution is sampled with temperature 0.7. 5.4 Examples While there is no explicit regularization in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be humaninterpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. We discuss why this design choice benefits the training stability in Appendix I. For reference, we include examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. 9 '<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride.

However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix C for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 7 Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. 10 Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Large language models can learn rules. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07064, 2023. 15 Appendix A Hyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1e − 6, a weight decay of 0.001, and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1e2 and our policy weight is 1e6. We sample with temperature T = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature T = 3. Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between A · · · E, we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to A · · · E. Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. B Faster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes (b, t, l, d) and (b, 1, l, d) where t is the number of timesteps ahead, b is batch size, l is sequence length, and d is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape (b, t, l, l), we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape (b, t, l). Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. C Compute-Adjusted Plots We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. D Measuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 6% 7% 8% 9% 10% 11% GSM8K Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (a) GSM8K 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Training Step 34% 36% 38% 40% 42% 44% 46% CommonsenseQA Accuracy (%) # Thought, Ahead Tokens 24, 12 16, 8 12, 4 10, 4 8, 4 Baseline (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 6: Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. E Rationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature t = 1. E.1 Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let's think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18 ). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 17 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers' market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers' market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Let's write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let's see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer's market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer's market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. For the first step, let's think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet's ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. 18 Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet's ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers' market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2 OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that's 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? A: Let's think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we're given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is J a n e t s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. 19 M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you've done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let's say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 noneaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers' market.

A: 18 F Additional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates 23 that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a codeimprover using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes incontext (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning. G Distribution of Improvements We also visualize the distribution of improvements across tokens in the training set. Original Token Prediction Loss Improvement in Loss Given Thought Figure 7: Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 24 H Contribution Visualization 0icos^2θsin^3θ+5cosθsin^4θ+isin^5θ Then I used the Moivre's theorem and I got: (cos5θ+isin5θ) I compared the imaginary parts and I got something like: sin5θ=5cos^4θsinθ-10cos^2θsin^3θ+sin^5θ which is very close to: (16cos^4θ-12cos^2θ+1)sinθ but not the same.

We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. I Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these tradeoffs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token 25 predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 26\\"\\"","completion":"This paper introduces Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR), a novel framework that generalizes the concept of Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) by enabling language models (LMs) to autonomously generate intermediate rationales (“thoughts”) to aid their predictions on arbitrary text, rather than relying on specially curated datasets for reasoning tasks. While previous works on teaching LMs to reason have focused on specific tasks or predefined sets of tasks, Quiet-STaR leverages the idea that reasoning is implicit in almost all written text and thus can be learned through the task of language modeling itself. Key aspects of Quiet-STaR include: 1. **Parallel Rationale Generation**: Quiet-STaR generates thoughts across all tokens in input sequences in parallel, using a special tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm. This allows the model to consider internal thoughts for each token about its successors, improving prediction quality. 2. **Tokenwise Mixing and Learning Mechanism**: The LM uses custom meta-tokens to indicate the start and end of internal thoughts. After generating a thought, the model mixes the future-text predictions with and without the thought using a learned weighting mechanism, optimizing for better next-token predictions. 3. **REINFORCE-based Learning**: The model employs a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the generated thoughts, increasing the likelihood of thoughts that improve prediction accuracy. This is done without negatively impacting the model's base language modeling performance. 4. **Computational Efficiency**: The authors propose methods to scale Quiet-STaR training procedurally by efficiently generating rationales in a parallel manner and optimizing rationale-related embeddings. The paper demonstrates that Quiet-STaR, when applied to a base model like Mistral 7B using text corpora like OpenWebMath and C4, significantly improves zero-shot reasoning abilities on datasets such as CommonsenseQA and GSM8K. Notably, these improvements do not require fine-tuning on the specific tasks, highlighting the generalized reasoning capability Quiet-STaR imparts to LMs. In summary, Quiet-STaR represents a significant step toward more general and scalable reasoning in language models. The techniques presented here enable LMs to \\"think before they speak,\\" autonomously generating and leveraging internal rationales to improve their predictive capabilities across diverse text inputs."},{"prompt":"Que ce qui fait qu'on que ton âme reposé en paix","completion":"Il y a plusieurs éléments qui peuvent contribuer à ce que mon âme repose en paix.

While traditional shawarma is roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit, a home kitchen version can be just as delightful. Follow this recipe for a savory and aromatic beef shawarma without the need for special equipment. # Ingredients: For the Marinade: - 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil - 1/4 cup vinegar (apple cider vinegar works well) - Juice of 1 lemon - 3 garlic cloves, minced - 1 teaspoon ground cumin - 1 teaspoon paprika - 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste) - 1 teaspoon ground black pepper - 1 teaspoon salt - 2 tablespoons plain yogurt (optional, for tenderness) For the Beef Shawarma: - 2 pounds beef (a tender cut like sirloin, thinly sliced against the grain) - 1 large onion, thinly sliced - 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped For Serving: - Pita bread or flatbread - Tahini sauce or Garlic sauce - Sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions - Pickles or pickled vegetables - Fresh parsley, chopped # Instructions: 1. **Marinate the Beef:** - In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the marinade until well combined. - Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade. Ensure each slice is well-coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the meat to tenderize. 2. **Cook the Beef:** - Remove the beef from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. - Preheat a large skillet, griddle, or grill pan over medium-high heat. You want the pan really hot to get a good sear on the meat. - If needed, cook in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Add the marinated beef slices (without any excess marinade) and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until nicely seared and cooked to your preference. - In the last couple of minutes of cooking, add the thinly sliced onion to the pan, allowing it to soften and pick up the flavors. 3. **Assemble the Shawarma:** - Slice the cooked beef into smaller pieces if desired. - Warm the pita or flatbread, then layer with slices of beef, cooked onions, fresh parsley, and your choice of vegetables and sauces. - Roll up the bread around the fillings, or serve open-faced, allowing everyone to make their own. 4. **Serve Immediately:** - Serve your beef shawarma with additional tahini or garlic sauce on the side, along with any remaining fresh vegetables, pickles, and condiments. # Tips: - Marinating the beef for a longer period plays a critical role in developing the flavors and tenderizing the meat. - Cooking in a very hot pan ensures that the meat is seared quickly, retaining its juices and getting the characteristic edges found in traditional shawarma. - Customizing the accompaniments allows everyone to tailor their shawarma to their tastes, making the meal even more enjoyable. Enjoy your homemade beef shawarma, a dish that’s filled with flavor and perfect for gatherings or a special family meal."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

We'll need to break down and re-assess your process and conclusion. From the given solution, the system seems to be a linear system whose general solution can be expressed as combinations of the given solution(s), particularly if another independent solution can be found or if a particular solution's coefficients can be adjusted to meet the initial condition. Given solution: (x_1 = e^t begin{pmatrix} cos(4t) - 3sin(4t) 2cos(4t) + 2sin(4t) end{pmatrix}) If (x_1) is a particular solution to the differential equation (x' = Ax), and (A) is the matrix of coefficients, finding the general solution typically involves having a set of linearly independent solutions if necessary, and combining them, possibly along with finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors if we're incorporating a method involving them. However, given just one solution and an initial condition, let’s try to deduce the intended method for such a unique solution. **Given Initial Condition:** (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 7 -2 end{pmatrix}) You’re asked to find (x(t)) such that (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 7 -2 end{pmatrix}). Your method appears to aim at scaling the given solution, but the correct approach to meeting the initial condition involves using the principle of superposition if you have a complete set of independent solutions or adjusting coefficients directly. For this problem, assuming there is only one given solution (without the general method of solving for (x)), one would typically use the initial condition to find constants in a general solution formula that is expressed as a linear combination of known solutions and their derivatives (if need be, depending on the availability of those solutions). The solution you provided: (x = e^t begin{pmatrix} 7cos(4t) - sin(4t) -2cos(4t) + 6sin(4t) end{pmatrix}) doesn’t directly follow a clear method based on the given setup. **Clarification and Correction:** Without an additional independent solution or further context on (A) or method to generate the general solution, directly adjusting the coefficients in the given solution (x_1) to meet the initial condition (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 7 -2 end{pmatrix}) is speculative. If (x_1) is indeed meant to suggest the form of the general solution (due to its e^t component indicating a relation to an eigenvalue of 1 and a possible eigenvector or general form derived therefrom), a correct method would be more sophisticated, involving the decomposition of the solution, or checking if there's missing information such as a second linearly independent solution derived from another eigenvalue/eigenvector of (A). Given the information, there's a misunderstanding or misapplication in deriving the solution you provided. For a precise solution, additional context or steps based on a complete set of linearly independent solutions to form a general solution would be required, along with a more explicit utilization of the initial condition within such a framework."},{"prompt":"как удалить папку полностью в debian если не удаляется из-за полноты корзины","completion":"Если папка не удаляется из-за полноты корзины, вы можете попробовать удалить папку с помощью команды rm в терминале.

Подходы к составлению могут включать трансформацию фразеологических оборотов в буквальный контекст с учетом прямых значений составных частей, подмену элементов внутри стойких конструкций или тонкий намек на эти выражения через их контекстуально-описательное представление. Одним из примеров этого вида каламбура является персонаж по имени Short Shrift, который игнорирует главного героя, воплощая в себе значение фразе “to give short shrift to smb” (игнорировать кого-либо). Далее автор добавляет слой сложности к этому каламбуру, связывая его также с архаичным смыслом слова “shrift” (период между вынесением приговора и его исполнением), демонстрируя это на действиях персонажа, который сразу же исполняет вынесенный приговор, предоставляя “короткий срок”. Хотя может возникнуть вопрос, насколько молодая аудитория способна подметить и оценить тонкости таких языковых игр, эти каламбуры могут служить для образовательной цели, рассчитывая на то, что взрослые помогут детям раскрыть и оценить глубину и юмор, заложенный в этих словесных играх. Мило узнает об «Island of Conclusions», куда можно добраться «jumping to conclusions» (делая поспешные выводы), что представляет собой игру слов, где буквальный скачок соотносится с фразеологическим значением «делать выводы без достаточных оснований».

В данном контексте море (ocean) символизирует бескрайнее пространство молчания. 2. **Running Out of Time Hill** - холм, взбираться на который героям кажется бесконечно долгим. Это отсылка к фразеологизму «время уходит» или «время убегает» (time is running out), где буквальный процесс бега времени олицетворяется в физическом преодолении пространства вверх по холму. 3. **Catching Z's Forest** - лес, в котором герои не могут сопротивляться желанию вздремнуть, что является отсылкой к выражению «catch some Z's» (поймать пару часов сна). Здесь буквальный смысл \\"ловли\\" Z (от англ. зэд, обозначающего сон в популярных изображениях) реализуется через метафорическую ситуацию в лесу, где засыпание происходит невольно и мгновенно. 4. **Weight of the World Gym** - тренажерный зал, где героям предстоит поднять огромные веса. Это ссылка на выражение «нести тяжесть мира на своих плечах» (carry the weight of the world on one's shoulders), но в данном случае бремя и тяжесть мира буквально превращаются в упражнения с весами. 5. **Cup of Joe Café** - кафе, где каждый напиток напоминает или метафорически является «кубком Джо» - американским сленговым выражением для чашки кофе (cup of joe). Однако, в этой ситуации, кафе буквально превращается в место, где можно встретиться с Джо или любым другим человеком, создавая двусмысленность между именем и напитком. 6. **Bridge Over Troubled Waters** - мост, ведущий через бурные воды, который герои должны перейти, чтобы продолжить своё путешествие. Это отсылка к выражению «мост через бурные воды» (bridge over troubled waters), символизирующему помощь и поддержку в трудную минуту. Здесь метафора поддержки и спасения воплощена в прямом и буквальном смысле перехода через опасные воды. Каждый из этих примеров демонстрирует, как можно творчески использовать язык и его фразеологизмы для создания уникальных, запоминающихся моментов в рассказе, при этом обогащая текст юмором и глубиной."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Вот несколько примеров: 1. **The Whether Man** - Персонаж, встречающийся с Мило в начале его путешествия, называется \\"Whether Man\\", здесь игра слов на слова \\"whether\\" (ли) и \\"weather\\" (погода). Он постоянно говорит о прогнозе погоды, но его название также намекает на неопределенность или двусмысленность (whether) в повседневных решениях. 2. **Dictionopolis and Digitopolis** - Два города, словарный Дикционополис и цифровой Диджитополис, представляют соответственно слова и числа. Это названия отражают контраст и взаимодействие между лингвистической и математической интеллектуальной активностью, выражая концепцию различия между словами и числами в понимании мира. 3. **The Mountains of Ignorance** - Горы Невежества (Mountains of Ignorance) находятся на пути к Замку в Воздухе, где содержатся принцессы Рассудительность и Рассказка. Имена и локация символизируют препятствия невежества, которые нужно преодолеть, чтобы дойти до знания и просвещения. 4. **The Soundkeeper** - Хранительница Звуков (Soundkeeper) живет в месте, где хранятся и контролируются все звуки.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Søren Kierkegaard 1Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Refer to caption Figure 1:Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot direct-reasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2:Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 7. 2Related Work 2.1Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates.

Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters � with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that � * = arg ⁡ max � ⁡ � � ⁢ [ � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � � ⁢ ( � � : � | � 0 : � , rationale � ⁢ ( � 0 : � ) ) ] Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4Quiet-STaR 4.1Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across � tokens � � in an input sequence � 0 : � , we generate � rationales of length � : � � = ( � � ⁢ 1 , … , � � ⁢ � ) , resulting in � × � rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. Refer to caption Figure 3:Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. 4.2Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “ < � ⁢ � ⁢ � > the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3“Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the post-thought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”—”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. Refer to caption Figure 4:Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. 4.4.2Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � true next tokens � � + 1 : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � + 1 under the language model given previous observed tokens and a particular rationale ( � � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk as shorthand for the mixed prediction probabilities after thinking, see Algorithm 1). To reduce variance, we generate multiple rationale continuations for each token in the input sequence (loosely inspired by TRICE, Phan et al. (2023)). We thus define the reward � � for each rationale � � as the difference between � � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk and the average across rationales for that token ( � ¯ � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk ): � � = log ⁡ � � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk ⁢ ( � � + 1 : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � + 1 ) − log ⁡ � ¯ � : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � talk ⁢ ( � � + 1 : � + � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � + 1 ) We then use this reward in a REINFORCE loss term to update the language model parameters � to increase the likelihood of rationales that perform better than the average: ∇ � ℒ � REINFORCE = − � � ⋅ ∇ � log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � � | [ � : � ; <|startofthought|> ] ) We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, thought it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, ℒ � NLL , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1. 5Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2, as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. Refer to caption Figure 5:Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 5.1Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K ( 5.9 % → 8.1 % ) and CommonsenseQA ( 36.3 % → 42.6 % ) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. Refer to caption Figure 6:Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. 5.2Improvement Distribution As visualized in Figure 5, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Figure 6, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 6Discussion and Analysis 6.1Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these trade-offs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 6.2Examples While there is no explicit pressure in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be human-interpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. For reference, we include a few examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. ’<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. The chemical formula for this reaction is Mg+N_2-> MgN_2.

In chain-of-thought a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution; Quiet-STaR instead thinks quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. The two methods are likely complementary. For example, in the context where one might prompt a language model to use chain-of-thought, nothing prevents us from allowing the model to think before outputting each token of the rationale. We perform a preliminary experiment on this, suggesting that internal rationales may allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, described in Appendix E. 7Limitations This work proposes a new framework for learning to reason, and in doing so explores solutions to a variety of meta-learning challenges. However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix 7 for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 8Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. Ethics Statement This work raises some important ethical questions, many of which also apply to STaR. For example, it is impossible to know that the reasoning expressed by the model in language accurately represents the internal processing of the model (i.e., faithfulness). In addition, regardless of faithfulness, there are no safeguards against harmful or biased reasoning patterns if the model finds them useful. Relatedly, we note that CommonsenseQA is known to have many biased questions and low-quality answers (Geva et al., 2019), but we use it in line with prior work (Zelikman et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2023). Thus, aside from improving language modeling, it is unclear in what capacity the rationales themselves should be used.

Appendix Appendix AHyperparameter Choices Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of 1 ⁢ � − 6 , a weight decay of 0.001 , and a batch size of 8 (along with any necessary gradient accumulation to keep this fixed across runs). Moreover, our <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> embedding gradient weight is 1 ⁢ � ⁢ 2 and our policy weight is 1 ⁢ � ⁢ 6 . We sample with temperature � = 1 during training and use greedy decoding for the thoughts during evaluation. We treat our samples as importance samples by computing the REINFORCE loss at temperature � = 3 . Because we do not prompt the model with any examples, we directly compute the probability of the correct answer, conditioned on generating an answer – for example, for multiple choice questions between � ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ � , we compute the accuracy over the logits for tokens corresponding to � ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ � . Lastly, for our training, we select a random span of 256 tokens from each sample (or pad if there are fewer than 256 tokens). Mixing Head For our mixing head, we use a three-layer MLP with ReLU activation, taking in a vector of two times the size of the hidden state of the language model (as we concatenate the two predictions to determine their weights), and outputting a scalar. This scalar is them used to weight the logits from the LM head with and without thinking to make a prediction from a given token. Computation We train all of our models on a single node of eight 80GB H100s. Appendix BFaster Parallel Sampling In this section, we highlight some simple ways to further accelerate the parallel generation algorithm. For example, note that one can reduce the attention’s memory cost by computing the diagonal attention simply as elementwise (rather than pairwise) dot-products. That is, given two input embedding sequences of shapes ( � , � , � , � ) and ( � , 1 , � , � ) where � is the number of timesteps ahead, � is batch size, � is sequence length, and � is embedding dimension, we do not need to compute their pairwise attention of shape ( � , � , � , � ) , we only need to compute the attention for the paired elements along the diagonal of shape ( � , � , � ) . Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. Appendix CCompute-Adjusted Plots (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 7:Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. Appendix DMeasuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. Appendix ERationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature � = 1 . E.1Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let’s think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers’ market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let’s see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer’s market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer’s market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. For the first step, let’s think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet’s ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers’ market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that’s 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is Janet´s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you’ve done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part? You have Third Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let’s say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment. Our net wealth will be 12-5*12 = 24 dollars. Is that correct? Fourth Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, Jane’s ducks lay 16 eggs perday. So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 non-eaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers’ market. Lastly, she makes 12 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on in dollars every day at the farmers’ market. The worksheet below summarizes these steps. The number formed by the intersection of corresponding row and column terms will be the correct answer. The product of the (3, J) term and the (J, 8) term is 1,150. So, Janet makes 1,150 per day! (Note: Step 3 and Step 8 are repeating, but the (3,7) term in Step 8 is not the same as the (3,7) term in Step 3. ) Fifth Response <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. What do we know? - Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. - She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. From these two facts, we can conclude at least that Janet needs at least seven eggs for consumption per day. And what do we need to find exactly? - We need to find how much in dollars Janet makes every day at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation and solve it to find the answer. We know: - (16-3-4=9) So our daily profit is 9 times 2, or (9times2=18) Hence her profits at market on a given day are (18). Answer: (18).

A: 18 Appendix FAdditional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a code-improver using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes in-context (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning.\\"\\"","completion":"This paper introduces Quiet-STaR, a novel method for training language models (LMs) to generate internal rationalizations as a mechanism to enhance their reasoning capabilities. Unlike previous approaches which focus on explicit reasoning tasks or rely on carefully curated datasets, Quiet-STaR enables LMs to infer unstated logical steps directly from the breadth of general text. This approach is a significant step towards enabling LMs to self-improve their ability to reason in a more scalable and generalized manner. The core innovation of Quiet-STaR lies in its ability to teach LMs to \\"think before speaking,\\" mirroring human contemplation during communication. It extends the concept of the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), where LMs learn by inferring reasons that lead to correct answers in question-answering datasets. Quiet-STaR, however, does not limit itself to a specific task or dataset but applies this reasoning generation technique across arbitrary text, allowing the model to learn from the more diverse challenges present in language. It uses reinforced learning to encourage the generation of internal thoughts (rationales) that are helpful in predicting subsequent text and implements a novel parallel sampling algorithm and meta-token strategy to efficiently generate and utilize these rationales. The paper provides experimental evidence to support the efficacy of Quiet-STaR. By training on internet text corpora like OpenWebMath and C4, Quiet-STaR significantly improves zero-shot reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like CommonsenseQA and GSM8K without specific task fine-tuning. This enhancement is especially notable for tokens that are difficult to predict, demonstrating that the model benefits from the internal reasoning process. Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges in stabilizing the training process due to the dynamic nature of reasoning reward functions and the complexity of integrating internal reasoning without adversely affecting the model's base language performance. In summary, Quiet-STaR marks an innovative approach in training LMs to utilize internal rationalizations to improve reasoning, offering a more generalized, scalable way to leverage the implicit reasoning tasks across diverse texts. It opens avenues for future research in making LMs learn to reason more robustly and adaptably by teaching themselves from the vast expanse of available text, moving closer to mimicking human-like reasoning processes."},{"prompt":"write an email: Hello, Miss Lily, for the staff meeting today, I can't make it due to a lot of homework, Feiyan","completion":"Subject: Unable to Attend Staff Meeting Today Dear Miss Lily, I hope this email finds you well.

Her life and the diary she kept offer a deeply personal insight into the lives of Jews hiding from the Nazis, making her story a powerful reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust. # Early Life Anne Frank was born as Annelies Marie Frank on June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany, to Otto and Edith Frank. Due to the rising anti-Semitic laws and persecution in Germany following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the Frank family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, in the early 1930s, hoping for a safer life. However, when the Nazis occupied the Netherlands in 1940, the Franks' situation became perilous. # Going into Hiding In July 1942, after Margot Frank, Anne's older sister, received a call-up notice to report to a Nazi work camp, the Frank family went into hiding. They concealed themselves in a secret annex behind Otto Frank's business premises, along with four other Jews: Hermann and Auguste van Pels, their son Peter, and Fritz Pfeffer. During her time in hiding, Anne Frank began to write in a diary she had received for her 13th birthday, documenting her thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Her writing not only captures the fears and hardships of life in hiding but also reflects on her dreams, aspirations, and her struggles with growing up. # Discovery and Deportation After more than two years in hiding, the group was betrayed and discovered by the Nazis in August 1944. They were arrested and deported to concentration camps. Anne and Margot were eventually transferred to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where they both died of typhus in early 1945, just weeks before the camp was liberated by British troops. # The Diary After the war, Otto Frank, the sole survivor of the secret annex, returned to Amsterdam, where he was given Anne's diary, saved by Miep Gies, one of the helpers who had supported the hidden Jews. Recognizing the importance of his daughter's writings, Otto worked to get the diary published. In 1947, \\"The Diary of a Young Girl\\" was first published in the Netherlands and has since been translated into more than 70 languages. # Symbolism Anne Frank's diary serves as a powerful symbol of the loss of innocence and the cruelty of the Holocaust, highlighting the human capacity for both evil and immense strength and hope under dire circumstances. Her aspirations, thoughts, and resilience have made her a universal symbol for the rights of the oppressed and a voice against prejudice and discrimination. Her story humanizes the abstract horror of war, reminding us of the value of human rights and the importance of remembering and learning from the past. # Legacy Today, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam serves as a museum dedicated to her life, attracting visitors from all over the world. Anne Frank's story continues to inspire books, films, and plays, reflecting on themes of hope, freedom, and the need for mutual respect. Her diary remains one of the most poignant and widely read firsthand accounts of the Second World War, ensuring that the memory of the Holocaust and its lessons remain relevant today."},{"prompt":"Tell me about auschwitz and how the holocaust had a impact on people","completion":"Auschwitz, officially known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, was the largest and most infamous of the Nazi concentration and extermination camps, located in German-occupied Poland during World War II. Established in 1940 initially for Polish political prisoners, it evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi regime were exterminated through gas chambers, subjected to inhuman medical experiments, forced labor, starvation, and disease. More than 1.1 million men, women, and children lost their lives at Auschwitz, of which around 90% were Jews, making it a central symbol of the Holocaust's brutality. # Impact on People The Holocaust, the systematic effort by the Nazi regime to annihilate the Jewish people along with other perceived enemies, profoundly affected millions of lives across Europe and the world. Its impacts include: Immediate Human Cost - **Genocide**: Approximately six million Jews were murdered, representing two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population. Millions of others, including Roma, disabled individuals, Poles, Soviet POWs, and political dissidents, also perished. - **Families Torn Apart**: Countless families were separated, with many losing all or most of their members. The trauma of separation and loss had long-lasting emotional impacts. Psychological Impact - **Survivors' Guilt and Trauma**: Survivors often grappled with deep psychological trauma, including survivors’ guilt, nightmares, and PTSD. The psychological scars affected not only the survivors but also subsequent generations. - **Stigma and Isolation**: Returning survivors sometimes found themselves alienated from their communities or discovered that their communities had been destroyed or profoundly changed. Social and Cultural Effects - **Displacement**: The Holocaust created millions of refugees and displaced persons, many of whom lost their homes and communities. Post-war, many survivors emigrated to other countries, including the newly established state of Israel, the United States, Canada, and Australia. - **Loss of Cultural Heritage**: The extermination of entire communities led to the loss of centuries of Jewish cultural, intellectual, and social life in Europe. Legal and Political Consequences - **Nuremberg Trials**: The atrocities led to the Nuremberg Trials, where leading Nazis were prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, establishing precedents in international law. - **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**: In response to the Holocaust, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, aiming to protect individuals from persecution and ensure basic human rights globally. - **Formation of Israel**: The Holocaust was a significant factor leading to the establishment of Israel in 1948, offering a national home for Jews but also leading to decades of conflict in the Middle East. Education and Remembrance - **Holocaust Education**: The global community recognizes the importance of Holocaust education in combating anti-Semitism, racism, and promoting human rights. Museums, memorials, and education programs worldwide seek to preserve the memory of the victims and teach future generations. - **Moral and Ethical Reflection**: The Holocaust has prompted profound reflections on ethics, morality, and human nature. It serves as a grim reminder of the capacities for both evil and resilience within human society. The Holocaust had a deeply transformative impact on world history, individual lives, and collective memory. Its legacy is a poignant reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance and underscores the ongoing struggle to build a more just and compassionate world."},{"prompt":"create a list of all the dates realted to anne frank and the world war and hitler and the ww2 abd everything like when the war started and the dates","completion":"The timeline below encapsulates significant dates related to Anne Frank, World War II, Hitler, and other related historical milestones.

Where and likely route?","completion":"A hypothetical southern extension of the Victoria Line in London could be designed to serve areas that are currently less well-served by the Tube network, enhancing connectivity for South London. There are a few plausible directions such a project could take, based on considerations like demand, geographical constraints, and integration with existing and planned transportation infrastructure. # Likely Direction and Route The most discussed and plausible direction for a southern extension of the Victoria Line would likely aim towards either the South-East or South-West London corridors due to their relatively higher population density and economic activity. Given the Victoria Line currently terminates at Brixton, extending further into South London makes strategic sense. # Option 1: South-East Extension An extension towards the South-East could aim to connect Brixton with Lewisham, potentially serving key areas and transport interchanges along the route. Possible intermediary stops could include: 1. **Herne Hill** - Serving as a local hub and connecting existing rail services. 2. **Dulwich Village** or **East Dulwich** - Providing service to a populous area of South London currently reliant on bus and overground services. 3. **Catford/Catford Bridge** - Another important transport interchange, enhancing connectivity to Southeastern rail services. 4. **Lewisham** - A major transport hub that would connect the extended Victoria Line with the DLR, Southeastern Rail, and the Elizabeth Line (via a change at Canary Wharf). # Option 2: South-West Extension A South-West extension could aim towards Croydon, another significant South London hub with substantial commercial activity and development plans. This route might look like: 1. **Streatham Hill** or **Streatham** - Serving a densely populated area with high public transport demand. 2. **Norbury** - Providing an interchange with Southern Rail services. 3. **Thornton Heath** - Serving another residential area and potentially improving transport links to Croydon University Hospital. 4. **West Croydon**/*East Croydon* - Final stop at one of Croydon's major transport interchanges, connecting with tram services, bus services, and National Rail. # Considerations - **Funding and Feasibility**: Major infrastructure projects in London are highly costly and need substantial justification through demand and economic benefit analyses. Funding would likely require public and private investment. - **Integration with Other Plans**: Any extension would need to consider other ongoing and future transport projects, such as the planned expansion of the DLR and the proposed Bakerloo line extension. - **Environmental and Community Impact**: High-density areas might benefit significantly from improved public transport, but projects would need to carefully negotiate issues of land use, displacement, and environmental impact. # Conclusion While these ideas are purely speculative and based on strategic considerations, any actual plan for extending the Victoria Line or other parts of the London Underground network would undergo detailed feasibility studies, public consultations, and financial analyses. The decision would ultimately balance improvements in connectivity and capacity with considerations of cost, environmental impact, and community feedback."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Transport Project: What would a Bristol Metro need in terms of new construction? (Use exisiting rail infrastructure as far as possible)","completion":"Creating a metro system for Bristol, a city known for its rich maritime history and vibrant culture but also for its challenging topography and traffic congestion, would require a multifaceted approach. Incorporating existing rail infrastructure as much as possible, the project would still necessitate significant new construction and modifications to create a fully functional and efficient metro system. Here's an outline of what such a project might involve: # 1. Upgrading Existing Rail Lines - **Electrification and Double Tracking:** Many existing rail lines around Bristol may require electrification to support a frequent metro service. Additionally, sections of single track would likely need upgrading to double track to increase capacity and reduce wait times. - **Signalling Upgrades:** State-of-the-art signalling systems would be essential to safely manage increased train frequencies. # 2. New Stations and Existing Station Overhauls - **Accessibility Upgrades:** Existing stations would need to be made fully accessible, with the addition of lifts, improved lighting, and clearer signage. - **New Metro Stations:** To fill gaps in the network and serve densely populated areas better, new stations would be required. These stations should be compact and integrated into the urban fabric to encourage foot traffic and connections with bus services. - **Park and Ride Facilities:** Outskirts stations could benefit from Park and Ride facilities to encourage commuters from surrounding areas to use the metro. # 3. Integration with Other Modes of Transport - **Bus Service Integration:** A key aspect of the metro project would be seamless integration with Bristol’s bus network, including real-time information and ticketing compatibility. - **Cycling Infrastructure:** Secure bike storage and cycling lanes leading to and from stations would encourage eco-friendly first and last-mile connectivity. # 4. Additional Rail Lines or Tunnels - **Cross-City Connections:** Depending on the layout of existing infrastructure, new rail lines or tunnels might be necessary to create efficient cross-city routes, avoiding bottlenecks and reducing the need for transfers. - **Waterfront Line:** Considering Bristol's geography, a metro line serving the waterfront areas could revitalize neighborhoods and boost tourism but might require new tracks or even underground sections. # 5. Fleet and Facilities - **Rolling Stock:** A fleet of electric, driverless (optionally) trains could offer high frequency, safety, and efficiency. - **Maintenance Depots:** New or expanded depots would be required for the maintenance and storage of the metro fleet. # 6. Urban Planning and Community Impact - **Public Consultation:** Engaging with communities from the planning stage to implementation would be crucial to address concerns and incorporate local insights. - **Zoning and Development:** Metro construction could be coordinated with urban development projects, using the transport upgrades to stimulate housing and commercial opportunities around stations. # Conclusion Developing a metro for Bristol that leverages existing rail infrastructure would still be a significant undertaking requiring careful planning, considerable investment, and collaboration between different levels of government, the private sector, and the community.

This initiative could significantly enhance local mobility, leveraging a unique part of the city's heritage. Here is an outline for such a project: # 1. **Infrastructure Planning** **Identify Main Corridors and Stops**: Key corridors would likely include routes serving major residential, commercial, and tourist areas such as Brighton city center, Hove, Brighton Marina, and universities. Stops would be strategically located at key points of interest, commuter hubs, and residential areas to maximize coverage and convenience. **Track Construction**: Given this is a new tram system, constructing dedicated tram lines or shared roadways aligned with the gauge of Volk's Railway is crucial. These tracks would enable smooth transitions between different parts of the city while minimizing disruption to existing road traffic. **Integration with Volk's Railway**: Utilizing the same gauge enables the potential for physical and operational integration with Volk's Railway, transforming it from a tourist attraction into a functional part of the city's public transport network. # 2. **Vehicle Procurement** **Acquiring Modern Trams**: The system would require a fleet of modern, low-floor trams for accessibility, capable of operating at a higher speed and frequency than the historic Volk's Railway trains. These vehicles would be designed to reflect Brighton and Hove's vibrant urban culture and environmental sustainability goals. # 3. **Station Design** **Accessibility and Amenities**: Stations need to be fully accessible, with step-free access, real-time information displays, ticketing machines, and shelter. Provisions for bicycles, offering facilities like bike racks or bike hire stations, would encourage multimodal transport use. **Heritage Integration**: The design of stations and tram livery could incorporate elements that reflect the city's seaside heritage and the historical significance of Volk's Railway. # 4. **Urban Integration** **Street and Pedestrian Area Upgrades**: Implementing the tram system will provide an opportunity to enhance urban spaces, potentially pedestrianizing more areas, upgrading landscaping, and improving street furniture in line with the new tram infrastructure. **Multimodal Connections**: Ensuring that tram stops are co-located with bus stops where possible, and close to car parks for park-and-ride facilities, would improve the system's integration with other transport modes. # 5. **Operational Considerations** **Frequency and Timetable**: The tram service would need to offer a high frequency, especially during peak times and in the summer months when tourist activity is high. **Pricing and Ticketing**: Implementing a simple, straightforward pricing and ticketing system, possibly integrated with other local transport services, would be essential for encouraging adoption. # 6. **Community and Environmental Benefits** **Public Consultation**: Engaging with local communities, businesses, and stakeholders right from the planning stage to gather input and address concerns. **Sustainability Focus**: By promoting public transport and potentially reducing car usage, the tram system would contribute to lower emissions and less congestion, aligning with broader environmental objectives. # Conclusion A pre-metro/tram system in Brighton and Hove, designed with careful consideration for the city's unique culture, heritage, and modern transport needs, could significantly enhance local mobility and sustainability.

Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Søren Kierkegaard 1Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Refer to caption Figure 1:Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot direct-reasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2:Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 7. 2Related Work 2.1Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. _ ⁢ steps Algorithm 1 Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) 2.2Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters � with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. 4Quiet-STaR 4.1Overview Quiet-STaR operates with three main steps (Figure 1): 1. Parallel rationale generation (think, Subsection 4.2): In parallel across � tokens � � in an input sequence � 0 : � , we generate � rationales of length � : � � = ( � � ⁢ 1 , … , � � ⁢ � ) , resulting in � × � rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. Refer to caption Figure 3:Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. 4.2Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “ < the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3“Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the post-thought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”—”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. Refer to caption Figure 4:Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. 4.4.2Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, thought it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, ℒ � NLL , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1. 5Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2, as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. Refer to caption Figure 5:Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 5.1Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K ( 5.9 % → 8.1 % ) and CommonsenseQA ( 36.3 % → 42.6 % ) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. Refer to caption Figure 6:Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. 5.2Improvement Distribution As visualized in Figure 5, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Figure 6, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 6Discussion and Analysis 6.1Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these trade-offs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 6.2Examples While there is no explicit pressure in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be human-interpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. For reference, we include a few examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. ’<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. The chemical formula for this reaction is Mg+N_2-> MgN_2.

In chain-of-thought a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution; Quiet-STaR instead thinks quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. The two methods are likely complementary. For example, in the context where one might prompt a language model to use chain-of-thought, nothing prevents us from allowing the model to think before outputting each token of the rationale. We perform a preliminary experiment on this, suggesting that internal rationales may allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, described in Appendix E. 7Limitations This work proposes a new framework for learning to reason, and in doing so explores solutions to a variety of meta-learning challenges. However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix 7 for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 8Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of . Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. Appendix CCompute-Adjusted Plots (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 7:Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. Appendix DMeasuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. Appendix ERationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature � = 1 . E.1Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let’s think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers’ market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let’s see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer’s market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer’s market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. For the first step, let’s think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet’s ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers’ market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that’s 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we’re given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is Janet´s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you’ve done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let’s say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 non-eaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers’ market.

A: 18 Appendix FAdditional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a code-improver using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes in-context (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning.","completion":"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking,\\" authored by Eric Zelikman and others from Stanford University and Notbad AI Inc, introduces a novel approach for improving language models (LMs) through self-taught reasoning abilities derived from general text. It builds on and extends the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) framework introduced in previous works, aiming to imbue LMs with the capability to infer unstated rationales or underlying reasoning in texts to make better predictions. The core insight driving the work is that reasoning is an implicit aspect of all written text, not just explicit question-answering (QA) or problem-solving contexts. This realization opens up the possibility of leveraging the vast sea of unstructured text available on the Internet as a learning ground for language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities. The method, dubbed Quiet-STaR, has LMs self-generate rationales at every token in a given text, explaining the text that follows, which significantly improves the model's prediction accuracy. This self-instructed mechanism allows the model to \\"think before it speaks,\\" mirroring human introspective reasoning processes. Key achievements of the Quiet-STaR methodology include: 1. **Generalization to Arbitrary Texts**: By training on internet text corpora, Quiet-STaR enables LMs to develop reasoning skills not tied to specific tasks or datasets, enhancing generality and scalability. 2. **Improved Prediction through Rationale Generation**: The method works by generating \\"thought tokens\\" at each position in a text sequence, which guide the model in predicting subsequent text more accurately. 3. **Efficiency and Scalability**: Implements a parallel sampling algorithm and an extended teacher-forcing technique to manage computational costs without compromising performance. 4. **Significant Zero-shot Performance Gains**: Demonstrates substantial improvements on challenging datasets like GSM8K and CommonsenseQA without fine-tuning, illustrating the effectiveness of internal thought generation in enhancing reasoning capabilities. Despite increasing the computational overhead due to rationale generation, the approach presents an innovative way to utilize additional compute for enhancing next-token prediction quality, demonstrating an important step toward LMs with intrinsic reasoning abilities. Quiet-STaR operates under the philosophy that language models can be unsupervised multitask learners, tapping into their latent reasoning abilities to improve understanding and generation of text. It signals a shift towards more intelligent and autonomous language models capable of learning and improving from the vast and diverse content available online, embodying a promising direction for AI research in natural language understanding and generation."},{"prompt":"Please summarize with a deep understanding: \\"\\" arXiv:2403.09629v1 [cs.CL] 14 Mar 2024 UseRawInputEncoding Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking Eric Zelikman Stanford University &Georges Harik Notbad AI Inc &Yijia Shao Stanford University &Varuna Jayasiri Notbad AI Inc &Nick Haber Stanford University &Noah D. Goodman Stanford University Abstract When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting – ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought’s start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM’s ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way. “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” — Søren Kierkegaard 1Introduction Much of the meaning of text is hidden between the lines: without understanding why statements appear in a document, a reader has only a shallow understanding. Moreover, this has been repeatedly shown to be true for LMs as well, in the contexts of tasks ranging from commonsense reasoning to theorem proving to programming (Wei et al., 2022b; Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; 2023a; Kojima et al., 2022). Reasoning about implications of text to predict later text has consistently been shown to improve LM performance on a variety of tasks, but methods for allowing LMs to learn from their reasoning (e.g., Zelikman et al. 2022) have focused on solving individual tasks or predefined sets of tasks (e.g., Wei et al. 2021b). These works rely on carefully curated datasets to provide either specific reasoning tasks or in some cases, the reasoning itself. We instead ask, if reasoning is implicit in all text, why shouldn’t we leverage the task of language modeling to teach reasoning? In particular, the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022) showed that LMs can bootstrap their reasoning ability on question-answering (QA) datasets by sampling rationales to attempt to answer questions, training on rationales if they led to a correct final answer, and then repeating this to iteratively solve more difficult problems. Yet, training from curated QA datasets limits the scale and generalizability of the rationales. QA datasets, especially high-quality ones, require thoughtful curation and will inherently only ever cover a subset of reasoning tasks. Thus, we extend STaR – instead of the LM learning to reason on particular tasks like mathematical QA, we train an LM to generate reasoning that helps it infer future text from a large internet text corpus. As a result, we allow the LM to learn from the diverse tasks present in language (Weber et al., 2021). This builds on an intuition essential to the current language modeling paradigm, namely, that ”language models are unsupervised multitask learners” (Radford et al., 2019). Thus, as in STaR, we leverage the LM’s pre-existing reasoning ability to generate rationales and train the LM on them with a REINFORCE-based reward (Williams, 1992). We refer to this technique as Quiet-STaR, as it can be understood as applying STaR “quietly”, training the model to think before it speaks. Refer to caption Figure 1:Quiet-STaR. We visualize the algorithm as applied during training to a single thought. We generate thoughts, in parallel, following all tokens in the text (think). The model produces a mixture of its next-token predictions with and without a thought (talk). We apply REINFORCE, as in STaR, to increase the likelihood of thoughts that help the model predict future text while discarding thoughts that make the future text less likely (learn). Broadly, Quiet-STaR proceeds by generating rationales after every token to explain future text (think), mixing the future-text predictions with and without rationales (talk), and then learning to generate better rationales using REINFORCE (learn). We apply Quiet-STaR to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) using the web text datasets OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4, Raffel et al. 2020). We find that, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, Quiet-STaR results in improvements to zero-shot direct-reasoning abilities on CommonsenseQA (36.3% → 47.2%) and GSM8K (5.9% → 10.9%), and that these improvements consistently increase with the number of tokens used in the LM’s internal thoughts. Lastly, we qualitatively investigate patterns in the generated rationales. In solving this task, we make the following contributions: 1. We generalize STaR to learn reasoning from diverse unstructured text data. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly training LMs to reason generally from text, rather than on curated reasoning tasks or collections of reasoning tasks. 2. We propose and implement a parallel sampling algorithm that makes our training procedure scalable, generating rationales from all token positions in a given string. 3. We introduce custom meta-tokens at the start and end of each thought to allow the LM to learn that it should be generating a rationale and when it should make a prediction based on that rationale. 4. We apply a mixing head to retrospectively determine how much to incorporate the next-token prediction from a given thought into the current next-token prediction. 5. We show that a non-myopic loss, including multiple tokens ahead for language modeling, improves the effect of thinking. 6. On multiple tasks, we demonstrate that thinking allows the LM to predict difficult tokens better than one trained on the same web text, improving with longer thoughts. (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 2:Generalization Results. We evaluate the extent to which the model trained with Quiet-STaR generalizes to directly answering problems that require reasoning. The left plot (a) shows the zero-shot accuracy on GSM8K, while the right plot (b) shows the zero-shot accuracy on CommonsenseQA, without any fine-tuning. In both plots, the x-axis represents training steps, and each line corresponds to a different number of thinking tokens used during Quiet-STaR training. The y-axis measures the zero-shot direct accuracy on the respective datasets. We also include an inference normalized version of this plot in Figure 7. 2Related Work 2.1Reasoning in Language Models There have been many works on training and exploiting language models to solve difficult tasks by first training them to reason through them. For example, Rajani et al. (2019) demonstrated that a pre-trained language model fine-tuned to output on human reasoning traces before answering multiple-choice commonsense reasoning questions outperformed one trained directly on answers. Shwartz et al. (2020) demonstrated that language models, when provided with some scaffolding, can generate these helpful chain-of-thought solutions without additional supervision. Later, Nye et al. (2021) demonstrated that “scratchpads” required less scaffolding when the language models were more capable, a result later reinforced by Wei et al. (2022b), emphasizing informal tasks, and further strengthened by Kojima et al. (2022), demonstrating this behavior could be accomplished zero-shot. Most recently, Wang & Zhou (2024) showed further that for commonsense-question answering, one could force a language model to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by preventing it from emitting any valid answer tokens unless it was confident. However, once again, these approaches only work for a question-answer dataset, and Wang & Zhou (2024) relies on heuristics to identify when the model has output answer tokens. Somewhat like TRICE (Phan et al., 2023), we use the relative improvements in the log-likelihood of the target text across rationales as an estimate of quality, but we simply subtract the mean reward and do not incorporate more complex control variates. _ ⁢ steps Algorithm 1 Quiet Self-Taught Reasoner (Quiet-STaR) 2.2Training Language Models to Reason One direction that researchers have used to train language models to reason or improve their reasoning is training the language model on mined reasoning traces or reasoning-like data (Rajani et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2021a; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Gunasekar et al., 2023). Although this approach has been demonstrated to be effective, it comes with drawbacks. It requires either manual annotation, which is sensitive to the capability of the annotators and is off-policy for the language model (i.e., the distribution of reasoning is not text that the language model would otherwise likely have generated). This approach is also expensive, difficult to scale, and provides no clear path to solving problems harder than those that the annotators are capable of solving. Another direction for teaching reasoning relies on a language model’s own generated reasoning, which can be seen as building on a large body of literature on self-play (Silver et al., 2017; Anthony et al., 2017; Polu & Sutskever, 2020). These include methods such as the Self-Taught Reasoner (Zelikman et al., 2022), which demonstrated that a language model iteratively trained on its reasoning that led to correct answers could solve increasingly difficult problems. Later work aimed to leverage additional information or assumptions such as Huang et al. (2022) which demonstrated that the algorithm proposed in STaR could still work if one assumed that the majority-vote answer was correct (although this has a lower ultimate performance). Further work has generalized the results of Zelikman et al. (2022), such as Uesato et al. (2022) which demonstrated additional usefulness to “process-based” supervision where incorrect reasoning traces were filtered, recently V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) that demonstrates that training a verifier to guide generation also improves performance, as well as TRICE (Hoffman et al., 2024) which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the correct answer given several reasoning traces per problem. Finally, related work has also explored learning intermediate reasoning in the constrained setting of making mathematical statements, where statements in the model’s intermediate reasoning could be constrained to only be valid mathematical statements (Poesia et al., 2023). We include further discussion of related reasoning works in Appendix F. 2.3Meta-tokens Recently, a growing body of work has demonstrated the usefulness of custom tokens optimized to perform specific functions in the context of a neural network – for this reason, they have also been referred to as “function vectors.” (Todd et al., 2023). One of the original instantiations of this was prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021) (and relatedly prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021)), where the embeddings corresponding to the tokens of a prompt could be optimized to better accomplish a task. Others have applied meta-tokens to compress long prompts (Li et al., 2023; Jung & Kim, 2023) for efficiency. Most relevant to this work, Mu et al. (2024) optimized a token such that, when the tokens after it could not attend to the tokens before it (i.e., a context compression token), it would provide sufficient information to future tokens. Although we do not focus on compression, we share the problem of learning a token that affects attention and controls complex downstream behavior. In one related work, Goyal et al. (2023) show that learning a single ”pause” token (essentially representing each token as two tokens) improves LM performance. However, unlike the thought tokens in our work, this pause token does not initialize a thought – instead, it can be seen as acting as the entirety of the thought. We find that reasoning in language is significantly more helpful. 3Problem Statement In this work, we introduce an auxiliary ‘rationale’ variable between each pair of observed tokens of the sequence. We then aim to optimize a language model with parameters with the capacity to generate intermediate thoughts (or rationales) such that Note that, in principle, this provides no advantage over an optimal language model that already correctly models the language’s distribution over strings. Yet, in practice, extensive prior work has shown that language models benefit from intermediate rationales on reasoning tasks (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b). Some work has aimed to explain the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, namely attributing it to “locality of experience” (Prystawski et al., 2024). More broadly, reasoning allows a model to decompose a challenging computation into smaller steps. In effect, we train the model to learn which decomposition and planning steps are effective in predicting future text. Also note that we formulate the objective as accurately predicting the remaining sequence, rather than only the next token. Once again, for an optimal LM these would be equivalent. However we find that the non-myopic formulation leads to a more effective loss for learning rationales. rationale candidates. We insert learned <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens to mark each rationale’s start and end. 2. Mixing post-rationale and base predictions (talk, Subsection 4.3): From the hidden state output after each rationale, we train a ”mixing head” – a shallow MLP producing a weight determining how much the post-rationale next-token predicted logits should be incorporated compared to the base language model predicted logits. This approach eases distribution shift early in finetuning, due to introducing rationales. 3. Optimizing rationale generation (learn, Subsection 4.4): We optimize the rationale generation parameters (start/end tokens and LM weights) to increase the likelihood of rationales that make future text more probable. We use REINFORCE to provide a learning signal to rationales based on their impact on future-token prediction. To reduce variance, we apply a teacher-forcing trick to include in the loss the likelihood of predicting not only the token after the thought but also later tokens. Refer to caption Figure 3:Parallel Generation. By constructing an attention mask that allows all thought tokens to pay attention to themselves, all preceding thought tokens within the same thought, and the preceding text, we can generate continuations of all of the thoughts in parallel. Each inference call is used to generate one additional thought token for all text tokens. 4.2Parallel Generation A key challenge in Quiet-STaR is efficiently generating rationales at each token position in the input sequence. Naively, this would require a separate forward pass for each token, which becomes computationally intractable for long sequences. We allow for highly parallel generation by first observing that an inference pass of a language model produces a probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. Naturally, this allows us to sample one next token from each token in the input. If one has generated a successor from each token, it is not possible to simply continue with the original sequence. For example, imagine predicting the next token after each token of “ < the cat sat” one might generate “yes orange saw down” – each successor by itself is a reasonable next token to a prefix of the sequence, but the list of tokens is a set of “counterfactual” continuations of these prefixes. We can, however, leverage these continuations to generate hidden thoughts for each observed token. To do this efficiently, we cache each forward pass and concatenate a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask: each generated token now attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as to itself (but not to token on other “counterfactual” paths). Moreover, this parallelized next-sampling token procedure can be repeated arbitrarily many times (or at least, until one runs out of memory). We visualize this procedure in Figure 3 and highlight additional ways to make this algorithm faster in Appendix B. 4.3“Mixing” (Residual) Heads When starting with a pre-trained model, thoughts will initially be out of distribution, and hence harm language modeling performance. To smooth the transition to thinking, we introduce a learned interpolation between the LM predictions with and without thoughts. Given the end-of-thought token’s hidden state and the hidden state of the original text token, the mixing head outputs a weight that determines the extent to which the post-thought prediction logits will be used. We use a shallow multi-layer perceptron for this head, outputting a scalar for each token. We include implementation details in Appendix A. 4.4Optimizing Rationale Generation 4.4.1Optimizing Start-of-Thought and End-of-Thought Tokens The <|startofthought|> and <|endofthought|> tokens serve as learned meta-tokens that control the model’s rationale generation. Optimizing the representation of these tokens, especially the <|startofthought|> token, is crucial but challenging due to the discrete nature of the rationale tokens. We initialize the start and end token embeddings to the embedding corresponding to the em dash, ”—”, which often appears in text data to denote a pause or thought. This leverages the language model’s preexisting knowledge. In addition, to allow these embeddings to be optimized more quickly, we apply a (hyperparameter) weight to the gradients of these embeddings during the update step. Intuitively, the start thought tokens can be understood as putting the model into a “thinking mode” and the end thought token can be understood as telling the model when it’s done thinking. Refer to caption Figure 4:Forward Pass and Teacher Forcing. We visualize a single forward pass of our algorithm. Solid lines denote language model computation, while dashed lines indicate tokens are inserted via teacher forcing, and the mixer represents the mixing head. In particular, we visualize predicting three tokens ahead. Thought generation is shown in more detail in Figure 1 and Figure 3. 4.4.2Non-myopic Scoring and Teacher-forcing Because we do not expect thoughts to be useful in predicting every token, we would prefer the model’s reward to depend less on the exact next word in the text following the thought and more on the following semantic content. There are two primary challenges here. First, unlike in typical language modeling with transformers, only the thoughts corresponding to a given next-token prediction receive a gradient from that prediction—a consequence of our parallel sampling strategy. We could address this by adding loss terms for future tokens by sampling the tokens before. However this would result in much higher entropy for language modeling in general and lower-quality generated text, because it would train the LM to partially disregard its preceding tokens. Instead, we use the parallel attention mask to compute the log probabilities of the true next tokens, applying teacher forcing by assuming the model selected the correct next ground-truth token (as implicit in normal language modeling with transformers). Note that the loss for each future token also depends on a mixing weight computed from the end thought token and the previous observed token. The number of future tokens included in the loss is a hyper-parameter. We apply the same teacher-forcing technique to insert the start and end tokens. We visualize this procedure in Figure 4. 4.4.3Objective We use REINFORCE to optimize the likelihoods of the rationales based on their usefullness: the log-likelihood of the We found it useful to exclude the negative reward from the REINFORCE loss term, as it led to more stable training, thought it may introduce some bias. This loss term encourages the model to generate rationales that improve its predictions of future tokens compared to the average prediction across all generated rationales for that token. The gradients from this loss are used to update both the LM parameters and the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings, with a (hyperparameter) weight applied to the gradients of the start-of-thought and end-of-thought token embeddings to accelerate their optimization. By iteratively optimizing these parameters, Quiet-STaR trains the model to generate more useful rationales throughout training. Lastly, we also include a log-likelihood loss, ℒ � NLL , to ensure that the LM learns to optimize the talking heads and also receives a next-token prediction signal for the base LM head1. 5Experiments and Results Intuitively, not all tokens require equal amounts of thought. For example, consider the sentence “the person is run-”: although there is inevitably some probability of the token being something other than “ing”2, as a standalone sentence without context, additional thinking is unlikely to improve a well-trained model’s prediction. Indeed, we conjecture that for most chunks of most online text, additional thought has little to no impact. Indeed, early in our exploration we observed that Quiet-STaR does not benefit all tokens equally. Thus, we design our experiments to investigate whether our approach is useful in predicting tokens that do require thought. We evaluate 1) whether Quiet-STaR improves a language model’s ability to directly predict answers in datasets that require reasoning; and, 2) the distribution of impacts resulting from thinking tokens. We conduct all of our experiments starting with the base version of Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We perform most of our experiments by training on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a crawl that emphasizes more technical webpages. We selected OpenWebMath because we anticipated that it would have a higher density of tokens that benefit from reasoning, which our experiments support. We also evaluate Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), a widely used LM pretraining corpus with more diverse text, and again show significant albeit smaller benefits. Refer to caption Figure 5:Distribution of changes in log probability. We visualize the distribution of changes in log probability resulting from the generated thoughts across the evaluation dataset. We visualize the density of changes in log probability relative to the LM without thoughts, colored based on log density. The distribution is skewed, with most tokens unaffected, while a small fraction of hard tokens see substantial improvements from the thoughts. This matches our intuition that most tokens in general web text do not require significant reasoning to predict, but thoughts are disproportionately beneficial for challenging tokens. 5.1Downstream Performance In this subsection, we evaluate the extent to which Quiet-STaR improves the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of the language model on CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). On CommonsenseQA, we find that Quiet-STaR improves performance by 10.9% compared to the base language model. As shown in Figure 2, this improvement consistently increases with the number of tokens used in the model’s rationales, indicating that more thorough reasoning through the thought tokens is translating to better direct question-answering performance. Similarly, on GSM8K, Quiet-STaR results in a 5.0% boost over the base model, and once again, performance scales with the length of the rationales generated during Quiet-STaR training. For reference, in Figure 2, we include a baseline corresponding to training the same model on the same dataset without thought tokens. We observe that in multiple curves, performance appears to eventually deteriorate – we anticipate that this is because we are not training on these downstream tasks, so the roles of the thought tokens may change over time. We also find a benefit of our non-myopic objective, which we discuss in Appendix D. We find that training with Quiet-STaR on C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) also improves performance on GSM8K ( 5.9 % → 8.1 % ) and CommonsenseQA ( 36.3 % → 42.6 % ) but by a smaller margin. Specifically, for our C4 evaluation, we train Mistral 7B with 16 thought tokens and 4 true tokens ahead and otherwise the same setup. We can compare these improvements to those offered by pause tokens (Goyal et al., 2023), which can be seen as a constrained version of Quiet-STaR where each token is represented by two tokens and the second ”pause” token acts as the entirety of the thought. In particular, our setup is most comparable to their pause token fine-tuning, as we also finetune a pretrained model. Their results indicate that pause token fine-tuning also provides minor gains over the base model on CommonsenseQA, they observed an improvement from 26.9% to 28.8%; on GSM8K, Goyal et al. (2023) found that pause token fine-tuning harms performance. Moreover, on both tasks (and the majority of their evaluated tasks), they observed that additional thought tokens harmed performance. Moreover, they discuss the “lukewarm effect of pause-finetuning a standard-pretrained model” (Goyal et al., 2023). This suggests that allowing the model to generate multi-token rationales leads to more effective reasoning compared to the single-token ”pauses”. Note however, that unlike Goyal et al. (2023), we do not fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Overall, these downstream results validate that training a language model to predict the subtext between the lines of general text data can substantially improve its reasoning capabilities, even on datasets it was not explicitly trained on. The fact that longer rationales consistently lead to better outcomes, and that Quiet-STaR outperforms the constrained pause token approach, supports the notion that Quiet-STaR is successfully teaching the model to leverage its own generated thoughts to reason more thoroughly about the input. Refer to caption Figure 6:Contribution Visualization. We provide an example text where we visualize the degree to which introducing thoughts helped at tokens throughout a text. Green indicates that the thought before that token made that token easier to predict, while yellow indicates that it made it harder to predict. More impactful thoughts have higher opacity. 5.2Improvement Distribution As visualized in Figure 5, we find that on average there is little improvement in the LM’s ability to predict arbitrary tokens. But, when we visualize the distribution of relative improvements, there is a disproportionate improvement on more difficult tokens. This reflects the idea that some text tokens are substantially harder and benefit more from careful thought. In Figure 6, we aim to provide some insight into the kinds of tokens where the improvements occur. Namely, while thinking appears to help for many tokens in the example, inspection suggests it disproportionately help to predict tokens where recalling relevant information is useful, such as the name of an applicable theorem or the start of the next step in a proof. Notably, this would align well with the framing proposed by Prystawski et al. (2024). 6Discussion and Analysis 6.1Handling Instability Several aspects of this task have the potential to introduce instability. First, and perhaps most importantly, the utility of a generated thought (or thought token) is a function of the mapping from the thought to its contribution to language prediction; however, the mapping from the thoughts to this contribution is learned based on the thoughts themselves. This means that, even if one were to generate a thought that allowed the perfect prediction of the next token, the loss could receive no signal from it if the mixing head’s weight on that generation was 0. One solution we explored was to use the Gumbel-Softmax trick with a straight-through estimator Jang et al. (2016), but with many consecutive softmax operations we observed vanishing gradients. This introduces an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Approaches like DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016) often resolve these trade-offs by learning a state value function, which estimates the expected future reward from each state. However, the reward functions associated with this environment are unstable (as noted earlier, due to the also-changing mixing heads) – consequently, our preliminary explorations with these techniques was not promising. While we are far from the first to note that optimizing rationales is a reinforcement-learning task (Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang & Parkes, 2023; Phan et al., 2023), the need for the rationale to avoid harming the base model performance introduces additional complexity. Essentially, the more complex the mapping from LM output to the next token prediction, the more instability we observed. On the other hand, when we trained without any interpolation, i.e. ablating the mixing head and only using the language model prediction after thoughts, the model quickly learned to simply ignore the thoughts (and we saw no generalization to any downstream tasks). We explored the use of separate heads for thinking and talking (here, we use talking to refer to directly outputting a hidden state or logits, rather than a mixing weight). In particular, we explored both linear layers from the hidden states and MLPs, initialized to contribute 0 residually to the base language model outputs, in order to generate thoughts and next-token predictions similar to what the language model would have otherwise generated. However, we observed that, in all instances, the previously-mentioned instability prevented learning. Consequently, we aimed to remove or minimize all components that could transform the language model’s outputs, both with and without its rationales. We also note that our choice to use a language model to output a weight combining multiple states (as done by our mixing head) is essentially an attention mechanism allowing the model to attend to its thinking. This has similarity to the approach taken in Backpack language models (Hewitt et al., 2023), which also learn to predict weights to apply to summed input embeddings to model future text, rather than allowing the language model to output arbitrary embeddings. Despite this constraint, Backpack language models appear to have comparable performance to traditional language models (Hewitt et al., 2023). 6.2Examples While there is no explicit pressure in Quiet-STaR for thoughts to be human-interpretable, they are generated from the same transformer trained to model language, hence likely to be at least partially understandable. For reference, we include a few examples of thoughts generated that were helpful to the model in predicting future tokens in OpenWebMath. First, in one case, recalling that one should start with magnesium to produce magnesium nitride allows it to better predict that the first step of the procedure involves heating magnesium. ’<s> # Magnesium reacts with nitrogen to form magnesium nitride. The chemical formula for this reaction is Mg+N_2-> MgN_2.

In chain-of-thought a user actively prompts the model to think ‘out loud’, otherwise using its ordinary production distribution; Quiet-STaR instead thinks quietly at every token, with a distribution trained to be useful. The two methods are likely complementary. For example, in the context where one might prompt a language model to use chain-of-thought, nothing prevents us from allowing the model to think before outputting each token of the rationale. We perform a preliminary experiment on this, suggesting that internal rationales may allow the model to generate more structured and coherent chains of thought, described in Appendix E. 7Limitations This work proposes a new framework for learning to reason, and in doing so explores solutions to a variety of meta-learning challenges. However, to solve these challenges, certain simplifications were necessary. For example, it would be valuable to understand whether these techniques work when a model is trained from scratch. We have also only applied Quiet-STaR to a 7 billion parameter model, albeit a powerful one. The same techniques applied to a better model would likely yield disproportionately better results, as has often been observed for gains from reasoning (Wei et al., 2022a). Quiet-STaR results in a substantial overhead, generating many tokens before generating every additional token. (See Appendix 7 for compute adjusted performance results.) However, this can also be seen as an advantage: typically, a language model can generate the next token based on the current context, and while there are techniques to improve sampling quality, there is no general way to leverage additional compute to enhance next-token prediction. In the current implementation we do not support dynamically predicting when to generate, or end, a rationale. However, this would be a natural extension. For instance, if the mixing head was a prediction from the base language model, before any thought, rather than after the thought, one could apply a threshold to prevent generating thoughts that would not be incorporated. We expect that this is a more difficult task, as predicting the usefulness of a thought is simpler when one has already generated the thought. 8Conclusion Quiet-STaR represents a step towards language models that can learn to reason in a general and scalable way. By training on the rich spectrum of reasoning tasks implicit in diverse web text, rather than narrowly specializing for particular datasets, Quiet-STaR points the way to more robust and adaptable language models. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach, with Quiet-STaR improving downstream reasoning performance while generating qualitatively meaningful rationales. We believe this also opens many potential future directions - for example, one may aim to ensemble thoughts in order to further improve the predictions for future tokens. Moreover, if the language model can predict when thought will be useful, for example by putting the mixing head before the prediction, then the predicted mixing weight could be used to dynamically allocate compute during generation. Future work can build on these insights to further close the gap between language model and human-like reasoning capabilities. Optimization and Evaluation For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a warmup of 20 steps, a learning rate of . Additionally, to avoid generating continuations for all of the tokens (for example, if one wanted to apply a value function to determine where thoughts would be most useful), one can index into this generated attention mask. Notably, however, this also requires manipulation of the other inputs during the forward pass such as the positional embeddings. Appendix CCompute-Adjusted Plots (a) GSM8K Refer to caption Refer to caption (a) GSM8K (b) CommonsenseQA Figure 7:Compute-Normalized Generalization Results. We visualize the performance curves normalized by the number of inference calls used. We also visualize Figure 2 where we normalize by the number of thought and talk tokens used for training. Appendix DMeasuring the Impact of Multiple Thoughts Per Sequence and Multiple Tokens Ahead We perform a simple ablation on our 12-thought-token-4-ahead baseline, namely asking whether sampling multiple thoughts per sequence is necessary. We find that although simply computing the reward as the difference between the losses with and without thought proves to be a strong baseline, using multiple thoughts consistently outperformed it (by roughly 0.5% on GSM8K generalization and 3% on CommonsenseQA generalization). However, the exact number of thoughts had little impact: varying between 2, 3, and 4 thoughts per sequence appeared to result in a consistent improvement with additional thoughts, but additional thoughts per sequence beyond two improved performance by only 0.1-0.3% on both GSM8K and CommonsenseQA. Similarly, we found that predicting more than one token ahead helped by 0.3% on GSM8K and 3.1% on CommonsenseQA, but with 12-thought-tokens, we did not find that additional tokens ahead, beyond two, improved performance. However, qualitatively, we found that the rationales appeared more coherent with additional tokens-ahead of supervision. This suggests a need for more specific evaluations of generation quality in future work. Appendix ERationale-Augmented Rationales Because the language model can insert thoughts anywhere, we perform a preliminary study where we investigate the reasoning generated by the language model when it has access to internal rationales while it generates external rationales (i.e. chains-of-thought) to solve a problem. Because these chains of thought are themselves generated by chains of thought, one might refer to this as a net-of-thought (or NoT). We compare five solutions from the model to a fixed random question in GSM8K, looking at outputs of the base Mistral 7B, the outputs of Mistral fine-tuned for the same number of steps on OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), and the rationales of our best Quiet-STaR model. We sample from all of them directly, at temperature � = 1 . E.1Base Mistral 7B First Response: A: Let’s think step by step. How many fresh eggs remains after the three her eat for breakfast and four goes into the muffin mix for her friends. We can calculate it by 16-3-4. The amount equals 9 fresh eggs. So, the dollars it makes daily equals what multiplied by 2. 12 x 2. The answer is 24. Second Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. She eats 3 daily for breakfast. She bakes 4 daily into muffins for her friends. That leaves 9. She sells 9 for (2), so (9times 2=18). So Janet makes 18 selling duck eggs each day. 66. Janet sells an average of 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. If she sells them for 2 per egg how much does she make per week, assuming she sells at the farmers’ market most every day?A: If Janet sells on average 12 fresh duck eggs daily on the farmers’ market. This is equal to (12times 7), so 12 (times) 7 =(84). The total amount she would then make would be (84times 2) dollars, or 168 per week. So Janet makes 168 selling duck eggs per week. Third Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How many eggs does she have left every day? This is important because it will help us find how many eggs she sells each day. What can we do to answer the question? If we write the relationship between how many duck eggs Janet has left, how many she eats, and how many she bakes for the muffins, then we can see how many eggs she has left to sell at the farmers’ market. Let’s write an equation to solve our dilemma. Subtract an equation for eggs eaten and an equation for eggs baked to find the eggs remaining. Let’s see what we can find. We can see that Janet has 6 eggs leftover each day. 6times2 = 12 per day. Therefore Janet receives an additional 12 per day for her eggs at the farmer’s market. Remember, this is just for one day, so now she makes 12 per day in additional income, because she sells her eggs at the farmer’s market each day. Answer 12 Fourth Response: Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. First, you want to find out the number of eggs a total that Janet collects each day. Take this many dollars a three and subtract from the money she gets per egg, which is 2. The answer to that question is 5. Fifth Response Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. For the first step, let’s think of the day as a whole, using some variables to keep track of the numbers of eggs. Let n = the number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day. Then the number of eggs that she eats per day will be (3) = . Next, she makes m = muffins. For each muffin, she uses 4 = eggs, so we can take from the eggs Janet’s ducks lay to represent the number she uses: 4(m)=. Now, to get her back to our starting number of eggs, we need to add these eggs back on, giving us . The eggs Janet sells each day brings her 2(n) = . This brings us to our next step. Now we will break down all the eggs from our starting number, n =, into the pieces that we set up previously. For the beginning number, we have: This brings us back to our starting number, and we can simplify this expression. Moving from the top line to the second line, we multiply the numbers within each parenthetical group. Moving from the second line to the third line, we add the products together to find the total. Finally, we can distribute and determine the final product: = 360. So the total number of eggs that Janet’s ducks lay per day is 360. Since Janet sells each egg she has for 2, her total earnings at the farmers’ market is: boxed{ 720}. E.2OpenWebMath-Trained Mistral 7B First Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. How much does she make every day? Well per the question, that is 2 per a duck egg. Now, how many duck eggs per day does she sell? Well, that’s 16 minus the eggs she eats minus the eggs she uses to ma ke muffins. She eats 3 eggs every morning, so 16-3 = 13. She makes 4 muffins, which uses 4 eggs. 16-3-4= 5. Therefore, the number of duck eggs she is selling is 5. Clearly, 1 duck egg costs 2. Therefore, the total amount she makes selling the eggs is 10 2. Now, this can be written as a fraction as, \\"ten two-dollars,\\" so 10 2 - bucks. Converting to a fraction, or \\"a tenth of ten,\\" so 10 2 - bucks = 1 10 - bucks [reveal-answer q=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"]Show Solution[/reveal-answer] [hidden-answer a=\\"fs-id1165135856725\\"] Second Response: <s> Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’ market daily for 2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers’ market? A: Let’s think step by step. On what basis can we answer the question affer considering the question? What do we know given and how can we use what we’re given to arrive at an answer. 3 is given, 4 is given, 16 is given, does anyone have any thoughts? A: Well 16 minus 3 minus 4 equals 9, and then I subtract 1 from 9 and that is 4 extra so five more eggs. M: And we know that 2 times 5 is how much? A: Ten M: Yes. A: If she eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast, in the morning equals (3 times 2 = 6). If she eat 4 duck eggs baking muffin for her friends equals (4 times 2 = 8), so total of money and that she got is 6 plus 8 which equals 14. The weight gain is 5 because it is 5 is that what you put up there so 5 times 2 ducks and subtract that from that from 16 and you got 7 no what did we write down? Are you able to figure out now what the question is, and what is what the question really is. You got 14 the weight loss you, you subtracted that from 16 which equals 2, 14 minus 2, remainder is what? A: 12. M: The question is what is Janet´s ducks lay 16 eggs, she eats 12 for sale. You subtract 3 plus 4 minus 5 so 5 when you eat the muffin equals 5, times two, the 12, minus the money so 5 times 2, -12. So (2 times 9 = 18) minus 10, so 4 more eggs... Still times 2, total comes to to 20. A: I understand there is the ones day one 3 plus 4 eats who makes and so on and so on. M: But maybe in order to answer it correctly you have to look a little close. Typically in the procedures you have that they give you first, I can tell you how here we go. M: Now if you increase the 16, now you have that you would need to determine 16 minus 3 minus 4 and that adds up to the remainder, which is 9. Then subtract 1 and but you have 5. The next answer then, which you do is now 5 times 2, which is 10. M: Which is 10, and then 14, which is is the remainder M: Is 6 and 8 and that is a total of 14, and now that you subtract 2, and that means that you now have 16 minus 5, which is 11. M: The next thing is to the yield for the second situation you have got 16 minus 3 plus 4 and that comes to 9. This is very easy to do instantaneously even the first part, 16, 3, 4 and 9, and you happen to know what lives, and you just count and you have five and five then go ahead. 5 times 2 comes to 10, so 10 then so actually you have just added 4.5, now your total is 16 plus 2. But now to this is 10 plus 2 is 12, so how much you sell from 16 and then minus 12 comes to 4. M: So what is the remainder of 16 minus 3 plus 4 minus 5? Matters you see three is missing. Four you have. Five eggs. So 5 times 2, so 10 remains at 10, so reduce, so what happens now to what happened was added with subtracted the next the question is 16 minuses 3 plus 4, and presumably you’ve done this before, if not then you add up 16 minus 3 plus 4 gives us 9 and what is the remainder after 5? So what is 5 times 2? So 10. 2, 3, plus 2 = 5 , and so your answer so far is 16 minus 3 plus 4, and give us the basket minus 2 remains 9 and now you have to determine now what is the total for the second part?

The \\"how much in dollars\\" part means that one egg is worth one dollar. So, twelve ducks lay 16 eggs, which means that Janet nets 20 from selling them. 16 muffins will give us 4 eggs, which nets us 8. So, we paid 108 for our ingredients to make 16 muffins. Hence, we lost 96 dollars. Hello, heroine, we have to do better than that! Look into averages. Let’s say that we pay 5 dollars for one egg. Now, 12 is our product and 5 is our investment.

So there are 16 eggs Monday, 16 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 16 Friday, and so on. Second, Janet eats 3 of the 16 eggs that the ducklay ap day for breakfast. She only eats the duck eggs, not her baked goods (muffins) or other food. Therefore, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, and so on. Third, she only bakes the first 4 non-eaten eggs into muffins. Therefore she sells the remaining 12 non-eaten eggs Monday, 12 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, and so on. Fourth, Janet sells duck eggs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at the 2 each. Third, she eats 3 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, Friday at the farmers’ market.

A: 18 Appendix FAdditional Works on Learning to Reason For completeness, we highlight that many other works have explored teaching language models to reason (often with algorithms similar to or inspired by STaR), either from their own rationales, from interaction with an environment, or from a hand-constructed dataset. For example, works explore this in the context of multihop question answering (Zhao et al., 2023), math (Luo et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022), machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2023). Several works investigate teaching language model agents to reason in planning (Chen et al., 2023; Gandhi et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024), or to use specific tools or memory (Yao et al., 2022; Lanchantin et al., 2024; Schick et al., 2024), while others investigate how one may distill the reasoning from a large language model into a smaller language model Ho et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Hsieh et al. (2023). Notably however, Pan et al. (2024) demonstrates that these feedback loops may result in reward hacking. Zelikman et al. (2023b) shows how a bootstrapping loop can be implemented where a model repeatedly improves a code-improver using the same code-improver and Haluptzok et al. (2023) shows how language models can bootstrap their programming ability with programming puzzles Schuster et al. (2021). Other works have employed a similar strategy for using language models to solve inductive reasoning tasks or to model real-world systems (Wang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some works have investigated how models can learn from their reasoning mistakes in-context (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Many studies have also focused on the ability of LMs to learn from in-context reasoning examples (Lampinen et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) – correspondingly, Khattab et al. (2022) and Khattab et al. (2023) show how the sets of examples used to prompt a model to reason can be optimized in the context of a multi-step reasoning pipeline. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated that one can improve zero-shot question-answering in language models by using a variety of zero-shot prompts for reasoning.","completion":"This research paper introduces Quiet-STaR, a novel approach toward enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Language Models (LMs) by teaching them to generate internal rationales or \\"thoughts\\" as an intermediary step in making predictions. The paper, authored by Eric Zelikman et al. from Stanford University and Notbad AI Inc, posits that reasoning is an implicit component in all text and that LMs can leverage this by learning to infer unstated rationales across a wide array of texts, moving beyond the confines of structured question-answering (QA) datasets featured in prior works. The Quiet-STaR methodology is based on generating rationales after every token to explain future text, subsequently mixing future-text predictions with and without rationales, and employing REINFORCE to iteratively refine the generation of useful rationales. This approach is an extrapolation of the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), extending its application from fixed tasks to reasoning within arbitrary text, thus harnessing the vast and diverse dataset of internet text to train LMs to reason more extensively. One of the notable innovations includes the development of a parallel sampling algorithm for efficient rationale generation and the introduction of meta-tokens to delineate the beginning and end of a rationale, addressing significant computational and learning challenges. The paper claims commendable zero-shot improvements on reasoning-focused tasks like GSM8K and CommonsenseQA without task-specific fine-tuning, underpinning the potential of Quiet-STaR in elevating LM reasoning abilities. Furthermore, the paper explores interesting dimensions of how rationales are generated, utilized, and the effects they have on LM predictions, providing both quantitative outcomes and qualitative insights. It delves into algorithmic specifics like the parallel generation technique for scalability, the introduction of mixing heads for gradual learning transition, and non-myopic scoring for a broader prediction horizon. The authors conclude that Quiet-STaR paves the way for LMs to learn reasoning more generally and scalably by drawing from the multidimensional landscape of reasoning tasks present in natural language, indicating a promising direction toward developing LMs with more robust and adaptable reasoning capabilities. This lays a foundational step towards realizing LMs that closely emulate human-like reasoning processes, suggesting avenues for future research in optimized compute allocation for rationale generation and the potential integrations with in-context prompting methodologies like chain-of-thought for enhanced reasoning coherence."},{"prompt":"descrivimi una città medievale del 1000 dopo cristo","completion":"Nel 1000 dopo Cristo, il tessuto urbano delle città medievali era marcatamente diverso dalle moderne conurbazioni. La città medievale tipica aveva caratteristiche architettoniche e sociali ben distinte, in larga misura influenzate dalla necessità di difesa, dall'economia basata sull'agricoltura e dall'importanza della religione nella vita quotidiana. Al centro della città si trovava spesso il castello o la fortezza, sede del signore locale o del monarca, elemento centrale del potere politico e militare. Intorno, sorgeva la cattedrale o la principale chiesa parrocchiale, simbolo dell'autorità religiosa e fulcro della vita comunitaria. Questi due punti chiave erano circondati da strade strette e tortuose, che si dipanavano in modo apparentemente caotico. Le mura cittadine erano una caratteristica comune, fornendo protezione contro le incursioni esterne. Queste erano dotate di torri di guardia e porte che permettevano l'accesso controllato alla città. L'area all'interno delle mura era limitata, il che portava a una densa costruzione con case che si affacciavano le une sulle altre su strade strette. Le abitazioni erano prevalentemente costruite in legno e paglia, anche se nelle regioni più ricche si potevano trovare costruzioni in pietra. Gli spazi commerciali erano concentrati nei mercati all'aperto o lungo le strade principali, dove artigiani, mercanti e venditori offrivano i loro beni e servizi. Era comune la presenza di gilde, associazioni di artigiani e commercianti che regolavano la produzione e il commercio di determinate merci, proteggendo gli interessi dei suoi membri. La vita nelle città medievali era fortemente influenzata dall'agricoltura, con grandi aree di terra coltivata circostanti. Le strade principali portavano alla campagna circostante, facilitando il commercio e il movimento delle persone. I servizi igienici erano molto rudimentali e le condizioni sanitarie precarie. L'acqua potabile proveniva solitamente da pozzi pubblici o fiumi, e non era raro per le malattie diffondersi rapidamente attraverso le aree densamente popolate. A livello sociale, la popolazione era stratificata in classi ben definite: l'aristocrazia e l'alta chiesa detenevano il potere e le ricchezze, mentre artigiani, mercanti e contadini formavano la maggioranza della popolazione. I servi e gli schiavi erano presenti, sebbene il loro status variasse in base alle leggi e alle usanze locali. In conclusione, le città medievali del 1000 d.C. erano centri di potere politico, economico e religioso, caratterizzate da una marcata strutturazione sociale e una densità abitativa che rendeva la vita cittadina vibrante ma anche impegnativa."}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],G={key:0},N={key:1};function z(n,e,l,c,i,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
