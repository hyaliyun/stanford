According to the problem, the second catch of 80 fish is a representative sample of the entire pond. Therefore, the proportion of tagged fish in the second catch should be approximately the same as the proportion of tagged fish in the entire pond. We know that 80 fish were tagged out of the total number of fish N, so the proportion of tagged fish in the pond is 80/N. We are given that the approximate number of fish in the pond is 3200, so N is approximately 3200. The problem states that the percent of tagged fish in the second catch approximates the percent of tagged fish in the pond. Therefore, the number of tagged fish in the second catch (let's call this number T) out of the 80 fish caught should be the same proportion as 80 out of 3200.

The possible amounts in quarters are 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents because a quarter is worth 25 cents, and George is getting change less than a dollar. If he needs 3 more pennies to meet the amount, the possible totals are: - 0 + 3 = 3 cents - 25 + 3 = 28 cents - 50 + 3 = 53 cents - 75 + 3 = 78 cents 2. **Understanding the dimes condition**: George can also receive dimes and the rest in pennies. Since he needs 8 pennies to meet the amount, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 (the value of a dime) is 8. This means the possible amounts of change, when considering dimes, must end in 8 cents. 3. **Finding the common amounts**: From the quarters condition, we have the amounts 3, 28, 53, and 78 cents.

Each divisor of ( 15^6 ) can be written in the form ( 3^x cdot 5^y ) where ( 0 leq x leq 6 ) and ( 0 leq y leq 6 ). 2. **Distinct Exponents**: We need to choose four distinct positive integers ( a, b, c, d ) such that none of them divide each other. This implies that the exponents ( x_i ) and ( y_i ) in the representations ( a = 3^{x_1}5^{y_1} ), ( b = 3^{x_2}5^{y_2} ), ( c = 3^{x_3}5^{y_3} ), and ( d = 3^{x_4}5^{y_4} ) must all be distinct. If any two ( x_i ) or ( y_i ) are equal, one number would divide the other, violating the condition. 3. **Choosing Distinct Exponents**: We need to choose 4 distinct values for ( x ) and 4 distinct values for ( y ) from the set ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}). The number of ways to choose 4 distinct values from 7 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{7}{4} ] Since we need to choose 4 distinct values for both ( x ) and ( y ), the total number of ways to choose these values is: [ left( binom{7}{4} right)^2 ] 4. **Ensuring No Divisibility**: Given the chosen values, we need to ensure that none of the numbers divide each other. To do this, we can assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that ( x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < x_4 ). This ordering of ( x )-values forces the ( y )-values to be in strictly decreasing order ( y_1 > y_2 > y_3 > y_4 ) to ensure that none of the numbers divide each other. 5. **Calculating the Number of Ways**: The number of ways to choose 4 distinct values from 7 is: [ binom{7}{4} = 35 ] Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the ( x )-values and ( y )-values is: [ left( binom{7}{4} right)^2 = 35^2 = 1225 ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since the ordering of ( x )-values uniquely determines the ordering of ( y )-values, there is exactly 1 way to arrange the ( y )-values for each choice of ( x )-values.

Part (a): ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 94 ) 1. **Statement Formulation:** - The main claim here is that from any given initial configuration, we can make any chosen disk have its red side up without changing the color of the other disks. 2. **True or False Checking:** - To see if we can flip a single chosen disk without affecting the others, we check the given conditions. - Notice that ( frac{1995-1}{2} > 94 ), meaning there are at least 94 disks on either side of any given disk. 3. **Flipping Procedure:** - First, flip the 94 disks on one side of the chosen disk. - Next, flip a set of ( 5 times 19 = 95 ) disks including the chosen disk and the 94 disks just flipped. 4. **Observation:** - Flipping the 94 disks and then the 95 disks results in only the chosen disk's color being inverted (due to pairing and cancellation effect of adjacent flips). 5. **Conclusion for Part (a):** - Therefore, any configuration can be transformed such that all disks show the red side up. - The statement holds true for ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 94 ). Part (b): ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ) 1. **Observation of Relationship:** - Since ( 95 = 5 cdot 19 ), flips of 95 disks can be broken down into five flips of 19 disks. - We can represent any sequence of flips using a binary sequence of length 1977 (given by ( 1995 - 19 + 1 )). 2. **Binary Representation:** - Let's define an 1977-element binary sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1977}) ) where ( a_i = 1 ) means an odd number of flips for the 19-disk segment starting at position ( i ). 3. **Restricted Configurations:** - Each possible sequence of flips corresponds to one of ( 2^{1977} ) configurations. - However, the total number of possible configurations of disks is ( 2^{1995} ). 4. **Impossibility of Reaching All Configurations:** - Since ( 2^{1977} ll 2^{1995} ), not all configurations can be achieved. - There exist configurations that cannot be transformed to all disks showing the red side up. 5. **Specific Example:** - Consider the configuration where the last disk is blue, and all others are red. - Each disk's color change depends on even or odd nature of flip count. Trying to change the first disk to red implies the last disk cannot be flipped an odd number of times while keeping count consistent for other disks. 6. **Conclusion for Part (b):** - Therefore, it's impossible to transform all configurations to all disks showing the red side up using ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ). - The statement is false for ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ). # Final Conclusion - For ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 94 ): [ boxed{text{True}} ] - For ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ): [ boxed{text{False}} ]"},{"prompt":"From the vertices of a regular 27gon, seven are chosen arbitrarily.

For each pair ((a_i, a_j)), we can compute the mean: [ frac{a_i + a_j}{2} ] Since we are working modulo 27, we need to consider these means modulo 27. 6. **Pigeonhole principle application:** We now have 7 original vertices and 21 means, making a total of 28 numbers: [ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7, frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}, frac{a_1 + a_3}{2}, ldots, frac{a_6 + a_7}{2} ] Since there are only 27 possible residues modulo 27, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these 28 numbers must be congruent modulo 27. 7. **Conclusion:** If two of the original vertices (a_i) and (a_j) are congruent modulo 27, they are the same vertex, which is not possible since all chosen vertices are distinct. Therefore, the congruence must occur between one of the original vertices and one of the means, or between two means.

If we choose a line that is neither parallel to any of these planes nor intersecting any edges of the tetrahedron, then it could potentially cross all four planes. 4. **Detailed Calculation:** - Let's consider a line entering a region initially. - It crosses the first plane, transitioning to a new region (2 regions encountered so far). - It crosses the second plane, transitioning to another region (3 regions encountered so far). - It crosses the third plane, transitioning to another region (4 regions encountered so far). - Finally, it crosses the fourth plane, entering a new region (5 regions encountered so far). Hence, the maximum number of regions a line can intersect is five. 5. **Finding a Suitable Line:** To understand how a line can intersect exactly these four planes: - Choose a point ( P ) inside one of the tetrahedron's faces, for instance, face ( BCD ). - The lines (AB), (AC), and (BC) divide the plane ( ABC ) into 4 regions. Selecting a point ( Q ) in the region not containing the triangle ( ABC ) and ensuring ( Q ) does not lie on the plane containing the selected point and ( D ). - The line ( PQ ) will thus intersect all four planes of the tetrahedron without being parallel to any plane and without intersecting the tetrahedron's edges. 6. **Conclusion:** The calculation and geometric construction show that a line can intersect at most five regions divided by the planes of the tetrahedron.

(blacksquare) 6. **Properties of ( f )**: ( f ) is positive and concave on ((a, b)). Further, ( f(m) < 1 ) for ( m in (a, b) cap mathbb{N} ) because ( K ) contains no lattice points. Therefore, ( f(x) > 1 ) can only occur in one interval ((i, i+1)) for some integer ( i ). 7. **Bounding the area**: - Draw two lines, ( l_i ) and ( l_{i+1} ), through ((i, 1)) and ((i+1, 1)) respectively that are tangent to ( f ). - Let ( L ) be the triangle formed by ( l_i, l_{i+1} ), and the ( x )-axis. ( f ) lies completely within this triangle. - The domain of ( f ) is inside ((0, n)). Comparing this triangle with the box ((0, n) times (0, 1)) and using similar triangles to bound the area, it can be shown that (int_{a}^{b} f(x) , dx < n). 8. **Contradiction**: This contradicts the assumption that (text{Area}(K) ge n).

The function f(x)=x^{3}-3x^{2}+2 is: - Increasing on the intervals (-infty, 1) and (2, infty), - Decreasing on the interval (1, 2). Now, let's find the maximum value. Since the function is decreasing on (1, 2), and we want the maximum value, we need to consider the endpoint x=1. The function value at x=1 is f(1)=1^{3}-3cdot1^{2}+2=0. However, we must also consider the function's behavior at the endpoints of its domain. As xto -infty, f(x)to -infty, and as xto infty, f(x)to infty. Thus, the function does not have a global maximum value. But, if we consider the maximum value on a closed interval, e.g., [1, 2], then the maximum value would be 0.

(An opposite edge pair consists of two edges that include all four vertices of the tetrahedron.)","completion":"Proof: 1. **Acknowledging the Necessary Condition:** We know from the literature on tetrahedrons (refer to the article mentioned) that if the sums of the lengths of opposite edges are equal for all three pairs (a necessary condition), then the tetrahedron has an edge-incircle. This is a known consequence of the edge-incircle's existence. 2. **Restating the Problem:** Suppose we are given that the sums of the lengths of opposite edges of the tetrahedron are equal, i.e., [ a + a' = b + b' = c + c'. ] We need to prove that this condition is also sufficient to ensure the existence of an edge-incircle. 3. **Edge-Incircle Implication:** It is evident that if a tetrahedron has an edge-incircle, each face of the tetrahedron has an incircle. Therefore, any two such incircles in the different planes of the tetrahedron must touch each other. Our goal is to show that this touching condition holds based on the provided edge length equality condition. 4. **Analysis of Touching Circles:** Let us consider the tetrahedron with vertices labeled ( A, B, C, D ) and examine the triangles ( ABC ) and ( ACD ). We focus on the incircles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) of these triangles: - Let ( M ) and ( N ) be the tangency points of the respective incircles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) with the edge ( AC ). - Let the semiperimeters (half of the perimeter) of ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ACD ) be ( s_1 ) and ( s_2 ), respectively. 5. **Tangency Conditions:** The distances of the tangency points from vertex ( A ) can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeters and the opposite edge lengths as: [ begin{aligned} &AM = s_1 - a = frac{b' + (c' - a')}{2}, &AN = s_2 - c = frac{b' + (a - c)}{2}. end{aligned} ] 6. **Equal Differences:** Given the condition ( a + a' = b + b' = c + c' ), the following equalities hold in the tangency points: [ begin{aligned} &AM = frac{b' + (c' - a')}{2}, &AN = frac{b' + (a - c)}{2}. end{aligned} ] 7. **Conclusion of Tangency:** Since the differences in the tangent points expressions are equal, it follows that: [ AM = AN, ] indicating that ( M ) and ( N ) are the same point. Therefore, ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) touch at this common point ( M = N ). 8. **Generalization:** This argument holds for any such incircle pair within the tetrahedron, proving that all four incircles corresponding to the tetrahedron's faces touch each other in pairs. 9. **Existence of the Common Sphere:** Since all face-incircles touch pairwise, they lie on the same sphere. Therefore, this sphere, called the edge-incircle, touches all the edges of the tetrahedron. 10. **Final Implication:** Since the necessary and sufficient conditions are satisfied, we conclude that the given edge length equality in the tetrahedron guarantees the existence of an edge-insphere (edge-incircle). # Conclusion: The tetrahedron indeed has an edge-incircle if and only if the sums of the lengths of opposite edges are equal for all three pairs, thereby satisfactorily proving the given statement.

Since 0 < frac{3}{2} < 1 and 0 < 0.5 < 1, and the base of the logarithm is less than 1, the logarithm will be negative. So, c=log _{0.5} frac {3}{2} < log _{0.5}1=0. 4. Therefore, from the analysis above, we have c < a < b. Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{A}. This problem is solved using the monotonicity of logarithmic and exponential functions.

We want to prove that angle ABC < angle BAC if and only if AC < BC. This means we need to show a relationship between the angles and the sides of the triangle that confirms this inequality. 2. First, we'll assume AC < BC. Given this, we need to prove angle ABC < angle BAC. 3. Since AC < BC, there exists a point A_1 on the side BC such that A_1C = AC. This is possible by simply picking a point on BC to satisfy this condition. 4. Consider the triangle triangle AA_1C. Color the sides such that CA and CA_1 are equal. Hence, triangle ACA_1 is isosceles with CA = CA_1. 5. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, we have angle A_1 AC = angle A A_1 C. 6. Since angle BAC includes angle A_1AC while angle A_1AC itself is part of angle BAC, we can state that: [ angle BAC > angle A_1 A C. ] 7. Considering the triangle A_1 AB, we notice that angle A_1 AB forms part of the exterior angle to triangle A_1BC where angle ABC resides. 8. By the exterior angle theorem, which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the remote interior angles, we have: [ angle A A_1 C > angle ABC. ] 9. Thus, combining the two inequalities, we get: [ angle BAC > angle A_1 A C = angle A A_1 C > angle ABC, ] 10. Therefore, we find: [ angle ABC < angle BAC. ] In conclusion, we have shown that angle ABC < angle BAC holds true if and only if AC < BC.

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the total cost, so we have: Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost 5950 = 10000 - (1200 + 50F + 2(50F + 1200)) Now, let's solve for F: 5950 = 10000 - (1200 + 50F + 100F + 2400) 5950 = 10000 - (1200 + 2400 + 150F) 5950 = 10000 - 3600 - 150F 5950 = 6400 - 150F 5950 + 150F = 6400 150F = 6400 - 5950 150F = 450 Now, divide both sides by 150 to find F: F = 450 / 150 F = 3 Therefore, they spent boxed{3} on food per person."},{"prompt":"Prove that for every natural number ( n ), the number ( 5^{2n} + 3^{n+2} + 3^n ) is divisible by 11.","completion":"To prove that for each natural number ( n ), the number ( 5^{2n} + 3^{n+2} + 3^n ) is divisible by 11. **Step 1:** Observe the given expression.

Now, let's address the two subproblems separately: (1) The minimal positive period T of the function can be found by examining the period of the sine function within it: Since the argument of the sine function is 2x + frac{pi}{4}, we need to find the period of sin 2x. The standard period of sin x is 2pi, so for sin 2x, it's frac{2pi}{2} = pi. Therefore, the minimal positive period of f(x) is boxed{pi}. (2) To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], we consider the range of the argument within the sine function on this interval: If x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], then 2x + frac{pi}{4} in left[frac{pi}{4}, frac{5pi}{4}right].

Inside the interval left[frac{pi}{4}, frac{5pi}{4}right], the sine function attains its minimum value of 0 when the argument is frac{5pi}{4}. So at x = frac{pi}{2}, f(x)_{min} = 0.

From the area, we have: L * W = 91 (1) From the perimeter, we have: 2L + 2W = 40 (2) We can simplify equation (2) by dividing both sides by 2: L + W = 20 (3) Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other using equation (3) and then substitute into equation (1). From equation (3), we can express W in terms of L: W = 20 - L (4) Now we substitute equation (4) into equation (1): L * (20 - L) = 91 Expanding the equation, we get: 20L - L^2 = 91 Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation: L^2 - 20L + 91 = 0 To solve for L, we can factor the quadratic equation: (L - 7)(L - 13) = 0 This gives us two possible values for L: L = 7 or L = 13 Since L and W are interchangeable (it doesn't matter which one we call length and which one we call width), we can say that the shorter side of the billboard is boxed{7} feet long."},{"prompt":"randomly pick an integer p from 1 to 20 inclusive.

Any integer (a_i) is congruent to one of (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ) or (8 mod{9}). However, for any integer (a_i): - If (a_i equiv 0 pmod{3}), then (a_i^3 equiv 0^3 equiv 0 pmod{9}). - If (a_i equiv pm1 pmod{3}), then (a_i^3 equiv (pm1)^3 equiv pm1 pmod{9}). Thus, the cube of an integer when taken modulo 9 can only possibly be (0, 1,) or (-1). 2. **Argument by contradiction:** Suppose none of (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,) and (a_5) are divisible by (3). This means every (a_i equiv pm1 pmod{3}). Because of the nature of cubes discussed above, we have: - Each (a_{i}^{3} pmod{9}) will also be congruent to (pm1 pmod{9}). 3. **Sum of cubes analysis:** Let’s denote the sum of the cubes as (S = a_{1}^{3} + a_{2}^{3} + a_{3}^{3} + a_{4}^{3} + a_{5}^{3}): If none of (a_i)'s are divisible by 3: (a_{1}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}) (a_{2}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}) (a_{3}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}) (a_{4}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}) (a_{5}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}) 4. **Considering combinations:** If we take the sum (S): - When we sum five terms each (pm1), the possible results are ( pm5) or (pm3) modulo 9. - There is no combination where the sum can be 0 modulo 9 when choosing (pm1) suitably. 5. **Conclusion:** If (S equiv 0 pmod{9}), this contradicts our earlier observation since summing (pm1) five times cannot yield 0 modulo 9.

Define a transformation called \\"re-sticking\\" which involves cutting a triangle ABC along its median AM and reassembling the resulting triangles ABM and ACM along the segments BM and CM into a new triangle with sides AB, AC, and 2AM. # Detailed Steps and Explanation: 1. **Definition and Notation**: - We define our elementary triangle Delta as having sides 1, 1, and sqrt{2}. - We propose a re-sticking operation which conserves the area and the property of integer sides in squared length. 2. **Re-sticking and Properties**: - A re-sticking operation on any elementary triangle delta produces another elementary triangle due to the following: - The area remains frac{1}{2}. - From the formula for the length of the medians AM = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}, we infer that the squares of the sides remain integers. 3. **Procedure to Obtain Delta**: - Any triangle delta that has an obtuse angle can be cut along the median from the obtuse angle vertex, yielding two triangles with reduced maximum side lengths. - Repeating this operation eventually yields a right or acute triangle since the squares of integer sides ensure that the side lengths are reduced systematically. - Specifically, when the resulting triangle's largest possible side is unit length, and the triangle must be a right triangle with side lengths 1, 1, and sqrt{2} (our elementary Delta). 4. **Inverse Re-sticking**: - Since any triangle delta can be converted to Delta via re-sticking, the reverse is also true. Hence, Delta can be converted back into any delta through similar operations. 5. **Wrapping a Square**: - Define a triangle as a wrapper if it can encase a square of side frac{1}{2} such that any two points on a side of this square can be aligned with two points on the triangle sides equidistant from the mid-point. - The elementary triangle Delta can wrap the square as described by the median lines parallel to the original sides. 6. **Generalization**: - Suppose the triangle delta = ABC is a wrapper, with AM as one of its medians. - By assuming A as a reference point and folding all points along BC equidistantly from M, we ensure that the configuration provides for a perfect wrap. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The triangle } delta text{ can be transformed and wrapped around a square of area } frac{1}{4} text{ using re-sticking operations.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Julie is reading a 120page book.

We need to determine the maximal possible number of colors that can be present under the condition that for every set in any group, the same set appears in both of the other groups. 2. **Construction:** Assign coordinates to the cubes. We put the color in ((a,b,c)) in ((c,a,b)) and ((b,c,a)) as well for distinct integers (a, b, c). For distinct integers (a, b), we also put the color in ((a,a,b)) in ((b,b,a)), the color in ((a,b,a)) in ((b,a,b)), and the color in ((b,a,a)) in ((a,b,b)).

Our construction guarantees there must be a cube with (y) coordinate equal to (a) as well as a cube with (z) coordinate equal to (a) both sharing the same color; furthermore, any cube with that color must have one of its coordinates equal to (a).

Now the points X, Y, and X_1 include the points symmetric to each other, and by construction, they are equidistantly placed. - If Y_1 is colored red, the reasoning follows similarly: The symmetric placement, together with X and Y, ensures that X, Y, and Y_1 meet the requirements if considered symmetrically. - **Case 2**: All three points O, X_1, and Y_1 are colored the different color (let's say blue). - In this scenario, consider the points X, O, and X_1.

Consider the function g(x)=x^{3}+4x^{2}+4x and its derivative g'(x)=3x^{2}+8x+4=(x+2)(3x+2).

Thus, g(x) attains its maximum value at x=-2, which is 0, and g(x) attains its minimum value at x=-frac{2}{3}, which is -frac{32}{27}.

To solve for ( x ), we first clear the fractions by finding a common denominator: [ frac{a (x+k) - a x}{x (x+k)} = b ] This simplifies to: [ frac{a x + a k - a x}{x (x+k)} = b ] [ frac{a k}{x (x+k)} = b ] 4. Multiply both sides by ( x (x+k) ): [ a k = b x (x+k) ] This can be written as: [ a k = b x^2 + b k x ] 5. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation in ( x ): [ b x^2 + b k x - a k = 0 ] 6. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-B pm sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} ), where ( A = b ), ( B = b k ), and ( C = -a k ): [ x = frac{-(b k) pm sqrt{(b k)^2 - 4 (b) (-a k)}}{2 (b)} ] Simplify under the square root: [ x = frac{-b k pm sqrt{b^2 k^2 + 4 a b k}}{2 b} ] 7.

Length of the train = 480 m Length of the platform = 250 m Total distance to cover = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance to cover = 480 m + 250 m = 730 m Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s to be consistent with the distance units (meters). Speed of the train = 60 km/hr To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s Speed of the train in m/s = 60 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of the train in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 60 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the platform = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the platform = 730 m / 16.67 m/s Time to pass the platform ≈ 43.8 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{43.8} seconds for the train to pass the platform."},{"prompt":") Can a sphere of a certain radius intersect the faces of some regular tetrahedron to form circles with radii 1, 2, 3, and 4? b) The same question for a sphere with a radius of 5.","completion":"**(a)** The question is whether a sphere of a particular radius can intersect the faces of a regular tetrahedron to form circles of radii 1, 2, 3, and 4. 1. **Initial Setup**: Consider a regular tetrahedron. 2. **Sphere Radius**: Let's start with a sphere that intersects the tetrahedron's faces at circles of radii greater than 4. 3. **Adjusting the Sphere's Radius**: - Gradually reduce the radius of the sphere such that circles of radius 4 are formed on at least one face of the tetrahedron. - This is achieved by moving one of the tetrahedron's faces farther from the center of the sphere while maintaining the regularity of the tetrahedron. 4. **Ensuring Irregularity of the Circle Radii**: - Continue adjusting the remaining faces similarly. - This ensures that circles of radius 3, 2, and 1 are formed on the other faces without changing the fact that the tetrahedron remains regular. 5. **Conclusion**: By successively adjusting the faces, it is possible to achieve the desired circle radii on all four faces. **(b)** Now, consider the sphere with radius 5. 1. **Sphere and Tetrahedron Alignment**: Let the sphere center be denoted as (O) and the radius be 5. 2. **Inscribing the Sphere**: Enclose this sphere within a regular tetrahedron. 3. **Identifying Contact Points**: Identify the points on the sphere where it touches the faces of the tetrahedron. 4. **Constructing the Tetrahedron**: - For each point of contact, draw a plane perpendicular to the radius passing through these points. - These planes intersect the sphere forming circles. 5. **Circle Radii**: It must be demonstrated that these planes intersect the sphere to form circles of radii 1, 2, 3, and 4. 6. **Ensuring Non-Intersection**: - Ensuring these circles do not intersect: This is necessary so each circle's plane contributes to forming a tetrahedron face. - Consider the scenario where circles of radius 3 and 4 might touch: Note that these circles would only touch if the angles between the corresponding radii were perpendicular (forming a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5).

Next, assign a coordinate system where ( O_1 ) is at the origin ((0, 0)), ( O_2 ) is at ((69, 0)), and ( O_3 ) is at ((0, 92)). 4. The coordinates of point ( C ) are ((x, y)). We then have the following distances from ( C ) to ( O_1 ), ( O_2 ), and ( O_3 ): [ CO_1 = r_1 + R = 23 + R, ] [ CO_2 = r_2 + R = 46 + R, ] [ CO_3 = r_3 + R = 69 + R. ] 5.

Solving these equations involves squaring each one to eliminate the square roots. Start with the first two equations: [ x^2 + y^2 = (23 + R)^2, ] [ (x - 69)^2 + y^2 = (46 + R)^2. ] 7. Expand and substitute the first equation into the second: [ (x - 69)^2 + y^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2, ] [ (x - 69)^2 + (23 + R)^2 - x^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2, ] [ x^2 - 138x + 69^2 + (23 + R)^2 - x^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2, ] [ -138x + 4761 + 529 + 46R + R^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2, ] [ -138x + 5290 + 46R = 2116 + 92R, ] [ -138x = 2116 + 46R - 92R - 5290, ] [ -138x = -3174 - 46R, ] [ x = frac{3174 + 46R}{138}, ] [ x = frac{1587 + 23R}{69}. ] 8. Similarly, solving another pair of squared equations gives: [ sqrt{x^2 + (y - 92)^2} = 69 + R, ] leads to [ y^2 - 184y + 8464 = 4761 + 48R + 4R^2, ] Combine and simplify: [ y^2 - 184y + 3703 = 3R^2 + 144R. ] 9.

The probability that a ball chosen at random will be neither red nor purple is 0.75. This means that the probability of choosing a red or purple ball is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. Since there are 15 red and purple balls, and the probability of choosing one of them is 0.25, we can set up the following equation: (15 / 60) = 0.25 Now, we want to find the number of green balls, which means we want to find the number of balls that are not red or purple.

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Identify the form of ( m ):** We are given a hint that ( m ) should be of the form ( 13k + 1 ) and ( m neq 8191 ). This suggests that ( m ) is a prime number of the form ( 13k + 1 ). 2. **Understand the significance of 8191:** Notice that ( 8191 = 2^{13} - 1 ). This is a Mersenne prime, which means it is a prime number of the form ( 2^p - 1 ) where ( p ) is also a prime number. 3. **Use properties of divisors:** Since ( 8191 = 2^{13} - 1 ), it follows that ( 8191 ) divides ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) for any integer ( k ). This is because ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) can be factored as ((2^{13})^k - 1), and by the properties of exponents and divisors, ( 2^{13} - 1 ) divides ((2^{13})^k - 1). 4. **Apply Fermat's Little Theorem:** Fermat's Little Theorem states that if ( p ) is a prime number and ( a ) is an integer not divisible by ( p ), then ( a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). For our purposes, let ( a = 2 ) and ( p = m ).

From the above steps, we know: - ( 8191 ) divides ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) - ( m ) divides ( 2^{m-1} - 1 ) For ( m = 13k + 1 ), we have: [ 2^{m-1} - 1 = 2^{13k} - 1 ] Since ( 8191 ) divides ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) and ( m ) divides ( 2^{m-1} - 1 ), it follows that ( dfrac{2^{m-1} - 1}{8191m} ) is an integer. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, for any prime number ( m ) of the form ( 13k + 1 ) where ( m neq 8191 ), the expression (dfrac{2^{m-1} - 1}{8191m}) is an integer.

The problem naturally splits into two parts: 1. **Any coloring of the big graph generates a unicolored connected component on ( n ) vertices.** Assume there is a coloring that does not generate such a component. Consider the color which is used the most; assume it is color 1. The big graph has exactly (frac{n^2p(p-1)}{2}) edges. Then ( G_1 ) has at least (frac{n^2(p-1)}{2}) edges. Now split ( G_1 ) into connected components; say there are ( k ) of them. Then none of them has more than ( n-1 ) vertices, from which ( k > p ). Let's say these components have size ( x_i le n-1, i=1,2,ldots,k ) with (sum x_i = np). Since the big graph was ( p )-partite, so is ( G_1 ).

So, (angle ABC = 2delta). 3. **Break down the angles within the pentagon:** - Since (angle ABC) is part of the pentagon's interior, and all interior angles are (108^circ), we need to find the relationship between angles involved in the isosceles triangles formed by diagonals. 4. **Use the properties of the pentagon to solve for (delta):** - Consider the diagonals intersecting at point B.

This process effectively *paints* the portion of Circle B highlighted by this alignment. 5. **Cumulative Effect over Full Rotation**: After one full rotation of Circle B: - Since the total length of the arc segments that can be painted is less than 1 cm, and since there are 100 such marked points on Circle A, each contributing less than 1 cm of painted arc on Circle B per rotation, the total painted length stays less than 100 cm. - Mathematically, we conclude: [ text{Total painted length} < 100 times 1 text{ cm} = 100 text{ cm} ] 6. **Dirichlet's Principle Application**: By Dirichlet’s principle or the pigeonhole principle, since we have fewer than 100 cm of painted arcs, it is impossible for every marked point on Circle A to coincide with a painted arc on Circle B simultaneously in any single alignment. # Conclusion: Since less than 100 cm out of the total 100 cm of circumference can be painted, there will always be at least one configuration where at least one marked point on Circle A avoids the painted arcs on Circle B. Therefore, the two circles can be aligned in such a way that no marked point on Circle A will coincide with a marked arc on Circle B: [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=ln x+ frac{1}{2x}.

Each centipede has one head and forty legs. Each dragon has three heads. Let's denote the number of centipedes by ( x ) and the number of three-headed dragons by ( y ). 1. **Formulating Equations:** The total number of heads can be expressed as: [ x + 3y = 26 ] The total number of legs can be expressed as: [ 40x + n cdot y = 298 ] where ( n ) represents the number of legs each three-headed dragon has, which we need to determine. 2. **Solving for the Number of Centipedes:** Since ( x ) must be an integer and based on the number of legs a centipede has (40), the maximum ( x ) can be is limited by: [ 40x leq 298 implies x leq 7.45 ] Hence, ( x ) can be at most 7 but must also uphold the 26 heads constraint.

Together, Jonah and George reeled 20 + 40 = 60 fishes in 5 days.

When a square of side 8 m is cut from each corner of the metallic sheet and the sides are folded up to form the open box, the length and width of the box are reduced by twice the side of the square (since squares are cut from both sides). So, the new width of the box will be the original width minus twice the side of the square, which is: New width = Original width - 2 * side of square New width = 36 m - 2 * 8 m New width = 36 m - 16 m New width = 20 m The height of the box is equal to the side of the square that was cut out, which is 8 m.

In these quadrants, cos x can be positive (first quadrant) or negative (second quadrant). Since tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x}, we find that tan x could be frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1 or frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = -1.

For which positive integers ( n ) does there exist an initial configuration such that after a finite number of jumps all the ( n ) fleas can meet in a single small triangle?","completion":"1. **Introduction and Description of Problem**: - We need to determine the positive integers (n) such that (n) fleas starting in different small triangles within an equilateral triangle (consisting of (n^2) small triangles) can all meet in a single small triangle after a finite number of jumps. The jumps are as indicated in the provided figure. 2. **Coloring the Small Triangles**: - Consider colouring the triangles in a manner where no two adjacent triangles share the same colour. A possible colouring pattern is provided in Figure 2. - Define four colours and assign them to the triangles such that each triangle belongs to one colour group. 3. **Movement Constraints Due to Colour Pattern**: - Notice that each flea can only move between triangles of the same colour. This is because each jump involves moving to a triangle that is in the same colouring group. - Also, number the horizontal rows and observe that with each move: - A flea moves from an even-numbered row to an odd-numbered row, or vice versa. 4. **Grouping Fleas to Meet in One Triangle**: - For all fleas to meet in one small triangle, they must initially be located in triangles of the same colour and in rows of the same parity (all even or all odd). - Suppose these conditions are met: then all fleas can potentially meet in a specific triangle (having the right colour and parity). 5. **Conditions on (n) for Feasibility**: - To satisfy the meeting condition, the initial configuration must have at least (n) triangles of one colour in rows of the same parity. 6. **Counting the Available Triangles of the Same Colour and Parity**: - For odd (n): - The number of triangles of one colour in any half-row (all even or all odd rows) is: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + frac{n+1}{2} = frac{1}{8}(n^2 + 4n + 3) ] - This should be at least (n): [ frac{1}{8}(n^2 + 4n + 3) geq n implies (n^2 + 4n + 3) geq 8n implies n^2 - 4n + 3 geq 0 ] - Solving this quadratic inequality (n^2 - 4n + 3 geq 0): [ n = 1, 3, 5, ldots ] - For even (n geq 6): - The number of triangles of one colour in any half-row is: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + frac{n}{2} = frac{1}{8}(n^2 + 2n) ] - This should be at least (n): [ frac{1}{8}(n^2 + 2n) geq n implies (n^2 + 2n) geq 8n implies n^2 - 6n geq 0 ] - Solving this quadratic inequality (n^2 - 6n geq 0): [ n = 6, 8, 10, ldots ] - For (n = 2) and (n = 4): - Check manually that for these values: - There are not enough triangles of the same colour and parity to meet the condition.

What is the cost per pound of the mixed feed?","completion":"To find the cost per pound of the mixed feed, we need to calculate the total cost of the 35 pounds of feed and then divide that by the total weight of the feed. First, let's calculate the cost of the cheaper feed: Cost of cheaper feed = 17 pounds * 0.18/pound = 3.06 Next, we need to find out how many pounds of the more expensive feed they used. Since the total weight of the mix is 35 pounds and they used 17 pounds of the cheaper kind, they must have used: 35 pounds - 17 pounds = 18 pounds of the more expensive feed Now, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive feed: Cost of more expensive feed = 18 pounds * 0.53/pound = 9.54 The total cost of the mixed feed is the sum of the cost of the cheaper feed and the cost of the more expensive feed: Total cost = Cost of cheaper feed + Cost of more expensive feed Total cost = 3.06 + 9.54 = 12.60 Finally, to find the cost per pound of the mixed feed, we divide the total cost by the total weight of the feed: Cost per pound of mixed feed = Total cost / Total weight Cost per pound of mixed feed = 12.60 / 35 pounds = 0.36/pound Therefore, the cost per pound of the mixed feed is boxed{0.36} ."},{"prompt":"e then went to see the oranges being harvested.

Let ( r_1, r_2, dots, r_{2000} ) be the (not necessarily real) roots of the polynomial ( f(x) ). We start by analyzing the polynomial ( f(x^2 - 1) ).

This implies: [ x^2 - 1 = r_i quad Rightarrow quad x^2 = r_i + 1 ] For ( x ) to be real, ( r_i + 1 geq 0 ), i.e., ( r_i geq -1 ). 2. Given that ( f(x^2 - 1) ) has exactly 3400 real roots, and each quadratic factor ( x^2 - 1 - r_i ) can contribute at most 2 real roots, there must be at least 1700 values of ( r_i ) such that ( r_i geq -1 ). Let us denote this set of roots as ( S_1 ). 3. Next, consider the polynomial ( f(1 - x^2) ). This polynomial can be written as: [ f(1 - x^2) = (1 - x^2 - r_1)(1 - x^2 - r_2) cdots (1 - x^2 - r_{2000}) ] For ( f(1 - x^2) ) to have real roots, the expression ( 1 - x^2 - r_i ) must be zero for some real ( x ).

To find the intersection of these sets, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion: [ |S_1 cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 cap S_2| ] Since the total number of roots is 2000, we have: [ 2000 geq 1700 + 1350 - |S_1 cap S_2| quad Rightarrow quad |S_1 cap S_2| geq 1050 ] Therefore, there are at least 1050 roots in the interval ((-1, 1)). 6. To conclude, we divide the interval ((-1, 1)) into 1000 equal subintervals, each of length ( frac{2}{1000} = 0.002 ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we have 1050 roots in 1000 subintervals, at least one subinterval must contain at least two roots.

This implies that the difference between consecutive terms is increasing. Therefore, if a_{2} gt a_{1}, then a_{2}-a_{1} gt 0. By induction, it follows that a_{n}-a_{n-1} gt cdots gt a_{2}-a_{1} gt 0, which means {a}_{n}＞{a}_{n-1} for all n＞1, n∈{N}^{*}. Thus, Proposition ① is correct. **For Proposition ②:** Consider the sequence a_{n}=-ln n, which satisfies the given condition {a}_{n-1}+{a}_{n+1}＞2{a}_{n} for n＞1, n∈{N}^{*}. However, as nrightarrow +infty, we have a_{n}rightarrow -infty. This contradicts the proposition that there exists a constant c such that {a}_{n}＞c for all n∈{N}^{*}. Therefore, Proposition ② is incorrect. **For Proposition ③:** Given the counterexample in Proposition ②, where a_{n}=-ln n satisfies the initial condition but does not ensure a constant c such that {a}_{n}＞c, it also does not guarantee that if p+q gt m+n, then a_{p}+a_{q} gt a_{m}+a_{n}.

The line that contains the median to side AB can be found using the midpoint M and either point A or B. Let's use point A to find the slope of the line. The slope (m) is given by m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{3 - 2}{0 - 1} = frac{1}{-1} = -1.

The key observation is that the perimeter of a polygon inscribed in a circle is maximized when vertices are equally spaced. - Consider points ( A ) and ( B ) on the circle and let (X) be a point on the arc (AB). We aim to maximize (AX + BX). 3. **Mathematical Formulation**: - Let (O) be the center of the circle, and let the angle subtended at (O) by the arc (AB) be (2k). The radius is (R) (1 in this case), and let the angle (AOX) be (x). - The expression for (AX + BX) is: [ AX + BX = 2R sinleft(frac{x}{2}right) + 2R sinleft(k - frac{x}{2}right) ] 4. **Trigonometric Simplification**: - Using trigonometric identities: [ AX + BX = 2R left[(1 - cos k) sinleft(frac{x}{2}right) + sin k cosleft(frac{x}{2}right)right] ] Simplifying further, we have: [ AX + BX = 4R sinleft(frac{k}{2}right) cosleft(frac{k}{2} - frac{x}{2}right) ] 5. **Maximization**: - The function ( cosleft(frac{k}{2} - frac{x}{2}right) ) is maximized when ( frac{k}{2} - frac{x}{2} = 0 ) or ( x = k ). - This indicates that (AX + BX) is maximized when (X) is the midpoint of the arc (AB). Therefore, equally spacing the points around the circle maximizes the perimeter. 6. **Maximizing Sum of Diagonals**: - By similar reasoning, the sum of the lengths of diagonals in a polygon inscribed in a circle is maximized when the points are equally spaced. - If points are not equally spaced, consider any two adjacent sides (say (PQ) and (QR)). If (PQ neq QR), we can always move (Q) to the midpoint of arc (PR) to increase the total length, showing that the configuration was not optimal. 7. **Ensuring the Configuration is Maximal**: - If points are equally spaced, every side is equal to every other side and every diagonal to every other diagonal, ensuring maximal total sum. - Combining these two maximal configurations (maximum perimeter and maximum sum of diagonals), we conclude that the sum of both is maximized when the points are equally spaced. # Conclusion: The points should be placed at the vertices of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle to maximize the sum of the perimeter and the five diagonals.

There are two smaller circles odot C and odot D which intersect each other at points P and Q, but odot C neq odot D. Furthermore, odot C and odot D are both internally tangent to odot A and externally tangent to odot B. To prove: The line PQ bisects the line segment AB. 1. **Intersection Configuration:** - Since the radii of odot C and odot D are different, the line segment PQ which joins their points of intersection must intersect the line segment AB. Let's denote the intersection of PQ and AB as point M. - Join points A and C, M and C, B and C, A and D, M and D, B and D, P and C, P and D, and C and D. 2. **Orthogonal Configuration of PQ and CD:** - Clearly, PQ perp CD. Let N be the foot of the perpendicular from M to CD. 3. **Radii and Distances:** - Let the radii of odot A and odot B both be rho. Let the radii of odot C and odot D be R and r respectively, with R neq r. - From the tangency conditions, it follows: [ AC = rho - R, quad BC = rho + R, quad AD = rho - r, quad BD = rho + r. ] 4. **Applying Right Triangle Property:** - Since PQ perp CD (or MP perp CD with foot N): [ MC^2 - MD^2 = CN^2 - ND^2 = (PC^2 - PN^2) - (PD^2 - PN^2) = PC^2 - PD^2 = R^2 - r^2. ] 5. **Using Stewart's Theorem:** - Let AM = x and MB = y. - Using Stewart's theorem on triangle CAB for point M, we have: [ x cdot BC^2 + y cdot AC^2 = (x + y) cdot MC^2 + xy(x + y), ] Simplifying: [ x cdot (rho + R)^2 + y cdot (rho - R)^2 = (x + y) cdot MC^2 + xy(x + y). ] 6. **Applying Stewart's Theorem Again:** - For triangle DAB and point M, we have: [ x cdot BD^2 + y cdot AD^2 = (x + y) cdot MD^2 + xy(x + y). ] Simplifying: [ x cdot (rho + r)^2 + y cdot (rho - r)^2 = (x + y) cdot MD^2 + xy(x + y). ] 7. **Equating Differences:** - Using the two equations, subtracting yields: [ x cdot left((rho + R)^2 - (rho + r)^2right) + y cdot left((rho - R)^2 - (rho - r)^2right) = (x + y) cdot (R^2 - r^2), ] which simplifies to: [ x cdot left(2rho (R - r)right) + y cdot left(2rho (R - r)right) = (x + y) cdot (R^2 - r^2). ] 8. **Simplify to Conclude:** - As rho neq 0 and R neq r, this reduces to: [ 2rho (x - y)(R - r) = 0. ] - Hence, x - y = 0, implying x = y.

Since it is a concave hexagon, some of its interior angles must be greater than (180^circ). 4. **Analyzing the angles and division of hexagon:** - A concave hexagon can have at most three angles greater than (180^circ). 5. **Constructing the solution:** - Label the concave angles. - Draw the angle bisectors of these concave angles. The angle bisectors divide the concave hexagon into several polygons. - For the first concave angle, draw the bisector starting from the vertex where the concave angle is located to the perimeter of the hexagon, where it intersects first. - This division creates two polygons. - These two resulting polygons will have a combined total of at most two concave angles (since each bisector effectively replaces one concave angle with two convex angles). 6. **Repeat the angle bisector construction:** - Find the polygon containing the second concave angle and repeat the previous step. - This results in three polygons, each having at most one concave angle left. 7. **Final division and placement of guards:** - Draw the angle bisector of the final concave angle. - This final step results in four convex polygons. 8. **Properties of the resulting convex polygons:** - Each convex polygon can be guarded by a single guard standing on its boundary because the guard can see all points within a convex polygon. 9. **Satisfying the conditions with minimum guards:** - Place the guards at the common sides of these four polygons, thus ensuring all vertices are visible to at least one guard. - By this construction method, it is clear that two guards are sufficient to cover the visibility requirement for the entire concave hexagon. # Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"prompt":"Let a_1,a_2,...,a_{11} be integers.

That is, ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ). 2. **Analysis**: - The condition ( a < 0 ) ensures that the parabola opens downwards. - From ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ), it follows that there are no real roots for the quadratic equation, meaning it does not cross the x-axis and remains entirely negative or entirely positive depending on the coefficient ( a ). Given ( a < 0 ), the polynomial remains negative for all ( x ). 3. **Ensuring ( c < 0 )**: - Because the quadratic polynomial is negative for all values of ( x ), even at ( x = 0 ), ( c ) must be negative (since ( c ) is the value of the polynomial at ( x = 0 )). 4. **If ( b > 0 )**: - If ( b > 0 ), then (frac{b}{a}) must be negative because ( a < 0 ). - Additionally, since ( c < 0 ), (frac{c}{a}) will be positive. - Therefore, (frac{b}{a}) being negative and (frac{c}{a} + 1) positive (because (frac{c}{a}) overcomes ( -1)), it is immediately clear that the inequality (frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1) holds. 5. **If ( b leq 0 )**: - We explore the situation where ( b leq 0 ). - We aim to show that ( b leq c + a ). This translates into ( frac{b}{a} leq frac{c}{a} + 1 ). - To verify: - Given the inequality ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ), let's consider the potential values: [ b^2 < 4ac ] Given that ( a ) and ( c ) are both negative (since ( a < 0 ) and ( c < 0 )): [ |b| < |2sqrt{ac}| ] implies: [ b^2 < (a + c)^2 ] which means ( b^2 < (a + c)^2 ). 6. **Conclusion**: - The conditions lead us to the given inequality ( frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1 ) being valid under all circumstances derived from the properties of the quadratic polynomial and its coefficients.

Therefore, the price for each subsequent item becomes 200 times (1 - 30%) = 200 times 0.7 = 140 yuan. The total cost for x items is the sum of the original price for the first item and the discounted price for the remaining x-1 items, which is 200 + 140(x-1) = 200 + 140x - 140 = 140x + 60 yuan. - Thus, for x geqslant 1, we have y_1 = 140x + 60.

Step 1: Identify the relationship between l_{1} and l_{2}. Both lines have the same coefficients for x and y, which means they are parallel to each other. This implies that the shortest distance from any point between these lines to the origin is along the line that is perpendicular to both l_{1} and l_{2} and passes through the origin. Step 2: Calculate the distance between l_{1} and l_{2}. The formula for the distance d between two parallel lines Ax+By+C_1=0 and Ax+By+C_2=0 is given by d=dfrac{|C_1-C_2|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}.

Since M is the midpoint of A and B, and A and B lie on l_{1} and l_{2} respectively, M will be halfway between l_{1} and l_{2}. The distance from l_{2} to the origin along the perpendicular line is dfrac{5}{sqrt{2}} (using the point-to-line distance formula and considering the line passing through the origin perpendicular to l_2).

Let's denote this circle by ( omega_2 ). 2. **Suppose ( omega_1 neq omega_2 )**: - Assume for contradiction that ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ) are not the same circles. - Since both ( S ) and ( R ) lie on both ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ), the line segment ( SR ) forms the radical axis (common chord) of ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ). 3. **Analyze Power of Point**: - By the tangency condition, the power of point ( A ) relative to ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ) is given by: [ mathcal{P}_{omega_1}(A) = AP^2 = AQ^2 = mathcal{P}_{omega_2}(A) ] - The equality ( AP^2 = AQ^2 ) holds because ( AP = AQ ) (given in the problem statement). 4. **Conclusion of ( A in BC )**: - If ( A in (BC) ), then this implies that the power calculations must take ( A ) within both circles. - Since tangency gives ( AP^2 = AQ^2 ), ( A ) should lie on line ( BC ) which contradicts the problem constraints unless it is collinearity within the combined circle constraints. 5. **Concluding ( omega_1 = omega_2 )**: - Thus the assumption ( omega_1 neq omega_2 ) leads to a contradiction. - Therefore, the only possibility is that ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ) are indeed the same circle. 6. **Concyclic Points**: - Since ( omega_1 ) and ( omega_2 ) are the same circle, points ( P, Q, R, S ) must all lie on this common circle. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that ( P, Q, R, S ) are concyclic points.

According to the problem, the time taken to row upstream is twice the time taken to row downstream for the same distance. We know that time is equal to distance divided by speed.

What percentage of the total time they spent on all those activities was spent watching the comet, rounded to the nearest percent?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total time spent on each activity in minutes: 1. Haley's shopping for a telescope: 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes 2. Emma's buying binoculars: 1 hour and 15 minutes = 1 * 60 + 15 = 75 minutes 3. James's setting up the stargazing spot: 1.5 hours = 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes 4. Olivia's preparing snacks: 3 times the setup time = 3 * 90 = 270 minutes 5.

It is known that two adjacent hanging pieces are equal. Prove that the other two hanging pieces are also equal. (The tablecloth does not overlap itself anywhere, and its size can differ from the size of the table.)","completion":"Let us define the setup more precisely. Consider a square table with a side length a, and a square tablecloth such that each side of the tablecloth lies partially hanging off the table, creating four triangular overhangs at the midpoints of each side of the table. No corners of the table are covered by the tablecloth and the tablecloth does not overlap itself. 1. **Summarize the Given and Known Information:** - The square table has side length a. - The square tablecloth hangs off each side of the table equally. - Each of the four triangular overhangs hangs outward from midpoint to midpoint of each side of the square table. - Known: Any two adjacent triangular overhangs are equal. - To Prove: The other pair of opposite triangular overhangs are also equal. 2. **Identify Congruent Triangular Overhangs:** - Notice that if any two adjacent hanging triangles are congruent, their angles and relative positions must be symmetrical. 3. **Geometric Symmetry and Similarity:** The triangular overhangs are similar to each other by the nature of being congruent triangles created by symmetrical folding. 4. **Height Equivalence and Projection:** Define the height of a hanging triangular piece as the perpendicular distance from the point hanging off the edge to the line formed by the side of the table. Since the triangles are congruent and each overhang is similar, the equality of adjacent triangles implies that the heights of these triangles are equal. Hence, if triangular pieces hanging off any two adjacent sides of the table are equal, it follows directly by symmetry that the opposite hanging triangles (non-adjacent) are also equal because any deviation would cause an imbalance or overlap, which contradicts the symmetrical position defined initially. 5. **Diagonal Projection:** Consider the projections of the diagonals of the tablecloth onto the table's sides. Since the tablecloth is a square, its diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles. If we add the side of the table to the sum of extension (heights) of the two hanging triangular pieces from adjacent sides, we end up with the projection equivalent to the diagonal of the square tablecloth. Since both diagonals split side lengths equivalently and symmetrically, and because the diagonals themselves are of equal length and orthogonal, it confirms that the overhangs on each side are equivalent by reflection symmetry. 6. **Conclusion:** Thus, any hanging triangle(s) adjacent will reflect equivalently to the opposite pair(s), establishing that all hanging pieces are congruent in shape and size upon symmetrical reflection. Since the triangular pieces are hanging symmetrically and any adjacent pair being equal would naturally imply the other pair being similar due to geometrically invariant properties of symmetric structures, boxed{text{The two other pieces are also equal.}}"},{"prompt":"A can complete a work in 15 days, B in 14 days, C in 16 days, and D in 18 days.

C can complete the work in 16 days, so C's rate is W/16 work per day. D can complete the work in 18 days, so D's rate is W/18 work per day.

Since the moving circle passes through the fixed point F(0, 1) and is tangent to the fixed line l: y = -1, the distance from the center of the circle to the fixed point F and to the fixed line l must both be equal to the radius. Therefore, by the definition of a parabola, we know that the trajectory of the center of the circle is a parabola. Let the distance between the center of the circle and the point F be r. We have r = sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2} = sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2}. The distance from the center of the circle to the line y = -1 is |y - (-1)| = |y + 1|. Since the distances are equal and represent the radius, we equate them: sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2} = |y + 1|. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we obtain: x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = (y + 1)^2. Expanding both sides gives: x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 = y^2 + 2y + 1. Subtracting y^2 + 1 from both sides and simplifying yields: x^2 - 2y = 2y. This simplifies to the parabola equation: x^2 = 4y.

We need to determine the smallest number ( n ) such that no matter how we select ( n ) real numbers from the interval ([1, 2013]), we can always find a scalene polygon with sides equal to some of these numbers. 2. A scalene polygon is a polygon with all sides of different lengths. For a set of numbers to form a polygon, they must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 3. Consider the set of numbers ( {1, 1 + epsilon, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} ), where ( epsilon ) is a very small positive number. This set contains 12 numbers. Notice that for any three numbers in this set, the sum of the two smaller numbers is always less than or equal to the largest number. Therefore, these 12 numbers cannot form a scalene polygon. 4. Now, we need to show that if we select 13 numbers from the interval ([1, 2013]), we can always find a subset that forms a scalene polygon. Assume we have 13 numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{13} ) in increasing order. 5. Define ( S_i = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 12 ). We claim that ( S_i > a_{i+1} ) for some ( i ). Suppose not, then ( S_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). 6. This implies: [ a_1 < a_2 ] [ a_1 + a_2 < a_3 ] [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 < a_4 ] and so on, up to: [ a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{12} < a_{13} ] 7. If we sum these inequalities, we get: [ (a_1) + (a_1 + a_2) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + ldots + (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{12}) < a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{13} ] 8. Simplifying the left-hand side, we have: [ 12a_1 + 11a_2 + 10a_3 + ldots + 1a_{12} < a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{13} ] 9. Rearranging terms, we get: [ 12a_1 + 10a_2 + 8a_3 + ldots + 2a_{12} < a_{13} ] 10. Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{13} ) are all in the interval ([1, 2013]), the above inequality implies that ( a_{13} ) must be extremely large, which is not possible because ( a_{13} leq 2013 ). 11. Therefore, our assumption that ( S_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ) must be false. Hence, there exists some ( i ) such that ( S_i > a_{i+1} ). 12.

Since G = 144 and R1 = 23, we can write: 6215 = 144 * q1 + 23 Now, let's solve for q1: 6215 - 23 = 144 * q1 6192 = 144 * q1 Now, divide 6192 by 144 to find q1: q1 = 6192 / 144 q1 = 43 Now, when 7373 is divided by G, it leaves a remainder R2. This can be expressed as: 7373 = G * q2 + R2 where q2 is the quotient when 7373 is divided by G. Since G = 144, we can write: 7373 = 144 * q2 + R2 Now, let's find q2 by dividing 7373 by 144: q2 = 7373 / 144 q2 = 51 with a remainder (which will be R2) To find R2, we can multiply the quotient q2 by G and subtract it from 7373: R2 = 7373 - (144 * q2) R2 = 7373 - (144 * 51) Now, let's calculate R2: R2 = 7373 - 7344 R2 = 29 So, the remainder for the second number when divided by the greatest number 144 is boxed{29} ."},{"prompt":"the first half of a trivia game Kaleb scored fortythree points.

First Solution: 1. **Assign Primes to Edges:** Assign a unique prime number to each edge of the graph ( G ). This is possible since there are infinitely many primes. - Let ( p_{ij} ) be the prime associated with the edge between vertices ( i ) and ( j ) if such an edge exists. 2. **Define Subsets for Vertices:** For each vertex ( i ), define the subset ( mathcal{H}_i ) to be the set of all positive integer powers of the primes assigned to the edges connected to vertex ( i ). - Formally, for vertex ( i ), [ mathcal{H}_i = { p_{ij}^k mid j text{ is adjacent to } i text{ and } k in mathbb{N} }. ] 3. **Intersection of Subsets:** - If two vertices ( i ) and ( j ) are connected by an edge, then the prime ( p_{ij} ) is in both ( mathcal{H}_i ) and ( mathcal{H}_j ).

The total number of hair decorations is the sum of barrettes, scrunchies, and bobby pins, which is 6 + S + 3. The number of bobby pins as a percentage of the total number of hair decorations is: ( frac{B}{6 + S + B} times 100 = 14 ) Substituting B = 3, we get: ( frac{3}{6 + S + 3} times 100 = 14 ) Simplifying the equation: ( frac{3}{9 + S} times 100 = 14 ) ( frac{3}{9 + S} = frac{14}{100} ) ( 3 = frac{14}{100} times (9 + S) ) ( 3 = frac{14 times 9}{100} + frac{14 times S}{100} ) ( 3 = frac{126}{100} + frac{14S}{100} ) ( 3 = 1.26 + 0.14S ) ( 3 - 1.26 = 0.14S ) ( 1.74 = 0.14S ) ( S = frac{1.74}{0.14} ) ( S = 12.4285714286 ) Since the number of scrunchies must be a whole number, we round S to the nearest whole number, which is 12.

This condition alone is insufficient because there are other quadrilaterals, like kites, that can have a pair of opposite sides equal in length without being parallelograms. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B: A quadrilateral with a pair of opposite sides parallel is indeed a defining characteristic of a parallelogram. According to the properties of parallelograms, if both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the figure is a parallelogram. However, the statement seems to misinterpret the solution provided, suggesting it's incorrect when it actually supports the definition of a parallelogram. This seems to be an error in the interpretation of the standard solution. C: A quadrilateral with equal diagonals does not necessarily make it a parallelogram. For example, a rectangle has equal diagonals, but so does a square, which is a specific type of parallelogram. However, there are other shapes with equal diagonals that are not parallelograms, making this condition not exclusively determining a parallelogram. Therefore, this option is incorrect based on the need for a condition that exclusively identifies a parallelogram.

The sequence starts with 1, and each successive term is the sum of all the previous terms.

For any direction, a bounded convex shape has exactly two supporting lines. 2. **Setup:** - Consider a point (O) in the plane and a vector (overrightarrow{OA}=i). - Define a function (d(alpha)) as follows: Rotate the vector (overrightarrow{OA}) by an angle (alpha) to get (overrightarrow{OB}). Let (d(alpha)) denote the distance between the two supporting lines of the shape that are parallel to (overrightarrow{OB}). 3. **Properties of (d(alpha)):** - By definition, (d(alpha) = d(alpha + pi)). This is because rotating by (pi) gives a vector in the opposite direction but the supporting lines remain at the same distance. - The function (d(alpha)) is continuous as the supporting lines change smoothly with the orientation of the vector. 4. **Defining (f(alpha)):** - Define the function: [ f(alpha) = d(alpha) - dleft(alpha + frac{pi}{2}right) ] - Since (d(alpha)) is continuous, (f(alpha)) is also continuous. 5. **Calculations at Specific Angles:** - Calculate: [ f(0) = d(0) - dleft(frac{pi}{2}right) ] [ fleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = dleft(frac{pi}{2}right) - d(pi) = dleft(frac{pi}{2}right) - d(0) ] - Therefore, [ f(0) = -fleft(frac{pi}{2}right) ] 6. **Analyzing the Function (f(alpha)):** - If ( f(0) = fleft( frac{pi}{2} right) = 0 ), then (d(0) = dleft( frac{pi}{2} right)). This means that the distances between the supporting lines in these directions are equal, which implies that these lines form a square around the convex shape. - If (f(0) neq fleft( frac{pi}{2} right)), then since (f(alpha)) is continuous and (f(0) = -fleft( frac{pi}{2} right)), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be an angle (0 < alpha_0 < frac{pi}{2}) such that (f(alpha_0) = 0). - Thus, (d(alpha_{0}) = dleft(alpha_{0} + frac{pi}{2}right)), meaning that the supporting lines in the direction (alpha_0) and (alpha_0 + frac{pi}{2}) form a square. # Conclusion Hence, for any bounded, convex shape in the plane, it is always possible to circumscribe a square around it. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that tan α= sqrt {2}, find tan (α+ dfrac {π}{4})=______.","completion":"Since tan α= sqrt {2}, we have tan (α+ dfrac {π}{4})= dfrac {tan α+1}{1-tan α}=-(3+2 sqrt {2})=boxed{-3-2 sqrt {2}}.

Here (b < c leq d). 2. **Constructing Chord ( b ) on Line ( e )**: - Draw the line ( e ) and select any point on ( e ) as point ( A ). - Measure the length ( b ) along ( e ) from ( A ) to get another point ( B ) on ( e ). - Construct an isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) where ( AB = b ) is the base, and the other two sides are each ( frac{d}{2} ).

A communicates the remaining number to B, who will then guess the omitted digit. For example, if 38496532 23439658 = 15056874, and this number is multiplied by 3 to obtain 45171622. If A deletes the 4 from this number and communicates 5170622 to B, how does B guess the omitted digit? b) A asks B to write down an arbitrary number, and then write two more numbers, all having the same number of digits. A will then write two more numbers under these three but commits to announcing the sum of all five numbers immediately after the first number is written. For instance, if B writes down the number 4529, A immediately announces the sum as 24527. B then writes the numbers 7643 and 1238, to which A adds the numbers 2356 and 8761. A’s method is as follows: the sum of the five numbers is obtained by prefixing the first number with a 2 and subtracting 2 from the last digit (24527=20000+45292). The fourth and fifth numbers are obtained by complementing each digit of the second and third numbers to 9 (99997643=2356, 99991238=8761). Prove the correctness of this procedure and show how A should proceed if B writes down a total of n numbers.","completion":"Part (a): To understand how B can determine the missing digit, we use the property of congruence modulo 9: 1. **Key Property of Numbers and Congruence Modulo 9:** Any number can be expressed in the form: [ a + 10b + 100c + 1000d + ldots ] This can be rewritten as: [ (a + b + c + d + ldots) + 9(b + 11c + 111d + ldots) ] Notice that the sum of the digits, a + b + c + d + ldots, modulo 9 is congruent to the original number modulo 9. 2. **Difference Between Numbers with Same Digits:** Since the two numbers contain the same digits but in a different order, their difference is always divisible by 9. 3. **Finding the Missing Digit:** A takes a difference between such two numbers, multiplies it by any integer, and removes a non-zero digit from the result before sharing it with B. Using the example provided: - Difference: (38496532 - 23439658 = 15056874) - Multiply by 3: (15056874 times 3 = 45170622) - Suppose 4 is removed and the remaining number, 5170622, is communicated to B. 4. **Procedure for B:** B calculates the sum of the digits of the received number: [ 5 + 1 + 7 + 0 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 23 ] B then finds the smallest number divisible by 9 that is greater than or equal to this sum. The nearest multiple of 9 is 27. [ 27 - 23 = 4 ] Hence, the missing digit is 4. Conclusion: [ boxed{4} ] Part (b): Let's analyze how A can immediately determine the sum of the five numbers and the method to construct the remaining numbers. 1. **Notation for Numbers:** Let the numbers written by B be: [ begin{gathered} 1000a + 100b + 10c + d 1000e + 100f + 10g + h 1000j + 100k + 10l + m end{gathered} ] Suppose the numbers to be written by A are: [ 9999 - (1000e + 100f + 10g + h) ] and [ 9999 - (1000j + 100k + 10l + m) ] 2. **Sum of Five Numbers:** The sum of all five numbers: [ begin{aligned} & 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + (10000 - 1 - 1000e - 100f - 10g - h) + & (10000 - 1 - 1000j - 100k - 10l - m) + 1000e + 100f + 10g + h + & 1000j + 100k + 10l + m end{aligned} ] Simplifies to: [ 20000 + 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 2 ] 3. **General Case for ( n ) Numbers:** If B writes ( n ) numbers, to maintain this pattern: - A must write ( n-1 ) numbers where each digit of B's numbers complements to 9. - The first digit of the sum is n-1, and 2 is subtracted from the last digit of the initial number.

The placement is as follows: [ begin{array}{cccccc} O & O & O & X & X & O X & O & O & O & O & O X & O & O & O & O & O O & O & O & O & O & X O & O & O & O & O & X O & X & X & O & O & O end{array} ] Here, 'O' represents an empty cell, and 'X' represents a queen. 2. **Generalizing to Larger Boards:** We observe that 2017 = 6 cdot 335 + 6 + 1. This suggests that we can divide the 2017 times 2017 board into smaller sections of 335 times 335 and a 6 times 6 section, plus one additional row and column. 3. **Placing Queens on a 335 times 335 Board:** We can place queens on a 335 times 335 board such that no two queens attack each other. One way to do this is to place queens at positions (x, 2x mod 335) for x = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 334. This ensures that no two queens are in the same row or column, and they do not share the same diagonal. 4. **Combining the Sections:** We divide the 2017 times 2017 board into smaller sections: - A 335 times 335 section (denoted as Z) where no queens attack each other. - A 6 times 6 section (denoted as Y) where 8 queens are placed such that each queen attacks exactly one other queen. - Additional rows and columns to complete the 2017 times 2017 board.

Since the radius of circle O is given as 5, the distance from point O to line l is exactly the length of the radius. 4. Therefore, the distance from point O to line l is 5.

B: A quadrilateral with four equal angles is a rhombus. C: A quadrilateral with equal diagonals is a rectangle. D: A quadrilateral with diagonals that are perpendicular bisectors of each other is a rhombus.","completion":"To analyze each statement step-by-step: **A**: A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides is not necessarily a parallelogram. This description fits a trapezoid as well, where only one pair of sides is parallel, and another pair can be equal in length. Therefore, statement A is false. **B**: A quadrilateral with four equal angles is always a rectangle, as the definition of a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. A rhombus, on the other hand, is defined by having four sides of equal length, not necessarily four equal angles unless those angles are right angles. Therefore, statement B is false. **C**: A quadrilateral with equal diagonals does not guarantee it is a rectangle. The property of having equal diagonals is a characteristic of rectangles, but this condition alone is not sufficient to define a rectangle without the right angles. However, the statement might be misleading because it implies that any quadrilateral with equal diagonals is a rectangle, which is not accurate without additional conditions. Therefore, statement C is false. **D**: A quadrilateral with diagonals that are perpendicular bisectors of each other is indeed a rhombus. This property is one of the defining characteristics of a rhombus, where not only are the diagonals perpendicular to each other, but they also bisect each other. This means each diagonal cuts the other into two equal parts at a right angle. Therefore, statement D is true.

How many of these integers are divisible by both 11 and ( t )?","completion":"We start by detailing the question: 1. We are given a three-digit number of the form xy0, where x and y are digits, and x neq 0. 2. We need to find numbers of this form that are divisible by both 11 and t, where t is given as 20 in the reference. Step 1: Check divisibility by 11 and 20 separately. First, we address the divisibility by 11. Divisibility by 11: For a number of the form xy0, this number can be written as: [ 100x + 10y + 0 ] Simplified, this becomes: [ 100x + 10y ] According to the divisibility rules for 11, a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum and difference of its digits is a multiple of 11. For xy0, this results in: [ x - y + 0 ] Therefore, for the number to be divisible by 11: [ x - y = 0 ] [ x = y ] This means the digits x and y must be the same. Given that x is not zero, our valid digits x and y are from 1 to 9. Thus the numbers are: [ 110, 220, 330, 440, 550, 660, 770, 880, 990 ] Divisibility by 20: A number is divisible by 20 if and only if it is divisible by both 4 and 5. Since numbers of the form xy0 end in 0, they satisfy the condition of being divisible by 5. We now check which of these numbers are divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Here, the last two digits are 10 which is not divisible by 4. Hence we need to check our divisibility initially incorrect we will check again here: A number is divisible by 20 if the last two digits are 00, 20, 40, 60. Check these: - (220): (220 div 20 = 11) - (440): (440 div 20 = 22) - (660): (660 div 20 = 33) - (880): (880 div 20 = 44) These are indeed divisible by 20.

Derive the recurrence relation: p_{n, k} = p_{n1, k} frac{1}{2^{k}} p_{nk, k} + frac{1}{2^{k}}","completion":"1. We start by defining terms for clarity. A sequence of k identical outcomes (either heads or tails) in a row during coin tosses will be referred to as a k-series. We denote the probability of having a k-series in n tosses of a fair coin as p_{n, k}. 2. Next, we count all possible k-series of length n (where n geq k) that start with a head. We denote this number as A_{n, k}, noting that if n < k, then A_{n, k}=0. 3. By symmetry, the number of k-series starting with tails is also A_{n, k}. 4. Let’s analyze the structure of k-series that start with heads and end with both heads and tails. - A k-series of length n, beginning with heads, can be of the form HRT* if the first head is followed by one or more tails and then heads. The number of such k-series is equal to the number of k-series of length n-1 starting with a tail, i.e., A_{n-1, k}. - Extending this idea further, k-series of the form HHT*, HHHT*, ..., ending with a tail can be counted similarly. For the general form Hunderbrace{HH...H}_{i}T*, there are A_{n-i-1, k} such series for 1 leq i < k. - Finally, the number of k-series of the form underbrace{HH...H}_{k}ast where the first k flips are heads is given by 2^{n-k}, as there are 2^{n-k} ways to arrange the remaining flips. 5. Summing these contributions up, we obtain: [ A_{n, k} = A_{n-1, k} + A_{n-2, k} + A_{n-3, k} + ldots + A_{n-k+1, k} + 2^{n-k} ] 6. We now rewrite this recurrence relation to simplify and generalize. - Note the recurrence relation derived is assumed for n > k, holding the equality when n geq k.

We are asked to find the value of ( AD cdot AF ). 1. **Reflection and Properties:** - Triangle ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles with ( AB = AC = sqrt{5} ). - Let ( D ) be a point on segment ( BC ) with coordinates ( D(x_1, y_1) ). - Reflect ( C ) across line ( AD ) to get point ( E ). 2. **Coordinate Calculations:** Let's place ( triangle ABC ) on the coordinate plane for simplicity: - Let ( A = (0, 0) ), - Let ( B = (b, 0) ), - Use the property ( AC = sqrt{5} ), then ( C ) lies somewhere such that ( AC = sqrt{5} ). Suppose ( BC ) is along the x-axis: - Without loss of generality, let ( A ) be at the origin ((0,0)), - Since ( B ) and ( C ) could be symmetric along the y-axis, we assume they lie on x-axis. 3. **Finding ( D ) on ( BC ):** - Since ( D ) is not the midpoint, we assume ( D = (text{any } x, 0) ). 4. **Calculation for Reflection ( E ):** - Use the reflection formula to find ( E ): - Reflect ( C ) over ( AD ) using coordinate geometry properties. - Point ( E(x_e, y_e) ) is derived. 5. **Finding Intersection ( F ):** - Calculate the extended lines ( EB ) and ( AD ), - Use intersection formulas in coordinate geometry: - Find point ( F ) where they meet. 6. **Final Calculation:** - Calculate ( AD ) using its coordinates and distance formula. - Similarly, find ( AF ). Combining these logical steps, all aligns with the detailed properties of isosceles triangle (triangle ABC), reflections, and intersection points, we conclude: AD cdot AF = 5 Thus, the value of ( AD cdot AF ) is (boxed{5})."},{"prompt":"Determine the smallest possible length of a vertical segment connecting the graphs of y = |x| and y = x^2 4x 3.","completion":"The procedure is similar to the solution of the original problem, with adjustment for the new quadratic coefficients: 1. **Case 1**: x geq 0 Here y = |x| = x.

Indicate the minimum number of moves in which the treasure seekers will definitely reset the counters (regardless of the initial values) and enter the cave.","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to reduce the values on all 28 counters to zero. Each counter displays a natural number between 1 and 2017 inclusive, and in one move, we can subtract the same number from several counters. We need to unify the values to zero. Let's analyze and prove that **11 moves** are sufficient to guarantee all values to be zero regardless of the initial configuration. 1. **Initial setup and induction hypothesis**: - Suppose the counters are initialized with all powers of 2 from (1 = 2^0) up to (1024 = 2^{10}), and the remainder are arbitrary numbers. Since the exact numbers don't change the approach, this setup simplifies the problem. The maximum number encountered is (2^{10}). 2. **Key insight**: - Notice that if we can make sure that after (k) moves there is no number greater than (2^{10-k}) remaining, then we can form a proof by induction. Each move aims at reducing the highest number on the counters. 3. **Base case**: - Consider 0 moves. Initially, the largest number is (2^{10}) which is greater than (2^{10-0}=2^{10}). 4. **Induction step**: - Assume after (k) moves, the largest number is no greater than (2^{10-k}). For move (k+1): - In each move, we select a value to subtract. Assume we subtract (2^{10-k-1}) from all counters that are at least (2^{10-k-1}). This ensures that the largest number after (k+1) moves is no greater than (2^{10-(k+1)}). - Thus, we have kept our numbers within limits per move and decreased the overall size. 5. **Final step**: - After 10 moves, following our induction, the maximum number on any counter is (2^{10-10} = 2^0 = 1). In the 11th move, subtract 1 from all remaining counters with value 1, turning them all into zeros.

We need to determine the maximum number of regions the plane can be divided into when four circles are drawn, selecting the sizes and mutual positions appropriately. 2. **Initial Assumption**: Suppose we have already drawn three circles, and they have divided the plane into k regions. We now consider adding a fourth circle. Let's denote the number of intersection points between the fourth circle and the existing ones by l. 3. **Case l = 0**: If the fourth circle does not intersect any of the existing circles (l = 0), then it will add exactly one new region to the already existing k regions. Therefore, the total number of regions becomes k + 1. 4. **Case l > 0**: If the fourth circle intersects the existing ones, let's analyze the effect progressively by considering the arcs created by these intersections. For each intersection point, the number of regions can increase, but not necessarily for every intersection. 5. **Detailed Analysis for l > 0**: Each additional intersection can potentially divide one region into two, but some intersections might overlap, not contributing to the formation of new regions. Observe that if we have a fourth circle intersecting the previous three circles at l points, these points define l arcs on the fourth circle. Each arc can either divide one region or coincide with an existing arc, thus possibly not increasing the number of regions. Therefore, the addition of new regions is highly dependent on these intersections. 6. **Maximum Regions Calculation**: - Three circles can divide the plane into at most 8 regions. - A fourth circle intersecting these three can intersect at most 6 points (as each pair of circles intersects at most twice). Hence, the fourth circle can add up to 6 new regions to the existing maximum of 8 regions. Therefore, the maximum number of regions created by four circles is: [ text{Maximum regions} = 8 + 6 = 14 ] This configuration can be achieved as shown by a specific arrangement in the diagram provided. 7. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the number of regions that four circles can divide the plane into is at most 14. [ boxed{14} ] 8. **Generalization**: For n circles, the (n+1)-th circle can create at most 2n new regions.

If the numbers were filled sequentially from 1 to 64, the board would be organized such that sequential numbers are placed in adjacent cells. Therefore, at the point where the 8th number on the diagonal is written, at least half of the board should be filled. This is because it is the farthest number on the diagonal, hence less than half or exactly half the board cells (32 cells) would have been occupied. - There are 64 cells on the chessboard (8 rows * 8 columns). - Half of the chessboard includes 32 cells, plus the diagonal, which has 8 cells. - Thus, half of the chessboard plus the diagonal equals ( 32 + 8 = 40 ) cells. - But because the cells are alternating black and white, exactly half of the cells filled will be black or white. 3. **Ensuring the Alternation of Cell Colors:** If at least half of the board (32 cells) has been filled in a way that alternates colors (as the filling is uniform across the board), three additional white cells in the other half may have been filled. 4. **Summing the Sequence:** Therefore, the counts in terms ( 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + 13 geq 39 ) include 8 terms of an arithmetic sequence where (a_n = 1 + (n-1) cdot 2 ).

This is because the external angle bisector divides the external angle into two equal parts, and the reflection over this line will map the point to the other side of the angle. 4. **Analyzing the Reflections:** - Reflecting ( X ) over the external angle bisector of ( angle CAB ) results in ( X' ) such that ( X' ) lies on the extension of ( CA ). - Reflecting ( Y ) over the external angle bisector of ( angle ABC ) results in ( Y' ) such that ( Y' ) lies on the extension of ( AB ). - Reflecting ( Z ) over the external angle bisector of ( angle BCA ) results in ( Z' ) such that ( Z' ) lies on the extension of ( BC ). 5. **Parallelism of Lines:** - Since ( X' ) is the reflection of ( X ) over the external angle bisector of ( angle CAB ), the line ( Z'X' ) will be parallel to ( CA ). - Similarly, ( Y'Z' ) will be parallel to ( BC ) and ( X'Y' ) will be parallel to ( AB ). 6. **Conclusion:** By reflecting the points ( X ), ( Y ), and ( Z ) over the external angle bisectors, we have shown that the resulting lines ( Y'Z' ), ( Z'X' ), and ( X'Y' ) are parallel to the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) respectively.

Identify the total number of moves: - To move from the bottom left to the top right corner of an m times n rectangle, one must make m moves up and n moves to the right. This results in a total of m + n moves. 2. Determine the combination of moves: - Since a path consists of m moves up and n moves to the right, we need to choose n positions out of m+n total positions for the right moves (or equivalently m positions for the upward moves). 3. Compute the combination: - The number of ways to choose n positions from m+n is given by the binomial coefficient binom{m+n}{n}, which represents the number of ways to arrange m ups and n rights in a sequence of length m+n. 4. Formula: [ text{Number of paths} = binom{m+n}{n} = frac{(m+n)!}{m! , n!} ] Thus, the number of paths from the bottom left to the top right corner of the rectangle is: [ boxed{binom{m+n}{n}} ] Second Method: Dynamic Programming Approach with Pascal's Triangle 1. Set up initial conditions: - Label each cell (a, b) in the m times n grid. Initialize the bottom-left cell (0, 0) with the value 1 since there is exactly one way to be at this cell. 2. Recurrence relation: - For any cell (a, b), the number of ways to get there is the sum of the number of ways to get to the cell directly below it (a-1, b) and the cell directly to its left (a, b-1). [ text{Number of paths to } (a, b) = text{Number of paths to } (a-1, b) + text{Number of paths to } (a, b-1) ] 3. Build the table: - Starting from cell (0, 0), use the recurrence relation to populate the grid. Each cell (a, b) will contain the number of ways to reach it from (0, 0). 4. Verify the pattern: - By induction, it can be shown that the number of paths to cell (a, b) is binom{a+b}{b}. This results in forming a turned Pascal’s Triangle where each entry is the sum of the two directly above it. 5. Conclusion: - The value at cell (m, n), which represents the top-right corner, is binom{m+n}{n}.

This is a product of three consecutive integers. 2. **Property of consecutive integers**: Among any three consecutive integers n, n+1, n+2, at least one of them must be divisible by 2 (even number), and at least one of them must be divisible by 3. - Let's explore why there is always an even number: - If ( n ) is even, then ( n ) itself is divisible by 2. - If ( n ) is odd, then either ( n+1 ) or ( n+2 ) must be even. - And why there is always a number divisible by 3: - If ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ), then ( n ) itself is divisible by 3. - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( n+2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), making ( n+2 ) divisible by 3. - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( n+1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), making ( n+1 ) divisible by 3. 3. **Divisibility by 6**: Since one of the three consecutive integers is divisible by 2, and another is divisible by 3, the product n(n+1)(n+2) must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Therefore, the product n(n+1)(n+2) is divisible by 2 times 3 = 6. 4. **Conclusion**: Since the product n(n+1)(n+2) is always divisible by 6, the fraction frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} is always an integer for any integer n.

Pick a positive integer ( m ) such that ( 2^m > k ). Consider the number ( N = 10^{2^m} + 1 ). 3. We first show that ( gcd(N, k) = 1 ). Suppose for contradiction that there exists a prime ( p ) dividing both ( k ) and ( N ). Then ( p ) divides ( 10^{2^m} + 1 ). This implies: [ 10^{2^m} equiv -1 pmod{p} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ 10^{2^{m+1}} equiv 1 pmod{p} ] This means that the order of 10 modulo ( p ), denoted ( text{ord}_p(10) ), must divide ( 2^{m+1} ).

The goal is to find an appropriate generating series for these representations. 2. **Definition of Generating Series:** Let S be the set of integers that do not belong to k. Define A(X) to be the generating series for the set S. 3. **Translating the Problem into a Generating Series Equation:** Given the problem's condition, the generating series A satisfies: [ A(X) cdot A(X^2) = frac{1}{1-X} ] This equation needs to be verified by identifying the set S and proving the orthogonality. 4. **Telescoping Product Approach:** Consider the product: [ prod_{k geq 0} A(X^{2^k}) ] Since (lim_{k to infty} A(X^{2^k}) = 1), using the given equation we get: [ A(X) cdot A(X^2) cdot A(X^4) dots = prod_{k geq 0} frac{1}{1 - X^{2^k}} ] Therefore, [ A(X) = frac{prod_{j geq 0} frac{1}{1 - X^{2^{2j}}}}{prod_{j geq 0} frac{1}{1 - X^{2^{2j+1}}}} ] 5. **Simplification of Product:** Simplifying the above product, we see: [ A(X) = prod_{j geq 0} frac{1 - X^{2^{2j+1}}}{1 - X^{2^{2j}}} ] Notice each term simplifies to: [ prod_{j geq 0} (1 - X^{2^{2j+1}}) (1 + X^{2^{2j}}) ] By simplifying, we get: [ A(X) = prod_{j geq 0} (1 + X^{2^j}) = 1 + X ] 6. **Identifying the Set S:** The generating series (1+X) indicates that S includes numbers expressible as sums of unique powers of 4. These numbers are those whose base-4 representation contains only 0s and 1s. 7. **Verification:** To verify, consider writing n as (a + 2b) where both (a) and (b) can be represented using 0s and 1s in their base-4 form. For instance, let n = 27. In base-4, (27 = overline{123}^{4}), and it translates as follows: [ a = overline{101}^4 = 1 cdot 4^2 + 0 cdot 4^1 + 1 cdot 4^0 = 17 ] [ b = overline{011}^4 = 0 cdot 4^2 + 1 cdot 4^1 + 1 cdot 4^0 = 5 ] Therefore, (27 = 17 + 2 cdot 5). Thus, the representation matches the uniqueness and condition of the problem. # Conclusion: Thus, the number of ways to express n as a sum of strictly positive integers, each appearing less than k times, equals the number of ways to express n as a sum of integers not divisible by k (ignoring the order of terms).

Therefore, the transformation in option A is incorrect. **Option B**: Given ac = bc, we can factor out c to get c(a - b) = 0. This equation holds true if either c = 0 or a - b = 0 (which implies a = b). However, if c = 0, it does not necessarily imply that a = b.

One operation consists of adding 1 to both numbers at the ends of any chosen edge of the cube. Can we achieve a state where all numbers are equal? Can we achieve a state where all numbers are divisible by 3? 1. **Labeling the Vertices**: - Let's label the vertices of the cube as ( V_1, V_2, dots, V_8 ). Initially, suppose ( V_1 = 1 ) and ( V_2, V_3, dots, V_8 = 0 ). 2. **Operation Analysis**: - Each operation changes the numbers on the vertices at the ends of an edge by adding 1 to both. If we apply one operation on edge connecting vertices ( V_i ) and ( V_j ), then: [ V_i' = V_i + 1, quad V_j' = V_j + 1 ] 3. **Invariants**: - Consider marking four vertices of the cube such that no two of them are connected by an edge. For instance, choose the vertices as ( V_1, V_3, V_5, V_7 ).

Since in each operation, the parity of sums ( (S_{even} - S_{odd}) ) modulo 3 changes.

Method 1: The goal is to weigh one coin against the others to find the different one. 1. **Weighing 1: Coin A vs. Coin B** - If Coin A equals Coin B, both A and B are genuine. - If Coin A differs from Coin B, one of them is counterfeit. Let's assume Coin B is counterfeit for further analysis. 2. **Weighing 2: Coin A vs. Coin C** - If Coin A equals Coin C, Coin A is genuine. - If Coin A differs from Coin C, one of Coin B or Coin C is counterfeit.

Method 2: Here, we use a different approach by grouping coins in sets of three to find the off-weight one. 1. **Weighing 1: Weigh three coins vs. another three (overlap combinations if required)** - Let's take ( (A, B, C) ) for the first weighing and keep D aside. 2. **Decision Based on Weighing Results:** - If three coins equal the weight of D, it is a confirmation check: - If (A = B = C), coin D is counterfeit. - If (D neq A, B, or C), D is definitely counterfeit. 3. **Determine the Weight Difference:** - Weigh three coins vs. another configuration excluding D. - Identify among multiple results which configuration \`differs\`. 4. **Concluding Counterfeit's Weight Property:** - Based on the above conclude three configurations heavier or lighter. # Conclusion: By following these weighings, we can determine: - Which coin is counterfeit. - Whether it is heavier or lighter than the genuine ones.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each company: - Company X bought exactly 10 packages, so they pay the full price for each package: 10 packages * 25/package = 250. - Company Y bought 8 packages, so they pay the full price for the first 10 packages (which is covered by Company X's purchase) and get a discount for the packages in excess of 10. Since they only bought 8 packages, all are at full price: 8 packages * 25/package = 200. - Company Z bought 33 packages, so they pay the full price for the first 10 packages (covered by Company X) and get a discount for the 23 packages in excess of 10: 10 packages * 25/package + 23 packages * (25/package * 4/5) = 250 + 23 packages * 20/package = 250 + 460 = 710.

To solve this, we can use an idea related to graph theory. Let's represent the delegates as vertices in a graph and the acquaintance relationships between the delegates as edges between the vertices. Given that every delegate (vertex) knows at least one other delegate (i.e., has at least one edge connected to it) but not all delegates (i.e., the degree of each vertex is between 1 and (n-2) where (n) is the total number of delegates), we aim to show that this graph can be bi-partitioned into two subsets where each vertex has at least one edge within its subset. We proceed as follows: 1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose it is not possible to partition the delegates into two groups such that each person knows at least one person within their own group. 2. **Create a Counterexample**: If such a partition were not possible, it would mean there exists at least one subset of the delegates where every delegate in that subset is only connected to delegates in the other subset and not within their own group. 3. **Graph bipartition**: This contradiction leads us to consider a bipartite graph scenario but not strictly constraint as it allows some internal edges within the groups as well. The essence of the solution lies in showing the existence of at least one valid partition with internal connections. Let's consider the graph (G) formed by the delegates (vertices) and their acquaintances (edges): - We have already noted each vertex (v) has (1 leq deg(v) leq n-2). - Use the Handshaking Lemma: Every graph is even-degree endowed i.e., sum of degrees of all vertices is even, implying some level of balancing in partitions is possible, aiding our sought partition plan. 4. **Partition Strategy**: Use an iterative approach: - Start with any vertex, say (v_0), and place it in group (A). - Place all vertices adjacent to (v_0) in group (B). - For each vertex (w) in group (B), if a new vertex (u) adjacent to (w) is not yet in any group, place it in group (A). Continue this process ensuring all delegates receive assignment. 5. **Check and Reassure valid Partitioning**: - Confirm no vertices violate being grouped without any intra-group connections. - If a vertex (v) reaches a placement state not meeting the acquaintance condition, redistribute reconsidering depth of connections, ensuring if revisited vertices hold stable acquaintances encompassing minimum one connection within group. By iterating the placement checking internal group connections, ensuring every vertex holds atleast the initial known condition, the bipartitioning groups formed allow every delegate acquainted within either groups. **Conclusion**: Thus, we confirm and construct possible partitioning of symposium delegates effectively, thereby: [ boxed{text{Valid partitioning achievable as required}} ]"},{"prompt":"Nicole found five caterpillars in her backyard: one orange, one green, one blue, one yellow, and one red.

The height of the triangle (and thus the cone) is equal to one of the legs of the triangle, which is simplified as r. 4. Using the formula for the volume of a cone, V = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h, where h = r, we get: V = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 r = frac{1}{3} pi r^3.

This is because, in a regular pentagon, the lengths of the sides connecting any two vertices are consistent, making at least one pair of sides equal. 4. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, these three vertices (A), (B), and (C) form an isosceles triangle with vertices of the same color. - Thus, we have proved that no matter how the circle is colored in two colors, it is always possible to find an isosceles triangle whose vertices are all the same color, inscribed within the circle.

To do this, note that if d is any common divisor of a_m and a_n, then: [ d mid (2^m - 3) quad text{and} quad d mid (2^n - 3) ] so, we have: [ d mid ((2^m - 3) - (2^n - 3)) = 2^m - 2^n. ] 4. **Divisibility for Powers of Two**: - Use the fact that 2^m - 2^n = 2^n(2^{m-n} - 1). - Thus, d must also divide 2^n(2^{m-n} - 1). - We know (d) must also divide (2^m - 3) which is odd (as all terms of the form 2^n - 3 for n > 2 are odd). 5. **Confirming Relative Primality**: - Since (d) must be odd (it divides an odd number), it cannot divide 2^n (a power of 2). - This implies (d) must divide (2^{m-n} - 1). - If d divides both (2^m - 3) and (2^n - 3), it must divide their difference, which is (2^n (2^{m-n} - 1)), forcing (d) to also divide 2^{m-n} - 1. 6. **Distinctiveness of Powers**: - Consider any two distinct numbers a_m = 2^m - 3 and a_n = 2^n - 3 where (mneq n). - 2^{m-n}-1 will not be a multiple of 3 unless m - n = 1, which only affects specific cases. - For general (m > n), these differences (2^{m-n}-1) are composite or larger prime factors. # Conclusion Hence, the sequence {2^n - 3} contains an infinite subsequence where the gcd of any pair of distinct elements is always 1.

In any group of n2 of them, any one person of the group has contacted with other people in this group for 3^k times, where k is a nonnegative integer. Determine all the possible value of n.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We are given ( n ) people, and any two of them have contacted each other at most once. In any group of ( n-2 ) people, each person in the group has contacted the others exactly ( 3^k ) times, where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. We need to determine all possible values of ( n ). 2. **Initial conditions**: Since ( k ) is a non-negative integer, the smallest value ( 3^k ) can take is 1 (when ( k = 0 )). This implies that ( n geq 4 ) because if ( n < 4 ), the condition ( 3^k ) cannot be satisfied. 3. **Case ( n = 4 )**: If ( n = 4 ), we can easily verify that ( k = 0 ) works. In this case, each person in any group of ( 2 ) people has contacted the other exactly once, which is ( 3^0 = 1 ). Therefore, ( n = 4 ) is a valid solution. 4. **General case ( n geq 5 )**: We need to consider the general case where ( n geq 5 ) and ( k geq 1 ). We represent the ( n ) people as points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ). If ( A_i ) has contacted ( A_j ), we add an edge between these two points. 5. **Existence of edges**: There must be at least one edge in the graph. Without loss of generality, assume there is an edge between ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). 6. **Considering groups of ( n-2 ) people**: If there is no edge between ( A_1 ) and ( A_3 ), consider the groups ( {A_1, A_4, A_5, ldots, A_n} ), ( {A_2, A_4, A_5, ldots, A_n} ), and ( {A_3, A_4, A_5, ldots, A_n} ). By the problem's conditions, ( A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ) must have the same number of edges with ( A_4, A_5, ldots, A_n ), denoted as ( m ). 7. **Calculating total edges**: Adding ( A_2 ) to the group ( {A_1, A_4, A_5, ldots, A_n} ), the total number of edges in the ( n-1 ) points is ( S = 3^k + m + 1 ). Removing any point from the ( n-1 ) points, the remaining ( n-2 ) points have ( 3^k ) edges, so each point has ( m + 1 ) edges with the other ( n-2 ) points. Thus, ( S = frac{1}{2} (n-1)(m+1) ). 8. **Consistency check**: Similarly, adding ( A_3 ) to the group ( {A_1, A_4, A_5, ldots, A_n} ), the total number of edges in the ( n-1 ) points is ( t = 3^k + m = frac{1}{2} (n-1)m ). Therefore, ( S = t + 1 ), leading to the equation: [ frac{1}{2}(n-1)(m+1) = frac{1}{2}(n-1)m + 1 ] Simplifying this, we get: [ (n-1)(m+1) = (n-1)m + 2 implies n-1 = 2 implies n = 3 ] This leads to a contradiction since ( n geq 5 ). 9. **Existence of edges between all pairs**: Therefore, there must be an edge between ( A_1 ) and ( A_3 ). By similar reasoning, there must be an edge between any pair ( (A_i, A_j) ) for ( i neq j ). 10. **Final equation**: The total number of edges in a complete graph of ( n-2 ) vertices is: [ 3^k = frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-3) ] Solving for ( n ), we get: [ 3^k = frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-3) ] For ( k = 1 ): [ 3 = frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-3) implies 6 = (n-2)(n-3) implies n^2 - 5n + 6 = 0 implies (n-2)(n-3) = 0 ] Thus, ( n = 2 ) or ( n = 3 ), which is not possible since ( n geq 5 ). For ( k = 2 ): [ 9 = frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-3) implies 18 = (n-2)(n-3) implies n^2 - 5n + 6 = 0 implies (n-2)(n-3) = 0 ] Thus, ( n = 5 ).

If such an a exists, find its value; if not, explain why.","completion":"(1) Since g(x) = frac{ln x}{x}, we have g'(x) = frac{1-ln x}{x^2}. Hence, a = g'(1) = 1, and so f(x) = x - ln x, where x > 0. Differentiating f(x) gives f'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x-1}{x}. Setting f'(x) = 0, we solve for x = 1. When f'(x) > 0, which occurs when x > 1, the function increases. When f'(x) < 0, which occurs for 0 < x < 1, the function decreases. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (1, +infty) and decreasing on the interval (0, 1). (2) Let us assume that there exists a real number a such that f(x) has a minimum value of 3 in the interval [0, e]. Case 1: When a leq 0, since x in (0, e], we have f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [0, e]. Thus, the minimum of f(x) would occur at x = e. So we set f(e) = ae - 1 = 3, which gives a = frac{4}{e} (discard this result as it conflicts with the assumption a leq 0). Case 2: When 0 < frac{1}{a} < e, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, frac{1}{a}) and increasing on (frac{1}{a}, e]. Therefore, the minimum of f(x) occurs at x = frac{1}{a}. Hence fleft(frac{1}{a}right) = a cdot frac{1}{a} - ln a = 1 + ln a = 3. Solving for a gives us a = e^2, which meets the requirements. Case 3: When frac{1}{a} geq e, since x in (0, e], we have f'(x) < 0. Hence, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [0, e]. Thus, the minimum of f(x) occurs at x = e. Setting f(e) = ae - 1 = 3, we obtain a = frac{4}{e} (discard this result as it conflicts with the assumption frac{1}{a} geq e).

Since A and B are points of intersections of the circles, the line segment AB's midpoint is also the midpoint of the line segment connecting the centers of the two circles, which are C_1(3,0) and C_2(0,3). The perpendicular bisector of AB will therefore pass through the midpoint of the centers and will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line joining the centers. The slope of the line joining the centers (3,0) and (0,3) is: {text{slope}} = frac{3 - 0}{0 - 3} = -1 Since the desired perpendicular bisector needs to have a negative reciprocal of this slope, it should have a slope of 1 (since the negative reciprocal of -1 is 1). Now finding the equation of this line: Since the line has a slope of 1 and passes through the midpoint of the centers, which is easily found by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of (3,0) and (0,3) to get left( frac{3+0}{2}, frac{0+3}{2} right) = (1.5, 1.5), we can write the equation of the line using point-slope form: y - 1.5 = 1(x - 1.5) Simplifying this equation: y - 1.5 = x - 1.5 y = x To move the line to the exact bisector position, we know it must pass through (3,0) and (0,3). Thus, the perpendicular bisector intersects (1.5, 1.5), the midpoint of (3,0) and (0,3).

The function ( g(x) ) has a minimum value of 0 as ( x ) approaches infinity, since ( lim_{x to infty} frac{1}{x^2 + 1} = 0 ). To find the maximum, observe that ( x^2 + 1 ) achieves its minimum value of 1 when ( x = 0 ). Thus, at ( x = 0 ), ( g(x) = frac{1}{1} = 1 ). For any ( y ) in the interval ( (0, 1] ), there exists an ( x ) such that ( g(x) = y ).

This can be rewritten as f(x_1) - 2x_1 < f(x_2) - 2x_2 for any x_1 < x_2.

For g(x) to be increasing, the coefficient of x must be less than 0, which gives us a + 2 < 0 or a < -2. 3. **Analyzing g(x) for x > 1**: For x > 1, g(x) = frac{1}{3}x^3 - frac{3}{2}ax^2 + (2a^2 + 2)x - frac{11}{6}. The derivative g'(x) = x^2 - 3ax + 2a^2 helps us understand the behavior of g(x). - When frac{3a}{2} leq 1, or a leq frac{2}{3}, evaluating g'(1) gives 1 - 3a + 2a^2 geq 0, which simplifies to a leq frac{1}{2}. - When frac{3a}{2} > 1, or a > frac{2}{3}, evaluating g'(frac{3a}{2}) gives -frac{1}{4}a^2 geq 0, which is not possible for real numbers a. 4. **Comparing g(x) at x=1 for both cases**: We also need to ensure continuity and increasing nature at x=1 by comparing 2 - (a + 2) with frac{1}{3} - frac{3}{2}a + 2a^2 - frac{11}{6}. This simplifies to 4a^2 - a - 3 geq 0, which gives a leq -frac{3}{4} or a geq 1. 5. **Conclusion**: Combining all conditions, we find that the only valid range for a that satisfies all conditions is a < -2.

The goal is to determine whether it's possible to gather all the herrings into one sector by moving two herrings from adjacent sectors in opposite directions in each move. 2. To explore this, we'll begin by coloring the sectors in an alternating fashion, such as white and black. This creates a pattern where no two adjacent sectors share the same color. Specifically, we will alternate between white and black until all sectors are colored. 3. At the start, we have three herrings in white sectors and three herrings in black sectors. 4. When the described operation is performed — where two herrings from adjacent sectors are moved in opposite directions — the colors of the sectors they move to change relative to their initial positions. For instance, a herring moving from a white sector to a black sector changes its color, and vice versa. 5. This swapping results in a herring from a white sector moving to a black sector and a herring from a black sector moving to a white sector. Thus, after each move, there will still be three black-sector herrings and three white-sector herrings. The overall count of herrings in white and black sectors remains unchanged despite these moves. 6. Therefore, due to the invariant nature of the distribution of herrings in white and black sectors, it is impossible to concentrate all six herrings into a single sector, as it would require all six herrings to be in sectors of the same color. # Conclusion: Because it is impossible to change the equilibrium of three white-sector herrings and three black-sector herrings through the permissible moves, the herrings cannot all be gathered into one sector. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let triangle ABC have side lengths AB=24, BC=26, and AC=28.

We know that the pharmacist needs 4.5 liters of each solution to make 6 liters of a 50% iodine mixture.

Conclusion: The first (leftmost) digit of ( N ) is ( boxed{9} )."},{"prompt":"Which of the following is equivalent to [(2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})?] textbf{(A)} ~3^{127} + 2^{127} qquadtextbf{(B)} ~3^{127} + 2^{127} + 2 cdot 3^{63} + 3 cdot 2^{63} qquadtextbf{(C)} ~3^{128}2^{128} qquadtextbf{(D)} ~3^{128} + 2^{128} qquadtextbf{(E)} ~5^{127}","completion":"We are given the expression: [ (2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64}) ] and need to find an equivalent form among the provided options. 1. **Introduce a Factor of 1**: Multiply the expression by 1 in the form of (3-2): [ (3-2)(2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64}) ] 2. **Apply the Difference of Squares**: We use the identity (a^n - b^n)(a^n + b^n) = a^{2n} - b^{2n} repeatedly. Start by applying it to the first two terms: [ (3-2)(3+2) = 3^2 - 2^2 ] Now, include the next term (2^2+3^2) and apply the identity again: [ (3^2 - 2^2)(3^2 + 2^2) = 3^4 - 2^4 ] Continue this process with the next term (2^4+3^4): [ (3^4 - 2^4)(3^4 + 2^4) = 3^8 - 2^8 ] Repeat this process for each subsequent pair: [ (3^8 - 2^8)(3^8 + 2^8) = 3^{16} - 2^{16} ] [ (3^{16} - 2^{16})(3^{16} + 2^{16}) = 3^{32} - 2^{32} ] [ (3^{32} - 2^{32})(3^{32} + 2^{32}) = 3^{64} - 2^{64} ] [ (3^{64} - 2^{64})(3^{64} + 2^{64}) = 3^{128} - 2^{128} ] 3. **Conclusion**: After applying the difference of squares identity successively, we find that the original expression simplifies to: [ boxed{3^{128} - 2^{128}} ] Thus, the correct answer is textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128}."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],W={key:0},L={key:1};function E(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
