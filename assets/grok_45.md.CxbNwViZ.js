This is a process where under the rule of equal exchange of commodities, some commodity producers gradually lose their property because other commodity producers produce more efficiently. Class differentiation of commodity producers results in the formation of capitalists and proto-capitalists, but also independent non-exploiting producers and semi-proletarians (the latter two groups constitute what I call small-scale producers).2 Small-scale producers are adversely impacted by the capitalist class in at least three different but connected ways. Firstly, when they work as wage labourers for a part of the year, they are exploited like full-time wage labourers. Secondly, they are dispossessed of their property by the capitalist class and its state through primitive accumulation. Thirdly, they do not receive the full price of the products of their labour from the capitalist class and its state, so they are exploited in the commodity market; they may also pay a high price for the things they need (inputs; insurance, bank-loans, etc.). Apart from being impacted by the capitalist class, small-scale producers are also exploited by the landlords/money-lenders (on the basis of appropriation of ground rent and usurious interest). Exploitation of small-scale producers by elements of the ruling class cannot happen without the support of the state: this fact Lenin under-emphasized. It is the state that codifies the rules of the commodity exchange. The state also codifies and defends the rights of the propertied classes (e.g. moneylenders and merchants) to alienate direct producers from their property when, for example, the latter fail to pay back their loan. Small-scale producers often go into debt because the cost of the means of production and subsistence produced by capitalists is too high. The terms of trade between small-scale commodity production and large-scale commodity production being against the former can be countered by the state, and yet the state allows small-scale producers to incur a loss and go into a debt.3 They lose their property until they become property-less (pauperization is followed by proletarianization).4 Capitalist private property is based on the state-mediated negation of small-scale private property based in own labour or family labour. The market-based process of class-differentiation can involve violence as well: if an independent producer (e.g. a peasant) owes a loan to a moneylender or to a bank and if they do not surrender their assets in return for the loan because they wish to protect their livelihood, then violence is used against the independent producers. An important question to ask: why can the state not socialize the debt of small-scale producers (all those who are not net buyers of other people’s labour power)? After all, the state routinely forgives billions of dollars that big businesses owe to state-owned banks or otherwise makes available to the big business free money. This is important to ask in order to understand where the state’s necessary bias lies and to see that commodity exchange based on private property is partly a political (state-mediated) process.5 State’s taxes on subsistence goods (indirect taxes in general) — an extra- economic intervention — can contribute to the expropriation of small-scale producers, including peasants (Cleaver, 2019: 82). Indeed, tax on workers and small-scale producers is an indirect form of ‘exploitation’ by the state, a state which fails to look after the common interests of these classes. To understand the relation between the state and small-scale producers, one might ask: why does the state not exempt them from taxation (while it gives billions of dollars of tax exemption to the big business)? It is also important to note that state’s defence of commodity relations on the basis of equality and freedom produces unfreedom and inequality in the sphere of property relations which the state defends; unfreedom because those who have private property in labour but not in means of production and have become the net sellers of labour power are not free not to sell that property to the capitalist class; inequality because those who are owners of private property in labour and owners of the products of their labour (i.e. small-scale producers), when unable to pay their bills, lose their property; some of them come to have more property than others, and some of them become net buyers of labour power, and others become net sellers of labour power (Lenin, 1899: chapter 2). 3 State-assisted extra-economic ‘production’ of capitalist private property The second process in which small-scale producers lose their property giving rise to the emergence of capitalist property rights holders is what Marx calls primitive accumulation, which involves the state (this is the subject of my detailed theoretical study in the sequel to this book). The state typically enables the forcible separation of direct producers from their private property and from access to communal property and contributes to the emergence of private property in its capitalist form. The state thus produces an important condition for capitalism, that is, ‘the owner of money [finds] labour-power in the market as a commodity’ (Marx, 1887: 119). This means that ‘instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which his [or her] labour is incorporated’, a person ‘must be obliged to offer for sale as a commodity that very labour-power, which exists only in his [or her] living self’ (ibid.). The state must reproduce, and it does reproduce, a significant section of people as sellers of labour power, that is, as wage workers, and not as people who can sell goods and services that they produce by using their labour power. In modern times, one can observe a ‘property circuit’ (somewhat similar to capital circuit and labour circuit I have mentioned earlier). It can be represented as P-S-C. The state takes property from small-scale producers (P) through a combination market mechanisms and extra-market mechanisms. The market mechanisms include two. One is that the systemic neglect of rural areas and the rural periphery of city-regions by the state, especially, in the South, drives down the price of land, allowing the state (and/or capitalists) to buy it cheap. This is akin to a massive gentrification process. Another is that rural impoverishment due to the systemic neglect by the state and exploitation by different property-owning strata can induce some small-scale producers to sell their land ‘voluntarily’. In any case, after obtaining the property, the state holds it as state property (S) temporarily as a bank holds money. And then state property is turned over to capitalists at a cheaper rate, and thus it becomes capitalist private property (C). Of course, sometimes, P-S-C can be shortened to P-C, when capitalists directly buy/obtain property from small-scale producers, with the help of the state (including its police and judiciary). The transition from P to C takes time, in part because of small-scale produc- ers/owners’ opposition to alienation/dispossession of their property as such or alienation/ dispossession for a given compensation. The more the time, the greater the loss of potential profit for capitalists, including from speculation on the property following alienation. State coercion is needed to shorten the transition time. One reason why many small-scale producers are reluctant to part with their property is that while capitalists (and their state) wish to get the land at a cheaper rate, small-scale producers wish to get a higher price — higher relative to current market conditions and higher relative to what the price of the property would be in the near future due to speculative rise in the price. Another reason is that after losing their property, they are not sure that they can obtain decent and secure employment in the capitalist enterprises that might be established (as an alternative to the current self-employment on their own property). Whether property is transferred, and at what price, partly depends on the balance of power between small-scale owners on the one hand and the state/capitalists on the other. Capital does not always get what it wants, but it generally does, thanks to the role of the state. Following the coercive dispossession from their property (and/or alienation from property through market mechanisms), the direct producers are now turned into new class subjects (workers for capitalists). The state then subjects them to a series of processes: statistical investigation and classification (they are classified on the basis of occupation, location, income, and so on), a degree of economic consolation (e.g. policies aimed at poverty alleviation or poor relief), and ideological, including religious indoctrination. They are also subjected to physical coercion, criminalization,6 and disciplinary action. It is indeed not enough that the state forcibly separates direct producers from their means of production (and subsistence such as homestead or cottages) and creates a proletariat. Marx says that following ‘the forcible creation of a class of outlawed proletarians’, it was the ‘bloody discipline that turned them into wage-labourers’ (Marx, 1887: 528). They were subjected to ‘disgraceful action of the State which employed the police to accelerate the accumulation of capital by increasing the degree of exploitation of labour’ (ibid.). The newly created class of workers must be made to be accustomed to working for the capitalists and must be used to working for long hours. Being forced to choose between starving and working for a wage, and thus being compelled to choose the latter, people begin to agree to — that is, give consent to — living like wage workers. This indicates that coercion, both economic and extra-economic, creates consent. Of course, notions of equality, freedom, and the like contribute to the consent-process as did notion of(colonial- style) paternalism, especially, in the South.7 The process of primitive accumulation (or alienation from small-scale pro-ducers’ property), which is state-aided, creates two things: (a) the wage-labour class, a class of people which lives as long as it can sell its only commodity (labour power), and (b) owner of private property in its capitalist form. As we have already seen, the capitalist form of private property is different from other forms in that ‘determined by big industry and universal competition’, it is ‘pure private property, which has cast off all semblance of a communal institution and has shut out the State from any influence on the development of property’ (Marx and Engels, 1845). Marx’s ‘any influence’, of course, exaggerates the separation between the state and capitalist private property a bit.”翻译为中文","completion":"2 国家介导的阶级分化作为资本主义私有财产的基础 一种是阶级分化，这是一个过程，列宁在《俄国资本主义发展史》(列宁，1899)等作品中比马克思和其他经典的马克思主义者更详细地分析了这一过程。这是一个在商品平等交换规则下，一些商品生产者逐渐失去其财产，因为其他商品生产者更高效地生产。商品生产者的阶级分化导致资本家和原始资本家的形成，但也导致独立的非剥削生产者和半无产者（后两组构成了我所说的小规模生产者）的形成。小规模生产者至少以三种不同但相互连接的方式受到资本家阶级的负面影响。首先，当他们在一年的部分时间作为雇佣劳动者工作时，他们像全职雇佣劳动者一样被剥削。其次，他们通过原始积累被资本家阶级及其国家剥夺了财产。第三，他们没有从资本家阶级及其国家那里获得其劳动产品的全部价格，因此他们在商品市场上被剥削；他们也可能为他们需要的东西（原料；保险、银行贷款等）支付高价。除了受到资本家阶级的影响，小规模生产者还被地主/放债人（基于土地租金和高利贷的占有）剥削。 小规模生产者受统治阶级元素剥削，离不开国家的支持：这一事实列宁未能充分强调。是国家编制商品交换的规则。国家还编纂并捍卫有产阶级（例如放债人和商人）的权利，当直接生产者例如未能偿还贷款时，剥夺他们的财产。小规模生产者经常因为资本家生产的生产资料和生存资料成本过高而负债。小规模商品生产与大规模商品生产之间的贸易条件不利于前者，国家可以对抗这一点，但国家却允许小规模生产者蒙受损失并负债。他们失去财产直到变成无产者（贫困化后是无产阶级化）。资本主义私有财产建立在以国家介导否定基于自己劳动或家庭劳动的小规模私有财产之上。基于市场的阶级分化过程也可能涉及暴力：如果一个独立生产者（如农民）欠放债人或银行贷款，如果他们因为希望保护自己的生计而不交出财产作为贷款的回报，那么就会对独立生产者使用暴力。 一个重要问题是：为什么国家不能为小规模生产者（所有非净买入他人劳动力的人）社会化债务？毕竟，国家经常免除大企业欠国有银行的数十亿美元债务，或者以其他方式为大企业提供免费的资金。这个问题的提出很重要，以了解国家的必要偏见在哪里，以及看到基于私有财产的商品交换部分是一个政治（国家介导的）过程。 国家对生存商品征税（一般是间接税）——一种额外经济干预——可能导致小规模生产者，包括农民的财产被剥夺（Cleaver, 2019: 82）。事实上，对工人和小规模生产者征税是国家的一种间接形式的“剥削”，这个国家未能照顾到这些阶级的共同利益。为了理解国家与小规模生产者之间的关系，人们可能会问：为什么国家不免除他们的税收（同时给予大企业数十亿美元的税收减免）？ 同样重要的是要注意，国家基于平等和自由的商品关系防御，在国家捍卫的财产关系领域产生了不自由和不平等；不自由，因为那些拥有劳动力私有财产而不是生产资料的私有财产，变成了劳动力的净卖者，他们没有不将这种财产出售给资本家阶级的自由；不平等，因为那些是劳动力私有财产的所有者和他们劳动产品（即小规模生产者）的所有者，当无法支付账单时，失去了他们的财产；有些人拥有的财产比其他人多，有些人变成了劳动力的净买家，而其他人变成了劳动力的净卖家（列宁，1899：第2章）。 3 国家协助的额外经济“生产”资本主义私有财产 小规模生产者失去财产，从而出现了资本主义产权持有者的第二个过程，是马克思所称的原始积累，其中涉及到国家（这是我在本书续集中的详细理论研究的主题）。国家通常使直接生产者被强制与其私有财产和公共财产的使用权分离，并促成了资本主义形式的私有财产的出现。国家因此创造了资本主义的一个重要条件，即“金钱的所有者在市场上找到劳动力作为一种商品”（马克思，1887：119）。这意味着一个人“不是处于能够出售包含了他[或她]的劳动的商品的位置，而是必须被迫将那种只存在于他[或她]的活生生的自我中的劳动力作为商品出售”（同上）。国家必须再生产，并且确实在再生产一个重要部分的人作为劳动力的卖者，即作为工资工人，而不是作为可以出售他们利用其劳动力生产的商品和服务的人。 在现代，可以观察到一个“财产循环”（与我之前提到的资本循环和劳动循环有些相似）。可以表示为P-S-C。国家通过市场机制和非市场机制从小规模生产者（P）那里拿走财产。市场机制包括两种。一种是国家对农村地区和城市-农村边缘地区的系统性忽视，尤其是在南方，导致土地价格下降，使国家（和/或资本家）能够廉价购买。这类似于大规模的绅士化过程。另一种是由于国家的系统性忽视和不同拥有财产阶层的剥削导致的农村贫困，可能促使一些小规模生产者“自愿”出售他们的土地。无论如何，获得财产后，国家暂时将其作为国有财产持有，就像银行持有钱一样。然后，以更便宜的价格将国有财产转让给资本家，从而成为资本家的私有财产（C）。当然，有时，P-S-C可以缩短为P-C，当资本家在国家（包括其警察和司法）的帮助下直接从小规模生产者那里买得/获得财产时。 从P到C的转变需要时间，部分是因为小规模生产者/所有者反对其财产被剥夺/失去，或因为给定的补偿而被剥夺/失去。时间越长，资本家的潜在利润损失越大，包括由于剥夺后对财产的投机。需要国家强制力来缩短过渡时间。许多小规模生产者不愿意放弃他们的财产的一个原因是，虽然资本家（及其国家）希望以更便宜的价格获得土地，小规模生产者希望获得更高的价格——高于当前市场条件，以及由于投机导致的价格在不久的将来的上涨。另一个原因是，失去财产后，他们不确定能否在可能建立的资本主义企业中获得体面和安全的就业（作为当前在自己财产上的自雇的替代）。财产是否转移，以及以什么价格转移，部分取决于小规模所有者与国家/资本家之间的力量平衡。资本并不总是得到它想要的，但它通常会，多亏了国家的作用。 在通过强制剥夺其财产（和/或通过市场机制与财产脱离）之后，直接生产者现在转变为新的阶级主体（为资本家工作的工人）。然后，国家将他们置于一系列过程之下：统计调查和分类（他们根据职业、位置、收入等被分类）、一定程度的经济安慰（例如，旨在缓解贫困或救济穷人的政策）、和意识形态，包括宗教灌输。他们也受到物理强制、刑事化、和纪律行动的影响。正如马克思所说，仅仅强制将直接生产者与其生产资料（和生活资料，如住宅或小屋）分离并创造出无产阶级是不够的。马克思说，在“通过暴力创造一群被放逐的无产者”之后，是“残酷的纪律将他们变成了雇佣劳动者”（马克思，1887：528）。他们受到了“国家的可耻行动，该国家利用警察加速通过增加劳动剥削程度来积累资本”的影响。新创造的工人阶级必须习惯为资本家工作，并习惯长时间工作。 被迫在挨饿和为工资工作之间做出选择，因而被迫选择后者，人们开始同意——即，对作为雇佣劳动者的生活表示同意。这表明，经济和非经济的强制都创造了同意。当然，平等、自由等观念也对同意的过程有所贡献，就像殖民地风格的家长制观念在南方特别如此。原始积累的过程（或从小规模生产者财产中剥离），这是国家支持的，创造了两件事：（a）工资劳动阶级，一个只要能卖出其唯一商品（劳动力）就能生存的阶级，（b）资本主义形式的私有财产拥有者。正如我们已经看到的，资本主义形式的私有财产与其他形式不同，因为“由大工业和普遍竞争决定”，它是“纯粹的私有财产，已经摆脱了所有公共机构的外表，也把国家从对财产发展的任何影响中排除出去”（马克思和恩格斯，1845）。马克思的“任何影响”，当然，对国家与资本主义私有财产之间的分离有所夸张。"},{"prompt":"请将“While the state has to ensure separation of small-scale producers from their means of production and subsistence on a significant scale, this separation is not necessarily a once-and-for-all process. Note that not all small-scale owners must be dispossessed and become wage workers for capitalism (to begin) to work. This means that there are always small-scale owners who may need to be dispossessed because capital needs their wage-labour and/or their means of production (farm land, water bodies, forested land, mining land, and so on). So, the state must continuously be involved in the act of separating small-scale owners from their property on behalf of capital as per its need. The state must also continuously stop workers from having direct — non-market — access to means of subsistence (and not just to means of production). This act is made possible in many ways. For one thing, even if the state has enough food under its control, it would not make it available to the poor for free, on the ground that, for example, such an action would promote idleness and create labour shortage. For another, there are laws against begging and vagabondage.8 The world produces enough food, and yet close to a billion people go without food. Food riots represent people’s demand to have direct (affordable) access to food.9 Similarly, when people squat on vacant urban land and empty buildings as in Brazil where there is a powerful landless rural workers movement, they are demanding access to land and shelter. The state ensures that people do not have direct access to what they need, so not surprisingly, the state heavily suppresses people’s action. Such suppression is not a happenstance. It is the essence of the state: it is to keep a significant number of direct producers separated from means of production and subsistence forcing them to work for a wage. So such a separation cannot happen without another separation: people being separated from state’s coercive apparatuses and powers. Political suppression of people’s demand for direct access to means of subsistence is a condition for capitalist mode of production. Partly because of struggle from below in different forms, there came to exist state provision of means of subsistence (e.g. public housing, healthcare and education, subsidized nutrition programme), and state-directed/-owned pro-ductive enterprises, including in ex-‘communist’ countries or in post-colonial societies. These state-provided means of subsistence or state-controlled means of production (state’s enterprises) are partly or wholly in the form of non-commodities (or property which is not capitalist in form proper). They form the social commons akin to communal means of subsistence in pre-capitalist societies and contributed to partial ‘de-proletarianization’.10 They therefore offer opportunities for primitive accumulation in contemporary times via their privatization and transfer to the hands of the capitalist class. This Marx did not quite encounter. Such a modern form of primitive accumulation ensures that a class of property-less direct producers, separated from means of production and subsistence, continues to exist, and this ensures uninterrupted sale and purchase of labour power as a commodity. As mentioned earlier, an entire population does not have to lose its property for capitalism to exist. Indeed, sometimes, a limited amount of means of pro-duction and subsistence in the hands of workers might help contribute to the cost of their reproduction and thus reduce the wages that capitalists have to pay. Also sometimes, when capitalism fails to address the problem of unemployment, the state encourages petty business, even by giving small loans to workers and small-scale producers, including women.11 Consider micro-credit policies and state assistance to micro-enterprises. Thus, a ‘reverse primitive accumulation’ can happen with the support of the state: this can take the form of poor people given some land taken from large-scale owners or small government loans to set up small businesses. The foregoing discussion shows that the absolutely fundamental purpose of the capitalist state, as a class-state, is to defend the capitalist form of private property (not necessarily private property as such) on the basis of threat and actual use of the means of violence. As mentioned earlier, the social relations of production between classes (and intra-capitalist relations) are codified in the form of state laws, producing what are strictly called property relations or juridical relations. The right to charge an interest and rent and the right to appropriate surplus value are juridically defended by the state, in the overall interest of the capitalist property owners. Of course, all this does not mean that the state cannot and does not go against the short-term or long-term interests of individual members of the capitalist class or indeed against certain shortterm economic interests of the class as a whole in order to preserve its class rule. As Engels says, ‘rarely it happens that a code of law is the blunt, unmitigated, unadulterated expression of the domination of a class’ (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 399-400). Whether the owner of labour power or of any other commodity, everyone is a commodity owner and seller. In addition, all are regarded as equal before the law irrespective of what capital each owns: whether they own land as private property or whether they are poor people who own nothing but their labour power. Indeed, ‘[a]s the rule of law, the bourgeois state treats its citizens as free and equal owners of private property . . . one only acquires property by endowment, inheritance, exchange, or purchase’ (Heinrich, 2004: 204-5).12 So state’s neutrality — as the realm of extra-economic coercion — is not an illusion. Rather, it is precisely by means of this neutrality that ‘the state secures the foundations of capitalist relations of domination and exploitation’ (p. 205). The defence of property of everyone in a neutral manner implies that ‘those who possess no relevant property beyond their own labour-power must sell their labour-power . . . and submit to capital’ (ibid.). 4 Capitalism, theft, and anti-theft laws The entire capitalist mode of production itself is based on stealing and ‘theft’ (note that this theft does not include appropriation of surplus value on the basis of law of value supported by the state). Consider the following examples that Marx himself provides. Capital steals people: ‘Nothing is more characteristic than their system of stealing men’ (slaves) (Marx, 1887: 534). The genesis of capitalism is itself based on ‘colossal scale thefts of state lands’ (p. 512). Laws exist which serve as ‘the instrument of the theft of the people’s land’ (p. 513). Capital engages in ‘the systematic robbery of the Communal lands helped especially, next to the theft of the State domains’ (ibid.). In pursuit of cheap labour, it is engaged in ‘childstealing’ (p. 537). Capital ‘steals the time required for the consumption of fresh air and sunlight’ (p. 179). There are ‘ “small thefts” of capital from the labourer’s meal and recreation time, the factory inspectors also designate as “petty pilfer- ings of minutes” ’ (p. 167). In other words, capital steals people’s life (e.g. slave labour) and people’s wealth (small-scale property). Capital also steals people’s labour (‘extra’ surplus labour) in the sense, for example, that people’s need to enjoy a meal is not respected (haggling over meal times). This happens with — and cannot happen without — the full support of the state. Yet it is the same state that uses force against stealing by poor workers (or small-scale producers), stopping them from obtaining direct access to the necessaries of life. Economically deprived and poor, common people do engage in theft. For example, there were ‘[t]he whole series of thefts, outrages, and popular misery, that accompanied the forcible expropriation of the people, from the last third of the 15 th to the end of the 18th century’ (Marx, 1887: 514). The capitalist state has many laws against theft.13 Anti-theft laws represent the state’s way of stopping people from having direct (= extra-economic) access to means of subsistence (and production). These laws make no distinction between the forms of property being stolen: a person stealing food or such necessaries from a capitalist is not distinguished from a person stealing from a slightly better-off person who is not a capitalist or a landlord.14 While the state takes action against stealing (or robbing) on the part of common people, consider how it is that the state is fully in support of the capitalist, who has ‘bought the use of the labour-power for a definite period’ and who ‘insists upon his rights’, and who therefore ‘has no intention of being robbed’ (Marx, 1887: 137) by workers (workers can rob when they work less than the usual working day or when they work with less than normal intensity or when they waste any resource). The capitalist has ‘a penal code of his own’ (ibid.), a penal code to stop any such robbery, a penal code that, ultimately, cannot exist without the state’s support. 5 Summary, and theoretical and political implications The state is a necessary precondition for value relations and for capitalist property relations. The state makes sure that commodity exchange happens on the basis of the principle of ‘the equivalent for the equivalent’. And, it takes steps to stop the violation of the law of commodity exchange. In certain cases, it itself enforces — or tolerates — unequal exchange as well (in the interest of a hegemonic fraction of the capitalist class, or when the long-term interest of capitalist society is at stake), including at the global scale. In fact, by using extra- economic coercion against small-scale producers and by supporting commodity relations that subject small-scale producers to class differentiation, the state supports the creation of the two basic classes: a class which owns/sells labour power as a commodity and a class that is the (net) buyer of this commodity and that owns the means of production in their commodity form. To the extent that small-scale property owners do remain (they are a substantial presence in rural areas of the South and urban areas of the North), the state fails to meet their needs. They are exploited by both capitalists and all those property owners who appropriate rent and interest, a process that the state also defends.”翻译为中文","completion":"2 国家必须在重大规模上确保小规模生产者与他们的生产和生存手段分离，但这种分离不一定是一劳永逸的过程。请注意，并不是所有小规模所有者都必须被剥夺并成为工资工人，资本主义才能（开始）运作。这意味着，总会有一些可能需要被剥夺的小规模所有者，因为资本需要他们的工资劳动和/或他们的生产手段（农田、水体、森林土地、矿产土地等）。所以，根据资本的需要，国家必须持续代表资本将小规模所有者与他们的财产分离。国家还必须持续阻止工人直接——非市场——获取生存手段（不仅限于生产手段）。这一行为通过许多方式成为可能。例如，即使国家掌控了足够的食物，也不会免费提供给穷人，理由是，例如，这样的行动会促进懒惰并导致劳动力短缺。另外，还有反对乞讨和流浪的法律。 世界上生产的食物足够，但接近十亿人无饭可吃。食物暴动代表人们要求直接（负担得起的）获取食物的需求。同样，当人们像巴西那样在空置的城市土地和空置建筑上搭建棚户时，他们是在要求获取土地和住所的权利。国家确保人们无法直接获取他们所需的东西，因此不足为奇的是，国家严厉镇压人们的行动。这种镇压不是偶然发生的。它是国家的本质所在：使大量直接生产者与生产和生存手段分离，强迫他们为工资工作。因此，这种分离不可能发生而不伴随另一种分离：人们与国家的强制机构和权力分离。政治上压制人们对生存手段直接获取的需求是资本主义生产方式的条件。 部分是因为来自下层的不同形式的斗争，出现了国家提供生存手段（例如公共住房、医疗保健和教育、补贴营养计划），以及国家指导/拥有的生产企业，包括在前“共产主义”国家或后殖民社会。这些国家提供的生存手段或国家控制的生产手段（国家企业）部分或全部以非商品形式存在（或不完全是资本主义形式的产权）。它们形成了类似于前资本主义社会中的公共生存手段的社会公共财，有助于部分“去无产阶级化”。因此，它们为当代通过私有化和转移到资本家手中的原始积累提供了机会。这是马克思没有完全遭遇的。这种现代形式的原始积累确保了一类与生产和生存手段分离的无产者的持续存在，这确保了劳动力作为商品的不间断买卖。 正如前面提到的，整个人口并不需要失去其财产，资本主义才能存在。实际上，有时，工人手中拥有有限量的生产和生存手段可能有助于降低资本家必须支付的工资，从而有助于他们繁殖的成本。同时，当资本主义未能解决失业问题时，国家鼓励小本生意，甚至通过向工人和小规模生产者，包括妇女提供小额贷款。考虑微信贷政策和对微型企业的国家援助。因此，在国家的支持下可以发生“逆向原始积累”：这可以采取将一些土地从大规模所有者手中给予穷人或向建立小企业的人提供小额政府贷款的形式。 前述讨论表明，作为阶级国家的资本主义国家的绝对基本目的是基于威胁和实际使用暴力手段来捍卫资本主义形式的私有财产（不一定是私有财产本身）。如前所述，阶级之间的生产关系（以及资本家内部关系）以国家法律的形式编纂，产生了严格称为产权关系或法律关系。收取利息和租金的权利以及占有剩余价值的权利由国家在资本家产权所有者的整体利益中司法上予以捍卫。当然，这并不意味着国家不能也不会违背资本家阶级个别成员的短期或长期利益，或确实违背阶级作为一个整体的某些短期经济利益，以便维护其阶级统治。正如恩格斯所说，“很少有法律典范是一个阶级统治的直率、无保留、不掺杂的表达”（在马克思和恩格斯，1975：399-400）。 无论是劳动力所有者还是任何其他商品的所有者，每个人都是商品所有者和卖家。此外，所有人都在法律面前平等，无论他们拥有何种资本：无论他们拥有土地作为私人财产，还是贫穷的人除了自己的劳动力外一无所有。实际上，“作为法治，资产阶级国家将其公民视为私有财产自由和平等的所有者……一个人只能通过赠予、继承、交换或购买获得财产”（Heinrich，2004：204-5）。因此国家的中立性——作为额外经济强制的领域——并非幻觉。正是通过这种中立性，“国家确保资本主义统治和剥削关系的基础”（第205页）。以中立的方式捍卫每个人的财产意味着“那些除了自己的劳动力外没有相关财产的人必须出售他们的劳动力……并屈服于资本”（同上）。 4 资本主义、盗窃和反盗窃法律 整个资本主义生产方式本身建立在盗窃和“窃取”之上（注意这种盗窃不包括基于国家支持的价值法则的剩余价值占有）。考虑马克思本人提供的以下例子。 资本窃取人：“最具特征的莫过于他们的偷窃人的系统”（奴隶）（马克思，1887：534）。资本主义的起源本身就基于“国家土地的大规模盗窃”（第512页）。存在作为“窃取人民土地的工具”的法律（第513页）。资本参与了“系统性地抢劫公共土地，尤其是接下来的国家领域的盗窃，对此帮助尤其大”（同上）。在追求廉价劳动力的过程中，它参与了“偷窃儿童”（第537页）。资本“偷窃了呼吸新鲜空气和阳光所需的时间”（第179页）。工厂检查员还将资本从劳动者的膳食和休息时间中的“小偷窃”称为“偷窃分钟”（第167页）。 换句话说，资本窃取了人们的生命（例如奴隶劳动）和人们的财富（小规模财产）。资本还以这样一种意义上窃取了人们的劳动（“额外”的剩余劳动），例如，人们享受一顿饭的需求不被尊重（为用餐时间讨价还价）。这一切发生在——并且没有——国家的全力支持下。然而，同样的国家却对穷困工人（或小规模生产者）的盗窃行为动用武力，阻止他们直接获取生活必需品。经济上被剥夺和贫穷的普通人确实会参与盗窃。例如，有“15世纪后期到18世纪末，随着对人民的强制剥夺，伴随着一系列盗窃、暴行和人民的苦难”（马克思，1887：514）。资本主义国家有许多反盗窃法律。 反盗窃法律代表着国家阻止人们直接（= 非经济）获取生存手段（和生产手段）的方式。这些法律不区分被盗的财产形式：从资本家那里偷取食物或类似必需品的人，与从不是资本家或地主的稍微富裕的人那里偷取的人没有区别。虽然国家采取行动反对普通人的偷窃（或抢劫）行为，但考虑到国家是如何全力支持资本家的，他“购买了一定期限的劳动力使用权”，坚持他的权利，因此“无意被抢劫”（马克思，1887：137）工人（工人可以通过减少通常的工作日或以低于正常强度工作或浪费任何资源来抢劫）。资本家有“他自己的刑法典”（同上），一个阻止任何此类抢劫的刑法典，最终，这个刑法典离不开国家的支持。 5 总结及理论和政治含义 国家是价值关系和资本主义财产关系的必要前提条件。国家确保商品交换基于“等价物换等价物”的原则进行。并且，国家采取措施阻止商品交换法则的违反。在某些情况下，它本身也强制执行——或容忍——不平等交换（以支持资本主义阶级的霸权分支的利益，或当资本主义社会的长远利益受到威胁时），包括在全球范围内。实际上，通过对小规模生产者使用额外经济强制，支持使小规模生产者受到阶级分化的商品关系，国家支持了两个基本阶级的创造：作为商品出售/拥有劳动力的阶级和购买这种商品并拥有以商品形式的生产资料的阶级（净买家）。在小规模财产所有者仍然存在的程度上（他们在南方的农村地区和北方的城市地区占有相当的存在），国家未能满足他们的需求。他们被资本家和所有占有租金和利息的财产所有者剥削，这个过程也被国家捍卫。"},{"prompt":"请将“For capitalism to exist and to continue to exist, the state must separate (and continue to separate) direct producers from the means of production and sub-sistence. And it must ensure that the separated means of production are turned into capital. It must make sure that capitalists as the new ruling class can, like the older ruling classes, appropriate unpaid surplus labour from direct producers. Capitalists do this even while paying the full value of the commodity they purchase (i.e. labour power). The money with which labour power is bought is actually the surplus value that has already been appropriated from workers. That means that the outer limit of the state intervention is this: it must do no more than making sure that commodities are exchanged at value (wages must cover at least the value of labour power) and that there are enough people with a reasonable amount of health and education to work for the capitalists for a wage. In terms of freedom, the situation is better in capitalism than in pre-capitalist societies which lack the kind of equality and freedom that nominally exist under capitalism. Yet one cannot fetishize freedom in the sphere of capitalist exchange that the state protects. But this is exactly what most people do: prompted by the surface appearances of free exchange, they fetishize the idea that there is freedom and equality and that there is respect for private property (private property is sacrosanct), even if millions of small-scale producers lose their property through commodity exchange every year in major capitalist countries. In fact, the Heritage Foundation (2020) speaks for many when it equates economic freedom to freedom from government regulation, which means freedom to buy and sell without government intervention. Ultimately, this freedom to buy and sell is the freedom of large-scale businesses to (a) buy labour power from its owners (the working class), (b) to buy commodities (e.g. raw materials) from small-scale producers, and (c) to sell commodities to small-scale producers and wage workers (e.g. means of production to the former, and means of subsistence to both), in a way that affects these classes adversely. The state protects this specific economic freedom, the freedom of capitalists that exists at the expense of the masses. It is important to note that the ideas about the state and capitalist property presented here go against several prevailing views within Marxism. For example, Fred Block (2019) rejects Marxism’s emphasis on the property-based definition of capitalism. He rejects the Marxist idea that ‘the key factor in understanding any given society is the nature of the property system’, the question of who controls property (p. 1167). He suggests that one must ‘avoid characterizing any particular society as being capitalist’ (p. 1173), that is, a society ‘defined as a regime of private property in which producers seek to profit in competitive markets’ (p. 1167). The property-based view of capitalism cannot explain ‘the huge differences in income inequality’ among capitalist countries. The factors that explain all these differences ‘lie outside of the system of property and production’ (ibid.). He rejects therefore Marxism’s view that ‘[w]ithout transforming that core relationship by ending private ownership of the means of production, reforms that were won today would be reversed tomorrow’ (p. 1167). Block advocates for ‘the Polanyian view of socialism’ which ‘is not tied to property, but rather to the ability of the citizenry, through democratic means, to exercise sovereignty over the market’ (p. 1173). Block assumes that there is no internal relation between capitalist class relation and the legal and political system (i.e. the state), so the latter can be used to meet the needs of the masses. In the post-modernist Marxist view, ‘the ownership of property (whether in means of production or more generally) is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the wielding of power and vice versa’ (Resnick and Wolff, 2006: 119). In this view, communism, which, in Marxism, requires that exploitative private property be abolished, is also a class society because the society as a whole will appropriate and distribute surplus labour from individuals. From the Analytical Marxism camp, Wright is also sceptical of revolutions against capitalist property relations. Echoing the post-modernist view, he says that ‘Anticapitalist revolutions attempt to eliminate the distinctively capitalist form of exploitation’, by putting the means of production in the hands of the state (nationalization), but nationalization would not necessarily affect non- capitalistic exploitation, that is, exploitation based on unequal ownership of such assets as skills/credentials, and nationalization may in fact increase bureaucratic control over people’s lives (Wright, 1989: 20). All these views neglect the fact that Marx and Engels (1871) draw our attention to the ‘economical subjection of the man of labour to the monopolizer of the means of labour; that is, the sources of life lies at the bottom of servitude in all its forms, of all social misery, mental degradation, and political dependence’. In addition, for Marxism, ‘1917’ (the Russian revolution) actually vindicates the Marxist claim that while nationalization of property is the first necessary step, it is not sufficient at all for socialism to be built. Indeed, [i]n order to become social, private property must as inevitably pass through the state stage as the caterpillar in order to become a butterfly must pass through the pupal stage. But the pupa is not a butterfly. Myriads of pupae perish without ever becoming butterflies. State property becomes the property of ‘the whole people’ only to the degree that social privilege and differentiation disappear, and therewith the necessity of the state. (Trotsky, 1991: 201-2) State property itself is not socialism. Marxism knows it. State property is necessary but not sufficient. State property is to be ‘converted into socialist property in proportion as it ceases to be state property’. And the higher the postrevolution state ‘rises above the people, and the more fiercely it opposes itself as the guardian of property to the people as its squanderer, the more obviously does it testify against the socialist character of this state property’ (ibid.). In any case, it is important to reiterate the importance of private property which is closely connected to the state. Property has to be seen as a process and not just a thing. The expansion of wealth or property in capitalism is constituted by a set of state-mediated processes. The first is the commodity production (site of primary exploitation), which operates in relation to and alongside four other processes. One is the realm of commodity exchange and financiali- zation, the site of secondary exploitation, that is, exploitation in the market for consumer goods, in the rental and mortgage market and in the sphere of money-lending, including by the loan sharks as well as big banks. The second is class differentiation (and the tendency towards proletarianization) among commodity producers. This results in the transfer of non-capitalist private property to capitalist private property (or the transfer of private property from weaker capitalists to stronger capitalists more or less on the basis of law of value). The third is ongoing primitive accumulation or dispossession of non-capitalist producers, which also results in the transfer of private property to the capitalist class. Finally, commodity production in its advanced stage tends to develop into imperialism which results in transfer of value and wealth from poorer nations to the richer nations (Das, 2020a). As we have seen, there are at least two main sources of capitalist private property. One form of capitalist private property is from non-capitalist sources: this is when the state takes away the private property of non-capitalist owners and lands it in the hands of the pro-capitalists or capitalists. The other form of capitalist private property, the dominant form in the modern society, is based on capitalist accumulation (as Marx discusses in chapter 25 of Capital volume 1 in great details): this is when surplus value appropriated by capitalists from property-less direct producers (proletarians and semi-proletarians) is reinvested by capitalists to make their business bigger. Thus, the second form of capitalist private property is the form that surplus value takes when the private property of ordinary men and women — private property in labour power — is put to use by the capitalist class. Here as well, the state’s contribution is enormous, including in terms of not only maintaining the already-existing capitalist property but also maintaining and protecting the capitalist right to exploit and to reinvest in order to expand the existing private property (discussed in a later section). Indeed, while the fundamental purpose of the capitalist state is to defend private property in its capitalist form, merely creating and protecting private property as a thing — existing mines, land, plantations, factories, service sector enterprise, banks, capitalist form of knowledge (and intellectual property), and so on — is not enough. Private property seen as a relation and a process, and not a thing, represents the process of materialization of exploitation and accumulation. Capital is value in motion. Money has to be constantly made from private property based on exploitation of labour, and that money must be converted into private property, and the state must ensure this. Therefore, the state’s economic interventions emanate from the state’s fundamental politicalpurpose — the protection of capitalist private property and its augmentation, against any threat from direct producers who must be subjugated. The economic intervention, beyond creation and augmentation of private property through primitive accumulation and class differentiation, takes the form of its contribution to the process of production of value and surplus value, which we will now discuss in Chapter 7. 7 The state, and capitalist production, exploitation accumulation, and crisis In the preface to the first German edition of Capital volume 1, Karl Marx says: ‘It is the ultimate aim of this work [Capital volume 1], to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society’ (Marx, 1887: 7). There are economic laws that explain the ‘spontaneous expansion of capital’ (ibid.: 163) or ‘the successive phases of its normal development’ (ibid.: 7), and then there is state power, including ‘legal enactments’ and legislations or acts (ibid.). The economic laws of capitalism are modified by the laws and actions of state. The actual degree and importance of the modification is a conjunctural matter.”翻译为中文","completion":"为了资本主义的存在和持续存在，国家必须将直接生产者与生产和生存手段分离（并继续分离）。并且它必须确保分离的生产手段转化为资本。它必须确保资本家作为新的统治阶级可以像旧的统治阶级一样，从直接生产者那里占有未支付的剩余劳动。资本家在支付他们购买的商品（即劳动力）的全价值的同时这样做。用来购买劳动力的金钱实际上是已经从工人那里占有的剩余价值。这意味着国家干预的最外层限制是：它必须仅确保商品按价值交换（工资至少要覆盖劳动力的价值），并且有足够多具有合理健康和教育水平的人为资本家工作以换取工资。 在自由方面，资本主义社会的情况比缺乏资本主义下名义上存在的平等和自由的前资本主义社会更好。然而，人们不能在国家保护的资本主义交换领域中对自由进行拜物教化。但这正是大多数人所做的：在自由交换的表面现象的驱使下，他们拜物化了存在自由和平等的观念，以及对私有财产的尊重（私有财产是神圣不可侵犯的），即使每年在主要资本主义国家有数以百万计的小规模生产者通过商品交换失去他们的财产。事实上，遗产基金会（2020）代表了许多人的观点，它将经济自由等同于免于政府监管的自由，这意味着在没有政府干预的情况下买卖的自由。最终，买卖的自由是大型企业的自由，即（a）从其所有者（工人阶级）那里购买劳动力，（b）向小规模生产者购买商品（例如原材料），（c）向小规模生产者和工资工人出售商品（例如对前者生产手段，对两者生存手段），以对这些阶级产生不利影响的方式。国家保护这种特定的经济自由，即以大众为代价存在的资本家的自由。 值得注意的是，在这里提出的关于国家和资本主义财产的观念，与马克思主义内部的几种流行观点相悖。例如，弗雷德·布洛克（2019）拒绝了马克思主义对以财产为基础定义资本主义的强调。他拒绝了马克思的观点，即“理解任何特定社会的关键因素是财产制度的性质”，财产的控制问题（第1167页）。他建议“避免将任何特定社会定性为资本主义社会”（第1173页），即“以私有财产制度定义的社会，生产者在竞争市场中寻求利润”（第1167页）。以财产为基础的资本主义观点无法解释资本主义国家之间巨大的收入不平等差异。解释所有这些差异的因素“位于财产和生产体系之外”（同上）。因此，他拒绝了马克思主义的观点，“如果不通过结束生产手段的私有所有制来转变核心关系，那么今天赢得的改革明天就会被逆转”（第1167页）。布洛克主张“波兰尼式的社会主义观”，“它不是与财产挂钩，而是与公民通过民主手段对市场行使主权的能力挂钩”（第1173页）。布洛克假设资本家阶级关系与法律和政治系统（即国家）之间没有内在关系，因此后者可以用来满足大众的需求。 在后现代主义马克思主义观点中，“财产所有权（无论是生产手段还是更广泛的）既非行使权力的必要条件，也非充分条件，反之亦然”（Resnick和Wolff，2006：119）。在这个观点中，共产主义，它在马克思主义中要求废除剥削性私有财产，也是一个阶级社会，因为社会整体将从个体那里占有并分配剩余劳动。 从分析马克思主义阵营来看，赖特对反对资本主义财产关系的革命也持怀疑态度。呼应后现代主义观点，他说，“反资本主义革命试图消除资本主义特有的剥削形式”，通过将生产手段置于国家手中（国有化），但国有化不一定会影响非资本主义剥削，即基于不平等拥有技能/资格等资产的剥削，并且国有化实际上可能增加对人们生活的官僚控制（Wright，1989：20）。 所有这些观点都忽略了马克思和恩格斯（1871）提醒我们注意的事实：“劳动者经济上受到劳动手段的垄断者，即生命来源的垄断者的支配，是所有形式的奴役、所有社会苦难、精神堕落和政治依赖的根源”。此外，对于马克思主义来说，“1917”（俄国革命）实际上证实了马克思主义的主张，即虽然国有化财产是第一必要步骤，但它根本不足以建立社会主义。事实上， “为了成为社会化的，私有财产必然经历国家阶段，就如同蝴蝶要成为蝴蝶必须经过蛹阶段一样。但蛹不是蝴蝶。大量的蛹未能变成蝴蝶。国有财产只有在社会特权和分化消失，从而国家的必要性随之消失的程度上，才成为‘全民的财产’。 （托洛茨基，1991: 201-2） 国有财产本身不是社会主义。马克思主义知道这一点。国有财产是必要的但不充分的。国有财产应当在“转化为社会主义财产的同时，不再是国有财产”。而且，革命后的国家“越是超越人民，越是作为财产的守护者与人民作为其浪费者对立起来，越是明显地证明了这种国有财产的社会主义性质的缺失”（同上）。 无论如何，强调与国家密切相关的私有财产的重要性很重要。财产应被视为一个过程，而不仅仅是一种物品。资本主义的财富或财产扩张由一系列国家介导的过程构成。首先是商品生产（初级剥削的场所），它与其他四个过程相关并并行存在。一个是商品交换和金融化领域，即二级剥削的场所，也就是消费品市场、租赁和抵押市场以及货币借贷领域（包括放高利贷的人以及大银行）的剥削。第二个是商品生产者之间的阶级分化（以及趋向无产阶级化）。这导致非资本主义私有财产转移到资本主义私有财产（或从较弱的资本家转移到更强的资本家手中，或多或少基于价值法则）。第三个是持续的原始积累或对非资本主义生产者的剥夺，这也导致私有财产转移到资本家阶级手中。最后，商品生产在其高级阶段倾向于发展为帝国主义，导致价值和财富从较贫穷的国家转移到较富裕的国家（Das, 2020a）。 正如我们所见，资本主义私有财产至少有两个主要来源。一种形式的资本主义私有财产来自非资本主义来源：这是当国家夺走非资本主义所有者的私有财产，并使其落入亲资本主义者或资本家手中的情况。资本主义私有财产的另一种形式，即在现代社会中占主导地位的形式，是基于资本主义积累（正如马克思在《资本论》第一卷第25章中详细讨论的）：这是资本家从无产者（无产者和半无产者）那里占有的剩余价值被资本家重新投资以扩大其业务时的情况。因此，资本主义私有财产的第二种形式是剩余价值在普通男女的私有财产——劳动力的私有财产——被资本家阶级利用时呈现的形式。在这里，国家的贡献也是巨大的，包括在维护已经存在的资本主义财产以及维护和保护资本家剥削权利和为了扩大现有私有财产而再投资的权利方面（在后面的部分中讨论）。 确实，尽管资本主义国家的根本目的是捍卫资本主义形式的私有财产，但仅仅创造和保护作为一种物品的私有财产——现有的矿山、土地、种植园、工厂、服务部门企业、银行、资本主义形式的知识（和知识产权）等——是不够的。将私有财产视为一种关系和过程，而非一种物品，代表了剥削和积累的物质化过程。资本是运动中的价值。必须不断地通过劳动剥削基础上的私有财产创造金钱，而且这些金钱必须转化为私有财产，国家必须确保这一点。因此，国家的经济干预源自国家的根本政治目的——保护资本主义私有财产及其增长，对抗任何来自必须被征服的直接生产者的威胁。经济干预，除了通过原始积累和阶级分化创造和增加私有财产外，还表现为其对生产价值和剩余价值的过程的贡献，这将在第7章中讨论。 7 国家与资本主义生产、剥削、积累和危机 在《资本论》第一卷第一版德文版的序言中，卡尔·马克思说：“这项工作的最终目的[《资本论》第一卷]，是揭示现代社会的经济运动法则”（马克思，1887：7）。有经济法则解释了“资本的自发扩张”（同上：163）或“其正常发展的连续阶段”（同上：7），然后是国家权力，包括“法律制定”和立法或法案（同上）。资本主义的经济法则受到国家的法律和行动的修正。实际的修正程度和重要性是一种特定情境的问题。"},{"prompt":"请将“Following the completion of the sale and purchase of commodities, including labour power, the process of capitalist production (labour process) begins under the laws of motion of capital. It is a process in which the capitalist (or its agent) brings the means of production and the worker together to produce a use-value for sale: under capitalism, ‘[t]he labour-process is a process between things that the capitalist has purchased, things that have become his [or her] property’ (Marx, 1887: 131). The workplace, the space of labour process, the hidden abode of production, is a sphere of certain rights of the exploiting class. These rights are defended by the state. Therefore, the sphere of production, including the workplace, reveals important attributes of the state. As in the last two chapters, I partly rely on Capital 1 to show how the logic of capitalist social relations and production create a space, and produce an imperative, for the state to act, whether or not the state does act in a given situation or whether it acts satisfactorily or not from the standpoint of capitalists. In society, fresh wealth (new wealth) cannot be produced merely on the basis of primitive accumulation or even class differentiation (the topics discussed earlier). Fresh wealth cannot also be produced merely on the basis of commodity circulation: surplus value (fresh wealth) cannot be produced inside circulation, although it cannot be produced outside of commodity circulation. Circulation, or the exchange of commodities, itself creates no value. On the basis of circulation and creation of capitalist property from pre-capitalist or non-capitalist (small-scale owners’) property, fresh wealth is ultimately produced inside the hidden abode of production, and it is here that the state plays an important role. The capitalist state is an economically powerful agent. In fact, the part of total social capital that is spent by the state keeps rising, including under neoliberalism.1 Using its economic power (including the power to create money), the state produces those conditions for capitalism which the profit- driven individual capitalists will not generally produce and may indeed destroy. As argued before, capital is value in motion, so it is not enough for the state to merely defend capitalist property rights. Therefore, the state must take steps to promote capitalist accumulation in the long-term interests of the capitalist class and especially its economically and politically hegemonic fraction. The state behaves like a machine of social reproduction, from the standpoint of the social capital. And ‘[l]ike any other machine, it requires maintenance, amortization, new parts, and a continuous supply of fuel and energy’. So ‘the social capital . . . must set aside a considerable portion of the value it realizes in order to continuously finance state activity’ (Smith, 2018: 234): [L]ike unproductive capital in the sphere of circulation, the state carries out a range of tasks that are indispensable to maintaining the institutional framework of the valorization process. In this sense, it contributes ‘indirectly’ to the production of social surplus-value. (ibid.) By appropriating more surplus labour, the state reduces the overhead costs for social capital. To describe the nature of capitalism, Marx (1887) begins with the formula, M-C-M, which means ‘the transformation of money into commodities, and the change of commodities back again into money; or buying in order to sell. Money that circulates in the latter manner is thereby transformed into, becomes capital, and is already potentially capital’ (p. 104). But given that no one would exchange M for M (100 for 100), Marx says that ‘[t]he exact form of this process [of circulation of commodities] is therefore M-C-M', where M' = M + D M = ‘the original sum advanced, plus an increment’ (ibid.: 106). ‘This increment or excess over the original value’ is called surplus value. ‘It is this movement that converts it into capital’ (ibid.). M-C-M' is actually M-C-P-C'-M', which can be further expanded to M-C (MP+LP)-P-C'-M'. The state is connected to each phase ofthe circuit (Figure 7.1). The capital circuit in its expanded form can serve as a method of systematic presentation as well as a method of analysis of the role of the state. In Sections 1—4, I discuss how the state is connected to the successive phases of the capital circuit. I discuss the state’s role in relation to accumulation in Section 5 (which is connected to the previous section); here I closely follow Marx’s discussion in Chapter 25 in Capital volume 1. In Section 6, I turn to the state’s role in relation to tendencies and counter-tendencies towards economic crisis. In the last section, I summarize the discussion and reflect on the implications of my discussion for the concepts of state capitalism and socialism. 1 The state and the ‘M-C(MP+. . .’ phase of the capital circuit (the sphere of money and means of production) The state makes liquid investible resources (M) available to capitalists (and espe-cially to the big business), often at below-market rates, through various policies (e.g. low-interest loans, quantitative easing, loan waivers or forgiveness and various bailout packages). Some of these policies represent simple plundering of the state treasury. Liberalization of financial markets allows domestic businesses access foreign capital. Often the money received from the state (including by cheap credits) is used by capital to simply speculate rather than to invest to produce goods and services that people need, and in this case the state’s connection to capital circuit is its connection to a shorter version of the circuit: the state helps capitalists increase their profit in the form of interest in the sphere of financialization, so M-C-P-C'-M' is shortened to M-M' (meaning money can simply be made from money, with assistance from the state). For the production process, capitalists need actual commodities, including means of production (raw materials, land, energy, software, machines, the built environment or social and physical infrastructure, and so on). Means of production can exist in a collective form (publicly owned airport or railroads or mines) or in the form of privately owned assets. The state makes commodities available to the capitalist class in the form of cheap raw materials and cheap land, water bodies (lakes), and forests, which have been obtained from people via ongoing primitive accumulation (often the latter process happens in areas inhabited by poverty-stricken indigenous communities). Land is a crucial means of production. It is necessary for locating any enterprise. It is directly necessary in land-based production (e.g. farming, forestry, fishing, eco-tourism, and the like). Capitalists’ access to minerals for extractive industries requires their access to land. If all the land is owned by numerous private owners (including small-scale producers/owners), then assembling a big chunk of land for large-scale enterprises (e.g. laying out major railroads and railways, large-scale factories, and so on) would be a problem, so the state comes to own the land too. As mentioned earlier, the state uses its power to take control over privately owned land by paying a low price — lower than what the price would be when the land is fully developed and an enterprise begins to operate — and then makes this property available to capitalists at a rate suitable to them and sometimes for free. In part because a capitalist wishes to buy as cheap as possible and small-scale owners wish to get a better price, coercion by the state may be necessary to transcend their reluctance to part with their property. Where the state owns forested land or water resources, it also makes these available to private capitalists as and when they need. The state may not always resort to primitive accumulation in the interest of capitalists or the big business. The state can try to make sure that small-scale commodity producers, including small-scale capitalists, produce commodities — as potential raw materials — for sale to the big business at a price suitable to the latter. The state can promote contract farming too (see Shrimali, 2021). The state can weaken its own erstwhile role in trading whereby the state would buy products from small-scale producers as a remunerative price. The state thus makes the small-scale producers depend entirely on private trading capital through which raw materials reach the production process. As discussed earlier, it is the state that creates, or contributes to the production of, the geographically built environment that connects commodity owners located in different places and countries. A hierarchy of market centres (e.g. metros, smaller cities and towns, rural markets) is created including through urban and regional planning by the state that is behind the urbanization and ruralization of capitalist production and exchange. Means of transportation and communication are laid out by the state or with state’s assistance. The state is involved in what David Harvey (1985) calls the production of space. The built environment or the produced space, which includes the means of transportation and communication, can often appear partly or wholly as a form of commodity for which common people have to pay in order to use them. The cost of geographical movement of a commodity is a part of the cost of production, so the state is under pressure to make it available. The value of commodities is thus reduced. The state ‘engages in productive activities particularly with respect to investments in public goods and collective physical infrastructures such as roads, ports and harbours, water and sewage provision’ (Harvey, 2018: 16).2 It helps capital annihilate obstacles to social and geographical mobility.3 The state-aided built environment can increase the rate of profit in the private sector producing heavy goods, and the like, and thus increase its national competitiveness (Mandel, 2008/1968: 502).4 Marx (1973: 531) comments on the role of the state in the production of the physical infrastructure (public works) in Grundrisse: there may be a need for the development of railways, and so on, but specific capitalists may not invest because ‘the direct advantage arising from them for production may be too small for the investment to appear as anything but sunk capital’. So capital shifts the burden on to the shoulders of the state; or, where the state traditionally still takes up a position superior to capital, it still possesses the authority and the will to force the society of capitalists to put a part of their revenue, not of their capital, into such generally useful works, which appear at the same time as general conditions of production, and hence not as particular conditions for one capitalist or another. As science becomes a productive force, the state socializes the cost of science. The state creates conditions for intellectual labour that is more directly connected to production: natural sciences and engineering as well as management (the ‘science’ of organization of capitalist enterprises taught in business schools).5 If the state is involved in technological change, this can reduce the value of labour power by shortening the time taken to produce means of subsistence.”翻译为中文","completion":"在完成商品，包括劳动力的买卖后，资本主义生产（劳动）过程在资本运动规律下开始。这是一个过程，资本家（或其代理人）将生产资料和工人聚集在一起生产用于销售的使用价值：在资本主义下，“劳动过程是资本家购买的、已变成他[或她]的财产的事物之间的过程”（马克思，1887：131）。工作场所，劳动过程的空间，生产的隐蔽处，是剥削阶级某些权利的领域。这些权利由国家捍卫。因此，包括工作场所在内的生产领域揭示了国家的重要属性。正如在最后两章中一样，我部分依赖《资本论》第1卷来展示资本主义社会关系和生产逻辑是如何创造一个空间，并产生国家行动的必要性，无论国家在给定情况下是否采取行动，或者它的行动是否令资本家满意。 在社会中，新的财富（新财富）不能仅仅基于原始积累或甚至阶级分化（前面讨论的主题）来生产。新财富也不能仅基于商品流通来生产：剩余价值（新财富）不能在流通内部产生，尽管它不能在商品流通之外产生。流通本身或商品交换并不创造价值。在流通和创造资本主义财产的基础上，从前资本主义或非资本主义（小规模所有者）财产中，新财富最终在生产的隐藏处内部产生，而在这里国家扮演着重要角色。 资本主义国家是一个经济强大的代理人。事实上，国家支出的社会资本部分不断上升，包括在新自由主义下。国家利用其经济权力（包括创造货币的权力），为资本主义创造那些利润驱动的个体资本家通常不会生产甚至可能破坏的条件。 正如之前所论述的，资本是运动中的价值，因此国家仅仅捍卫资本主义财产权是不够的。因此，国家必须采取措施，从长远来看促进资本主义积累，符合资本家阶级特别是其经济和政治上占主导地位的部分的利益。国家表现得像社会资本的社会再生产机器。正如“任何其他机器一样，它需要维护、折旧、新部件，以及持续的燃料和能源供应”。因此“社会资本... 必须拿出它实现的价值中的相当一部分，以便持续资助国家活动”（史密斯，2018：234）： “就像流通领域中的非生产性资本一样，国家执行一系列对维持增值过程的制度框架不可或缺的任务。从这个意义上说，它‘间接’地为社会剩余价值的生产做出了贡献。” 通过占有更多的剩余劳动，国家降低了社会资本的间接成本。 为了描述资本主义的性质，马克思（1887）从公式M-C-M'开始，表示“将金钱转化为商品，然后再将商品变回金钱；或者买进以便卖出。以后者方式流通的金钱因此转化为，成为资本，并且已经潜在地成为资本”（第104页）。但鉴于没有人会将M换M（100美元换100美元），马克思说“[这个流通的]确切形式因此是M-C-M'”，其中M' = M + ΔM = “预支的原始总和，加上一个增量”（同上：106）。这个“增量或超过原始价值的部分”被称为剩余价值。“正是这种运动将其转变为资本”。 M-C-M'实际上是M-C（MP+LP）-P-C'-M'，可以进一步展开为M-C（MP+LP）-P-C'-M'。国家与资本循环的每个阶段都有联系（图7.1）。资本循环的扩展形式可以作为系统呈现的方法，也可以作为分析国家角色的方法。 在第1-4节中，我讨论了国家与资本循环的连续阶段之间的联系。我在第5节（与前一节相关）讨论了国家与积累的关系；在这里我紧密跟随马克思在《资本论》第1卷第25章的讨论。在第6节，我转向国家与经济危机的趋势和反趋势的关系。在最后一节中，我总结了讨论，并反思了我的讨论对国家资本主义和社会主义概念的影响。 1 国家与资本循环的‘M-C（MP+...’阶段（货币和生产资料的领域） 国家通过各种政策（例如低利率贷款、量化宽松、贷款豁免或宽恕和各种纾困计划）向资本家（尤其是大企业）提供流动可投资资源（M），通常低于市场利率。这些政策中的一些代表了对国家财库的简单掠夺。金融市场的自由化使国内企业能够获得外国资本。通常从国家获得的资金（包括通过廉价信贷）被资本用于简单的投机而不是投资于生产人们需要的商品和服务，在这种情况下，国家与资本循环的联系是其与更短版本的循环的联系：国家帮助资本家以金融化领域的利息形式增加其利润，因此M-C-P-C'-M'简化为M-M'（意味着在国家的帮助下，金钱简单地从金钱中产生）。 对于生产过程，资本家需要实际的商品，包括生产资料（原材料、土地、能源、软件、机器、建成环境或社会和物理基础设施等）。生产资料可以以集体形式存在（公共拥有的机场或铁路或矿山）或以私人拥有的资产形式存在。 国家以廉价原材料和廉价土地、水体（湖泊）和森林的形式向资本家阶级提供商品，这些是通过持续的原始积累从人们那里获得的（后者过程通常发生在贫困的原住民社区居住的地区）。土地是关键的生产资料。对于任何企业的定位来说，它是必要的。在以土地为基础的生产中（例如农业、林业、渔业、生态旅游等）直接必要。资本家获得矿产资源以用于开采行业需要他们获得土地的途径。如果所有土地都由众多私人所有者（包括小规模生产者/所有者）拥有，那么为大型企业（例如铺设主要铁路和铁路、大型工厂等）组装一大块土地将是一个问题，因此国家也要拥有土地。正如前面提到的，国家利用其权力以低于土地完全开发和企业开始运营时的价格——低价控制私人拥有的土地——然后以适合资本家的价格，有时免费将这些财产提供给资本家。部分是因为资本家希望尽可能廉价购买而小规模所有者希望获得更好的价格，可能需要国家的强制手段来克服他们不愿放弃财产的犹豫。当国家拥有森林土地或水资源时，它也会根据需要将这些资源提供给私人资本家。 国家可能不总是为了资本家或大企业的利益而诉诸原始积累。国家可以试图确保小规模商品生产者，包括小规模资本家，生产商品——作为潜在原材料——以适合后者的价格出售给大企业。国家也可以促进契约农业（参见Shrimali，2021）。国家可以削弱自己在贸易中曾经的角色，国家会以有利的价格从小规模生产者那里购买产品。国家因此使小规模生产者完全依赖私人贸易资本，通过这种方式原材料到达生产过程。 正如之前讨论的，国家创造或促进了连接不同地方和国家的商品所有者的地理环境建设。通过国家的城市和区域规划，包括资本主义生产和交易的城市化和乡村化背后，创造了市场中心等级制度（例如大都市、较小城市和城镇、农村市场）。国家或在国家的协助下铺设了交通和通讯手段。国家参与了大卫·哈维（1985）所称的空间生产。建成环境或生产的空间，包括交通和通讯手段，常常部分或全部作为商品出现，普通人为使用它们而付费。商品地理移动的成本是生产成本的一部分，因此国家承受着使其提供的压力。因此商品的价值得以降低。国家“特别是在公共物品和集体物理基础设施（如道路、港口和码头、供水和排污）的投资方面从事生产活动”（哈维，2018：16）。它帮助资本消除了社会和地理流动性的障碍。国家协助建设的环境可以提高私营部门生产重型商品的利润率，从而提高其国家竞争力（曼德尔，2008/1968：502）。马克思（1973：531）在《Grundrisse》中评论了国家在物理基础设施（公共工程）生产中的角色：可能需要发展铁路等，但具体的资本家可能不投资，因为“对生产的直接优势可能太小，以至于投资似乎不过是沉没资本”。因此资本将负担转嫁给国家；或者，如果国家在传统上仍然占据着高于资本的位置，它仍然拥有权威和意愿强迫资本家社会投入他们的部分收入，而不是他们的资本，进入这种普遍有用的工程，这些工程同时出现作为生产的一般条件，因而不是作为这个或那个资本家的特殊条件。 随着科学成为生产力，国家使科学成本社会化。国家为与生产更直接相关的智力劳动创造条件：自然科学和工程学以及管理（在商学院教授的资本企业组织的“科学”）。如果国家参与技术变革，这可以通过缩短生产生存手段所需的时间来降低劳动力价值。"},{"prompt":"请将“Anything that the state can do to reduce the costs of discovery of, for example, minerals will affect their value. The state spends money on research and development (R&D) in the public (including in the military sector), the results of which are enjoyed by the private sector (ibid.: 555).6 As widely known, it was government research that created the internet from which all the companies could make money. In other words, R&D is socialized while its benefits are privatized. In fact, as productivity rises, there is a tendency for more circulating capital to be converted into fixed capital which is invested in things that (unlike ‘the machinery directly active in the direct production process’) do not impact production immediately: ‘railways, canals, aqueducts, telegraphs etc.’ (Mandel, 1978: 484). As technical change becomes increasingly crucial to capitalism, and as investment in technology is expensive, the state shares responsibility for some of the costs of capital accumulation projects (ibid.). The value of a commodity in capitalism = c + v + s. When the nationalized industry supplies a commodity to the private sector at a price that equals constant capital and variable capital (and not the surplus value that is extracted from worker), it is tantamount to the private sector receiving a free surplus value (Mandel, 1978: 554). This can increase the rate of profit in the private sector, other things constant. As already indicated, there are different juridical ways in which the state makes available the means of production to capital for private sector accumulation (Figure 7.2). The state makes small-scale producers sell the raw materials (e.g. agri-products) at a cheaper rate to big business. Or the state buys from them raw materials and other resources at a cheap rate and makes them available to big business. It also provides means of production and transportation facilities through state-owned enterprises (railways, heavy industries), which is a concealed method of subsidizing the private capitalist sector. Nationalization of industries, especially in natural resources and in infrastructure — some of which could be unprofitable for the private sector at the initial stage of capitalist development — can provide means of production to the private sector such as power and transportation, and the like at reduced cost. The state also resorts to the opposite process: it turns over the commons, including erstwhile state-owned enterprises or state-owned natural resources, to the private hands at a low price. For example, where necessary, the state resorts to the reprivatization of erstwhile nationalized companies and establishments (e.g. museums, monuments) at a throw-away price which puts an enormous amount of assets at a low cost in the hands of the capitalist class. This represents unequal exchange reminiscent of colonial times. Through the liberalization of trade, the state makes foreign commodities available as intermediate goods. The state also makes use of market mechanisms. One is PPP (public private partnership). The latter is a sweet name for the state openly subsidizing the private sector. Another is outsourcing whereby state-provided use-value is actually produced by a private company. While the capitalist class as a whole may not have an interest in building the built environment which all of its members need but cannot produce for their own benefit only, sections of the capitalist can make profit by building it on behalf of the state which acts on behalf of the capitalist class as a whole. By facilitating the provision of credit, the state allows concentration and centralization (of financial resources), without which infrastructural conditions such as railways requiring bulky investment would be difficult. The state sometimes gets the private companies to build infrastructure (e.g. railways) by guaranteeing a certain rate of profit (this happened in colonial India, for example). 2 The state and the ‘C ( . . . + LP)’ phase of capital circuit (the sphere of labour power) A special type of commodity that capitalists, whether bigger or smaller, need in the production process is labour power. The state’s relation to commodity labour power has been discussed in a previous chapter, so a few points only may be recapitulated here. Mainly by using the tax money from workers themselves, the state can collec-tivize a part of the value of labour power and provide subsidized education and healthcare. With state-funded commons (e.g. government-provided/-subsidized education and healthcare), the value of labour power — the value of necessaries in commodified forms that workers receive from private employers — can fall, and other things constant. This can increase the rate of exploitation.7 Also certain kinds of commons — education — might make workers more productive, so more surplus value may be appropriated in its relative form. State investment in education and workforce retraining to produce a skilled workforce can benefit capital investment in high skills and high-wage industries in specific regions. Facilitating the use of vulnerable groups of workers, and especially child labour and immigrants, is a method of ensuring low-cost labour. The owner of this special commodity can, of course, bargain for its price, but the state seeks to reduce its bargaining power in many ways: increasing the ease at which capital can hire and fire labour and resorting to identity politics to divide potential or actual organization of workers. The state sets the minimum wage at a very low level which has an adverse effect on workers’ bargaining power and on the actual wages paid by private capital. In addition, the minimum wage laws tend not to be implemented seriously. When the state makes available a given amount of means of subsistence as a part of its poverty-alleviation programme, it can potentially increase the bargaining power of workers by weakening their reliance on employers. But by defining the poverty level at a low level in order to restrict the number of eligible recipients of state assistance, the state reduces the total amount of assistance, thus minimizing any potentially positive impact of state’s social policy not only on workers’ economic condition but also on their political bargaining power. The non-implementation of a living wage and non-provision of a safety net — in a context where there is a massive and growing reserve army to which dispossession under neoliberalism contributes — drives wages below the cost of maintenance (i.e. the value of labour power). Further, the state, including the courts, suppresses the right to strike, including in the name of inviting foreign capital, as well as the right to work,8 economic development, employment generation, and so on. 3 The state and the ‘P’ phase of capital circuit (the sphere of commodity production) The main aim of capitalists is to increase their profit by reducing the cost of production, so what happens inside ‘the hidden abode of production’ (Marx, 1887: 123) crucially matters. The internal relation between capital and the state is forcefully expressed in the hidden abode of production. Apart from making available certain general conditions for production and exchange (built environment, natural resources, raw materials, scientific knowledge, and the like), the state defends the capitalist nature of labour process and capitalist exploitation. The sphere of production is a sphere of the political battle between capital and labour, one where capital exercises its despotic control (ibid.: 231—2). So all the interventions by the state aimed at reducing the bargaining power in the labour market also reduce workers’ power on the shop floor. Ensuring that private property rights are in place, the state has to support capitalist labour process. The capitalist ‘has bought the use of the labour-power for a definite period, and he insists upon his rights. He has no intention of being robbed’ (Marx, 1887: 137). In capitalism, money is converted into capital ‘in the most exact accordance with the economic laws of commodity production and with the right of property derived from them’ (ibid.: 413). This right is defended by the state.9 The product of labour ‘is the property of the capitalist and not that of the labourer, its immediate producer’, ‘just as much as does the wine which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar’ (Marx, 1887: 131). The state defends the capitalists’ property right in the workplace. At best, as far as the state is concerned, the worker retains his or her labour power and can sell it anew if they can find a buyer. Under capitalism, even if there is equal exchange (all commodities, including labour power, are paid at their value), ‘the laws of appropriation or of private property, laws that are based on the production and circulation of commodities, become by their own inner and inexorable dialectic changed into their very opposite’, that is, opposite of equal exchange (p. 412). This is for two reasons. Firstly, ‘the capital which is exchanged for labour-power (as a commodity) is itself but a portion of the product of others’ labour appropriated without an equivalent’ (ibid.). Secondly, ‘this capital must not only be replaced by its producer, but replaced together with an added surplus’ (ibid.). In other words, ‘what really takes place’ between capitalists and workers is that ‘the capitalist again and again appropriates, without equivalent, a portion of the previously materialised labour of others, and exchanges it for a greater quantity of living labour’ (ibid.; italics added). This economic law of capitalist exploitation — like the law of equal exchange between commodity sellers — is codified and defended by the laws of the capitalist state. If a worker is paid the full value of the things that the worker and their family need to live, and if society takes 3 hours to produce all those things, the state has to make sure that the worker works longer than those 3 hours, that the worker works, say, 8 hours, producing surplus value for capital. By maintaining the class status of the vast majority as workers, with little or no access to means of production, and of the minority as capitalists who monopolize the means of production, the state makes sure that workers surrender a large part of what they produce to the capitalists. So, in capitalism, ‘property turns out to be the right, on the part of the capitalist, to appropriate the unpaid labour of others or its product, and to be the impossibility, on the part of the labourer, of appropriating his own product’ (Marx, 1887: 412; italics added). And this sort of property right, the capitalist property right, must be coercively defended because between the right of the capitalist to the unpaid labour of the worker and the right of the worker to have full control over the entire product of their labour, between these two fundamental class interests, there is no compatibility. This incompatibility is indicated by ‘the impossibility, on the part of the labourer, of appropriating his own product’ (p. 412). The state function cannot but be shaped by this characteristic of capitalism. If the worker leaves the workplace after 3 hours, the state will consider that illegal. The state has to ensure that ‘the value of this product includes, besides the value of the capital advanced, a surplus-value which costs the worker labour but the capitalist nothing, and which none the less becomes the legitimate property of the capitalist’ (p. 413).”翻译为中文","completion":"国家可以通过减少发现矿物等的成本来影响它们的价值。国家在公共部门（包括军事领域）投资研发（R&D），其成果被私营部门享用（同上：555）。众所周知，正是政府研究创造了互联网，所有公司都可以从中赚钱。换句话说，R&D被社会化而其益处被私有化。 实际上，随着生产率的提高，更多的流动资本被转化为固定资本，这些固定资本被投资于不立即影响生产的事物（与“直接参与直接生产过程的机械”不同）：“铁路、运河、水渠、电报等”（曼德尔，1978：484）。随着技术变革对资本主义日益重要，且技术投资昂贵，国家分担一部分资本积累项目的成本（同上）。 资本主义中的商品价值 = c + v + s。当国有产业以等于固定资本和流动资本的价格向私营部门提供商品（并非从工人那里提取的剩余价值）时，这相当于私营部门获得了免费的剩余价值（曼德尔，1978：554）。这可以在其他条件不变的情况下增加私营部门的利润率。 正如已经指出的，国家通过不同的法律方式使生产资料对资本可用于私营部门积累（图7.2）。国家使小规模生产者以更便宜的价格向大企业出售原材料（例如农产品）。或国家以低价从他们那里购买原材料和其他资源，并使其可供大企业使用。它还通过国有企业（铁路、重工业）提供生产资料和运输设施，这是补贴私营资本部门的隐蔽方法。国有化产业，特别是在自然资源和基础设施领域——其中一些对私营部门在资本主义发展的初始阶段可能无利可图——可以向私营部门提供生产资料，如电力和运输等，以降低成本。国家还采取相反的过程：以低价格将公共资源，包括以前的国有企业或国有自然资源，转移到私人手中。例如，在必要时，国家诉诸于将以前国有化的公司和机构（如博物馆、纪念碑）以廉价价格重新私有化，这使得大量资产以低成本落入资本家阶级手中。这代表了殖民时期的不平等交换。通过贸易自由化，国家使外国商品作为中间商品可用。 国家还利用市场机制。其中之一是PPP（公私合作伙伴关系）。后者是国家公开补贴私营部门的美好名称。另一个是外包，其中国家提供的使用价值实际上由私人公司生产。虽然作为整体的资本家阶级可能对建设所有成员都需要但不能仅为自己的利益而生产的建成环境不感兴趣，资本家的某些部分可以代表国家建设它，国家代表整个资本家阶级行事。通过促进信贷提供，国家允许集中和中央化（金融资源），如果没有这些，如铁路所需的大规模投资等基础设施条件将是困难的。国家有时让私人公司建设基础设施（例如铁路），通过保证一定的利润率（例如在殖民时期的印度发生的情况）。 2 国家与资本循环的‘C（...+LP）’阶段（劳动力的领域） 资本家在生产过程中需要的一种特殊类型的商品是劳动力。国家与商品劳动力的关系已在前一章讨论，因此这里只需重申几点。 主要通过使用工人自己的税收，国家可以集体化劳动力价值的一部分，并提供补贴的教育和医疗保健。通过国家资助的公共产品（例如政府提供/补贴的教育和医疗保健），劳动力的价值——工人从私人雇主那里获得的以商品化形式出现的必需品的价值——可以下降，其他条件不变。这可以增加剥削率。另外某些类型的公共产品——教育——可能使工人更有生产力，因此可以以相对形式占有更多的剩余价值。国家对教育和劳动力再培训的投资以培养技能劳动力，可以使特定地区的高技能和高薪行业的资本投资受益。 利用弱势工人群体，尤其是童工和移民，是确保低成本劳动力的方法。这种特殊商品的所有者当然可以为其价格讨价还价，但国家以多种方式寻求减少其讨价还价的能力：增加资本雇佣和解雇劳动力的便利性，并诉诸身份政治来分裂潜在或实际的工人组织。国家将最低工资设定在非常低的水平，这对工人的讨价还价能力和私人资本实际支付的工资产生不利影响。此外，最低工资法往往不会被严肃实施。 当国家将一定量的生存手段作为其扶贫计划的一部分提供时，它可以通过削弱工人对雇主的依赖来潜在增加工人的讨价还价能力。但通过将贫困水平定义在较低水平以限制符合国家援助资格的受助人数量，国家减少了总体援助量，从而最小化了国家社会政策对工人经济状况以及政治讨价还价能力的任何潜在积极影响。不实施生活工资和不提供安全网——在新自由主义下贫困人口大量增长的背景下——将工资推低至维持成本以下（即劳动力价值）。此外，国家，包括法院，压制罢工权，包括以吸引外资、就业发展、就业创造等名义。 3 国家与资本循环的‘P’阶段（商品生产的领域） 资本家的主要目标是通过降低生产成本来增加其利润，因此“生产的隐蔽处”（马克思，1887：123）内部发生的事情至关重要。资本与国家之间的内在关系在生产的隐蔽处有力表达。除了提供某些生产和交换的一般条件（建成环境、自然资源、原材料、科学知识等）外，国家捍卫资本主义劳动过程和资本主义剥削的性质。生产领域是资本与劳动之间政治斗争的领域，资本在其中行使其专制控制（同上：231-2）。因此，国家旨在降低劳动力市场上讨价还价能力的所有干预也减少了工人在车间的力量。 确保私有财产权到位，国家必须支持资本主义劳动过程。资本家“已经购买了一定期限的劳动力使用权，并坚持自己的权利。他无意被抢劫”（马克思，1887：137）。在资本主义中，金钱转化为资本“完全符合商品生产的经济法则及由其衍生的财产权”（同上：413）。这一权利由国家捍卫。 劳动的产物“是资本家的财产而不是劳动者——它的直接生产者的财产”，“就像他地窖里完成的发酵过程的产物——酒一样”（马克思，1887：131）。国家捍卫资本家在工作场所的财产权。就国家而言，工人最多保留他或她的劳动力，并可以将其重新出售，如果他们能找到买家。 在资本主义中，即使存在平等交换（包括劳动力在内的所有商品都按其价值支付），“私有财产的法则或私有财产的法律，这些法律基于商品的生产和流通，通过它们自身的内在和不可避免的辩证法变成了与之完全相反的东西”，即平等交换的反面（第412页）。这有两个原因。首先，“用于交换劳动力（作为一种商品）的资本本身只是未通过等价物占有的他人劳动的产物的一部分”（同上）。其次，“这些资本不仅必须被其生产者替代，还必须连同一个附加的剩余一起被替代”（同上）。换句话说，“实际发生的”是资本家和工人之间，“资本家一次又一次地占有他人以前物质化的劳动的一部分，而没有等价物，并将其交换为更多的活劳动”（同上；斜体字为原文添加）。 这一资本主义剥削的经济法则——就像商品卖家之间的平等交换法则一样——被资本主义国家的法律编纂并捍卫。如果工人获得了工人及其家庭生活所需物品的全部价值，如果社会花费3小时生产所有这些东西，国家必须确保工人工作的时间超过这3小时，即工人工作，比如说，8小时，为资本生产剩余价值。通过保持绝大多数人作为工人的阶级地位，几乎没有或没有进入生产手段的途径，而少数人作为垄断生产手段的资本家，国家确保工人将他们生产的大部分交给资本家。因此，在资本主义中，“财产变成了资本家占有他人未付劳动或其产物的权利，以及劳动者无法占有自己产物的不可能性的权利”（马克思，1887：412；斜体字为原文添加）。这种财产权，资本主义的财产权，必须强制捍卫，因为资本家对工人未付劳动的权利与工人对自己劳动全部产物的控制权之间，这两个基本阶级利益之间不存在兼容性。这种不兼容性由“劳动者无法占有自己产物的不可能性”（第412页）所表明。国家功能必然受到这一资本主义特征的影响。如果工人在3小时后离开工作场所，国家将视为非法。国家必须确保“这一产品的价值，除了预支的资本价值外，还包括一个剩余价值，这个剩余价值需要工人的劳动但对资本家来说却毫无代价，尽管如此，它仍然成为资本家的合法财产”（第413页）。"},{"prompt":"请将“In capitalism, product and labour power are commodities, but they are different types of commodity. Those who sell their labour power do not have the right to sell the products of their labour. If at the end of a day’s labour, workers in a factory producing cell phones decide to sell all the phones they have made and share the profit — or most of it — among themselves, then the police will be at the door of the workplace and act against the worker. If people receive only a part of the net product they produce under the control of capitalists, it is not injustice. But it is not injustice if and only if we accept the law of commodity exchange: labour power has been paid at its value, and therefore its use-value — what the capitalist, the buyer, makes of it — depends entirely on the capitalist. The state accepts this: capitalist exploitation is not necessarily unjust: The circumstance, that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labourpower costs only half a day’s labour, while on the other hand the very same labour-power can work during a whole day . . . is, without doubt, a piece of good luck for the buyer’ however, it is ‘by no means an injury [injustice] to the seller. (Marx, 1887: 136) Acting in the interest of the majority, the state, given its coercive power, could make sure that there is no exploitation in the workplace: that is, ‘the [labour] process be not carried beyond the point, where the value paid by the capitalist for the labour-power is replaced by an exact equivalent’ (ibid.: 137) and a little more in order to pay for the things society needs (all the deductions from the social product that will be necessary in a society beyond capital). But the state will not do this. On the contrary, it must juridically support the fact that the labour process ‘be continued beyond that point’ in order to become ‘a process of creating surplus-value’ (ibid.). ‘The fact that half a day’s labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours, does not in any way prevent him [or her] from working a whole day’ (Marx, 1887: 135). The state defends this difference in time — that is, the difference between the time taken to produce the necessaries that people need and the time they spend in the workplace as workers, or the difference between what they get and what they make. Everything in the social world exists as a product of human labour interacting with nature. The capitalist form of the wealth (value) is entirely a product of wage labour. Capitalists control property, so the world we live in appears to be one that has been created by capital in its own image, as per the logic of capitalist production. But, in actuality, this world is the world of ordinary people, the people who actually do the work (mostly as wage labour but also as small-scale producers). The world we live in is the world created by people’s necessary labour (that is reflected in their consumption of necessaries) and by their surplus labour. The state does everything to suppress the people’s image of the world and to prop up the capitalist image. This is evident when state policies are expected to not harm capitalists and also when capitalists are seen as employers or jobs providers, investors, and wealth creators. Underlying this view is the capitalist image: that they actually do something and are indispensable to people’s lives. Marx says that ‘[a]s soon as his labour actually begins, it has already ceased to belong to him; it can therefore no longer be sold by him’ (Marx, 1887: 379). This happens in spite of the fact that everything he/she works on or with (e.g. raw materials, machines, software, and so on) has been produced by him. Even wages that the workers receive are paid from the money that the capitalist obtains by selling the products that the workers have earlier produced. One can imagine a normal rate/process of exploitation in a society that an average worker is subjected to.10 Apart from this, there are excesses that the capitalists inflict on workers: this is by lowering the wages below the average cost of maintenance of workers,11 cutting down on spending for workplace safety (e.g. protective equipment during a pandemic, enough working space per worker, safety of chemicals),12 and so on. Under some circumstances, the state can intervene, and it has intervened, to curb these excesses. But often it does much less than what workers need, given the ‘limits’ that capitalism ‘imposes’ (discussed later). What is crucial to recognize is how the state sees exploitation. The normal process of exploitation is not what exploitation is in the eyes of the state; only the excesses of the capitalist system constitute exploitation. In the normal discourse, including that produced by most academics and other commentators on capitalism, which the state makes use of, exploitation happens when an employer uses a person’s labour power by force and/or without a payment (or with a payment below the state-mandated minimum wage).13 Even ILO (n.d.) has a grossly inadequate view about exploitation, as demonstrated in own document titled the ‘Details of indicators of labour exploitation’. Workers’ organizations also hold a similar view: this is influenced by the state and is legalistic. It is as if the state creates and defines capitalist exploitation.14 The view of exploitation that is held, and acted on, by the state (and state-like institutions) does little to combat — let alone — eliminate — exploitation proper. Reducing the normal to the non-normal (the excess), the state protects the normal by virtue of which the non-normal forms of exploitation happen. Capitalism is a free society relative to pre-capitalism. Unlike in pre-capitalist societies, no one can generally force a person to sell her/his labour power to this and that capitalist. After men and women have sold their labour power, and once they enter the workplace, they have, however, very little freedom, including over their own body. They play no role in decision-making with regard to production and accumulation. In the capitalist workplace, the worker works under the control of the capitalist, and the product of labour belongs to the capitalist. This is how the labour process in general — one that is common to all societies — becomes capitalist labour process. The state codifies and defends the capitalist right to control the work of the worker: state action is necessary because such right of the capitalist to control the workplace is against the need and desire of the worker to perform free labour. ‘The bargain concluded, it is discovered that he was no “free agent,” that the time for which he is free to sell his labour-power is the time for which he is forced to sell it’. And this unfreedom is juridically justified and codified by the state. Without the state, as the realm of unfreedom, unfreedom of labour cannot exist. In the workplace, control over workers is necessary to pre-emptively eliminate or reduce chances of resistance by workers: ‘As the number of the cooperating labourers increases, so too does their resistance to the domination of capital, and with it, the necessity for capital to overcome this resistance by counterpressure’ (Marx, 1887: 231). Thus, the people who do ‘the work of directing, superintending, and adjusting’ as agents of capital engage in despotic control over labourers subjecting them to oppressive power relations in order to increase exploitation and overcome resistance to that exploitation. Here unequal race/ethnic and gender relations between ordinary workers and managers further reinforce the despotic control of capital. The despotic control happens in the workplaces in general and those in so-called special economic zones (or ‘special exploitation zones’), with the support of the state, which represents the society-wide concentration of political power of the exploiting classes.15 The unfreedom of labour within the workplace, defended by the state, is every bit extra-economic. Marx’s concept of ‘despotic control’ points to that. Thus, workers are not free to take control of the product they collectively produce in the workplace. To enforce this unfreedom and to make workers produce more surplus value, capitalism resorts to a form of unfreedom, which consists of the political control by capitalists over workers in the workplace. There are two major ways in which capital can increase the rate of exploitation (the ratio of surplus product to necessary product) if we assume that wages cover the value of labour power (the topic of wages falling below the value of labour power and state’s complicit in it has been discussed in an earlier chapter). One is technical change that raises labour productivity and makes workers produce more every hour. Here the state helps by supporting technical change including its funding for research and development, higher education, and so on. The other method is where some capitalists mainly rely on workers working long hours (for low hourly wages); capitalists are directly affected if, for example, their access to cheaper labour is restricted by the state. Other things constant, the longer the working day, the higher the profits. This relation is particularly strong in capitalism’s infancy, given the absence of productivity-raising technology.16 Acting on behalf of capital, the state forces workers to work long hours.17 The capitalist ‘can, under the pretense of paying “the normal price of labour,” abnormally lengthens the working-day without any corresponding compensation to the labourer’ (Marx, 1887: 385); ‘the bourgeoisie, at its rise, wants and uses the power of the state . . . to lengthen the working-day’ (p. 523). It lengthened the working day by compulsion (p. 181). Even when during an economic crisis, production is interrupted and enterprises work only a part of the week, the working day is not necessarily shortened. Capitalists may have an incentive to increase working day: ‘The less business there is, the more profit has to be made on the business done. The less time spent in work, the more of that time has to be turned into surplus labourtime’ (Marx, 1887: 167). The state allows this.18 There are several reasons why workers are made to work long hours. For one, ‘the capitalist has bought the labour-power at its day-rate. To him its use-value belongs during one working-day. He has thus acquired the [state- defended] right to make the labourer work for him during one day’ (Marx, 1887: 163). From capital’s angle, the ‘spontaneous’ operation of the laws of capitalist commodity relations imposes no limit to the length of the working day. From the opposite angle, that is, from labour’s angle, matters are different: what might begin as equal exchange ends up being unequal. If a worker works excessively long hours (say, 15 hours a day) and if due to overwork, her longevity is reduced by, say, 20%, her total wage income during her working life is not increased by 20%: she still gets the wages as if she is going to live a life of normal longevity. In other words, the law of equal exchange supported by the state is violated on the basis of equal exchange, which is also supported by the state. Marx says, ‘[T]he nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working day, no limit to surplus labour’ which allows the capitalist to maintain ‘his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible’. Acting in their own interest, on the other hand, ‘the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite normal duration’. So ‘[t]here is here . . . an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides’ (Marx, 1887: 163—4). And this is ultimately the force of the capitalist state. The state often supports the longer working days.”翻译为中文","completion":"在资本主义中，产品和劳动力是商品，但它们是不同类型的商品。出售劳动力的人没有权利出售他们劳动的产品。如果在一天劳动结束时，一家生产手机的工厂的工人决定出售他们生产的所有手机，并在他们自己之间分享利润——或者大部分利润——那么警察将会出现在工作场所的门口，并对工人采取行动。 如果人们在资本家的控制下只获得他们生产的净产品的一部分，这并不是不公正。但只有在我们接受商品交换法则时，它才不是不公正：劳动力以其价值被支付，因此其使用价值——资本家，买家，对其所做的一切——完全取决于资本家。国家接受这一点：资本家剥削并不一定是不公正的： “一方面，维持劳动力需要的日常营养只需要半天的劳动，而另一方面，完全相同的劳动力可以工作一整天……无疑，这对买家来说是一件好事’，但这‘绝不是对卖家的伤害[不公正]。 （马克思，1887：136） 代表多数人利益行事的国家，鉴于其强制力量，本可以确保工作场所没有剥削：即，‘[劳动]过程不超过这个点，即资本家为劳动力支付的价值被准确等值替代’（同上：137）以及稍微多一点，以支付社会需求的东西（在资本之外的社会中将需要从社会产品中扣除的所有内容）。但国家不会这样做。相反，它必须在法律上支持劳动过程“继续超过这个点”，以便变成“创造剩余价值的过程”（同上）。'半天的劳动是必要的，以维持劳动者24小时的生存，这绝不妨碍他[或她]工作一整天'（马克思，1887：135）。国家捍卫这种时间上的差异——即，生产人们需要的必需品所需的时间与他们作为工人在工作场所度过的时间之间的差异，或者他们得到的与他们制造的之间的差异。 社会世界中的一切存在都是人类劳动与自然相互作用的产物。资本主义形式的财富（价值）完全是工资劳动的产物。资本家控制财产，因此我们所生活的世界似乎是按照资本主义生产逻辑以资本自身形象创造的。但实际上，这个世界是普通人的世界，这些实际从事工作的人（大多作为工资劳动，也有一部分作为小规模生产者）。我们所生活的世界是人们通过必要劳动（反映在他们的必需品消费中）和剩余劳动创造的世界。国家做了一切事情来压制人们对世界的想象，并支持资本主义的形象。当国家政策被期望不损害资本家，以及当资本家被视为雇主或就业提供者、投资者和财富创造者时，这一点变得显而易见。这种观点的背后是资本主义的形象：他们实际上做了一些事情，对人们的生活是不可或缺的。 马克思说，“一旦他的劳动实际开始，它就已不再属于他；因此他不能再出售它了”（马克思，1887：379）。这种情况发生，尽管他/她所使用的一切（例如原材料、机器、软件等）都是由他自己生产的。即使是工人收到的工资也是用资本家通过出售工人之前生产的产品所获得的金钱支付的。 我们可以想象一个社会中平均工人所受到的正常剥削率/过程。除此之外，资本家还对工人造成额外的伤害：这是通过将工资降低到工人维持成本的平均水平以下，削减工作场所安全支出（例如大流行期间的防护装备，每位工人的足够工作空间，化学品的安全性）等。在某些情况下，国家可以干预，并且已经干预，以遏制这些过度行为。但通常它做得远远少于工人的需求，鉴于资本主义\\"强加\\"的\\"限制\\"（稍后讨论）。 关键是要认识到国家是如何看待剥削的。正常的剥削过程并不是国家眼中的剥削；只有资本主义体系的过度行为才构成剥削。在正常的话语中，包括大多数学者和其他评论员对资本主义的讨论，国家利用的那些，剥削发生在雇主强迫使用一个人的劳动力并且/或不付报酬（或付给低于国家规定的最低工资）。即使国际劳工组织（ILO）对剥削也有一个严重不足的观点，正如其名为《劳动剥削指标细节》的文件中所示。工人组织也持有类似的观点：这受到国家的影响并且是法律化的。好像国家创造并定义了资本主义剥削。国家（和类似国家机构）持有的和采取行动的剥削观点，对于抗击——更不用说——消除——适当的剥削几乎没有帮助。通过将正常情况简化为非正常（过度）情况，国家保护了正常情况，由此非正常形式的剥削发生。 资本主义是一个相对于前资本主义更自由的社会。不同于前资本主义社会，一般没有人可以强迫一个人将她/他的劳动力出售给这个或那个资本家。在男性和女性出售了他们的劳动力，并且一旦他们进入工作场所后，他们具有的自由非常有限，包括对自己身体的控制。他们在生产和积累的决策中没有任何作用。在资本主义的工作场所，工人在资本家的控制下工作，劳动的产物属于资本家。这就是劳动过程一般—对所有社会都共有的劳动过程—如何变成资本主义劳动过程。 国家编纂并捍卫资本家控制工人工作的权利：国家的行动是必要的，因为资本家控制工作场所的权利与工人进行自由劳动的需求和愿望相违背。“交易完成后，发现他不是一个‘自由代理人’，他有权出售自己的劳动力的时间是他被迫出售它的时间”。这种不自由在法律上是合理的，并被国家编纂。没有作为不自由领域的国家，劳动的不自由就无法存在。 在工作场所，对工人的控制是必要的，以预先消除或减少工人抵抗的可能性：“随着合作劳动者数量的增加，他们对资本统治的抵抗也随之增加，以及资本克服这种抵抗的必要性也随之加大，需要通过反压力来克服”（马克思，1887：231）。因此，作为资本代理人从事“指导、监督和调整”工作的人，在加强对劳动者的专制控制时，使他们受到压迫性权力关系的制约，以增加剥削并克服对那种剥削的抵抗。在这里，普通工人与管理者之间不平等的种族/民族和性别关系进一步加强了资本的专制控制。在所谓的特殊经济区（或“特殊剥削区”）一般和特定的工作场所中，以国家的支持发生的专制控制，代表了剥削阶级在社会范围内政治权力的集中。工人在工作场所内的不自由，由国家捍卫，是完全超经济的。马克思的“专制控制”的概念指向了这一点。因此，工人无法自由地控制他们在工作场所共同生产的产品。为了强制工人产生更多的剩余价值，资本主义诉诸于一种不自由形式，即资本家在工作场所对工人的政治控制。 如果我们假设工资覆盖了劳动力的价值（工资低于劳动力价值及国家对此的共谋已在前一章讨论），资本可以增加剥削率（剩余产品与必要产品的比率）的两个主要方式有两种。一种是通过提高劳动生产率和使工人每小时生产更多来实现技术变革。在这里，国家通过支持技术变革包括为研发、高等教育等提供资金来提供帮助。另一种方法是一些资本家主要依赖于工人长时间工作（低时薪）；例如，如果国家限制了对廉价劳动力的获取，资本家将直接受到影响。 其他条件不变，工作日越长，利润越高。鉴于缺乏提高生产率的技术，在资本主义的初期，这种关系特别强烈。代表资本行动的国家迫使工人长时间工作。资本家“可以借口支付‘劳动的正常价格’，异常地延长工作日而不给劳动者相应的补偿”（马克思，1887：385）；“资产阶级在其兴起时，需要并使用国家的力量... 以延长工作日”（第523页）。通过强制延长了工作日（第181页）。 即使在经济危机期间，生产中断并且企业只在一周的部分时间工作时，工作日也不一定缩短。资本家可能有动机增加工作日：“业务越少，业务所做的利润就必须越多。工作时间越少，这段时间就必须转化为更多的剩余劳动时间”（马克思，1887：167）。国家允许这样做。"},{"prompt":"请将“There are several reasons why workers are made to work long hours.

So ‘[t]here is here . . . an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides’ (Marx, 1887: 163—4). And this is ultimately the force of the capitalist state. The state often supports the longer working days. Long working days as well as unhealthy working conditions, job insecurity, irregular or unpredictable work hours, and the like lead to various physical and mental illnesses.19 Capitalism is literally killing people now as it did in Marx’s time.20 ‘Capital cares nothing for the length of life of labour-power.’ It shortens ‘the extent of the labourer’s life, as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from the soil by robbing it of its fertility’ (Marx, 1887: 179). Sufferings of workers inflicted by capital are contemptibly ‘necessary conditions to the existence of capital’ (p. 316). The law of uneven development mediates in the way the state responds to the long working days. If capital subjects workers to excessive overwork and endangering health and cause people to die prematurely in one region/ country, it can obtain fresh sources of labour from other regions/countries, especially those where capitalist development is at a lower level (e.g. rural areas or LDCs) so the degeneration of the workers in the former region is kept within limits: ‘the degeneration of the industrial population is only retarded by the constant absorption of primitive and physically uncorrupted elements from the country’ (Marx, 1887: 181). The state could stop capitalists from making use of uneven development to subject workers to overwork, but it does not, and this non-doing of the state is a necessary condition for what capitalists do to workers: exploitation. In any case, with respect to the two major methods of labour exploitation, it can be said that if some capitalists make money by taking advantage of workers available to work for long hours (and for low wages), and other capitalists resort to technical change, the state may resort to legislations to restrict the working day and to increase wages, so a level-playing field is created.21 State action driven by inter-capitalist competition (and class struggle) and by the interests of certain (hegemonic) capitalists or capitalist fractions can in turn affect capitalist accumulation as a whole. When the state shortens the working day, this action may put pressure on all capitalists to resort to technical change as a way of increasing surplus value in its relative form. Conversely, state’s inability to shorten the working day allows many capitalists to resort to the appropriation of surplus value in its absolute form, producing a capitalism at a lower level of development, characterized by an absence of systemic increase in labour productivity per hour. 4 The state and the ‘C'-M'’ phase of capital circuit (the sphere of realization) The state helps capital access foreign markets (C'). It also creates a domestic demand for what capital produces. While the state itself is a sphere of extra-commodity or extra-economic relations, it is a massive source of market itself— demand for commodities that are produced for a profit. For the state to exist, a large number of goods and services (e.g. legal advice, knowledge, information about citizens, technical expertise, digitalization, surveillance technology, military equipment, and so on) are necessary, and through state contracts and outsourcing, the state converts these use-values into commodities and thus creates a large market, a large opportunity for capitalist investment. The state creates markets through its activities that aim to benefit those that are economically weaker or to benefit society at large. In the latter category are state contracts for the physical and social infrastructure and arms, which are actually produced by private companies for a profit on an outsourcing or PPP basis. Privatization of state services (e.g. education and healthcare) creates and expands markets for production of goods and services in the private sector. Even sensitive state activities such as consular services, where citizens’ private information are in question, have been given over to private sector capital.22 State’s environmental regulations can create new industries and opportunities for eco-capitalism: waste management, recycling, toxic waste disposal, ecotourism, and so on. An average amount of wastage in the production process — for example average amount of damage to the environment when the environment serves as a sink for polluted gases or water — is a part of the value of commodity, but an above average amount of wastage is not. The state may take steps to clean up the environment and fight global climate change, and this may create opportunities for accumulation (when, for example, the state outsources these tasks to the private businesses). Mention should be made of culture too: the state operates as a repository of culture, which in turn is physically expressed in the landscape. The production of the cultural landscape (e.g. statues of specific icons of the parties in power, museums, war memorials) by the state creates a market for capital when such production is outsourced to the private sector. The state can create markets in the form of ‘welfare-provision’. In this category are activities such as state-promoted insurance to selected groups of people (e.g. farmers; urban poor), which is sold by private companies and various welfare policies. The implementation of state’s welfare policies creates a market for commodities including when the state implements these policies through private service providers (e.g. Medicare, public housing, vaccination programme) creates new opportunities for the private sector to maximize profits by supplying public services.23 Anti-poverty policies create a market for goods and services produced by capitalists to be delivered to the poor on a subsidized basis by the state. Food subsidies for the poor domestically and food aid to poor countries create a market for agribusiness. To promote economic development in economically depressed areas, the state provides tax breaks. Consider opportunity zones (OZ) policy in the US that was introduced with bipartisan support under the Trump administration (Gose, 2020). When the value of an asset has gone up on paper, but has not yet been sold for a profit, then unrealized capital gains occur. At the end of 2017, a potential 6.1 trillion in unrealized capital gains was available for reinvestment in the US. Taxes are triggered once the asset has been sold. The state makes it possible for investors to offset or defer these taxes by investing in opportunity zones (Neufeld, 2020).24 Tax breaks and similar incentives (e.g. tax reduction, tax deferral, write-off of tax arrears, export subsidies) mean two things. One is that the tax break means that capital does not pay for the collective services — transportation, educated workforce, security, and so on — provided for by the state, so its net M' (M' after tax) remains larger than it would otherwise be. These incentives also mean, in a context of uneven development, that the state makes sure that in those areas and sectors, where the rate of profit is below the national average, businesses receive financial benefits from the state in order to be able to reap at least the average rate of profit. Through these incentives, the state makes sure that the business world gets to keep much of the surplus it appropriates from workers and small-scale producers. This happens in the form of tax exemptions, tax reduction, write-off of tax arrears, export subsidies (especially in export-oriented zones), and so on, all in the name of promoting growth and helping common people. In addition, when a company does not earn enough surplus value, that is, when it incurs losses, the state often nationalizes the losses by temporarily nationalizing the company.25 However, the state guarantees that profits ultimately remain in the private sector. 5 The state and capitalist accumulation As already indicated, it is not enough that the state helps capitalists produce and realize surplus value. The surplus value has to be constantly reinvested. This is what accumulation means. We can now make some general comments on the relation between the state and accumulation, partly based on the discussion in the last section. Accumulation is in two forms: in its ‘primitive’ or mainly extra-economic, form (primitive accumulation) and capitalist form proper. Methods of primitive accumulation include, to borrow Marx’s words, ‘the colonies, the national debt, the modern mode of taxation, and the protectionist system’, and so on and involve coercive state power. The treasures that an advanced country captures in the South flow back into the former and are invested as capital. And this form of ‘anti-value’ transfer reinforces ‘value-based’ transfer, that is, transfer based on equal exchange.”翻译为中文","completion":"有几个原因导致工人被迫长时间工作。首先，“资本家按日付费购买了劳动力。在一个工作日内，其使用价值属于他。因此，他获得了[国家捍卫的]权利，让劳动者为他工作一天”（马克思，1887：163）。从资本的角度看，“资本主义商品关系的‘自发’运作不对工作日的长度设限。从相反的角度，即劳动的角度，情况不同：可能开始时是平等交换，最终却变得不平等。如果一个工人每天工作时间过长（比如，15小时），并且因为过度工作，她的寿命减少了20%，她一生的总工资收入并未增加20%：她仍然获得的工资好像她将会过正常寿命一样。换句话说，国家支持的平等交换法则在平等交换的基础上被违反，这也是国家支持的。马克思说，“商品交换的本质自身不对工作日、剩余劳动设限”，从而允许资本家在“试图尽可能延长工作日时维护自己作为购买者的权利”。另一方面，出于自身利益，“劳动者在希望将工作日缩短至一定正常时长时保持作为卖者的权利”。所以“这里存在......权利对权利的对立，两者都同样带有交换法则的印记。在平等权利之间，力量决定胜负”（马克思，1887：163-4）。这最终是资本主义国家的力量。国家常常支持较长的工作日。 长时间的工作日以及不健康的工作条件、工作不稳定、不规律或不可预测的工作时间等导致各种身体和心理疾病。资本主义正如马克思时代一样真正地杀害着人们。“资本对劳动力的寿命毫不关心。”它通过“掠夺其肥力以从土壤中夺取更多产出，如同贪婪的农民那样缩短了劳动者的寿命”（马克思，1887：179）。工人受到资本造成的痛苦被轻蔑地视为“资本存在的必要条件”（第316页）。 不平衡发展法则介入了国家对长时间工作日的反应方式。如果资本让工人在一个地区/国家过度加班，危及健康并导致人们过早死亡，它可以从其他地区/国家，尤其是那些资本主义发展水平较低的地区（如农村地区或最不发达国家）获得新的劳动力来源，所以前者地区的工人退化受到限制：“工业人口的退化只是通过源源不断地吸收来自农村的原始且身体未受污染的元素而被延缓”（马克思，1887：181）。国家可以阻止资本家利用不平衡发展让工人过度劳累，但国家没有这样做，国家的不作为是资本家对工人所做之事的必要条件：剥削。 无论如何，关于两种主要的劳动剥削方法，可以说如果一些资本家通过利用可供长时间工作（和低工资）的工人赚钱，而其他资本家依靠技术变革，国家可能会通过立法限制工作日和提高工资，从而创造公平竞争的环境。由资本家间竞争（和阶级斗争）以及某些（霸权）资本家或资本家集团的利益驱动的国家行动反过来又可能影响整体的资本主义积累。当国家缩短工作日时，这一行动可能会对所有资本家施加压力，使他们将技术变革作为增加其相对形式剩余价值的途径。相反，国家未能缩短工作日允许许多资本家依靠以绝对形式占有剩余价值，产生一个发展水平较低、缺乏系统性提高每小时劳动生产率的资本主义。 4 国家与资本循环的‘C'-M'’阶段 （实现领域） 国家帮助资本进入外国市场（C'）。它还为资本生产的产品创造国内需求。虽然国家本身是一个额外商品或超经济关系的领域，它是一个巨大的市场来源——对以盈利生产的商品的需求。为了国家的存在，许多商品和服务（如法律咨询、知识、公民信息、技术专长、数字化、监视技术、军事装备等）是必需的，通过国家合同和外包，国家将这些使用价值转化为商品，从而创造了一个大市场，为资本家投资创造了巨大机会。 国家通过旨在帮助经济较弱者或整体社会受益的活动创造市场。后者类别包括国家对物理和社会基础设施以及军火的合同，这些实际上由私人公司以外包或PPP基础上为盈利生产。国有服务的私有化（如教育和医疗保健）创造并扩大了私营部门生产商品和服务的市场。即使是涉及公民私人信息的敏感国家活动，如领事服务，也已移交给私营部门资本。国家的环境法规可以为生态资本主义创造新的产业和机会：废物管理、回收、有毒废物处理、生态旅游等。生产过程中的平均浪费量——例如当环境作为被污染的气体或水的容器时对环境的平均损害——是商品价值的一部分，但超过平均量的浪费则不是。国家可能采取措施清理环境并对抗全球气候变化，这可能为积累创造机会（例如，当国家将这些任务外包给私人企业时）。文化也应提及：国家作为文化的仓库，反过来以景观物理表现。国家对文化景观（如执政党特定标志的雕像、博物馆、战争纪念碑）的生产创造了一个市场，当这种生产被外包给私营部门时。 国家可以以“福利提供”的形式创造市场。此类别活动包括国家向特定人群（如农民；城市贫困人口）推广的保险，由私人公司销售，以及各种福利政策。国家福利政策的实施创造了商品市场，包括当国家通过私人服务提供商（如医疗补助、公共住房、疫苗接种计划）实施这些政策时，为私营部门提供通过提供公共服务来最大化利润的新机会。反贫困政策为资本家生产的商品和服务创造了一个市场，这些商品和服务由国家以补贴方式交付给穷人。国内的食品补贴和对贫穷国家的食品援助为农业企业创造了市场。为了促进经济萧条地区的经济发展，国家提供税收优惠。考虑美国在特朗普政府时期以两党支持引入的机会区（OZ）政策（Gose，2020）。当资产的价值在纸面上上升，但尚未通过出售获得利润时，就会出现未实现的资本收益。到2017年底，美国有可供再投资的6.1万亿美元未实现资本收益。一旦资产被出售，就会引发税收。国家使投资者通过投资于机会区来抵消或推迟这些税收（Neufeld，2020）。 税收优惠和类似激励措施（例如减税、推迟缴税、免除税款欠款、出口补贴）意味着两件事。一是税收优惠意味着资本不为国家提供的集体服务——交通、受过教育的劳动力、安全等——支付费用，因此其净M'（税后M'）保持比否则更大。这些激励措施还意味着，在不平衡发展的背景下，国家确保在那些利润率低于国家平均水平的地区和部门，企业从国家获得财政利益，以便至少获得平均利润率。通过这些激励措施，国家确保商界可以保留其从工人和小规模生产者那里占有的大部分剩余，以税收豁免、减税、免除税款欠款、出口补贴（特别是在出口导向区）等形式发生，全都以促进增长和帮助普通人民的名义。此外，当一家公司未获得足够的剩余价值，即当其遭受亏损时，国家常常通过临时国有化公司来国有化亏损。然而，国家保证利润最终留在私营部门。 5 国家与资本主义积累 如前所述，国家帮助资本家生产和实现剩余价值是不够的。剩余价值必须不断重新投资。这就是积累的意义。我们现在可以对国家与积累之间的关系做一些总体评论，部分基于上一节的讨论。 积累有两种形式：它的“原始”或主要是超经济的形式（原始积累）和适当的资本主义形式。原始积累的方法包括，借用马克思的话，“殖民地、国家债务、现代税收模式和保护制度”等，并涉及强制性的国家权力。先进国家在南方捕获的财宝流回前者，并作为资本投资。这种“反价值”转移加强了基于“价值”的转移，即基于平等交换的转移。"},{"prompt":"请将“Just as state-supported primitive accumulation happens globally, so does state-assisted accumulation in its specifically capitalist form. To extend their businesses, capitalists reinvest the surplus value they appropriate. This is concentration. Then, some capitalists acquire businesses from other capitalists, making their businesses grow bigger. This is centralization. Concentration and centralization, strictly speaking, are two forms of capitalist accumulation. The state allows the development monopolies and large-scale companies including through mergers and acquisitions. It makes bulky investments in the physical infrastructure, including through its own large-scale companies. If credit ‘soon becomes a new and terrible weapon in the battle of competition and is finally transformed into an enormous social mechanism for the centralisation of capitals’ (Marx, 1887: 441), then cheap credit from the state — and injection of cash to financial markets through such things as quantitative easing26 — can contribute to centralization: some companies use the cheap money to buy other companies. The state indeed supports changes in the re-distribution of means of production as long as the people who receive assets belong to the hegemonic fraction of the ruling class. The state supports the fact that some commodity producers — for example larger and more efficient capitalists — gain at the cost of other capitalists. If the c / v is higher for some enterprises than for others, then the commodities of the enterprises with the higher organic composition will be sold at prices of production higher than value, while commodities of the enterprise with lower c / v are sold at prices of production lower than value. Capitalistic accumulation, with the rise in c / v and attendant technical change, produces a relatively redundant population of labourers, including globally (a global reserve army). As the ratio of constant to variable capital rises: capitalistic accumulation produces ‘a relatively redundant population of labourers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the self-expansion of capital, and therefore a surplus-population’ (Marx, 1887: 443). More efficient companies may swallow less efficient ones. In fact, centralization of capital also displaces people: when one company acquires another company, the new company generally employs fewer people than the number of people employed by the two erstwhile separate companies together. Capitalism ‘forms a disposable industrial reserve army, that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost’ (Marx, 1887: 444), so the reserve army is very much a part of capitalism. ‘Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates, for the changing needs of the selfexpansion of capital, a mass of human material always ready for exploitation’ (Marx, 1887: 444). The state is connected to the relative surplus population (un- and under-employed people) in at least two ways by its doings and not-doings. (a) It could take steps to make sure everyone who loses their job due to technical change in one enterprise remains employed elsewhere. It does not. It does not act to significantly counter the reserve army. It does not make sure that everyone is able to work according to their abilities and for a decent wage. (b) It controls in- and out-migration generally in the long- and short-term interests of capital (or its hegemonic fractions), so capital has access to a reserve army, especially in the South, which puts pressure on wages there as well as in the North. While state regulation of abuses in the workplace is partly a product of class struggle from below (workers’ struggle), such regulation in turn shapes the nature of capitalism. This happens when capitalists respond to state regulation, for example, by introducing machinery, which represents class struggle from above. Capitalist accumulation based on machinery, or the industrial revolution, ‘which takes place spontaneously, is artificially helped on by’ state legislations such as ‘the extension of the Factory Acts to all industries in which women, young persons and children are employed’. When the length of the working day is regulated by the state, this necessitates technological change ‘in the place of muscles’. In addition, ‘in order to make up for the loss of time’ caused by the shortening of the working day, ‘an expansion occurs of the means of production used in common, of the furnaces, buildings, &c., in one word, greater concentration of the means of production and a correspondingly greater concourse of workpeople’ (Marx, 1887: 312—3; italics added). Thus, state regulations contribute to the changes in the technical mode of production: While in each individual workshop it enforces uniformity, regularity, order, and economy, it increases by the immense spur which the limitation and regulation of the working-day [by the state] give to technical improvement, the anarchy and the catastrophes of capitalist production as a whole, the intensity of labour, and the competition of machinery with the labourer. (Marx, 1887: 329) While an educated and healthy workforce is in the interest of the whole capitalist class, the short-term interests of capitalists are adversely affected, although in different ways by different capitalists (big capitalists versus smaller capitalists). Smaller capitalists are directly affected if their access to cheaper labour is restricted by the state: ‘Unlimited exploitation of cheap labour-power is the sole foundation of their power to compete’ (as in the Global South now generally but also in many parts of the North).27 There is another way in which the state regulation can influence smaller capitalists. Because state regulation necessitates greater outlay of capital, smaller capitalists can be outcompeted by bigger capitalists: ‘owing to the necessity they impose for greater outlay of capital’, Factory Acts and similar other legislations ‘hasten on the decline of the small masters, and the concentration of capital’ (Marx, 1887: 314).28 For bigger capitalists, who are a little flexible with respect to the use of constant capital versus the use of cheap labour, state regulation means that they have to invest more in constant capital — investment in machinery, for example — to make up for the loss of cheaper labour (adults working long hours for low wages and children labour).29 Of course, it is true that so soon as capital ‘finds itself subject to legal control at one point, compensates itself all the more recklessly at other points’ (Marx, 1887: 320). For example, if the working day is reduced, wages can be reduced, or mechanization can be introduced expanding unemployment, which puts pressure on wages. Similarly, if the working day is reduced here, workers can be made to work longer hours elsewhere, and if wages are higher here, workers can be made to work for lower wages there. Factory Acts that seek to ensure workers’ safety in the workplace, regulate the working day, and so on remain un- or under-implemented. This is in part because of the need to cut costs, one that is expressed by the nefarious nexus of state officials/politicians and the business world and the overall climate of free market ideology. With this, capital’s despotic rule in the labour process becomes even more despotic, a despotic rule that is strengthened by the ease with which capital can hire and fire labour with the support of the state. The existing rules protecting nature and workers from the harmful effects of capitalist production are gutted as soon as there arises a slight political opportunity (e.g. weakness of anti-capital and anti-state organizations). All this makes for a heightened level of accumulation by exploitation. Irrespective of the size of capital invested, certain enterprises can be more adversely affected by state regulation of the working day than other enterprises. For example, capitalists investing in chemical and metallurgical industries (e.g. earthenware trade, in bleaching, dyeing, baking, and in most of the metal industries where the discontinuity in the labour process will affect production adversely) can complain of state-legislated pauses in the working day. When capitalists ignore the general laws of the state that seek to protect workers from excesses of capitalism and when the state does little, this MOM-action is a specific form of active state action. In parts of a country (e.g. special economic zones), the state makes it legal that its laws do not operate, that they are negated. This amounts to ‘a state of exception’, created by the state, in the economic sphere. The state protects the conditions for the production of value and surplus value. Appropriation of surplus value and countering any potential/actual resistance to exploitation require that the workplace be the site of capitalists’ private legislation, of capitalists’ despotic control. The state defends this, if necessary, through public (nationwide) legislation and its coercive powers. The state makes sure the worker has no control over surplus value and remains separated from it, the surplus value that can contribute to further accumulation and becomes a means of exploitation.30 6 The state and tendencies/counter-tendencies towards the crisis of accumulation The literature on capitalist crisis tends to focus on the relevant ratios trying to prove that capitalism does go through the crisis of profitability.31 In other words, a necessary focus has been on ‘the economic’. This is, of course, fundamental, but the crisis-proneness of the capitalist economy — ‘oscillations of the economic conjuncture (boom-depression-crisis)’ — has palpable political implications for the state too: The revenues of possessing classes, the state budget, wages, unemployment, proportions of foreign trade, etc., are intimately bound up with the economic conjuncture, and in their turn exert the most direct influence on politics. This alone is enough to make one understand how important and fruitful it is to follow step by step the history of political parties, state institutions, etc., in relation to the cycles of capitalist development. (Trotsky, 1923) In capitalism, there is an overall tendency towards the rate of technical change as expressed in the ratio of constant capital to variable capital rising faster than the rate of exploitation as expressed as the ratio of surplus value to variable capital. This causes a tendency of the rate of (average) profit to fall (TRPF) (Carchedi and Roberts, 2018; Smith, 2018; Smith et al., 2021). With the capitalist system experiencing a crisis of profitability, there is a crisis of investment in the production of goods and services. This crisis of profitability may sectorally or geographically, or otherwise, appear as the crisis of over-production and over-accumulation, which the state seeks to counter (Hirsch, 1978: 97; Poulantzas, 2008: 306). Figure 7.3 shows the chain of causal links involved in the production of crisis.32 The state takes several steps to respond to the recurrent economic crisis, the crisis of accumulation, and these steps aim to increase exploitation and/or cheapen elements of constant capital.”翻译为中文","completion":"正如全球范围内国家支持的原始积累一样，特定资本主义形式的国家协助积累也在发生。为了扩大他们的业务，资本家对他们占有的剩余价值进行再投资。这是集中。然后，一些资本家从其他资本家手中收购企业，使他们的企业变得更大。这是中央集权。严格来说，集中和中央集权是资本主义积累的两种形式。 国家允许垄断和大型公司的发展，包括通过兼并和收购。它对物理基础设施，包括通过自己的大型公司进行大笔投资。如果信贷“很快成为竞争战场上的一种新的可怕武器，并最终转变为资本集中的巨大社会机制”（马克思，1887：441），那么国家提供的廉价信贷——通过量化宽松等措施向金融市场注入现金——可以促进中央集权：一些公司使用廉价资金购买其他公司。国家确实支持重新分配生产资料的变化，只要接收资产的人属于统治阶级的霸权部分。国家支持某些商品生产者——例如更大、更高效的资本家——以其他资本家为代价获益的事实。如果某些企业的c/v比其他企业高，那么具有更高有机构成的企业的商品将以高于价值的生产价格出售，而具有较低c/v的企业的商品将以低于价值的生产价格出售。 随着c/v的上升和相应的技术变革，资本主义积累产生了相对过剩的劳动人口，包括全球范围内（全球后备军）。随着固定资本与流动资本的比率上升：资本主义积累产生了“相对过剩的劳动人口，即超出资本自我扩张的平均需求的人口规模，因而形成了剩余人口”（马克思，1887：443）。更高效的公司可能会吞噬效率较低的公司。事实上，资本的集中化也会置人于流离失所：当一家公司收购另一家公司时，新公司通常雇佣的人数少于两个原本独立公司合并前的总人数。资本主义“形成了一个可任意支配的工业后备军，这个后备军就像资本自己花费成本培育的一样，完全属于资本”（马克思，1887：444），因此后备军是资本主义不可或缺的一部分。“独立于人口实际增长的限制，它为资本自我扩张的变化需求，创造了一批随时准备被剥削的人类物质”（马克思，1887：444）。 国家通过其所做和不做，至少以两种方式与相对剩余人口（失业和就业不足的人）相关。（a）它可以采取措施确保因一个企业的技术变革而失业的每个人在其他地方仍然受雇。它没有这么做。它没有采取有效措施对抗后备军。它没有确保每个人都能根据他们的能力以体面的工资工作。（b）它通常从资本（或其霸权部分）的长期和短期利益出发，控制进出移民，因此资本能够获取后备军，特别是在南方，这对那里以及北方的工资构成压力。 工作场所的虐待行为受到国家监管，部分是来自下层（工人斗争）的阶级斗争的产物，但这种监管反过来又塑造了资本主义的性质。当资本家响应国家监管时发生这种情况，例如，通过引入机械，这代表了来自上层的阶级斗争。基于机械或工业革命的资本主义积累，“通过国家立法（例如将工厂法扩展到所有雇佣妇女、青少年和儿童的行业）的人为协助，发生了自发的变化”。当国家通过立法规定工作日长度时，这就需要技术变革来“代替肌肉”。此外，“为了弥补工作日缩短造成的时间损失”，“共同使用的生产资料——炉子、建筑物等的扩张发生了”，换言之，“生产资料的更大集中和相应更多的工人聚集”（马克思，1887：312-3；斜体字为补充）。 因此，国家法规有助于技术生产模式的变化： “虽然在每个单独的车间中它强制执行一致性、规律性、秩序和经济性，但通过国家对工作日的限制和规定给技术改进带来的巨大推动，它增加了资本主义生产整体的无政府状态和灾难，劳动强度以及机械与劳动者的竞争。” （马克思，1887：329） 对整个资本家阶级来说，受过教育且健康的劳动力符合其利益，但资本家的短期利益受到不同方式的负面影响（大资本家与小资本家）。国家限制更廉价劳动力的获取直接影响小资本家：“不受限制地剥削廉价劳动力是他们竞争力量的唯一基础”（正如目前全球南方普遍以及北方许多地区所见）。国家监管还以另一种方式影响小资本家。因为国家监管需要更多的资本支出，小资本家可能被大资本家击败：“由于它们需要更多的资本支出”，工厂法和类似立法“加速了小企业主的衰落和资本的集中”（马克思，1887：314）。 对于较灵活地在固定资本与廉价劳动力使用之间权衡的大资本家来说，国家监管意味着他们必须更多地投资于固定资本——例如，投资于机械——以弥补廉价劳动力的损失（成年人长时间工作的低工资和儿童劳动）。当然，资本一旦“发现自己在某一点受到法律控制，就会在其他点上更加肆无忌惮地补偿自己”（马克思，1887：320）。例如，如果工作日缩短，工资可以降低，或者可以引入机械化以扩大失业，从而对工资构成压力。同样，如果这里的工作日缩短，工人可以在其他地方被迫工作更长时间，如果这里的工资更高，工人可以在那里以更低的工资工作。 寻求确保工人安全的工厂法，规范工作日等，执行不力或未得到执行。这部分是因为需要削减成本，这一需求通过国家官员/政治家与商界的恶性联系以及自由市场意识形态的整体氛围得以体现。有了这一点，资本在劳动过程中的专制统治变得更加专制，这种专制统治通过国家的支持，使资本更容易雇佣和解雇劳动力而得到加强。保护自然和工人免受资本主义生产有害影响的现有规则，一旦出现轻微的政治机会（例如，反资本和反国家组织的弱点）就会被废除。所有这些都使得通过剥削加剧积累的水平提高。 不同企业受国家对工作日监管的影响程度可能不同。例如，投资于化学和冶金行业的资本家（如陶器贸易、漂白、染色、烘焙以及大部分金属行业，其中劳动过程的不连续性将对生产产生不利影响）可能会对国家法定的工作日间歇抱怨。 当资本家无视旨在保护工人免受资本主义过度行为影响的国家的一般法律，而国家几乎不采取行动时，这种不作为是国家积极行动的一种特定形式。在一个国家的部分地区（如特殊经济区），国家使其法律不适用，即被否定，成为合法。这相当于由国家创造的经济领域的“例外状态”。国家保护价值和剩余价值生产的条件。剥夺剩余价值和对抗任何潜在/实际的剥削抵抗需要工作场所成为资本家私人立法、资本家专制控制的场所。如有必要，国家通过公共（全国性）立法及其强制力捍卫这一点。国家确保工人无法控制剩余价值，并与之分离，这种剩余价值可以促进进一步的积累并成为剥削的手段。 6 国家与积累危机的趋势/反趋势 关于资本主义危机的文献倾向于关注相关比率，试图证明资本主义确实经历了利润率危机。换句话说，主要关注的是“经济”。这当然是基本的，但资本主义经济的危机倾向——“经济形势（繁荣-萧条-危机）的波动”——也对国家有明显的政治影响： “占有阶级的收入、国家预算、工资、失业、对外贸易比例等，都与经济形势密切相关，反过来对政治施加最直接的影响。这足以让人理解，跟踪政治党派、国家机构等的历史步步为营，与资本主义发展周期相联系，是多么重要且富有成果。 （托洛茨基，1923） 在资本主义中，固定资本与流动资本的比率上升的总体趋势比剩余价值与流动资本之比表示的剥削率上升得更快。这会导致平均利润率下降的趋势（TRPF）（Carchedi和Roberts，2018；Smith，2018；Smith等，2021）。随着资本主义系统经历利润率危机，商品和服务生产的投资出现危机。这种利润率危机可能在部门或地区上，或以其他方式，表现为过度生产和过度积累危机，国家寻求对抗（Hirsch，1978：97；Poulantzas，2008：306）。图7.3显示了危机产生的因果链。国家采取若干措施响应反复出现的经济危机、积累危机，这些措施旨在增加剥削和/或降低固定资本成分的成本。"},{"prompt":"请将“The state is connected to every stage in the formation of the crisis. First of all, the state helps capitalists increase the rate of exploitation. ‘The degree of exploitation of labour, the appropriation of surplus-labour and surplus-value, is raised notably by lengthening the working-day and intensifying labour’ (Marx, 1894: 165). This the state seeks to facilitate. Legislations prolong the working day, or the state does little to stop capitalists make workers work longer than the legal working day. However, and as mentioned, there is a constant tendency towards technical change expressed in the form of a rise in c / v. To this, the state contributes. When, in part, because of working-class struggle and to serve the long-term interests of the capitalist class a whole, the state introduces legislation to restrict capitalists’ greed for surplus value through excessive prolongation of the working day, and through other mechanisms, such state intervention forces capitalists, initially in bigger enterprises, to resort to technical change and to invest more in constant capital (Figure 7.3). While in each individual workshop it [pro-worker legislation] enforces uniformity, regularity, order, and economy, it increases by the immense spur which the limitation and regulation of the working day give to technical improvement, the anarchy and the catastrophes of capitalist production as a whole, the intensity of labour, and the competition of machinery with the labourer. (Marx, 1887: 329; italics added) Insofar as the state policies contribute towards technical change, the state is connected to the tendency towards the formation of the crisis. As mentioned, while the average rate of profit tends to drop because c / v rises faster than s/v, the opposite can also conjuncturally happen: increased rate of exploitation can counter the tendency towards the rate of profit to fall. There are various methods of increasing exploitation to which the state is connected. Marx (1894) says that ‘the tendency towards a reduction in the rate of profit is notably weakened by a rise in the rate of absolute surplus-value, which originates with the lengthening of the working-day’. The state helps capital prolong the working day.33 Formal subsumption of labour (FSL) (employment of labour for long hours) is a method of appropriating absolute surplus value, and employers are able to engage in this especially when there is a massive reserve army of labour: when there are many un- or under-employed people around, one can be forced to work longer, and this is possible when the state does nothing to counter this. Marx develops this idea in Capital volume 1 (see Das, 2017a: 340—90, 2012). The reserve army or the relative over-population, Marx says in Capital volume 3, ‘is the reason why . . . the more or less imperfect subordination of labour to capital continues in many branches of production’ (Marx, 1894: 167). Among the various other methods of increasing exploitation is ‘the widespread introduction of female and child labour. Exploitation is increased because the whole family must now perform more surplus-labour for capital than before, even when the total amount of their wages increases’ (Marx, 1894: 166). The rate of exploitation can be increased in the sphere of circulation by depressing the wages below the value of labour power (further than it already might be). And here the state plays an important role too, including by making it difficult for workers to strike, by reducing or denying economic support (e.g. unemployment insurance, food stamps, anti-poverty assistance, and so on) to the reserve army of labour, and by not forcing capital to pay a wage that at least conforms to the value of labour power. The state can contribute towards the cheapening of elements of constant capital via its investment in science and technology and also through the liberalization of trade which brings cheaper means of production from abroad. It can facilitate foreign trade (liberalization of trade under neoliberalism): ‘foreign trade partly cheapens the elements of constant capital, and partly the necessities of life for which the variable capital is exchanged’, so ‘it tends to raise the rate of profit by increasing the rate of surplus-value and lowering the value of constant capital’ (Marx, 1894: 168). Grossman (1929) says, ‘[A]n injection of surplus value by means of foreign trade would raise the rate of profit and reduce the severity of the breakdown tendency’ because ‘the original surplus value expands by means of transfers from abroad’. Of course, often multiple states may experience crisis at a given point in time, so given their inter-dependency at the global level, competition among countries intensifies: every country tries to export the effect of the crisis to another country. When the state enables greater foreign trade and indeed foreign investment, the scope for extensive exploitation of labour expands. When capital is invested in the periphery (excolonies, and the like), this allows heightened level of ‘exploitation of labour’, at least, in part ‘because of the use of unfree labour’ (Marx, 1894: 168). Several processes during what is called neoliberalism have countered falling profitability. Neoliberal reforms — anti-trade union legislation, privatization of state companies, cuts in pensions and government services, lowering of corporate taxes, and increase in taxes on spending — all have countered, and were meant to counter, the falling profitability in the post-war period until late 1970s (Roberts, 2016: 61). The rate of increase in surplus value has risen faster than the rise in c / v. The development of high-tech dot-com revolution in the 1990s, which was based on initial state investment, led to the cheapening of constant capital, making sure that c / v did not rise in many countries (ibid.). Often the state bails out bankrupt companies: the state bailed out the insurance company AIG in order to meet in full the insurance claims on losses on speculative investments made by the likes of Goldman Sachs’ (ibid.: 67). This meant that ‘taxpayers ended up fully compensating the big banks for the losses they incurred from their own recklessness and greed’. Bailout is followed by cut in government welfare spending, higher taxes on wage workers, and reduction in the cost of pensions (deferred wages) by extending retirement ages. In other words, in trying to counter the crisis, the state makes workers pay for the crisis. Capital does not come out of its recurrent crises spontaneously but through state assistance given to it. (See the short Appendix to this chapter that provides a very basic and provisional outline of how one can examine the crisis in relation to the state.) 7 Summary, and theoretical and political implications In this chapter, I have examined the state’s role in production by employing Marx’s general formula for capital (M-CM'). It is clear that, the state, whether it is a so-called neoliberal state or not, connects to each phase of the capitalist circuit. It seeks to make sure capitalist accumulation, including concentration and centralization, occurs. By facilitating cheapening of constant capital and by helping capital increase the rate of exploitation, the state seeks to counter the tendency for the average rate of profit to fall. It is in the very nature of capitalist state power that it will fundamentally protect the interests of the capitalist class. This fact sets limits on the state. One is the outer limit: the state must ensure the right of the capitalist class to own property in its specifically capitalist form: to buy and sell for profit, to appropriate surplus (whether in p-roduction or outside), to dispossess direct producers, and so on. One of the other (two) limits (apart from creating appropriate ideological conditions) is the one that is indicated by the fact that the state must ensure conditions for capitalist accumulation within the framework of capitalist property relation, in a country and globally (or at least it must not undermine these conditions). The significance of this outer limit is this: capital is a class relation, which is expressed as things (money, capital investment, machines, and so on) and which must keep moving, so it is useless for the capitalist class to just maintain its ownership of property, with the help of the state, if its property is not put to use to produce more money. For the state to contribute to such a process (i.e. accumulation of wealth for its sake), it is neither enough to create/sustain property rights nor is it enough that the state ensure free commodity exchange. The state must ensure that the separated means of production and subsistence are turned into capital and that the capitalists constituting the new ruling class are, like the older ruling classes, able to appropriate the unpaid surplus labour from direct producers, even if they pay the full value of the commodity they purchase (i.e. labour power). It must ensure that the money with which labour power is bought is actually the surplus value that has already been appropriated from workers. If commodities produced are not sold (realized) then the value of the commodities is lost, so the state tries to help capitalists with the realization of value by expanding markets for commodities. The chapter has a series of theoretical implications. I turn to these now. Firstly, the state’s role in relation to the capitalist circuit and in relation to capitalist accumulation and crisis must be seen as a tendency, and like any other tendency it is subject to counter-tendencies. The state cannot help capitalist accumulation beyond a point. There are many reasons for this. One major one is that the internal relations between the state and capitalists which define the outer limit means that the state must not generally have control over private capitalist investment decisions. There is also a contradiction between the socialized production process and the privatized appropriation of the benefits from such a process, thus creating conditions for recurrent economic crisis. So, there is a limit to the extent to which the capitalist state can help capitalist accumulation. There is also the contradiction between worldwide capitalist accumulation and nation-state political framework of capitalism. This contradiction restricts the state — that is, particular nation-states — from being able to resolve the problems that capitalist accumulation faces. Secondly, while from one vantage point, there is a pressure on the state to seek to produce the general conditions for capitalist accumulation by spending the tax money, from another perspective, it is not absolutely necessary that the state will produce those conditions in a de-commodified manner. There is actually no absolute reason, from the standpoint of capital, why the state has to provide, for example, school education or public transportation: these conditions can be provided for in a more or less commodified manner by capital for a profit, as we have been seeing under what is called neoliberal capitalism. Consider these remarkable lines from Marx (1973: 532) from Grundrisse: ‘The highest development of capital exists when the general conditions of the process of social production are not paid out of deductions from the social revenue, the state’s taxes . . . but rather out of capital as capital.’34 Yet the state is called upon to provide some of the general conditions for accumulation. This partly shows the potential ‘weakness’ of capitalist development.”翻译为中文","completion":"国家与危机形成的每个阶段都有联系。首先，国家帮助资本家提高剥削率。“劳动的剥削程度，剩余劳动和剩余价值的占有，通过延长工作日和加剧劳动而显著提高”（马克思，1894：165）。国家寻求促进这一点。立法延长了工作日，或者国家对资本家让工人超过法定工作日工作的行为采取了不作为的态度。 然而，正如提到的，技术变革表现为c / v上升的趋势是固有的。在这方面，国家有所贡献。当部分由于工人阶级的斗争并为了整个资本家阶级的长期利益，国家通过立法限制资本家通过过度延长工作日对剩余价值的贪婪追求，以及通过其他机制，这种国家干预迫使资本家，最初在大型企业中，转向技术变革并在固定资本上投资更多（图7.3）。 “虽然每个单独的车间中，它[亲劳工立法]实施了一致性、规律性、秩序和经济性，但它因工作日限制和规定给技术改进带来的巨大推动，增加了整体资本主义生产的无政府状态和灾难、劳动强度，以及机械与劳动者的竞争。” （马克思，1887：329；斜体字为补充） 只要国家政策促进了技术变革，国家就与危机形成的趋势有关。 正如提到的，虽然由于c / v上升的速度快于s/v，平均利润率倾向于下降，但相反的情况也可能在特定情境下发生：提高剥削率可以抵消利润率下降的趋势。国家与增加剥削的各种方法有关。 马克思（1894）说，“通过延长工作日产生绝对剩余价值率的提高，明显削弱了利润率降低的趋势”。国家帮助资本延长工作日。正式归属于劳动（FSL）（长时间雇佣劳动）是占有绝对剩余价值的一种方法，雇主能够特别在有大量后备劳动力的情况下进行这种做法：当周围有许多失业或就业不足的人时，可以被迫工作更长时间，而这在国家对此不采取任何行动时是可能的。马克思在《资本论》第一卷中发展了这一观点（见Das，2017a：340—90，2012）。马克思在《资本论》第三卷中说，后备军或相对过剩人口，“是为什么……在许多生产部门中，劳动对资本的或多或少不完善的从属关系持续存在的原因”（马克思，1894：167）。增加剥削的其他方法之一是“大范围引入女性和儿童劳动。剥削增加了，因为整个家庭现在必须为资本执行更多的剩余劳动，即使他们的工资总额增加了”（马克思，1894：166）。在流通领域，通过压低工资到低于劳动力价值（可能已经很低了）的水平，可以增加剥削率。国家在这里也发挥重要作用，包括通过使工人难以罢工，通过减少或拒绝对后备劳动力提供经济支持（如失业保险、食品券、反贫困援助等），以及不迫使资本支付至少与劳动力价值相一致的工资。 国家可以通过对科学和技术的投资以及通过贸易自由化使来自国外的更便宜的生产资料进口，促进固定资本成分的廉价化。它可以促进外贸（新自由主义下的贸易自由化）：“外贸部分降低了固定资本的成分，也部分降低了用于交换流动资本的生活必需品”，因此“它通过提高剩余价值率和降低固定资本价值倾向于提高利润率”（马克思，1894：168）。格罗斯曼（1929）说，“通过外贸注入剩余价值将提高利润率，并减轻崩溃趋势的严重性”，因为“原始剩余价值通过来自国外的转移而扩大”。当然，经常有多个国家在同一时间点经历危机，因此鉴于全球层面的相互依赖，国家间的竞争加剧：每个国家都试图将危机的影响转移到另一个国家。当国家促进更大规模的外贸，实际上是外国投资时，剥削劳动力的范围扩大了。当资本投资于外围地区（前殖民地等），这允许至少部分地“因使用非自由劳动”而提高“剥削劳动”的水平（马克思，1894：168）。 所谓新自由主义期间的几个过程抵消了利润率下降。新自由主义改革——反工会立法、国有公司私有化、削减养老金和政府服务、降低企业税和增加消费税——都抵消了，并且旨在抵消战后时期直到1970年代末的利润率下降（罗伯茨，2016：61）。剩余价值增加的速度比c / v上升的速度快。基于最初国家投资的高科技互联网革命在1990年代导致固定资本廉价化，确保在许多国家c / v没有上升（同上）。经常国家对破产公司进行纾困：例如国家对保险公司AIG进行纾困，以全额支付像高盛这样的公司在投机投资上的亏损保险索赔（同上：67）。这意味着“纳税人最终全额补偿了大银行因自己的鲁莽和贪婪而遭受的损失”。纾困之后是削减政府福利支出、增加工资劳动者的税收和降低养老金的成本（延长退休年龄）。换句话说，为了应对危机，国家让工人为危机买单。资本没有凭借自身力量走出反复出现的危机，而是通过国家对其提供的援助。（参见本章简短的附录，它提供了一个非常基础和初步的概述，说明如何关联国家和危机。） 7 总结及理论和政治含义 在本章中，我通过采用马克思对资本的一般公式（M-C-M'）检验了国家在生产中的作用。显然，无论是所谓的新自由主义国家还是其他形式的国家，都与资本主义循环的每个阶段相连。它寻求确保资本主义积累的发生，包括集中和中央集权。通过促进固定资本的廉价化和帮助资本提高剥削率，国家寻求抵消平均利润率下降的趋势。 资本主义国家的本质决定了它将基本上保护资本家阶级的利益。这一事实为国家设定了限制。一个是外部限制：国家必须确保资本家阶级拥有以其特别资本主义形式拥有财产的权利：为了利润买卖、占有剩余（无论是在生产中还是在生产外）、剥夺直接生产者等。另一个（两个）限制之一（除了创造适当的意识形态条件外）是国家必须确保在资本主义财产关系框架内，国家和全球范围内为资本主义积累确保条件（或至少不破坏这些条件）。这个外部限制的重要性在于：资本是一种阶级关系，表现为事物（金钱、资本投资、机器等）并且必须保持流动，所以如果国家帮助资本家阶级仅维持其财产所有权而不将其用于生产更多的金钱，这对资本家阶级来说是无用的。为了国家贡献于这样的过程（即为了自身的财富积累），仅仅创建/维持财产权利是不够的，国家确保自由商品交换也是不够的。国家必须确保分离的生产和生存手段转化为资本，新的统治阶级的资本家，就像旧的统治阶级一样，能够占有来自直接生产者的未付剩余劳动，即使他们支付了他们购买的商品（即劳动力）的全部价值。它必须确保用来购买劳动力的金钱实际上是已经从工人那里占有的剩余价值。如果生产的商品没有被卖出（实现），那么商品的价值就会丧失，所以国家试图通过扩大商品市场来帮助资本家实现价值。本章有一系列理论含义。我现在转向这些。 首先，国家与资本主义循环以及资本主义积累和危机的关系必须被视为一种趋势，就像任何其他趋势一样，它受到反趋势的影响。国家无法在某一点之外帮助资本主义积累。这有许多原因。一个主要原因是国家与资本家之间的内在关系决定了外部限制意味着国家通常不得控制私人资本家的投资决策。生产过程的社会化与从这一过程中获益的私人化之间也存在矛盾，从而创造了经济危机的反复条件。因此，资本主义国家在帮助资本主义积累方面存在限制。资本主义积累的全球性与民族国家政治框架之间的矛盾限制了国家——即特定的民族国家——无法解决资本主义积累面临的问题。 其次，从一个角度看，国家面临着通过使用税收资金来生产资本主义积累的一般条件的压力，但从另一个角度来看，国家并不绝对必要以非商品化的方式生产这些条件。实际上，并没有绝对的理由，从资本的立场来看，国家必须提供，例如，学校教育或公共交通：这些条件可以由资本以或多或少商品化的方式为了利润提供，正如我们在所谓的新自由主义资本主义下所看到的。考虑马克思（1973：532）在《Grundrisse》中的这些引人注目的话：“当社会生产过程的一般条件不是通过从社会收入中扣除、国家的税收......而是直接由资本作为资本支付时，资本的最高发展存在。”然而国家被要求提供一些积累的一般条件。这部分显示了资本主义发展的潜在“弱点”。"},{"prompt":"Что такое переход Smooth transition to: в киносценарии?","completion":"В киносценарии термин \\"переход Smooth transition to:\\" означает плавный, естественный переход от одного сценарного момента к другому.

Современные режиссёры и сценаристы продолжают прибегать к различным методам перехода, включая плавные, для достижения определённых эффектов в своих произведениях. Плавные переходы, например, могут использоваться для подчёркивания связи между сценами, для создания особого настроения или для поддержания динамики рассказа без резких и отвлекающих скачков. Это также может быть ценный инструмент для структурирования нелинейных повествований или фильмов и сериалов, где переплетение разных сюжетных линий требует особенно тонкого и продуманного подхода к переходам между сценами. С развитием цифровых технологий возникли новые возможности для креативных и инновационных переходов, которые могут усиливать визуальный и эмоциональный эффект кинематографического произведения.

However, several countries, especially those with significant coastal areas and rich fishing traditions, like Japan, Iceland, and Norway, also have high fish consumption rates among their populations. Fish and seafood are integral parts of the diet in these countries, not only because of their proximity to fishing grounds but also due to cultural preferences and dietary habits."},{"prompt":"they should use this thing i see called red 40","completion":"Red 40, also known as Allura Red AC, is a synthetic dye used in various food products, cosmetics, and medications to give them a specific color, typically a bright red or pink. This dye is derived from petroleum and is one of the most commonly used artificial food dyes in the United States and other parts of the world. It’s found in a wide range of products including candies, soft drinks, children’s medications, and more. However, the use of Red 40 has been a subject of controversy and debate. Some studies, primarily in animals, have suggested a potential link between consumption of artificial food dyes and adverse health effects such as hyperactivity in children, allergic reactions, and possibly even cancer. However, these findings are not conclusive, and the scientific community has not reached a consensus on the matter. As a result, regulatory bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to approve its use, stating that it is safe within the limits of current consumption levels. In terms of using Red 40 specifically for seafood or enhancing the color of fish, it's important to consider several factors: 1. **Applicability**: The appropriate use of any food colorant depends on the characteristics of the food product and the desired outcome. Red 40 is water-soluble, which could make it suitable for marinating certain types of seafood if color enhancement is desired. 2. **Regulatory Approval**: The use of Red 40, like all food additives, is subject to regulatory approval and guidelines specifying where and how it can be used, including in seafood products. 3. **Consumer Perception**: Consumer acceptance of colored seafood products would greatly depend on cultural expectations and the transparency of labeling. In some cases, artificially enhancing the color of seafood might be negatively perceived, especially among consumers prioritizing natural and unprocessed foods. 4. **Health and Safety**: Considering the ongoing debates and research into the safety of artificial food dyes, it's crucial for food producers to weigh the benefits of using these additives against potential health concerns and regulatory limitations. In conclusion, while Red 40 is widely used in the food industry, its application to fish or seafood would need careful consideration of regulatory, health, and consumer acceptance factors."},{"prompt":"Itt ez a feladat elektronikából: Az alábbi kapcsolást használjuk feszültség erősítésére: Vin - R1 - [csomópont] - R2 - Vout Ahol a csomópont rá van kötve az erősítő - oldalára is, és az erősítő + oldala le van földelve.

**确保恢复状态**：重新加载训练时，确保优化器和学习率调度器的状态也被从checkpoint中正确恢复。 - **检查和修正学习率调度**：如果需要，根据已经完成的epoch数调整学习率调度的配置或逻辑，确保学习率的变化符合您的预期。 - **清查训练代码**：审查训练过程的代码，确认是否有任何地方对学习率进行了未预期的修改。 最后，为了具体诊断和解决问题，建议详细审查训练脚本和相关配置，需要重点关注学习率调度器的初始化和状态恢复逻辑部分。"},{"prompt":"在from easydict import EasyDict as edict import yaml \\"\\"\\" Add default config for ceutrack. \\"\\"\\" cfg = edict() # MODEL cfg.MODEL = edict() cfg.MODEL.PRETRAIN_FILE = \\"mae_pretrain_vit_base.pth\\" cfg.MODEL.EXTRA_MERGER = False cfg.MODEL.RETURN_INTER = False cfg.MODEL.RETURN_STAGES = [] # MODEL.BACKBONE cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE = edict() cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.TYPE = \\"vit_base_patch16_224\\" cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.STRIDE = 16 cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.MID_PE = False cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.SEP_SEG = False cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CAT_MODE = 'direct' cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.MERGE_LAYER = 0 cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.ADD_CLS_TOKEN = False cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CLS_TOKEN_USE_MODE = 'ignore' cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CE_LOC = [] cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CE_KEEP_RATIO = [] cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CE_TEMPLATE_RANGE = 'ALL' # choose between ALL, CTR_POINT, CTR_REC, GT_BOX # MODEL.HEAD cfg.MODEL.HEAD = edict() cfg.MODEL.HEAD.TYPE = \\"CENTER\\" cfg.MODEL.HEAD.NUM_CHANNELS = 256 # TRAIN cfg.TRAIN = edict() cfg.TRAIN.LR = 0.0001 cfg.TRAIN.WEIGHT_DECAY = 0.0001 cfg.TRAIN.EPOCH = 500 cfg.TRAIN.LR_DROP_EPOCH = 400 cfg.TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE = 16 cfg.TRAIN.NUM_WORKER = 8 cfg.TRAIN.OPTIMIZER = \\"ADAMW\\" cfg.TRAIN.BACKBONE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1 cfg.TRAIN.GIOU_WEIGHT = 2.0 cfg.TRAIN.L1_WEIGHT = 5.0 cfg.TRAIN.FOCAL_WEIGHT = 1.0 cfg.TRAIN.FREEZE_LAYERS = [0, ] cfg.TRAIN.PRINT_INTERVAL = 50 cfg.TRAIN.VAL_EPOCH_INTERVAL = 5 cfg.TRAIN.GRAD_CLIP_NORM = 0.1 cfg.TRAIN.AMP = False cfg.TRAIN.CE_START_EPOCH = 20 # candidate elimination start epoch cfg.TRAIN.CE_WARM_EPOCH = 80 # candidate elimination warm up epoch cfg.TRAIN.DROP_PATH_RATE = 0.1 # drop path rate for ViT backbone # TRAIN.SCHEDULER cfg.TRAIN.SCHEDULER = edict() cfg.TRAIN.SCHEDULER.TYPE = \\"step\\" cfg.TRAIN.SCHEDULER.DECAY_RATE = 0.1 cfg.TRAIN.SCHEDULER.MILESTONES = [50, 80] cfg.TRAIN.SCHEDULER.GAMMA = 0.1 # DATA cfg.DATA = edict() cfg.DATA.SAMPLER_MODE = \\"causal\\" # sampling methods cfg.DATA.MEAN = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] cfg.DATA.STD = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225] cfg.DATA.MAX_SAMPLE_INTERVAL = 200 # DATA.TRAIN cfg.DATA.TRAIN = edict() cfg.DATA.TRAIN.DATASETS_NAME = [\\"LASOT\\", \\"GOT10K_vottrain\\"] cfg.DATA.TRAIN.DATASETS_RATIO = [1, 1] cfg.DATA.TRAIN.SAMPLE_PER_EPOCH = 60000 # DATA.VAL cfg.DATA.VAL = edict() cfg.DATA.VAL.DATASETS_NAME = [\\"GOT10K_votval\\"] cfg.DATA.VAL.DATASETS_RATIO = [1] cfg.DATA.VAL.SAMPLE_PER_EPOCH = 10000 # DATA.SEARCH cfg.DATA.SEARCH = edict() cfg.DATA.SEARCH.SIZE = 320 cfg.DATA.SEARCH.FACTOR = 5.0 cfg.DATA.SEARCH.CENTER_JITTER = 4.5 cfg.DATA.SEARCH.SCALE_JITTER = 0.5 cfg.DATA.SEARCH.NUMBER = 1 # DATA.TEMPLATE cfg.DATA.TEMPLATE = edict() cfg.DATA.TEMPLATE.NUMBER = 1 cfg.DATA.TEMPLATE.SIZE = 128 cfg.DATA.TEMPLATE.FACTOR = 2.0 cfg.DATA.TEMPLATE.CENTER_JITTER = 0 cfg.DATA.TEMPLATE.SCALE_JITTER = 0 # TEST cfg.TEST = edict() cfg.TEST.TEMPLATE_FACTOR = 2.0 cfg.TEST.TEMPLATE_SIZE = 128 cfg.TEST.SEARCH_FACTOR = 5.0 cfg.TEST.SEARCH_SIZE = 320 cfg.TEST.EPOCH = 500 def _edict2dict(dest_dict, src_edict): if isinstance(dest_dict, dict) and isinstance(src_edict, dict): for k, v in src_edict.items(): if not isinstance(v, edict): dest_dict[k] = v else: dest_dict[k] = {} _edict2dict(dest_dict[k], v) else: return def gen_config(config_file): cfg_dict = {} _edict2dict(cfg_dict, cfg) with open(config_file, 'w') as f: yaml.dump(cfg_dict, f, default_flow_style=False) def _update_config(base_cfg, exp_cfg): if isinstance(base_cfg, dict) and isinstance(exp_cfg, edict): for k, v in exp_cfg.items(): if k in base_cfg: if not isinstance(v, dict): base_cfg[k] = v else: _update_config(base_cfg[k], v) else: raise ValueError(\\"{} not exist in config.py\\".format(k)) else: return def update_config_from_file(filename, base_cfg=None): exp_config = None with open(filename) as f: exp_config = edict(yaml.safe_load(f)) if base_cfg is not None: _update_config(base_cfg, exp_config) else: _update_config(cfg, exp_config) 中需要怎么修改LR","completion":"要修改学习率 (\`LR\`) 并确保它能够在继续训练时正确地应用，需要首先确认所要使用的配置文件。根据您的需求，如果是希望在继续训练过程（假设是从第50个epoch开始的checkpoint）中直接将学习率调整为0.000005，您应当在继续训练之前调整配置文件中的学习率设置，并确保这一配置正确加载。 假设您已有一个配置文件，比如名为\`config.yaml\`，并且您要将\`TRAIN.LR\`从某一个值（比如0.0001）调整为0.000005，那么您应该先在\`config.yaml\`文件中做如下修改： \`\`\`yaml TRAIN: LR: 0.000005 # 其他配置保持不变 \`\`\` 一旦调整了配置文件，您需要使用\`update_config_from_file\`函数来加载这个配置文件，并用其更新当前的配置\`cfg\`。这个过程通常发生在训练脚本的开始部分，即在实际开始训练之前。以下是如何在Python脚本中完成这个操作的范例： \`\`\`python # 假设config.yaml是您已经修改了LR的配置文件 config_filename = \\"config.yaml\\" update_config_from_file(config_filename) # 现在cfg已经被更新，可以用它来进行训练 \`\`\` 确保在开始训练之前调用上述代码，这样可以确保配置中的学习率调整得以正确应用到训练过程中。 如果您是在一个持续的训练过程中并希望动态调整学习率，那么可能需要直接在训练循环中修改优化器的学习率。这通常涉及到访问优化器对象，并动态调整其参数值。但根据您提供的代码和信息，看起来您是通过配置文件来管理学习率的，因此，请确保通过正确编辑和加载配置文件来实现这一目标。"},{"prompt":"在DATA: MAX_SAMPLE_INTERVAL: 100 MEAN: -

Есть ли возможность","completion":"Для определения того, через какой IP-адрес работает ваш Telegram бот, можно воспользоваться следующими методами: # 1. Прямая проверка через API Если ваш бот написан на одном из популярных языков программирования, например на Python, и использует библиотеку для работы с Telegram API (например, python-telegram-bot или pyTelegramBotAPI), вы можете отправить запрос на внешний сервис для проверки IP. Существуют различные сервисы, позволяющие получить текущий внешний IP, например httpbin.org. Пример получения IP в Python: \`\`\`python import requests def get_my_ip(): response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip') return response.json()['origin'] print(get_my_ip()) \`\`\` # 2. Использование логов Если ваш бот работает на сервере, в зависимости от конфигурации и окружения, в логах самой системы или логах сетевого взаимодействия может быть информация о соединениях, в том числе и используемые IP адреса. # 3. Манипуляции с сетью на уровне ОС В зависимости от вашей конфигурации системы, вы можете настроить маршрутизацию (routing) трафика отдельных приложений через определённый сетевой интерфейс или IP. Например, на Linux это можно делать с помощью \`iptables\` и \`ip route\`. # Определение через внешние сервисы Другой способ — использовать внешние сервисы, такие как площадки для вебхуков (например, webhook.site), чтобы увидеть, с какого IP пришел запрос. Вы можете временно настроить вашего бота на отправку запросов к таким сервисам, чтобы увидеть используемый IP. # Проверка через VPN Судя по вашей конфигурации, один из интерфейсов принадлежит VPN (ProtonVPN). Если ваш бот использует этот VPN для своей работы, то исходящий IP будет соответствовать IP адресу, предоставленному VPN сервисом. Конкретный IP можно проверить через сервисы типа httpbin.org, как показано выше. # Примечание Выбор метода зависит от возможностей вашего сервера, используемых технологий и предпочтений в управлении ботом. Если нужно гарантировать работу бота через конкретный IP (например, через VPN), вам нужно быть уверенным в правильной настройке сетевого трафика вашей системы."},{"prompt":"Привет!

User2: I would have to say that The Next Step seems to be really popular at the moment. It has a big fan base and always gets a lot of views. User1: Yeah, I agree. It’s definitely a hit with the viewers. But what about shows that aren’t doing so well? User2: I think Remotely Funny hasn’t been getting as much attention as some of the other shows. It’s a fun show, but it just doesn’t seem to be catching on with the audience. User1: And what about the shows that are just surviving on the schedule? User2: I’d say Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed is one of those shows that’s just comfortably hanging in there. It’s not the most popular, but it has its loyal viewers who tune in regularly. User1: It’s interesting to see how different shows are faring on the channel. I wonder if CBBC will make any changes based on the popularity of certain shows. Write a forum convo about the early morning only shows, and one of them is doing pretty good for a forgotten cartoon that only airs first thing User1: Have you noticed how well Skunk Fu is doing as one of the early morning only shows on CBBC? User2: Yes, it’s actually surprising how popular it has become considering it only airs first thing in the morning. It seems to have gained a new following among viewers. User1: That’s great to hear! It’s always nice to see a forgotten cartoon do well and find a new audience. I hope CBBC continues to showcase these early morning gems. Write a Wikipedia page set in May 2016 with current programming (with the year it originally debuted on the channel, and if a show has left for a period, then the year it returned will appear next to it, by the way its still part of this scenario) CBBC (Children’s BBC) is a British children’s television channel owned and operated by the BBC.

They showcased logos of 10 current shows, and there's a hint that Phineas and Ferb (P&F) is coming soon to the channel. But one show really surprised me. User2: Wait, P&F is coming to CBBC? That's amazing news! But now you've got me curious. Which show surprised you in the trailer? User1: Okay, hold onto your hats, because they included a logo for \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" in the trailer. Yes, that \\"Adventures of Tintin\\"! Considering it hasn't aired new episodes in YEARS, I was totally taken aback. User2: \\"Adventures of Tintin\\"?! No way, that's a blast from the past! I can't believe they're bringing it back. Did the trailer say anything about new episodes, or are they just rerunning the classic ones? User1: The trailer didn’t specify, unfortunately. All it showed was the logo among the other shows airing this year. It looks like we'll have to keep our eyes peeled for more news on this. If they are new episodes, that would be absolutely incredible. User2: Seriously, this is the best news I've heard all day! \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" used to be my favorite show.

Really no surprise there. 2. **Horrible Histories** – Always a hit. Their unique take on history is both educational and hilarious. 3. **Operation Ouch!** – With the amount of love this show gets for its fun and fascinating look at the human body and medicine, it’s a shoo-in. 4. **Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed** – The misadventures continue. This show has a solid fan base. 5. **Blue Peter** – It’s historic at this point. No CBBC lineup would feel right without it. 6. **Hetty Feather** – The dramatic adventures based on the Jacqueline Wilson book have been a hit. 7. **Shaun the Sheep** – Aardman’s genius at work. It’s timeless and appeals to pretty much everyone. 8. **So Awkward** – That awkward teenage life resonates well, it seems! 9. **The Deep** - This one's for the adventure seekers who love the mysteries of the deep sea. 10. **Adventures of Tintin** – As we’ve already discussed. It’s making a return, and it’s the biggest surprise of them all! And, of course, they teased that **Phineas and Ferb** is coming soon, which is super exciting. Can't wait to see how they integrate it into the current lineup. It looks like CBBC is going all out this year! User2: Wow, that's an impressive lineup!

It looks like CBBC is really shaking things up and maybe trying to bring more family viewing into the evening schedule. **Operation Ouch!** has a broad appeal, so it makes sense. Plus, with such a diverse lineup leading up to it, the channel is setting a nice pace for viewers throughout the day. User2: True, it's a smart move.

Where did Shaun the Sheep go? It's usually a staple in the morning lineup, but I can't find it in the evening slots either. User2: That's a good catch. Shaun the Sheep has been a beloved show on CBBC for years. It's odd not seeing it on the schedule at all, especially when they're extending programming to 9pm. User1: Yeah, exactly. It's one of those shows that's perfect for winding down in the evening or starting your day with a laugh in the morning. I wonder why it would be left off the schedule entirely. Maybe it's just for June 21st? User2: Could be. There might be a special event or marathon of another show that day which caused a few regulars like Shaun the Sheep to be temporarily bumped. Or perhaps they're shifting around the programming to accommodate new shows or test new time slots for others. User1: That makes sense. I hope it's just a one-day thing. Shaun the Sheep has a way of bringing a smile to people's faces, no matter what age. Would be a shame to lose that from the daily lineup. User2: Agreed.

User1: Yeah, Skunk Fu had its niche audience for sure. It's always tough to see a show go, especially one that's been part of the early morning routine. It had a good run, but I guess the programming team must have their reasons for the change. User2: True, everything comes to an end at some point. And with the channel expanding its evening slots, it's only natural some shows would be shuffled around or phased out to make room for new content. Hopefully, Skunk Fu fans will find something else in the lineup to enjoy. User1: Absolutely. With Phineas and Ferb joining the schedule and other shows moving around, there's still lots to look forward to. CBBC knows how to keep their programming fresh and engaging.

As a parent overseeing the content my children engage with, I've come to appreciate the variety and quality of shows offered on your channel. However, I've recently noticed the absence of \\"Skunk Fu\\" from your schedule, a show that my children, especially the youngest, have grown quite fond of. It felt like a safe and entertaining choice for them, encouraging creativity and offering valuable lessons through its storytelling. Could you please provide information regarding the removal of \\"Skunk Fu\\" from your programming? Will it be returning any time soon, or has it been discontinued permanently? If so, my child would be quite disappointed, and I would appreciate any recommendations for similar content available on CBBC that could serve as suitable alternatives. Thank you for your time and assistance. Looking forward to your response. Warm regards, [Your Name] --- Dear [Your Name], Thank you for reaching out to us at CBBC and for your kind words about our programming. We understand that changes to our schedule can be disappointing, especially when it involves a show as enjoyed as \\"Skunk Fu.\\" We strive to offer a diverse and dynamic range of programming that can cater to the varied interests of our young audiences. To clarify, \\"Skunk Fu\\" has been removed from our current broadcasting schedule and, as of now, there are no immediate plans for its return. We regularly review our lineup to keep it fresh and engaging, thus making way for new content and giving other shows a platform. While we know this might be sad news, we’re eager to suggest a few alternatives that we believe might equally capture your child's imagination and interest: 1. **Phineas and Ferb** – An inventive and amusing show that encourages creativity and problem-solving, with plenty of humor and adventure to keep the whole family entertained. 2. **Shaun the Sheep** – A delightful and cleverly crafted series that, much like \\"Skunk Fu,\\" delivers silent comedy through its charming characters and storytelling. 3. **Danger Mouse** – Full of action and humor, this animated series offers exciting adventures that can captivate fans of animated heroics. 4. **Horrible Histories** – A fun way to learn about history with a twist, presenting historical facts in a humorous and accessible way for children. 5. **Blue Peter** – The longest-running children’s TV show in the world that includes a variety of segments ranging from arts and crafts to environmental projects and competitions, encouraging participation and creativity. We hope these suggestions provide your family with new favorites to enjoy together. We greatly value feedback from our viewers, and your comments have been noted for consideration in our future programming decisions. Thank you once again for your support of CBBC.

As if on cue, Phineas Flynn bounded outside, his ever-present optimism shining as bright as the day itself. \\"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!\\" Phineas exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with the thrill of a new idea. Ferb, his silent but expressive stepbrother, raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Nearby, Perry the Platypus watched quietly, disguised in his pet persona. Little did the boys know, Perry was also Agent P, a secret agent assigned to thwart the schemes of the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz. The Invention Today's project was ambitious even by Phineas and Ferb's standards: they decided to create a device capable of translating animal thoughts into human speech. \\"Just think, Ferb! We could finally understand what Perry's thinking!\\" Phineas said excitedly. Little did Phineas and Ferb know, their invention would come perilously close to uncovering Perry's secret life as an agent. Perry's Predicament As the brothers got to work, Perry slipped away to receive his mission from Major Monogram. Dr. Doofenshmirtz had been unusually quiet, and Perry needed to investigate. With a salute, Perry headed out, his mind on his mission but his heart caught in worry about the boys' latest invention. The Almost-Reveal After a day of typical Phineas and Ferb-style engineering involving improbable physics, musical numbers, and help from their friends, the device was finally ready. As they aimed it at Perry, who had just returned from thwarting another one of Dr. Doofenshmirtz's plans, the machine sprang to life. Perry, realizing the potential disaster, quickly grabbed a squeaky toy and began to play, hoping the device would only translate those simple desires of a platypus. The machine crackled to life, and Perry's \\"thoughts\\" were broadcast: \\"Squeak, squeak. More toys, please!\\" Phineas and Ferb laughed. \\"Classic Perry, always thinking about playing,\\" Phineas said. Unbeknownst to them, Perry had narrowly avoided revealing his secret identity. The Unexpected Turn Just as they were about to try the machine on other animals, Candace, looking to bust her brothers, accidentally destroyed the device in her typical clumsy fashion while trying to show it to their mom. The machine sputtered and went silent, taking its secrets along with it. \\"Perry the Platypus, you've saved your secret once more,\\" Perry thought to himself, breathing a sigh of relief. Conclusion In the end, Phineas and Ferb were undeterred, already dreaming up their next big project. Perry, reassured that his secret was safe, settled back into his role as the family pet. The day had come incredibly close to changing everything for Perry, Phineas, and Ferb, but as always, the status quo was restored, ready for the next day's adventure. And so, the sun set over Danville, closing another chapter in the endless summer of Phineas and Ferb, with Perry the Platypus' secret safe for one more day."},{"prompt":"Напиши вводный текст, в котором будет сказано, что многие используют старые версии операционных систем, но нужно уточнить, что операционные системы это программное обеспечение","completion":"В современном цифровом мире операционные системы действуют как фундаментальная основа для работы наших компьютеров и мобильных устройств.

原先的\`EPOCH: 50\`需要改为\`60\`来包括额外的10个epoch。 2. **调整学习率下降点（LR_DROP_EPOCH）：** - 如果原计划在第30个epoch降低学习率，而新增的训练周期要求降低学习率以避免过拟合，你可能需要在更合适的时机调整学习率下降点。一个策略是设定第40或50个epoch降低学习率，以便给新增的epochs一个更低的初始学习率。具体取决于你的监测情况和策略，你可能需要调整\`LR_DROP_EPOCH\`的值或者采用更灵活的学习率调度策略。考虑到你目前情况，建议在第40或50个epoch降低学习率，即\`LR_DROP_EPOCH: 40\`或\`50\`。 3. **更灵活的学习率调度策略（可选）：** - 当前配置文件使用的是step调度器。考虑到你的特殊需求，你可以考虑改用\`Mstep\`调度器，并设置合适的里程碑。例如，你可以考虑： \`\`\`yaml SCHEDULER: TYPE: Mstep MILESTONES: [30, 50] GAMMA: 0.1 \`\`\` 这样，在第30个和第50个epoch后，学习率会分别按比例下降。 4. **对于AMP的考虑（可选）：** - 你配置文件中\`AMP: False\`表示没有启用自动混合精度(Automatic Mixed Precision)。根据你的设备和框架支持情况，启用AMP可能会帮助你更高效地利用GPU资源并可能获得更快的训练速度。当然，这与过拟合直接相关性不大，但对加速训练有益。 确保在进行这些修改后，重新评估模型在验证集上的表现，以确保这些调整达到了预期的效果。调整训练配置是一个试误和迭代的过程，需要根据训练过程中实时监测的数据来不断优化。"},{"prompt":"Mstep和step有什么区别？","completion":"\`Mstep\`和\`step\`都是学习率调度器（Learning Rate Scheduler），它们用于在训练深度学习模型过程中按照一定规则调整学习率，但它们调整学习率的方式存在差异。 # Step Scheduler（步进调度器） - **概念**：Step Scheduler在预定义的每个步长（或称为epoch数）减少学习率，通常是固定的比例。比如，每20个epoch降低学习率到原来的0.1倍。 - **用途**：适用于当你已经知道大约需要多少时间训练会达到某种效果，并想在特定时间点减小学习步长以微调模型。 - **示例**： \`\`\`yaml SCHEDULER: TYPE: step STEP_SIZE: 20 # 每20个epochs DECAY_RATE: 0.1 # 学习率乘以0.1 \`\`\` # MultiStepLR Scheduler（多步长调度器） - **概念**：\`Mstep\`或通常称作\`MultiStepLR\`，与Step Scheduler类似，但允许在多个预定义的epoch降低学习率，而不是每隔固定数量的epoch进行一次。这意味着你可以设定一个epoch的列表，在列表中的每个epoch时，学习率会按给定的因子减少。 - **用途**：当你希望在训练过程中在不同的点进一步调整学习率时很有用。例如，如果你知道模型训练在某几个关键点时可能会受益于较小的学习率。 - **示例**： \`\`\`yaml SCHEDULER: TYPE: Mstep # 或MultiStepLR MILESTONES: [30, 50] # 在第30和第50个epoch GAMMA: 0.1 # 每次减少到原来的比例 \`\`\` 总之，两者的主要区别在于调整学习率的灵活性。Step Scheduler适合于在固定频率上调整学习率，而MultiStepLR Scheduler提供了更大的灵活性，允许在训练的不同阶段按需调整学习率。选择哪一种调度器通常取决于对你的实验或模型训练进程的理解以及你的具体需求。"},{"prompt":"如果我们只训练50个epoch，那么mstep是不是和step一样？","completion":"如果你只训练50个epoch，并且在\`Mstep\`（或\`MultiStepLR\`）和\`step\`调度器中设置的参数导致学习率变化的时间节点完全一样，那么在实际效果上它们可以表现得非常相似。但是，从严格意义上讲，它们在设计和灵活性上仍有区别。 # 相同配置下的比较： Step Scheduler： - 假定你设置\`STEP_SIZE\`为25，\`DECAY_RATE\`为0.1，这意味着每过25个epochs，学习率会乘以0.1。 - 如果你只训练50个epochs，那么在第25个epoch学习率会下调一次。 MultiStepLR Scheduler： - 假定你设置\`MILESTONES\`为[25]，\`GAMMA\`为0.1，这意味着在25个epoch处，学习率会乘以0.1。 -

In particular, solar radiation, household income, home ownership, race/ethnicity, the urban-rural divide, political ideology, and environmental attitudes are found to be associated with residential PV adoption rates based on cross-sectional data.5,11–18 Disadvantaged communities are found to not only have less existing PV adoption but also tend to have less PV hosting capacity on the local distribution grid that may hinder future PV installations.19 CONTEXT & SCALE Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are being deployed at a rapid yet non-uniform pace. To explain this heterogeneity across space and time, we applied computer vision to historical satellite and aerial images and constructed a spatiotemporal dataset of PV deployment in the United States. We analyzed the data using a technology diffusion model and found that low-income communities are not only delayed in their PV adoption onset but also saturate more quickly at lower levels. We also found that certain types of incentives are associated with a high saturated adoption level in low-income communities, whereas other types are not. The computer vision model we developed can be scaled to any location on Earth where historical aerial or satellite images are available at a sufficient resolution. Additionally, we make our dataset publicly available as a resource for researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to understand PV adoption dynamics and customize policy design. Joule 6, 2611–2625, November 16, 2022 ª 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. 2611 l Leveraging longitudinal PV installation data, some previous studies have developed spatiotemporal models to characterize PV diffusion,20,21 capture neighborhood effects,22–25 and evaluate intervention effects of incentive programs.26,27 In this study, we construct a spatiotemporal PV deployment dataset using computer vision and leverage it to characterize the non-linear dynamics of PV adoption across communities in the United States at a fine resolution yet large scale. Although a majority of longitudinal studies have sought to model the speed of diffusion across different places, they do not represent the full life cycle of technology adoption from onset to saturation. As a result, such approaches are unable to differentiate between communities with low overall PV adoption throughout the life cycle and communities that are delayed in adoption onset but are likely to catch up later. Moreover, they cannot capture the non-linear dynamics of PV adoption and delineate the deceleration and saturation stages of the adoption for maturing technologies. Parameterizing adoption trajectories and identifying the adoption phase of each community from the technology adoption life cycle perspective28,29 can help us better reveal the adoption process beyond steady growth trends, understand the factors that shape PV adoption, and provide insights for customizing adoption stage-specific policies. To date, only a few studies have applied technology diffusion models, such as the Bass model, to fit adoption curves of PVs at a highly aggregated geographic level (e.g., country, state).30–32 These studies, however, cannot explore PV adoption trajectories at a fine enough resolution due to coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the data, limiting their insight into the socioeconomic heterogeneity of adoption processes within and across different communities. Existing datasets of PV installations are either not comprehensive in geographical scope, not sufficiently granular—from both spatial and temporal perspectives—or not publicly accessible to enable such analysis of PV adoption at a national, or wider, scale. We address this gap by: (1) constructing a spatially and temporally resolved largescale PV deployment dataset in an automated, scalable, and non-intrusive manner and (2) uncovering how PV adoption from onset to saturation is shaped by socioeconomic factors. In particular, we develop a computer vision model to identify PV panels in historical aerial and satellite imagery and use it to construct a spatiotemporal dataset of PV installations across the United States, including their geolocation and the installation year. Our dataset covers PV systems installed between 2006 and 2017 in 420 counties across 46 states in the United States. These counties are randomly sampled from strata delineated by the average number of PV installations per 1,000 households in a county. Compared with conventional data collection methods relying on the contribution of state agencies, utilities, or incentive programs,33,34 this automated method can be applied to different places on Earth where historical aerial and satellite images are available at a sufficient resolution (%1 m). As a consequence, our approach can reduce the dependency on third-party data contributions and avoid an under-representation of communities without registration and reporting systems for PV installations. Moreover, our approach can be used to update installation information using newly available imagery without additional retooling of the framework. The computer vision model and dataset applied in this study are made publicly available to enable researchers and other stakeholders to further uncover and understand PV adoption patterns across time. Using our dataset of PV installations, we apply the Bass model28 as a descriptive model to parameterize adoption trajectories and identify adoption phases at a 1Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 2Department of Economics, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 Mu ̈ nchen, Germany 3Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 4Department of Energy Science & Engineering, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 5Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 6Lead contact *Correspondence: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> (A.M.), <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> (R.R.) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.09.011 ll 2612 Joule 6, 2611–2625, November 16, 2022 Articl spatially resolved level defined by US census block groups. We extract the key parameters describing each adoption trajectory, especially the time of adoption onset and the saturated adoption level of each block group. Using our results, we find that as of 2016, 55% of the block groups analyzed have not started the adoption process, whereas 15% have already reached saturation. On an average, high-income block groups started adopting PV earlier and tend to saturate, if there is no change in policy regime, at a higher level than low-income block groups. Moreover, the PV benefit with rebate/grant—defined as the difference between the retail rate of electricity and the levelized cost of PV after the subsidization of rebate or grant—is found to be positively associated with both earlier adoption onset and higher saturated adoption level. Although PV benefit is more relevant for low-income communities, we observe lower PV benefit after the subsidization of rebate or grant in these communities on average, potentially amplifying income disparities in PV adoption. We also find that performance-based incentives (PBI), property tax incentives (PTI), and rebate programs are positively associated with saturated adoption levels, among which PBI is particularly relevant in lower-income communities. Our study illustrates the value of computer vision methods in revealing granular solar adoption trends at a large scale and customizing policies and investment based on the current adoption stage across the entire adoption life cycle.以此为内容拟一个论文题目，不要有波折号","completion":"\\"解锁美国居民光伏采纳的时空模式：计算机视觉与大数据分析\\""},{"prompt":"不好，要包括卫星图像，光伏","completion":"\\"基于卫星图像的美国光伏系统部署动态研究：计算机视觉与社经影响分析\\""},{"prompt":"基于卫星图像的美国光伏系统部署动态研究这个有点空","completion":"\\"卫星图像揭示的美国光伏装置部署趋势与社会经济因素分析\\""},{"prompt":"显得像学术论文一样","completion":"\\"利用卫星图像分析美国光伏系统部署的社会经济动态：一项计算机视觉研究\\""},{"prompt":"基于卫星图像的分布式光伏系统时空信息获取换一个高端一点的用作毕业论文","completion":"\\"卫星图像技术在分布式光伏系统时空特征分析中的高级应用研究\\""},{"prompt":"基于卫星图像的分布式光伏系统时空特征分析 基于卫星图像的分布式光伏系统时空动态部署研究 基于卫星图像识别的分布式光伏出力预测研究 围绕这些要素起一个论文标题用于学术发表","completion":"\\"卫星图像识别技术在分布式光伏系统时空特性与动态部署预测中的应用研究\\""},{"prompt":"在全球“双碳”背景之下，全面、准确地获得区域光伏信息，是光伏监管和能源行业潜力评估的基础。本项目利用开源卫星图像数据集进行区域光伏阵列动态时空信息获取并分析。项目基于计算机视觉技术将大规模卫星图像数据进行语义分割，从而获得区域光伏地理位置信息，并在像素尺度实现光伏发电量估计。同时，项目利用区域历史卫星图像信息开展光伏系统安装年份辨识研究，结合光伏地理、年份、容量等信息，项目构建光伏安装的扩散模型，并对构建模型进行验证与优化，最终实现对区域分布式光伏增长趋势的准确预测。围绕该内容写一份研究目的","completion":"本研究旨在应对全球\\"双碳\\"目标背景下，对区域光伏信息获取的迫切需求，提高光伏监管效率和能源行业的发展潜力评估准确性。通过利用开源卫星图像数据集，本项目开展区域光伏阵列的动态时空信息获取与分析，旨在突破传统光伏数据收集方法的局限性。采用先进的计算机视觉技术，对大规模卫星图像数据进行语义分割，准确获取区域内光伏装置的地理位置信息，进一步实现在像素尺度上对光伏发电量的精确估计。本项目不仅关注光伏系统的地理和容量信息，还致力于通过分析历史卫星图像，识别光伏系统的安装年份，进而构建并优化一种新型的光伏安装扩散模型。该模型结合了光伏地理位置、安装年份及容量等多维数据，旨在提高对区域分布式光伏增长趋势的预测准确性。通过本研究，期望为促进可再生能源特别是太阳能在全球能源结构中的更有效利用与布局提供有力的技术支撑和决策依据。"},{"prompt":"写一下对光伏动态（时间）了解的重要性","completion":"对光伏系统的动态（时间）了解至关重要，这主要体现在以下几个方面： 1. **规划和发展决策支持**：光伏行业的快速发展要求决策者对现有和未来光伏发电的潜力有清晰的认识。通过了解光伏系统的动态发展情况，政策制定者和能源规划者可以更有效地制定政策、规划光伏项目的布局，以及优化能源结构，推动能源转型。 2. **效能和潜力评估**：光伏技术的时间性分析可以揭示其在不同时间尺度上的发电效能和潜力。例如，通过分析光伏系统随时间的安装增长和性能变化，可以评估特定地区或系统的长期效率和可靠性，为光伏投资和维护提供依据。 3. **市场动态和趋势预测**：对光伏装置安装时间的了解有助于分析市场趋势、预测未来发展方向，辅助企业制定战略规划。了解历史和当前的光伏部署动态对于预测未来市场需求、技术进步以及价格变化尤为关键。 4. **政策效果评价**：从时间维度分析光伏项目的增减，可以用来评估政策和激励措施的效果。如光伏补贴、税收优惠等政策对光伏系统部署速率的影响，以及这些政策在不同时间段的有效性。 5. **环境和社会影响**：时间动态分析有助于评估光伏系统对环境的积极影响，例如减少二氧化碳排放、促进能源结构绿色转型等。此外，还可以从社会经济角度分析光伏发展对不同人群和地区的影响，从而促进能源公正和可持续发展。 6. **响应能源需求变化**：随着社会经济的发展和居民生活水平的提升，能源需求呈现出动态变化的特点。了解并分析光伏系统的时间特征，对于调整能源供应结构、优化发电计划、保障能源安全具有重要作用。 综上所述，从时间维度深入理解光伏系统的动态变化，对于促进光伏行业健康可持续发展，实现高效、平衡的能源供需，以及应对全球气候变化等具有重要意义。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

State railroads are state capitalism. On the basis of state subsidies, certain industries are said to represent state capitalism. Post-colonial state-led capitalist development is often called state capitalism. ‘And the entire nationalized and plan-directed Soviet economy is supposedly also state capitalism [no matter that it was “the result of a revolution”]’ (Trotsky, 1979: 340). The term ‘state capitalism’ originally arose to designate all the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises. The very necessity of such measures is one of the signs that the productive forces have outgrown capitalism and are bringing it to a partial self-negation in practice. (Trotsky, 1991: 208) As indicated already, capitalism itself creates conditions for state’s economic involvement: Monopoly capitalism has long since outgrown the private ownership of the means of production and the boundaries of the national state. Paralyzed, however, by its own organizations, the working class was unable to free in time the productive forces of society from their capitalist fetters. Hence arises the protracted epoch of economic and political convulsions. The productive forces pound against the barriers of private property and of national boundaries [that are defended by the state]. The bourgeois governments are obliged to pacify the mutiny of their own productive forces with a police club. This is what constitutes the so-called planned economy. Insofar as the state attempts to harness and discipline capitalist anarchy, it may be called conditionally ‘state capitalism.’ (Trotsky, 1933) [U]nder state capitalism, in the strict sense of the word, we must understand the management of industrial and other enterprises by the bourgeois state on its own account, or the ‘regulating’ intervention of the bourgeois state into the workings of private capitalist enterprises. (ibid.) One has to adequately distinguish between state capitalism and state-ism, from the standpoint of property relations or class relations. There are undoubtedly points of contact between state capitalism and ‘state-ism’, but taken as systems they are opposite rather than identical. State capitalism means the substitution of state property for private property, and for that very reason remains partial in character. State-ism . . . means state intervention on the basis of private property, and with the goal of preserving it. Whatever be the programs of the government, stateism inevitably leads to a transfer of the damages of the decaying system from strong shoulders to weak. It ‘rescues’ the small proprietor from complete ruin only to the extent that his existence is necessary for the preservation of big property. The planned measures of stateism are dictated not by the demands of a development of the productive forces, but by a concern for the preservation of private property at the expense of the productive forces, which are in revolt against it. State-ism means applying brakes to the development of technique, supporting unviable enterprises, perpetuating parasitic social strata. In a word, state-ism is completely reactionary in character. (Trotsky, 1991: 209) Thus, the capitalist state can acquire attributes of ‘state-capitalists’, with state-managers effectively acting like capitalists.36 Fourthly, the state under neoliberalism is fundamentally capitalist in character. Given the usual portrayal of the state as neoliberal state in many circles, it is difficult to believe that the state is so closely linked to the businesses. Neo-liberalism is the modern form of laissez-faire economy. And ‘laissez-faire too is a form of state “regulation”, introduced and maintained by legislative and coercive means. It is a deliberate policy, conscious of its own ends, and not the spontaneous, automatic expression of economic facts’ (Gramsci, 1971: 160). The neoliberal form of the state, just like the state as such, is connected to each phase of the capitalist circuit. Fifthly, the capitalist state is a contradiction-ridden personification of illusory common interests. About the capitalist, Marx says, ‘[H]e is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital’ (Marx, 1887: 163). ‘As the conscious representative of this movement [advancing money to make more money], the possessor of money becomes a capitalist’ (ibid.: 107). And the capitalist sees labour as a personification as well: from the standpoint of capital, ‘The worker is here nothing more than personified labour-time’ (ibid.: 168). Even labour has developed a habit of seeing things this way. And the state, the personification of illusory interests, supports both forms of personification, capital’s as well as labour’s. These forms are contradictory: capital wants people to work longer while labour wants to work shorter hours. That contradiction is represented in the heart of the state, which is partly represented in state legislation to shorten the working day under pressure from workers. Excessively long working days ‘called forth a control on the part of Society which legally limits, regulates, and makes uniform the working-day and its pauses’ (ibid.: 194). But state legislation makes numerous concessions to capital. The state sometimes prolongs the working day and sometimes restricts it. The freely exchanged commodities are produced by workers who do not receive the full value of what they produce. The money with which the commodity labour power is bought today is, ultimately, the form of unpaid labour appropriated from workers yesterday, and therefore it properly belongs to workers. The equality and freedom that the capitalist state ‘protects’ (the idea that all commodity owners are equal and that workers are free to work for whoever they wish to) are the capitalist form of equality and freedom within the sphere of exchange relations. Such equality and freedom are transformed into their opposites, i.e. inequality and unfreedom, within the sphere of property relations and production relations. In fact, and as mentioned earlier, even in exchange relations, there are inequality and unfreedom. This is because: (a) workers are not free not to work for the capitalist class as a whole, a fact which the state as the state of the capitalist class as a whole absolutely cannot do anything about, and (b) often millions of workers do not get a wage that conforms to the value of labour power, and millions are not free to work for whoever they wish to, the facts which the state can do something but often fails to, because it works in the interests of specific capitalists who may be politically and/or economically important and who benefit from such a regime of low wages and unfreedom. A legal system that corresponds to social relations where there are equal com-modity producers can only support inequalities or injustice under capitalism: workers lack control over production and over the fruits of their labour. The state becomes a contradictory entity because the world of equality and freedom contradicts the world of unfreedom and inequality. While labour and capital are commodity owners, equal and free in the eyes of law, it is the case that underlying the freedom and equality in commodity exchange is the appropriation of unpaid labour from sellers-cum-owners of commodity labour power. The state supports such an unjust system. The state ensures conditions that produce sub-stantial inequality (one between capital and labour, and between big business and small-scale producers). Given the exploitative nature of capitalist property rights defended by the state, it is futile to think about social justice, in the Proudhon style, on the basis of merely ‘the juridical relations that correspond to the production of commodities’ (Marx, 1887: 64) and on the basis of the idea that ‘the production of commodities [by small-scale producers] is a form of production as everlasting as justice’ (ibid.). Sixthly, the state plays an immense role in the reproduction of capitalism, and yet the state in capitalism is not the main cause of people’s economic and other problems or indeed of the class relations as such. Marx (1847) says: [I]f the bourgeoisie is politically, that is, by its state power, ‘maintaining injustice in property relations’, it is not creating it. The ‘injustice in property relations’ which is determined by the modern division of labour, the modern form of exchange, competition, concentration, etc., by no means arises from the political rule of the bourgeois class, but vice versa, the political rule of the bourgeois class arises from these modern relations of production which bourgeois economists proclaim to be necessary and eternal laws. Engels presented two views (Marxist and anarchist). Theoretically speaking, the anarchist view (e.g. Bakunin) is that ‘it is the state which has created capital, that the capitalist has his capital only by favour of the state’, while in the Marxist view, ‘state power is nothing more than the organisation with which the ruling classes, landlords and capitalists have provided themselves in order to protect their social prerogatives’ (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 257). In the Marxist view, as we have seen, capitalism does not exist because of the capitalist state but the capitalist state exists because of capitalism, which then makes use of it. As often is the case, these contrasting theoretical views are translated into contrasting political differences. This is the case even if Marxism and anarchism are united in that they hope to see a society without class and the state. For anarchism, Engels continues, ‘the state is the chief evil, it is above all the state which must be done away with and then capitalism will go to hell of itself ’ (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 257). But Marxists think differently. Engels speaks for Marxists when says:”翻译为中文","completion":"首先，在前述关于国家与资本循环关系的讨论中，反思国家资本主义的概念似乎很有用。人们使用“国家资本主义”这个术语时，并没有明确其具体含义。国家铁路是国家资本主义的一种形式。在国家补贴的基础上，某些产业被认为代表了国家资本主义。后殖民时期由国家主导的资本主义发展经常被称为国家资本主义。“整个国有化和计划指导下的苏联经济，据说也是国家资本主义[不管它是‘革命的结果’]”（托洛茨基，1979年：340页）。 “国家资本主义”这一术语最初是用来指代资产阶级国家直接管理运输手段或工业企业时出现的各种现象。这种措施的必要性本身就是生产力超越了资本主义并在实践中部分自我否定的标志之一。 （托洛茨基，1991年：208页） 正如已经指出的，资本主义本身为国家的经济参与创造了条件： 垄断资本主义早已超出了生产资料的私人所有权和国家界限。然而，由于被其自身的组织所束缚，工人阶级未能及时将社会生产力从资本主义的桎梏中解放出来。因此出现了长时间的经济和政治动荡时代。生产力冲击着私有财产的障碍和国家边界[这些边界得到国家的捍卫]。资产阶级政府被迫用警棍平息其自身生产力的叛乱。这就是所谓的计划经济。在国家试图驾驭和规范资本主义的无政府状态时，它可以被有条件地称为“国家资本主义”。 （托洛茨基，1933年） 在严格意义上讲，“国家资本主义”应当理解为资产阶级国家自行管理工业和其他企业，或者资产阶级国家对私人资本主义企业的作业进行“调节性”干预。 （同上） 必须从财产关系或阶级关系的角度，恰当地区分国家资本主义和国家干预主义。 无疑，国家资本主义与“国家干预主义”之间有接触点，但作为系统，它们是相反而非相同的。“国家资本主义”意味着国家财产替代私人财产，在这个意义上它仍具有局部性质。“国家干预主义”......意味着在私人财产基础上的国家干预，目的是为了保护私人财产。不管政府的计划是什么，“国家干预主义”不可避免地导致将衰败系统的损害从强者转移到弱者身上。它只在小业主的存在对于保护大财产是必要的程度上“拯救”小业主免于彻底的破产。“国家干预主义”的计划措施不是由生产力发展的需求所决定，而是出于对私人财产保护的关切，以牺牲反抗它的生产力为代价。“国家干预主义”意味着给技术发展踩刹车，支持无法生存的企业，维持寄生的社会阶层。总之，“国家干预主义”在性质上是完全反动的。 （托洛茨基，1991年：209页） 因此，资本主义国家可以获得“国家资本主义”的属性，国家管理者实际上就像资本家一样行事。 其次，在新自由主义下的国家根本上是资本主义的。鉴于在许多圈子里通常将国家描述为新自由主义国家，很难相信国家与企业如此紧密相关。新自由主义是自由放任经济的现代形式。“自由放任也是一种国家‘规制’形式，通过立法和强制手段引入和维持。这是一项有意识的政策，知晓其自身目的，而不是经济事实的自发、自动表达”（格拉姆西，1971年：160页）。新自由主义形态的国家，就像国家本身一样，与资本主义循环的每个阶段都有联系。 第五，资本主义国家是矛盾重重的、充满虚幻共同利益的体现。关于资本家，马克思说，“他只是资本的化身。他的灵魂是资本的灵魂”（马克思，1887年：163页）。作为这一运动的有意识代表（用金钱来赚取更多金钱），金钱的持有者成为资本家（同上：107页）。资本家也把劳动力视为一种化身：从资本的角度看，“工人在这里不过是劳动时间的化身”（同上：168页）。即使是劳动力也已习惯了这种看法。国家，作为虚幻利益的化身，支持资本和劳动两种形式的化身。这些形式是矛盾的：资本想要人们工作时间更长，而劳动力想要工作时间更短。这种矛盾体现在国家的核心，部分体现在国家立法中，在工人的压力下缩短工作日。过长的工作日“引起了社会的控制，法律上限制、规范和统一了工作日及其休息时间”（同上：194页）。但国家立法对资本做了许多让步。国家有时延长工作日，有时限制它。 自由交换的商品由工人生产，这些工人没有获得他们所生产的全部价值。用来购买劳动力商品的金钱，归根结底，是从昨天的工人那里剥削来的未付劳动的形式，因此它实际上属于工人。资本主义国家“保护”的平等与自由（所有商品拥有者平等，工人自由选择为谁工作的观念）是交换关系领域内的资本主义形式的平等与自由。这种平等与自由在财产关系和生产关系领域内转变为其反面，即不平等和不自由。事实上，正如前面提到的，即使在交换关系中，也存在不平等和不自由。这是因为：（a）工人没有不为整个资本家阶级工作的自由，这是国家作为资本家阶级整体的国家根本无法做到的事情；（b）往往有数以百万计的工人得不到与劳动力价值相符的工资，数以百万计的人没有自由选择为谁工作的自由，这些事实国家可以做些什么，但通常未能做到，因为它在特定政治和/或经济上重要的资本家的利益下工作，而这些资本家从低工资和不自由的制度中获益。 与存在平等的商品生产者的社会关系相对应的法律体系，在资本主义下只能支持不平等或不公正：工人对生产和劳动成果缺乏控制权。国家成为一个矛盾的实体，因为平等与自由的世界与不自由和不平等的世界相矛盾。虽然劳动力和资本都是商品所有者，在法律眼中平等且自由，但事实是，商品交换中的自由和平等之下是对卖方兼商品劳动力所有者的未付劳动的剥削。国家支持这样一个不公正的系统。国家确保了产生大量不平等（资本与劳动之间，以及大企业与小规模生产者之间的不平等）的条件。鉴于国家捍卫的资本主义财产权利的剥削性质，基于“与商品生产相对应的法律关系”（马克思，1887年：64页）和基于“小规模生产者的商品生产是和正义一样永恒的生产形式”（同上）的想法来思考社会正义，在普鲁东式是徒劳的。 第六，国家在资本主义再生产中扮演着巨大的角色，然而在资本主义中的国家并不是人们经济和其他问题的主要原因，也不是阶级关系本身的原因。马克思（1847年）说： 如果资产阶级以国家权力的形式，“在财产关系中维持不公正”，那么它并没有创造这种不公正。由现代劳动分工、现代交换形式、竞争、集中等决定的“财产关系中的不公正”，绝不是由资产阶级的政治统治产生的，而恰恰相反，资产阶级的政治统治是由这些现代生产关系产生的，这些生产关系被资产阶级经济学家宣称为必要和永恒的法则。 恩格斯提出了两种观点（马克思主义和无政府主义）。从理论上讲，无政府主义的观点（例如巴枯宁）是“正是国家创造了资本，资本家只是因为国家的恩惠才拥有他的资本”，而在马克思主义的观点中，“国家权力不过是统治阶级、地主和资本家为了保护自己的社会特权而配备给自己的组织”（在马克思和恩格斯，1975年：257页）。正如我们所看到的，在马克思主义的观点中，资本主义的存在并不是因为资本主义国家，而是资本主义国家的存在是因为资本主义，然后利用它。 这些相反的理论观点通常会转化为不同的政治分歧。即使马克思主义和无政府主义都希望看到一个没有阶级和国家的社会，情况也是如此。恩格斯继续说，对于无政府主义来说，“国家是最大的恶，首先必须取消的是国家，然后资本主义就会自生自灭”（在马克思和恩格斯，1975年：257页）。但是马克思主义者有不同的看法。当恩格斯代表马克思主义者时，他说："},{"prompt":"请将“We, on the contrary say: do away with capital, the appropriation of the whole means of production in the hands of the few, and the state will fall away of itself. The difference is an essential one. Without a previous social revolution the abolition of the state is nonsense; the abolition of capital is in itself the social revolution and involves a change in the whole method of production. Finally, to some extent the capitalist state intervention can have a progressive character. Marx begins Capital 1 with associated producers and ends it with a call to expropriate the expropriators. If Marx thought that the state can improve matters significantly, he would not do this. What the capitalist class does to the most vulnerable among workers — male and female children — sums up the nature of capitalism and of the conditions of the working class as a whole. If the state has failed to protect the children from the juggernaut of capitalism, it cannot be expected to do much for the working class as a whole. Yet Marx points to the potentially progressive implications of state legislations, including those concerning education, health, etc. State regulation of the workplace, while it is an attack on capitalists’ limitless power over workers, can also be an attack on power relations within the family, an attack that is generally favourable towards children and women. When state legislation seeks to regulate commodity-production at home where children are employed in large numbers producing goods for larger businesses, state legislation is seen as an attack on parental authority.37 But the matter must be understood correctly: It was not . . . the misuse of parental authority that created the capitalistic exploitation, whether direct or indirect, of children’s labour; but, on the contrary, it was the capitalistic mode of exploitation which, by sweeping away the economic basis of parental authority, made its exercise degenerate into a mischievous misuse of power. (Marx, 1887: 320) And this points to what is possible in the future. However terrible and disgusting the dissolution, under the capitalist system, of the old family ties may appear, nevertheless, modern industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes. (ibid.) If the state measures force capitalists to adopt normal working days, capitalists have to make money in other ways (investing in constant capital). This has implications for smaller-scale capitalists and thus capitalism as such. Making use of workers working long hours and exploitation of children cannot be the major basis for remaining competitive. Small enterprises are out-competed and are swallowed by bigger capitalist units. Centralization of capital happens. The general extension of state measures to all enterprises ‘for the purpose of protecting the working-class both in mind and body . . . hastens on the general conversion of numerous isolated small industries into a few combined industries carried on upon a large scale’ thus accelerating ‘the concentration of capital and the exclusive predominance of the factory system’ (Marx, 1887: 329). And large-scale production is a pre-condition for socialism where people work together using means of production on a large scale, which can only be used in common and which allow massive increase in productivity and therefore availability of leisure time. Appendix Studying the state-crisis relation In studying the relation between the state and economic crisis, one may keep in mind the following points presented schematically. There are definite causes of — tendencies towards — the economic crisis. There are also definite counter-tendencies. However, over a long period of time and over a large enough area of commodity circulation within the world economy (e.g. a bloc of countries from the North and the South), the tendencies overpower the counter-tendencies. This means that c / v will rise faster than the rate of exploitation. The state contributes to the crisis tendency when its activities directly or indirectly increase labour-productivity-enhancing technical change that can cause c / v to rise. The counter-tendencies to the crisis are not automatic or spontaneous: at least some of these counter-tendencies could be actively mobilized by the state. This happens when the state contributes to increased capitalist exploitation of labour at the societal scale. The ability of the state to mobilize counter-tendencies to the economic crisis is limited in part because of the crisis (which contributes to the state’s fiscal crisis, for example) and will geographically vary across state-spaces (nations) as well as across regional/ sub-national economies. One also needs to study the impact of the crisis on different classes and class fractions located in different sectors and regions, and of their subjective and objective response to the state’s assistance, and so on. One needs to know whether the state responds to the causes of the crisis or to its effects. A study of the crisis requires a prior empirical analysis of the economic crisis (including of the relevant value ratios) in a number of countries, some from the North and some from the South. Besides, given that economic crisis is global and given that a state exists in a system of states, how a state can respond to economic crisis under its jurisdiction depends on its location within a system of states. However, it must be understood that the state does not have the ability to remove the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF), but the constant recurrence of crisis does potentially create conditions for the working-class mobilization against capitalism and the state. 8 The state and the agency of capitalists and state actors If a capitalist, or indeed even a very rich person, hurts a worker or a peasant, that it is almost impossible to get justice from the state is well known. This is especially the case in the periphery. A phone call or a courtesy visit by the perpetrator to a top politician and/or a bureaucrat would be enough to crush all illusion in the minds of the victim about their rights. During a strike, capitalists can wait out the workers (how long can workers survive without working?); similarly, for anything that capitalists and their hangers-on do, a court case can be dragged for years which involve a lot of money that common people cannot afford to spend, whether in rich or poor countries. When it comes to justice, state institutions work well when two equally big capitalists (or two large landowners) fight out, but for any vertical fight (the fight between capitalists or very rich people, and common people), the state is almost useless. The state must protect capitalist private property, support commodity relations and the exploitation of labour, and create general and specific conditions for accumulation. But the ways in which the state performs these actions in support of the capitalist class are not automatic. They are shaped by the agency of the capitalist class, especially its ties with state actors (decision-making politicians and officials). They are also shaped by the agency of state actors. A terminological clarification is in order. In the narrow sense, instrumentalist mechanisms that explain the nature of the state in capitalist society include individual and institutional connections between capitalists and politicians/officers. But in a wider sense, the state is an instrument — a weapon — of the capitalist class or of capitalism in that it must serve the long-term interests of the capitalist class. The instrumental connection in the narrow sense is more relevant with respect to the inner limit to state action (i.e. which indicates the imperative of the state promoting capitalist accumulation) than with respect to the outer limit (which indicates the imperative that the state must protect capitalist property rights and class relations). I begin with some remarks on structure-agency relations in Section 1. In Sections 2—3, I discuss the capitalist agency and state actors agency respectively (working-class agency is the topic of Chapter 9). Section 4 discusses the limits to what state actors can do for capitalists. In the final section, I discuss the conceptual implications of the agentic aspects of the capitalist class and state actors. 1 Structure and agency Agency (i.e. practices informed by certain ideas) presupposes a structure. A structure is a set of certain internal relations among various processes and objects, the relations that in turn set up certain mechanisms (ways of doing/ acting). An individual or a group acts as an agent when they make a difference in the face of the constraints that a structure imposes, including by utilizing opportunities provided by the structure of relations under which one acts. If under given structural conditions (S), one expects outcome (O1) but if another outcome (O2) is observed that is significantly different from O1, then, other things constant, one may say that agency — certain agentic behaviour — has made a difference. Structural conditions are inert. They can only propel action, but they cannot act. If history is understood in terms of changes in the structural conditions, it is easy to see that history itself does not act. (Similarly, the geographical organiza-tion of people’s activities itself does little.) People — as classes/class fractions — operating in time-space — do the acting on the stage created by the structural conditions. ‘History’ or time, and one might add geography (location, etc.), ‘does nothing’, and it does not fight. Much rather, ‘[i]t is man, real, living man who . . . fights’. Further, ‘ “history” is not . . . a person apart, using man as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of man pursuing his aims’ (Marx and Engels, 1845; italics added). The materialist- dialectical standpoint of Marxism does not reify structures, so it does not ignore the role of human agency either, while it insists on the primary role of structural necessity in historical changes. Men and women do make their own history but, ‘in the first place, under very definite antecedents [assumptions] and conditions’ (Engels in Marx and Engels, 1975: 395). Making history (and geography) means exercising agency and will. Depending on its nature, agency can reproduce or transcend a structure.”翻译为中文","completion":"相反，我们说：消除资本，即消除少数人手中对全部生产资料的占有，国家自然会随之消亡。这一差异是本质上的。没有一场先行的社会革命，废除国家就是无稽之谈；废除资本本身就是社会革命，并涉及到整个生产方式的变革。 最后，在一定程度上，资本主义国家的干预可以具有进步的性质。马克思在《资本论》第一卷开篇讨论了联合起来的生产者，并以呼吁没收剥削者的财产作为结束。如果马克思认为国家能显著改善局势，他就不会这么做。资本家阶级对工人中最脆弱者——男孩和女孩——的所作所为，概括了资本主义的本质和整个工人阶级的状况。如果国家未能保护儿童免受资本主义的摧残，那么就不应期望它能为整个工人阶级做更多的事。 然而，马克思指出国家立法包括有关教育、健康等方面的潜在进步意义。国家对工作场所的规制，虽然是对资本家对工人无限权力的一种攻击，但也可以是对家庭内部权力关系的攻击，这种攻击通常对儿童和女性是有利的。当国家立法寻求规制家庭内的商品生产——在这些家庭中，大批儿童被雇用生产商品供大企业使用时，国家立法被视为对父权的攻击。但必须正确理解这一点： 并不是......父权的滥用创造了对儿童劳动的资本主义性剥削，无论是直接的还是间接的；恰恰相反，正是资本主义的剥削方式，通过消除父权的经济基础，使其行使变质为有害的权力滥用。 （马克思，1887年：320页） 这指向了未来的可能性。 无论在资本主义制度下，旧家庭关系的解散看起来多么可怕和令人厌恶，然而，现代工业通过将女性、青年和不同性别的儿童分配到家庭领域以外的生产过程中的重要部分，为家庭和两性关系的更高形式创造了新的经济基础。 （同上） 如果国家措施迫使资本家采用正常的工作日，资本家必须通过其他方式赚钱（投资于固定资本）。这对小型资本家乃至整个资本主义都有影响。利用工人长时间工作和剥削儿童不能成为保持竞争力的主要基础。小型企业被淘汰，并被更大的资本单位吞并。资本集中发生了。国家对所有企业采取措施“为了保护工人阶级的身心健康……加速了众多孤立的小型产业向少数几个大规模联合产业的转变”，从而促进了“资本的集中和工厂制度的专有优势”（马克思，1887年：329页）。大规模生产是社会主义的先决条件，在社会主义中，人们共同使用大规模的生产手段，这些手段只能共同使用，并且允许大幅度提高生产力，因此有更多的闲暇时间。 附录 研究国家-危机关系 在研究国家与经济危机之间的关系时，可以牢记以下几点，以示意性的方式呈现。 经济危机的成因 —— 趋势 —— 是明确的。也有明确的反趋势。然而，长时间来看，在世界经济内足够大的商品流通范围内（例如，来自北方和南方的一组国家），趋势会压倒反趋势。这意味着 c / v（资本与可变资本之比）上升的速度会快于剥削率的上升。当国家的活动直接或间接增加了提高劳动生产率的技术变革，可能导致c / v上升时，国家就会促成危机趋势。 危机的反趋势不是自动发生或自发的：至少其中一些反趋势可能是国家积极动员的。当国家有助于提高资本家对劳动的剥削时，就会发生这种情况。 国家动员经济危机反趋势的能力在一定程度上受到危机的限制（例如，导致国家财政危机），并且将在不同国家/地区以及跨地区/次国家经济中地理上有所不同。 还需要研究不同阶层和位于不同部门和地区的阶层分支的危机影响，以及他们对国家援助的主观和客观反应等。需要知道国家是对危机的原因进行回应，还是对其影响进行回应。 研究危机需要先对一些国家的经济危机（包括相关的价值比率）进行先验的实证分析，这些国家有的来自北方，有的来自南方。此外，鉴于经济危机是全球性的，且鉴于国家存在于一个国家系统中，国家如何应对其管辖范围内的经济危机取决于其在国家系统中的位置。然而，必须理解，国家没有能力消除利润率下降的趋势（TRPF），但危机的不断重现确实为工人阶级动员反对资本主义和国家创造了条件。 8 国家与资本家及国家行为者的代理 资本家，甚至非常富有的人，伤害了工人或农民，几乎不可能从国家那里获得正义，这是众所周知的。在边缘地带尤其如此。肇事者给顶级政客和/或官僚打个电话或进行一次礼节性拜访就足以粉碎受害者对其权利的所有幻想。在罢工期间，资本家可以等待工人（工人能在不工作的情况下生存多久？）；同样，对于资本家及其追随者所做的任何事情，法庭案件可以拖延多年，这涉及到很多钱，普通人无论在富裕还是贫穷的国家都负担不起。 当谈到正义时，只有当两个同样大的资本家（或两个大地主）相互争斗时，国家机构才能发挥良好作用，但对于任何垂直斗争（资本家或非常富有的人与普通人之间的斗争），国家几乎无能为力。 国家必须保护资本家的私有财产，支持商品关系和劳动的剥削，并为积累创造一般和特定的条件。但国家支持资本家阶级的行动方式并不是自动的。它们受到资本家阶级的代理特别是其与国家行为者（决策政治家和官员）之间的联系的影响。它们还受到国家行为者的代理的影响。 需要一点术语澄清。在狭义上，解释资本主义社会下国家性质的工具主义机制包括资本家与政治家/官员之间的个人和机构联系。但在广义上，国家是资本家阶级或资本主义的工具——一种武器——因为它必须为资本家阶级的长期利益服务。狭义上的工具连接更多地与国家行动的内在限制相关（即表明国家促进资本积累的必要性），而非与外在限制相关（表明国家必须保护资本家财产权和阶级关系的必要性）。 我将从第1部分关于结构-代理关系的一些评论开始。在第2-3部分，我分别讨论资本家代理和国家行为者代理（第9章将讨论工人阶级的代理）。第4部分讨论国家行为者能为资本家做什么的限制。在最后一部分，我讨论了资本家阶级和国家行为者的代理性方面的概念意义。 1 结构和代理 代理（即由某些想法告知的做法）假定有一个结构。结构是各种过程和对象之间的某些内部关系的集合，反过来这些关系建立了某些机制（做/行事的方式）。当个人或一群人在结构施加的限制下，包括利用一个人行动下的关系结构提供的机会，作出差异时，他们就充当了代理。如果在给定的结构条件（S）下，预期结果（O1），但观察到的另一个结果（O2）与O1有显著不同，那么，在其他条件不变的情况下，可以说是代理——某种代理行为——发挥了作用。结构条件是惰性的。它们只能推动行动，但它们自己不能行动。 如果历史被理解为结构条件的变化，很容易看到历史本身并不行动。（同样，人们活动的地理组织本身也做得很少。）人们——作为阶级/阶层分子——在时间-空间中操作——在结构条件创建的舞台上行动。'历史'或时间，可以加上地理（位置等），'什么也不做'，它不战斗。更确切地说，'是人，是真实的、活着的人……进行战斗'。此外，'“历史”并不是......一个独立的人，使用人作为实现自己目标的手段；历史只不过是人追求自己目标的活动'（马克思和恩格斯，1845年；加了斜体）。 马克思主义的唯物辩证立场不是对结构进行物化，因此它也不忽视人的代理的作用，同时它坚持在历史变革中结构必要性的主要作用。男人和女人确实是在制造自己的历史，但是，“首先，是在非常确定的先决条件[假设]和条件下”（恩格斯在马克思和恩格斯，1975年：395页）。制造历史（和地理）意味着行使代理和意志。根据其性质，代理可以复制或超越一个结构。"},{"prompt":"请将“Agency involves knowledge or consciousness which shapes the material practice of the agent under structural conditions, even if ultimately structural conditions set a limit to the nature of consciousness. To act, one needs to know what to act on and how, and that means that cognitive error is a possibility: one may not know fully. In part because of this possibility, even if a given agentic behaviour aims to materialize certain structural imperative, it may not succeed, or it may succeed unevenly in time-space: it may succeed here more than there, and now and not then. There can be conflicts between the agentic powers of different individuals and groups. Engels writes: ‘[T]here are innumerable intersecting forces, an infinite series of parallelograms of forces which give rise to one resultant — the historical event’ (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 395—6). One can think about the agency of different capitalists and of state actors as ‘innumerable intersecting forces’ with wills between and among which there can be contradiction. Given the capitalist structure, the state must perform certain functions (this is the level of relatively more abstract analysis), but the ways in which such functions are performed through the relevant agency belong to a relatively more concrete level of analysis. The present chapter deals with the agency of capitalists (individual capitalists or a group of capitalists) and of high-level state actors. 2 Capitalists’ agency State policies are indeed affected by the inter-penetration of personnel, including instrumentalist control.1 Bukharin (1988: 242), a classical Marxist, says that in capitalism ‘the bourgeoisie is in control of production and therefore also of the state’. He also says that ‘the structure of the State itself reflects the economic structure, i.e. the same classes occupy relatively the same positions’, meaning that higher positions in the state are filled by people from the bourgeoisie (ibid.). Capitalists cultivate special relations with politicians and top bureaucrats who then shower favours on them: so there is a degree of overlap between the class of capitalists and higher-level state personnel (Figure 8.1). A major goal of the capitalist institutions is to advocate for a given policy that is dominantly, if not exclusively, pro-market and pro-business (increasingly pro-big-business) relative to the interests of the common people. The capitalist class is indeed connected to the state machine ‘by thousands of threads’ (Lenin’s words). It uses the state in their own parochial interest and, generally, against the interests of the masses: Two institutions most characteristic of this state machine are the bureaucracy and the standing army. In their works, Marx and Engels repeatedly show that the bourgeoisie are connected with these institutions by thousands of threads. Every worker’s experience illustrates this connection in an extremely graphic and impressive manner. From its own bitter experience, the working class learns to recognize this connection. (Lenin, 1949: 31; italics added) Why does instrumentalist connection exist? This should be answered from the standpoint of capital as a whole and from the standpoint of competing capitalists. There is a structural pressure on one arm of the capitalist social totality (i.e. the state) to serve another arm (i.e. the capitalist class). The pressure needs to be activated and manifested by capitalist agency. While an educated and healthy workforce and a good physical environment are in the interest of the whole capitalist class, ensuring that this actually happens — and note anti-capitalist forces can counter/weaken the state imperative to act in the capitalists interests as can ideas and actions of state actors themselves — may require some capitalists or their associations to cultivate ties with the relevant state personnel. The manifestation of the structural pressure can have a flexible temporality and flexible spatiality: while the state, more or less, needs to serve the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie over a given period of time and at the national scale, the agency of the capitalist class as a whole, or of specific hegemonic fractions is necessary in order to ensure the correct timing of a pro-capitalist policy.2 It is also necessary for the correct spacing of a procapitalist policy (explained later). The state is to look after not only long-term interests but long-term common interests of the bourgeoisie. Common interests coexist with fractional interests. This fact prompts capitalists’ agency. So the matter of capital versus capitals is important. Capital as a whole, the reality of common interests, exists and functions through mutually competing capitals with different needs and interests.3 Capitalists’ interests are different because they differ in terms of their size of investment (smaller and bigger capitalists) and sector (different capitalists produce different use-values). Capitalists are different in terms of specific accumulation strategies: some rely on technical change as a way of increasing profit to a larger extent than others; some are more integrated into the world economy and are export-oriented than others. Capitalists also differ in terms of location: some fractions (especially productive capital as opposed to money capital) are based in specific areas. Their profits come from specific places, so they are more geographically dependent. Utilities companies are fairly place-based, as are farm-based and mining enterprises. Given place dependence of some capitals at multiple scales (local, sub-national, national, and so on), what state institutions do in a given place matters a lot, which means that ties to the state institutions are important, the ties that are not spatially portable (Cox, 2002). This is why spacing of policy is important: capitalists interests are regionally/locally specific (e.g. mining industry here, utilities industry there), so the state must meet geographically circumscribed capitalist interests and not just capitalist interests. The question is, given that different capitalists have different interests and that they compete with one another, what are the ways in which inter-capitalist relation relates to capitalist agency? There are several. 1 While over the long term the state serves the common affairs of the capitalist class, an existing state policy may benefit certain capitalists and adversely affect their competing siblings. When a given policy is in place, capitalists seek to maximize its favourable impact and/or minimize its unfavourable impact, through their special ties with state actors. If the state has decided to introduce a policy to privatize state-owned companies and is looking for buyers, then it can favour some private capitalists — including those who might have offered financial help to the governing party, clandestinely or not — over others. Alternatively, a given regulation is countered through close ties, legal and illegal. This applies to not only domestic capital but also to foreign capital: ‘the executive committees of the main institutions of globalization’ and imperialism such as ‘the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) are composed of the finance ministers of the leading capitalist powers’ and the finance ministers in turn have ‘close ties with the chief transnational corporations’ (Aronowitz and Bratsis, 2002: xxi). 2 At a given point in time, different — and often mutually contradictory — strategies of capitalist accumulation are possible, because of contradictions among capitalists and because the state itself may not exactly know what to do, so capitalists advocate for, through personal and institutional ties, certain state strategies in their favour. Strong ties between capitalists and the state personnel can also help capitalists to avoid existing unfavourable regulations and stop future regulations of profit-making and thus remain competitive. A capitalist or a group of capitalists can ‘buy’ an entire policy package (e.g. a policy that opens insurance industry to private investors or that allows contract farming whereby agribusiness has greater control over farm input/output markets). Harman (1991) writes: ‘capitalists have always tried to boost their competitive positions by establishing alliances’ with influential politicians, and such alliances are ‘cemented by money but also by intermarriage, old boy networks, mutual socialising’. 3 The political turnover time is quickened: an application for certain required permissions is dealt with more quickly (e.g. permission to open a new firm or sell a newly created vaccine or drug and/or that allows the use of genetically modified seeds which have hitherto been opposed by large segments of the population). This is often done by ignoring existing rules; for example, a permission to open a factory is given without a proper environmental clearance or socio-economic impact assessment, thanks in particular to personal/institutional ties. 4 Personal ties are important not just in the context of competitive relations among capitalists. They can be important when the government introduces a measure or is planning to do so, under pressure of the masses. To the extent that inter-capitalist competition sets the context for instrumental connection between capitalists and the state, the competition in question is the competition among capitalists over the surplus value to be appropriated from the masses. During periods of intense class struggle, certain capitalist fractions may be much less conciliatory — or more aggressive — towards the masses than other fractions. So they may try to influence state action through their ties to politicians and bureaucrats in the civil administration and the army. There is also a possibility of class struggle within the state, with some influential state actors representing the voice and interests of the masses. A large part of the totality of state apparatuses is indeed populated by common people (men and women from working class and small-scale producers background (Figure 8.1) who do not necessarily share a common ground with the top layers). This creates a need to use the instrumental connection with other state actors, especially the more powerful ones, to counter the ‘reformist’ elements unless they are countered spontaneously within the state. The short-term interests of capitalists (e.g. capitalists paying very low wages and industries which pollute a lot) can be adversely affected if, for example, the state takes measures against the payment of low wages or excessive pollution, in part because of common people’s struggles. Often big businesses support regulations concerning health and safety, especially if small businesses cannot afford them (Harvey, 2010a: 228). So they capture the state regulatory apparatuses to eliminate competition. It is widely known that the British colonial state introduced pro-worker measures at least partly in order to increase the cost of production in the enterprises owned by indigenous Indian capitalists competing with British capitalists. Because state regulation necessitates greater outlay of capital, smaller capitalists can be outcompeted by bigger capitalists.”翻译为中文","completion":"代理涉及知识或意识，这些知识或意识在结构条件下塑造代理人的物质实践，即使最终结构条件对意识的性质设定了限制。要采取行动，一个人需要知道对什么采取行动以及如何采取行动，这意味着认知错误是一种可能性：一个人可能不会完全了解。部分原因是这种可能性，即使某种代理行为旨在实现某种结构性要求，它也可能不会成功，或者它的成功在时间和空间上可能是不均匀的：它可能在这里比在那里更成功，现在而不是那时。不同个体和群体之间的代理权力可能存在冲突。恩格斯写道：“有无数相互交叉的力量，无限系列的力量平行四边形，产生一个结果 — 历史事件”（马克思和恩格斯，1975年：395-6）。可以将不同资本家和国家行为者的代理看作是“无数相互交叉的力量”，其间及其中可能存在矛盾。 鉴于资本主义结构，国家必须执行某些功能（这是较为抽象分析的层面），但这些功能通过相关代理的执行方式属于较具体的分析层面。本章讨论的是资本家（个别资本家或资本家群体）和高层国家行为者的代理。 2 资本家的代理 国家政策确实受到人员交互渗透的影响，包括工具主义控制。古典马克思主义者布哈林（1988年：242）说，在资本主义中“资产阶级控制着生产，因此也控制着国家”。他还说，“国家的结构本身反映了经济结构，即相同的阶级在相对相同的位置上占据着”，意味着国家的高层位置由资产阶级人士担任（同上）。资本家与政治家和高级官僚培养特殊关系，然后为他们提供恩惠：因此，资本家阶级与高级国家人员之间存在一定程度的重叠（图8.1）。资本家机构的一个主要目标是提倡某种特定政策，这种政策主要（如果不是专门地）是亲市场和亲商业的（越来越偏向大企业），相对于普通人的利益而言。 资本家阶级确实通过“成千上万的线索”（列宁的话）与国家机器相连。它们出于自己的狭隘利益使用国家，并且通常与大众利益相悖： 这种国家机器最具特征的两个机构是官僚体系和常备军。马克思和恩格斯在他们的作品中反复显示，资产阶级和这些机构通过成千上万的线索相连。每一个工人的经历都以极其生动和引人注目的方式说明了这种联系。工人阶级通过自己的痛苦经历学会了认识这种联系。 （列宁，1949年：31页；斜体加原文） 为什么存在工具主义联系？这应该从整个资本的角度以及竞争资本家的角度回答。 资本主义社会整体的一个分支（即国家）存在一种结构性压力，要为另一个分支（即资本家阶级）服务。这种压力需要通过资本家的代理来激活和表现。虽然受过教育且健康的劳动力和良好的自然环境符合整个资本家阶级的利益，但确保这实际发生 —— 注意反资本主义力量可以对抗/削弱国家为资本家利益行动的要求，国家行为者自己的想法和行动也是如此 —— 可能需要一些资本家或他们的协会与相关国家人员建立联系。结构性压力的表现可以有灵活的时间性和空间性：虽然国家或多或少需要在给定时间内和国家层面上为资产阶级的基本利益服务，但整个资本家阶级或特定的霸权派别的代理是必要的，以确保亲资本主义政策的正确时机。也需要正确的政策空间布局（稍后解释）。 国家不仅要照顾资产阶级的长期利益，还要照顾资产阶级的长期共同利益。共同利益与派别利益并存。这一事实促使资本家采取代理行动。因此，资本与众多资本之间的问题很重要。作为一个整体的资本，共同利益的现实，通过彼此竞争的不同需求和利益的资本而存在并运作。资本家的利益因其投资规模（小型和大型资本家）和部门（不同资本家生产不同的使用价值）的不同而不同。资本家在具体积累战略方面也有所不同：一些人比其他人更依赖于技术变革作为增加利润的方式；一些人比其他人更融入世界经济并以出口为导向。 资本家在地理位置上也有所不同：一些派别（特别是生产资本相对于货币资本）基于特定地区。他们的利润来自特定地点，因此他们更依赖于地理位置。公用事业公司相当基于地点，农场基础和采矿企业也是如此。鉴于某些资本在多个层面（地方、次国家、国家等）上的地点依赖性，国家机构在给定地点的所作所为非常重要，这意味着与国家机构的联系很重要，这些联系在空间上不可移动（Cox，2002）。这就是为什么政策空间布局很重要：资本家利益在地域上/在地方上是特定的（例如，这里的矿业，那里的公用事业），所以国家必须满足地域范围内限定的资本家利益，而不仅仅是资本家利益。 问题是，鉴于不同的资本家有不同的利益并且彼此竞争，资本家之间的关系如何与资本家的代理有关？有几个方面。 1 虽然从长远来看，国家服务于资本家阶级的共同事务，但现有的国家政策可能使某些资本家受益，而对他们的竞争同胞产生不利影响。当一个特定政策到位时，资本家寻求最大化其有利影响和/或最小化其不利影响，通过与国家行为者的特殊联系。如果国家决定引入一项将国有公司私有化的政策，并正在寻找买家，那么它可以偏袒一些私人资本家——包括那些可能秘密或公开向执政党提供财政帮助的人——而不是其他人。或者，通过密切联系对抗特定的规则，无论是合法还是非法。这不仅适用于国内资本，也适用于外国资本：“全球化的主要机构的执行委员会”和帝国主义，如“国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行（WB）由领先资本主义大国的财政部长组成”，而财政部长反过来与“主要跨国公司有着密切的联系”（Aronowitz和Bratsis，2002年：xxi）。 2 在给定的时间点，由于资本家之间的矛盾以及国家本身可能不确切知道该做什么，因此可能存在不同的——通常是相互矛盾的——资本积累策略，所以资本家通过个人和机构联系，为自己倡导某种国家战略。资本家与国家人员之间的紧密关系也可以帮助资本家避免现有的不利规定，阻止对盈利的未来规定，从而保持竞争力。一个资本家或一群资本家可以“购买”整个政策包（例如，一项将保险行业对私人投资者开放的政策或允许合同农业的政策，从而使农业企业对农产品输入/输出市场有更大的控制权）。哈曼（1991）写道：“资本家一直试图通过与有影响力的政治家建立联盟来提升他们的竞争地位”，这些联盟“通过金钱以及通过通婚、老男孩网络、相互社交活动来巩固”。 3 政治周转时间加快：对某些所需许可的申请得到更快处理（例如，开设新公司的许可或销售新开发的疫苗或药物的许可，和/或允许使用迄今为大部分人群所反对的转基因种子）。这通常是通过忽视现有规则来完成的；例如，在没有适当的环境准入或社会经济影响评估的情况下，给予开设工厂的许可，特别是由于个人/机构联系。 4 个人联系不仅在资本家之间的竞争关系中很重要。当政府在大众压力下推出措施或计划推出措施时，它们也很重要。在资本家与国家之间的工具连接背景下，互相竞争的资本家关乎从大众那里占有的剩余价值竞争。在激烈的阶级斗争期间，某些资本家派别可能比其他派别对大众少让步——或者更加侵略性——因此他们可能试图通过与政治家和文职行政机关和军队中的官僚的联系来影响国家行为。国家内部也可能存在阶级斗争，一些有影响力的国家行为者代表大众的声音和利益。实际上，国家机构的很大一部分是由普通民众（来自工人阶级和小规模生产者背景的男女）组成的，他们并不一定与高层有共同立场。这就产生了利用与其他国家行为者，尤其是更有权势的人的工具联系的需求，除非他们在国家内部自发地被对抗，以对抗“改革派”分子。 如果国家采取措施反对低工资支付或过度污染，那么资本家的短期利益（例如，支付非常低工资的资本家和污染严重的行业）可能会受到不利影响，部分原因是普通民众的斗争。通常大企业支持有关健康和安全的法规，尤其是如果小企业负担不起它们（哈维，2010a：228）。因此，他们夺取了国家监管机构以消除竞争。众所周知，英国殖民国家至少部分地引入了亲工人措施，以增加与英国资本家竞争的印度本土资本家拥有的企业的生产成本。由于国家规则需要更多的资本投入，较小的资本家可能会被较大的资本家淘汰。"},{"prompt":"请将“Capitalists use their ties with state personnel not only to reap an advantage vis-à-vis their competitors but also to make sure that the threat from the masses remains minimized. If a state policy is nonetheless introduced, its actual implementation can be blunted through the same ties between capitalists and the state. For example, laws regarding fire safety can be conveniently ignored by capitalists seeking to reduce the cost of production and remain competitive. This happens on the basis of the ties between capitalists and state actors (e.g. factory inspectors and/or their immediate political bosses). When masses engage in a struggle for concessions from capitalists (e.g. a rise in wages), having a good relation with the police officers and their political bosses comes in very handy. All states use the mechanism of intimidation to weaken people’s struggle, and the proximate driving force for this mechanism, including how quickly it happens and with what intensity and so on, is often the ties between specific capitalists and state actors. By using their personal and institutional ties with the state, capitalists can buy their own safety; they can also get state actors to endanger the personal safety of militant trade union leaders and politically active rank-and-file workers, print/electronic media journalists who report abuse and injustice, and even judges, and indeed anyone, who is more vocal against capitalist beyond a given limit. The greater the intensity of inter-capitalist competition, the greater the intensity of potential or actual class struggle of the masses, and the greater the dependence of capitalists on a given place (e.g. large farm or mineral-based factory), the more intense are the instrumental ties between capitalists and state actors. Whether the ties are legal or illegal does not matter. This is because by virtue of the ties, an illegal transaction/tie can be presented as legal. Capitalists make use of their associations/institutions to exercise their agency in a society where they do have structural power by virtue of their control over the economy. The fact that business people ‘require associations’ cannot be used as an evidence to say, as liberals such as King (1986: 160) do, that they do not have structural power and that they are not ‘inevitably privileged in the political systems of advanced capitalist societies’. Panitch and Gindin (2015: 8) say that capitalists ‘come together as real social actors through institutions which play a crucial role in their formation, identity and behaviour’ and which help them overcome their mutual divisions. Apart from the institutions of bourgeois democracy (e.g. parliament, bourgeois parties, and so on, there are at least four major capitalist ‘institutions’ (including associations) that link capitalists to their instrument, the state. Organizations of the capitalist class Operating as non-profit entities, national and regional-scale trade organizations of the capitalist class actively connect capitalists’ interests to the bourgeois political parties and bureaucracies. This indicates that monopolies with their immense economic power can have direct interaction with the state personnel (Mandel, 1978: 490). In the US context, such organizations as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Committee for Economic Development, the Conference Board, the Business Council, and the Business Roundtable help the members of the capitalist community to transcend their interest-group consciousness and to develop an overall class consciousness, by identifying the long-term interests of the capitalist class as a whole (Barrow, 1993: 33).4 They ‘are usually financed through corporate contributions and draw the bulk of their membership directly from the capitalist class and act as the political inner circle of the capitalist class’. In India, such organizations include All India Organization of Employers and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Think tanks, opinion makers, and lobbyists They survey the diverse business interests to acquire specific knowledge about what the different capitalists need in a concrete situation and suggest favourable compromise policies in support of the capitalist class or its hegemonic fractions.5 University professors, retired civil servants, judges, and many others can lend their distinguished service, anonymously or not, and for a payment in cash or kind (e.g. appointment to a governmental commission/ position and the like). These policy proposals are sugar-coated by an appeal to national development, people’s welfare, and so on in order to create a belief that what is good for business is good for people, and that is, that capitalists’ investment decisions even if they hurt people, and the state’s economic policies, even if they benefit the businesses, are ultimately in the interest of the common people. In other words, the general economic interests of the tiny capitalist class are expressed as concrete state policies which are claimed to benefit everyone. So blatantly capitalist policies are de-classed. These think tanks, which provide crucial ideas to bureaucrats for drafting pro-business policy statements, often function as firms in the non-governmental sector, which some see as a progressive counter current to capitalists and to the state. The task of the production of such blatantly false perception of capitalist policies as pro-people on the part of think tanks and bureaucrats is complemented by a pliant pro-business media which often depends on governments’ advertisements and which presents the sugar-coated policies and ideas as acceptable to the common people.6 Armed with the relevant knowledge produced by think tanks and the like, lobbyists do their work on behalf of individual capitalists or groups of them. Most recently in the US, business lobbyists are targeting a proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy to help cover costs for funding boosts in areas related to climate change, education, and so on. Justifiably annoyed at this, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders has said: This is what oligarchy and a corrupt political system are all about. The rich and large corporations get richer, and their lobbyists do everything possible to protect their wealth and greed. (quoted in Folley, 2021) Lobbying is one of the ‘political processes’ that ‘are necessary “transmission belts” between capital and the state’ (Barrow, 1993: 62). ‘Experts in lobbying firms . . . do the work of conceiving and writing the documents that give direction and coherence to policy formulations’ (Peet, 2007: 85). Peet even suggests that the notion of ‘the state, “the government” or even “political institutions” has to be expanded to include these private bureaucracies’ (ibid.). People’s organizations No capitalists, especially larger capitalists, can afford to completely ignore the dissenting voices in society. Cultivating a good relation with trade union bureaucrats, liberal or critical-minded academics, moderate parts of Left parties and progressive grassroots ecological and other movements can contribute to the production of an image of a conscientious capitalist, a capitalist with a sense of corporate social responsibility.7 (Some bourgeois politicians also maintain good relations with the ‘progressive movements’ in order to cultivate a good image and to give their actions a progressive cover.) Instrumental ties are not merely ‘sociological’: capitalists do not just cultivate personal relations with state actors. They are deeply material as they involve in-cash transactions (e.g. open and secretive election funding, apart from bribing) and/or in-kind transactions (e.g. offer of private sector jobs to ‘good’ civil servants and politicians, providing helicopters for election campaign, vouching for civil servants for appointment to good posts within the government, public support for politicians during elections including by allowing their own media outlets to be used by them). At a concrete level, the state is like a big real estate owned by top politicians and officers, which can be ‘bought’ in small parcels by capitalists, and yet the more that real estate is bought, the more it remains. It is not a massive exaggeration to say that different parts of the state (or different state actors) are in the pocket of different moneybags at different points in time. While in the LDCs, both politicians and officials are involved in the clandestine deals with the business world, in the advanced countries, civil servants may be less so while elected politicians are deeply connected to businesses through the money connection.8 As we know, capitalists engage in M-C-M': they invest money, buy commodities, and sell the same commodities or manufactured commodities for more money than invested. In terms of their political connection with state personnel, a political version of the capital circuit might be seen as functioning. Capitalists invest money (M^) to influence state actors and buy favourable interventions/policies. The latter is capitalists’ political commodity, Cp. Cp helps capitalists remain competitive and reduces the cost of doing business, including what they might otherwise have to spend on workers’ safety and the like. So capitalists with connections to the state can make more money than they invest in their instrumentalist ties (M'p). Thus, in the sphere of politics, or statecapital relation, capitalists engage in what can be called a political capital circuit: Mp _ Cp _ M'p (where the subscript ‘p’ stands for political). 3 State actors’ agency Capitalists use ties to state actors. But these ties are the ties with the state actors who have a degree of autonomy relative to a given capitalist or a group of capitalists. A major reason for state autonomy is what much of state theory has pointed out (as discussed in Chapter 2): the fact that individual capitalists generally do not need to exercise coercion against other capitalists or their workers in economic transactions contributes to the state enjoying a degree of autonomy vis-à-vis individual capitalists. Besides, as Creaven (2000: 267) says, ‘the relative autonomy of polity from the direct control of the ruling class acquires a consistently high form, and its most stable form, in a developed capitalist society’ because ‘the productive forces are sufficiently advanced here to support an independent “unproductive” centralised administrative apparatus on a nationwide scale’.”翻译为中文","completion":"资本家不仅利用与国家人员的联系来获得相对于竞争对手的优势，而且还确保来自大众的威胁保持最小化。如果某项国家政策得以推出，其实际实施可能通过资本家与国家之间同样的联系被削弱。例如，资本家为了降低生产成本并保持竞争力，可以方便地忽视有关消防安全的法律。这是基于资本家与国家行为者（例如工厂检查员和/或他们的直接政治上司）之间的联系发生的。 当大众为了从资本家那里争取让步（例如提高工资）而进行斗争时，与警察官员及其政治上司保持良好关系非常有用。所有国家都使用恐吓机制来削弱人民的斗争，而这种机制的直接驱动力，包括其发生的速度、强度等，往往是特定资本家与国家行为者之间的联系。通过与国家的个人和机构联系，资本家可以为自己购买安全；他们还可以让国家行为者危及激进工会领导人和政治上活跃的普通工人、报道虐待和不公的印刷/电子媒体记者，甚至是法官，以及任何对资本家超出一定限度更加直言不讳的人的人身安全。 资本家间竞争的强度越大，大众潜在或实际阶级斗争的强度越大，资本家对特定地点的依赖程度越大（例如大型农场或矿产加工厂），资本家与国家行为者之间的工具联系就越紧密。这些联系是合法还是非法并不重要。这是因为凭借这些联系，非法交易/联系可以被表现为合法。 资本家利用他们的协会/机构在他们通过控制经济获得结构权力的社会中行使他们的代理。说商人“需要协会”的事实不能被用作证据，正如自由主义者如金（King，1986年：160页）所说，他们没有结构权力，他们在先进资本主义社会的政治系统中“不可避免地享有特权”。潘尼奇和金丁（Panitch and Gindin，2015年：8页）说，资本家“通过发挥至关重要作用的机构以真实的社会行动者身份走到一起，这些机构在他们的形成、认同和行为方面发挥着关键作用”，并帮助他们克服彼此的分歧。 除了资产阶级民主制度的机构（例如议会、资产阶级政党等），至少有四个主要的资本家“机构”（包括协会）将资本家与他们的工具——国家联系起来。 资本家阶级的组织 作为非盈利实体运作的国家和地区规模的资本家阶级贸易组织积极将资本家的利益与资产阶级政党和官僚体系联系起来。这表明，垄断巨头凭借其巨大的经济力量可以与国家人员进行直接互动（曼德尔，1978年：490页）。 在美国背景下，诸如对外关系委员会、经济发展委员会、会议委员会、商业理事会和商业圆桌会议等组织帮助资本家社区的成员超越他们的利益集团意识，发展整体的阶级意识，通过确定资本家阶级整体的长期利益（巴罗，1993年：33页）。他们“通常通过企业捐款资助，并且大部分成员直接来自资本家阶级，并充当资本家阶级的政治核心圈”。在印度，这样的组织包括全印度雇主组织和印度商会联合会。 智库、观点制造者和说客 他们调查多样化的商业利益，获取有关不同资本家在具体情况下需要什么的具体知识，并建议支持资本家阶级或其霸权派别的有利妥协政策。大学教授、退休公务员、法官和许多其他人可以无名或有偿（例如任命为政府委员会/职位等）提供他们的杰出服务。这些政策提案通过呼吁国家发展、人民福祉等来包装，以此创造一种信念，即对企业有利的就对人民有利，即资本家的投资决策即使伤害了人民，国家的经济政策即使有利于企业，最终也符合普通人的利益。换句话说，微小的资本家阶级的一般经济利益被表达为据称惠及每个人的具体国家政策。因此，赤裸裸的资本主义政策被去阶级化。这些智库为官僚提供起草亲商业政策声明的关键想法，通常作为非政府部门的公司运作，一些人将其视为对抗资本家和国家的进步逆流。智库和官僚制造的这种赤裸裸的将资本主义政策视为亲民政策的错误观念，得到了依赖政府广告并将包装好的政策和观点呈现给普通民众的亲商业媒体的补充。 有了智库等产生的相关知识，说客代表个别资本家或他们的集团开展工作。最近在美国，商业说客正瞄准一项提议，即提高富人税收以帮助支付气候变化、教育等领域的成本。参议院预算委员会主席伯尼·桑德斯恰当地表示： 这就是寡头统治和腐败政治制度的全部内容。富人和大公司变得更富有，他们的说客想方设法保护他们的财富和贪婪。 （引自 Folley, 2021） 游说是“资本与国家之间必要的‘传动带’之一”（巴罗，1993年：62）。 “游说公司的专家……负责构思和撰写为政策制定提供方向和连贯性的文件”（皮特，2007年：85）。皮特甚至建议，“国家”、“政府”甚至“政治机构”的概念必须扩展到包括这些私人官僚机构”。 人民组织 没有资本家，尤其是大资本家，可以完全忽视社会中的异议声音。与工会官僚、自由派或批判性学者、温和的左翼政党部分以及进步的基层生态和其他运动建立良好关系，可以有助于树立有社会责任感的资本家形象。 （一些资产阶级政治家也与“进步运动”保持良好关系，以塑造良好形象，并为其行动提供进步的掩护。） 工具联系不仅仅是“社会学”的：资本家不只是与国家行为者建立个人关系。它们在物质上是深刻的，因为它们涉及现金交易（例如公开和秘密的选举资金，除了贿赂）和/或实物交易（例如为“好”的公务员和政治家提供私营部门工作，提供直升机用于竞选活动，为公务员担保任命为政府内部的好职位，公开支持选举期间的政治家，包括允许自己的媒体被他们使用）。 在具体层面上，国家就像是由顶层政客和官员“拥有”的一块大地产，资本家可以通过小块购买，但越买地产越多，它仍然存在。说不同的国家部分（或不同的国家行为者）在不同时间点被不同的金钱袋控制，并不是太夸张。虽然在低收入国家，政客和官员都参与与商界的秘密交易，在发达国家，公务员可能较少参与，而当选的政治家通过金钱联系与商业深度联系。 我们知道，资本家从事 M-C-M' 活动：他们投资金钱，购买商品，并以投资的钱更多的钱卖掉同样的商品或制造的商品。就他们与国家人员的政治联系而言，可以看到资本循环的政治版本正在起作用。资本家投资金钱（M^）以影响国家行为者并购买有利的干预/政策。后者是资本家的政治商品，Cp。Cp 帮助资本家保持竞争力，降低做生意的成本，包括他们可能必须在工人安全等方面花费的费用。因此，与国家有联系的资本家可以赚取比他们在工具联系上投资的更多的钱（M'p）。因此，在政治领域，或国家资本关系中，资本家从事所谓的政治资本循环：Mp _ Cp _ M'p（下标‘p’代表政治）。 3 国家行为者的代理 资本家利用与国家行为者的联系。但这些联系是与相对于给定资本家或一群资本家有一定自主权的国家行为者的联系。国家自主性的一个主要原因是大多数国家理论所指出的（如第2章所讨论的）：个别资本家通常不需要在经济交易中对其他资本家或其工人施加强制，这有助于国家相对于个别资本家享有一定程度的自主性。此外，正如克里文（Creaven，2000年：267页）所说，“政权相对于统治阶级的直接控制的相对自主性在发达资本主义社会获得一种始终如一的高形式，和最稳定的形式”，因为“这里的生产力足够先进以支持一个独立的‘非生产性’的中央行政机构在全国范围内”。"},{"prompt":"SpongeBob KravaratGlany is one of several Treacian dubs of SpongeBob SquarePants.

Primarily, mods are installed through the Minecraft Forge tool, which is essentially a mod itself that allows you to easily manage other mods. Here's a step-by-step guide: # Pre-requisites 1. **Java**: Minecraft mods require Java to run. Most Linux distributions include OpenJDK, which is sufficient for Minecraft and Forge. You can check your Java version by opening a terminal and typing: \`java -version\`. If Java is not installed, you can usually install it via your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based distributions: \`sudo apt install default-jdk\`. 2. **Minecraft**: Ensure you have Minecraft installed. Minecraft for Linux is available as a .deb package from the official website, or you can use the Minecraft Launcher from Mojang. If you're using a distribution that does not support .deb packages, you may need to use an alternative method to install Minecraft. # Installing Minecraft Forge 1. **Download Forge**: Go to the [official Forge website](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) and download the installer version for the Minecraft version you want to mod. Ensure to choose the \\"Installer\\" option. 2. **Install Forge**: - Once the Forge installer is downloaded, you can run it using Java. First, navigate to your Downloads directory or wherever you saved the Forge installer. - Open a terminal in that directory. - Run the Forge installer with Java by typing \`java -jar forge-installer.jar\` replacing \`forge-installer.jar\` with the actual file name of the Forge installer you downloaded. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Forge. 3. **Run Minecraft with Forge**: Open the Minecraft Launcher. Select the profile that Forge created; if it didn't create one automatically, you might have to add a new one with the Forge version selected. Launch the game to ensure Forge loads correctly. You should see a \\"Mods\\" button on the main screen. # Installing Mods 1. **Find Mods**: Download the mods you want to install. A popular source is [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods). Make sure the mods are compatible with the version of Forge and Minecraft you are running. 2. **Install Mods**: - Mods are installed by placing their files into the Minecraft \\"mods\\" folder. - Locate or create the \\"mods\\" folder: - If you've already run Minecraft with Forge installed, a \\"mods\\" folder will have been created in your Minecraft directory. - The typical location for the Minecraft folder in Linux is \`~/.minecraft\`, where \\"~\\" is your home directory. - If the \\"mods\\" folder doesn't exist, create it within the \`.minecraft\` directory. - Copy the downloaded mod files (usually \`.jar\` files) directly into the \\"mods\\" folder. 3. **Verify Mods**: Start Minecraft again using the Forge profile. Check the \\"Mods\\" menu to see if your installed mods are listed. # Additional Notes - **Compatibility**: Ensure all mods and Forge versions are compatible with your Minecraft version. - **Troubleshooting**: If Minecraft crashes, it might be due to a mod conflict. Try removing mods one by one to find the problematic mod. - **Updates**: Regularly check for updates to both Forge and your mods, as updates can fix bugs or incompatibilities. These steps should help you install mods for Minecraft on Linux. Enjoy your modded Minecraft experience!"},{"prompt":"why my minecraft directory is /home/han/snap/mc-installer/622","completion":"If your Minecraft directory is located at \`/home/han/snap/mc-installer/622\`, it indicates that you installed Minecraft using Snap on a Linux system. Snap is a package management and software deployment system developed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. It aims to provide a sandboxed, cross-platform, and dependency-free environment for applications to run. Here are a few reasons and implications of this setup: # Why Snap? 1. **Sandboxing**: Snap packages are sandboxed from the rest of your system, meaning they are designed to be isolated for security reasons. This isolation can affect how applications within snaps interact with the rest of your system, including accessing files and directories outside their own snap environment. 2. **Easy Installation**: Snap packages are meant to simplify the installation process. Installing a Snap package can be easier for users, especially those who might be less familiar with Linux's traditional package managers like \`apt\`, \`yum\`, or \`zypper\`. 3. **Automatic Updates**: Snap applications are updated automatically in the background, ensuring that users always have the latest version. This is particularly advantageous for games and software where regular updates are common. # Implications for Minecraft Modding When Minecraft is installed via Snap, the default directory for Minecraft (\`~/.minecraft\`) does not apply. Instead, Minecraft and its related files are stored within the Snap's isolated filesystem, in your case being \`/home/han/snap/mc-installer/622\`. This alternate directory structure means a few things for modding: - **Locating the Mods Folder**: The mods folder will be under the Snap directory instead of the usual \`.minecraft\` directory. Depending on how the Snap version of Minecraft is configured, you might find it directly under \`/home/han/snap/mc-installer/622\` or within a subdirectory that mimics the traditional \`.minecraft\` structure. - **Permissions Issues**: Sometimes, the sandboxed nature of snaps can cause permission issues, especially when trying to add or modify files within the snap's filesystem. You might need to adjust permissions or manage files differently than with a traditional installation. - **Forge and Other Tools**: Installing tools like Minecraft Forge, which is required for most mods, might be more complicated with a Snap installation due to the sandboxing. You may need to look for Snap-specific instructions or consider using a different installation method for Minecraft if Forge does not work as expected. # Alternatives If you're finding the Snap version of Minecraft to be incompatible with your modding needs, you might consider installing Minecraft through other methods, such as: - **Official Launcher**: Downloading the official Minecraft launcher from the Minecraft website. - **Third-party Package Managers**: Using a third-party package manager specific to your Linux distribution, which might offer a more 'traditional' installation path. Remember, modding Minecraft on Linux using a Snap installation might require different steps or adjustments because of the sandboxed nature and filesystem structure of Snap packages."},{"prompt":"how do i backup my save?","completion":"Backing up your Minecraft saves is an important step to prevent loss of your worlds due to updates, mods, or unforeseen issues. The process can vary slightly depending on the installation method (e.g., default, Snap, Flatpak), but the basic principles are the same. Below, I'll guide you through the general process and include a note on handling Snap installations like your setup. # For Standard Installations 1. **Locate the \`.minecraft\` Directory**: Your Minecraft worlds are stored in the \`.minecraft\` directory located in your home folder. You can access this folder by enabling the visibility of hidden files in your file manager (often done by pressing \`Ctrl\` + \`H\`) or by using a terminal. 2. **Access \`saves\` Folder**: Inside the \`.minecraft\` directory, find the \`saves\` folder. This folder contains all your Minecraft worlds. 3. **Copy World Folders**: You can back up individual worlds by copying their corresponding folders found within the \`saves\` folder. Select the folders you want to backup, right-click and choose \\"Copy\\" or use command-line interface (CLI) commands in the terminal. 4. **Paste to Backup Location**: Navigate to the location where you want to keep your backups, right-click and choose \\"Paste\\", or use the \`cp\` command in the terminal. Ensure your backup location is on a different drive, an external storage device, or a cloud storage service to ensure safety from local hardware failures. # For Snap Installations Your Minecraft installation directory through Snap (\`/home/han/snap/mc-installer/622\`) suggests a different path for accessing your worlds. 1. **Navigate to Snap Minecraft Directory**: Open your file manager or terminal and go to \`/home/han/snap/mc-installer/622\` or the relevant version if it differs. If you're using the terminal, you can \`cd\` into the directory. 2. **Locate the Saves**: Inside, look for the Minecraft \`saves\` directory. The exact path might slightly vary, but it should be structured similarly to a standard \`.minecraft\` installation. You might need to explore folders like \`minecraft\` or similar. 3. **Backup Process**: The process for backing up from here is the same as for standard installations: copy the folders from the \`saves\` directory and paste them into your chosen backup location. # General Tips - **Regular Backups**: Make it a habit to regularly backup your saves, especially before installing new mods or updates. - **Cloud Storage**: Consider using cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive for backing up your saves. This adds an extra layer of security by having off-site backups. - **External Drives**: Backing up to an external hard drive or USB flash drive is a simple way to ensure you have a physical copy of your saves. - **Scripting Backups**: If you're comfortable with scripting, you can automate the backup process using simple bash scripts and cron jobs on Linux. Remember, the key to successful backups is regularity and redundancy. Ensure your worlds are backed up frequently and stored in multiple locations when possible."},{"prompt":"detail instruction to install forge","completion":"Installing Minecraft Forge allows you to run mods on your Minecraft server or client.

Since you mentioned playing on low settings for maximum performance and competitive reasons, let's explore this issue from multiple angles to help you find a solution: 1. **Resolution and Render Scale**: Ensure you're playing the game at the native resolution of your monitor. Playing at a lower resolution can make games look blurry or pixelated. Also, check in-game settings for a 'Render Scale' or similar option, which adjusts the game's internal rendering resolution. If it's set below 100%, the game can appear blurry. 2. **Antialiasing Settings**: Antialiasing is designed to smooth out jagged edges but can sometimes cause a game to look blurry, especially at lower settings like FXAA. Check your game and NVIDIA Control Panel settings. You might want to experiment with turning it off in-game and forcing it through the NVIDIA Control Panel, or trying different antialiasing options to see which gives the best clarity. 3. **NVIDIA Control Panel Settings**: The NVIDIA Control Panel offers several options that can affect game clarity, such as antialiasing, anisotropic filtering, and texture filtering. Ensure these are configured for optimal performance and clarity. Sometimes, setting Texture Filtering to \\"High Performance\\" can make textures look worse. Try adjusting these settings incrementally to see what works best for your games. 4. **In-Game Settings**: While playing at low settings helps with performance, some settings can make games look significantly worse when minimized. Experiment with increasing the quality of textures and see if that improves the game's appearance without a substantial hit to performance. Also, look into any \\"Sharpness\\" settings either in the game or through NVIDIA's control panel or GeForce Experience. 5. **Dynamic Resolution or FidelityFX CAS**: Some games offer dynamic resolution scaling or use AMD's FidelityFX CAS to boost performance. These can sometimes cause a blurry image. If available, adjust these settings or disable them to see if it improves image quality. 6. **Monitor Settings**: Sometimes, the issue could be with your monitor's settings. Make sure your monitor is set to its native resolution and refresh rate. Also, explore any sharpness settings on the monitor itself, which can affect image clarity. 7. **Graphics Driver Update**: Ensure your NVIDIA drivers are up to date. A driver update can resolve numerous issues and sometimes improve game performance and visual quality. 8. **Display Cable and Port**: Check your display cable (HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.) and port. A faulty cable or using a lower bandwidth cable/port (e.g., HDMI 1.4 instead of HDMI 2.0) can impact the image quality. 9. **In-Game Motion Blur**: If your games look fine while standing still but get blurry when moving, check if there's a motion blur setting in the game and try disabling it. 10. **Background Processes**: Ensure no background processes are significantly eating into your system resources, as they can cause performance issues leading to dropped frames or lower rendering quality in some games, which might be perceived as blurriness. By systematically going through these suggestions, you can identify and solve the issue causing your games to look blurry or pixelated. Remember, finding the right balance between performance and visual quality can be a process of trial and error, especially on systems optimized for competitive gaming."},{"prompt":"كخبير فيي مجال صناعة المحتوى على يوتيوب اريد ان تكتب سكريب فيديو يتحدث عن شرح لموقع huggingface و خاصتا اهم المميزات التي يقدمها للمستخدمين اريد ان يكون سكريبت احترافي و به العديد من التفاصيل","completion":"مقدمة: مرحباً بكم متابعي قناتنا الأعزاء، في حلقة اليوم سنتحدث عن إحدى التقنيات الثورية في عالم الذكاء الاصطناعي، وهو موقع Hugging Face. إذا كنت باحثًا، مطورًا، أو حتى مهتمًا بالتطورات الجديدة في مجال الذكاء الاصطناعي، فأنت في المكان الصحيح. سنغوص معًا في أعماق هذا الموقع لنكتشف مميزاته الفريدة وكيف يمكن أن يكون موردًا قيمًا لمشاريعك. فلنبدأ!

Der FSRS passt diese Intervalle basierend auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad eines Lerninhalts sowie auf den Lernerfolg des Schülers an. Wenn ein Schüler ein Stück Information als einfach einstuft, wird er dieses seltener wiederholen müssen. Wenn ein Schüler ein Stück Information als schwierig einstuft, wird er es öfter wiederholen müssen. Der FSRS verwendet auch andere Faktoren wie die Zeit, die seit der letzten Wiederholung vergangen ist, um zu bestimmen, wann der beste Zeitpunkt für eine erneute Wiederholung ist. Dieser Ansatz hilft Schülern, Informationen effektiver zu behalten und zu lernen. Insgesamt hilft der FSRS dabei, den Lernprozess zu optimieren, indem er den Zeitpunkt der Wiederholung von Informationen auf intelligente und effiziente Weise plant.

The year was marked by continued discussions and concerns over population growth, which influenced international policies and research. 6. **Economic Conditions** - The world economy faced challenges in 1974, stemming in part from the 1973 oil crisis. The resulting energy shortages and price increases contributed to inflation and economic stagnation in many countries, a period known as stagflation. 7. **Cyprus Conflict** - In 1974, tensions in Cyprus led to a coup by Greek Cypriot nationalists who sought union with Greece. This prompted Turkey to invade Cyprus, leading to a military conflict and the eventual division of the island into the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (recognized only by Turkey). 8. **World Series of Poker** - The annual World Series of Poker (WSOP) held in Las Vegas saw significant growth in popularity, reflecting the increasing interest in professional poker playing.

Reflection API в Java позволяет анализировать классы, интерфейсы, поля и методы во время выполнения. Ниже приведен пример такой программы. В этом примере мы создадим два класса: один будет целевым классом, о котором мы хотим получить информацию (например \`MyClass\`), а другой будет выполнять анализ с использованием Reflection API (например \`ClassAnalyzer\`). \`\`\`java import java.lang.reflect.Constructor; import java.lang.reflect.Field; import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.lang.reflect.Modifier; class MyClass { public int publicField; private String privateField; public MyClass() {} public MyClass(int a, String b) { this.publicField = a; this.privateField = b; } public void publicMethod() {} private void privateMethod() {} } public class ClassAnalyzer { public static void main(String[] args) { analyzeClass(MyClass.class); } public static void analyzeClass(Class<?> cls) { System.out.println(\\"Class: \\" + cls.getName()); // Поля Field[] fields = cls.getDeclaredFields(); System.out.println(\\"Number of fields: \\" + fields.length); for (Field field : fields) { System.out.println(\\"Field name: \\" + field.getName() + \\", Access: \\" + Modifier.toString(field.getModifiers())); } // Конструкторы Constructor<?>[] constructors = cls.getDeclaredConstructors(); System.out.println(\\"nNumber of constructors: \\" + constructors.length); for (Constructor<?> constructor : constructors) { System.out.println(\\"Constructor: \\" + constructor.toString()); } // Методы Method[] methods = cls.getDeclaredMethods(); System.out.println(\\"nNumber of methods: \\" + methods.length); for (Method method : methods) { System.out.println(\\"Method name: \\" + method.getName() + \\", Access: \\" + Modifier.toString(method.getModifiers())); } } } \`\`\` Данный код анализирует класс \`MyClass\`, собирая информацию о его полях, конструкторах и методах. Используется Reflection API, чтобы получить доступ к компонентам класса и их модификаторам. Учтите, что в реальных приложениях частое использование Reflection может приводить к снижению производительности и уменьшению безопасности или стабильности программы, поэтому используйте его с осторожностью."},{"prompt":"Поля, помеченные аннотацией @JsonIgnore, должны игнорироваться. напиши класс этой аннотации","completion":"Чтобы поля, помеченные аннотацией \`@JsonIgnore\`, игнорировались в вашей программе, вам сначала нужно определить эту аннотацию. В Java аннотацию можно определить, используя символ \`@\` перед ключевым словом \`interface\`. Поскольку мы хотим, чтобы аннотация \`@JsonIgnore\` могла применяться к полям класса, мы должны указать это с помощью аннотации \`@Target(ElementType.FIELD)\`. Кроме того, мы хотим, чтобы информация об этой аннотации была доступна во время выполнения через Reflection API, поэтому используем \`@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\`. Ниже приведен пример определения аннотации \`@JsonIgnore\`: \`\`\`java import java.lang.annotation.ElementType; import java.lang.annotation.Retention; import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy; import java.lang.annotation.Target; @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.FIELD) public @interface JsonIgnore { } \`\`\` Теперь, когда у нас есть аннотация \`@JsonIgnore\`, мы можем использовать её для пометки полей в классах, информацию о которых хотим исключить из анализа. Вот пример класса, использующего эту аннотацию: \`\`\`java public class MyClass { public int visibleField; @JsonIgnore private String ignoredField; public MyClass() {} public MyClass(int visible, String ignored) { this.visibleField = visible; this.ignoredField = ignored; } // Методы... } \`\`\` Следуя вашему первоначальному вопросу о написании программы для анализа класса, мы теперь должны модифицировать метод \`analyzeClass\` так, чтобы он игнорировал поля, помеченные \`@JsonIgnore\`. Ниже приведен обновленный фрагмент метода \`analyzeClass\`, исключающий такие поля: \`\`\`java import java.lang.reflect.Field; import java.lang.reflect.Modifier; // Внутри класса ClassAnalyzer: public static void analyzeClass(Class<?> cls) { System.out.println(\\"Class: \\" + cls.getName()); // Поля Field[] fields = cls.getDeclaredFields(); System.out.println(\\"Number of fields: \\" + fields.length); for (Field field : fields) { if (!field.isAnnotationPresent(JsonIgnore.class)) { // Проверяем, присутствует ли аннотация @JsonIgnore System.out.println(\\"Field name: \\" + field.getName() + \\", Access: \\" + Modifier.toString(field.getModifiers())); } } // Код для конструкторов и методов... } \`\`\` Теперь ваша программа корректно определит и игнорирует поля, помеченные аннотацией \`@JsonIgnore\`, при анализе классов."},{"prompt":"что должно быть внутри public @interface JsonIgnore { }","completion":"Аннотация \`@JsonIgnore\` обычно используется, чтобы указать, что определённое поле класса не должно сериализоваться, например, при преобразовании объекта в JSON. В контексте Java и библиотек сериализации, таких как Jackson, аннотация \`@JsonIgnore\` уже реализована и доступна для использования. Однако, если вы решите создать свою собственную аннотацию \`@JsonIgnore\` для специфических нужд (например, для учебного проекта или из-за требований, которые не покрываются стандартными средствами), ваша реализация может не требовать вставки кода внутри тела аннотации. В простейшем случае, если аннотация используется исключительно как маркер, который затем обрабатывается при помощи Reflection API, аннотация \`@JsonIgnore\` может быть полностью пустой: \`\`\`java import java.lang.annotation.ElementType; import java.lang.annotation.Retention; import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy; import java.lang.annotation.Target; @Target(ElementType.FIELD) // Указывает, что аннотацию можно применять только к полям @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) // Указывает, что аннотация доступна во время исполнения public @interface JsonIgnore { // Пустое тело: аннотация используется только как маркер и не содержит элементов } \`\`\` Атрибуты (или элементы) внутри аннотации позволяют предоставить дополнительную информацию, которую можно использовать при обработке аннотации. Например, можно было бы расширить функциональность аннотации \`@JsonIgnore\` элементами, позволяющими указывать условия, при которых поле должно игнорироваться: \`\`\`java public @interface JsonIgnore { boolean ignore() default true; // Элемент аннотации, который может быть использован для указания, должно ли поле игнорироваться } \`\`\` В этом случае, при использовании аннотации, можно было бы явно указывать, игнорировать поле или нет: \`\`\`java @JsonIgnore(ignore = true) private String myField; \`\`\` Тем не менее, в базовом случае для реализации логики игнорирования полей достаточно простой аннотации без внутренних элементов."},{"prompt":"paint a picture of a nice person","completion":"Imagine a person whose presence is like a warm embrace on a chilly morning. They stand there, with a gentle smile that lights up their face, making their eyes crinkle at the corners. This smile, it seems, is their ever-present accessory, a symbol of their kind and welcoming nature. Their attire adds to their approachable demeanor. They wear clothing that seems to hug them comfortably, in soft, inviting colors that speak of their easy-going personality. Perhaps a cozy sweater that seems to say, \\"Here for a chat?\\" or a simple, neat outfit that whispers of quiet confidence and openness. As they interact with those around them, their kindness shines through in their actions and words. They listen intently, their gaze fixed on the speaker, nodding and offering words of encouragement or understanding. Their language is gentle, imbued with respect and a genuine interest in others' well-being. It's not just what they say but how they say it—their tone warm, enriching even the most mundane conversations with a sense of importance and care. In their gestures, too, lies a grace that accentuates their niceness. They reach out with soft, reassuring touches, a pat on the back here, a gentle squeeze of the shoulder there, communicating support and comfort without the need for words. Their movements are measured and deliberate, devoid of any sharpness, reflecting the thoughtfulness with which they approach the world. This person carries an aura of positivity, a subtle strength that seems to draw others into their circle of warmth. Their laughter is infectious, a melodious sound that bubbles up from a well of joy and spreads to those around them, lightening the atmosphere. Yet, their niceness does not overshadow their authenticity. They are unafraid to show vulnerability, to admit mistakes, and to seek help, making it all the easier for others to relate to and connect with them. Their kindness is not a facade, but a deeply ingrained part of who they are, shining brightly through their actions, large and small. In essence, this nice person is like a beacon of light in a oftentimes dim world, guiding, supporting, and uplifting those fortunate enough to cross their path."},{"prompt":"как скрыть онлайн вк","completion":"Чтобы скрыть свой онлайн-статус в социальной сети ВКонтакте, нужно выполнить следующие шаги: 1.

This could range from sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) to spam detection (spam, not spam), topic categorization (sports, politics, technology), or intent detection (question, command, statement). 2. **Collect Data**: Assemble a dataset that includes text examples for each class or category you wish to identify. This can involve collecting documents, scraping webpages, or using pre-existing datasets. 3. **Preprocess the Data**: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis. This involves tasks such as: - Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens. - Removing stop words: These are common words like \\"the\\", \\"is\\", \\"in\\", which are usually removed as they don't carry significant meaning for classification. - Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form. - Vectorization: Converting text into numerical format so machine learning algorithms can understand it. Techniques include Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or more advanced embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT embeddings. 4. **Choose a Model**: Select a machine learning or deep learning model to classify the text. Common choices include: - Naive Bayes - Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Logistic Regression - Random Forest - Neural Networks, especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text - Transformer-based models like BERT for more complex tasks 5. **Train the Model**: Feed the preprocessed data into the model and adjust the model’s parameters until it can accurately predict the class of the input text. This step involves dividing your dataset into at least a training set and a validation set to tune the model without overfitting. 6. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model’s performance using the test set (a subset of the data not seen by the model during training) and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In classification tasks, a confusion matrix can also provide insight into the model's performance across different categories. 7. **Improve the Model**: Based on the evaluation, iterate over the model by tuning hyperparameters, using more sophisticated models, enlarging the dataset, or further refining the data preprocessing steps to improve accuracy. 8. **Deploy the Model**: Once satisfied with the model’s performance, it can be deployed into a production environment where it can classify new, unseen text according to the categories learned during training. Throughout these steps, it's crucial to maintain a focus on the domain-specific nuances of your data and task, as these can significantly impact the choice of preprocessing steps, models, and ultimately the success of your text classification efforts."},{"prompt":"2004","completion":"It seems like you're referring to the year 2004, but without more context, it's difficult to provide a specific answer.

Il a encore une plaie. Malheureusement, il enlève tout le temps sa collerette et ses pansements. Est-ce dangereux s'il lèche sa plaie après qu'on ait mis sur cette dernière un désinfectant ?","completion":"Il est assez fréquent que les chats essaient de retirer leur collerette ou leurs pansements, car cela peut leur sembler inconfortable ou irritant. Néanmoins, il est important de faire en sorte que la plaie reste propre et protégée pour prévenir les infections et permettre une guérison correcte. Lécher une plaie peut être problématique pour plusieurs raisons, surtout après l'application d'un désinfectant : 1. **Infection :** La bouche des chats contient des bactéries qui peuvent infecter la plaie. Bien que le léchage puisse sembler être une méthode de nettoyage naturelle pour les chats, cela peut en fait introduire des bactéries dans une plaie ouverte et causer une infection. 2. **Irritation :** Certains désinfectants ou médicaments topiques peuvent être irritants pour la langue ou la bouche du chat s'ils sont ingérés. Cela peut causer de l'inconfort ou une réaction adverse chez votre chat. 3. **Retard de guérison :** Le léchage excessif peut également retarder la guérison de la plaie en empêchant la formation d'une croûte protectrice et en rouvrant constamment la plaie. Si votre chat enlève constamment sa collerette et ses pansements, voici quelques suggestions : - **Consultez votre vétérinaire** pour vous assurer qu'il n'y a pas de raison médicale (comme une réaction allergique ou une irritation due au pansement ou à la désinfection) pour laquelle votre chat essaie d'accéder à la plaie. - **Demandez des alternatives** : Il existe différents types de collerettes et de protections qui pourraient être plus confortables et moins faciles à enlever pour votre chat. Par exemple, il existe des collerettes souples ou des vêtements protecteurs selon l'emplacement de la plaie. - **Surveillance** : Essayez de surveiller votre chat autant que possible pour empêcher le léchage. Offrez-lui des distractions, comme des jouets ou des séances de jeu, pour détourner son attention de la plaie. - Votre vétérinaire peut également recommander un produit qui est sûr même si le chat lèche la plaie après l'application. Il est crucial de ne jamais utiliser de désinfectant ou de médicament sans l'avis d'un professionnel.

However, I will attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis based on the information given. # MBTI: INTJ or INFJ - Both of these types are intuitive and tend to focus on the future and underlying patterns. Trust issues might stem from their Ni (Introverted Intuition), leading to either a deep understanding or skepticism of motives and outcomes. They think extensively before placing trust. # Enneagram: Type 6 (The Loyalist) - Type 6 is characterized by skepticism, loyalty, and being security-oriented. Trust issues are central to Type 6, who constantly battles with fear and seeks assurance, but also doubts the intentions of others. # Temperament: Melancholic - The Melancholic temperament is analytical, detail-oriented, and can be prone to worrying. Individuals with this temperament may have trust issues due to their propensity to overthink and their sensitivity to potential threats or betrayals. # Big Five: - **Extraversion: Low** (Introversion is more likely since they may keep to themselves and be wary of initiating too many social connections.) - **Neuroticism: High** (Having trust issues may be a reflection of higher anxiety and emotional volatility.) - **Conscientiousness: High** (Attention to detail and cautiousness in forming relationships could indicate a higher level of conscientious behavior.) - **Agreeableness: Low** (Skepticism and trust issues can correlate with being less trusting and cooperative.) - **Openness: Moderate** (While being cautious, they might still be curious about understanding different perspectives or ideas, perhaps in an attempt to mitigate their trust issues.) # Socionics: ILI (INTp) - The ILI, or Intuitive Logical Introvert, often aligns with the MBTI's INTJ. They are strategic, private, and value autonomy, which might contribute to trust issues due to their discerning and sometimes skeptical nature. # Instinctual Variant: sp/sx (Self-Preservation/Sexual) - The self-preservation instinct might dominate due to the inherent focus on personal safety and well-being, which manifests in cautious interpersonal relationships. The sexual variant as secondary emphasizes building deeper connections, hinting at a desire to trust despite underlying fears. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin or Ravenclaw - Slytherin, because of their cautious, resourceful nature and the importance they place on loyalty within their close-knit group. Ravenclaw might also fit due to their analytical approach to the world, which could include analyzing the trustworthiness of those around them. # Moral Alignment: Lawful Neutral - This alignment suggests a person who follows a personal code or system, which might include cautiousness or skepticism as a means to protect oneself and maintain order in their life, rather than trusting others outright. It's important to remember that these are theoretical interpretations and real human personalities are far more nuanced and complex. Individuals might not fit neatly into these categories, and their experiences, upbringing, and personal growth can significantly influence their trust in consensus or collective agreement."},{"prompt":"Assign \\"another person causes consensus has trust issues\\" with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","completion":"Interpreting \\"another person causes consensus has trust issues\\" to various personality assessments reflects a scenario where an individual is the source of skepticism or distrust among others. This assignment focuses on traits that might lead someone to challenge consensus and evoke trust issues within a group. # MBTI: ENTJ or ESTJ - These types are assertive, leadership-oriented, and often challenge the status quo, which could disturb consensus if their approach is perceived as too forceful or if they appear to have ulterior motives. # Enneagram: Type 8 (The Challenger) - Type 8s are assertive, confrontational, and protect their vulnerability by controlling their environment, which can include challenging consensus and causing others to question trust. # Temperament: Choleric - The Choleric temperament is characterized by ambition, energy, and a propensity to take charge, which could easily disrupt consensus and stir trust issues, especially if their actions seem self-serving. # Big Five: - **Extraversion: High** (They engage actively with their environment and are outspoken, traits that can lead to consensus challenges.) - **Neuroticism: Moderate** (While they may not be inherently anxious, their actions could stem from underlying personal insecurities or desires for control.) - **Conscientiousness: High** (Their decisive and direct approach to challenging consensus reflects a driven and purposeful nature.) - **Agreeableness: Low** (Being challenging and less concerned with harmony can correlate with lower agreeableness.) - **Openness: Moderate to High** (They are willing to explore new ideas and challenge existing ones, though not always for purely innovative reasons.) # Socionics: LIE (ENTj) - The Logical Intuitive Extrovert in Socionics correlates with the assertive and strategic nature of ENTJs in MBTI, capable of disrupting consensus through their directness and ambition. # Instinctual Variant: so/sp (Social/Self-Preservation) - The social instinct is primary, indicating a keen awareness of group dynamics and the potential to influence or disrupt for personal or broader objectives. Self-preservation highlights a desire to maintain personal security and influence. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - Resourcefulness, ambition, and a strong sense of loyalty to their chosen group characterize Slytherin, fitting for someone whose actions challenge consensus, either for personal gain or a perceived greater good. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Neutral - This alignment suggests acting independently and valuing personal freedom above conforming to traditional moral axes. Their actions may not be inherently good or evil but challenge consensus and trust due to personal principles or desires for autonomy. When assessing these attributes, it's crucial to recognize that they are theoretical and emphasize certain traits that could lead to challenging consensus and causing trust issues. Personalities are multi-faceted, and behaviors could be influenced by numerous factors, including context, personal goals, and interpersonal dynamics."},{"prompt":"Assign \\"main criminal\\" with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","completion":"Designating a \\"main criminal\\" personality type using various psychological and fictional classification systems requires a speculative approach, aiming to highlight traits commonly associated with manipulative or antisocial behavior. It's essential to note that in reality, criminal behavior is complex and influenced by numerous factors, including environment, upbringing, mental health, and more. No personality framework can accurately predict or explain criminal behavior in all its nuances. However, for a theoretical and generalized interpretation: # MBTI: ESTP or INTJ - ESTPs are often labeled as the ultimate realists and risk-takers, potentially leading to impulsive criminal behavior. INTJs might represent the \\"criminal mastermind,\\" due to their strategic thinking and sometimes, a personal moral code that defies conventional norms. # Enneagram: Type 8 (The Challenger) or Type 3 (The Achiever) - Type 8s are assertive, confrontational, and seek control, sometimes disregarding ethical standards to achieve their goals. Type 3s, motivated by a desire to succeed and be admired, might resort to unethical actions if they deem them necessary for success. # Temperament: Choleric - The Choleric temperament is ambitious, energetic, and inclined towards leadership. This can correlate with criminal behavior if it's directed towards self-serving or unethical endeavors. # Big Five: - **Extraversion: High** (Criminals often need to engage with others to manipulate or exert control.) - **Neuroticism: High or Low** (Depending on whether their behavior is impulsively risk-taking or coldly calculated.) - **Conscientiousness: Low** (A lack of regard for rules and impulsivity) or High (in cases of highly organized criminal activity). - **Agreeableness: Very Low** (Antisocial behavior, lack of empathy.) - **Openness: High** (Willingness to break norms and try unconventional approaches.) # Socionics: SLE (ESTp) or LII (INTj) - SLEs are direct, forceful, and seek to make an impact on their environment, which can play into criminal behavior. LIIs strategize and plan, potentially applying their intellect in manipulative ways. # Instinctual Variant: sp/sx or sx/sp - Self-Preservation (sp) as a primary instinct could relate to engaging in criminal acts for personal gain or security. Sexual (sx) instinct focuses on intensity and might drive someone towards criminal acts for the thrill or power. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - Resourcefulness, cunning, ambition, and a tendency towards self-preservation are Slytherin traits that could theoretically align with the qualities of a \\"main criminal\\" in a fictional narrative. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Evil or Neutral Evil - Chaotic Evil acts on personal whims and a disregard for laws and morality. Neutral Evil is selfish and may obey authority if it suits them but has no qualms about stepping over others to achieve their goals. This portrayal is highly theoretical and for entertainment and educational purposes only. Real criminal behavior is a result of a complex interplay of individual traits, societal context, opportunities, and many other factors beyond personality type."},{"prompt":"Assign \\"criminal to rebel achieve post-economic world\\" with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","completion":"For a character that embodies a \\"criminal to rebel to achieve a post-economic world\\" archetype, we're looking for personality traits that align with rebelliousness, vision for societal restructuring, and potentially, a disregard for current laws and norms to achieve a greater good. This character is committed to radical change and believes the ends justify the means. # MBTI: INTP or ENTJ - **INTP** individuals are known for their innovative ideas, logical thinking, and preference for working outside conventional systems when these systems impede progress. - **ENTJ** types are strategic leaders who are decisive and have a clear vision of what they want and how to get it. They're willing to make tough calls and lead revolutionary changes if they believe in the cause. # Enneagram: Type 1w9 (The Idealist) or 8w7 (The Maverick) - **Type 1w9** combines a strong sense of right and wrong (1) with a desire for peace and unity (9), reflecting someone who aims for large-scale societal change. - **Type 8w7** offers the assertiveness and decisiveness to challenge existing structures, combined with a high-energy approach (7) to pursuing their vision. # Temperament: Choleric-Melancholic - The **Choleric** aspect contributes leadership, boldness, and a propensity for action. - The **Melancholic** aspect provides thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and a deeper consideration for the societal impact of their actions. # Big Five: - **Extraversion: Moderate** (Leadership and communication requirements suggest not too introverted but balanced with strategic solitude.) - **Neuroticism: Low to Moderate** (Stress-resilient and focused but with an underlying passion for their cause that may occasionally surface as anxiety or frustration.) - **Conscientiousness: High** (Very goal-oriented, disciplined in pursuit of their revolutionary ideals.) - **Agreeableness: Low** (Willing to confront societal norms and potentially upset people to achieve their vision.) - **Openness: Very High** (Creative, open to new ideas, and driven to overhaul the existing economic system.) # Socionics: ILI (INTp) or LIE (ENTj) - The **ILI** is strategic, often focused on long-term goals, capable of identifying systemic flaws, and envisioning profound changes. - The **LIE** is entrepreneurial, decisive, and driven, skilled at marshaling resources and people to enact their vision. # Instinctual Variant: sx/sp or sp/sx - The **sx/sp** variant focuses on intense personal connections and individual transformation, fueling a passion for societal change. - The **sp/sx** variant combines self-preservation with the drive to create close alliances, securing resources and allies necessary for their cause. # Hogwarts House: Gryffindor or Ravenclaw - **Gryffindor** for their bravery, willingness to stand up for what they believe is right, and take action against perceived injustices. - **Ravenclaw** for their innovative thoughts, value on wisdom, and dedication to planning a better world through intellectual overhaul. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Good - Believes in freedom as a higher ideal and is willing to break the laws and norms of the current system to achieve a perceived greater good.

Yuntai relinquishes his [Yuntai's] claim to the Chinese throne and [Yuntai] allows his [Yuntai's] children and [Yuntai's] siblings to be absorbed into the Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Han China after the National Protection war is an event later compared to the 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute Imperial Royal parliamentary monarchy but de jure feudal royal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan |the sei-i taishōgun| during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 in Japanese history who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], the collection of various powers that supported the shogunates and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, [the Tokugawa bakufu] ruling [the Tokugawa bakufu] over Japan and Okinawa, [the Meiji Restoration in the Tokugawa bakufu] that [the Meiji Restoration] allowed the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty to [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] reclaim its [the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] executive power over the Japanese government and [the Meiji Restoration] dissolved the Tokugawa shogunate and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the formation of the post-1868, pre-1947 the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary Imperial parliamentary democratic Royal monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Third Japanese Empire/Great Japan/Imperial Japan/Empire of Japan ruling [the Great Japanese Empire] over [the Great Japanese Empire's territories] the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Russia's Sahalkin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands, Okinawa/Ryūkū, the Caroline's, the Marinas and Palau from [the Great Japanese Empire's homebase and stronghold] the Japanese Home Islands and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the rise of Japan as a political, military, economic and industrial superpower, [the restoration of the Ming dynasty in China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China being the Chinese version of the Meiji Restoration] with the first post-1662 Chinese Emperor being compared to Japan's Emperor Meiji and Sun-Yat-Sen and Yuan Shikai being both compared to the Japanese reformers that helped Meiji initiate the Meiji Restoration. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid. The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army within Han China, [the Beiyang Army being built from both the Manchu and Han units of the New Army] after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Beiyang Army] is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. Manchuria, which [Manchuria] had [Manchuria] fallen [Manchuria] under the control of [which faction took over Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit clique/military junta/Han Chinese government faction of the Fengtian Clique headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the Fengtian Clique's leader] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhang] known [Zhang] as [Zhang] \\"the Old Marshal\\", [Manchuria falling under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] despite the Qing Imperial Court continuing [the Qing Imperial court] to [the Qing Imperial court] exist in Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution, [post-Xinhai Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becomes a protectorate [post-Xinhai Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] of the Great Japanese Empire during the National Protection War and the subsequent restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China after Shikai's and Yat-Sen's death. The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria. Zhuolin's eldest son and his [Zhuolin's] heir to the leadership to the Beiyang Clique and thus of post-Xinhai Revolution, the pro-KMT, pro-Chinese unification, anti-Japanese Zhang Xueliang, [Xueliang] is [Xueliang] sent [Xueliang] to the restored Ming dynasty after Zhuolin's death via [Zhuolin's death] having his [Zhuolin's train] bombed, [Xueliang being sent to the restored Ming dynasty] in 1928. The New People's Society, a political organ [the New People's Society] that [the New People's Society] was [the New People's Society] designed [the New People's Society] to spread the Chinese government's [Reorganized Government of the Empire of China's] ideas to the Chinese public and [the New People's Society] mobilize economic and military support for the Chinese Reorganized Government and Japan, while [the new People's Society] training future civil servants, sending Chinese students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Han Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily with the core values emphasized were Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship, [the New People's Society] proves useful in getting the Chinese people to [the Chinese people] support the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and Japan When Yat-Sen's more famous student, the Cantonese revolutionary turned corrupt politician and then dictator who was Stalin’s puppet in China, Jiǎng Jièshí, who [Jièshí] was [Jièshí] better known as [Jièshí’s more famous alias] “Chiang Kai Shek”, [Jièshí/\\"Chiang\\"] [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí] attempts to [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek \\"in this timeline] seize control over both the KMT and Nationalist China and [Kai-Shek in this timeline] launch the 9 July 1926 – 29 December 1928 military campaign launched by the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army against both the Fengtian Clique and the Beiyang Government to reunify China, the Northern Expidition like in OTL, [Kai-Shek in this timeline attempting to seize control of Nationalist China and launch the Northern Expedition like in OTL] he [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] is [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí in this timeline] instead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] shot dead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] by a disgruntled Cantonese citizen and the ruling pro-Cantonese independence, anti-Chinese unification faction dominating the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan, [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] retakes power after Kai-Shek's death and [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] calls off the Northern Expedition. The Northern Expedition failing unlike in OTL allows Nationalist China, Manchukuo the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire to [Nationalist China, Manchukuo, the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire] survive post-1947 into the later half of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond. The restored Ming dynasty does take Hong Kong from the British and Macau from the Portuguese after WW1 and [the restored Ming dynasty], as as the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, [the restored Ming dynasty as the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] helps the Japanese liberate the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during WW2, and also participating in the liberation of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Burma from the British colonial occupation of the British Raj. Pakistan restores the Sunni Muslim Uzbek-Mongolian Imperial House of Babur-ruled Turko-Mongol khanate and Islamic sultanate of the Mughal Empire as its [Pakistan's] government after its [Pakistan's] liberation and [Pakistan] also takes Jannu and Kashmir. India proper becomes a federation of restored Muslim princely states, Muslim tribal duties and Muslim Kingdoms under the rule of the Uzbek Sunni Muslim Asaf Jahi dynasty ruling over Hyberdad. The Japanese also still liberate Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and East Timor from French and English colonial occupation but make Indochina into a federation of Muslim sultantes, tribal duties and local Kingdoms. After the discovery of the spy ring headed by the Soviet Union's federal law enforcement agency, domestic secret police agency, and foreign intelligence service combined in one, the NKVD, more specifically NKVD agent Richard Sorge operating in Japan by the Kempeitai and the Great Japanese Empire's civilian secret police agency, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Great Japanese Empire, whose functions were criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō [Special Higher Police |Tokkō|], the IJA decides to strike North into the USSR, coinciding with the invasion of the USSR by the Nazis in 1941. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration's] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds in this timeline unlike in OTL due to both the Kempeitai and the Tokkō being [ the Kempeitai and the Tokkō in this timeline] too occupied with [ the Kempeitai and the Tokkō in this timeline] mopping up Soviet, American and British spy rings in Japan to [ the Kempeitai and the Tokkō in this timeline] notice domestic threats within Japan. Although the Shōwa Restoration succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration] in [the Shōwa Restoration] returning power to the then newly enthroned Emperor Shōwa and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy while also reducing the power of the corporate multinationals within Japan, Emperor Shōwa is [Emperor Shōwa] forced [Emperor Shōwa] to [Emperor Shōwa] make concessions to far right, Japanese nationalist Buddhist supremacist factions within Japan to [Emperor Shōwa] restore the heads of the Tokugawa clan to their [the heads' of the Tokugawa clan's] pre-1868 position as Japan's sei-i taishōgun/shoguns, although the Japanese Emperors retain executive control over the Japanese government and the restored Tokugawa sei-i taishōgun/shoguns merely control Japanese local government and [the restored Tokugawa sei-i taishōgun/shoguns] act in a manner similar to the Reichskanzlers [Imperial Chancellors/Realm Chancellors, the only responsible ministers |the Reichkanzlers| at the federal level in the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and Weimar Germany, with state secretaries in German Empire, Austria-Hungary and Weimar Germany being civil servants subordinate to the Reichskanzlers and similar to ministers] and the constitutional royal and imperial monarchs of Europe. The joint Nazi-Japanese assault causes the Soviet Union to collapse before the Allies can do anything to help the Soviet Union and Japan subsequently restores the post-WW1 Japanese protectorate of the constitutional Republic of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian Far East after the fall of the USSR. The NKVD still launches the operation known as Operation Snow which leads to the IJAF attacking Pearl Harbor in American occupied Hawaii, but as the Japanese are not overextended in China and have access to Russian Far Eastern oil and resources, the Japanese decimate Pearl Harbor and liberate all of Hawaii from American occupation. The mistaking of a secret delegation of the US Democrat Party and the Democrat Party's Street arm, the KKK to the British Empire done by the Democrats and the Klan to show that the USA will join the war on the side of the Allies for a US invasion fleet by a German private manning the then experimental German nuclear ripped ICBM arsenal leads to the atomic bombing of Washington DC, NYC, Toronto and London along with the Soviet provisional capital in Siberia and the collapse of the USA and the rump USSR, as the Democrat Party and the Klan start mass murdering evangelicals, American Republicans, Eastern Europeans and anyone who isn't a white secular Democrat as the Democrats, then unaware of nuclear power, blame the tradegy on the American religious right and the Soviets. The Allies surrender out of fear to German military might and the loss of their colonies on Asia and Oceania to the Japanese. The USA falls into a warlord period as the British, now under Nazi control seize New England and restore the Confederate States of America in the Southern United States as a part of the British Canadian dominion of British North America. The Northern United States is governed by a shaky coalition of Republicans, Evangelicals and Communists backed by former Soviet government and military figures along with refugees from the now dissolved Soviet Union.","completion":"# Chapter XII: The Dawn of the Dragon Empire: The Ming Restoration and the New Global Order The Ming Dynasty: A Beacon of Modernization and Diplomatic Ingenuity The early 20th century saw the Chinese Empire, under the Beiyang Government, undergo a transformation that was unparalleled in its history. With Yuntai renouncing his claim to the throne, a path was paved for the restoration of the Great Ming Dynasty, symbolizing not just a restoration of monarchy but a renaissance of Chinese culture, governance, and global stature. This historic event paralleled the acclaimed Meiji Restoration of Japan but was unique in its approach, blending millennium-old traditions with the urgent demands of modern statecraft and democracy. The Restoration was no mere return to old ways; it was a determined leap into the future, marked by the immediate initiation of industrial, educational, and infrastructural reforms. International cooperation flourished, with technological and financial aids primarily channeled from European powers keen on fostering a stable and prosperous China as a counterbalance to rising Japanese influence in Asia. The Beiyang Army to the Great Ming Army: A Transition Integral to the Ming Restoration was the reformation of the Beiyang Government's armed forces. Inspirations were drawn from the Ming Dynasty's military prowess but were adapted to meet contemporary standards. This modern incarnation, named the Great Ming Army, stood as a testament to China's regained sovereignty and its ambitions on the global stage. Assistance from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans was pivotal, transforming the army into a force equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry and Western military tactics, ready to defend the empire and its interests. Reconciliation and Integration: From the KMT to the Ming Government The ideological rift between the Kuomingtang (KMT) and the newly restored Ming state was bridged by reformist elements within both camps. Led by figures like Wang Jingwei, who served as Prime Minister, the government incorporated Sun Yat-Sen's principles, melding nationalism, democracy, and socialism within the fabric of the Ming Dynasty's governance. This harmonization of ideals facilitated a smooth transition to a constitutional monarchy that was democratic in spirit and function, fulfilling the long-cherished aspirations of the Xinhai Revolution. The Empire's Foreign Policy and Global Stature The Empire of China quickly adapted to the new geopolitical realities, aligning itself closely with the Japanese Empire while retaining its sovereignty and unique Chinese identity. Through astute diplomacy, the Ming state reclaimed Hong Kong and Macau, expanding its influence in Southeast Asia. Notably, it played a pivotal role in the liberation of territories under French and British colonial rule, advocating for a pan-Asian solidarity that sought to dismantle Western imperialism in the continent. Manchuria and the Qing Restoration under Japanese Aegis Interestingly, the Empire pursued a dual strategy in dealing with Manchuria. While it recognized the sovereignty of the Japanese-backed Manchukuo, a subtle support persisted for the Qing Imperial Court. This nuanced approach ensured stability on China's northeastern frontier and allowed the Empire to maintain cordial relations with Japan, leveraging these ties for greater autonomy and influence in regional affairs. The Legacy of the Restored Ming Dynasty The restoration of the Ming Dynasty represented not a simple revival of the past but a bold stride into the future. It reconciled the revolutionary ideals of democracy and nationalism with the reverence for monarchic tradition, crafting a new Chinese identity that was reflective of its rich history and dynamic future. The Empire’s effective governance, military reforms, and diplomatic maneuvers positioned it as a formidable power on the international stage, ushering in an era marked by prosperity, innovation, and an unwavering sense of Chinese pride."},{"prompt":"إعطني نص إعلاني مخصص ل sales hub في HubSpot","completion":"بالطبع! فيما يلي نص إعلاني مخصص لمنصة \\"Sales Hub\\" في HubSpot: --- هل تبحث عن طريقة فعالة لتعزيز مبيعاتك ورفع كفاءة فريقك التجاري؟ 🚀 أهلاً بك في \\"Sales Hub\\" من HubSpot – المنصة الشاملة التي تمكِّنك من تسريع دورة المبيعات وزيادة الإنتاجية بطريقة مذهلة! 🌟 قم بتحويل طريقة عملك مع أدوات مصممة بعناية لتناسب كل حجم من الأعمال: 1. **أتمتة المبيعات**: وداعًا للمهام المتكررة! قم بأتمتة عمليات البريد الإلكتروني، المهام، والمتابعات لتركيز وقتك حيث يهم حقًا - بناء العلاقات مع العملاء. 2. **رؤى وتحليلات عميقة**: استغل البيانات لصالحك برؤى متقدمة حول أداء المبيعات وتفضيلات العملاء، لتتخذ قرارات مستنيرة تعزز من نموك. 3. **إدارة قوائم العملاء المحتملين**: اكتشف وقيِّم الفرص بسهولة وكفاءة مع أدوات فرز قوائم العملاء المحتملين وتصنيفهم حسب الأولوية. 4. **تكامل سلس**: يتكامل \\"Sales Hub\\" بسلاسة مع باقي منتجات HubSpot والأدوات الأخرى التي تستخدمها، لتوفير تجربة عمل سلسة ومتكاملة. 5. **تعاون في الوقت الفعلي**: عزز التنسيق بين فريق المبيعات والتسويق والدعم للوصول إلى أهدافك بسرعة أكبر. هل أنت جاهز لتحقيق أقصى استفادة من عملية المبيعات الخاصة بك والارتقاء بأداء فريقك إلى المستوى التالي؟ انضمّ إلى \\"Sales Hub\\" اليوم وشاهد نمو أعمالك يتسارع بوتيرة لم تشهدها من قبل! ✨ زر موقعنا الإلكتروني [إدراج رابط] للمزيد من المعلومات وابدأ رحلتك نحو تحقيق نتائج مبيعات استثنائية الآن! --- ملاحظة: يرجى التأكد من استبدال \\"[إدراج رابط]\\" برابط فعلي يؤدي إلى المزيد من المعلومات أو صفحة الهبوط الخاصة بـ\\"Sales Hub\\" عند استخدام هذا الإعلان."},{"prompt":"إنه طويل جدا","completion":"بالتأكيد، إليك نسخة مختصرة: --- 🚀 **صعّد مبيعاتك مع Sales Hub من HubSpot!** 🚀 ✅ **أتمتة المبيعات**: وداعاً للمهام المتكررة. ركز على بناء علاقات مع عملائك. ✅ **تحليلات عميقة**: قراراتك أصبحت أسهل مع بيانات دقيقة. ✅ **إدارة فعّالة للعملاء المحتملين**: حدد أولوياتك واستهدف بذكاء. ✅ **تكامل سلس**: جميع أدواتك المفضلة ومنتجات HubSpot في تناغم تام. ✅ **تعاون متقدم**: فريقك متصل ومنتج أكثر من أي وقت مضى. 💡 **هل أنت جاهز للارتقاء بمستوى فريق المبيعات؟** انضم الآن إلى Sales Hub وشاهد عملك ينمو! 🔗 [زر موقعنا الآن!](#) --- تأكد من إضافة الرابط الفعلي حيث يشير (زر موقعنا الآن!)."},{"prompt":"اريد أفضل من هدا يمكنني وضعه على Google ads","completion":"لإنشاء نص إعلان موجز وفعّال لاستخدامه في Google Ads يخص \\"Sales Hub\\" من HubSpot، من المهم التركيز على الرسائل القوية مع الحفاظ على الوضوح والإيجاز. إليك اقتراح: --- **عزز مبيعاتك مع HubSpot Sales Hub! ✨** - أسرع في إنهاء الصفقات. - أتمتة العمليات وتحليلات دقيقة. - حلول متكاملة لكل مرحلة مبيعات. **🚀 تحول إلى أداء أسرع وأذكى اليوم!** --- يجب التأكد من أن الاقتراح يلبي قواعد Google Ads من حيث الطول والمحتوى، وكذلك يجب استخدام الكلمات الرئيسية المناسبة التي تتوافق مع استراتيجية البحث المستهدفة لضمان أعلى معدلات الظهور والتفاعل."},{"prompt":"إعطني نص إعلاني ل sales hub مختصر","completion":"بالطبع، ها هو نص إعلاني مختصر لـ Sales Hub من HubSpot مناسب للاستخدام في السياقات التي تتطلب إيجازًا شديدًا، مثل Google Ads: --- 🚀 **ارفع أداء مبيعاتك مع Sales Hub!** ✅ **اتمتة سلسة** | ✅ **تحليلات دقيقة** | ✅ **نمو مضمون** 👉 **فاعلية لا مثيل لها لفريقك التجاري!** اكتشف المزيد! --- هذا الإعلان يركز على تقديم الوعود الرئيسية لمنتج Sales Hub بطريقة موجزة وجذابة، مما يجعله مثاليًا لبيئات الإعلان المحدودة بعدد الكلمات."},{"prompt":"كموسق بالعمولة ماوالمنتجات التي يمكنني الترويج لها اي Hubspot","completion":"كمسوق بالعمولة، HubSpot يوفر فرصًا متنوعة للترويج لمنتجاته، وذلك عبر برنامج HubSpot للشركاء التابعين.

The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid.

Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu].","completion":"**Chapter V: The Phoenix Ascendant: From Beiyang to Ming Dynasty Revival** The early decades of the twentieth century witnessed unprecedented changes in the fabric of Chinese society and governance. Following the National Protection War, the Empire of China, under the wary guidance of the Beiyang Government, embarked on a path that would decisively reshape its historical trajectory and reestablish its legendary dynastic rule. In the aftermath of Yuan Shikai's brief imperial experiment, the realm found itself at a crossroads. The sudden vacancy of the throne and the refusal of Yuan Keding to ascend as Emperor left the nation in a state of uncertainty. The conflict, although brief, had seen fierce loyalty towards the concept of a Chinese resurgence, unshackled from the infamy of recent humiliations. It was this fervent desire for renewal that led to the unthinkable - the invitation extended to the descendants of the Ming Dynasty by the National Assembly, under the emboldened Beiyang Government. The voluntary relinquishment of claims by Yuntai, combined with his strategic alignment with the Imperial House of Zhu through familial unions, heralded the dawn of a new epoch. This complex mosaic of political maneuvering, enshrined in the hope and aspirations of countless Chinese, mirrored the spirit of rebirth that characterized the Meiji Restoration in Japan. Just as Japan had reclaimed its sovereignty and embarked on a path to modernization and global prominence, so too did China envisage a future where it could stand as a beacon of progress, innovation, and traditional valor. The blueprint for this monumental transformation demanded a reevaluation of the foundational tenets of governance and social organization. The efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary monarchy drew inspiration from both the aspirations of the Xinhai Revolution and the pragmatic acknowledgment of the need for inclusive, modernized governance. This hybrid model sought to encapsulate Sun Yat-Sen's triadic principles while ensuring that the historical and cultural legacy of the Ming Dynasty imbued the emerging societal framework with a sense of continuity and identity. The military reforms under the auspices of the revived Ming Dynasty were both a symbolic and practical necessity. The reconstitution of the Beiyang Army into the Great Ming Army represented not only a return to traditional grandeur but also an acknowledgment of the indispensable role of modernized military capability in safeguarding national sovereignty. The assistance from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans in this endeavor highlighted the international dimension of China's resurgence, showcasing a world eager to witness, and participate in, the rise of a rejuvenated China. The ideological and political reconciliation within the country also marked a significant development. Figures like Wang Jingwei, embodying the unresolved aspirations of Sun Yat-Sen, found new purpose within the framework of the restored monarchy. The incorporation of the Three Principles into the governmental ethos signified a bridging of revolutionary zeal and monarchical stability, offering a compelling vision of harmonious progress underpinned by enduring values of nationalism, democracy, and social welfare. As this newly reformed Chinese state embarked on ambitious industrial, educational, and infrastructural projects, it did so with a keen awareness of the delicate balance between tradition and modernity. The restored Ming Dynasty, in its quest to navigate the complexities of the contemporary world, thus stood as a testament to the resilient spirit of the Chinese people – a phoenix arisen from the ashes of tumultuous centuries, ready to assert its place in the dawn of a new era."},{"prompt":"Algeria is a people's republic.","completion":"Yes, Algeria is formally known as the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. It operates as a unitary semi-presidential republic, where the President is the head of state, and there is also a Prime Minister who acts as the head of government. The political system is structured under a framework of a multi-party system, and the legislative power is vested both in the government and the two chambers of the parliament: the National People's Assembly and the Council of the Nation. The country's legal system is based on French and Islamic law. Since gaining independence from France in 1962, Algeria's political landscape has been dominated by military and civilian elites."},{"prompt":"Is Algeria a socialist state?","completion":"Algeria has a history of incorporating socialist principles into its governance and economic policies, especially in the years following its independence from France in 1962. The country’s first president, Ahmed Ben Bella, and his successor, Houari Boumediene, implemented a range of socialist policies including nationalizing key industries, agrarian reform, and promoting state-led development. However, describing Algeria as a socialist state in the traditional sense might not fully capture its current political and economic system. Over the years, especially from the late 1980s and early 1990s, Algeria has undertaken economic reforms that introduced liberalization measures and reduced the role of the state in the economy, moving towards a more mixed economy. These reforms were partly in response to a severe economic crisis and the need to diversify the economy away from its heavy reliance on hydrocarbons (oil and gas), which still play a significant role in the country's revenues. The government maintains a significant influence over the economy through ownership of key sectors, including energy, banking, and transportation. Thus, while socialist principles have influenced its development and some aspects of the state's role in the economy can still be seen as reflective of socialist ideals, it would be more accurate to categorize Algeria as having a mixed economy with both socialist and market-oriented elements. In political terms, the current constitution and political practice place Algeria as a republic with a multi-party system, rather than a state governed by a single socialist or communist party doctrine."},{"prompt":"Can you simplify your previous response and use layman terms?","completion":"Sure! After Algeria became independent from France in 1962, it adopted some ideas from socialism. This means the government controlled major parts of the economy, like oil and gas, and tried to make sure wealth was shared among its people. However, calling Algeria a \\"socialist state\\" like Cuba or the old Soviet Union wouldn't be quite right today. Over time, especially starting from the late 1980s, Algeria began to change its ways. It allowed more room for private businesses and lessened the government's tight grip on the economy, though it still controls the most important sectors. So, while Algeria was heavily influenced by socialist ideas in the past and the government still plays a big role in the economy, it has also opened up to more free-market practices. This mix means Algeria has both socialist characteristics and capitalist (market-oriented) elements in its economy and governance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They’re pulled into the gravitational field of an uncharted planet. Gloopy: “Whoa, the warp drive is acting up. We’re going in for an unexpected landing, Glitter!” Glitter: “Hang on, Gloopy! Let’s make this an opportunity to discover something new!” - The blob-mobile makes a bouncy touchdown onto the surface of a dusty, gray planet devoid of color and light. Scene 2: The Mysterious Terrain - Stepping out of their ship, Gloopy and Glitter look around at the stark landscape. Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks. - The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows. Gloopy: “This place could use some of our sparkly charm, don’t you think?” Glitter: “Definitely. It’s so… drab.” Scene 3: The Shadow Stir - As they traverse the dull terrain, seeking materials to repair the blob-mobile, Gloopy’s gooey footprints and Glitter’s sparkly trail are the only sources of brightness in this gloomy world. - Unexpectedly, the shadows cast by the dim star begin to move and swirl around their bright paths. It’s as if the shadows are alive, curious, and drawn to their light. Glitter (puzzlement shimmering in her eyes): “Do you see that, Gloopy?

Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!” Scene 4: The Connection - As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them. - This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication.

How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop.

Title: “Gloopy’s Shape Sensation” Scene 1: An Unexpected Audience - Our adventure begins with Gloopy and Glitter exploring the vast cosmos, powered by the warp drive they won from “The Great Space Entry” competition. Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts. Glitter: “Gloopy, I’ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes—circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture. Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation. Announcer: “Presenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!” - With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal.

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals!

User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse.

User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

Write a tweet saying GGR and G&G will intially be alongside this show, but later supersede it 📢 Heads up, #CW4Kids fans! 🎉 “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” initially will party alongside “Johnny Test,” but get ready for a stellar lineup change! 🌟 They’ll soon take center stage and supersede our test-tube brother.

(Clips continue) Announcer: It means you're gonna get even more of your favourite shows, more brand new adventures and more FUN, On January 6 this network's name will become the CW4Kids (Logo morphs again) There weren't any 4Kids shows in the promo, likely to ease the transition and make kids think it's the same block, just slowly changing Forum Thread Title: “Final Days of Kids’ WB - CW4Kids Name Change Looming” User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 10:45 AM Just caught the latest promo folks! December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings! Voiceover: Coming February 17th, prepare to thaw out your winter blues with the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history.

User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Late-Winter Lineup Change Incoming Feb. 17 – New Shows Alert!” User1: ToonTrendWatcher Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:15 AM Hey fellow CW4Kids enthusiasts! Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

It feels like only yesterday when we first heard the announcement, “On Jan 6, This kids network is changing its name to the CW4Kids.” Who could’ve predicted the wild ride this transition would be? Tonight’s Spring Lineup Preview Event hosted by Gloopy was the perfect capstone to this rollercoaster. It’s impressive to see how much has changed and what’s to come. What did everyone else think?

This transition’s been something else – from the initial announcement to the complete overhaul; it’s been a journey. User3: ClassicToonCritic Posted on April 12, 2024, at 6:45 PM Truly a rollercoaster of emotions throughout this transition. The preview event showcased all the hard work and planning that went into reimagining CW4Kids. Seeing “Code Lyoko” still making waves alongside new entries like “Pokemon Horizons” was heartwarming. And Gloopy definitely stole the show; such charisma! User4: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM The preview event just solidified my faith in CW4Kids’ direction. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and new beginnings. The gradual shift from what we knew and loved to what’s to come was handled so well. The sneak peeks at “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” suggest we’re in for some epic adventures. Can’t wait! User5: SaturdaySpectator Posted on April 12, 2024, at 7:30 PM Gloopy hosting was a true highlight – added that extra bit of charm and humor. And I agree, it’s been quite the transition; each step, from the initial promos to today’s preview event, was carefully curated to bring us along for the ride. The CW4Kids team deserves a huge round of applause for juggling the old and the new so seamlessly.

Write a blog post on March 6 about the shorts change, with the title being “Lamput and Planet Sketch are dead, long live” # Lamput and Planet Sketch are Dead, Long Live The Gees, Pikachu’s Jukebox, and GoGoWiki March 6, 2024 In the ever-evolving landscape of children’s television, change is the only constant. With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines. Yet, as we mourn their departure, we also welcome with open arms the new contenders set to fill the void: “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” provided us with laughter, creativity, and endless entertainment. “Lamput,” with its minimalistic yet expressive animation, gave us a silent but hilariously dynamic orange blob constantly escaping the clutches of dimwitted scientists. “Planet Sketch” took us on a rollercoaster of comedy with its diverse cast of characters and unpredictable scenarios.

This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening. While we reminisce about the creativity and laughter brought to us by “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” the arrival of “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki” marks a refreshing beginning with endless possibilities. CW4Kids continues to demonstrate its commitment to delivering diverse, quality content that captivates the imaginations of its young audience. in the process, ensuring that the legacy of Saturday morning cartoons not only endures but evolves. As we embrace this transition, it’s clear that while we may say “Lamput and Planet Sketch are dead,” the spirit of innovative, entertaining, and beloved shorts lives on through “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” Long live the new kings and queens of CW4Kids’ animated shorts!

Also, here's the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition! While we can’t reveal much just yet, rest assured that CW4Kids is dedicated to bringing you quality animation and exciting new shows. “Coming Soon” means new adventures are on the horizon, so stay tuned for more updates and thank you for sticking with us through this new chapter!

User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch!

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment.

Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings?

Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store. Thanks for being such dedicated viewers, and remember, new discoveries await every Saturday on CW4Kids! Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Preview Extravaganza Talkback - Embracing the New Era” User1: ToonVisionary Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:00 PM Just watched the CW4Kids Spring Preview Extravaganza, and wow, what a showcase! Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since “just after Christmas,” making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking? User2: DigitalDawn Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM The preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially “Pokemon Horizons” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,” has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who’ve been here through it all. User3: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM I appreciated the nod to the transition period—it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Chaotic” looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting! User4: RetroRewind Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM The whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza! Our aim was to celebrate both the journey we’ve embarked on since “just after Christmas” and the exciting path ahead. Every show, be it a returning favorite or a new addition, is a piece of the CW4Kids puzzle we’re carefully putting together for our audience.

Forum Thread Title: “4KidsTV Schedule Shake-Up: ‘GoGoRiki’ Gains More Ground & Farewell to ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’” User1: EternalToonFan Posted on April 21, 2024, at 9:45 AM Heads up! Starting next week, “GoGoRiki” is snagging an additional slot on the 4KidsTV channel, this time taking over “Shaman King” at 11 AM. With its growing popularity on CW4Kids, it seems “GoGoRiki” is set to become even more of a mainstay. But there’s more—“Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” are bidding us farewell come May 1st, replaced by two shows currently exclusive to CW4Kids. The winds of change are certainly blowing through 4KidsTV. Thoughts? User2: RetroAnimeWatcher Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:00 AM Wow, “GoGoRiki” really is taking over! Surprised to see “Shaman King” getting the boot, but “GoGoRiki” has been a hit, so it makes sense. As for “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” leaving, it’s a shame. “One Piece” especially has been a long-standing favorite. Curious to find out which CW4Kids shows will fill in their slots. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:15 AM It’s bittersweet seeing “Tomodachi Life” go; those Miis brought unique charm and humor. “One Piece” had its epic journey too. The removal didn’t come as a surprise, though, considering they stopped streaming on 4kids.tv early March. Now I’m intrigued about which CW4Kids shows will transition over to the 24/7 channel. Any guesses? User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:30 AM “I’ll miss the Miis” from “Tomodachi Life,” too. That show had such a quirky, fun vibe. Exciting to hear that “GoGoRiki” is expanding its presence, though! I’m betting “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and possibly “Code Lyoko” could be the ones to make the jump to 4KidsTV. Both have been stellar on CW4Kids and seem like natural fits to broaden their audience. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:45 AM The departure of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” surely marks the end of an era, but it’s also thrilling to see CW4Kids shows stepping up. “GoGoRiki” nabbing another slot is impressive. It kind of reflects 4KidsTV’s adaptation to viewer preferences. Eagerly awaiting the announcement of which CW4Kids shows will fill those vacancies come May. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:00 AM “GoGoRiki” really is on a roll! I understand the logistics behind the changes, especially with streaming limitations signaling “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” were on their way out. It’s a smart play to bring more CW4Kids content into the 4KidsTV fold – keeps the brand cohesive and capitalizes on what’s working. Can’t wait to see what’s next! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:15 AM We appreciate all your feedback and understanding regarding the recent schedule changes at 4KidsTV. “GoGoRiki’s” additional timeslot is a testament to its success, and while we say goodbye to “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece,” we’re excited about bringing more of the CW4Kids experience to our 24/7 channel. Stay tuned for the official announcement on the CW4Kids shows transitioning over in May.

Forum Thread Title: “Unexpected Logo & Credits Swap During ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’ Airings – April 19th” User1: ToonTalkerTerry Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:00 PM Did anyone else catch the odd change-up at the end of today’s “Tomodachi Life” episode on 4KidsTV? Instead of the usual Nintendo, TV Asahi, and Gallop logos during the Split Screen Credits, we got an S4C and Inovism logo. Even the copyright tag was swapped to show a different show title, though the credits were still for TL. Then, the same thing happened with “One Piece” at 7pm – the Toei logo was replaced with Animation Studio Petersburg! Looks like the logo and copyright tags changed over early? What’s going on? User2: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:15 PM Wow, I thought I was seeing things! That was definitely not the usual ending credit scene for either show. Maybe they’re gearing up for the replacements coming in May but jumped the gun on changing the visuals? It does seem like a mix-up in preparing for the transition of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” out of the lineup. User3: RetroRewind Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:30 PM This feels like a big oops moment on someone’s part. Showing S4C and Inovism logos during “Tomodachi Life” and then Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” is quite the premature switch. They must be setting the stage for whatever’s taking their slots, but someone got a bit too eager with updating the credits! User4: FutureToonFan Posted on April 19, 2024, at 8:45 PM It’s a peculiar error for sure, but kind of exciting if you think about it. It hints at the direction 4KidsTV is taking after “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” say their farewells. Swapping the logos early must’ve been a mistake, but it gives us a glimpse into what’s coming. Animation Studio Petersburg and S4C/Inovism involvement sounds promising for the new content! User5: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:00 PM Certainly, an unexpected sneak peek into the future! Mixing up the credits does spoil the surprise a bit, but I’m intrigued by what S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg will bring to the table. This mishap aside, it seems like 4KidsTV is prepping for a refreshed lineup with some serious creative power behind it. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:15 PM Mistakes happen, but this one is pretty telling. It’s like getting an accidental peek at your birthday presents. S4C and Inovism on “Tomodachi Life” and Animation Studio Petersburg for “One Piece” – definitely interesting choices for partners. Curious to see how this early logo swap hints at the quality and direction of their replacements! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:30 PM Apologies for the confusion during today’s airings of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece.” The updated logos and copyright tags were indeed a bit premature as we prepare for the exciting new shows set to debut in their slots in May. We appreciate your understanding and eagerness as we transition to fresh content with our partners S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg. Stay tuned for official announcements and more surprises on the way! Thanks for being such dedicated viewers!

Thoughts on these swaps? User2: RetroGamer Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I’m going to miss the quirky stories of “Tomodachi Life.” The island’s always been a bit of a virtual getaway for me. Swapping it with “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is intriguing, though. Alien slimes could bring a whole new dimension of comedy we haven’t seen before on the network. User3: PirateFan101 Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:15 AM As much as I love “One Piece,” its ratings have been trailing behind “Pokémon” for the last 6 months. It seems like a strategic move by 4KidsTV to refresh their lineup with shows that have the potential to attract a broader audience. “GoGoRiki” does have its charm, and it’ll be interesting to see how it fills the action-packed void left by our beloved pirates. User4: ToonAnalyst Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:30 AM To shed a bit more light on why “Tomodachi Life” is leaving, it primarily comes down to Nintendo moving away from 3DS support. The show, being based on a game for a platform that’s no longer actively supported, makes it a bit outdated for 4KidsTV’s dynamic and evolving lineup. As for “One Piece,” it’s really about the numbers. “Pokémon” has consistently outperformed it in ratings, making it a challenging environment for our pirate crew. In the entertainment business, especially in children’s programming, staying relevant and competitive is key. User5: NewEraNick Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:45 AM It’s sad to see two such unique shows go, but change is part of the TV landscape. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” sound like they’ll bring a lot of fresh energy and humor to the channel. Plus, considering the evolving interests of the audience, it seems like a natural progression. Here’s hoping they capture our imagination just as much! User6: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM Farewell to the Miis and pirates. While “Tomodachi Life” offered an unparalleled slice-of-life experience and “One Piece” took us on countless high seas adventures, it’s exciting to think about the new narratives and laughter “Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” will bring. The realm of children’s animation is all about evolution and innovation. Let’s embrace the change! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:15 AM We appreciate your thoughts and feelings on the transition from “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” to “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki.” Our goal at 4KidsTV is always to deliver engaging, diverse, and high-quality content that resonates with our viewers. Rest assured, these changes are made with a lot of thought and consideration for our audience’s evolving interests. We’re excited for you to join us on this new journey and thank you for your continuous support! Stay tuned for more adventures coming your way!

With all the recent changes on CW4Kids, especially the switch to the tech-themed presentation, I can't help but wonder if 4KidsTV will follow suit. The current red ball flying look has been iconic for years, but it seems like the computer theme on CW4Kids has really resonated with viewers. Do you think a similar rebrand is on the horizon for 4KidsTV? User2: AnimationInsider Posted on August 4, 2024, at 9:30 AM That's an interesting thought, PixelPundit! Given how well the computer theme has been received on CW4Kids, it wouldn’t surprise me if 4KidsTV considered a refresh. Aligning the branding across both platforms might create a more cohesive viewer experience. It’s all about staying relevant and appealing to the modern audience, after all. User3: RetroToonFan Posted on August 4, 2024, at 10:00 AM I've been thinking about this too. The tech vibe on CW4Kids has given the lineup a fresh and exciting edge. If 4KidsTV were to undergo a similar rebrand, it could breathe new life into the channel. However, there’s a certain nostalgia attached to the current design, so it's a delicate balance to strike. User4: DigitalDreamer Posted on August 4, 2024, at 10:45 AM As much as I love the nostalgia of the current 4KidsTV aesthetics, evolution is key in the media landscape. A rebrand aligning with CW4Kids could potentially attract a newer, younger audience while maintaining the core fanbase with updated content. Still, it's all speculative until there's an official word. User5: SaturdayMorningSavvy Posted on August 4, 2024, at 11:15 AM It's a smart idea to unify the branding between CW4Kids and 4KidsTV. The computer theme symbolizes a step into the future and embraces the digital age we're living in. Plus, it could open more creative avenues for show intros, promos, and other content. I'm all for a rebrand if it's done thoughtfully! User6: ToonTechie Posted on August 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM While I'm intrigued by the notion of a cohesive brand image across CW4Kids and 4KidsTV, there's something to be said about each having its unique identity. The tech theme works wonderfully for CW4Kids, but 4KidsTV might benefit from something that complements rather than mirrors. Either way, any rebrand should honor the rich history of the channel. 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on August 4, 2024, at 12:30 PM Great discussions, everyone! We're always evaluating our brand to ensure it meets the expectations and tastes of our audience while staying true to our roots. While there are no immediate plans for a full rebrand of 4KidsTV announced, staying tuned and providing feedback like this is invaluable as we plot the future course of the channel.

理解 AppArmor 策略语言， - 编写针对你应用的策略， - 并确保它们在 LXC 容器和 Podman 容器间正确应用。 这可能会比较复杂，因为需要对 AppArmor 和你的应用行为有深入的理解。 3. **透传 AppArmor 策略**: 在某些情况下，你可能可以直接在特权 LXC 容器的配置中，指定 AppArmor 策略，这样运行在 LXC 容器内的 Podman 容器也会被这些策略覆盖。 请注意，这将取决于你的具体设置和 LXC 版本。LXC 配置文件通常位于 \`/var/lib/lxc/[容器名称]/config\` 或类似路径下。在这个文件中，你可能会需要设置类似于以下的条目： \`\`\`plaintext lxc.apparmor.profile = your-custom-profile \`\`\` 这里，\`your-custom-profile\` 应该是你创建并通过 AppArmor 加载的策略名称。这种方法需要你对 LXC 和 AppArmor 都有相当的了解。 4. **咨询相关文档和社区**: 给定在特权 LXC 容器中运行 Podman 并涉及到 AppArmor 策略可能的复杂性，强烈建议仔细阅读 LXC、Podman 以及 AppArmor 的相关文档。此外，相关的社区论坛、邮件列表和即时通讯群组可以是获取帮助的好地方。 请记住，操作特权容器和调整 AppArmor 策略都需要较高的权限和对系统安全模型的理解。在进行这些操作时，请始终考虑到安全影响。如果可能，尽量避免在特权容器内运行 Podman 或 Docker，因为这种做法会增加安全风险。"},{"prompt":"lxc.apparmor.profile应该如何配置？","completion":"针对 \`lxc.apparmor.profile\` 的配置需要理解 AppArmor 和 LXC 的交互方式。AppArmor 是一个基于 Linux 内核的强制访问控制系统，用于限制程序的能力，而 LXC（Linux 容器）则利用 AppArmor 来增强容器的安全性。针对的是 LXC 容器配置，\`lxc.apparmor.profile\` 是在 LXC 容器的配置文件中用来指定 AppArmor 安全策略的参数。 1. **如何配置 \`lxc.apparmor.profile\`** 在 LXC 容器的配置文件中，通常位于 \`/var/lib/lxc/容器名称/config\`（对于较新的 LXC 版本，也可能位于 \`/etc/lxc/default.conf\` 或特定用户的 \`~/.config/lxc/default.conf\`），你可以设置 \`lxc.apparmor.profile\` 指向一个特定的 AppArmor 策略文件。例如： \`\`\`plaintext lxc.apparmor.profile = generated \`\`\` 这个设置指示 LXC 对每个容器使用一个自动生成的 AppArmor 策略。这是默认设置，适用于大多数情况，为容器提供了基线的安全保护。 如果要使用一个自定义的 AppArmor 策略，可以按如下方式配置： \`\`\`plaintext lxc.apparmor.profile = /path/to/your/custom/profile \`\`\` 注意，路径要替换为实际的 AppArmor 策略文件路径。但是，实际上在 LXC 配置中通常不直接引用磁盘上的文件路径，而是引用 AppArmor 策略的名称，该策略应该已经通过 \`apparmor_parser\` 加载到 AppArmor 系统中。例如： \`\`\`plaintext lxc.apparmor.profile = your-custom-profile \`\`\` 2. **默认策略与自定义策略** - **默认策略**：\`generated\` （或 \`lxc-container-default\` 和 \`lxc-container-default-cgns\` 等，根据 LXC 版本和配置可能稍有不同）是 LXC 为容器提供默认的 AppArmor 策略集，旨在平衡安全性与功能性。 - **自定义策略**：如果默认策略不符合你的特定需求，可以创建自定义 AppArmor 策略。创建自定义策略通常涉及到编写一个 AppArmor 策略文件，然后使用 \`apparmor_parser -a your_custom_policy\` 命令加载这个策略。之后，你就可以在 LXC 配置中通过 \`lxc.apparmor.profile = your-custom-policy-name\` 引用它。 3. **安全注意事项** 在创建和应用自定义 AppArmor 策略时，需要仔细考虑所授予容器的权限。过于宽松的策略可能会降低容器隔离的有效性，而过于严格的策略则可能阻止容器正常运行。建议从默认策略出发，根据需要逐步调整并测试自定义策略。 由于直接编辑 AppArmor 策略和 LXC 容器配置涉及到系统安全设置，因此建议在对 AppArmor 和 LXC 有深入了解的情况下进行，或在测试环境中尝试，确保不会对生产环境造成影响。"},{"prompt":"lxc.apparmor.profile = generated放在哪里？","completion":"\`lxc.apparmor.profile\` 配置应该设置在 LXC 容器的配置文件中。LXC 容器的配置文件通常位于以下一些地方： 1. **单个容器的配置文件**: - 对于单个容器，其配置文件通常位于 \`/var/lib/lxc/<容器名称>/config\`。这是每个容器专有的配置文件，对该容器进行个性化设置。 例如，要为名为 \`mycontainer\` 的容器设置 \`lxc.apparmor.profile\`，你需要编辑 \`/var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/config\` 文件，并添加或修改以下行： \`\`\`plaintext lxc.apparmor.profile = generated \`\`\` 2. **全局或默认的 LXC 配置**: - 对于新创建的容器，你可能想要修改默认配置模板，这样所有新容器在创建时都会使用这个配置。默认的配置模板文件的位置可能会根据安装和 Linux 发行版的不同而有所变化，常见的路径包括： - \`/etc/lxc/default.conf\` - 用户专有的配置可能位于 \`~/.config/lxc/default.conf\` 或者 \`~/.lxc/default.conf\` 在任一上述文件中添加或修改 \`lxc.apparmor.profile = generated\` 行，将指示 LXC 使用默认（或“生成的”）AppArmor 策略来管理容器的安全性。这通常是一个平衡性能和安全性的好选择，但具体取决于你的安全需求和策略。 **重要提示**: - 在编辑任何配置文件之前，建议备份原有配置，以防止意外损坏或配置错误导致的问题。 - 修改配置文件后，对于正在运行的容器，通常需要重启容器以应用新的配置。 - 保证你对任何修改都有清晰的理解，尤其是涉及安全性设置（如 AppArmor 策略）时，错误的配置可能会降低系统的安全性或影响容器的正常运行。 如果你对 AppArmor 不熟悉，\`generated\` 表示 LXC 将为容器自动创建并应用一个通用的 AppArmor 策略。这通常足以提供基本的安全性，而不需要手动干预。不过，高级用户可能希望根据特定需求创建和指定自定义策略。"},{"prompt":"Which of the following is the most specific marker for alcoholism? A) ALT [22%] • B) GGT [59%] C) ALP [11%] * D) LDH [8%] 59% got this answer correct 5c5520decef591444288966 #AIIMS GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transferase) is the most specific marker of alcoholism among the given options. The markers with >60% sensitivity and specificity for heavy alcohol use are gamma-glutamy! transferase (>35 u) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), the combination of the two is likely to be more accurate than one. An isolated elevation in serum GGT or GGT elevation out of proportion to that of other enzymes (such as the ALT and ALP) may be an indicator of alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease. ALT (option A) is usually elevated in acute hepatocellular conditions such as hepatitis. Alanine aminotransferase is predominantly found in the liver, hence a more specific marker of liver injury. A ratio of AST/ALT > 2:1 indicates the possibility of alcoholic liver disease and > 3:1 ratio is highly indicative of this condition. In alcoholic liver disease, ALT levels are often normal. ALP (option C) is elevated in cholestasis, is also elevated when there is rapid bone growth like in children and adolescents because of bone alkaline phosphatase and in normal pregnancies due to placental alkaline phosphatase. LDH (option D) elevation is nonspecific. Bro pls explain this properly with missing points","completion":"Certainly! When assessing for alcoholism or the impact of chronic alcohol use on the liver, various biomarkers can be evaluated through routine blood tests. These biomarkers can help indicate liver dysfunction or damage, but their specificity and sensitivity to alcohol abuse can greatly vary. Here’s a more detailed explanation of the given options and why GGT is considered the most specific marker for alcoholism among them: # GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transferase) - **Specificity for Alcoholism**: GGT is an enzyme found in many organs throughout the body, but primarily in the liver. An elevated level of GGT is particularly seen in cases of heavy alcohol use, making it one of the most sensitive and specific tests for detecting chronic alcohol consumption. It’s worth noting, however, that GGT can also be elevated in other liver diseases and due to medications that induce hepatic enzymes. Nonetheless, in the context of other clinical findings, a significantly elevated GGT in comparison to other liver function tests can strongly suggest alcohol abuse. - **Mechanism**: Chronic alcohol consumption induces the expression of GGT. An isolated increase in GGT or a level that is disproportionately high compared to other liver enzymes can hint at alcohol-related liver disease, though it's not exclusively diagnostic of this condition. # ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) - **Specificity for Alcoholism**: ALT is an enzyme primarily found in the liver. Its elevation generally indicates liver injury or inflammation, rather than directly pointing to alcohol abuse. ALT levels can increase due to a wide range of liver conditions, including viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury. Thus, ALT is less specific for alcoholism. - **Comparison with AST**: In the context of alcohol misuse, the AST to ALT ratio becomes relevant. An AST/ALT ratio greater than 2:1 can suggest alcoholic liver disease, especially when seen in conjunction with elevated GGT levels. # ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) - **Specificity for Alcoholism**: ALP is also less specific to alcohol abuse, as it can be elevated in conditions causing cholestasis (blockage of bile flow), bone disease, and during normal pregnancy. Elevated ALP levels can indicate liver or bone pathology but do not specifically signal alcohol-related liver damage. # LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) - **Specificity for Alcoholism**: LDH is an enzyme present in almost all body tissues. Its elevation is a nonspecific marker of tissue damage and can occur in a wide range of conditions, including liver disease, but it is not specific for alcoholism or liver disease due to alcohol. # Conclusion Therefore, of the options provided, GGT stands out as the most specific marker for chronic alcohol use or abuse due to its inducible nature in the liver by alcohol. However, no single test can definitively diagnose alcoholism; a combination of clinical findings, patient history, and multiple test results should be considered for an accurate assessment. Also noteworthy is carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), another marker with high specificity for chronic alcohol consumption, although it was not an option in the list provided."},{"prompt":"Can u write organised points to point way so I have easy to read this faster for my exam revisions and remember faster","completion":"Absolutely! Here's a more structured and bullet-pointed summary for quick revision and easy memory retention: # GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transferase) - **Specificity**: High for alcoholism. - **Reason**: Elevates due to chronic alcohol use; however, can also increase in other liver diseases and with certain medications. - **Clinical Note**: An isolated increase or disproportionate elevation relative to other liver enzymes points towards alcohol use. # ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) - **Specificity**: Low for alcoholism. - **Reason**: Indicates liver injury or inflammation but not specific to alcohol. Increases in various liver conditions. - **Clinical Note**: AST/ALT ratio > 2:1 is indicative of alcoholic liver disease. # ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) - **Specificity**: Low for alcoholism. - **Reason**: Elevates in cholestasis, bone diseases, and pregnancy; not specific to alcohol-related liver damage. # LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) - **Specificity**: Very low for alcoholism. - **Reason**: Elevates non-specifically in tissue damage across various conditions, including but not limited to liver disease. # Additional Points for Quick Revision: - **Best Indicator**: Among the options, GGT is the best indicator of chronic alcohol abuse or alcoholism. - **AST/ALT Ratio**: AST/ALT > 2:1 ratio suggests alcoholic liver disease, specifically when compared in conjunction with GGT levels. - **Comprehensive Assessment**: Diagnosis of alcoholism or its impact on the liver involves a combination of tests (including GGT and AST/ALT ratio), patient history, and clinical examination. - **Other Marker Not Listed**: Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) - Highly specific for chronic alcohol consumption but not provided in the initial options. Remember, no single test is definitive for diagnosing alcoholism; a holistic approach based on multiple factors is essential."},{"prompt":"Test Category Serum measurement Cytosolic hepatocellular enzymes Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) Hepatocyte integrity Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Substances normally secreted in bile Serum bilirubin • Total: unconjugated plus conjugated • Direct: conjugated only Urine bilirubin Biliary excretory function Serum bile acids Plasma membrane enzymes (from damage to bile canaliculus) Serum alkaline phosphatase Serum v-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) Proteins secreted into the blood Serum albumin Coagulation factors: Hepatocyte synthetic function Prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (fibrinogen, prothrombin, factors V, VII, IX, and X) Hepatocyte metabolism Serum ammonia Aminopyrine breath test (hepatic demethylation) Explain this test bro it's segnificance in various dissese","completion":"The Aminopyrine Breath Test (ABT) is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate liver function, specifically focusing on the liver's ability to demethylate a given substrate, in this case, aminopyrine, a drug metabolized by the liver. Here’s a detailed explanation of this test and its significance: # Overview of the Aminopyrine Breath Test: - **Method**: The test involves the patient ingesting a dose of ^14C or ^13C-labeled aminopyrine (a synthetic compound). The liver metabolizes aminopyrine, and one of the metabolic pathways involves demethylation. This process releases the labeled carbon (^14C or ^13C) as carbon dioxide (CO2), which is then exhaled in the breath. - **Measurement**: The amount of labeled CO2 in the breath is measured over a specific timeframe, typically several hours post-ingestion. The rate at which the labeled CO2 appears in the breath is an indicator of the demethylating capacity of the liver. # Significance in Various Diseases: - **Liver Function Assessment**: The test is primarily used to assess the liver's metabolic capacity. A reduction in the metabolizing capacity can indicate liver dysfunction. - **Liver Diseases**: It's particularly valuable in diagnosing and monitoring various liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and fatty liver disease. These conditions can impair the liver's ability to metabolize drugs and other substances, reflected in the test results. - **Detection of Liver Damage**: In chronic liver diseases, the liver's metabolic functions are compromised. The ABT can detect early changes in liver function before more apparent signs and symptoms of liver disease become evident. - **Monitoring Liver Health**: In addition to diagnosing liver conditions, the ABT can be used to monitor the progression of liver disease or the recovery of liver function following treatment. # Advantages: - **Non-Invasive**: Compared to liver biopsies, the ABT is non-invasive and poses minimal risk to the patient. - **Quantitative**: Provides quantitative data on liver function that can be tracked over time. # Limitations: - **Sensitivity**: While useful, the test may not detect all forms of liver dysfunction, especially in cases of mild impairment. - **Availability and Use**: The use of radioactive isotopes (^14C) has made the test less popular in some regions due to regulatory, safety, and disposal concerns. However, tests using stable isotopes (^13C) have mitigated some of these issues. In summary, the Aminopyrine Breath Test offers a valuable method for assessing the functional capacity of the liver, especially its demethylation activity. It's used to diagnose, evaluate the severity, and monitor the progression or improvement of liver diseases. Despite its benefits, the test's application can be limited by its sensitivity and the logistics of using isotopes, making it one of several tools in comprehensive liver function assessment."},{"prompt":"Dump it's not only test read properly what I had send u","completion":"I apologize for any misunderstanding in my previous response. Let’s address the broader spectrum of liver function tests you mentioned to ensure a comprehensive overview: # Serum Measurement Tests for Liver Function: **1. Cytosolic Hepatocellular Enzymes:** - **Serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST):** Indicates hepatocyte integrity. Elevated in liver damage but not liver-specific, as it is also found in cardiac muscle, kidneys, brain, and skeletal muscle. - **Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT):** More specific to the liver than AST and indicates hepatocyte injury. A higher level suggests liver inflammation or damage. - **Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Less specific for liver damage and can be elevated in a variety of tissues upon injury. **2. Substances Normally Secreted in Bile:** - **Serum Bilirubin** (Total: unconjugated plus conjugated, Direct: conjugated only) signifies liver’s ability to take up, process, and excrete bilirubin. Elevated levels indicate liver dysfunction or bile duct obstruction. - **Urine Bilirubin:** Appearance in urine indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting liver’s failure to excrete it into bile or bile duct obstruction. - **Serum Bile Acids:** Increase in serum bile acids indicates impaired liver function or bile flow obstruction. **3. Plasma Membrane Enzymes (from damage to bile canaliculus):** - **Serum Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):** Elevation indicates cholestasis or bone disease. It’s important in diagnosing bile duct obstruction. - **Serum Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT):** Elevates in similar conditions as ALP, and its specificity for liver comes when assessing for alcohol abuse or cholestatic diseases. **4. Proteins Secreted into the Blood:** - **Serum Albumin:** Indicates liver’s synthetic function. Decreased levels can suggest chronic liver disease or malnutrition. - **Coagulation Factors:** Prothrombin Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) assessment can indicate liver’s ability to synthesize clotting factors (dependent on Vitamin K), reflecting liver function. **5. Hepatocyte Metabolism:** - **Serum Ammonia:** Elevated levels can indicate severe liver dysfunction, as the liver is unable to convert ammonia to urea properly. # Aminopyrine Breath Test (Hepatic Demethylation Activity): - **Purpose:** This test was mentioned as part of hepatocyte metabolism assessment, focusing on the liver’s ability to demethylate drugs. It encapsulates the liver's metabolic functions by measuring the demethylation of aminopyrine. - **Significance:** The test serves as an indicator of hepatic enzyme activity, especially relevant in evaluating the liver’s drug metabolizing capacity which can be affected in various liver diseases. # Incorporating Comprehensive Overview: Each category of tests provides unique insights into different aspects of liver function, from enzyme levels indicating cell damage to substances indicating bile flow obstruction, synthetic function, and metabolic capacity. When evaluated together, these tests give a comprehensive picture of liver health, aiding in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of liver diseases.

Test cricket and Twenty20 (T-20) cricket are two of the most popular formats, offering distinctly different experiences for both players and fans. Here is a more detailed comparison between Test and T-20 cricket: # Game Duration - **Test Cricket:** Matches are played over five days, with each playing day typically consisting of three sessions of two hours each, making it the longest format of cricket. - **T-20 Cricket:** Matches are much shorter, generally completed in about three hours, similar in duration to other major team sports. # Overs and Innings - **Test Cricket:** Unlimited overs within the five-day duration, with each team having two innings. The aim is to score as many runs as possible before the team is all out or the captain decides to declare the innings closed. - **T-20 Cricket:** Each team faces a maximum of 20 overs in a single innings. The game is thus highly condensed and encourages aggressive batting. # Strategies and Pace - **Test Cricket:** The format allows for a wide range of strategies, including carefully paced batting to build a large total and planned bowling to outlast the opposition. It's as much a mental game as it is about physical endurance and skill. - **T-20 Cricket:** Prioritizes quick scoring and often leads to aggressive batting techniques. Bowling and fielding strategies are focused on containing runs and taking quick wickets to pressure the batting side. # Player Roles - **Test Cricket:** There is more room for specialists, such as a batsman who can bat for long durations or a bowler who can bowl long spells. All-rounders are valuable but not at the expense of having a weakness in either batting or bowling. - **T-20 Cricket:** Demands players to be versatile. Batsmen are expected to score rapidly, and bowlers are tasked with being economical as well as taking wickets. All-rounders, capable of contributing in both departments, are particularly valuable. # Match Outcome - **Test Cricket:** Besides win or loss, matches can also end in a draw if the time expires without all innings being completed, or a tie if both teams' scores are equal and all innings have been played. - **T-20 Cricket:** Ties are resolved with a Super Over, where each team bowls one additional over. Draws are not possible because the match concludes in a single day. # Impact on Players and Fans - **Test Cricket:** Offers a comprehensive examination of players' skills and mental toughness. It's often seen as the pinnacle of cricket, enjoying a traditionalist fan base. The slow build-up of the game allows for nuanced storytelling and deep engagement with the match's ebb and flow. - **T-20 Cricket:** Has significantly broadened cricket's appeal globally, attracting younger audiences and those new to the game with its fast pace and entertainment value. It has also introduced new commercial opportunities through leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL). Each format offers a distinct flavor of cricket, with Test matches celebrating the game's rich history and finesse, while T-20 brings high-octane excitement and wider appeal."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

However, if every segment of your display lights up irrespective of the logic in your code, here are a few potential issues to investigate: # 1. Hardware Connections - **Correct Wiring:** Double-check your wiring between the MAX7219 and the microcontroller. Ensure that the DIN, CLK, and CS of the MAX7219 are correctly connected to the respective SPI pins of the STM32. - **Power Supply:** Ensure the MAX7219 receives a stable 5V power supply, and verify the ground (GND) connection is shared between the MAX7219 and the STM32. # 2. SPI Communication - **Compatibility:** Confirm that the SPI settings (clock polarity (CPOL), clock phase (CPHA), and maximum clock frequency) are compatible with MAX7219 requirements. For the MAX7219, \`SPI_MODE0\` (which you're using) is typically correct, with CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 0. - **Clock Speed:** Sometimes, running the SPI clock too fast can cause issues. You've set \`SPI.setClockDivider(SPI_CLOCK_DIV32);\`, which may or may not be appropriate depending on your system clock. Ensure this setting yields a SPI clock frequency that the MAX7219 can handle reliably (The MAX7219 datasheet specifies a maximum clock frequency of 10MHz). # 3. Software Issues - **SPI Configuration:** Since you're using an STM32 microcontroller, double-check that the SPI library and functions you're using are compatible. The Arduino framework for STM32 might have differences compared to standard Arduino boards (like those based on AVR microcontrollers). - **Pin Definitions:** Make sure the pin definitions (\`CS\` and \`UserButton_state\`) match your physical setup. Especially since you're defining \`CS\` as \`D10\`, ensure this corresponds correctly to the actual pin you're using on the STM32. Sometimes, pin mapping can lead to confusion when transitioning between Arduino and STM32 environments. # 4. MAX7219 Initialization Your \`Init_MAX7219\` function looks correct. It initializes the device with no decode mode for all digits, a medium brightness level, and enables all digits without entering the display test mode. If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you might want to: - **Confirm Initial Communication:** Try only sending a command to adjust brightness or to enable just one digit initially. This will help isolate if the issue is with data/command transmission. - **Display Test:** Temporarily enable the display test mode (\`send_data(0x0F, 0x01);\`) right after initialization to check if the display itself functions correctly in this built-in mode. Don't forget to turn it off afterwards. # 5. Library Usage - **Alternative Libraries:** While it's great to work directly with SPI for educational purposes, consider using a library dedicated to the MAX7219 for more complex projects, which might abstract away some of these low-level details and solve the issue implicitly. # Conclusion If after going through these checks your problem persists, focus on simplifying your setup to the bare minimum and verifying each component independently. Additionally, ensure that your STM32 environment and libraries are correctly set up for SPI communication, as differences from the standard Arduino environment can sometimes lead to subtle bugs."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Pour un étudiant qui va travailler à Montreuil ainsi qu’aux alentours de l’Arc de Triomphe, il serait idéal de privilégier des quartiers bien desservis par les transports en commun pour faciliter les déplacements entre ces deux zones. Voici quelques suggestions : 1. **République / Oberkampf** : Situé à une distance modérée tant de Montreuil que de l'Arc de Triomphe, ce quartier est dynamique, regorgeant de bars, restaurants, et espaces culturels. Bien desservi par plusieurs lignes de métro, il offre une bonne connexion vers les deux destinations. 2. **Bastille** : Ce quartier est un autre bon choix pour sa vie nocturne et sa proximité avec Montreuil. La ligne 1 du métro permet également de se rendre facilement à l’Arc de Triomphe, malgré une distance un peu plus conséquente. 3. **Le Marais** : Bien qu'un peu plus cher, ce quartier central et historique est bien connecté à de nombreuses lignes de métro et offre un cadre de vie agréable avec ses nombreuses boutiques, son architecture et ses espaces verts. 4. **Nation** : Directement connecté à Montreuil par la ligne 9 et relativement proche de l'Arc de Triomphe via les lignes 1 et 6, Nation est un carrefour important qui permet une bonne mobilité dans Paris. Les loyers peuvent y être plus abordables comparativement à des quartiers plus centraux. 5. **Charonne / Belleville** : Ces quartiers, un peu plus au nord, offrent souvent des loyers plus accessibles tout en restant connectés aux lieux de travail mentionnés. Belleville est particulièrement connu pour sa diversité culturelle et sa vie de quartier. Pour un étudiant, il est aussi pertinent d'envisager la colocation, très répandue à Paris, ce qui permet de réduire les coûts tout en vivant dans des quartiers plus centraux ou plus attractifs. N'oubliez pas d'utiliser des sites fiables pour votre recherche de logement, telles que les plateformes spécialisées pour les étudiants, ou des groupes dédiés sur les réseaux sociaux qui peuvent également offrir de bonnes opportunités de dernière minute. Enfin, gardez à l'esprit que le marché de l’immobilier à Paris est très compétitif ; il est donc conseillé de commencer vos recherches bien à l'avance et d’être réactif."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is an experimental tool to enable any of (at least any of the European) languages to be written precisely as they sound. The script is designed to be uniform, compact, logically substantiated and graphically attractive. The writing system is similar to the J.R.R. Tolkien's Tengwar script in Sindarin mode. It is written left to right in horizontal lines, and vowels are indicated with diacritics located above the consonant which follows them. Words are separated with spaces, and six more signs used in addition to four punctuation marks are full stop, hyphen, colon, semicolon, apostrophe and a dot placed below the letter marking it is a capital one. Numbers 0 to 9 are represented as simple set of dots.","completion":"Given the fascinating details about the language of Õlk̍ev̇, it appears that we are dealing with a highly innovative and complex constructed language (conlang). The conlang of Õlk̍ev̇ is a unique linguistic creation, incorporating elements from the Earthly concept of constructed languages, such as Esperanto, and blending these with a fictional extraterrestrial origin. The structure of Õlk̍ev̇, as outlined, showcases a blend of familiar linguistic constructs with imaginative elements associated with its alien creators. Here is a detailed breakdown based on the information provided: 1. **Script and Alphabetical Structure**: The alphabet of Õlk̍ev̇, with its 160 letters and 16 diacritics, is significantly more complex than most Earth-based languages. The division of letters into three categories (10 begins, 3 middles, 3 ends) is a unique feature, reminiscent of certain human scripts that adapt letter shapes depending on their position within a word, but taken to a much greater extent. 2. **Pronunciation and Numerical Values**: The decision to derive pronunciation and numerical values from the Braille alphabets is an innovative approach, integrating a tactile form of communication into a spoken and written language. This could suggest a highly inclusive linguistic system, designed with accessibility in mind. 3. **Grammar and Suffixes**: The grammar, taking cues from Esperanto with a simplified and regularized structure, aims for ease of learning and universality. The suffix system for determining parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and plurals) shows a logical structure that could facilitate language acquisition. 4. **Univar Alphabet Reference**: The mention of the Univar alphabet as developed by Igor Voloshin highlights an Earth-based attempt to create a universal phonetic script. Drawing parallels between Õlk̍ev̇’s script and Univar underscores the conlang’s foundation in phonetic precision and aesthetic design, aiming for a script that can accurately represent the sounds of the language. 5. **Comparison to Tengwar**: The reference to Tolkien’s Tengwar script situates Õlk̍ev̇ within a tradition of inventive linguistic creation that combines artistic design with functional communication. Like Tengwar, Õlk̍ev̇’s script appears to strive for beauty as well as utility, with a specific notation system for vowels and a clear arrangement for reading and writing. In conclusion, the language of Õlk̍ev̇ presents a rich and intricate linguistic system that combines aesthetic considerations with functional ones. Its creation reflects both an homage to and an expansion upon existing traditions of language construction, with unique innovations that suggest a complex cultural and perhaps technological backstory for its alien creators. The detailed structure of its script, grammar, and phonetics showcases a deep engagement with the challenges and possibilities of language design, making Õlk̍ev̇ a fascinating subject for further exploration in the realm of conlangs."},{"prompt":"Õlk̍ṅ is Earth-like planet orbit around gaseous planet Lṫeko̍y, home to single advanced civilization in mysterious violet spiral galaxy. It has carbon-based lifeform. Plant is violet due to uses bacteriorhodopsin alternative to chlorophyll. Planet is made of silicate, iron, asolate, titanium. Planet is most envied by other extraterrestrial civilizations, it has extreme abundance of other elements from neutron star. Atmosphere is composed nitrogen, oxygen, asole dioxide, trace neon. Atmosphere is lavender-colored due to presence of asole dioxide. Ocean is primarily composed of water, with small quantities of salt and asole dissolved within it. Ocean appears dark violet due to presence of asole. Lavender color of clouds is caused by small amount of asole, which is created when ocean's asolewater evaporates. ~Article texts [2] Asolate: Asolate is composed of asole and oxygen, formula is AO3, it acts like carbonate. [3] Asole: Asole is primarchic element, it’s nonmetallic and resembles purple material from Fortnite’s cube Kevin, group is C, atomic symbol is A and atomic number is 6. Appearance is violet crystal. Asole can be used for various applications, including food additives, paints, and metal alloy. Similar to sulfur and carbon but not flammable. Burning asole appears violet flames and produces asole dioxide (A2O). For example, iron asolide is chemical compound with formula FeA. Can be dissolved in water into asolewater like saltwater, clouds appears lavender and alien coal appears dark violet due to contains asoles, alien coals burn into flames appear violet due to contains asole.","completion":"The description of Õlk̍ṅ and its unique environment and elements—especially asole and asolate—presents a richly vivid and scientifically imaginative framework for an alien world. This planet, orbiting the gaseous giant Lṫeko̍y in a mysterious violet spiral galaxy, showcases a blend of speculative science fiction with a deeply detailed natural world. Here, the characteristics of asole and asolate, alongside the planet's environment, biology, and chemistry, are analyzed within a speculative scientific context: 1. **Atmospheric and Oceanic Composition**: The unique lavender color of Õlk̍ṅ's atmosphere and dark violet oceans stem from the presence of asole dioxide and asole, respectively. This atmospheric composition suggests a highly specialized adaptation of life forms on the planet, possibly developing protective measures against the specific wavelengths of light that penetrate this atmosphere. The presence of asole in the oceans, and the evaporation cycle carrying asole into the atmosphere, indicates a globally integrated bio-geochemical cycle centered around this element. 2. **Biology Adapting to Asole**: The violet plants using bacteriorhodopsin as an alternative to chlorophyll likely evolved to efficiently capture and use the planet's dominant light wavelengths. This adaptation suggests that the energy from Lṫeko̍y and its system's star(s) has unique characteristics, such as an abundance of wavelengths in the spectrum that bacteriorhodopsin can utilize more efficiently than chlorophyll. 3. **Asolate's Role**: Asolate (AO3), acting like a carbonate, indicates the presence of carbon-cycle analogues within Õlk̍ṅ's ecosystem. Carbonates on Earth play crucial roles in regulating carbon dioxide levels and thus maintaining a stable climate and atmosphere. Asolate could similarly participate in key geological and biological processes, possibly contributing to the lavender hue of clouds and aiding in the stability of the planet's climate. 4. **Asole's Utility and Chemistry**: Asole’s wide range of applications, from food additives to metal alloys, and its behavior (non-flammable, dissolvable in water, producing violet flames when burnt to form asole dioxide), showcases a material with unique chemical properties valuable for a technologically advanced civilization. The comparison to sulfur and carbon indicates its versatility and potential as a fundamental building block in Õlk̍ṅ's chemistry. 5. **Environmental Integration and Alien Civilization**: The advanced civilization on Õlk̍ṅ likely developed technologies that harness the unique properties of asole and asolate, integrated deeply with the natural cycles of their planet. The rarity and utility of these materials might be key factors contributing to the planet being \\"envied by other extraterrestrial civilizations.\\" 6. **Implications for Extraterrestrial Life**: The existence of lifeforms and an advanced civilization on Õlk̍ṅ, in concert with the planet's unique chemical, biological, and environmental features, suggests that life can emerge and thrive under conditions vastly different from those on Earth. This scenario serves as a speculative exploration of the diversity of life that could exist in the universe, based on different elemental foundations. In summary, the speculative details of Õlk̍ṅ and its chemical elements offer a fascinating glimpse into the complexity of creating a scientifically plausible yet alien ecosystem. The interplay between asole, asolate, and the planet's biology and chemistry showcases the imaginative possibilities for extraterrestrial life and environments, reminiscent of vast and diverse speculative universes in science fiction."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Hang on, where’s Natsuki?

Her most notable work, \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\" (1792), lays out her principal ideas and critiques of women's education and their role in society. Some key ideas from her work and thought include: 1. **Equality Between the Sexes**: Wollstonecraft argued for the inherent equality of men and women, challenging the prevailing belief of her time that women were naturally inferior to men. She claimed that any perceived differences in ability were the result of differences in education, not inherent ability. 2. **Education Reform**: Central to her argument was the belief that women should have an education commensurate with their position in society. She advocated for a rational education that would make women not just better wives and mothers (roles that were seen as their primary function during her time) but also capable of contributing to society as rational beings. She believed that both men and women should be educated together, arguing that this would foster mutual respect and enable them to act as moral and intellectual companions. 3. **Women's Independence**: Wollstonecraft was a proponent of women achieving independence, both financially and intellectually. She critiqued the way women were encouraged to be dependent on men, arguing that this dependence was degrading to both women and societal relationships. 4. **Criticism of Rousseau**: One of her significant intellectual battles was with the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, particularly his articulation of female education in \\"Émile, or On Education.\\" While Rousseau suggested that women should be educated for the pleasure of men, Wollstonecraft argued that women's education should not be designed to make them mere instruments of men but instead to develop their ability to think independently. 5. **Moral Improvement**: Wollstonecraft believed in the potential for progress and moral improvement in society. She saw the reformation of manners and the betterment of women's status and education as crucial steps toward a more equitable and just society. 6. **Role of Marriage**: She critiqued the institution of marriage as it existed in her time, viewing it as a form of legal prostitution wherein women were economically and socially dependent on their husbands. Wollstonecraft advocated for a marriage model based on equality and mutual affection. Mary Wollstonecraft's ideas were radical for her time and laid the groundwork for subsequent feminist thought and activism. Her emphasis on reason, education, and equality continues to influence feminist theory and the broader struggle for women's rights globally."},{"prompt":"what influenced mary wollstonecraft","completion":"Mary Wollstonecraft was influenced by a range of intellectual, social, and personal factors that shaped her groundbreaking work in feminist philosophy. Some of the most significant influences on her thought include: 1. **Enlightenment Philosophers**: Wollstonecraft was significantly influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly those related to reason, equality, and individual rights. Philosophers such as John Locke, whose work on tabula rasa suggested that knowledge comes from experience, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, despite her criticisms of his views on women, played roles in shaping her thoughts on education and human capabilities. 2. **Political Revolutions**: The American Revolution (1775-1783) and the French Revolution (1789-1799) played crucial roles in shaping Wollstonecraft's thinking. The principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity championed during these revolutions deeply influenced her views on societal structures, including the roles and rights of women. Her first political work, \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\\" (1790), was a response to Edmund Burke’s critique of the French Revolution, highlighting her support for the revolution’s principles. 3. **Personal Experiences**: Wollstonecraft's personal experiences greatly influenced her ideas and writings. Her struggles with financial instability, her observations of gender inequality within her family, and her experiences in working as a governess and schoolteacher exposed her to the limited opportunities available to women and the importance of education for improving their situations. Her relationships with men, including Gilbert Imlay and later William Godwin, also influenced her views on love, marriage, and independence. 4. **Literary and Intellectual Circles**: Wollstonecraft was part of vibrant literary and intellectual circles in London, which included radical thinkers and writers like Thomas Paine, William Blake, and her future husband, William Godwin. The intellectual exchange within these circles provided a fertile ground for her ideas to develop and flourish. 5. **Religion and Morality**: Although Wollstonecraft critiqued organized religion for its role in perpetuating women's oppression, her work is imbued with a moral fervor influenced by her early religious education and her belief in the innate capacity for goodness and rationality in individuals. Her moral framework emphasized virtue, reason, and independence, transcending the conventional religious norms of her time. 6. **Early Feminist Thought**: While Wollstonecraft is often regarded as a founding figure of feminist thought, she was also influenced by earlier writers who advocated for women’s education and improved status in society. Works by women writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, like Mary Astell’s \\"A Serious Proposal to the Ladies\\" (1694), which advocated for better education for women, also served as a backdrop to Wollstonecraft’s ideas. The synthesis of these influences resulted in Wollstonecraft's unique contribution to political and feminist thought, advocating for the rights and education of women on the basis of their shared human capacity for reason and moral judgment."},{"prompt":"what were mary wollstonecraft's political views, with direct reference to her works","completion":"Mary Wollstonecraft's political views were largely shaped by Enlightenment principles, emphasizing reason, liberty, and equality. Her key political works, \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\\" (1790) and \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\" (1792), along with her other writings, articulate her advocacy for social and political reform, especially concerning the rights and education of women. Here’s a breakdown of her key political views with direct reference to her works: # 1. **Equality and Rights** In \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,\\" Wollstonecraft argues for the fundamental equality of men and women, challenging the prevailing social norms that women were inherently inferior to men. She asserts that women appear to be inferior only because of their lack of education and the limited opportunities available to them. She contends that women, like men, are entitled to the same natural rights and should be given equal opportunities for education: > \\"I do not wish [women] to have power over men; but over themselves.\\" - Chapter 4, \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\" # 2. **Education** Education is a central theme in Wollstonecraft's political thought. She advocates for a rational education system that promotes virtue and wisdom over superficial accomplishments, which were often the focus of women's education in her time. Wollstonecraft argues that a true reform in education would nurture rational, moral individuals capable of contributing positively to society: > \\"Let us in the education of women not lose sight of their peculiar designation, the care of the heart\\" - Chapter 12, \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\" # 3. **Republicanism and Critique of Monarchy** In \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Men,\\" Wollstonecraft responds to Edmund Burke’s conservative critique of the French Revolution, defending the revolution's principles and advocating for a republican form of government over monarchy. She criticizes hereditary privilege and the accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of a few, arguing for a society based on merit and equal opportunity: > \\"The mass of mankind are not born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them.\\" - \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\\" # 4. **Social Reform** Wollstonecraft's works reflect her broader concerns with social reform, including the abolition of slavery and the reform of marriage laws. She seeks a society where all individuals, regardless of gender or class, can achieve their full potential. Her vision extends to a restructuring of social relations based on mutual respect and understanding, rather than dominance and subordination. # 5. **Critique of Gender Norms** Throughout her writings, Wollstonecraft challenges traditional gender norms and the relegation of women to the domestic sphere. She critiques the prevailing notion that women were naturally destined for marriage and motherhood, arguing instead for women's participation in the public and political realms: > \\"I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of mind and body...\\" - Introduction, \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\" Mary Wollstonecraft's political views were revolutionary for her time. Through her advocacy for women's rights, education, and broader social and political reform, she laid the groundwork for modern feminist thought and remains a seminal figure in the history of political philosophy."},{"prompt":"what are wollstonecraft's main arguments in VIndication on the Rights of Men","completion":"\\"A Vindication of the Rights of Men,\\" in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) is Mary Wollstonecraft's first political work and a direct response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\" (1790). Burke's work argued for the preservation of traditional institutions, including monarchy and the aristocracy, and criticized the French Revolution for its potential to destabilize society and overthrow these institutions. Wollstonecraft's \\"Vindication of the Rights of Men\\" counters Burke's conservative views, advocating for reason, liberty, and equality. Her main arguments in this work include: # 1. **Critique of Aristocracy and Hereditary Privilege** Wollstonecraft challenges the foundations of Burke's argument, which idealizes the nobility and hereditary privilege. She criticizes the notion that individuals should inherit positions of power and wealth without earning them, arguing instead for a society based on merit. Wollstonecraft sees no rational basis for a system that elevates people not on their virtues or talents but merely on the accident of their birth. # 2. **Equality and Natural Rights** Wollstonecraft extends the Enlightenment ideas of equality and natural rights, arguing that all humans are entitled to certain rights by virtue of their humanity. She disputes the idea that society should be divided rigidly into classes, with different rights and privileges attached to these classes. # 3. **The Importance of Reason** Echoing Enlightenment thinkers, Wollstonecraft emphasizes the role of reason in guiding human affairs. She criticizes Burke for appealing to emotion and tradition rather than reason and argues that a rational examination of society and its institutions would lead to more equitable and just arrangements. # 4. **Critique of Monarchy** Taking aim directly at the institution of monarchy and those who defend it (like Burke), Wollstonecraft argues against the tyranny of monarchical rule. She supports the idea of a republic where leaders are chosen based on merit rather than heredity. # 5. **Social Reform** Implicit in Wollstonecraft's arguments is a call for broad social reform. She touches on issues such as poverty, education, and the rights of men (in a general sense, which also paves the way for her later arguments about the rights of women). She sees the social and economic inequalities of her day as interconnected with the political system that perpetuates them. # 6. **Religious Sentiment** Wollstonecraft also critiques Burke's romanticization of chivalry and church institutions, advocating instead for a kind of practical Christianity focused on genuine morality, compassion, and social justice, rather than the pomp and circumstance of religious and aristocratic traditions. # 7. **Defending the French Revolution** While her defense is nuanced and she is not uncritical of all aspects of the French Revolution, Wollstonecraft defends the Revolution's principles of liberty and equality against Burke's disdain. She sees the Revolution as a hopeful beginning for the reformation of society along more rational and just lines. In \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\\", Wollstonecraft lays the groundwork for her later feminist arguments by advocating for rationality, meritocracy, and equality. Her critique of Burke put her at the heart of political debate and showcased her as a formidable intellectual and advocate for reform."},{"prompt":"what are john stuart mill's main ideas","completion":"John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) was a British philosopher, political economist, and civil servant who made significant contributions to social theory, political theory, and economics. He is considered one of the most influential English-speaking philosophers of the 19th century. Mill's main ideas revolve around the principles of liberty, the role of individuality, the limits of government intervention, and the importance of utilitarianism as an ethical framework. Here are some of his key concepts, primarily drawn from his most famous works, \\"On Liberty\\" (1859) and \\"Utilitarianism\\" (1863), among others: # 1. **Liberty and Harm Principle** In \\"On Liberty,\\" Mill argues for the importance of individual freedom and autonomy. He posits the \\"Harm Principle,\\" stating that individuals should be free to act however they wish, unless their actions harm others. This principle is foundational for discussions on the limits of state and societal power over individuals. # 2. **Utilitarianism** Mill is perhaps best known for his promotion of utilitarianism, an ethical theory that proposes actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite of happiness. In \\"Utilitarianism,\\" Mill refines the utilitarian theory initially developed by Jeremy Bentham, emphasizing not just the quantity of happiness but the quality of it. He argues that higher (intellectual and moral) pleasures should be weighted more heavily than lower (bodily) pleasures. # 3. **Freedom of Speech and Expression** Mill passionately defends freedom of speech and expression, arguing that free discourse is necessary for the pursuit of truth. He posits that even false opinions have value because they challenge society to reaffirm and better understand the truth. Thus, silencing any opinion is wrongful because it robs humanity of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth. # 4. **Women's Rights and Gender Equality** In \\"The Subjection of Women\\" (1869), Mill advocates for gender equality and women's rights. He argues that both genders should have equal rights and opportunities since there is no natural inferiority of one sex over the other. This work is considered foundational in the field of feminist philosophy. # 5. **Individuality and Self-Development** Mill places a strong emphasis on individuality and self-development as essential components of a well-functioning society and a fulfilling life. He argues that society and its institutions should allow, and even encourage, individuals to pursue their own paths, as long as they do not harm others. # 6. **Representative Government and Democratic Participation** In \\"Considerations on Representative Government\\" (1861), Mill discusses the best form of government, arguing in favor of representative democracy. He suggests that participation in political life is crucial for individual development and the welfare of society. Mill also discusses the importance of education in preparing citizens for participation in democracy. # 7. **Economic Ideas on Liberty and Utility** Though a proponent of capitalism, Mill recognizes the limitations of laissez-faire economics. He supports government intervention in the economy to protect workers, reduce poverty, and ensure fairness. His economic views seek a balance between individual liberty and the collective good, reflecting his broader utilitarian philosophy. John Stuart Mill's ideas have had a lasting impact on liberal thought, advocating for a society that maximizes freedom, happiness, and well-being, while emphasizing the importance of individuality, reason, and equitable treatment of all members of society."},{"prompt":"what were the main ideas of john rawls","completion":"John Rawls (1921-2002) was an American political philosopher in the liberal tradition, whose work revived interest in the disciplines of political and moral philosophy in the Anglo-American world. His theory of justice as fairness, presented in his seminal work, \\"A Theory of Justice\\" (1971), along with later works such as \\"Political Liberalism\\" (1993), introduced concepts that have since become cornerstones of contemporary political philosophy. Here are some of his main ideas: # 1. **Justice as Fairness** Rawls posits that the principles of justice are those that everyone would agree to under fair conditions, which he describes using the original position and the veil of ignorance. In the original position, individuals select principles of justice without knowing anything about their personal abilities, race, class, or social status—a situation ensured by the veil of ignorance. This theoretical construct is designed to ensure fairness and impartiality in the derivation of principles of justice. # 2. **Two Principles of Justice** From the original position, Rawls argues that two principles of justice would be chosen: - **First Principle (Equal Liberty Principle):** Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others. - **Second Principle (Difference Principle and Equal Opportunity Principle):** Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage, and (b) attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. # 3. **The Priority of Liberty** Rawls contends that the first principle (equal liberty) has priority over the second (economic and social inequalities). This means that basic liberties cannot be compromised for the sake of social or economic benefits. In turn, the Equal Opportunity Principle has a priority over the Difference Principle, ensuring that opportunities are not sacrificed for economic efficiency or welfare. # 4. **Original Position and Veil of Ignorance** The original position is a hypothetical situation in which individuals choose the principles of justice that will govern their society, without knowing their own place in that society. The veil of ignorance strips away knowledge of their individual characteristics—such as race, class, gender, and personal talents—ensuring that the principles chosen are fair and impartial. # 5. **Overlapping Consensus** In \\"Political Liberalism,\\" Rawls introduces the concept of overlapping consensus, a way for citizens in a pluralistic society to agree on political principles without having to agree on every aspect of ethical, moral, or religious doctrine. This concept is crucial for the stability of a democratic society according to Rawls, as it allows for a shared agreement on justice that respects diversity. # 6. **Public Reason** Rawls argues that public reason is the mode of reasoning appropriate for democratic societies when discussing constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice. It involves citizens reasoning together in the public sphere by presenting arguments others can reasonably be expected to endorse. Public reason is a key component of a well-ordered society where free and equal citizens justify political actions according to principles all can accept. John Rawls' contribution to political theory, especially his development of justice as fairness, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing inequalities in a liberal democratic society, compelling philosophers, political theorists, and policymakers to re-examine the foundations and aims of social justice."},{"prompt":"what were the main ideas of betty friedan","completion":"Betty Friedan (1921-2006) was a leading figure in the American feminist movement, best known for her 1963 book, *The Feminine Mystique*. This groundbreaking work is credited with sparking the second wave of feminism in the United States. Friedan's ideas challenged the prevailing notions of women's roles in society and helped to catalyze changes in both the public perception of gender roles and the legal framework supporting gender equality. Here are some of her main ideas: # 1. **The Problem That Has No Name** Friedan identified \\"the problem that has no name\\" as the widespread unhappiness of many women in the 1950s and early 1960s, who were living in a society that idealized the roles of wife and mother as the ultimate fulfillment of womanhood. Despite material comfort and family, many women felt unfulfilled and trapped in a monotonous cycle of domestic tasks, experiencing a profound sense of emptiness. # 2. **Critique of Consumer Culture and Media Representation** Friedan critiqued the consumer culture of the post-World War II era for promoting a narrow definition of womanhood focused on domesticity and passive femininity. She argued that media representations, including magazines and advertising, reinforced the idea that women's roles were confined to the home, thereby limiting their potential and contributions to society. # 3. **Education and Career Opportunities for Women** Friedan strongly advocated for women's education and access to a full range of career opportunities. She argued that fulfilling one's potential was essential for personal development and happiness, challenging the societal expectation that women should find complete fulfillment in homemaking and child-rearing. # 4. **Sexual Discrimination and Need for Legal Reforms** Friedan highlighted the extent to which institutions, including government and workplaces, discriminated against women. She called for legal reforms to ensure equality in employment, education, and in the legal rights of women. Her work contributed to the momentum behind the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, particularly Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. # 5. **The Feminine Mystique and Women's Identity** Central to Friedan's critique was the concept of the \\"feminine mystique,\\" the idealization of female domesticity, which she argued was a constructed identity that women were socialized into adopting. This mystique encouraged women to find identity and meaning through their husbands and children rather than through their own achievements and interests. # 6. **Political and Social Activism** Beyond identifying problems, Friedan was an active organizer for women's rights. She was a founding member of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966, which aimed to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society. Through NOW, Friedan advocated for political action and policy changes to achieve gender equality. # 7. **Broadening the Feminist Movement** Friedan's later work attempted to broaden the feminist movement to include women of different social and economic backgrounds. She emphasized the need for a more inclusive movement that addressed issues of concern to all women, not just middle-class white women. She also recognized the importance of involving men in the feminist movement, understanding that true equality required changing the roles and expectations of both women and men. Betty Friedan's ideas, particularly those expressed in *The Feminine Mystique*, were instrumental in articulating the discontent felt by many women and served as a catalyst for the modern feminist movement. Her advocacy for women's rights and her work in creating organizations to support these goals have left a lasting legacy in the struggle for gender equality."},{"prompt":"what are the beliefs of classical liberals","completion":"Classical liberalism is a political ideology that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, advocating for individual freedom, limited government, and the rule of law. The beliefs of classical liberals are rooted in the desire to protect individual liberties and promote economic freedom. While there is considerable diversity among the views of those who are considered classical liberals, several core beliefs define this school of thought: # 1. **Individual Liberty** Classical liberals place a high value on individual freedom, believing that individuals should be free to pursue their own lives, make their own decisions, and express themselves as they see fit, as long as they do not harm others. This includes freedoms of speech, religion, and association. # 2. **Limited Government** A central tenet of classical liberalism is the belief in a government that is limited in its powers and primarily exists to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens. Classical liberals argue for a constitutional government where the powers of the state are restricted to avoid tyranny and protect individual rights. # 3. **Rule of Law** The rule of law is another important concept, emphasizing that laws should be clear, public, and applied equally to all individuals, with an independent judiciary to enforce them. This principle is crucial for protecting individuals from arbitrary power and ensuring legal equality. # 4. **Economic Freedom** Classical liberals advocate for free markets and minimal government intervention in the economy. They believe that economic freedom is essential for individual liberty and prosperity, arguing that markets, when left relatively free, are the most efficient and equitable way to allocate resources. # 5. **Property Rights** Protection of private property is seen as fundamental by classical liberals. They argue that property rights ensure economic stability and are essential for personal freedom and autonomy. Property rights include not only land and possessions but also intellectual property and one's own labor. # 6. **Free Trade** In line with their support for economic freedom, classical liberals often advocate for free trade between nations, opposing protectionism. They believe that free trade leads to increased prosperity for all countries involved, through the efficient distribution of resources and specialization according to comparative advantage. # 7. **Individual Responsibility** Classical liberalism emphasizes personal responsibility, with individuals expected to take care of themselves and their families, rather than relying on state welfare. However, some classical liberals do acknowledge a limited role for the state in providing a safety net for the truly needy. # 8. **Skepticism of Power** A deep skepticism of concentrated power, whether in the hands of the government, corporations, or any other institutions, is a hallmark of classical liberalism. This is based on the belief that power tends to corrupt and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. # Influential Thinkers Thinkers commonly associated with classical liberalism include John Locke, who emphasized natural rights and the social contract; Adam Smith, who is often called the father of modern economics and advocated for the \\"invisible hand\\" of the market; and John Stuart Mill, who argued for liberty and individualism in both social and economic spheres. Classical liberalism has significantly influenced the development of Western political thought and institutions, laying the foundation for modern democratic societies and economic systems. Its principles continue to inform contemporary political debates, particularly around issues of government size and scope, market regulation, and individual freedoms."},{"prompt":"guh","completion":"It seems like you might have entered something by mistake.

Unless the state is given some autonomy, it cannot work for the common affairs of the money-making class and for hegemonic fractions of this class. Nor can it perform functions in support of the general affairs of society which are important whether or not a society is capitalist (e.g. dealing with a pandemic). Indeed, regardless of the class character of state actors, ‘the role of the state in administering or overseeing a large-scale national community ensures that certain of its activities (e.g. upholding certain kinds of criminal law or traffic regulations such as the Highway Code) must be “classless” in the sense that they are indispensable to the running of any industrialised urban society’ (Creaven, 2000: 268). The fact that a part of society — the capitalist state — needs to look after the common affairs of the society as a whole (these are not necessarily the same as the common affairs of the capitalist class) contributes to, and requires, a degree of autonomy of the state. This autonomy is then used by the ruling class and is given a class colour: when the state does operate on behalf of an entire capitalist society, this functioning is mediated by capitalist class interests. This is seen, for example, in the relation between the state’s attempt to keep society ‘crime free’ and the prison-industrial complex, or between the state’s attempt to defend a country against foreign enemies and the military-industrial complex, or indeed between the state’s attempt to fight a pandemic and the healthcare-industrial complex that churns billionaires when millions die. The so-called class-neutral functions of the capitalist state end up having a class character, because the state is inherently the capitalist state. Generally speaking, given the conflicts of interests among capitalists, self-interested capitalists as capitalists might not be great administrators to look after the common affairs of the capitalist class as a whole. There are all kinds of conflicts within the capitalist class within a country and globally. Within a country, there are different competing ‘regional group interests, different industrial interests, antagonisms within an industry, rivalry between producers of consumers’ and producers’ goods, light and heavy industry, and so on, aside from religious, political, and other ideological differences’ (Draper, 1977: 323). This fact ‘makes it more difficult for any individual capitalist to be trusted as executor for the class as a whole’ (ibid.). For example, during times of social upheavals from below, ‘concessions may have to be made to the class enemy below, the working classes’ (ibid.). But if concessions have to be made, who will pay for them? At a given point, to the extent that state’s revenue is a given, if more goes to the masses, which section of the dominant class is made to sacrifice and how? It would be difficult for capitalists acting as state actors to decide. Therefore, a ‘built-in characteristic of capitalism . . . minimizes the functioning of capitalists themselves as state administrators or managers’, and there is a need for ‘finding political leaders who can take, and stick to, an overall and farsighted view of the interests and needs of the system as a whole’ (p. 324). However, one should not have too dim a view of capitalists being able to manage the common affairs of society as well as functions in support of the capitalist class including its hegemonic fractions. One has to just consider how many capitalists increasingly occupy important positions within the state. So the inability of the capitalist class for its self-rule is only relative, just as the autonomy of the state actors qua state actors is relative.9 As indicated already, while the state’s main task is to look after the common economic and political affairs of the capitalists, the very idea of common affairs implies that there are different interests too, and this implies a degree of autonomy on the part of the state. That is, to be able to manage the common affairs, the state has to have a degree of autonomy vis-à-vis short-term interests of capital as a whole and vis-à-vis short-term or long-term interests of specific capitalists (this is acknowledged even by scholars such as Miliband). The fact that there is competition in the economic sphere among capitalists (or indeed between capitalists and landlords as in many LDCs) does require that the state as a structure of relations have a degree of autonomy to be able to resolve conflicts among them.10 It is the autonomy of this structure of relations that is enjoyed by state actors, the bearers of that structure, and their autonomy in turn influences state functions. A bureaucrat/politician, who is a mere rolling stone, and who lacks his/her own voice, like a president of a chamber of commerce, would not be taken seriously. Even the most obedient servant needs a degree of autonomy which the master is happy to provide, because otherwise the master will be using much time and resource in directing the servant at every step. Indeed, to be able to function in a context where capitalists themselves may not agree on what a good policy might be when, for example, it comes to foreign investment in insurance or industrialization in indigenous areas and so on, a degree of autonomy on the part of the structure of the state and state actors is necessary. In fact, in certain conditions acting as representatives of the private property owners, the bureaucracy can create specific types of private property owners such as the capitalist class.11 It is not just that interests of competing capitalists are different. Capitalists’ interests, at a fundamental level, are incompatible with those of the common people, so there is an objective need to represent what are the interests of capitalists as the interests of the nation as a whole. Here the ideas of influential state actors (officials and politicians) about the national interest and how it might overlap with the interest of the capitalist class are crucial. (In this context, Miliband’s partnership idea is a useful one.) For the state to operate in the interest of the capitalist class (and of society as a whole), it needs resources (in the form of taxes and the like). An enormous amount of value (social wealth) passes through the state (almost a third of the GDP of countries), giving enormous economic power to the state vis-à-vis any individual capitalist or group of capitalists. This economic power, which is a part of the basis for its autonomy, is enjoyed by the state actors. While ultimately capitalists’ action is driven by the fact that they have to make an average rate of profit and a significant mass of profit, state actors’ action is driven by the fact that they must ensure reproduction of capitalist relations and help capitalists accumulate value. Yet, within these limits, state actors have their own interests to pursue too. These include careerism, accumulation of wealth in extra-economic ways — through collaboration with capitalists and large-scale landowners, winning elections, or obtaining some form of legitimation from common people in support of their rule.12 Marx (1843) writes, ‘As far as the individual bureaucrat is concerned, the end of the state becomes his private end: a pursuit of higher posts, the building of a career.’ State actors do pursue their own interests because doing so is beneficial to them. They can pursue their interests because the structure of the state has given them some autonomy to. The state bureaucracy might seek to ‘make gains for itself at the expense of others’ (Harman, 1991), that is, capitalists and other groups. Of course, how far they can go in this direction depends on how well capitalists (and others) exercise their agency. In response to state actors actions that might hurt capitalists, capitalists might ‘use their own special position — industrial capital its ability to postpone investment, money capital its ability to move overseas — to fight back’ (Harman, 1991). In pursuing their own interests, state actors may end up doing things that are not exactly in the capitalists’ short-term interests, and indeed they can pursue their own interests which are relatively independent of capitalists’ inter- ests.13 There can be conflicts, within limits, between autonomously acting state actors and capitalists with their ultimate economic veto power. Certain actors can be a little reformist in relation to the masses and/or may pursue their own interests and may therefore implement policies which may be seen as a drain on the surplus value in the eyes of the capitalists.14 State actors’ perception of what is needed to promote capitalist accumulation may not exactly coincide with the objective interests of the capitalist class and of its individual segments. State actors, and especially politicians, can be seen as being involved in an M-C-M'-like circuit in politics whereby politicians invest money (M) to bribe poor voters and opposition party representatives and on political propaganda and political violence (e.g. physical coercion against opponents) in order to manufacture a political commodity, called governmental power I which is then used as an instrument to make more money (M') than invested. Similarly, state officials (especially those at the higher echelons) invest money (in the form of bribing politicians and/or other officials) to occupy certain posts that can generate a lot of rent (bribe). So they are also involved in an M-C-M'-like circuit. If capitalists and their political representatives as well as state bureaucrats make more money than invested, where is the money coming from: it ultimately comes from workers/voters not getting the money they need to meet their needs. There is a limit to the state actors’ self-interested actions; these actions cannot undermine conditions for accumulation too much and too long. These limits are set by capitalism as a structure of relations setting limit on the state as another structure of relations. Accumulation provides employment without which there might be a crisis of legitimation for specific regimes and indeed for the state. Accumulation is a source of taxes and loans for the state itself as long as the state remains bourgeois.15 The consequent pressure on the state as a structure to earn its revenue is manifested as the pressure on the top layer of the bureaucracy: ‘the directing layer in the state bureaucracy is dependent upon successful capitalist exploitation and accumulation’ without which it cannot get the revenues it requires, including ‘for its own privileges and its own functioning’ (Harman, 1991). So state actors are forced to provide conditions that promote capital accumulation within the geographical boundaries of the state. Mandel (1969) says, the fact that capitalist class ‘in large part fills the coffers of the state’ and thus pays ‘for the upkeep of the state’ means that it ‘will demand that the latter place itself completely at their service’ through its laws and institutions.”翻译为中文","completion":"赚钱的行为和治理的行为代表了社会分工。除非国家获得一定的自主权，否则它无法为赚钱阶层及其霸权分子的共同事务工作。国家也无法支持对社会普遍重要的共同事务（比如应对大流行）。实际上，不管国家行为者的阶级性质如何，“国家在管理或监督一个大规模国家社区的角色确保了其某些活动（例如，维护某些类型的刑事法律或交通规则，如公路法典）必须是‘无阶级’的，因为这对任何工业化城市社会的运转都是必不可少的”（Creaven, 2000: 268）。一个社会的一部分——资本主义国家——需要照顾整个社会的共同事务（这些事务不一定与资本主义阶级的共同事务相同），这既促成了也需要国家的一定程度的自主权。这种自主性随后被统治阶级利用，并被赋予阶级色彩：当国家代表整个资本主义社会运作时，其功能是通过资本主义阶级利益的调解。例如，在国家试图保持社会“无犯罪”与监狱工业复合体之间的关系，国家试图抵御外敌与军事工业复合体之间的关系，或确实在国家试图对抗大流行与制造亿万富翁的医疗保健工业复合体之间的关系时可以看到这一点，这些是在数以百万计的人死亡时发生的。所谓的资本主义国家的无阶级功能最终具有阶级性质，因为国家本质上是资本主义国家。 一般来说，鉴于资本家之间的利益冲突，以资本家的身份行事的自私的资本家可能不擅长管理资本主义阶级整体的共同事务。在一个国家内部和全球范围内，资本主义阶级内部存在各种冲突。在国家内部，存在不同的竞争“地区集团利益，不同的工业利益，行业内的对立，消费品生产者和生产者之间的竞争，轻工业和重工业等，还有除此之外的宗教、政治和其他意识形态差异”（Draper, 1977: 323）。这一事实“使任何单个资本家被视为整个阶级的执行者变得更加困难”（同上）。例如，在来自下层的社会动荡时期，“可能不得不对下面的阶级敌人，即工人阶级，做出让步”（同上）。但如果必须做出让步，谁来支付费用？在给定的情况下，只要国家的收入是给定的，如果更多的钱流向大众，那么哪一部分占主导地位的阶级被迫牺牲，以及如何牺牲？因此，担任国家行动者的资本家很难决定。因此，资本主义的一个“内在特征……最小化了资本家本身作为国家管理者或经理的运作”，需要“寻找可以从整体和远见的角度考虑系统整体的利益和需求的政治领导人”（第324页）。 然而，不应该过于悲观地看待资本家管理社会共同事务以及支持资本主义阶级及其霸权分子的功能。只需考虑有多少资本家日益在国家内占据重要位置。因此，资本主义阶级自我统治的无能是相对的，正如国家行动者作为国家行动者的自主性也是相对的。正如已经指出的，尽管国家的主要任务是照顾资本家的共同经济和政治事务，但共同事务的概念意味着存在不同的利益，这就暗示了国家在某种程度上的自主性。也就是说，为了能够管理共同事务，国家必须对整个资本的短期利益以及特定资本家的短期或长期利益有一定程度的自主性（甚至像Miliband这样的学者也承认这一点）。资本家之间在经济领域的竞争（或确实资本家与许多最不发达国家的地主之间的竞争）确实要求国家作为一种关系结构具有一定程度的自主性，以能够解决他们之间的冲突。这种关系结构的自主性是由该结构的承载者，即国家行动者享有的，而他们的自主性反过来又影响国家职能。 一个没有自己声音的流浪政治家/官僚，就像一个商会会长，是不会被认真对待的。即使是最服从的仆人也需要一定程度的自主性，而主人乐意提供这种自主性，否则主人将在指导仆人的每一步上花费大量时间和资源。实际上，为了能够在资本家本身可能对什么是好政策（例如，关于保险中的外国投资或在土著地区的工业化等）不一致的情况下发挥作用，国家结构和国家行动者的一定程度的自主性是必要的。实际上，在某些条件下，作为私有财产所有者的代表，官僚机构可以创造特定类型的私有财产所有者，如资本主义阶级。 并不是说竞争资本家的利益不同。从根本上说，资本家的利益与普通人民的利益不兼容，因此客观上需要将资本家的利益作为整个国家的利益来代表。这里，有影响力的国家行动者（官员和政治家）对国家利益以及它可能与资本主义阶级利益的重叠怎样的看法是至关重要的。（在这种情况下，Miliband的伙伴关系想法是一个有用的想法。） 为了让国家能够符合资本主义阶级（和整个社会）的利益，它需要资源（税收等形式）。大量的价值（社会财富）通过国家流动（几乎是国家GDP的三分之一），给予国家相对于任何单个资本家或资本家集团的巨大经济权力。这种经济权力是其自主性基础的一部分，被国家行动者享有。 虽然最终资本家的行动是由他们必须获得平均利润率和大量利润的事实驱动的，但国家行动者的行动是由他们必须确保资本主义关系的再生产并帮助资本家累积价值的事实驱动的。然而，在这些限制之内，国家行动者也有自己的利益要追求。这些包括事业主义，通过与资本家和大土地所有者的合作，在选举中获胜，或从普通民众那里获得对他们统治的某种形式的合法性认可等方式以非经济方式积累财富。马克思（1843）写道，“就单个官僚而言，国家的终极目标成为他的私人目标：追求更高的职位，建立职业生涯。”国家行动者追求自己的利益，因为这样做对他们有益。他们之所以能追求自己的利益，是因为国家的结构给了他们一定的自主性。国家官僚可能寻求“以牺牲他人为代价为自己谋取利益”（Harman, 1991），即资本家和其他群体。当然，他们能在这个方向上走多远取决于资本家（和其他人）如何行使他们的能动性。作为对可能伤害资本家的国家行动者行动的回应，资本家可能“利用他们自己的特殊位置——工业资本可以延迟投资，金融资本可以移至海外——进行反击”（Harman, 1991）。 在追求自己的利益时，国家行动者可能会做一些并不完全符合资本家短期利益的事情，事实上，他们可以追求自己相对独立于资本家利益的利益。在限制之内，自主行动的国家行动者与拥有最终经济否决权的资本家之间可以存在冲突。某些行动者可能在对待群众方面有点改革性和/或可能追求自己的利益，因此可能实施被视为资本家利润的消耗的政策。国家行动者对促进资本积累所需的看法可能与资本主义阶级及其各个部分的客观利益不完全一致。 国家行动者，尤其是政治家，可以被视为涉及政治中的M-C-M'-式的循环，其中政治家投资金钱（M）贿赂穷人选民和反对党代表以及政治宣传和政治暴力（例如，对对手的身体强制）以制造政治商品，称为政府权力I，然后使用它作为工具来赚取比投资更多的钱（M'）。同样，国家官员（尤其是高层官员）投资金钱（以贿赂政治家和/或其他官员的形式）占据可以产生大量租金（贿赂）的职位。因此，他们也参与了M-C-M'-式的循环。如果资本家及其政治代表以及国家官僚投资的钱比花费的多，那么这些钱最终来自哪里：这最终来自工人/选民没有获得满足他们需要的钱。 国家行动者自私行为的限度；这些行动不能太多也不能太久地破坏积累条件。这些限制由资本主义作为一种关系结构对国家作为另一种关系结构设定的。积累提供就业，否则可能会出现特定政权乃至国家合法性的危机。积累是国家自身作为一个资产阶级国家获得税收和贷款的来源。“指导层在国家官僚机构中依赖于成功的资本家剥削和积累”，如果没有这个，他们就无法获得所需的收入，包括“为了其自身的特权和其自身的运作”（Harman, 1991）。因此，国家行动者被迫提供促进资本积累的条件，这些条件在国家的地理边界内。Mandel（1969）说，资本主义阶级“在很大程度上填满了国家的金库”，因此支付了“国家的维护费用”，这意味着它“将要求后者通过其法律和机构完全为他们服务”。"},{"prompt":"请将“Of course, I would argue, this financial reliance of the state is derivative and conjunctural. Institutional separation — of the state from the profit-oriented market economy (i.e. the fact that state institutions are not the headquarters of big companies) — does not mean processual separation between the state and the private sector. What the state does or does not do, either in the interest of a country as a whole (to the extent that economic growth benefits both capitalists and workers) or in the interests of the masses is fundamentally driven by state’s class character — that is, its need to support economic and political interests of the exploiting class — and not primarily because of its own dependence on capitalists. Such dependence does exist. It exists at a more concrete level. And it does have important effects on capitalists and non-capitalist classes. 4 Limits to state function in support of capitalist interests The state can create general conditions for capitalist development by connecting to every step in the M-C-M' circuit, as we have seen in Chapter 7. Conversely, its actions, intentionally or not, can impede the development of productive forces under capitalism. ‘The state power has been able . . . to cooperate with capitalist development.’16 Or it can ‘put brakes on it’ (Trotsky, 1991: 212). While the state promotes capitalist accumulation in various ways, there are limits to the extent to which the state succeeds and can succeed in doing so. These limits are given in the concrete mechanisms creating conditions for capitalist accumulation. This is for various reasons. Firstly, given its derivative dependence on the capitalist class for its survival (tax dependence), the state has limited resources in its hands at any given point in time, and this limits what state actors can do for capitalists (and in their own interests). The state can help capitalists — for example, it can help a relatively weak enterprise under its jurisdiction to close the gap between its own value and the social value — but there are strong limits to any given state doing this because the state is subordinated to the law of value operating at the global scale, the law that ultimately determines how much value (or, money) will pass through the state. Secondly, since the state is ‘separate’ from the sphere of production, it only reacts to accumulation crisis.17 Besides, specific policies may not be adequate to capitalist accumulation (Jessop, 2012: 340; Jessop, 2006: 418) because within structural limits (e.g. the limit to protect property rights, commodity relations, and so on), ‘there will always be more than one possible ‘accumulation strategy’ (Jessop, 1990: 159). The different capitalists may have different interests and different ideas about their interests, and they might contradict each other. Accumulation strategies must advance the immediate interests of the different fractions of capital (located in different territories) and must secure the longterm interests of the hegemonic fraction, at least, which must, in turn, sacrifice some of its short-term economic interests. It is not an easy task to figure out what these will be in a context where different fractions of capital have different interests and where capitalists and workers are antagonistically related. No capitalist fraction knows exactly what policies are needed at the level of the whole economy, especially if the economy is constantly crisis-prone. Trial and error is one of the methods in which specific pro-business policies are arrived at. But the bureaucratic state is not always equipped to innovatively think about new actions that are needed as it is best designed to follow fixed legal structures in processing certain inputs (Offe, 1984). Thirdly, a given intervention can be contradictory: certain positive impacts of an action might be nullified by its negative impacts. Some people think that military expenditures are good for capitalist accumulation. Luxemburg (1913) says: militarism is a ‘pre-eminent means for the realisation of surplus-value; it is in itself a province of accumulation’. For Harvey (2008b), the importance of the wars is that value is destroyed creating opportunities for the production of new value. From a class fractional approach (from the standpoint of certain capitalists), this might sound reasonable: the favourable impact of militarism on capitalist accumulation ‘is how things may appear from the standpoint of individual capital as military supplies have always been the occasion for rapid enrichment’ (Grossman, 1929). But from the standpoint of capital as a whole, ‘militarism is a sphere of unproductive consumption’ in the sense that ‘[i]nstead of being saved, values are pulverised’. This means that ‘[f]ar from being a sphere of accumulation, militarism slows down accumulation’ as ‘a major share of the income of the working class’ which the state secures through indirect taxation and which ‘might have gone into the hands of the capitalists as surplus value is seized by the state and spent mainly for unproductive purposes’ (ibid.). Similarly, if the state reduces/eliminates support for the unemployed (unem-ployment insurance), it may reduce its expenses to the delight of capitalists who are always for austerity, and it may reduce the wages by weakening the bargaining power of workers, but without the state support, unemployed people may not be available in a place for capitalists to take advantage of them. The reserve army must be in situ. To cite another instance, if the state invests more in support of capital it is good for capital, but increased state borrowing may raise interest rate which adversely affects capital (and not just capital) (Resnick and Wolff, 2006: 319). Fourthly, the more intense demands on the state can threaten to overburden it. Policies of the state can pose a threat to the dominance of the capitalist exchange relations. The more the state is involved in the economy, the less the investment opportunities for certain segments of capital there are, and the greater is the proportion of the social surplus product that it absorbs, which could otherwise be in the hands of the capitalist class.18 While the economic purpose — maintaining conditions for capitalist economic development — is a prime motive of the state, the state does engage in various non-economic activities that can undermine conditions for capitalist development. Fifthly, the capitalist state cannot be solely concerned with benefitting the capitalist class. A hegemonic class must ensure that there is a space within which the state meets the interests of non-capitalist classes and class fractions, including large-scale landowners, and top layers of state actors. To be the capitalist state, the state does not have to be exclusively concerned with the capitalist class. In fact, the state has to relate to all the classes, to the totality of capitalist class society. The state seeks to meet the needs of non-capitalist classes from time to time, in howsoever limited a manner; it must meet the common socialecological needs of all classes (laws of marriage, traffic lights, pandemic, global warming), even if the ways in which it meets the common needs are shaped by its capitalist character. To the extent that the interests of the capitalist class are fundamentally incompatible with those of the workers (as well as small-scale producers), the fact that the state must meet the needs of the non-capitalist classes puts a limit to the extent to which the state can meet the needs of the capitalist class at a point in time, even if welfare policies create a market for capitalists. After all, every deduction from the surplus value that does not go to the capitalist class is considered to be a loss to that class, other things constant. Sixthly, the capitalist class needs to make money, and for this to happen certain cultural-political conditions need to be created, and these conditions may not be necessarily conducive to profit-making in any direct sense. If to divert attention from the failure of capitalists and their state to better the working and living conditions of the masses, the state run by a right-wing party supported by its own bigoted supporters decides to spend its energy on cultural and sentimental matters, then creating general conditions for capitalist accumulation may be compromised. In India, the state under a right-wing fascistic party is indeed often more concerned about promoting the religious nationalist agenda than creating general conditions for capitalist development. Such an agenda involves strategies and interventions that are more or less useless from the standpoint of the common affairs of the capitalist class. Seventhly, the ultimate limit is the tendency for the rate of profit to fall as the organic composition of capital rises. As there is less surplus value to play with, the state’s ability to intervene (including on behalf of labour) is diminished. The recurrent economic crisis, over which the state has little control, causes unemployment. And ‘[g]rowing unemployment, in its turn, deepens the financial crisis of the state and undermines the unstable monetary systems’ (Trotsky, 1938a). 5 Summary, and theoretical and political implications It is partly because of the capitalist structure that capitalists need to exercise their agency by making use of instrumentalist connection to state actors: the structural imperative on the state to do certain things has no guarantee that a given policy will be adequate and will always happen on time. Capitalists have their associations and organizations (including chambers of commerce, bourgeois parties, and so on) through which their class agency is exercised and through which they launch class struggle (blocking pro-people measures and repressing people’s struggles). Panitch and Gindin (2015: 9) say that capitalist institutions ‘like employers’ associations, confederations of industry, chambers of commerce, think tanks, consultancies, law firms, foundations and philanthropies mediate and fashion ‘capital’s collective class interests’. Of course, the state itself is the most trustworthy organization of the capitalist class (if not a specific regional or social fraction of the class). Instrumentalism is an important mechanism, in other words. It is also the capitalist structure that leaves a space for the autonomy of the state as a structure, and its autonomy is enjoyed by state actors. Their autonomy is a double-edged sword. It allows the state (actors) to manage the common affairs of the various fractions of the capitalist class (apart from the interests of society as a whole), and yet state actors can pursue their own interests. Views of state actors, including how they see accumulation in relation to the ‘national interest’, are important. Their own interests in accumulation of power and wealth (and their own interests may not always coincide with those of capitalist class as a whole) might influence how (well) the state promotes capitalist economic interests. The struggles of the masses have an impact on the thinking and interventions of the state as well: sometimes the state might grant concessions, and at other times, it might not. Some state actors, like some capitalists, can be compassionate and philanthropic, but qua state actors, they cannot do much. State actors may not always succeed in ensuring conditions for capitalist profit-making, and not every state action is pro-capitalist, but that does not mean that the state is not inherently capitalist. Just because a piece of art produced by a poor artist living in a remote village may be sold for a million, that does not invalidate the law of value.”翻译为中文","completion":"当然，我会争论，国家对资本阶级的财政依赖是衍生性的和情景性的。机构的分离——即国家从以利润为导向的市场经济中分离出来（即国家机构不是大公司的总部）——并不意味着国家与私营部门之间在过程上的分离。国家做或不做的事情，无论是出于整个国家的利益（在经济增长惠及资本家和工人的程度上）还是出于大众的利益，都是由国家的阶级性质根本驱动的——也就是说，它需要支持剥削阶级的经济和政治利益——而不主要是因为它自己对资本家的依赖。这种依赖确实存在。它存在于更具体的层面上。并且对资本家和非资本家阶级确实有重要影响。 4 支持资本主义利益的国家功能的局限性 通过连接到M-C-M'循环的每个步骤，如我们在第7章中看到的那样，国家可以为资本主义发展创造一般条件。相反，其行动，无论是否有意，都可以阻碍资本主义下生产力的发展。“国家权力能够......与资本主义发展合作。”16 或者它可以“给它制动”（托洛茨基，1991：212）。 虽然国家以各种方式促进资本主义积累，但就国家成功和能够成功的程度而言存在局限性。这些局限性存在于为资本主义积累创造条件的具体机制中。这是由于各种原因。 首先，由于国家对资本主义阶级的生存（税收依赖性）有衍生性依赖，国家在任何给定的时间点上手中有限的资源，这限制了国家行为者可以为资本家（和他们自己的利益）做的事情。国家可以帮助资本家——例如，它可以帮助其管辖范围内相对较弱的企业缩小自身价值与社会价值之间的差距——但任何给定国家做这些事情的能力都存在强烈的限制，因为国家受到全球范围内运作的价值规律的支配，这一规律最终决定了将有多少价值（或者，金钱）通过国家。 其次，由于国家与生产领域“分离”，它只对积累危机作出反应。17 此外，特定政策可能对资本主义积累不足(Jessop, 2012: 340; Jessop, 2006: 418)，因为在结构性限制内（例如保护财产权、商品关系等限制），\\"总会有不止一种可能的‘积累策略’\\"(Jessop, 1990: 159)。不同的资本家可能有不同的利益和对他们利益的不同看法，他们可能相互矛盾。积累策略必须推进不同资本部分（位于不同领域）的即时利益，并且必须确保至少霸权部分的长期利益，这反过来必须牺牲一些短期经济利益。在不同资本部分有不同利益，资本家和工人处于对立关系的情况下弄清楚这些将是什么并不容易。没有一个资本部分确切地知道整体经济层面需要什么政策，特别是如果经济持续易于危机。试错法是得出特定亲商政策的方法之一。但官僚国家并不总是装备得当，以创新的方式思考所需的新行动，它最擅长遵循固定的法律结构来处理某些输入(Offe, 1984)。 第三，给定的干预可能是矛盾的：一个行动的某些积极影响可能被其负面影响抵消。有些人认为军事支出对资本主义积累有好处。卢森堡（1913）说：军国主义是“实现剩余价值的一个杰出手段；它本身就是积累的一个省份”。对于哈维（2008b)来说，战争的重要性在于价值被摧毁，为生产新价值创造了机会。从阶级分割的角度看（从某些资本家的立场来看），这可能听起来合理：军国主义对资本主义积累的有利影响“是从个别资本的立场看时的情况，因为军事供应一直是迅速致富的机会”（格罗斯曼，1929）。但从整体资本的立场来看，“军国主义是非生产性消费的领域”，意味着“价值不是被保存，而是被粉碎”。这意味着“军国主义远非是积累的领域，它减缓了积累”的速度，因为“工人阶级的主要收入部分”（国家通过间接税收获得，而“本可以进入资本家手中成为剩余价值的部分被国家没收并主要用于非生产性目的”（同上）。 类似地，如果国家减少/取消对失业者的支持（失业保险），它可能会减少其支出，让总是支持紧缩政策的资本家感到高兴，同时通过削弱工人的议价能力降低工资，但没有国家支持，失业者可能无法在资本家需要利用他们的地方可用。后备军必须在场。再举一个例子，如果国家更多地支持资本投资，对资本是有利的，但增加的国家借贷可能会提高利率，这对资本（不仅仅是资本）产生不利影响（Resnick 和 Wolff, 2006: 319）。 第四，对国家的更加强烈的需求可能会威胁到国家的过度负担。国家的政策可能会对资本主义交换关系的支配地位构成威胁。国家在经济中的参与越多，某些资本部分的投资机会就越少，它吸收的社会剩余产品的比例就越大，这些本可以掌握在资本家阶级手中。18 虽然经济目的——维持资本主义经济发展的条件——是国家的主要动机，但国家确实从事各种非经济活动，这些活动可能会破坏资本主义发展的条件。 第五，资本主义国家不能仅仅关注给资本主义阶级带来好处。一个霸权阶级必须确保有一个空间，国家在其中满足非资本主义阶级和阶级部分的利益，包括大地主，以及国家行动者的高层。要成为资本主义国家，国家不必专门关注资本主义阶级。实际上，国家必须与所有阶级，整个资本主义阶级社会建立关系。国家不时以有限的方式满足非资本主义阶级的需求；它必须满足所有阶级的共同社会生态需求（婚姻法律、红绿灯、大流行、全球变暖），即使满足共同需求的方式受到其资本主义性质的影响。在资本主义阶级的利益与工人（以及小规模生产者）的利益根本不相容的程度上，国家必须满足非资本主义阶级需求的事实限制了国家在某个时间点能够满足资本主义阶级需求的程度，即使福利政策为资本家创造了市场。毕竟，每一次从剩余价值中扣除的不流向资本家阶级的部分，在其他条件不变的情况下，都被认为是对那个阶级的损失。 第六，资本主义阶级需要赚钱，为此需要创造某些文化政治条件，这些条件可能不一定直接有利于盈利。如果为了转移公众对资本家及其国家改善大众工作和生活条件失败的注意力，由一个右翼政党管理的国家得到其偏执支持者的支持，决定将精力花在文化和情感问题上，那么为资本主义积累创造一般条件可能会受到损害。在印度，一个右翼法西斯主义政党领导下的国家确实通常更关心推广宗教民族主义议程，而不是为资本主义发展创造一般条件。这样的议程涉及的策略和干预措施，从资本主义阶级的共同事务的角度看，或多或少是无用的。 第七，最终的限制是随着资本有机构成的上升，利润率倾向于下降。由于可支配的剩余价值较少，国家的干预能力（包括代表劳动力的干预）减弱。反复出现的经济危机，国家几乎无法控制，导致失业。并且“增加的失业，反过来，加深了国家的财政危机并破坏了不稳定的货币体系”（托洛茨基，1938a）。 5 摘要，以及理论和政治含义 部分原因在于资本主义结构，资本家需要通过与国家行动者的工具性联系行使他们的能动性：国家做某些事情的结构性命令没有保证，一个给定的政策将是充分的并且总是及时发生。资本家通过其协会和组织（包括商会、资产阶级政党等）行使其阶级能动性，并通过这些途径发起阶级斗争（阻挠亲民众措施和压制人民斗争）。潘尼奇和金丁（2015：9）说，资本家机构“像雇主协会、行业联合会、商会、智库、咨询公司、律师事务所、基金会和慈善机构调解并塑造‘资本的集体阶级利益’”。当然，国家本身是资本家阶级最值得信赖的组织（如果不是特定地区或社会部分的阶级）。换句话说，工具主义是一个重要机制。 也是资本主义结构为国家作为一个结构的自主性留出了空间，国家行动者享受着这种自主性。他们的自主性是一把双刃剑。它允许国家（行动者）管理资本主义阶级各个部分的共同事务（除了整个社会的利益），但国家行动者可以追求自己的利益。 国家行动者的观点，包括他们如何看待积累与“国家利益”的关系，是重要的。他们在权力和财富积累方面的自身利益（他们的利益并不总是与整个资本主义阶级的利益一致）可能会影响国家促进资本主义经济利益的方式（以及效果）。大众的斗争也会对国家的思考和干预产生影响：有时国家可能会给予让步，有时则不会。有些国家行动者，就像一些资本家一样，可能是富有同情心和慈善心的，但作为国家行动者，他们无法做太多。国家行动者可能不总是成功确保资本主义盈利条件，也并非每一项国家行动都是亲资本主义的，但这并不意味着国家本质上不是资本主义的。仅仅因为一个生活在偏远山村的贫穷艺术家创作的艺术品可能以百万的价格出售，并不使价值规律无效。"},{"prompt":"请将“On the one hand, it is mistaken to think that the close relation between state actors and capitalists makes little difference to the state’s functioning. On the other hand, such close relation is not the essence of the state as a structure. There has to be the state in the first place for the capitalists to make use of it by cultivating close relations with those who manage the affairs of the state. Given the capitalist structure, the state structure has to perform certain functions. That is true at a relatively abstract level. At a concrete level, however, personal and institutional ties between capitalists and state actors are a reality, as are the autonomous actions of state actors in their own interests. From their own experience, masses are aware of the ‘thousands of threads’ that connect capitalists to the state. The facts that there are close relations between state actors and capitalists and that top state actors and capitalists may have similar standard of living lead some to think that they are the same, or they belong to, one class. For example, Davidson (2016: 213) says that state managers’ incomes, that are ‘paid from state revenues ultimately derive from the total surplus value produced by the working class, as do the profits, interest, and rent received by different types of private capitalist’. The fact that capitalists’ profit as well as ‘the relatively high levels of remuneration, security, and prestige enjoyed by these officials depend on the continued exploitation of wage labor’ means that ‘the interests of state managers and capitalists are the same’ (ibid.). At the most fundamental level, the common interest between capitalists and state managers stems from their common class position. Both are part of the bourgeoisie: ‘departmental permanent secretaries in the British home civil service as much as, say, the chief executive officers of major companies. (Davidson, 2016: 212; italics added) Davidson invites us to ‘visualise the bourgeoisie as a series of concentric circles’ where ‘the capitalist class as such (actual owners and controllers of capital) occupies the centre and a series of other layers radiates outwards’ (p. 213). He says the groups that are ‘closer to the periphery’ are ‘progressively less directly connected to the core capitalist economic activities of production, and so on, and are more involved in the ‘ideological, administrative, or technical’ tasks that are, however, ‘essential to the reproduction of capitalism’ (p. 213). This view, although it sounds super-radical, is dangerously close to a power view of society, where capital is one form of power and the state is another form of power, even if both are said to be closely connected. Chris Harman (1991) also has a similar view: [S]tate revenues are comparable to the other revenues that accrue to different sections of capital . . . Just as there is continual conflict between the different sections of capital over the sizes of these different revenues, so there is continual conflict between the state bureaucracy and the rest of the capitalist class over the size of its cut from the total surplus value. (italics added) Even in non-economic terms, ‘the interests of state managers and capitalists are not dissimilar’, and this is because ‘[a] shared background in institutions like schools, universities, and clubs helps to consolidate a class consciousness that articulates . . . [the] interests in both groups’ (Davidson, 2016: 213). Here the assumption is that ideological position of a group of people determines their class position. Similarly, arguing for ‘a certain flexibility in drawing and redrawing class lines’, and ‘in order to capture the distinctive character ofJapanese capitalism’, Ollman (2003: 199) has found it ‘necessary to extend the notion of capitalist class to include the higher state bureaucrats and the leading politicians in the ruling party’ (p. 199). In Japan: some capitalists work in what are formally state institutions and others in what are formally private ones, though . . . most of the leading members of this class divide their lives between the two. The essential thing is that they all function as embodiments of capital, serving its (and, consequently, their own) best interests in whatever way their current positions allow. They all work to expand surplus-value and benefit materially when that happens, though when they are bureaucrats and politicians this is not immediately apparent. (Ollman, 2003: 199) [T]he process of becoming a capitalist for most of the leading members of that class begins with their entry into the state bureaucracy. Recognizing that Japan’s top bureaucrats belong to the capitalist class does not mean that we can no longer distinguish them as that part of the class that functions (at present) in the state bureaucracy. (ibid.)19 Ollman says that there is the need for a new ‘category for the peculiar case of Japan. That category is “collective capitalist”. . . . It is the collective capitalist, which divides its time between bureaucratic, business, and governmental functions’ (p. 200). The mistaken parallel being drawn here between capitalists and powerful pro-capitalist officials qua officials is based on a subjective definition of capital divorced from its underlying objective trait. Capitalists are capitalists because of an objective relationship and not merely because they wish to make money. The bureaucracy can indeed play a very active and independent role promoting capitalist interests, but there has to be a state in the first place for there to be a state bureaucracy, and the state is there because there are opposed classes, and bureaucracy qua bureaucracy is not one of them. It would be a mistake to conflate capitalists with pro-capitalist state actors as state actors, just as it is a mistake to treat the bureaucracy of a post-revolution transitional society as a capitalist class. Capitalists are those who command a huge amount of exchange value, control over private property and production, and who appropriate surplus value, and in whose interests the coercive powers of the state are primarily used. Workers lack these traits. It is the class relation and it is capitalism as class relation that explain the nature of the capitalist state as a structure of relations. And the nature of the state as a structure of relations explains the action of state actors, those who manage the affairs of the state in the common interests of the capitalist class (and large-scale landowners). Trotsky (1933) says: The class has . . . a scientifically restricted meaning to a Marxist. A class is defined not by its participation in the distribution of the national income alone, but by its independent role in the general structure of economy and by its independent roots in the economic foundations of society. ‘The bureaucracy lacks all these social traits’ of a class (ibid.). ‘It has no independent position in the process of production and distribution. It has no independent property roots. Its functions relate basically to the political technique of class rule’, and it ‘derives its privileges not from any special property relations, peculiar to it as a “class”’ (ibid.). Of course, bureaucracy can be exploitative. But ‘insofar as the bureaucracy robs the people. . . , we have to deal not with class exploitation, in the scientific sense of the word, but with social parasitism, although on a very large scale’ (ibid.). It is similar to the present-day clergy: During the middle ages the clergy constituted a class or an estate, insofar as its rule depended upon a specific system of land property and forced labor. The present day church constitutes not an exploiting class but a parasitic corporation. It would be silly to actually speak of the American clergy as a special ruling class; yet, it is indubitable that the priests of the different colors and denominations devour in the United States a big portion of the surplus value. In its traits of parasitism, the bureaucracy, as well as the clergy, approximates to the lumpen-proletariat, which likewise does not represent, as is well known, an independent ‘class’. (ibid.) Given the active role of bureaucrats in relation to capitalist development, it is indeed easy to think that they are almost like capitalist property owners or that they belong to the same class as capitalist property owners rather than the ones who make sure that capitalists continue to have their property and augment it. Marx and Engels (1845) say that ‘since the bourgeois have organised the defence of their own property in the state’, it is easy to believe that ‘the state has the factory as property, the manufacturer holds it only in fee, as possession’. They mockingly retort: In exactly the same way when a dog guards my house it ‘has’ the house ‘as property’, and I hold it only ‘in fee, as possession’ from the dog. 9 The state and the agency of the working class Karl Marx (1887: 316) asks in Capital volume 1: ‘What could possibly show better the character of the capitalist mode of production, than the necessity that exists for forcing upon it, by Acts of Parliament’, the simplest of measures in the interest of workers such as the ‘appliances for maintaining cleanliness and health’? Marx gives many reasons for these measures. One is that capital needs men and women with the suitable physical and mental abilities to work and to produce surplus value, so the state steps in to ensure this. If this is the case, then why is it that so many people live with their very basic needs, including for food and healthcare, remaining unmet? To what extent can the state actually meet people’s needs? Is capital’s need a sufficient reason for state’s pro-worker measures when these occur? What role does the working class play? In this chapter, the focus is on how the state functions to ‘help’ the working class in part as a response to the working-class politics. Partly by building on the arguments about the state’s role concerning com-modity and property relations in Chapters 4—5, I discuss, in Section 1, the state’s pro-worker interventions and the labour circuit. In Section 2, I turn to the driving forces behind the state’s pro-worker measures. I argue that there is an objective pressure on the state (e.g. general and long-term interests of capital) to intervene on behalf of workers and that this pressure is mediated by working-class struggle. In Section 3, I discuss the limits to what the state can do for workers under capitalism, the limits that exist because of the capitalist control over property and production, nature of capitalist accumulation and its crisis-proneness, and the capitalist state’s bureaucratic functioning and its antiworker politics. In Section 4, I offer general theoretical reflections on the ways in which the state is connected to working-class interests and struggle. Section 5 discusses the practical implications of the ideas discussed in the chapter.”翻译为中文","completion":"一方面，认为国家行为者与资本家之间的密切关系对国家的功能影响不大是错误的。另一方面，这种密切关系并不是国家作为结构的本质。首先必须有国家，以便资本家通过与管理国家事务的人建立密切关系来利用它。鉴于资本主义结构，国家结构必须执行某些功能。这在相对抽象的层面上是正确的。然而，在具体层面上，资本家与国家行为者之间的个人和机构联系是现实，国家行为者为了自己的利益而采取的自主行动也是如此。根据他们自己的经验，大众意识到连接资本家与国家的“成千上万的纽带”。 资本家与国家行为者之间存在密切关系以及顶级国家行为者和资本家可能有相似的生活标准，这使一些人认为他们是同一阶级，或者他们属于一个阶级。例如，戴维森（2016: 213）说，国家管理者的收入，“最终源自工人阶级产生的总剩余价值，就像不同类型的私人资本家所获得的利润、利息和租金一样”。资本家的利润以及“这些官员所享受的相对较高水平的报酬、安全性和声望依赖于继续剥削雇佣劳动”这一事实意味着“国家管理者和资本家的利益是相同的”（同上）。 在最根本的层面上，资本家和国家管理者之间的共同利益源于他们的共同阶级地位。他们都是资产阶级的一部分：“就像英国本土公务员系统中的部门常任秘书，和主要公司的首席执行官一样。 （戴维森，2016: 212；加了斜体） 戴维森邀请我们“将资产阶级想象为一系列同心圆”，其中“资本家阶级本身（实际的所有者和资本控制者）占据中心，其他一系列层次向外辐射”（第213页）。他说，“靠近边缘”的群体“与核心资本主义经济活动（生产等）的直接联系逐渐减少”，并且更多地涉及“意识形态、行政或技术”任务，但这些任务“对于资本主义的再生产来说，然而是必要的”（第213页）。这种观点，尽管听起来超级激进，却危险地接近一种权力观社会，其中资本是一种权力形式，国家是另一种权力形式，即使两者被说成是紧密相连的。 克里斯·哈曼（1991）也有类似的观点： [国家收入]可与流向不同资本部分的其他收入相比较......就像不同资本部分之间因这些不同收入的大小而持续冲突一样，国家官僚和其他资本主义阶级之间也因其从总剩余价值中分得的份额大小而持续冲突。 （加了斜体） 即使在非经济方面，“国家管理者和资本家的利益并无不同”，这是因为“在学校、大学和俱乐部等机构中的共同背景有助于巩固表达……[这两个群体]利益的阶级意识”（戴维森，2016: 213）。这里的假设是，一群人的意识形态位置决定了他们的阶级地位。 类似地，为了“在划分和重新划分阶级线条方面提供一定的灵活性”，并且“为了捕捉日本资本主义的独特性”，奥尔曼（2003: 199）发现“将资本主义阶级的概念扩展到包括高级国家官僚和执政党的主要政治家是必要的”（第199页）。在日本： 一些资本家在形式上是国家机构工作，另一些在形式上是私有机构工作，尽管......大多数这个阶级的主要成员在两者之间分配他们的生活。重要的是，他们都作为资本的化身，以其当前职位允许的任何方式服务其（因此，他们自己）的最佳利益。他们都致力于扩大剩余价值，并在这种情况下受益，尽管当他们是官僚和政治家时这不是立即显而易见的。 （奥尔曼，2003: 199） [对于大多数主要成员而言，成为一个资本家的过程是从进入国家官僚机构开始的。认识到日本的高级官僚属于资本家阶级，并不意味着我们不能再将他们区分为目前在国家官僚机构中工作的那部分阶级。 （同上）]19 奥尔曼说，有必要为日本的特殊情况建立一个新的“类别。那个类别是‘集体资本家’......正是集体资本家，在官僚、商业和政府职能之间分配他们的时间”（第200页）。 这里绘制的错误类比是基于一个脱离其基本客观特征的资本的主观定义，在资本家和有力的亲资本主义官员之间。资本家之所以是资本家，是因为一种客观关系，而不仅仅是因为他们希望赚钱。官僚机构确实可以非常积极和独立地促进资本家利益，但首先必须有一个国家才有国家官僚机构，而国家的存在是因为有对立的阶级，而官僚机构本身并不是其中之一。将资本家与亲资本主义国家行为者混为一谈是一个错误，就像将后革命过渡社会的官僚机构视为资本主义阶级一样错误。 资本家是指那些掌握大量交换价值、对私有财产和生产的控制权，并且挪用剩余价值，以及国家的强制力量主要用于其利益的人。工人缺乏这些特征。这是阶级关系，正是作为阶级关系的资本主义解释了资本主义国家作为一种关系结构的本质。而国家作为一种关系结构的本质解释了国家行为者的行动，那些管理国家事务的人代表资本家阶级（和大规模地主）的共同利益行事。托洛茨基（1933）说： 对于马克思主义者来说，阶级......有一个科学上的限定意义。阶级的定义不仅仅是通过其在国民收入分配中的参与，而是通过其在经济总体结构中的独立角色以及其在社会经济基础中的独立根源来定义的。 “官僚机构缺乏阶级的所有这些社会特征”（同上）。 “它在生产和分配过程中没有独立地位。它没有独立的财产根基。其功能主要与阶级统治的政治技术有关”，它“从任何作为‘阶级’特有的特殊财产关系中获得其特权”（同上）。当然，官僚机构可以是剥削性的。但“就官僚机构掠夺人民而言……我们处理的不是科学意义上的阶级剥削，而是社会寄生，尽管规模非常大”（同上）。这与当今的神职人员相似： 在中世纪，神职人员构成了一个阶级或一个阶层，因为其统治依赖于特定的土地财产制度和强迫劳动。当今教会不构成一个剥削阶级，而是一个寄生性团体。实际上将美国的神职人员称为一个特殊的统治阶级是愚蠢的；然而，毫无疑问，不同颜色和宗派的牧师在美国消耗了大量的剩余价值。在寄生性上，官僚机构和神职人员与流氓无产者相似，后者众所周知，同样不代表一个独立的‘阶级’。 （同上） 鉴于官僚在与资本主义发展相关的积极角色，的确很容易认为他们几乎像资本家财产所有者，或者他们属于与资本家财产所有者相同的阶级，而不是确保资本家继续拥有并增加他们的财产的那些人。马克思和恩格斯（1845）说，既然“资产阶级已经在国家中组织了保卫自己财产的防御”，很容易相信“国家拥有工厂作为财产，制造商只是作为占有物持有它”。他们嘲讽地反驳： 就像当一只狗守卫我的房子时，它‘拥有’房子‘作为财产’，我只是从狗那里‘作为占有物持有’房子一样。 9 国家与工人阶级的能动性 卡尔·马克思（1887：316）在《资本论》第一卷中问道：“有什么能比通过议会法案强加于它的最简单的措施——例如为维持清洁和健康的设施——更能表明资本主义生产方式的特征呢？”马克思给出了许多原因。 其中一个原因是，资本需要具有适当的身体和心理能力的男人和女人来工作并产生剩余价值，所以国家介入以确保这一点。如果是这样，为什么还有这么多人的基本需求，包括食物和医疗保健，仍然得不到满足呢？国家实际上能在多大程度上满足人们的需求？当这些发生时，资本的需求是否足以成为国家亲工人措施的充分理由？工人阶级扮演什么角色？本章重点是国家如何部分作为对工人阶级政治的回应来“帮助”工人阶级。 部分基于第4-5章关于国家关于商品和财产关系角色的论证，我在第1节中讨论了国家亲工人的干预和劳动循环。在第2节，我转向国家亲工人措施背后的驱动力。我认为国家存在客观压力（例如，资本的一般和长期利益）代表工人干预，这种压力通过工人阶级斗争得到调解。在第3节，我讨论了国家在资本主义下能为工人做什么的局限性，这些局限性存在于资本家对财产和生产的控制、资本主义积累及其危机倾向性、资本主义国家的官僚机构运作及其反工人政治的性质。在第4节中，我就国家与工人阶级利益和斗争的联系方式提供了一般理论反思。第5节讨论了本章讨论的观点的实践含义。"},{"prompt":"请将“1 State’s pro-worker interventions and the labour circuit (C-M-C'-R-C) As suggested in Chapter 4, the state connects to each phase of what I have called the labour circuit (C-M-C'-R-C). The state is, to some extent, involved in the determination of the value of the commodity labour power (C). It influences whether, how and to what extent labour power can be sold through its policies concerning, for example, the rate of employment and the freedom of labour in the labour market. It is involved in the determination of the monetary value of labour power, or wage (M), via the minimum wage policy, and it also supplements the private wage with a social wage. The state influences how much food and other things (C') people can buy with the money wage that they receive, because the state has an impact on inflation through its monetary policy. It also has an impact on the sphere of reproduction (R) through its policies concerning, say childcare or family relations, which contribute to the (re)production of the commodity labour power (C). The concept of the labour circuit can now be expanded in order to shed light on state’s pro-worker interventions, particularly, in the labour-market and the workplace. I will also briefly discuss state’s policies in favour of small-scale producers. The state fixes ‘[Reasonable wages’ and ‘the limits of the working-day’ (Marx, 1887: 182) apart from various other measures. The minimum wage legislation, if properly implemented, can benefit workers who receive very low wages.1 If the mandated minimum wage is significantly above the market rate in many sectors, the minimum wage legislation could have a positive impact on the determination of the value of labour power as it puts a floor on the wage level and indeed on the actual wages paid. A lower minimum wage would have the opposite effect. In part because workers do not receive the cost of production of labour power from private employers, millions are in poverty who receive some state assistance (e.g. subsidized food), which really amounts to subsidizing capitalist companies who fail to ensure the reproduction of their workforce. The state constructs the poverty line to target welfare provision to the population below the poverty line. The poverty line represents state’s perception of what people absolutely need to live, a perception that is determined by capitalists’ interests. The state’s poverty line, like the state-defined minimum wage, will have an impact on the value of labour power and on its monetary expression. A higher poverty line, if implemented, will put pressure on the buyers of labour power to pay higher wages. This will reduce the extent of the violation of the principle of ‘exchange equivalent for equivalent’ (Marx, 1887: 123). During the infancy of capitalism, the state makes workers work long hours or supports capitalists making workers work long hours. As capitalism progresses, the state limits the working day (especially when technical change allows employers to extra more labour every hour): ‘The legal limitation of the working-day puts an end to such mischief’ (Marx, 1887: 385).2 Indeed, Factory Acts came into force both in advanced countries and in the periphery.3 There has been a need for the state to make unfree labour illegal, including by acting against regulations characteristic of pre-capitalist societies. State inter-vention has included laws against bonded labour, and laws that restrict child labour, and prohibits child labour below certain age.4 The fact that millions of people, including children, work as forced labour means that the state has not succeeded, thanks to the power of the capitalist buyers of the labour power. The state may ‘make elementary education a compulsory condition to the “productive” employment of children’ (Marx, 1887: 274) under a certain age.5 The state sometimes provides small loans or subsidized necessaries to workers and small-scale producers, but this intervention is inadequate. The state has policies against adulterated food.6 Through its land reforms programme, the state may also weaken the power of rent-receiving landlords because of whom the ground rent exists which in turn directly or indirectly affects the economic conditions (e.g. cost of food) of the workers and small-scale producers. In addition, the state in some countries has ‘tried to’ guarantee that the produce of farmers will be bought at a minimum support price by the government, thus protecting them against the uncertainties in the market demand and market price. The state seeks to feed the reserve army in situ, including the technologically induced floating population,7 sometimes by helping people set up micro-enterprises, thus ensuring that the unemployed stay where they are just in case they are needed by the big business. It also invests in public works to create some employment and provides tax breaks to companies to attract them to create jobs in poverty-stricken areas (e.g. opportunity zones policy in the US discussed earlier). All in all, some of the state’s interventions aim to ‘protect the workers’ and can be ‘against the interests of the employers’. There is no doubt that the workers, especially in advanced countries, have enjoyed some benefits from these policies. These legislations tend to weaken some of the worse abuses (or excesses).8 In the sectors and areas/countries that are not regulated, works suffer more, and this suggests that state regulation has made some difference. The working class of the world as a whole is more educated and healthier, and it lives longer now than it did 300 years ago. Of course, there is enormous geographical variation across jurisdictions of nation-states and between socially privileged and socially under-privileged groups inside a country (e.g. African-Americans in the US, ex-untouchables in India, indigenous peoples in Canada). State intervention in favour of non-capitalist groups — the working-class people (both the employed and under/un-employed) and small-scale producers — can be of different types. One can think about state policies along two dimensions: (a) whether the intervention is primarily at the level of circulation (market-based) or production and (b) whether the intervention is commodified or de-commodified (Wright, 1985: 298). Taking these two dimensions together, we can produce the following four-fold typology of state interventions (as shown in Table 9.1) (ibid.). To illustrate the differences between these types, state interventions to deal with the problem of malnutrition or food insecurity could be used as an example (Wright, 1985: 299). Food stamps would be a commodified-circulation intervention (CC): the state simply redistributes a targeted income to certain groups to be spent in the open market for the acquisition of food. Free distribution of surplus food to the poor would be a de-commodified-circulation intervention (DC). Government subsidies to farmers to encourage them to produce certain food products for poor people which otherwise might not be profitable to produce would be a commodified production intervention (CP). The minimum support price policy falls in this category too. State-run farms to produce food for the poor would be a de-commodified production intervention (DP). 2 Driving forces behind state action in favour of workers (and small-scale producers) The question is this: why does the state, the state of capitalists (and large-scale landowners), intervene on behalf of the masses? The answer must be from multiple vantage points, including working-class revolt and the capitalist class society (general, long-term) interests of the capitalist as a whole and various capitalist groups. Also, in thinking about the state, a distinction has to be made between pretext for state action and its cause. A state action in the interest of workers and small-scale producers tends to find its immediate pretext (not its cause) in such things as a society-wide health crisis (e.g. pandemic) that decimates the people making it difficult for capitalists to have access to enough workers at reasonable wages.9 Class struggle Given the immanent potential for class conflict within the exploitative capitalist system, the capitalist state granting material concessions is an attempt to produce common people’s consent to the system and to subdue the intensity of actual class struggle as well as pre-empt future class struggle. State interventions in relation to working conditions — for example, Parliamentary Acts — are partly a result of class struggle between the two main classes and not ‘the products of Parliamentary fancy’ (Marx, 1887: 187). ‘Their formulation, official recognition, and proclamation by the State, were the result of a long struggle of classes’ (ibid.). Clearly, ‘[t]he history of this struggle shows two opposed tendencies’ (Marx, 1887: 181). This is in the sense that, for example, during the earliest stage in capitalism’s history, and with respect to the working-day, the statutes of the state ‘tried to lengthen it by compulsion’, ‘[w]hilst the modern Factory Acts compulsorily shortened the working-day’ (ibid.). Indeed, ‘in its adult condition’, with workers’ organization getting stronger, they have received ‘the concessions that, growling and struggling, it [i.e. capital] has to make’ (ibid.; italics added). Indeed, acting in its own collective interest, the working class has demanded such things as the reduction in the working day: ‘The establishment of a normal working-day is the result of centuries of struggle between capitalist and labourer’ (ibid.: 181).10 Of course, while class struggle contributes to the introduction of pro-worker measures at sub-national and national scales, the nature and the impacts of the legislations can vary geographically. There were important differences between the measures taken by the French state and those by the English state, for example.11 The laws of commodity exchange impose no limit to how much capitalists exploit workers, and because of the same laws, the state can do little except under ‘compulsion from society’ (Marx, 1887: 181). This compulsion is in the form of labour struggle: ‘[I]n the history of capitalist production, the determination of what is a working day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital, i.e., the class of capitalists, and collective labour, i.e., the working-class’ (Marx, 1887: 164). In fact, both wages and the working day are a function of the relative balance of power. Marx (1865) writes in Value, price and profit that the upper limit to profit is ‘limited by the physical minimum of wages and the physical maximum of the working day’ and that, therefore, how much profit capitalists make ‘is only settled by the continuous struggle between capital and labour, the capitalist constantly tending to reduce wages to their physical minimum, and to extend the working day to its physical maximum, while the working man constantly presses in the opposite direction. ‘The matter resolves itself into a question of the respective powers of the combatants,’ Marx says.”翻译为中文","completion":"1 国家亲工人干预和劳动循环（C-M-C'-R-C） 如第4章所述，国家与我所称的劳动循环（C-M-C'-R-C）的每个阶段相连。国家在一定程度上参与决定商品劳动力（C）的价值。它通过其政策影响劳动力是否、如何以及在多大程度上可以出售，例如，关于就业率和劳动力市场的自由。它参与决定劳动力的货币价值或工资（M），通过最低工资政策，并且还通过社会工资补充私人工资。国家影响人们能用他们收到的货币工资购买多少食物和其他东西（C'），因为国家通过其货币政策对通胀产生影响。它还通过其关于例如儿童保育或家庭关系的政策影响再生产领域（R），这些政策有助于商品劳动力（C）的（再）生产。劳动循环的概念现在可以扩展，以阐明国家亲工人干预，特别是在劳动力市场和工作场所。我还将简要讨论国家支持小规模生产者的政策。 国家确定“[合理工资”和“工作日的限制”（马克思，1887年：182页）以及各种其他措施。如果得到适当实施，最低工资立法可以惠及收入非常低的工人。1 如果规定的最低工资在许多行业显著高于市场率，最低工资立法可能对劳动力价值的决定产生积极影响，因为它为工资水平乃至实际支付的工资设定了底线。最低工资较低将产生相反效果。 部分原因是工人没有从私人雇主那里获得劳动力生产成本，数以百万计的人生活在贫困中，他们得到了一些国家援助（例如，补贴食品），这实际上等于补贴了未能确保其劳动力再生产的资本主义公司。国家构建贫困线，以将福利提供目标对准贫困线以下的人口。贫困线代表国家对人们绝对需要生活的东西的看法，这一看法由资本家利益决定。国家的贫困线，像国家定义的最低工资一样，将对劳动力的价值及其货币表现产生影响。如果实施，更高的贫困线将对劳动力的购买者施压，要求支付更高的工资。这将减少“等价交换”的原则被侵犯的程度（马克思，1887：123）。 在资本主义发展的初期，国家使工人工作长时间或支持资本家使工人工作长时间。随着资本主义的发展，国家限制了工作日（特别是当技术变革允许雇主每小时提取更多劳动时）：“对工作日的法律限制结束了这种恶习”（马克思，1887：385）。2 实际上，工厂法案在发达国家和周边地区都开始实施。3 国家需要使非自由劳动非法，包括通过对抗前资本主义社会特有的规定的行动。国家干预包括针对契约劳工的法律，限制童工法律，禁止某一年龄以下的童工。4 数百万人，包括儿童，作为强迫劳动而工作，这意味着由于资本家劳动力购买者的力量，国家未能成功。国家可能“将基础教育作为儿童‘生产性’就业的强制条件”（马克思，1887：274），直到一定年龄。5 国家有时向工人和小规模生产者提供小额贷款或补贴必需品，但这种干预是不足的。国家有反对掺假食品的政策。6 通过其土地改革计划，国家还可能削弱领取地租的地主的力量，这些地主使地租存在，从而直接或间接影响工人和小规模生产者的经济条件（例如，食品成本）。此外，一些国家“试图”保证政府将以最低支持价格购买农民生产的农产品，从而保护他们免受市场需求和市场价格不确定性的影响。 国家寻求就地养活后备军，包括技术引起的流动人口，7 有时通过帮助人们建立微型企业，从而确保失业者留在原地，以防万一大企业需要他们。它还投资于公共工程以创造一些就业，并为公司提供税收减免，以吸引它们在贫困地区创造就业机会（例如，美国之前讨论的机会区政策）。 总的来说，国家的一些干预旨在“保护工人”，可能“与雇主的利益相反”。无疑，特别是在发达国家，工人从这些政策中享受到了一些好处。这些立法倾向于削弱一些更糟糕的滥用行为（或过度行为）。8 在未受监管的部门和地区/国家，工人受苦更多，这表明国家监管确实有所不同。整个世界的工人阶级现在比300年前受过更多教育，更健康，寿命更长。当然，不同国家管辖区之间以及一个国家内社会特权和社会弱势群体之间存在巨大的地理差异（例如，美国的非裔美国人，印度的前贱民，加拿大的土著人）。 国家支持非资本主义群体的干预——工人（包括受雇和失业/未就业者）和小规模生产者——可以有不同类型。可以从两个维度考虑国家政策：（a）干预主要是在流通（基于市场）还是生产层面，（b）干预是商品化还是非商品化（赖特，1985：298）。将这两个维度结合起来，我们可以得出国家干预的以下四分类型（如表9.1所示）（同上）。 以解决营养不良或食物不安全问题的国家干预为例来说明这些类型之间的差异（赖特，1985：299）。食品券将是一种商品化流通干预（CC）：国家只是将目标收入重新分配给某些群体，以便在开放市场上购买食物。向穷人免费分发剩余食物将是一种非商品化流通干预（DC）。政府补贴农民以鼓励他们生产一些可能对穷人有益但不赚钱的食物将是一种商品化生产干预（CP）。最低支持价格政策也属于此类别。国有农场为穷人生产食物将是一种非商品化生产干预（DP）。 2 支持工人（和小规模生产者）的国家行动背后的驱动力 问题是：为什么国家，资本家（和大地主）的国家，要代表大众进行干预？答案必须从多个角度出发，包括工人阶级反抗和资本主义阶级社会（一般，长期）资本家整体和各个资本家集团的利益。同时，在考虑国家时，必须区分国家行动的借口和其原因。国家对工人和小规模生产者的利益进行的行动往往在其直接借口（而不是其原因）中找到，比如社会范围的健康危机（例如，大流行）消灭了人们，使资本家难以以合理的工资获得足够的工人。9 阶级斗争 鉴于剥削性资本主义体系内固有的阶级冲突潜力，资本主义国家给予物质让步是为了获得普通人对体系的同意，并减轻实际阶级斗争的激烈程度以及预防未来的阶级斗争。与工作条件有关的国家干预——例如，议会法案——部分是两个主要阶级之间阶级斗争的结果，而不是“议会幻想的产物”（马克思，1887：187）。 “它们的制定、官方认可和国家的宣告，是长期阶级斗争的结果”（同上）。 显然，“这场斗争的历史显示了两种对立的趋势”（马克思，1887：181）。这意味着，例如，在资本主义历史的最早阶段，就工作日而言，国家的法规“试图通过强制来延长它”，“[而]现代工厂法案强制缩短了工作日”（同上）。实际上，“在成熟状态下”，随着工人组织变得更强大，他们收到了“咆哮和挣扎中必须做出的让步”（同上；加了斜体）。实际上，为了自己的集体利益，工人阶级要求诸如减少工作日之类的事情：“建立正常工作日是几个世纪以来资本家和劳工之间斗争的结果”（同上：181）。10 当然，虽然阶级斗争有助于在次国家和国家规模引入亲工人措施，但立法的性质和影响在地理上可以有所不同。例如，法国国家和英国国家采取的措施之间存在重要差异。11 商品交换法则对资本家剥削工人的程度没有限制，因为同样的法则，国家除了在“社会的强制下”外几乎无能为力（马克思，1887：181）。这种强制是以劳动斗争的形式出现的：“在资本主义生产的历史中，什么是工作日的决定，呈现为一场斗争的结果，一场集体资本，即，资本家阶级，和集体劳动，即，工人阶级之间的斗争”（马克思，1887：164）。 事实上，工资和工作日都是相对力量平衡的函数。马克思（1865）在《价值、价格和利润》中写道，利润的上限“受到工资的物理最低限度和工作日的物理最高限度的限制”，因此，资本家能赚多少利润“只能通过资本和劳动之间的持续斗争来解决，资本家不断倾向于将工资降至其物理最低限度，并将工作日延长至其物理最高限度，而工人则不断朝相反方向施压。”“这个问题归结为双方的相对力量，”马克思说。"},{"prompt":"请将“It is not just that the state grants concessions (e.g. shorter working days) because of the workers’ struggle. In fact, because of the political pressure from below, the state grants to the workers their unionization right itself, and unionization in turn puts pressure on the state (and capital): ‘only against its will and under the pressure of the masses’ did the British state (in the form of the parliament) ‘give up the laws against Strikes and Trades’ Unions, after it had itself, for 500 years, held, with shameless egoism, the position of a permanent Trades’ Union of the capitalists against the labourers’ (Marx, 1887: 525). The struggle to establish unions, and especially the unions that are independent of the enterprise management, continues as the recent history of India’s Maruti workers struggle shows (White, J., 2017). While concessions are promised and granted by the state due to reformoriented struggles, the connection between the two — concessions and struggles — is stronger, however, if/when there is a threat to capitalist property interests (a threat to public order) from people’s struggles.12 In the US context, historically, according to Piven and Cloward (1974: 147): relief arrangements are initiated or expanded during the occasional outbreaks of civil disorder produced by mass unemployment, and are then abolished or contracted when political stability is restored. . . . [E]expan- sive relief policies are designed to mute civil disorder, and restrictive ones to reinforce work norms. In other words, relief policies are cyclical-liberal or restrictive depending on the problems of regulation in the larger society with which government must contend. While the capitalists and the state do not grant anything without a struggle by the masses, it is also the case that capitalism creates conditions for class struggle. It does this by promoting transportation and communication technologies and removing geographical barriers to working-class unity through the spatial con-centration of workers in specific localities and cities, all in its own economic interest (easy access to a labour pool). Capitalism — ‘the direct and open sway of capital’ — also removes non- or pre-capitalist social relations ‘behind which the dominion of capital is still in part concealed’. With the ‘destruction of petty and domestic industries’, gone is ‘the sole remaining safety-valve of the whole social mechanism’, and this in turn ‘generalises the direct opposition’ of the masses to capital (Marx, 1887: 329). In fact, as non-capitalist ways of reproduction (e.g. family-based production, access to common property resources) vanish, workers increasingly depend on the state to meet the gap between what they need and what they receive from employers. And since the state working on behalf of capital will not give anything automatically, that is, without a struggle, people fight for concessions. Capital’s interests (coinciding with workers’ interests) There is more to the story of pro-worker measures than just working-class struggle forcing the state to intervene on behalf of labour. Behind the proworker legislations, there are often long-term capitalist interests: ‘Apart from the working-class movement that daily grew more threatening, the limiting of factory labour [by the state] was dictated by the same necessity which spread guano over the English fields.’ In other words, ‘[t]he same blind eagerness for plunder that in the one case exhausted the soil, had, in the other, torn up by the roots the living force of the nation’ (Marx, 1887: 166). Capital engages in the normal process of exploitation when workers surrender to capital a large part of the net product. And then there is excessive (= above-normal) exploitation, causing the degeneration of the working population. The excesses (abuses) inflicted on workers are a product of the mutually competing capitalists when they lower the wages below the average cost of maintenance of workers, make workers work excessively long hours of work, cut down on spending for workplace safety (e.g. protective equipment during a pandemic, enough working space per worker, safety of chemicals), and so on. ‘Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist’ (Marx, 1887: 181). These external laws of capitalist production meet with the extra-economic laws: ‘Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society’ (ibid.; italics added). This compulsion from society is represented by pro-worker state interventions against capital’s recklessness of workers’ health and well-being and against the violation of equal exchange in the labour market (p. 181). In general, the measures regulating the working conditions develop ‘gradually out of circumstances as natural laws of the modern mode of production’(Marx, 1887: 187) in the sense that excesses of capitalism (e.g. long working day, low wages) would result in a crippled reproduction of the only source of surplus value (i.e. labour). Thus, short working day is not entirely due to class struggle from below: long-term interests are important explanations, especially when ‘the living force of the nation’ (Marx, 1887: 166) is endangered including during a society-wide economic crisis and/or ecological crisis (pandemic). It is important to note that the mere fear of contagious diseases which do not spare even ‘respectability’ [that is, the bourgeoisie and well-off strata close to it] brought into existence from 1847 to 1864 no less than 10 Acts of Parliament on sanitation, and that the frightened bourgeois in some towns . . . took strenuous measures through their municipalities. (ibid.: 458) Individual capitalists are cogs in the wheel of competition. Their shortterm interests — capitalists ‘recklessness’ — directly destroy workers’ health (and they cause the destruction of the environment which in turn affects workers’ bodies/health). This fact undermines long-term interests of capitalists, thus prompting the state to intervene. The regulation of the working day is in the interest of capital and not just labour: if due to overwork and adverse working lives (and environmental pollution), people die faster, then they have to be replaced quicker (the value of labour power will thus go up), and this has a cost for the user of this labouring body, that is, the capitalist class.13 The fact that ‘the forces used up have to be replaced at a more rapid rate and the sum of the expenses for the reproduction of labour-power will be greater’ implies that ‘the interest of capital itself points in the direction of a normal working-day’ (Marx, 1887: 179). If in place of ‘the unnatural extension of the working-day’, and the like that Marx talks about, we put environmental damage, the logic mentioned earlier will still hold. Capitalist production leads to unfavourable effects which need state regulation: Factory legislation, that first conscious and methodical reaction of society against the spontaneously developed form of the process of production, is . . . just as much the necessary product of modern industry as cotton yam, self-actors, and the electric telegraph. (Marx, 1887: 315) In other words, the state is prompted by capitalists’ long-term interests to implement certain policies in favour of workers and the environment, curbing capital’s passion for profit. These policies are ultimately in favour of the capitalist class as a whole, more or less; or they are implemented in such a way that the capitalist class as a whole or some dominant sections of the class benefit from them.14 So the general interest of the capitalist class is crucial to the understanding of pro-worker state policies. The adverse conditions under which workers work and live and which cause illnesses and the crisis of bodily reproduction mean that capitalists can find it difficult to obtain enough people at a wage rate at which enough surplus value can be made (p. 181). The regulation of capitalist production is a political act on the part of capitalist society against spontaneous economic laws and shapes those economic processes. Similarly, to the extent that the state also allows, however reluctantly, a degree of trade union activity, one reason is the pressure of the masses, as mentioned before. Another reason, once again, is the self-interest of capital: trade union activity ‘has expansionary effects on the market and therefore on the profitability of business’ (Cox, 2002: 249). Besides, a slightly reconciliatory section of the bourgeoisie may use trade unions to subordinate the working class (and small-scale producers), through its collaboration with the trade union leaders, to their party and thus to the state. Indeed, it may promote unions to garner votes and thus political legitimacy for pro-capitalist actions. The current Biden-led government in the US is an example. The state looks after non-capitalist classes when their interests do not go against, or when they match with, the interests of the capitalist class or its dominant fraction. State policies aimed at providing education and healthcare as well as higher minimum wages can, apart from buying peace, create a market for the capitalist class and thus respond to temporary realization problem within specific sectors and areas. Likewise, the state assistance to farmers would also create rural purchasing power to the benefit of the capitalist class.15 The long-term interests in industrial peace and in the market clearance could partly explain why sometimes sections of the capitalist class (‘patriotic billionaires’) might actually advocate, or tolerate, ‘pro-worker’ reforms (including higher taxes on them and use of the taxes for workers’ welfare). The ruling class as a whole has certain long-term economic and political interests. Then elements within the ruling class have certain specific interests, and these can be mutually conflicting. Conflicts within the ruling class can help the lower-class struggle in certain cases.16 If a section of the capitalist class needs the support of workers in its battle with, say, landowners, capitalists may support pro-worker legislations.17 Also, inter-capitalist competition contributes to the universalization of the application of government regulations. ‘The first birthright of capital is equal exploitation of labour-power by all capitalists’ (Marx, 1887: 320). In addition, there is ‘the cry of the [bigger] capitalists for equality in the conditions of competition, i.e., for equal restrain on all exploitation of labour’ (ibid.).18 Whenever a law (e.g. a law that limits the labour of children to 6 hours) is applicable to certain enterprises and not to other enterprises, manufacturers in the first category complain against this ‘discrimination’.19 Implied here is a general point about capitalism: ‘since capital is by nature a leveller, since it exacts in every sphere of production equality in the conditions of the exploitation of labour, the limitation by law of’ such things as ‘children’s labour, in one branch of industry, becomes the cause of its limitation in others’ (Marx, 1887: 273). It is the case that ‘there are major differences and disputes’ among the different branches of the state and within each one of them. These differences, more or less, reflect the different capitalist interests as well as different perceptions by state actors of what needs to be done to maintain conditions for capitalist accumulation and for industrial peace. And, ‘subaltern classes can occasionally use this disarray to score minor victories in some of the state’s more distant outposts’ (Ollman, 2003: 203).”翻译为中文","completion":"不仅仅是因为工人的斗争，国家才做出让步（例如，缩短工作日）。实际上，由于来自下层的政治压力，国家授予工人组建工会的权利，而工会反过来对国家（和资本）施加压力：“英国国家（以议会的形式）‘放弃了针对罢工和工会的法律’，只是在大众压力下迫不得已采取的行动，而在此之前，它自己500年来一直以厚颜无耻的自私自利，扮演着永久性资本家工会对抗劳动者的角色”（马克思，1887: 525）。建立工会的斗争，尤其是独立于企业管理层的工会的斗争，仍在继续，正如印度马鲁蒂工人近期斗争的历史所示（白，J., 2017）。 尽管国家因改革导向的斗争而允诺并给予让步，但两者之间的联系——让步和斗争——如果/当资本财产利益受到人民斗争的威胁时（公共秩序的威胁），则联系更加紧密。12 在美国的历史背景下，据皮文和克劳德（1974：147）描述： 救济安排是在大规模失业引发偶尔的民间骚乱期间启动或扩大的，然后在政治稳定恢复时被废除或缩减。...扩大的救济政策旨在平息民间骚乱，而限制性政策则用来加强工作规范。换句话说，救济政策是周期性自由或限制性的，这取决于政府必须应对的更大社会中的管理问题。 尽管资本家和国家不会在没有大众斗争的情况下给予任何东西，资本主义也创造了阶级斗争的条件。它通过推广运输和通信技术以及消除对工人阶级团结的地理障碍来实现这一点，通过在特定地区和城市对工人进行空间集中，在其自身的经济利益中（轻松获取劳动力池）。资本主义——“资本的直接和公开统治”——也消除了非资本主义或前资本主义社会关系，“这些社会关系背后部分隐藏着资本的统治”。随着“小规模和家庭工业的破坏”，整个社会机制的唯一剩余的安全阀消失了，这反过来“使大众对资本的直接对立”普遍化（马克思，1887：329）。事实上，随着非资本主义生产方式（例如，基于家庭的生产，对公共财产资源的使用）的消失，工人越来越依赖国家来弥补他们从雇主那里得到的和他们需要的之间的差距。而由于代表资本运作的国家不会自动给予任何东西，即，没有斗争就没有让步，人们为了获得让步而斗争。 资本的利益（与工人的利益相一致） 亲工人措施背后的故事不仅仅是工人阶级的斗争迫使国家代表劳动力进行干预。背后的亲工人立法，往往有长期的资本家利益：“除了日益威胁的工人阶级运动之外，国家对工厂劳动的限制[由国家颁布]也是出于相同的必要性，这种必要性使得鸟粪铺满了英国的田野。”换句话说，“在一个案例中贪婪地掠夺导致土壤耗尽，在另一个案例中，根本撕裂了国家的生命力”（马克思，1887：166）。 当工人向资本投降大部分净产品时，资本进行正常的剥削过程。然后有过度（=高于正常）的剥削，导致工作人口的退化。对工人施加的过度（滥用）是相互竞争的资本家在他们将工资降低到工人维持平均成本以下、使工人过度长时间工作、削减工作场所安全支出（例如，在大流行期间的防护设备、每个工人的工作空间足够、化学品的安全性等）时产生的。“自由竞争展现了资本主义生产的固有规律，以对每个个别资本家都有权力的外部强制性法律的形式出现”（马克思，1887：181）。这些资本主义生产的外部法则与超经济法则相遇：“资本不顾劳动者的健康或寿命，除非受到社会的强制”（同上；加了斜体）。这种来自社会的强制代表了国家对资本对工人健康和福祉的漠不关心以及对劳动市场中等价交换原则的侵犯采取亲工人干预（第181页）。总的来说，监管工作条件的措施作为现代生产方式的自然规律“逐渐从情况中发展出来”（马克思，1887：187），意味着资本主义的过度（例如，长工作日，低工资）会导致唯一剩余价值来源（即劳动力）的生产受损。 因此，短工作日不完全是由于来自下层的阶级斗争：长期利益是重要的解释，尤其是当“国家的生命力”（马克思，1887：166）受到威胁时，包括在全社会范围的经济危机和/或生态危机（大流行）期间。值得注意的是， 即使“连‘体面’[即，资产阶级及其接近的富裕阶层]也不放过”的传染病的恐惧使得从1847年到1864年有不少于10项关于卫生的议会法案出台，而且在一些城镇里，受惊吓的资产阶级通过他们的市政府采取了积极措施。 （同上：458） 个别资本家是竞争之轮的齿轮。他们的短期利益——资本家的“鲁莽”——直接破坏了工人的健康（并且它们导致了环境的破坏，反过来影响工人的身体/健康）。这一事实破坏了资本家的长期利益，从而促使国家介入。工作日的规范符合资本的利益，而不仅仅是劳动的利益：如果由于过度劳动和不利的工作生活（以及环境污染），人们更快死亡，那么他们必须更快被替换（劳动力的价值将会上升），这对于使用这种劳动身体的用户，即资本家阶级来说有成本。13 事实上，“使用的力量必须以更快的速度替换，劳动力再生产的费用总额将更大”表明“资本本身的利益指向了正常工作日的方向”（马克思，1887：179）。如果我们把马克思谈到的“工作日的不自然延长”等替换为环境破坏，前面提到的逻辑仍然成立。资本主义生产导致不利的影响，需要国家的规制： 工厂法案，作为社会对生产过程自发形式的首次有意识和有条理的反应，......和棉纱、自动纺织机和电报一样，是现代工业的必然产物。 （马克思，1887：315） 换句话说，国家受资本家长期利益的驱使，实施了有利于工人和环境的某些政策，遏制资本对利润的热情。这些政策最终有利于整个资本家阶级，或多或少；或者它们以这样一种方式实施——整个资本家阶级或其一些主导部分从中受益。14 因此，资本家阶级的一般利益对理解亲工人的国家政策至关重要。工人的工作和生活条件恶劣，导致疾病和身体再生产危机，意味着资本家可能难以以足够的工资率获得足够的人，从而创造足够的剩余价值（第181页）。资本主义生产的调节是资本主义社会针对自发经济法则的政治行为，塑造那些经济过程。 同样，国家也允许一定程度的工会活动，尽管勉强，其中一个原因是前面提到的大众的压力。另一个原因，再次，是资本的自身利益：工会活动“对市场和因此对企业的盈利能力有扩张作用”（考克斯，2002：249）。此外，资产阶级中较为和解的一部分可能利用工会通过与工会领导人的合作，将工人阶级（和小规模生产者）置于它们的政党之下，从而置于国家之下。事实上，它可能促进工会以获取选票，从而为亲资本主义行动赢得政治合法性。目前的美国拜登领导的政府就是一个例子。 国家照顾非资本主义阶级的利益，当这些利益不与资本主义阶级或其主导部分的利益相冲突，或者当它们与资本家阶级的利益相匹配时。旨在提供教育和医疗保健以及更高的最低工资的国家政策，除了购买和平之外，还可以为资本家阶级创造市场，从而应对特定部门和地区内的暂时实现问题。同样，对农民的国家援助也会为资本家阶级创造农村购买力。15 工业和平和市场清除的长期利益可以部分解释为什么有时资本家阶级的某些部分（“爱国亿万富翁”）实际上可能主张或容忍“亲工人”改革（包括对他们征收更高的税，并将税收用于工人福利）。 作为一个整体的统治阶级有一定的长期经济和政治利益。然后，统治阶级内部的各个元素有特定的利益，这些利益可能相互冲突。统治阶级内部的冲突在某些情况下可以帮助下层阶级的斗争。16 如果资本家阶级的一个部分在与例如地主的斗争中需要工人的支持，资本家可能支持亲工人立法。17 此外，资本家之间的竞争有助于政府法规的普遍应用。“资本的第一个天赋权利是所有资本家对劳动力的平等剥削”（马克思，1887：320）。此外，有“[较大的]资本家呼吁竞争条件的平等，即，对所有剥削的平等限制”（同上）。18 每当一项法律（例如，将儿童劳动限制为6小时的法律）仅适用于某些企业而不适用于其他企业时，第一类别的制造商会抱怨这种“歧视”。19 这里暗示的是关于资本主义的一个普遍观点：“因为资本本质上是平等主义者，因为它在生产的每个领域都要求劳动剥削条件的平等，所以通过法律限制”诸如儿童劳动之类的事情，“在一个产业部门，成为其他部门限制的原因”（马克思，1887：273）。 事实上，“不同的国家机构之间和它们各自内部存在重大分歧和争议”。这些分歧或多或少反映了不同的资本家利益以及国家行为者对为维持资本积累条件和工业和平需要做什么的不同看法。而且，“下层阶级偶尔可以利用这种混乱，在国家的一些较远的前哨站取得小胜利”（奥尔曼，2003：203）。"},{"prompt":"请将“Apart from capital’s common and mutually conflicting interests, there is also state’s ‘own’ interest behind its pro-worker interventions. If common people live and work under adverse conditions, and if their physical fitness suffers, this is not good for the state from the standpoint of, for example, war-making (the latter, of course, is ultimately in the interest of the capitalist class as well). The capitalist state needs plenty of able-bodied people for the battlefield just as capitalist employers need them for the workplace.20 Pro-poor attitude of some state actors might also contribute to the people getting some concessions, within limits. Of course, it is a moot point whether the concessions are funded by taxes from the people (workers and small-scale producers) or from the surplus appropriated by capitalists (and large-scale landowners). 3 Limits to state’s pro-worker interventions, and why? What has been said in the last two sections should be seen in terms of a tendency: under certain conditions, the state tends to grant some concessions, but whether in fact it will and, if it will, how adequate are the concessions, are a contingent matter. In fact, what is promised in the form of pro-worker interventions is usually much bigger than what is delivered.21 There is a limit to the extent to which the state can limit the adverse impacts of capitalism on people. Pro-worker policies are in place, but they are often not fully implemented.22 That the state provides only limited benefits can be seen by looking at the social wage. The social wage, or overall net subsidy, is usually positive (but a very small positive amount) in some of the rich countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and United Kingdom),23 while it is generally negative (that is, a net tax) in the US even during the boom years, and ‘this meant that wage and salary earner paid out more in taxes than they received — they helped reduce any existing fiscal deficit’. In contrast, ‘Over the same interval in Sweden, the net social wage was roughly zero, indicating that its generous social welfare expenditures were actually self-financed’ (p. 538).24 A more recent research reached a similar conclusion: [I]n almost all advanced capitalist countries, the great bulk of [their] social spending (and especially the part which constitutes labor benefits or the gross social wage) necessarily comes from gross labor income, that is, from personal income taxes, social security contributions, and other personal and property taxes that are levied on labor. To the extent that indirect business taxes or consumption taxes are assumed to be levied on labor, they finance and usually exceed the remaining part of the gross social wage even in the advanced capitalist countries with more developed welfare states than the United States. Therefore, if we assume that indirect taxes are partly paid by labor, the net social wage is significantly negative in the United States (-6.0 percent to -7.5 percent of GDP over the entire postwar period) and from modestly negative to close to zero in other countries. (Maniatis, 2014: 33) The working class indeed receives only limited benefits from the state, relative to the assistance that the capitalist class does. It is interesting that the share of labour in national income has been decreasing: it has declined in advanced countries, from about 55% in 1970 to about 40% in 2015, and in emerging market and developing economies, from about 50% in mid-1990s to below 40% in 2015 (Roberts, 2017). Even if the regulation of capitalist excesses inflicted on workers (very low wages, very long hours of work) is in the interest of long-term interests of capitalists, the latter do not still accept this ‘except “under the pressure of a General Act of Parliament”’ (Marx, 1887: 315). When capitalists reluctantly give in, granting such things as ‘the compulsory regulation of the hours of labour’, they do not give in much (ibid.). Pro-worker interventions are only a ‘meagre concession wrung from capital’ (Marx, 1887: 319), and in the case of England’s Factory Act, it was ‘limited to combining elementary education with work in the factory’ (ibid.). Note that this was the case when capitalism was in a progressive phase relative to its current terminal decline stage. The state indeed continues to fail to implement its own legislation. For example, it fails to enforce the freedom of labourers as sellers of labour power: millions of unfree labourers, including children, work in slave-like conditions. The minimum wage policy is not enforced either, and where it is, usually, the government-legislated minimum wage is lower than a wage floor set within collective agreements (Boeri, 2012).25 All in all, to the extent that the state functions in support of long-term interests of capital, such intervention is more likely when (a) people fight against the effect of exploitation and (b) there are conflicts among the ruling-class elements which means that (c) interests of the working class coincide with interests of some elements of the capitalist class. State’s, or state actors’, own interests and ideas also play a role. Yet the state fails to meet the needs of the working men and women in a significant and durable manner. Capitalist agency While pro-worker interventions are due to long-term interests of capital and class struggle, the nature and scope of these interventions are also affected by capitalist class response to these interventions. The capitalist class aims to dilute and/or negate the actual impact of pro-workers policies after they are in put in place. They do this in many ways. In order to preserve their own competitive advantage, some enterprise owners complain that if a given legislation does not apply to all enterprises, it will advantage those that are not covered by it.26 Capitalists also fight welfare leg-islation on the ground that it is against workers, so they mobilize especially the right-wing politicians to make their case. The right-wing argument is that unemployment arises when laborers put too high a reserve price on their labour [power]. Labourers create unemployment by refusing to work below a certain minimum wage! This typically happens when welfare is too generous! Ergo, the best way to get rid of unemployment is to reduce welfare to zero.27 (Harvey, 2010a: 281) When a legislation is imposed on capitalists, they fight this, including through courts and political parties, on the ground that it is an ‘interference with the exploiting rights of capital’ (Marx, 1887: 319). Individual capitalists treat their private property rights as sacrosanct and beyond challenge, so mild actions against them are used to produce hyperbolic catastrophizing notion of the spectre of revolution: ‘They [capitalists] denounced the Factory Inspectors as a kind of revolutionary commissioners’ (Marx, 1887: 188).28 The capitalist tradition of perceiving, and making common people perceive, some slightly reform- mindedly liberals (e.g. Nehru, Obama, Biden) as socialists and even as sym-pathizers of Marxism continues. This is the same tradition of socialist/Left fear-mongering that treats the Democratic party of the US as being on the Left. Considering what are blatantly bourgeois views and actions as Marxist, socialist and leftists, which are then presented as a threat to everything a nation stands for, is a great way of pre-empting/avoiding any pro-worker measure. When laws regulating the capitalists do exist, capitalists can get around these laws or make it difficult for the state to enforce them, given their control over the process of production and exchange. After all, the workplace is the site of capitalists’ private legislation. This is the site of capitalists’ despotic control which is needed partly to counter potential and actual workers’ resistance inside the workplace. Consider how capitalists respond to the legislation restricting the length of the working day, the use of child labour, and so on. Capitalists resort to multiple mechanisms to get around the pro-worker laws. Firstly, capitalists make changes in the labour process. For example, they increase the speed of work, leading to increased injury to workers. Capital, more or less, goes unpunished by the state.29 They introduce a relay system: individual (child) workers come to work at different points in time in a 24-hour-day, and this makes it difficult for state officials (inspectors) to monitor whether any worker is working longer than the law allows.30 Secondly, a specific form of change in the labour process is resorting to a technological fix (mechanization), which has two adverse effects on workers. One is that it is a weapon against workers’ struggle: machinery replaces workers weakening their bargaining power. In addition, by enabling ‘the excessive addi-tion of women and children to the ranks of the workers, machinery . . . breaks down the resistance which the male operatives in the manufacturing period continued to oppose to the despotism of capital’ (Marx, 1887: 276). Besides, capital uses more efficient machines to squeeze out as much labour during the reduced working day as during the longer one. Thirdly, capitalists resort to spatial fix or threaten to do so. If laws to restrict capitalists’ freedom to exploit are in place in one country, capitalists threaten to move their capital elsewhere in order to ‘intimidate’ the state and the workers. Fourthly, capitalists resort to what can be called a temporal fix. The application of the laws that restrict capitalists’ freedom to exploit is staggered. For example, if the state seeks to raise the minimum wages, the process of increase happens over a long period of time. In the US, the Raise the Wage Act proposed to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 per hour from the current 7.25 in stages: 2021: 9.50; 2022: 11; 2023: 12.50; 2024: 14; 2025: 15.31 Similarly, laws to prevent capitalists from hiring young children (e.g. education clauses of English Factory Acts) are often staggered: these laws can allow capitalists to continue to hire younger children for a number of years, which means that the maximum age at which a child can be hired is not legally enforceable until after many years since the initial introduction of the laws.32 In other words, if adults’ working day is restricted, children are used. Consider laws aiming to restrict the working day. If there are n number of workers and an average worker works for h hour, then there is (n * h) hour of work from which surplus value will be extracted. But if, thanks to the laws that shorten the working day, the average worker works for h - x hour (where x > 0), then the total amount of work possible is n(h — x)— where n(h — x) < (n * h). This means that capital has access to less amount of total labour time of society. So n (number of available workers) has to be increased. One way of doing this is to use those sections of the working class which have not been hitherto used: children and women (and peasants and semi-proletarians as a part of the latent surplus population).”翻译为中文","completion":"除了资本的共同和相互冲突的利益之外，国家的亲工人干预背后还有国家“自身”的利益。如果普通民众在恶劣条件下生活和工作，如果他们的身体健康受损，从例如战争制造（后者，当然，最终也符合资本家阶级的利益）的角度来看，这对国家来说是不利的。资本主义国家需要大量健壮的人员参与战场，就像资本主义雇主需要他们参与工作场所一样。20 一些国家行为者的亲穷人态度也可能在一定限度内促成人们获得一些让步。当然，这些让步是由人民（工人和小规模生产者）的税收还是由资本家（和大地主）挪用的剩余部分资助的，这是一个有待商榷的问题。 3 国家亲工人干预的局限性是什么？为什么？ 过去两节中所述应被视为一种趋势：在特定条件下，国家倾向于给予一些让步，但是否实际上会这样做，以及让步的充分性如何，是一个偶然的问题。实际上，以亲工人干预的形式承诺的通常远大于实际提供的。21 国家限制资本主义对人们产生不利影响的程度是有限的。亲工人政策已经到位，但它们往往没有得到充分实施。22 通过观察社会工资可以看到国家只提供有限的福利。在一些富裕国家（澳大利亚、加拿大、德国、瑞典和英国），社会工资或总体净补贴通常是正值（但非常小的正数），23 而在美国即使在繁荣年份通常也是负值（即，净税收），“这意味着工资和薪金领取者支付的税款多于他们所获得的 — 他们帮助减少了任何现有的财政赤字”。相比之下，“在同一时期的瑞典，净社会工资大致为零，表明其慷慨的社会福利支出实际上是自我融资的”（第538页）。24 一项较新的研究得出了类似的结论： [在几乎所有发达资本主义国家中，[他们的]社会支出（特别是构成劳动福利或总社会工资的部分）必然来自总劳动收入，即来自个人所得税、社会保障缴款和其他对劳动征收的个人和财产税。只要假设间接企业税或消费税被认为是对劳动征收的，那么它们就财政上支持并通常超过即使在福利国家更发达的发达资本主义国家中的总社会工资的剩余部分。因此，如果我们假设间接税部分由劳动支付，那么在美国，净社会工资在整个战后时期显著为负（GDP的-6.0%到-7.5%），而在其他国家则从适度负值到接近零。 （Maniatis, 2014: 33） 工人阶级确实只从国家那里获得有限的福利，相对于资本家阶级所获得的援助。有趣的是，劳动力在国民收入中的份额一直在减少：在发达国家，从1970年的大约55%下降到2015年的大约40%，在新兴市场和发展中经济体，从1990年代中期的大约50%下降到2015年的不到40%（Roberts, 2017）。 即使对工人施加的资本主义过度剥削（极低工资，极长工作时间）的规制符合资本家的长期利益，后者仍然不接受这一点，“除非‘在议会的一般法案压力下’”（马克思，1887：315）。当资本家不情愿地让步，批准诸如“对劳动时间的强制性规定”等事项时，他们让步不多（同上）。亲工人干预只是“从资本中榨取的微薄让步”（马克思，1887：319），在英国工厂法案的情况下，它被“限制在将初等教育与工厂工作结合起来”（同上）。注意这是在资本主义相对于其当前终结衰退阶段的进步阶段的情况。国家确实继续未能执行其自己的立法。例如，它未能执行劳动者作为劳动力的卖家的自由：数以百万计的非自由劳动者，包括儿童，以奴隶般的条件工作。最低工资政策也未得到执行，而在执行的地方，通常，政府立法的最低工资低于集体协议设定的工资底线（Boeri, 2012）。25 总的来说，只要国家支持资本的长期利益，这种干预更有可能发生当（a）人民反抗剥削的影响和（b）统治阶级成分之间存在冲突时，这意味着（c）工人阶级的利益与资本家阶级的某些成分的利益相一致。国家或国家行为者的自身利益和观念也发挥作用。然而，国家未能以显著和持久的方式满足工人的需求。 资本家的能动性 尽管亲工人干预是由于资本的长期利益和阶级斗争，这些干预的性质和范围也受到资本家阶级对这些干预的回应的影响。资本家阶级旨在在这些政策实施后稀释和/或抵消亲工人政策的实际影响。他们以多种方式这样做。 为了保持自己的竞争优势，一些企业主抱怨如果某项立法不适用于所有企业，它将使那些不受其覆盖的企业受益。26 资本家还以它违背工人利益为由反对福利立法，因此他们动员特别是右翼政治家为他们辩护。 右翼的论点是当劳动者对他们的劳动力设定过高的保留价格时就会出现失业。劳动者拒绝在某一最低工资以下工作时会制造失业！当福利过于慷慨时通常会出现这种情况！因此，摆脱失业的最佳方式是将福利降至零。27 （哈维，2010a：281） 当立法强加于资本家时，他们包括通过法庭和政党以它是“干涉资本剥削权利”的理由对此进行抗议。个别资本家将他们的私有财产权视为神圣不可侵犯，因此对他们的温和行动被用来产生革命幽灵的夸张灾难性概念：“他们[资本家]把工厂检查员称为一种革命专员”（马克思，1887：188）。28 资本家将某些稍微改革倾向的自由派（例如尼赫鲁、奥巴马、拜登）视为社会主义者甚至马克思主义同情者的传统，以及使普通民众将其视为这种观点继续。这是恐惧社会主义/左翼的同样传统，将美国的民主党视为属于左翼。将公然属于资产阶级的观点和行动视为马克思主义、社会主义和左翼，然后将其呈现为对一个国家所代表的一切构成威胁的一种方式，是预防/避免任何亲工人措施的绝佳方式。 当存在限制资本家的法律时，资本家可以绕过这些法律或使国家难以实施它们，鉴于他们对生产和交换过程的控制。毕竟，工作场所是资本家私人立法的地点。这是资本家专制控制的地点，部分需要以对抗潜在和实际的工人内部抵抗。考虑资本家对限制工作日长度、使用童工等立法的反应。资本家采取多种机制来绕过亲工人法律。 首先，资本家对劳动过程进行改变。例如，他们增加了工作速度，导致工人受伤增加。资本在国家层面上或多或少不受惩罚。29 他们引入接力制度：个别（儿童）工人在一天24小时的不同时间点上班，这使得国家官员（检查员）难以监督任何工人是否工作超过法律允许的时间。30 其次，对劳动过程的特定形式的改变是诉诸技术解决方案（机械化），这对工人有两种不利影响。一方面，它是对工人斗争的一种武器：机器取代了工人，削弱了他们的议价能力。此外，通过“使妇女和儿童过度加入到工人队伍中，机械......打破了制造业时期男性操作工继续对资本专制的抵抗”（马克思，1887：276）。此外，资本使用更有效的机器在缩短的工作日内挤压出和较长的工作日一样多的劳动。 第三，资本家诉诸空间固定或威胁这样做。如果在一个国家实施了限制资本家剥削自由的法律，资本家威胁将他们的资本转移到其他地方，以便“恐吓”国家和工人。 第四，资本家诉诸所谓的时间固定。限制资本家剥削自由的法律的实施是分阶段的。例如，如果国家寻求提高最低工资，增加的过程会持续很长时间。在美国，提高工资法案建议将联邦最低工资从目前的7.25美元逐步提高到15美元：2021年：9.50美元；2022年：11美元；2023年：12.50美元；2024年：14美元；2025年：15美元。31 同样，禁止资本家雇佣年幼儿童的法律（例如英国工厂法案的教育条款）通常也是分阶段的：这些法律可以允许资本家在多年内继续雇佣更年轻的儿童，这意味着直到许多年后才能法律实施儿童可以被雇佣的最大年龄。32 换句话说，如果成年人的工作日受到限制，儿童就会被使用。 考虑旨在限制工作日的法律。如果有n个工人和平均每个工人工作h小时，那么总共有(n * h)小时的工作可以从中提取剩余价值。但如果由于缩短工作日的法律，平均工人工作h - x小时（其中x > 0），那么可能的总工作量是n(h - x) - 其中n(h - x) < (n * h)。这意味着资本可以获取的总劳动时间减少。因此，n（可用工人数量）必须增加。实现这一目标的一种方式是使用迄今未被使用的工人阶级的那些部分：儿童和妇女（以及农民和半无产者作为潜在剩余人口的一部分）。"},{"prompt":"请将“The state form and functioning The nature of the functioning of the state itself limits the effectivity of proworker policies. Given that pro-worker policies will adversely affect capitalists, various processes (loopholes) are put in place to restrict the positive impact of good policies on workers. Political representatives of capital within the state who, more or less, work on behalf of capital and who share ideas that reflect capitalist interests make every effort, along with capitalists, to dilute the proworker laws and/or block their proper implementation. Every law is designed in such a way that it has many exceptions, which weaken the law.33 Pro-worker laws can also be mutually contradictory thanks to the fact that they partly reflect the contradictor interests of capital and labour. For example, one law shortens the working day, and another law makes available more children for exploitation by lowering the minimum wage a child can work. The wording of the laws itself is produced in such a way that it makes it easy for the capitalists to evade them; in addition, the scope of the laws remains limited.34 If the state makes ‘elementary education a compulsory condition to the “productive” employment of children’ (Marx, 1887: 274) under a certain age, capitalists put pressure for the laws to be relaxed in order to increase the supply of labour. If the state defines, for example, the age at which a child can work for a given number of hours, then capitalists fight to reduce that age (for them, children must work for a wage at, say, 8 and not 9) and for longer hours than shorter hours.35 The state can introduce a legislation without making available adequate resources to implement it, while it has the money for the propertied class.36 If a law exists restricting the number of hours that children can work and mandating that they must receive education but if there is no mechanism to implement this law, then the law has little material effect.37 Without an adequate administrative machinery which costs money, and capitalists want a ‘cheap state’, laws are only dead letters.38 A large number of government departments, especially those that look after welfare and environmental issues, remain typically understaffed. To the extent that an administrative machinery is created, several mechanisms can impede the implementation of pro-worker laws. For one, while statistical information is so important for state interventions, there are officials responsible for collecting social statistics, but they might not be given ‘plenary powers to get at the truth’ (Marx, 1887: 7). Sometimes, statistical data carefully collected by state workers are withheld if they reveal governmental failure.39 There might not be enough people who are ‘as competent’ and who are ‘free from partisanship’ (ibid.).40 Indeed, state officials, influenced by capitalist thinking, may not always perform their duties.41 Under neoliberal capitalism, this partisanship has reached a high level. The top layers of the state bureaucracy openly advocate for pro-business policies. In the neoliberal capitalist state, the personnel ‘are closely aligned to the views of the Bretton Woods institutions’ and are 1 deeply enmeshed with the world of finance and big business’ (Patnaik, 2010). Their ‘motivation is no different from that of the big bourgeoisie and financial interests’ and they have ‘no compunctions about being closely integrated with the latter’ (ibid.). The non-implementation of pro-worker laws is because of a distinct feature of state form: those who formulate laws are not responsible for their execution, and the common people are not involved in the ways the state works; in other words, the state works bureaucratically. And the state has to be bureaucratic: if every person participates in the everyday functioning of the state, there will be no state. Capitalists can even bribe state officials and politicians to ignore the violation of state regulations on their (capitalists’) part, including those concerning workplace safety. The bribe is after all a small proportion of their saving that accrues due to compromise on workers’ safety. Capitalists simply may not submit to a law.42 Capitalists can and do knowingly violate safety and other regulations, fully confident that any penalty the state might impose (after long legal battles that most workers as workers or as consumers can ill-afford) is a small deduction from the extra money they have made. While there are strong limits to state spending for workers, a similar limit with respect to the financial assistance (including tax breaks) to capitalists does not usually exist. They receive a massive amount of state revenue, both during an economic crisis (so-called bailout package) and when certain segments of capital are judged to be too big to fail. There is little limit put on state spending on coercion (military and policing) needed to threaten workers and crush their resistance domestically as well as to counter any resistance to ‘its’ interests in foreign countries (and this shows that a mere increase in taxes on the super-rich and consequent increase in state revenue will not necessarily benefit the masses as they have little control over the state’s spending). The so-called democratic form of the state is no barrier at all to how the state works for the capitalists. If capitalists cannot make money, the state’s help arrives. However, if the masses do not have enough food and shelter or money to pay school fees, a similar approach does not exist. Anti-working-class intervention by the state and lack of proletarian power The introduction of a pro-labour measure and its actual implementation, generally speaking, depend on the intensity of class struggle of the masses. They depend on, within limits, the balance of power between capital and labour in society and within the state. Unionization (greater union density) used to have some positive impact on social expenditure by the government (see Hooghe and Oser, 2016). Once a pro-worker measure is introduced, unions and workplace committees can have a positive impact on their actual implementation too. No wonder unions have been under attack by the capitalist class and their state, in forms that are direct or indirect. These include police attacks on unions, firing union leaders and some of the unionized workers, restrictions on trade union rights, influencing and corrupting union leaders, contractualization, making it easy for capital to hire and fire, and the threat of geographical relocation. In addition, the state (along with capitalist employers) promote and make use of divisions within the working class (on the basis of race, gender, location, nationality, and so on) — the divisions which are also promoted by the relatively educated and well-off sections of the wage-earning class trying to better their own situation on the basis of their special status defined by race, gender, and the like. These divisions — often mistakenly seen as the primary cleavages that are more fun-damental than class divisions — weaken class consciousness and organization. In many cases, well-paid union leaders, capitalists, and state apparatuses form a bloc which fundamentally goes against rank-and-file workers’ interest. So the relation between workers’ trade union power and pro-worker measures has been weakened. The sphere of production is a sphere of the political battle between capital and labour. So all the interventions by the state aimed at reducing the bargaining power in the labour market also reduce workers’ power on the shop floor. The Taft-Hartley Act passed in 1947 in the US is an example of class struggle from above (Figure 9.1): it restricts organizing capacities of unions and allows state-level ‘right to work’ legislation. Austerity measures are an example of class struggle from above as well (Cockburn, 2004). It is incontrovertible that the working class lacks power at the site of production and often in the labour market as well. Such lack of power is expressed in the fact that the capitalist class can pay a wage which does not cover the cost of reproduction of workers. Workers are often compelled to accept whatever wage that is offered by the masters. But the working class also lacks power to control the state, that is, to control the common affairs of society as a whole. Above all, it has no control over the coercive power of the state. Workers are ‘slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State’ (Marx and Engels, 1848: 18). Besides, given its lack of control over means of production and subsistence, how long can workers go on a strike and live on their limited savings? ‘The capitalist can live longer without the worker than can the worker without the capitalist’ (Marx, 1977a/1844: 21). So, in terms of the ongoing context between capital and labour, ultimately, ‘[v]ictory goes necessarily to the capitalist’ (ibid.). But victory will not go to the capitalist if the state, for example, feeds the workers during their strike. But the state will not do this because, in spite of its appearance, the state is inherently capitalists’ and not workers’. Capitalist control over economy and crisis-prone accumulation process As we have seen, the relations of equal exchange impose no limit on how long individual capitalists can make people work in a day: if capitalists have bought the commodity (labour power), they can use it as much as they wish to, according to the law of commodity, which the state itself supports. And even if the state introduces pro-worker measures (e.g. ‘legal limitation of the working day’) due to the pressure from below, the state, which is a class-state, cannot generally do much about macro-economic features of capitalist society which adversely impact workers. These include ‘the diminution of employment caused by the competition of machinery’ or indeed ‘by changes in the quality of the labourers employed’ (Marx, 1887: 385). The state cannot do anything about these features because it is capitalists’ right to use machines or a particular kind of labour (e.g. child labour, immigrant labour, and so on). There is, of course, nothing natural about the state’s inability mentioned earlier: for example, when the length of the working day is shortened, forced idleness (= unemployment) could be checked by spreading the working time (across workers from different sectors and areas) throughout the year, but this does not happen. This could happen if the state really was the state of the majority.”翻译为中文","completion":"国家形式和运作 国家自身的运作性质限制了亲工人政策的有效性。鉴于亲工人政策将对资本家产生不利影响，各种流程（漏洞）被建立起来以限制良好政策对工人的积极影响。国家内部代表资本的政治代表，或多或少为代表资本工作，他们持有反映资本家利益的观念，他们与资本家一起，尽一切努力淡化亲工人法律和/或阻碍其正确实施。每项法律都以这样一种方式设计，即包含许多例外，这些例外削弱了法律。33 由于反映了资本和劳动的矛盾利益，亲工人法律也可能相互矛盾。例如，一项法律缩短了工作日，而另一项法律通过降低儿童可以工作的最低工资，使更多的儿童可供剥削。 法律的措辞本身以这样一种方式制定，使得资本家容易逃避法律；此外，法律的范围保持有限。34如果国家使“基础教育成为一定年龄以下的儿童‘生产性’就业的强制条件”（马克思，1887: 274），资本家会施压要求放宽法律以增加劳动力供应。如果国家定义了一个孩子可以工作的年龄和工作小时数，那么资本家会争取降低这个年龄（对他们而言，儿童必须在比如说8岁而不是9岁时为工资工作）并争取更长的工作时间而不是更短的时间。35 国家可以在没有提供足够执行资源的情况下引入立法，而它却有钱为拥有财产的阶级提供资金。36 如果存在限制儿童工作时间的法律，并规定他们必须接受教育，但如果没有执行这一法律的机制，那么该法律几乎没有实质性效果。37 没有足够的行政机构（这需要资金），而资本家希望有一个“廉价的国家”，法律只是一纸空文。38 许多政府部门，特别是那些负责福利和环境问题的部门，通常人手不足。在建立了行政机构的情况下，几种机制可以阻碍亲工人法律的实施。首先，虽然社会统计信息对于国家干预非常重要，但负责收集社会统计数据的官员可能没有被赋予“获得真相的全权”（马克思，1887: 7）。有时，国家工作人员认真收集的统计数据被隐瞒，如果它们揭示了政府的失败。39 可能没有足够的“有能力”且“没有党派偏见”的人员（同上）。40 事实上，受到资本主义思想影响的国家官员可能并不总是履行他们的职责。41 在新自由主义资本主义下，这种党派性达到了很高的水平。国家官僚机构的高层公开倡导亲商业政策。在新自由主义资本主义国家，行政人员“与布雷顿森林机构的观点密切一致”，并且“与金融和大企业的世界深度交织”（帕特奈克，2010）。他们的“动机与大资产阶级和金融利益没有不同”，他们“毫不犹豫地与后者紧密融合”（同上）。 亲工人法律未得到执行是因为国家形式的一个独特特征：制定法律的人不负责执行，普通民众也不参与国家的运作方式；换句话说，国家以官僚的方式运作。而且国家必须是官僚的：如果每个人都参与国家的日常运作，就不会有国家了。 资本家甚至可以贿赂国家官员和政治家来忽视他们（资本家）方面对国家法规的违反，包括那些关于工作场所安全的规定。毕竟，贿赂仅仅是他们由于在工人安全上的妥协而获得的节省的一小部分。资本家根本可能不遵守法律。42 资本家可以并且确实故意违反安全和其他法规，完全有信心国家可能施加的任何处罚（在大多数工人作为工人或消费者难以负担的长期法律斗争之后）只是从他们赚取的额外金钱中扣除的一小部分。 尽管对工人的国家支出存在严格限制，但与对资本家的金融援助（包括税收减免）通常不存在类似限制。他们在经济危机期间（所谓的纾困方案）和某些资本部门被判断为“太大而不能失败”时获得大量国家收入。对于国家在威胁工人和镇压其国内抵抗以及对抗任何外国对“其”利益的抵抗所需的强制（军事和警察）的支出几乎没有限制（这表明仅仅增加对超级富豪的税收和随之增加的国家收入不一定会使大众受益，因为他们几乎无法控制国家的支出）。所谓的国家民主形式对国家为资本家服务的方式根本没有障碍。如果资本家不能赚钱，国家的帮助就会到来。然而，如果大众没有足够的食物和住所或金钱支付学费，类似的做法并不存在。 国家的反工人阶级干预和无产阶级权力的缺乏 引入亲劳动者措施及其实际实施，一般来说，取决于大众阶级斗争的强度。他们在一定限度内，取决于社会和国家内资本与劳动之间的力量平衡。 工会化（更高的工会密度）曾对政府的社会支出产生一些积极影响（见Hooghe和Oser，2016）。一旦引入亲工人措施，工会和工作场所委员会也可以对其实际实施产生积极影响。难怪资本家阶级及其国家对工会进行攻击，形式直接或间接。这些包括对工会的警察攻击，解雇工会领导和一些工会化工人，限制工会权利，影响和腐化工会领导，合同化，使资本雇佣和解雇变得容易，以及地理位置转移的威胁。此外，国家（与资本家雇主一道）利用并加强工人阶级内部的分歧（基于种族、性别、地点、国籍等）——这些分歧也由相对受过教育和富裕的工资阶层试图基于他们的特殊地位（由种族、性别等定义）改善自己的处境而促进。这些分歧——常常被错误地视为比阶级分裂更根本的主要裂痕——削弱了阶级意识和组织。在许多情况下，薪酬丰厚的工会领导、资本家和国家机关形成了一个基本上违背普通工人利益的集团。因此，工人工会力量与亲工人措施之间的关系已经被削弱。 生产领域是资本与劳动之间政治斗争的领域。因此，国家旨在减少劳动力市场议价能力的所有干预也减少了工人在车间的力量。1947年在美国通过的塔夫脱-哈特利法案是上层阶级斗争的一个例子（图9.1）：它限制了工会的组织能力，并允许州级“工作权”立法。紧缩措施也是上层阶级斗争的一个例子（Cockburn, 2004）。 不可争辩的是，工人阶级在生产现场乃至劳动力市场上缺乏力量。这种缺乏力量表现在资本家阶级可以支付不足以覆盖工人再生产成本的工资上。工人往往被迫接受雇主提供的任何工资。但工人阶级也缺乏控制国家的力量，即控制整个社会的共同事务。最重要的是，它无法控制国家的强制力量。工人是“资产阶级和资产阶级国家的奴隶”（马克思和恩格斯，1848：18）。此外，鉴于其对生产资料和生计手段的控制缺乏，工人能以有限的积蓄罢工多久并生活呢？“资本家可以在没有工人的情况下活得更久，而工人没有资本家则不行”（马克思，1977a/1844：21）。因此，在资本与劳动之间持续的对抗中，最终，“胜利必然归于资本家”（同上）。但如果国家例如在工人罢工期间给工人提供食物，胜利就不会归于资本家。但国家不会这样做，因为尽管表面上看来，国家本质上是资本家的而不是工人的。 资本家对经济的控制和危机倾向的积累过程 正如我们所见，平等交换关系没有限制单个资本家可以让人们一天工作多长时间：如果资本家购买了商品（劳动力），他们可以根据商品法则（国家本身支持的法则）尽可能多地使用它。即使国家由于来自下层的压力引入了亲工人措施（例如，“对工作日的法律限制”），国家，作为一个阶级国家，通常无法对影响工人不利的资本主义社会的宏观经济特征做太多事情。这些特征包括“由机器竞争引起的就业减少”或确实“由雇佣劳动者的质量变化引起的就业减少”（马克思，1887：385）。国家对这些特征无能为力，因为使用机器或特定类型的劳动力（例如儿童劳动力、移民劳动力等）是资本家的权利。当然，国家无能为力并不是自然的：例如，当工作日缩短时，强制性闲置（=失业）可以通过在全年内分配工作时间（跨越不同行业和地区的工人）来检查，但这并未发生。如果国家真的是多数人的国家，这是可能的。"},{"prompt":"请将“The interests of capitalists and those of workers contradict each other. There are fundamental conflicts, rooted in private property and production relations, over wealth and income or value and surplus value. Consider the limit to the rise in wages. There are two scenarios here. In one scenario, and as Marx says in chapter 25 of Capital volume 1, if investment (c + v) increases, without c / v increasing (much), wages can rise.43 As soon as living standards increase via an increase in real wages per hour worked, other things constant, the normal rate of profit (or of exploitation) will be affected. This will put a stop to the rise in wages. Instead of c + v, and departing from Marx a little bit, we can use state policy in favour of workers and arrive at the same conclusion: the state policy can raise wages but not beyond a point (Figure 9.2). Note also that state policy can contribute to a rise in c + v. In another scenario, when c + v increases and c / v also increases, the situation is worse: when c / v rises, with mechanization displacing labour, a relative surplus population is produced which adversely affects the bargaining power of the employed segments of the working class and reduces their wages: ‘The constant generation of a relative surplus-population keeps the law of supply and demand of labour, and therefore keeps wages, in a rut that corresponds with the wants of capital’ (Marx, 1887: 523). Of course, and once again, there is nothing absolutely natural here (in the purely economic sense): an increase in c + v combined with an increase in c / v will not adversely affect the workers, if the relative surplus population’s needs are fully met by the state on the basis of adequate unemployment insurance and/or if they are employed by the state with decent wages, and so on, but the state does not do this (Figure 9.2). For the state to do that would be to counter the very mechanism by which accumulation happens, wages are determined and the rate of exploitation kept at an acceptable level: in that sense the ‘surplus population becomes . . . the lever of capitalistic accumulation, nay, a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production’ (ibid.: 444). If workers belong to one of the oppressed groups (women, children, low caste, Blacks, and so on), their situation is even worse. In fact, when c + v rises, wages can rise and do rise, but the state policy often increases unemployment (through an appropriate interest rate policy, for example) and reduces workers’ bargaining power by suppressing strikes (Figure 9.2). So the accumulation interests of capitalists, supported by the state, limit the extent to which state can benefit the workers. Similarly, if small-scale producer’s marketed surplus is given a remunerative price by the state (cost price plus a revenue that is necessary for a decent living), the cost of production, including of raw materials and wage goods, will go up and will hurt the capitalist profits, so small-scale producers do not receive a good price for their produce.44 In other words, a large segment of the working population has to live a life of poverty or semi-poverty and economic insecurity so an average rate of profit for capital is guaranteed, and it is the state’s responsibility to ensure this if normal market mechanisms fail to.45 The state cannot be in the business of undermining the ‘condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production’. The financial means for state social welfare measures ultimately originate in the capital accumulation process, regardless of whether these measures are financed by social insurance contributions, taxes, and the like. A portion of total social value is used by the state in order to improve the conditions of the working class. This means that the mass of surplus value is reduced in the hands of capitalists for reinvestment. It is usually the case that the more the state gives to the people, the less there is for the ruling classes (and for top layers within the state itself, who are very close to the ruling classes). A state policy can reduce workers’ access to state-provided services in order to, for example, reduce the tax burden on the capitalist class. Every dollar that the state spends on military — in the interest of the military-industrial complex, if not the capitalist class as a whole — could be spent by it on workers’ welfare, but it is not. As we have seen in an earlier chapter, the state is the personification of illusory common interests and supports the two other forms of personification (capital’s as well as labour’s), which are mutually contradictory. For example, while capital wants people to work longer and pay a lower wage, and labour wants to work shorter hours and get a higher wage. This contradiction is represented within the state. This is partly reflected in the state legislations that seek to help workers a bit but make numerous deliberate concessions to capital in the body of given legislations themselves. Even if the state somehow makes sure that wages rise, that fact, more or less, means that pro-worker legislations, just like an increase in accumulation with c / v constant, only reproduce workers as ‘better-fed slaves’ (Figure 9.2): a rise in wages ‘only means, in fact, that the length and weight of the golden chain the wage worker has already forged for himself [or herself], allow of a relaxation of the tension of it’ (Marx, 1887: 436). This would be the case whether the rise in wages is ‘a consequence of accumulation of capital’ or of state policy. In other words, ‘just as little as better clothing, food, and treatment, and a larger peculium, do away with the exploitation of the slave, so little do they set aside that of the wage worker’ (ibid.). Like an increase in c + v raising wages, pro-worker interventions can only diminish the impact of the golden chain. The welfare measures ‘safeguard the existence of workers in a manner consistent with capitalism, namely as wage-labourers’ (Heinrich, 2004: 208). Even if wages rise, workers still are not free not to sell their labour power to a capitalist, and they still have little control over what happens in a workplace and over their product. Given the antagonism between capital’s interest and common people’s interest, state social welfare measures (e.g. social security, unemployment insurance, old-age pension) are usually contingent not only upon a good pace of accumulation (rise in c + v) but also upon the sale of labour power or the willingness to sell labour power or prior labour-market participation, and, this means that these measures act as a disciplining force (Figure 9.2). The payment of unemployment insurance or welfare is also contingent upon their active effort to sell their labour power, or else benefits will be reduced or suspended. Therefore, ‘[t]he benefits of the welfare state . . . do not free one from the compulsion to sell one’s labour power’ (Heinrich, 2004: 208). Because the state must reproduce workers as workers, this fact sets the limits to what it can do for them (i.e. how much improvement can be granted) (Figure 9.2). Given capitalist class relations which the state must defend, longterm economic interests of capital (e.g. the need to earn an average rate of profit) cannot be significantly undermined by the state over a long period of time. The state must maintain enough people separated from means of production and subsistence. They cannot provide things for free to people even if they need them badly and even if things are available in society. Too high a level of wage — which the state could ensure by using its coercive or legislative power against private employers — could allow a worker to convert their savings into capital. Too much benefit from the state (social wage) could weaken the commodity status of labour power and increase its bargaining power vis-à-vis capital. The main goal of the state is to reproduce capitalist class relations by suppressing class struggle from below, and therefore state’s concessions cannot override this imperative. The ongoing pandemic that began in early 2020 provides evidence for this.46 There is an important relation between the state and the (gendered) repro-duction of the working-class families. Kollontai (1920) recognizes that ‘[t]he more the workers became conscious of their rights and the better they were organised, the more society had to relieve the family of the care of the children’, and that ‘[e]ven in capitalist society the education of the child in primary schools and later in secondary and higher educational establishments became the responsibility of the state’. However, she says, ‘bourgeois society [is] afraid of going too far towards meeting the interests of the working class, lest this contribute to the break-up of the family’. Why? Kollontai (1920) provides an answer: For the capitalists are well aware that the old type of family, where the woman is a slave and where the husband is responsible for the well-being of his wife and children, constitutes the best weapon in the struggle to stifle the desire of the working class for freedom and to weaken the revolutionary spirit of the working man and working woman. The worker is weighed down by his family cares and is obliged to compromise with capital. The father and mother are ready to agree to any terms when their children are hungry. The aforementioned idea, more or less, applies to families where both parents or primary care-givers are wage workers. In any case, the general conclusion is that ‘[c]apitalist society has not been able to transform education’, and other areas of social reproduction of people such as health, including public health ‘into a truly social and state matter because the property owners, the bourgeoisie, have been against this’ (ibid.). While an educated and healthy workforce is in the interest of capitalism and while that need prompts state measures in favour of workers, there is a limit to what is possible within capitalism, this irrational system of social production: ‘[T]he capitalist mode of production, owing to its very nature, excludes all rational improvement beyond a certain point.’ (Marx, 1887: 316). It is impossible to wring from capital what labour needs for a safe and healthy working condition and healthy life, beyond a minimum level. In fact, unhealthy life and unsafe working conditions, just like un- and under-employment and precarity, ‘are necessary conditions to the existence of capital’ (ibid.).47 Any significant pro-worker state policy means that ‘[t]he very root of the capitalist mode of production, i.e., the self-expansion of all capital, large or small, by means of the “free” purchase and consumption of labour-power, would be attacked’ so such a policy is ‘brought to a deadlock’ (ibid.). So the state is seen as a source of rationality (it is expected to intervene if workers are subjected to excessive abuses), but that rationality is irrational as it will not go beyond the rationality of the minority class; the state must create conditions for profit-making at the expense of the masses. It is true that state welfare measures happen in part because of workers’ struggle, but, as mentioned already, the workers that are reproduced through state welfare — just like the workers reproduced through a regime of increased wages due to a rise in c + v, with c /— constant — are the workers that ultimately produce surplus value for the capitalists. Even if workers’ struggle is allowed and tolerated, the state and capital make sure that ‘the struggle between capital and labour [is confined] within limits comfortable for capital’ (Marx, 1887: 525).”翻译为中文","completion":"资本家的利益与工人的利益相矛盾。围绕财富和收入或价值和剩余价值，存在着根植于私有财产和生产关系中的基本冲突。考虑提高工资的限制。这里有两种情况。在一种情况下，正如马克思在《资本论》第一卷第25章中所说，如果投资（c + v）增加，而c / v没有（显著）增加，工资可以上涨。43 一旦通过每小时工作实际工资的增加提高了生活水平，其他条件不变，正常的利润率（或剥削率）将受到影响。这将停止工资的上涨。我们可以使用支持工人的国家政策代替c + v，稍微偏离马克思一点，我们可以得出相同的结论：国家政策可以提高工资，但不能超过一个点（图9.2）。还要注意，国家政策可以促进c + v的增加。在另一种情况下，当c + v增加且c / v也增加时，情况更糟：当c / v上升时，机械化取代劳动力，产生了相对剩余人口，这对受雇工人阶级的议价能力产生不利影响，并降低他们的工资：“相对剩余人口的持续产生，维持了劳动力供求的法则，因此维持了与资本需求相符的工资水平”（马克思，1887：523）。 当然，再次重申，这里没有绝对的自然规律（在纯经济意义上）：如果相对剩余人口的需求得到国家基于充分的失业保险的满足，或者他们以体面的工资被国家雇佣，等等，那么c + v的增加与c / v的增加不会对工人产生不利影响，但国家没有这样做（图9.2）。对于国家来说，这将是对积累发生机制、工资决定以及保持接受程度的剥削率的反制：从这个意义上来说，“剩余人口成为了...资本积累的杠杆，甚至是资本主义生产方式存在的条件”（同上：444）。 如果工人属于被压迫群体（女性、儿童、低种姓、黑人等），他们的处境更糟。实际上，当c + v上升时，工资可以也确实上升，但国家政策往往增加了失业（例如，通过适当的利率政策）并通过压制罢工减少了工人的议价能力（图9.2）。因此，资本家的积累利益，得到国家支持，限制了国家能在多大程度上使工人受益。 同样，如果小规模生产者的市场化剩余由国家以回报性价格（成本价格加上合理生活所必需的收入）购买，生产成本，包括原材料和工资商品的成本，将上升并损害资本家的利润，因此小规模生产者不会为他们的产品获得好价格。44 换句话说，大部分工人阶级不得不过着贫穷或半贫穷和经济不安全的生活，以保证资本的平均利润率，如果正常市场机制未能实现，国家有责任确保这一点。45 国家无法从事破坏“资本主义生产方式存在条件”的业务。 国家社会福利措施的财政手段最终源于资本积累过程，无论这些措施是由社会保险缴款、税收等资助的。国家利用总社会价值的一部分来改善工人阶级的条件。这意味着资本家用于再投资的剩余价值总量减少了。通常情况是，国家给予人民的越多，统治阶级（以及国家内部与统治阶级非常接近的高层）就越少。国家政策可以减少工人获得国家提供服务的机会，以便例如减轻资本家阶级的税收负担。国家在军事上的每一美元支出——为了军事工业复合体的利益，如果不是为了整个资本家阶级的利益——都可以用于工人福利，但实际上并未如此。 正如我们在前一章中看到的，国家是虚幻共同利益的体现，并支持资本（以及劳动）的其他两种形式的体现，这些形式是相互矛盾的。例如，虽然资本希望人们工作更长时间并支付较低的工资，而劳动希望工作时间更短并获得更高的工资。这种矛盾在国家内部得到体现。这在部分反映在旨在略微帮助工人但在给定立法本身中故意做出许多让步给资本的国家立法中。 即使国家以某种方式确保工资上涨，这个事实或多或少意味着，亲工人立法，就像c / v保持不变的情况下积累增加一样，只是再生产“更好喂养的奴隶”（图9.2）：工资的上涨“实际上只意味着，工资工人为自己（或她自己）已经锻造的金链的长度和重量，允许放松它的张力”（马克思，1887：436）。无论工资的上涨是“资本积累的结果”还是国家政策的结果，都是如此。换句话说，“更好的服装、食物和待遇，以及更大的财产，并不能消除奴隶的剥削，也不能撤销工资工人的剥削”（同上）。 就像c + v的增加提高工资一样，亲工人干预只能减少金链的影响。福利措施“以一种与资本主义相一致的方式保障工人的存在，即作为工资劳动者”（海因里希，2004：208）。即使工资上涨，工人仍然无法不向资本家出售他们的劳动力，他们仍然对工作场所和他们的产品几乎没有控制权。 鉴于资本的利益与普通民众的利益之间的对立，国家社会福利措施（例如社会保障、失业保险、养老金）通常不仅取决于良好的积累速度（c + v的上升），而且还取决于劳动力的出售或出售劳动力的意愿或先前的劳动力市场参与，这意味着这些措施充当了一种约束力（图9.2）。失业保险或福利的支付也取决于他们积极努力出售他们的劳动力，否则福利将被减少或暂停。因此，“福利国家的好处......并不能使人摆脱出售自己劳动力的强迫”（海因里希，2004：208）。 由于国家必须将工人作为工人再生产，这一事实设定了国家能为他们做的事情的限制（即可以给予多少改善）（图9.2）。鉴于国家必须捍卫的资本主义阶级关系，资本的长期经济利益（例如赚取平均利润率的需要）不能被国家在长期内显著削弱。国家必须保持足够的人与生产资料和生计手段分离。即使人们迫切需要，即使社会上有可用的东西，他们也不能免费提供给人们。太高的工资水平——国家可以通过对私人雇主使用其强制或立法权力来确保——可能会让工人将他们的储蓄转化为资本。国家提供的太多福利（社会工资）可能会削弱劳动力的商品身份，并增加其对资本的议价能力。国家的主要目标是通过镇压来自下层的阶级斗争来再生产资本主义阶级关系，因此国家的让步不能推翻这一必要性。2020年初开始的持续大流行为此提供了证据。46 国家与（性别化的）工人阶级家庭再生产之间存在重要关系。科隆泰（1920）认识到，“工人越是意识到他们的权利并且组织得越好，社会就越必须减轻家庭对儿童的照顾负担”，并且“即使在资本主义社会，儿童的教育也成为国家的责任，从小学到后来的中学和高等教育机构”。然而，她说，“资产阶级社会害怕过多地满足工人阶级的利益，以免这导致家庭的瓦解”。为什么？科隆泰（1920）提供了答案： 因为资本家深知，女性是奴隶、丈夫负责妻子和孩子的福祉的旧式家庭，是在斗争中扼杀工人阶级追求自由的愿望并削弱工人和工妇的革命精神的最佳武器。工人被家庭负担拖累，不得不与资本妥协。父母在孩子们挨饿时准备接受任何条件。 上述观点或多或少适用于父母或主要照护者都是工资工人的家庭。无论如何，一般的结论是，“资本主义社会未能改革教育”，以及其他人的社会再生产领域，如健康，包括公共卫生“成为真正的社会和国家事务，因为财产所有者，资产阶级反对这一点”（同上）。 虽然受过教育和健康的劳动力符合资本主义的利益，而这种需求促使国家采取有利于工人的措施，但资本主义这一非理性的社会生产制度内存在改善的限制：“资本主义生产方式由于其本质，排除了超出一定点的所有理性改进。”（马克思，1887：316）。要从资本中获取劳动所需的安全和健康的工作条件和健康生活，超出最低水平是不可能的。事实上，不健康的生活和不安全的工作条件，就像失业和就业不足以及不稳定性一样，“是资本存在的必要条件”（同上）。47 任何显著的亲工人国家政策意味着“资本主义生产方式的根本，即，所有资本，无论大小，通过‘自由’购买和消费劳动力的自我扩张，将受到攻击”，因此这样的政策“陷入僵局”（同上）。 所以国家被视为理性的源泉（如果工人受到过度滥用，预期会进行干预），但那种理性是非理性的，因为它不会超出少数阶级的理性；国家必须在牺牲大众的情况下创造利润条件。确实，国家福利措施部分是因为工人的斗争而发生的，但如前所述，通过国家福利再生产的工人——就像通过c / v上升而工资增加的政权再生产的工人一样——最终为资本家生产剩余价值。即使允许和容忍工人的斗争，国家和资本确保“资本与劳动之间的斗争[局限于]资本感到舒适的界限内”（马克思，1887：525）。"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const
