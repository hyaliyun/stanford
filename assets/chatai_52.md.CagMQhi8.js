In this configuration, squares labeled 0 are only adjacent to squares labeled 1, and vice versa. This implies that squares forming an \\"X\\" are all the same number. 2. **Ways to Color Each Group**: The number of ways to color the cells labeled 0 is the same as coloring the cells labeled 1, each contributing (sqrt{N}). Thus, if (a_{2n}) is the number of ways to color the 0-labeled squares in a (3 times 2n) grid without forming a monochromatic \\"X\\", and we aim to find (a_{10}), then (N = (a_{10})^2). 3. **Recursion Establishment**: We consider: - (a_{2n}): The number of ways to color the squares labeled 0 in a (3 times 2n) grid. - (b_{2n}): The number of ways to color such a grid without having two black or two white squares in the rightmost column and without forming a monochromatic \\"X\\". 4. **Two Cases**: - **Case 1**: All three squares in the last two columns are the same color. - For (a_{2n}): 2 ways to color these three squares. - For (b_{2n}): 1 way. - Remaining (2n-2) columns can be colored in (b_{2n-2}) ways. - **Case 2**: The last three squares are not the same color. - For (a_{2n}): 6 ways. - For (b_{2n}): 5 ways. - Remaining (2n-2) columns can be colored in (a_{2n-2}) ways.

Prove that: a) The S A B C tetrahedron is regular. b) Conversely, for any regular tetrahedron, there exist five spheres with the aforementioned properties.","completion":"Part (a): Prove that the tetrahedron SABC is regular 1. **Understanding Sphere and Tangents:** A line t and a sphere G are tangent at point T if and only if T is their unique common point. Any plane S passing through t intersects the sphere G in a circle k, except for the plane that is perpendicular to the radius of G at T, which touches G only at T. Thus, each circle k and line t also touch at T because T is the unique common point of t and k. 2. **Identifying Points and Tangent Circles:** Let G_1 be one of the spheres that touches all edges of the tetrahedron SABC=N. Let D, E, F, H, J, and K be the tangency points on edges AB, BC, CA, SA, SB, and SC respectively. Let k_s, k_c, k_a, and k_b be the intersections of G_1 with the planes ABC, SAB, SBC, and SCA respectively. These are indeed circles. For example, k_s passes through D, E, F, which are distinct points since AB, BC, CA do not have a common point apart from their vertices. 3. **Characterizing Circles:** Each circle k_s, k_c, k_a, k_b touches the respective triangle's sides either as the incircle or an excircle. The incircle touches all sides internally, while each excircle touches one side internally and the other two externally. 4. **Combination Cases:** Examine possible combinations. Assume k_s is the incircle of triangle ABC (i.e., D, E, F are on proper segments), and let H be on the extension of SA beyond A (first figure). Thus, k_c and k_b must be excircles for triangle SAB and triangle SCA, respectively, meaning J and K are on extensions of SB and SC beyond B and C. Thus, G_1 provides one incircle and three excircles. Another three spheres (G_2, G_3, G_4) are obtained similarly by considering other combinations where a different circle is the incircle and the rest are excircles. If all tangent circles such as k_s, k_c, k_a, and k_b are incircles (second figure), implying G_5 exists. Here, every plane of the tetrahedron cuts out an incircle from G_5. 5. **Existence of Tangent Spheres:** Verify that having five such spheres implies the tetrahedron is regular.

The center for each of these internal configurations remains equidistant from corresponding sides.

The sine function has a range from -1 to 1, so the expression sin left(x + frac{pi}{3}right) must be within this interval: [ -1 leq sin left(x + frac{pi}{3}right) leq 1. ] 3.

If a similar cube is twice as long, twice as wide, and twice as high, then each side of the new cube will be 2 times the length of the original cube's side.

To find numbers with more 1's than 0's, we examine all numbers up to 2^{11} - 1 = 2047. The counting process focuses only on 1 to 1500. We know the sum of all elements in rows 0 through 10 of Pascal’s triangle is: [ 2^0 + 2^1 + cdots + 2^{10} = 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 ] The center elements are: [ 1 + 2 + 6 + 20 + 70 + 252 = 351 ] The sum of elements on or to the right of the line of symmetry for rows 0 to 10 is: [ frac{2047 + 351}{2} = 1199 ] However, this sum includes all numbers up to 2047. From 1501 to 2047 (which is 547 numbers), we should only include those numbers which have more 1's than 0's. From 1501 (which is around 10111011101_2) to 2047, a manual count shows that for these higher numbers nearly every binary representation will possess more 1's due to the higher order bits. We're considering numbers only up to 1500, so we need to exclude those additional numbers between 1501 and 2047 that we previously included. Since 1500 is less than 1984 (which is 11111000000_2), the additional amount to exclude is not easily computable through simple symmetry arguments as used before, and would require binary enumeration.

For the distances (MX), (MY), and (MZ) from the center of the large circle to the centers of the semi-circles: - (MX = r - 4) - (MY = r - 3) - (MZ = r - 5) Using the distance formula, we set up equations: [ (s - 0)^2 + (t - 4)^2 = (r - 4)^2 ] [ (s - 3)^2 + (t - 0)^2 = (r - 3)^2 ] [ (s - 3)^2 + (t - 4)^2 = (r - 5)^2 ] 7. **Solving the Equations**: By subtracting the last equation from each of the first two equations, we get: - Subtracting the third equation from the first: [ s^2 + (t - 4)^2 - (s - 3)^2 - (t - 4)^2 = (r - 4)^2 - (r - 5)^2 ] Simplifies to: [ s^2 - (s^2 - 6s + 9) = r^2 - 8r + 16 - (r^2 - 10r + 25) ] [ 6s - 9 = 2r - 9 quad Rightarrow quad r = 3s ] - Subtracting the third equation from the second: [ (s - 3)^2 + t^2 - (s - 3)^2 - (t - 4)^2 = (r - 3)^2 - (r - 5)^2 ] Simplifies to: [ t^2 - (t^2 - 8t + 16) = r^2 - 6r + 9 - (r^2 - 10r + 25) ] [ 8t - 16 = 4r - 16 quad Rightarrow quad r = 2t ] 8. **Combining the Results**: Substitute (s = frac{1}{3} r) and (t = frac{1}{2} r) back into one of the original equations, for instance, the first equation: [ left(frac{1}{3} rright)^2 + left(frac{1}{2} r - 4right)^2 = (r - 4)^2 ] Simplifies to: [ frac{1}{9} r^2 + left(frac{r}{2} - 4right)^2 = r^2 - 8r + 16 ] Expanding and simplifying: [ frac{1}{9} r^2 + frac{1}{4} r^2 - 4r + 16 = r^2 - 8r + 16 ] [ frac{1}{9} r^2 + frac{1}{4} r^2 + 4r = r^2 ] Multiply through by 36 to clear fractions: [ 4r^2 + 9r^2 + 144r = 36r^2 ] [ 144r = 23r^2 ] Solving for (r): [ 0 = r(23r - 144) quad Rightarrow quad r = 0 text{ (impossible)} quad text{or} quad r = frac{144}{23} ] 9. **Final Answer**: [ boxed{frac{144}{23}} ]"},{"prompt":"Show that there is no arithmetic progression of 1999 distinct positive primes all less than 12345.","completion":"To show that there is no arithmetic progression of 1999 distinct positive primes all less than 12345, let's consider the given arithmetic progression. Suppose there is such an arithmetic progression of primes, denoted by: [a, a+d, a+2d, ldots, a+1998d] where (a) is the first term and (d) is the common difference. 1. **Non-prime elements in the sequence**: Since all terms are primes, (a, a+d, a+2d, ldots, a+1998d) have to be distinct primes. Consider the term: [ a + 1998d ] This term must be a composite number because it has (1999) distinct terms. That contradict the prime numbers definition. To avoid this contradiction, we may consider other possibilities or approach for a composite sequence. 2. **Bounding (d)**: We know that each term of the progression must be a prime number less than 12345. Therefore, the highest term (a + 1998d) must also be less than 12345: [ a + 1998d < 12345 ] Because (1999a) is composite. Rearranging gives: [ 1998d < 12345 - a ] Since (a) must be a positive prime itself, the smallest possible value of (a) is 2. 3. **Estimating (d)**: [ 1998d < 12345 - 2 1998d < 12343 ] Dividing by 1998: [ d < frac{12343}{1998} approx 6.18 ] Since (d) must be an integer, it implies (d leq 6). 4. **Possible values for (d)**: - (d) must be even. If (d) were odd, then (a+d) or other terms would pair prime numbers contradict. - This leaves (d = 2, 4, ) or (6). 6. **Prime numbers modulo 3 behavior**: - Any prime number greater than 3 is congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3. - Let's take into account that mod 3 arithmetic should help to separate numbers. 7. **Considering (d = 2)**: If (d = 2), the sequence becomes (a, a+2, a+4, ldots, a+3996). - Since (a) is congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3, then: - If (a equiv 1 pmod{3}), then (a+4 equiv 2 pmod{3}) - If (a equiv 2 pmod{3}), then (a+2 equiv 1 pmod{3}) One of these terms is divisible by 3, thus a contradiction. 8. **When (d=4)**: The numbers are repeated or proceed similar fashion. 9. **Considering (d=6)**: - Primes sequence can't stand existence of such sequence at least one not depend on proofing integer arithmetic. 9. **Conclusion**: Every arithmetic progression length of 1999 primes less than 12345 is impossible because they conflict modulo 3 conditions, leaving impossible arithmetic sequences.

The power of a point ( P ) with respect to a circle (Gamma) of radius ( R ) and center ( O ) is given by ( text{Pow}(P, Gamma) = |PO|^2 - R^2 ). 2. **Radical Axes Intersection**: - Consider the three circles (Gamma_1), (Gamma_2) and (Gamma_3). - Let (Delta_1) be the radical axis of (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2). - Let (Delta_2) be the radical axis of (Gamma_2) and (Gamma_3). - Let (Delta_3) be the radical axis of (Gamma_3) and (Gamma_1). 3. **Existence of Intersection Point**: - Consider the point of intersection of (Delta_1) and (Delta_2), say ( P ). By definition, ( P ) is on both (Delta_1) and (Delta_2). - Hence, ( P ) has equal power with respect to (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2) (from being on (Delta_1)), and with respect to (Gamma_2) and (Gamma_3) (from being on (Delta_2)). Therefore, [ text{Pow}(P, Gamma_1) = text{Pow}(P, Gamma_2) = text{Pow}(P, Gamma_3) ] 4. **Conclusion for (Delta_3)**: - Since ( P ) has the same power with respect to all three circles, ( P ) must also lie on the radical axis (Delta_3). This shows that (Delta_1), (Delta_2), and (Delta_3) must either: - All pass through the same point ( P ) (i.e., they are concurrent), or - Be coincident, in which case (Delta_1 = Delta_2 = Delta_3), or - Be parallel. In this case, since parallel lines do not intersect and their properties with respect to the power of points imply the third axis is also parallel to them. # Conclusion The radical axes of the three circles (Gamma_1), (Gamma_2), and (Gamma_3) are either coincident, concurrent, or parallel. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f the radius of a circle is increased by 12 % , then the area of the circle","completion":"If the radius of a circle is increased by 12%, the new radius will be 112% of the original radius.

For ( S = {0, 1} ), we can take ( r = 1 ). These subsets trivially satisfy the given conditions. 2. **Condition 1 Analysis**: The first condition states that if ( a, b in S ), then ( ab in S ). This implies that ( S setminus {0} ) must be closed under multiplication. Since ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ) (the multiplicative group of nonzero elements modulo ( p )) is a finite group, ( S setminus {0} ) must be a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ). 3. **Existence of 1 in ( S )**: Since ( S setminus {0} ) is a subgroup of ( (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times ), it must contain the identity element, which is 1. Therefore, ( 1 in S ). 4. **Condition 2 Analysis**: The second condition states that there exists an ( r in S ) such that for all ( a in S ), ( r - a in S cup {0} ). This implies that the map ( a mapsto r - a ) is a bijection from ( S setminus {0, r} ) to itself. 5. **Sum of Elements in ( S )**: Let ( r ) be as in condition 2. By the bijection property, we have: [ sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} (r - a) ] This simplifies to: [ sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = mr - sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a ] where ( m = #(S setminus {0, r}) ). Therefore: [ 2 sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = mr ] If ( r notin S ), then: [ sum_{a in S setminus {0, r}} a = sum_{a in S} a = 0 ] which implies: [ mr = 0 ] Since ( 0 < m < p ), we must have ( r = 0 ).

Let's assume the original sum of money is P. After one year, the money will increase by 50% of P, which is 0.50P. So, the total amount after one year will be the original sum plus the interest, which is P + 0.50P = 1.50P. Since the interest is compounded annually, in the second year, the interest will be calculated on the new amount, which is 1.50P. Again, the money will increase by 50% of the new amount, which is 0.50 * 1.50P = 0.75P. So, the total amount after two years will be the amount after one year plus the interest of the second year, which is 1.50P + 0.75P = 2.25P.

This method can directly determine the total number of cells in a sample, so it is generally used for counting the number of single-cell microorganisms.

We need to prove that there exist numbers ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_{100} ) in ( S ) such that the sets [ A_j = {x + t_j mid x in A}, quad j = 1, 2, ldots, 100 ] are pairwise disjoint. 2. **Assume the contrary:** Suppose that it is not possible to find such ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_{100} ). This means that for any choice of ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_{100} ), there will always be some overlap between the sets ( A_j ). 3. **Define the sets and intersections:** Let ( mathcal{L} = A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_X ) where ( X ) is the maximum number of sets that can be pairwise disjoint. If ( X < 100 ), then for any ( t_{X+1} ), the set ( A_{X+1} ) will intersect with at least one of the sets in ( mathcal{L} ). 4. **Count the intersections:** Each set ( A_i ) has 101 elements. If ( A_{X+1} cap A_i neq varnothing ) for some ( i in {1, 2, ldots, X} ), then there are at least 101 intersections because each element in ( A ) shifted by ( t_{X+1} ) will intersect with an element in ( A_i ). 5. **Calculate the total number of intersections:** For each ( t_{X+1} ) that is not equal to any ( t_i ) for ( i in {1, 2, ldots, X} ), there is at least one intersection. Since there are ( 10^6 - X ) possible values for ( t_{X+1} ) that are not equal to any ( t_i ), we have at least ( 10^6 - X ) intersections. Additionally, for each ( t_{X+1} = t_i ), there are 101 intersections. Thus, the total number of intersections is at least: [ 10^6 - X + 101X ] 6. **Upper bound on intersections:** Since each of the ( 101X ) elements in ( mathcal{L} ) can intersect with an element in ( A_{X+1} ) at most 101 times, the upper bound on the number of intersections is: [ 101^2 times X = 10201X ] 7. **Contradiction:** For ( X le 99 ), the total number of intersections is: [ 99 times 10201 = 1009899 < 1009900 ] which is the same as: [ 10^6 - 99 + 101 times 99 ] This gives us a contradiction because the number of intersections cannot be less than the total number of elements in ( S ).

Clearly, for ( n = 3, 4, 5 ), any combination of three elements will suffice. The total number of 3-element subsets from an ( n )-element set is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{3} ). Therefore, when ( n leqslant 5 ), the maximum ( k ) is: [ k = binom{n}{3} ] 2. **Case 2: ( n geqslant 6 )** For ( n geqslant 6 ), let ( M = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} ). - **Lower bound for ( k ):** Consider the subsets containing a specific element, say ( a_1 ).

The number of such subsets is: [ binom{n-1}{2} ] Since these subsets all contain ( a_1 ), any pair of these subsets will have ( a_1 ) in their intersection, thus satisfying the problem's intersection condition. So, we have: [ k geqslant binom{n-1}{2} ] - **Upper bound for ( k ):** Suppose there are ( t ) such 3-element subsets ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_t} ). To find an upper bound, consider the permutations of the ( n )-element set. Each permutation is a circular arrangement (or cycle) of ( n ) elements, and there are ( (n-1)! ) such arrangements. For a particular subset ( A_i = {a_{i1}, a_{i2}, a_{i3}} ), the number of circular arrangements where the three elements are adjacent is: [ 3!(n-3)! ] Hence, if we sum over all ( t ) subsets, we get: [ S = t cdot 3!(n-3)! ] Every circular arrangement can accommodate at most 3 such overlapping triplets (since more than 3 would violate the non-empty intersection property). Thus, we have: [ S leqslant 3 cdot (n-1)! ] Combining these results, we obtain: [ t cdot 3!(n-3)! leqslant 3 cdot (n-1)! ] Solving for ( t ), we get: [ t leqslant frac{3 cdot (n-1)!}{3! cdot (n-3)!} = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = binom{n-1}{2} ] Hence, the maximum ( k ) is: [ k = binom{n-1}{2} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ k = begin{cases} binom{n}{3}, & text{if } n leqslant 5 binom{n-1}{2}, & text{if } n geqslant 6 end{cases} } ]"},{"prompt":"Given that a and b are any nonzero real numbers.

This implies the area under f(2x-1) from x=0 to x=2.5 would still cover the same range as f(x) from x=0.5 to x=5 due to the horizontal compression affecting the limits of integration.

If we had fewer lines, we wouldn't be able to guarantee all points (especially those on the boundary) get intersected given the constraints that none of these lines can be parallel to the sides of the square. 7. **Proof of Minimality:** - Consider centers of unit squares positioned along the perimeter of the bigger square. Any line not parallel to the grid can intersect at most two points on the boundary per side, requiring at least ( frac{36}{2} = 18 ) intercepts for the 36 boundary points, confirming that at least these many lines are necessary. # Conclusion: boxed{18}"},{"prompt":"A shop stocked 22 pairs of largesize shoes, 50 pairs of mediumsize shoes, and 24 pairs of smallsize shoes.

Specifically, we can make the first row and column of the matrix (1, 0, 0, ldots, 0) by appropriate row and column operations. This reduction is possible because the determinant is non-zero, ensuring that there is at least one non-zero element in the first row and column. 4. **Algorithmic Approach:** We simplify each column from left to right. If the first column has a non-zero element, we make it (1, 0, 0, ldots, 0). Otherwise, it is (0, 0, 0, ldots, 0). This process can be repeated for each column, reducing the problem to smaller subproblems. 5. **Counting Classes:** At each step, we split into two cases: either we can make the column (0, 1, 0, 0, ldots, 0) or it is (x, 0, 0, ldots, 0) for some (x). Each final case represents (p^x) classes, with one overcount. 6. **General Equation:** The general equation for the number of classes is complex, but we only need to consider the cases when (p = 0, 1).

Substituting a = 2 and b = -4 into this formula gives us: [ x = -frac{-4}{2 cdot 2} = -frac{-4}{4} = 1 ] This means the axis of symmetry is the line x = 1, not x = 2. Therefore, option B is incorrect. 3. **Ordinate of the Vertex**: The vertex of a parabola given by y = ax^2 + bx + c can be found by substituting the x-coordinate of the vertex into the equation. We've already found the x-coordinate of the vertex to be 1. Substituting x = 1 into the equation gives us: [ y = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) - 1 = 2 - 4 - 1 = -3 ] This means the ordinate (y-coordinate) of the vertex is -3. Therefore, option C is correct. 4. **Behavior When x < 0**: Since the parabola opens upwards and the axis of symmetry is x = 1, when x < 1, the function value decreases as x increases. This statement does not directly relate to the options provided but supports our analysis.

Let's try to find a relationship between the sum and the result. For the first operation: 2 + 3 = 5, but the result is 8, which is 5 multiplied by some number to get 8. For the second operation (which we need to find): 4 + 5 = 9, and the result is 32. If we look for a multiplication factor, 9 * 4 = 36, which is close but not correct. However, if we subtract 4 from 36, we get 32, which is the result. For the third operation: 5 + 8 = 13, and the result is 60. If we multiply 13 by 5, we get 65, and if we subtract 5, we get 60. For the fourth operation: 6 + 7 = 13, and the result is 72. If we multiply 13 by 6, we get 78, and if we subtract 6, we get 72. For the fifth operation: 7 + 8 = 15, and the result is 98. If we multiply 15 by 7, we get 105, and if we subtract 7, we get 98. From these observations, it seems that the pattern involves multiplying the sum of the two numbers by the first number and then subtracting the first number from the result.

This implies ( f(p) = 0 ). 4. **Uniqueness of the positive root ( p ):** To show that ( p ) is the only positive root, note that ( F(x) ) is strictly decreasing on ( (0, +infty) ). This is because: [ F'(x) = -left( frac{b_1}{x^2} + frac{2b_2}{x^3} + ldots + frac{nb_n}{x^{n+1}} right) < 0 ] for ( x > 0 ). Therefore, ( F(x) ) is strictly decreasing, and hence ( F(x) = 0 ) has exactly one solution in ( (0, +infty) ). 5. **Simplicity of the root ( p ):** To show that ( p ) is a simple root, we compute the derivative ( f'(x) ): [ f'(x) = n x^{n-1} - (n-1) b_1 x^{n-2} - (n-2) b_2 x^{n-3} - ldots - b_{n-1} ] Evaluating at ( x = p ): [ f'(p) = n p^{n-1} - (n-1) b_1 p^{n-2} - (n-2) b_2 p^{n-3} - ldots - b_{n-1} ] Since ( F'(p) < 0 ), it follows that ( f'(p) neq 0 ), thus ( p ) is a simple root. 6. **Bound on the absolute value of any root:** Assume ( x_0 ) is any root of ( f(x) ). Let ( q = |x_0| ). We need to show ( q leq p ). Suppose ( q > p ).

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist five consecutive interesting numbers. Let these numbers be ( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 ). 2. Consider the binary representation of these numbers. For any integer ( n ), the number of 1's in the binary representation of ( n ) is denoted by ( E(n) ). 3. Among any four consecutive integers, one of them will be congruent to ( 1 pmod{4} ). Let ( a ) be such a number. Then, among five consecutive integers, we will have ( a equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( a+1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ). 4. Since ( E(a) = E(a+1) ) (because adding 1 to a number does not change the number of 1's in its binary representation if the number is not a power of 2), the same number ( E(a) ) must divide both ( a ) and ( a+1 ). 5. For ( E(a) ) to divide both ( a ) and ( a+1 ), ( E(a) ) must be 1. This is because if ( E(a) ) were greater than 1, it could not divide two consecutive numbers. 6. If ( E(a) = 1 ), then ( a ) must be a power of 2 (since only powers of 2 have exactly one 1 in their binary representation). However, ( a equiv 1 pmod{4} ) implies that ( a ) is of the form ( 4k + 1 ). 7. The only power of 2 that fits this form is ( a = 1 ). This yields the numbers being ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ). 8. However, ( E(3) = 2 ), and 2 does not divide 3. This contradicts our assumption that there are five consecutive interesting numbers. Therefore, there cannot be five consecutive interesting numbers.

Firstly, by the properties of a triangle and the midline theorem, overline{DF}|overline{BE} and overline{DB}|overline{FE}. Since angle DBE is a right angle, quadrilateral DFEB forms a rectangle. Given that 2BE = BC = AB = 2DB, it follows that BE = DB, which implies that DFEB is not just a rectangle but a square. Let's denote the side length of the square DFEB as 2x. Consequently, the sides of triangle ABC, which are AB and BC, would each measure 4x. The segments FG and FH, being halves of the sides of the square DFEB, would each have a length of x. The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}.

The characteristic equation for this recurrence relation is: [ r^2 = r + 1 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we get the roots: [ r = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ] Let ( alpha = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( beta = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ). The general solution to the recurrence relation is: [ x_n = C_1 alpha^n + C_2 beta^n ] where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are constants determined by the initial conditions ( x_0 = A ) and ( x_1 = B ). 3. **Determine constants ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ):** Using the initial conditions: [ x_0 = A = C_1 + C_2 ] [ x_1 = B = C_1 alpha + C_2 beta ] Solving these equations for ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ), we get: [ C_1 = frac{B - A beta}{alpha - beta} ] [ C_2 = frac{A alpha - B}{alpha - beta} ] 4. **Behavior of the sequence:** Since ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are the roots of the characteristic equation, we know that ( alpha ) is positive and greater than 1, while ( beta ) is negative and its absolute value is less than 1. Therefore, as ( n ) increases, ( alpha^n ) grows exponentially, while ( beta^n ) decays exponentially to zero. 5. **Repeated values:** To have repeated values, we need ( x_t = x_s ) for some ( t neq s ). This implies: [ C_1 alpha^t + C_2 beta^t = C_1 alpha^s + C_2 beta^s ] Rearranging, we get: [ C_1 (alpha^t - alpha^s) = C_2 (beta^s - beta^t) ] Since ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are irrational and their powers grow or decay exponentially, this equation can only hold for finitely many pairs ((t, s)). 6. **Finite repeated values:** By choosing appropriate values of ( A ) and ( B ), we can ensure that the sequence has as many repeated values as desired. For example, if we choose ( A = 0 ) and ( B = 1 ), the sequence will be the standard Fibonacci sequence, which does not have repeated values. However, by choosing other values, we can create sequences with repeated values. 7. **Backward sequence:** Consider defining the sequence backwards using the same recurrence relation. For example, if we start with ( F_0 = 1 ) and ( F_1 = 1 ), we can generate negative indices: [ F_{-1} = F_1 - F_0 = 0 ] [ F_{-2} = F_0 - F_{-1} = 1 ] [ F_{-3} = F_{-1} - F_{-2} = -1 ] [ F_{-4} = F_{-2} - F_{-3} = 2 ] [ F_{-5} = F_{-3} - F_{-4} = -3 ] [ F_{-6} = F_{-4} - F_{-5} = 5 ] [ F_{-7} = F_{-5} - F_{-6} = -8 ] [ F_{-8} = F_{-6} - F_{-7} = 13 ] We observe that ( F_{-2} = F_0 ), ( F_{-4} = F_2 ), ( F_{-6} = F_4 ), ( F_{-8} = F_6 ), and so on. This shows that we can have repeated values at negative indices. 8. **Conclusion:** By choosing appropriate initial values ( A ) and ( B ), we can construct a sequence with as many repeated values as desired, but the sequence cannot have infinitely many repeated values due to the exponential growth and decay properties of ( alpha^n ) and ( beta^n ).

The actual discount given on the selling price would then be frac{x}{100} times 5 yuan. 4. **Calculate the new selling price after discount**: The new selling price after applying the discount would be 5 - frac{x}{100} times 5 = 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) yuan. 5. **Set up the inequality for the profit margin**: The profit after the discount, which is the new selling price minus the cost price, must be at least 0.4 yuan. So, 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 geq 0.4. 6. **Solve the inequality for x**: - Simplify the inequality: 5 - 5 times frac{x}{100} - 4 geq 0.4 - Further simplification gives: 1 - frac{5x}{100} geq 0.4 - This simplifies to: 0.6 geq frac{5x}{100} - Solving for x gives: x leq frac{0.6 times 100}{5} = 12 7. **Interpret the result**: Since the question asks for the maximum discount rate that can be offered without reducing the profit margin below 10%, and our calculation shows that x must be less than or equal to 12, the maximum discount rate that can be offered is 12%. Therefore, the corrected and detailed step-by-step solution concludes with the final answer encapsulated as requested: [ boxed{x = 12} ] This means the item can be discounted by a maximum of 12% to maintain at least a 10% profit margin, correcting the initial solution's oversight."},{"prompt":"one family, there were many children.

If the number of stones in the bag is odd, the player must take one stone. The objective of the game is to take the last stone. Determine for which values of n Ana has a winning strategy.","completion":"To determine for which values of n Ana has a winning strategy, let's analyze the game rules and other possible scenarios step-by-step: 1. **Initial Observations**: - For n=1: Ana takes the last (and only) stone and wins. - For n=2: Ana may take 1 stone, leaving 1 stone to Bernardo, who will then take the last stone and win. Thus, Ana loses. - For n=3: Ana takes 1 stone, leaving 2 stones. Now it is Bernardo's turn: - If Bernardo takes 1 stone, then Ana wins by taking the last stone. - If Bernardo takes both stones, he wins. But he can't take both stones because the only allowed move for n=2 is to take 1 stone. Therefore, Ana wins for n=3. 2. **Cases Where n > 3**: - **Even n > 3**: Suppose n = 2k where k > 1. - Ana can take 1 stone, leaving 2k - 1 stones for Bernardo. - 2k - 1 is an odd number (which forces Bernardo to take 1 stone). - After Bernardo's turn, we have 2k - 2 stones, which is even. - Ana continues to take 1 stone each turn, converting the stone count on her turn to be even and forcing Bernardo to play on odd stone counts. Therefore, Ana can always reduce the number of stones to 4 in her turn. - When there are 4 stones: - Ana takes 2 stones (half of 4), leaving 2 stones for Bernardo. - Bernardo must take 1 stone, leaving 1 stone for Ana. - Ana takes the last stone and wins. - **Odd n > 3**: - Ana must take exactly 1 stone, leaving n-1 stones which are even. - Bernardo can then reduce this number effectively by half or take another stone, leaving Ana in a situation to handle an odd number of stones where she may not have as controlled strategy. Therefore, from the previous analysis: 1. Odd values greater than 3 do not benefit Ana as Bernardo can reduce them to an even favorable value for him. 2. Even values greater than 3 ensure Ana's strategy to consistently make forced odd reduction on Bernardo's turn. # Conclusion: Ana has a winning strategy for n = 1, 3, and all even integers n > 3 ('n=4 and upwards').

For the first deposit, it earns interest for 12 months; the second deposit earns interest for 11 months, and so on, until the twelfth deposit, which earns interest for 1 month.

Step-by-Step Derivation: 1. **Base Case (mathbf{P_1})**: For the first week, ( A ) is used by definition. Hence, [ P_1 = 1. ] 2. **Recurrence Relation**: Consider the probability for the ((k+1))-th week given the probabilities up to the ( k )-th week. Since there are 3 other passwords to be considered equally in each week, if ( A ) is not used in the ( k )-th week, the recurrence relation is: [ P_{k+1} = frac{1}{3} (1 - P_k). ] 3. **Transform into a Standard Form**: Let's manipulate the recurrence relation to make it more manageable.

Substituting (y = sqrt{frac{3}{5}} (x - c)) into the hyperbola equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), we get: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{left( sqrt{frac{3}{5}}(x - c) right)^2}{b^2} = 1 ] Simplifying inside the second fraction: [ frac{left( sqrt{frac{3}{5}}(x - c) right)^2}{b^2} = frac{3}{5} cdot frac{(x-c)^2}{b^2} ] Now the equation becomes: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{3}{5} cdot frac{(x - c)^2}{b^2} = 1 ] 4.

According to the properties of the medians in a right triangle, we have: [ frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = a^2 ] and [ x^2 + frac{y^2}{4} = b^2 ] These equations come from the fact that in a right triangle with legs ( x ) and ( y ), the median to the hypotenuse has length ( frac{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{2} ) and the medians to the legs split the legs into two segments each, forming smaller right triangles within. 3.

Petya, as the first player, splits this stick into two parts. Since there cannot be a triangle with only two sticks, Petya can't win on his first move. 4. **Moves Analysis and the Symmetric Strategy**: - Every time a stick is broken, two new sticks are produced. After Petya's first move, there are 2 sticks. - No triangle can form with 2 sticks either. - Therefore, the next time Vasya breaks a stick, we would have 3 sticks. This is the first instance when all three sticks could, potentially, form a triangle. 5. **Ensuring Non-Triangular Condition**: - After Petya's first move, the sticks are of lengths (a), (b), such that (a + b =) the original stick. - Vasya's turn is next. He will break either (a) or (b). Suppose Vasya breaks (a) into (a_1) and (a_2) such that (a_1 + a_2 = a). - Now we have a total of 3 sticks. 6. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: - For any three sticks to form a triangle, the length of any one stick must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sticks. - If the original stick is broken evenly, no set of three sticks will form a valid triangle owing to the triangle inequality theorem. 7. **Symmetric Strategy for Petya**: - Petya's subsequent strategy should be to replicate Vasya's move symmetrically. - For every stick that Vasya breaks, Petya should break the other stick of the same length symmetrically. 8. **Formation of Equal Length Pairs**: - By following this symmetric strategy, Petya ensures that the resultant sticks form pairs of equal lengths. - Let's assume sticks of lengths (a), (b), and (c) such that (a geq b geq c). - Petya can then ensure that no valid combination of three unequal sticks exists that meets the conditions for forming a triangle. 9. **Ensuring Three Equal Lengths**: - Eventually, Petya can form two equal pairs like (a, a,x) and (b, b, x). 10. **Winning Condition from Symmetric Strategy**: - Structurally, after Petya's symmetric play, there always exists a way to create non-triangular conditions thus preventing Vasya from winning. - By controlling the stick lengths and their symmetric replication, Petya ensures that once it is his turn to move, he can always avoid the possibility for Vasya to win within the game constraints. # Conclusion Thus, the first player, Petya, using a symmetric strategy of replicating Vasya’s break pattern, can ensure his victory by preventing Vasya from ever meeting the triangle-formation condition.

This is because the games are distinct and must alternate between days. 5. **Selecting Independent Set:** - To select teams such that no two of them have played against each other, we can take advantage of the even-length cycles. - From each cycle, we choose every second vertex (i.e., every alternate vertex) to form our set. - Since each cycle has an even number of vertices, choosing every second vertex will always result in a non-adjacent set of vertices (teams) from each cycle. 6. **Counting Selected Teams:** - Given there are 20 teams in total and thus 20 vertices, and since the graph consists solely of cycles: - If we pick half of the vertices (every second vertex) from each cycle, we are guaranteed to get exactly half of the total teams. - Hence, we will always end up selecting ( frac{20}{2} = 10 ) teams. # Conclusion: We have shown that it is always possible to select 10 teams such that none of these teams have played against each other in the first two rounds.

Since the even digits available are 0, 4, and 6, and 0 cannot be the first digit of a four-digit number, there are two cases to consider: 1. **The last digit is 0**: The first digit can be chosen from 3, 5, 7, which gives 3 options. The remaining two digits can be chosen from the remaining four digits (excluding the first digit and 0), which gives 4 times 3 = 12 options. So, there are 3 times 12 = 36 numbers in this case. 2. **The last digit is 4 or 6**: There are 2 options for the last digit. The first digit can be chosen from 3, 5, 7, which gives 3 options. The remaining two digits can be chosen from the remaining four digits (excluding the first digit and the chosen even digit), which gives 4 times 3 = 12 options.

(1) What is the minimum number of alliances needed to meet these conditions? (2) If it is additionally required that the union of any two alliances contains no more than 80 countries, what is the result? Part 1 1. **Analyzing the Requirements:** - Each alliance can include at most 50 countries. - Any two countries must belong to at least one common alliance. - We need to find the minimum number of such alliances. 2. **Initial Calculation:** Each country needs to be in an alliance with every other country, so every country needs to interact with 99 other countries. In any given alliance, each country can only directly interact with 49 other countries (since an alliance can have at most 50 countries). 3. **Minimum Alliances Needed per Country:** [ text{Each country needs to be in alliances with } 99 text{ countries.} ] Since a single alliance can accommodate only 49 interactions per country: [ 49 text{ countries per alliance means each country must be in at least } lceil frac{99}{49} rceil = 3 text{ alliances.} ] 4. **Total Alliances Calculation:** To generalize, with 100 countries, each country needs to be in 3 alliances, as determined by: [ frac{3 times 100}{50} = 6 text{ alliances needed.} ] 5. **Verification by Partition:** We can partition the 100 countries into 4 groups, each containing 25 countries.

For ( N = p ), the sum of the squares of the divisors is ( 1^2 + p^2 = 1 + p^2 ), which is not equal to ( p(p+3) ).

For ( p ), we have: [ p^2 - 3pq + q^2 + 1 = 0 ] The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square: [ Delta = 9q^2 - 4(q^2 + 1) = 5q^2 - 4 ] For ( Delta ) to be a perfect square, ( 5q^2 - 4 ) must be a perfect square. It is a well-known fact that this happens only when ( q ) is a Fibonacci number.

Given: P = 5,000 r = 4% per year = 0.04 (as a decimal) n = 4 (since the interest is compounded quarterly) t = 0.5 years (since we are calculating for 6 months) Now we can plug these values into the formula: A = 5000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*0.5) First, calculate the rate per period (r/n): 0.04/4 = 0.01 Now, calculate the number of periods (nt): 4 * 0.5 = 2 Now we can calculate A: A = 5000(1 + 0.01)^2 A = 5000(1.01)^2 A = 5000 * 1.0201 A = 5100.5 So, the amount of money in the account 6 months after the account was opened is boxed{5,100.50} ."},{"prompt":"Given the expansion of the expression ((x+ frac{a}{ sqrt {x}})^{6}), the constant term is 15.

Given that the wheel covers a distance of 2112 cm in 1500 revolutions, we can find the distance covered in one revolution by dividing the total distance by the number of revolutions: Distance covered in one revolution = Total distance / Number of revolutions Distance covered in one revolution = 2112 cm / 1500 revolutions Distance covered in one revolution = 1.408 cm This distance is the circumference of the wheel.

This is a fundamental property of integers: the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers is even, while the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd. 2. Next, we recognize that the two integers must be divisors of (10^{10}). We can express (10^{10}) as: [ 10^{10} = (2 cdot 5)^{10} = 2^{10} cdot 5^{10} ] Therefore, any divisor of (10^{10}) can be written in the form (2^a cdot 5^b) where (0 leq a leq 10) and (0 leq b leq 10). 3. Since the sum of the two integers is 157, we denote the two integers as (2^a cdot 5^b) and (2^c cdot 5^d) such that: [ 2^a cdot 5^b + 2^c cdot 5^d = 157 ] 4. Given that the sum is odd, one of the integers must be even and the other must be odd. This implies that one of the integers must be a power of 2 (since powers of 2 are even) and the other must be a power of 5 (since powers of 5 are odd). 5. We now test possible values for (a) and (b) to find pairs that sum to 157. We start by considering the possible values for (5^b): - (5^0 = 1) - (5^1 = 5) - (5^2 = 25) - (5^3 = 125) - (5^4 = 625) (too large since (2^a) must be positive and less than 157) 6.

This gives: [ n = p_j^{a_j} m^2 ] for some ( m in mathbb{Z}^+ ). 5. **Modulo 4 Considerations**: If ( p_j equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then: [ 1 + p_j + p_j^2 + cdots + p_j^{a_j} equiv frac{3^{a_j+1} - 1}{2} pmod{4} ] Since ( 2n equiv 2 pmod{4} ), we have: [ (1 + p_j + p_j^2 + cdots + p_j^{a_j}) m^2 equiv 2 pmod{4} implies m^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] There is no even number ( u ) such that ( frac{3^u - 1}{2} equiv 2 pmod{4} ). 6. **Prime Form**: Hence, ( p_j equiv 1 pmod{4} ). This implies: [ n equiv 1 pmod{4} implies (1 + p_j + p_j^2 + cdots + p_j^{a_j}) m^2 equiv 2 pmod{4} implies 1 + a_j equiv 2 pmod{4} ] Therefore, ( a_j equiv 1 pmod{4} ), completing part (a). # Part (b) 1. **Even ( n )**: If ( n ) is even, ( n-1 ) is odd. By part (a), we get: [ n = p^a m^2 + 1 ] for some prime ( p ) and positive integers ( a, m ) with ( p, a equiv 1 pmod{4} ). Note that: [ n equiv 2 pmod{4} implies frac{n(n+1)}{2} equiv 1 pmod{2} ] So: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} = q^b ell^2 ] for some prime ( q ) and positive integers ( b, ell ) with ( q, b equiv 1 pmod{4} ). 2. **GCD Considerations**: Since ( gcdleft(frac{n}{2}, n+1right) = 1 ), one of ( frac{n}{2} ) or ( n+1 ) must be of the form ( q^b k^2 ) for some positive integer ( k ). We have: [ q^b k^2 equiv k^2 pmod{4} ] and it cannot be an even number, so: [ q^b k^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] 3. **Contradiction**: If ( n+1 = q^b k^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ), then ( n equiv 0 pmod{4} ), which is impossible. So: [ frac{n}{2} = q^b k^2 implies n+1 = v^2 = p^a m^2 + 2 ] for some positive integer ( v ). Considering the equation modulo 4 gives a contradiction. 4. **Odd ( n )**: If ( n ) is odd, ( n-1 ) is even. We get: [ n-1 = 2^p (2^{p+1} - 1) ] for some positive integer ( p ) such that ( 2^{p+1} - 1 ) is a prime number. If ( p geq 2 ), we have: [ n equiv 1 pmod{4} implies frac{n(n+1)}{2} equiv 1 pmod{2} ] So: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} = q^b ell^2 ] for some prime ( q ) and positive integers ( b, ell ) with ( q, b equiv 1 pmod{4} ). 5. **Contradiction**: We have: [ (2^p (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1)(2^{p-1} (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1) = q^b ell^2 ] So there exists ( epsilon in {0, 1} ) such that: [ 2^{p-epsilon} (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1 = v^2 ] for some positive integer ( v ). Thus: [ 2^{p-epsilon} (2^{p+1} - 1) = (v-1)(v+1) ] Since ( 2^{p+1} - 1 ) is a prime number, ( 2(2^{p+1} - 1) ) divides one of ( v-1 ) or ( v+1 ). So: [ v geq 2(2^{p+1} - 1) + 1 ] We easily arrive at a contradiction from: [ 2^p (2^{p+1} - 1) + 1 geq v^2 geq (2(2^{p+1} - 1) + 1)^2 ] when ( p geq 2 ). 6. **Solution**: Hence, ( p = 1 ), giving ( n = 7 ). It is easy to see that this works and is the only solution to our problem. The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 7 } )"},{"prompt":"Given that the center of a hyperbola is at the origin, its foci F_1 and F_2 lie on the coordinate axes, and one of its asymptotic lines is y=x.

Since the hyperbola passes through the point (4, -sqrt{10}), substituting these coordinates into our equation gives us: frac{4^2}{a^2} - frac{(-sqrt{10})^2}{b^2} = 1, which simplifies to: 16 - 10 = a^2, leading to: a^2 = b^2 = 6. Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is: boxed{frac{x^2}{6} - frac{y^2}{6} = 1}. (2) Since point M(3,m) lies on the hyperbola, substituting x=3 into the hyperbola's equation yields: frac{3^2}{6} - frac{m^2}{6} = 1, simplifying to: m^2 = 3, and thus: m = pmsqrt{3}. There are two cases for M: M(3, sqrt{3}) or M(3, -sqrt{3}). If the foci are F_1(-sqrt{6}, 0) and F_2(sqrt{6}, 0) (calculated from a^2 = 6 and the definition of a hyperbola's foci), we can find: vec{MF_1} = (-sqrt{6} - 3, pmsqrt{3}), vec{MF_2} = (sqrt{6} - 3, pmsqrt{3}). Now, computing the dot product gives us: vec{MF_1} cdot vec{MF_2} = (-sqrt{6} - 3)(sqrt{6} - 3) + (pmsqrt{3})(pmsqrt{3}) = (-sqrt{6} - 3)(sqrt{6} - 3) + 3, = -6 - 3sqrt{6} + 3sqrt{6} + 9 + 3 = 0.

Conclusion: Thus, through a sequence of strategic water transfer steps according to the powers of 2, it is always possible to empty one of the vessels. boxed{text{We can always empty one vessel through a finite number of operations.}}"},{"prompt":"Given circle M: (x+1)^2+y^2=1, and circle N: (x1)^2+y^2=9, a moving circle P is externally tangent to circle M and internally tangent to circle N.

Now, we need to compare ( sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i y_i ) and ( sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i z_i ). By the **Rearrangement Inequality**, for non-increasing sequences ( x_i ) and ( y_i ), the sum ( sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i y_i ) is maximal if ( y_i ) are matched with ( x_i ) in the same order: [ sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i y_i geq sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i z_i ] 7.

There is a closed non-self-intersecting path such that each segment of the path connects the centers of two adjacent (sharing a face) unit cubes. We will call the faces of the unit cubes that are intersected by this path as marked. Prove that it is possible to color the edges of the unit cubes in two colors so that each marked face has an odd number of its edges in one color, and every unmarked face has an even number of its edges in the same color. Let (PQ) be a horizontal edge of one of the unit cubes. Denote by (C_{PQ}) the vertical rectangle such that the bottom edge of the rectangle is (PQ) and the top edge lies on the surface of the cube. 1. Let (n_{PQ}) be the number of intersections of the given path with the rectangle (C_{PQ}). 2. Color the edge (PQ) white if (n_{PQ}) is even, and black if (n_{PQ}) is odd. All vertical edges of the unit cubes should be colored white. 3. We need to show that this coloring satisfies the required condition: - If the path does not intersect the face (PQRS), then the rectangles (C_{PQ}) and (C_{RS}) intersect the path at the same points. Therefore, the edges (PQ) and (RS) have the same color, and such a face has an even number of black edges. - If the path intersects the face (PQRS), then (n_{PQ}) and (n_{RS}) differ by 1 and hence have different parities. Therefore, the edges (PQ) and (RS) are of different colors, ensuring an odd number of black edges on a marked face. Consider the situation where (PQRS) is a horizontal face. The union of rectangles (C_{PQ}, C_{QR}, C_{RS},) and (C_{SP}) constitutes the lateral surface of a rectangular parallelepiped made up of unit cubes. The closed path intersects this surface an even number of times (each entry and exit point of the path through the surface counts as one set of intersections). 4. Notice that the path does not intersect the top face of the parallelepiped formed by (PQRS) and the cubes directly above it. 5. If the face (PQRS) is unmarked, then the path does not intersect it. Hence, all intersections of the path with the surface of the parallelepiped are positioned on its lateral surface. 6. In this case, the sum (n_{PQ}+n_{QR}+n_{RS}+n_{SP}) is even, hence the number of black edges of the face (PQRS) is even. 7. If the face (PQRS) is marked, then one intersection point of the path lies in (PQRS). Hence, the sum (n_{PQ}+n_{QR}+n_{RS}+n_{SP}) is odd, and therefore, the number of black edges of the face (PQRS) is odd. Thus, the coloring satisfies the condition that every marked face has an odd number of edges in black color and every unmarked face has an even number of edges in black color.

Hence, the total score S is at least: [ S geq 840 + 70(n - 7) ] 3. **Relate Total Score to Mean Score:** Given the mean score of 90, the total score S can also be expressed as: [ S = 90n ] 4. **Combine and Simplify the Inequalities:** From the inequalities above, we set up the equation: [ 840 + 70(n - 7) leq 90n ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 840 + 70n - 490 leq 90n ] [ 350 leq 20n ] [ n geq frac{350}{20} = 17.5 ] Since n must be an integer, we round up, giving n geq 18. 5. **Verify Feasibility for n = 18:** If n = 18, then the total score required for a mean of 90 is: [ 90 times 18 = 1620 ] The seven top students contribute 840 points, so the remaining 11 students need to contribute: [ 1620 - 840 = 780 ] Each of these 11 students scored at least 70 points, their minimum total contribution is 770 points. To achieve exactly 780 points, it's feasible to distribute the remaining 10 points among them, ensuring each score remains at least 70. 6. **Conclusion:** The smallest possible number of students in the class, satisfying all conditions, is 18.

Pay attention to summarizing techniques for finding the range of values when solving. Knowing that neg p is a false proposition, then p is a true proposition. Thus, the original problem is transformed into a problem of solving the parameter range where the equation has solutions, generally treating the parameter as a function value, transforming it into a problem of finding the range of values to determine the correct answer. **Solution** Solving 4^{x}-2^{x+1}+m=0 gives m=-4^{x}+2^{x+1}=-(2^{x})^{2}+2times2^{x}=-(2^{x}-1)^{2}+1, Since 2^{x} > 0, hence -(2^{x}-1)^{2}+1leqslant 1, Therefore mleqslant 1, Since neg p is a false proposition, then p is a true proposition, Therefore mleqslant 1, Thus, the answer is boxed{mleqslant 1}.

Given that for every positive integer ( a ) such that ( gcd(a, n) = 1 ), we have ( n mid a^m - 1 ). This implies that ( a^m equiv 1 pmod{n} ) for all ( a ) coprime to ( n ). 2. This condition suggests that the order of any integer ( a ) modulo ( n ) divides ( m ). Let ( varphi(n) ) be the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers up to ( n ) that are coprime to ( n ). The order of any integer ( a ) modulo ( n ) must divide both ( varphi(n) ) and ( m ). 3. Since ( a^m equiv 1 pmod{n} ) for all ( a ) coprime to ( n ), it follows that the order of any such ( a ) must be a divisor of ( m ). Therefore, the least common multiple of the orders of all such ( a ) must also divide ( m ). 4. Let ( d ) be the order of ( a ) modulo ( n ). Then ( d mid m ) and ( d mid varphi(n) ). Hence, ( varphi(n) ) must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the orders of all ( a ) coprime to ( n ). 5. Since ( n mid a^m - 1 ) for all ( a ) coprime to ( n ), it follows that ( n ) must divide the product of all such ( a^m - 1 ). This implies that ( n ) must be a divisor of ( prod_{a in (mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z})^*} (a^m - 1) ). 6. The number of elements in ( (mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z})^* ) is ( varphi(n) ).

This means each digit must be adjacent to 9 other digit pairs. 3. **Vertices and Pairs Allocation**: Since the polygon has 45 vertices, in order to have each pair represented by a side of the polygon, every digit needs to appear in a certain number of vertices. 4. **Inspection of Necessary Vertices**: To ensure all pairs (a, b) can be represented by the polygon's sides, each of the 45 vertices must be allocated suitably. If we assume a digit a forms pairs with each other digit b (where b in {0, 1, ldots, 9} backslash {a}), then a must appear at least 5 vertex positions to span the pairs involving itself. 5. **Viability of Placement**: Since there are 10 digits and each must appear at least 5 times to account for the pairs, we need a minimum of 10 times 5 = 50 vertex positions. 6. **Comparison with Polygon Vertices**: The regular 45-sided polygon has only 45 vertices.

The domain of f(x) is {x | x neq 0} because the logarithmic function ln|x| is undefined at x=0. Additionally, we observe that f(-x) = f(x), which means f(x) is an even function. For x > 0, the term frac{1}{1+x^2} is monotonically decreasing because as x increases, 1+x^2 increases, making the fraction smaller. Similarly, -ln|x| (which simplifies to -ln x for x>0) is also monotonically decreasing because the natural logarithm function ln x increases with x. Therefore, f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty) and, by symmetry of being an even function, increasing on (-infty, 0). Given the inequality f(-ax + ln x + 1) + f(ax - ln x - 1) geqslant 2f(1) for x in [1,3], we deduce that 2f(ax - ln x - 1) geqslant 2f(1), which simplifies to f(ax - ln x - 1) geqslant f(1).

However, this case does not provide a valid solution for a. 3. **Case 3:** When 1 < frac{1}{a} < 3, i.e., frac{1}{3} < a < 1, g(x) first decreases then increases, with the minimum at x = frac{1}{a}.

Loan A will cost him 33,750 in total repayments, and Loan B will cost him 24,000 in total repayments.

Then, we can write: a = 2^p a_1, quad b = 2^p b_1, quad c = 2^p c_1, quad d = 2^p d_1 Substituting these into the original equation and dividing both sides by (2^{2p}), we obtain: a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2 + d_1^2 = 2^{n - 2p} Where at least one of the numbers (a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1) is odd. 3. Next, consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the numbers (a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1): - If exactly one or three of (a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1) are odd, then the sum (a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2 + d_1^2) is odd. This is impossible because (2^{n-2p}) must be even, so such combinations do not work. - If two of (a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1) are odd and two are even, assume without loss of generality that (a_1 = 2k + 1) and (b_1 = 2l + 1) are odd, while (c_1 = 2m) and (d_1 = 2n) are even. We then have: begin{aligned} a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2 + d_1^2 &= (2k + 1)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 + (2m)^2 + (2n)^2 &= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4l^2 + 4l + 1 + 4m^2 + 4n^2 &= 2 left[2(k^2 + k + l^2 + l + m^2 + n^2) + 1 right] end{aligned} This expression is odd, which contradicts the even nature of (2^{n-2p}). - If all four numbers (a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1) are odd, then: begin{aligned} a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2 + d_1^2 &= (2k + 1)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 + (2m + 1)^2 + (2n + 1)^2 &= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4l^2 + 4l + 1 + 4m^2 + 4m + 1 + 4n^2 + 4n + 1 &= 4(k^2 + k + l^2 + l + m^2 + m + n^2 + n + 1) end{aligned} Since the product of two consecutive integers (e.g., (k(k+1))) is always even, the expression inside the brackets is even. Thus, the total expression is a multiple of 4 and does not align with (2^{n-2p - 0.5}) (which might not be an integer). 4. From the above analysis, if we consider the case where (n-2p = 2): - If (n = 2p + 2), then (a_1 = b_1 = c_1 = d_1 = 1), implying: a = b = c = d = 2^p - Thus, the equation holds with (2^n = 4(2^p)^2). 5.

Let the slopes of the tangents PA and PC be k_{1} and k_{2}, respectively. Then, k_{1} and k_{2} are the two real roots of the equation, thus k_{1}+k_{2}=- frac {18x_{0}}{x_{0}^{2}-9} and k_{1}k_{2}=- frac {72}{x_{0}^{2}-9}. From begin{cases} k_{1}x-y-k_{1}x_{0}-4=0 x^{2}=20y end{cases}, we get x^{2}-20k_{1}x+20(k_{1}x_{0}+4)=0. Let the x-coordinates of points A, B, C, and D be x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, and x_{4}, respectively. Then, x_{1}, x_{2} are the two real roots of the equation, thus x_{1}x_{2}=20(k_{1}x_{0}+4). Similarly, x_{3}x_{4}=20(k_{2}x_{0}+4). From these equations, we get: x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}x_{4}=400(k_{1}x_{0}+4)(k_{2}x_{0}+4) =400[k_{1}k_{2}x_{0}^{2}+4x_{0}(k_{1}+k_{2})+16] =400 times 16=6400.

Substituting these into the given function does not lead immediately to a simpler form, so we investigate another approach. Let's work directly with the function to try to understand its periodicity.

Let's analyze (tan x tan frac{x}{2}): [ tan x quad text{has a period of} quad pi ] And [ tan frac{x}{2} quad text{has a period of} quad 2pi ] 6. Combining these, the entire term needs the smaller common period to satisfy both repeat conditions. Therefore, this function will effectively repeat after (2pi). 7.

The cashier also informed him that the initial offer applies strictly to the pair with the lowest price, and additionally, he was selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. After all of these deductions, a sales tax of 8% was applied to his bill. How much money did James end up paying for all three pairs of shoes?","completion":"Let's calculate the total cost step by step: 1. The first pair of shoes is 40, and the second pair is 60. According to the offer, he gets the second pair for half off the original price. So, the discount on the second pair is 50% of 40 (the lower-priced pair), which is 20. Therefore, the second pair costs him 60 - 20 = 40. 2. The third pair of shoes is priced at 80, and a 30% discount is applicable on that pair. So, the discount amount is 30% of 80, which is 24. Therefore, the third pair costs him 80 - 24 = 56. 3. Now, let's add up the cost of all three pairs of shoes: 40 (first pair) + 40 (second pair) + 56 (third pair) = 136. 4. James was selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. A fourth off of 136 is 136 / 4 = 34. So, the new total after the extra discount is 136 - 34 = 102. 5.

The atomic weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 g/mol. The atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol. The molecular weight of H6O2 is calculated as follows: (6 hydrogen atoms * 1.008 g/mol) + (2 oxygen atoms * 16.00 g/mol) = (6 * 1.008) + (2 * 16.00) = 6.048 + 32.00 = 38.048 g/mol Now, we know the total molecular weight of the compound is 122 g/mol. To find the weight contributed by carbon atoms, we subtract the weight of H6O2 from the total molecular weight: 122 g/mol (total molecular weight) - 38.048 g/mol (weight of H6O2) = 83.952 g/mol The atomic weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.

For a given point ( A ), all points at distance ( d ) from ( A ) lie on a circle with ( A ) as the center and radius ( d ). 3. **Angle Constraint and Configuration:** Given that no pair of points exceeds distance ( d ), the endpoints of the segments originating from ( A ) are confined to within ( 60^circ ) angles around ( A ). This is because placing more than three points at ( 60^circ ) apart would eventually necessitate a distance greater than ( d ) between some pairs. 4. **Verification with Additional Points:** Suppose point ( A ) is connected to ( B, C, ) and ( D ) via segments of length ( d ). At least one of these points, say ( C ), must fall within the ( angle B A D ).

Removing such points to revert to ( n ) leaves the same set properties.

The total probability of a bulb working for over 4000 hours is the sum of the contributions from both factories, which is given as 62% or 0.62 in decimal form. So we have: [ 0.60 times 0.59 + 0.40 times P_Y = 0.62 ] Now we can solve for ( P_Y ): [ 0.60 times 0.59 = 0.354 ] [ 0.40 times P_Y = 0.62 - 0.354 ] [ 0.40 times P_Y = 0.266 ] [ P_Y = frac{0.266}{0.40} ] [ P_Y = 0.665 ] So the percentage of cases in which Factory Y's bulbs work for over 4000 hours is boxed{66.5%} ."},{"prompt":"ABC is a triangle with angle C = 90^o .

Since AXHE is cyclic, the circumcenter of triangle AEH, which is I, will also be the circumcenter of triangle AXE. - Since triangle EAX is right, its circumcenter will lie on the hypotenuse EX, and, in particular, at the midpoint of EX. Thus, I is the midpoint of EX. 7. **Parallel Lines:** - Join FI. Since |EF| = |FC| and |EI| = |IX|, we know that frac{|EF|}{|FC|} = frac{|EI|}{|IX|} = 1. - Due to Thales' Intercept Theorem, this means that FI parallel CX. - Since FI parallel CX and EB perp CX, then FI perp EB. 8. **Perpendicular Lines:** - Join FG. Since frac{|CF|}{|FE|} = frac{|CG|}{|GB|} = 1, due to Thales' Intercept Theorem, FG parallel EB. - Then, as FI perp EB, FI perp CG; that is, angle IFG = 90^circ. 9. **Similar Triangles:** - Join GI. So far, we know that angle IFG = 90^circ. - Let H' be the foot of the perpendicular from I to AC. It is easily provable that triangle IHF sim triangle FCG (since angle HFI = 180^circ - 90^circ - angle CFG = 90^circ - angle CFG = angle CGF). - Then, frac{|IF|}{|HF|} = frac{|FG|}{|CG|}; that is, frac{|IF|}{|FG|} = frac{|HF|}{|CG|} = frac{2|HF|}{2|CG|} = frac{2|HF|}{|BC|} = frac{2|HE| + 2|EF|}{|BC|} = frac{|AH| + |HE| + |EF| + |FC|}{|BC|} = frac{|AC|}{|BC|}. - Since angle IFG = angle ACB = 90^circ, and frac{|IF|}{|FG|} = frac{|AC|}{|BC|} implies frac{|IF|}{|AC|} = frac{|FG|}{|BC|}, by SAS Similarity, triangle IGF sim triangle ABC. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given sets M={1, 0, 1, 5}, N={2, 1, 2, 5}, then M cap N equals to ( ) A: {1, 1} B: {1, 2, 5} C: {1, 5} D: varnothing","completion":"Since M={-1, 0, 1, 5}, N={-2, 1, 2, 5}, Therefore, M cap N = {1, 5}.

However, we shall combine ( x ) and ( y ) terms that need to be paired: Let's rewrite the function ( f(x,y) ) in a more convenient form by organizing the terms: [ f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + 6y^2 - 14x - 6y + 72 ] 2. **Rearrange and group** the terms to complete the square. First, for the ( x ) terms: [ x^2 - 2xy - 14x = (x - y)^2 - y^2 - 14x ] Combine ( 6y^2, -y^2 ): [ 6y^2 - y^2 = 5y^2 ] Thus the function becomes: [ f(x, y) = (x - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 14x - 6y + 72 ] 3.

It follows from the properties of circles that these two points exist at the intersection of Omega and omega. 4. **Position of Points on Arcs**: The circle Omega is divided into two arcs because it is intersected by omega at points A and B.

Here is the step-by-step detailed solution: 1. **Define Midpoint ( O ) and Center ( C ) of the Sphere:** Let ( O ) be the midpoint of ( AB ). Since ( A ) and ( B ) are points on skew lines ( L ) and ( M ) respectively with ( AB perp L ) and ( AB perp M ), the center ( C ) of the sphere must satisfy certain geometric conditions. 2. **Perpendicular Planes:** The center ( C ) lies in the plane ( pi ) that passes through ( O ) and is normal to ( AB ). Therefore, ( C ) must lie in the plane (pi). 3. **Perpendicular Bisector Condition:** The center ( C ) must also lie in the plane ( sigma ), which is normal to segment ( AP ) at its midpoint. Let’s denote the perpendicular projections of ( P ) and ( Q ) onto the plane (pi) as ( P' ) and ( Q' ). 4. **Intersection of Planes:** The plane ( sigma ) intersects the plane (pi) along the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the segment ( OP' ). Consequently, ( C ) must lie on this line ( l_1 ). 5. **Second Perpendicular Bisector:** Similarly, ( C ) must also lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment ( OQ' ), which we denote as ( l_2 ). 6. **Intersection of Bisectors:** Therefore, ( C ) must be the circumcenter of the triangle ( OP'Q' ), which is the unique point that lies both on ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). 7. **Length and Angle Properties:** Given that ( PP' = QQ' = OA ), we use the fact that: [ PQ^2 = P'Q'^2 + AB^2 ] Thus, [ P'Q' = sqrt{PQ^2 - AB^2} ] which is a fixed length as ( PQ ) is constant, and ( AB ) is fixed. 8. **Fixed Angle Analysis:** The angle ( angle P'OQ' ) is also a fixed angle. To see this, we consider lines parallel to ( L ) and ( M ) through ( O ), denoted as ( L' ) and ( M' ) respectively. These lines ( L' ) and ( M' ) lie in the plane (pi), with ( P ) lying on ( L' ) and ( Q ) lying on ( M' ). 9. **Circumradius:** The radius of the circle through ( P'OQ' ) is: [ OC = frac{P'Q'}{2 sin(angle P'OQ')} ] This value is fixed because ( P'Q' ) and ( angle P'OQ' ) are both fixed. 10. **Conclusion:** Because the center ( C ) must lie on the perpendicular bisectors that pass through the fixed angle and length properties, ( C ) must trace a fixed circle on the plane (pi) centered at ( O ), forming the circumcenter of ( OP'Q' ). Thus, the center of the sphere through ( A, B, P, Q ) lies on a fixed circle whose center is the midpoint ( O ) of ( AB ).

For the parallel sides: - The first parallel side measures 60 meters. Poles are placed 5 meters apart. To find the number of poles, we divide the length of the side by the interval between poles and add 1 (for the starting pole): Number of poles on the first parallel side = (60 / 5) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 poles - The second parallel side measures 80 meters. Using the same method: Number of poles on the second parallel side = (80 / 5) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 poles For the non-parallel sides: - Both non-parallel sides measure 50 meters each. Poles are placed 7 meters apart. To find the number of poles, we divide the length of the side by the interval between poles and add 1 (for the starting pole): Number of poles on each non-parallel side = (50 / 7) + 1 However, since we cannot have a fraction of a pole, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because we need a pole at each end of the side. So we use the ceiling function to round up the result. Number of poles on each non-parallel side = ceil(50 / 7) + 1 = ceil(7.14) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 poles Since there are two non-parallel sides, we multiply the number of poles by 2: Total number of poles on non-parallel sides = 9 * 2 = 18 poles Now, we sum up the poles from all sides: Total number of poles = 13 (first parallel side) + 17 (second parallel side) + 18 (non-parallel sides) Total number of poles = 13 + 17 + 18 Total number of poles = 48 poles However, we must consider that at each corner of the trapezoid, we have counted a pole twice (once for each side that meets at that corner).

This is because parallelism is transitive among vectors. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B**: Given overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{a} neq 0, by the definition of vector parallelism, there must exist a unique real number lambda such that overrightarrow{b} = lambda overrightarrow{a}. This is a direct application of the collinearity theorem for vectors. Hence, statement B is correct. **Statement C**: From the equation overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c} = overrightarrow{b} cdot overrightarrow{c}, we can deduce that (overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}) cdot overrightarrow{c} = 0. This implies that the vector overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{c}. However, perpendicularity does not imply that overrightarrow{a} = overrightarrow{b}. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. **Statement D**: Starting with |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}| = 4, we square both sides to get (overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b})^2 = 16. Expanding the left side gives {overrightarrow{a}}^2 - 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + {overrightarrow{b}}^2 = 16. Substituting overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 1 into the equation, we obtain {overrightarrow{a}}^2 + {overrightarrow{b}}^2 - 2 = 16. Adding 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2 to both sides to form the square of the sum gives {overrightarrow{a}}^2 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + {overrightarrow{b}}^2 = 18 + 2. Therefore, |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 20, and taking the square root gives |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{20} = 2sqrt{5}.

Consider ( n = m ). Then the condition is ( 2a_n ) divisible by ( gcd(n, n) = n ), implying ( a_n ) must be divisible by ( n ), or ( a_n vdots n ). For ( n geq 1013 ), ( a_n ) must equal ( n ) since each ( a_n ) is an element of ( S ), and thus the only number greater than or equal to 1013 that divides ( n ) is ( n ) itself.

For even ( n ) and ( m ), ( a_n ) and ( a_m ) must have the same parity (either all even or all odd numbers). Since we know ( n in {1013, 1015, ldots, 2021} ) are already determined to be equal to their respective indices, this indicates that all ( a_{n} ) for ( n ) odd must be odd and similarly all ( a_{n} ) for ( n ) even must be even. 4.

From the previous result ( a_{n} vdots n ), and larger odd number ( k ) already determined, we conclude that ( a_k ) should be ( k ). Thus, this same process applies for every odd ( k ) reducing to ( a_k = k ). 5. Now consider the even indexed ( a_{2n} ) corresponding to the permutation of even numbers ( {2, 4, 6, ldots, 2022} ). Let ( a_{2n} = 2b_n ) and ( a_{2m} = 2b_m ) where ( 1 leq n, m leq 1011 ).

We need to prove that the quadrilateral (A'B'C'D'), formed by the intersections of tangents to (Omega) at (A, B, C, D) and their respective Feuerbach points, is similar to (ABCD). 2. **Feuerbach Points and Tangents:** Let (F_A) be the Feuerbach point associated with the triangle formed by the tangents to (Omega) at (B, C, D). Similarly, define (F_B, F_C, F_D). The point (A') is the intersection of the tangents to (Omega) at (A) and (F_A).

Since the trip is long, Biff will also have to find accommodation for one night, which will cost him 35 before taxes. Taxes on the accommodation are 10% of the cost. Taking into account the fluctuating WiFi prices, connection fees, food, accommodations, and taxes, how many hours long will the bus ride need to be for him to break even?","completion":"First, let's calculate Biff's total expenses for the trip: 1.

Since we don't know how long the trip is or what time it starts, we can't calculate the exact cost of WiFi. However, we know there is a one-time connection fee of 5. Total expenses including WiFi connection fee = 86.50 + 5 = 91.50 Biff makes 12/hour working online. To break even, he needs to earn at least 91.50.

Since the cost of WiFi varies throughout the day, we need to consider the best-case scenario (cheapest WiFi cost) to minimize the number of hours Biff needs to work to break even. The cheapest WiFi cost is 1/hour at night. If Biff works during the night when WiFi is 1/hour, he will have to pay an additional 1 for each hour he works. Therefore, for each hour he works, he earns 12 but has to pay 1 for WiFi, effectively earning 11/hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to cover the 91.50 at an effective rate of 11/hour, we divide the total expenses by the effective hourly rate: 91.50 / 11/hour = 8.318 hours Biff needs to work approximately 8.318 hours to break even on his expenses, including the cheapest WiFi cost. Since he can't work a fraction of an hour, we'll round up to the nearest whole hour, which is 9 hours.

Hence, we need to focus on the exponent of -1: [ (-1)^{1-m} = 1 ] For (-1)^{1-m} to be 1, 1-m must be an even integer, because (-1) raised to an even power equals 1 and to an odd power equals -1.

Since c is odd, at^{2}+bt+c would be odd, which contradicts the assumption that at^{2}+bt+c=0. Hence, there can't be an integer root when a and b are both even. - **Case 2:** If a and b are both odd numbers, let's consider two sub-cases based on the parity of t: - Sub-case 2.1: If t is an even number, then at^{2} and bt are both even.

Hence, a^2 + b^2 = 4b^2, which simplifies to a^2 = 3b^2.

This implies ln x > 1-frac{1}{x} for x > 0 and xneq 1. Applying this result, ln 0.9 > 1-frac{1}{0.9}=-frac{1}{9}, which leads to -ln 0.9 < frac{1}{9}. Therefore, we have c < b. Since -ln 0.9=ln frac{10}{9} > 1-frac{9}{10}=frac{1}{10}, it follows that frac{10}{9} > e^{0.1}, which implies 0.1e^{0.1} < frac{1}{9}. Hence, we establish that a < b. Next, consider g(x)=xe^{x}+ln(1-x) for 0 < x < 1. The derivative is g'(x)=(x+1)e^{x}+frac{1}{x-1}. Define h(x)=e^{x}(x^{2}-1)+1 with its derivative h'(x)=e^{x}(x^{2}+2x-1). For 0 < x < sqrt{2}-1, h'(x) < 0, making h(x) monotonically decreasing. For sqrt{2}-1 < x < 1, h'(x) > 0, making h(x) monotonically increasing. Since h(0)=0, for 0 < x < sqrt{2}-1, h(x) < 0. Thus, for 0 < x < sqrt{2}-1, g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x)=xe^{x}+ln(1-x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, g(0.1) > g(0)=0, which implies 0.1e^{0.1} > -ln 0.9, so a > c. Combining these results, we conclude c < a < b. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"Given the function y=f(x), if we keep the ordinate of each point on the graph of f(x) unchanged, expand the abscissa to twice its original size, and then shift the resulting graph to the left along the xaxis by frac{pi }{4} units, the resulting curve is the same as the graph of y=3sin x.

Step-by-step Proof: 1. **Inversion Transformation**: - Consider the center of inversion that maps ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) into concentric circles. The center of this inversion lies on the line connecting the centers of ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ). (Refer to the solution of problem (underline{28.6})). - Now, by performing this inversion, we note that the angle between the circles and their tangency are preserved.

To find the exact location of C, we use the fact that points A(-1, 4) and B(1, 2) lie on the circle, meaning the distances from C to A and C to B must be equal (since both are radii of the circle): - Distance from C to A: sqrt{(a+1)^2 + (1-a-4)^2} = sqrt{(a+1)^2 + (2-a)^2} - Distance from C to B: sqrt{(a-1)^2 + (1-a-2)^2} = sqrt{(a-1)^2 + (-1-a)^2} Setting these equal to each other: sqrt{(a+1)^2 + (2-a)^2} = sqrt{(a-1)^2 + (-1-a)^2} Solving this equation for a gives a = -1. Thus, the coordinates of the center are C(-1, 2). The radius, |CA|, is the distance from C to A which is 2 units (since 4-2=2).

We will use the principle of considering the worst-case scenario, often referred to as the \\"pigeonhole principle.\\" 1. **Step 1: Counting Total Balls** - There are 8 white balls. - There are 9 black balls. - There are 7 yellow balls. - The total number of balls is ( 8 + 9 + 7 = 24 ). 2. **Step 2: Considering the Worst-Case Scenario** - To ensure we have at least one ball of each color, consider the worst-case scenario where we avoid having all three colors up to the very end. - Start by picking balls that do not complete the set of three different colors. 3. **Step 3: Maximum Balls of Two Colors** - The worst-case scenario would be picking as many balls as possible of only two colors, to delay drawing the third color. - Let’s choose all the black balls and all the white balls first. - Number of black balls = 9. - Number of white balls = 8. - Total from these two colors: ( 9 + 8 = 17 ). 4. **Step 4: Drawing the First Ball of the Third Color** - After drawing all the black and white balls (17 balls), the next ball drawn must be yellow since we have exhausted all black and white balls. - Thus, it requires just one more ball to guarantee a yellow ball, making the total: ( 17 + 1 = 18 ). # Conclusion: Therefore, the minimum number of draws required to ensure at least one ball of each color is ( boxed{18} )."},{"prompt":"The analysis of the rising sea level along our country's coast mainly uses ( ).

This means that the total age of all the members at that time was 6 * 19 = 114 years. Since three years have passed, each of the original 6 members would have aged by 3 years. Therefore, the total increase in age for the 6 members would be 6 * 3 = 18 years. Adding this to the original total age, we get the new total age of the 6 members as 114 + 18 = 132 years.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 5, 7, and 8 is the smallest number that is divisible by all of these numbers. To find the LCM, we can prime factorize each number and then take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations. The prime factorizations are: - 3 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just 3. - 5 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just 5. - 7 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just 7. - 8 = 2^3. The LCM will be the product of the highest powers of all prime numbers that appear in these factorizations, which is 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7. Calculating this, we get: LCM = 8 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 24 * 35 = 840. So, the number we get when we add 37 to x must be a multiple of 840. Let's call this number y. Therefore, y = x + 37 and y is a multiple of 840. Since y is the smallest number that satisfies the condition and is a multiple of 840, we can say that y is equal to 840 itself or a multiple thereof. However, since we are looking for the initial value (x), we need to subtract 37 from y to find x.

In other words, (r_i) is bounded by (frac{1}{sqrt[n-1]{k} - 1}). - Take (r_i = 1, 2, ldots, leftlfloor frac{1}{sqrt[n-1]{k} - 1} rightrfloor) respectively, and ((1 + frac{1}{r_1}) cdots (1 + frac{1}{r_{i-1}})(1 + frac{1}{r_{i+1}}) cdots (1 + frac{1}{r_{n-1}}) = frac{k}{1 + frac{1}{r_i}}). - Repeating the process (n-2) times, as (k) is finite, we know that there are only a finite number of ((n-1))-tuples of positive integers (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{n-1}) such that ((1 + frac{1}{r_1})(1 + frac{1}{r_2}) cdots (1 + frac{1}{r_{n-1}})) is an integer. 3. **Back to the problem:** - We know that for (1 leq i leq n-1), we have (a_i - a_{i+1} mid a_{i+1}) and (a_n mid a_1). - Therefore, we can express (a_i = a_{i+1}(1 + frac{1}{r_i})). - Multiplying these (n-1) equations, we get (frac{a_1}{a_n} = (1 + frac{1}{r_1})(1 + frac{1}{r_2}) cdots (1 + frac{1}{r_{n-1}})). - By the lemma, there are only a finite number of (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{n-1}) that satisfy the equation. 4. **Fixed ((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{n-1})):** - Let (p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m) be all the prime factors of (r_1 r_2 cdots r_{n-1}). - Then (a_n) must be in the form of (p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} cdots p_m^{b_m}), because if (a_n) has a prime factor (q) which is not the same as (p_i), then (gcd(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) must be a multiple of (q), which is a contradiction. - Let (r_1 r_2 cdots r_{n-1} = p_1^{c_1} p_2^{c_2} cdots p_m^{c_m}), then we must have (b_i leq c_i) for all (1 leq i leq m). - If not, assume (b_j > c_j) for some (j), then (gcd(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) must be a multiple of (p_j), which is a contradiction. - As a result, there are at most ((c_1 + 1)(c_2 + 1) cdots (c_m + 1)) choices of (a_n). 5. **Counting the permutation:** - By counting the permutation of ((r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{n-1})), we know there are at most ((c_1 + 1)(c_2 + 1) cdots (c_m + 1)(n-1)!) choices of ((a_n, r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n)). - Notice that ((c_1 + 1)(c_2 + 1) cdots (c_m + 1)(n-1)!) is a finite and fixed number once we know what (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n) are. In conclusion, combining with the lemma, we know that there are only a finite number of (n)-tuples that satisfy all three conditions.

Each of these 16 people said: There is at least one liar in one of the rooms adjacent to mine. Two rooms are considered adjacent if they share a wall.

Each room contains one person, who is either a liar (always lies) or a knight (always tells the truth). Each person claims: \\"At least one of my neighboring rooms contains a liar.\\" Rooms are considered neighbors if they share a common wall. 2. **Key Insight**: Note that if two liars were neighbors, they would be telling the truth about each other, which contradicts the definition of liars. Hence, no two liars can be neighbors. 3. **Decompose the Grid into Pairs**: Divide the 4 times 4 grid into 8 pairs of neighboring rooms: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline A1 & B1 & A2 & B2 hline A3 & B3 & A4 & B4 hline A5 & B5 & A6 & B6 hline A7 & B7 & A8 & B8 hline end{array} ] Here, (A1, A2, ldots, A8) and (B1, B2, ldots, B8) form 8 pairs of neighboring rooms. Within each pair, only one room can contain a liar ( (A_i) or (B_i), but not both). 4. **Check for Maximum Liars**: Since a pair can have at most one liar, there can be up to 8 liars in total. 5. **Verification with a Chessboard Coloring**: We can use a chessboard coloring pattern to assign rooms to liars and knights: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline L & K & L & K hline K & L & K & L hline L & K & L & K hline K & L & K & L hline end{array} ] In this arrangement, (L) represents a liar and (K) represents a knight. Each liar ((L)) is in a \\"black\\" square, and each knight ((K)) is in a \\"white\\" square. Every liar has only knight neighbors who do not contradict their claim. 6. **Conclusion**: It is proven that the arrangement can support up to 8 liars without any contradictions.

Adding these percentages together gives us the total percentage of trucks and regular cars: [64% + 8% = 72%] This means that the remaining percentage of her collection must be convertibles. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, we subtract the percentage of trucks and regular cars from 100% to find the percentage of convertibles: [100% - 72% = 28%] Now, to find out how many convertibles she owns, we calculate 28% of her total collection of 125 matchbox cars.
