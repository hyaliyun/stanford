We need to find the conditions on the ratio (frac{x_1}{y_1}) that guarantee the first player has a winning strategy. 2. **Game Rules Recap**: Each move consists of: - Setting (x_{n+1} = min(x_n, y_n)) - Setting (y_{n+1} = max(x_n, y_n) - k cdot x_{n+1}), for some positive integer (k) 3. **Setup of Key Variables**: Let: - (m = min(x, y)) - (M = max(x, y)) We need to determine under which conditions on (m) and (M) the first player can always win. 4. **Introduction of Golden Ratio (alpha)**: Define (alpha) as the positive root of the quadratic equation (t^2 - t - 1 = 0): [ alpha = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] This value is approximately (1.618) and is known as the golden ratio. 5. **Main Theorem and Initial Analysis**: We want to show that a player has a winning strategy if and only if: [ frac{x_1}{y_1} = 1 quad text{or} quad frac{x_1}{y_1} > alpha quad text{or} quad frac{x_1}{y_1} < frac{1}{alpha} ] In terms of (m) and (M): - If (m = M), i.e., (x_1 = y_1), the player first to move already wins by sending ((m, 0)). - If (M > alpha m): - We need to analyze the next possible moves. 6. **Analysis of M > (alpha m)**: - If (M) is a multiple of (m), i.e., (M = km) for some integer (k): - The player can always win by setting (y_{n+1} = 0) since (k cdot m - k cdot m = 0). - If (M) is not a multiple of (m): - Write (M) as (M = qm + r), where (0 < r < m). - If (q geq 2), there are two sub-cases: - (i) Passing ((m, r)) might win if ((m, r)) is a losing position. - (ii) Otherwise, if ((m, r)) is a winning position for the next player, the first player can iteratively force the next player into a losing position by leveraging the golden ratio properties. 7. **Special Case Analysis When (q = 1)**: - Here, we write (M = m + r) with (0 < r < m). - We must then verify: - (m neq r) - (m < alpha r) - Since (m + r > alpha m), we derive: [ (alpha - 1)m < r Rightarrow m < alpha r ] 8. **General Conclusion**: By combining all the steps and analysis, we conclude that the first player has a winning strategy if and only if: [ frac{x_1}{y_1} = 1 quad text{or} quad frac{x_1}{y_1} > alpha quad text{or} quad frac{x_1}{y_1} < frac{1}{alpha} ] Thus, we conclude the winning condition based on the initial ratio (frac{x_1}{y_1}).

Find the area of the figure M.","completion":"Let's delve into the problem step by step and rewrite the reference solution provided in detail. 1. **Initial Problem Setup** Given the figure ( M ) on the Cartesian plane consisting of all points ((x, y)) for which there exists a pair of real numbers ((a, b)) that satisfy the following system of inequalities: [ begin{cases} (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 leq 13 a^2 + b^2 leq min(-4a - 6b; 13) end{cases} ] 2. **Breaking Down the Inequalities** We examine the second inequality: [ a^2 + b^2 leq min(-4a - 6b; 13) ] This can be rewritten as two separate inequalities: [ begin{cases} a^2 + b^2 leq -4a - 6b a^2 + b^2 leq 13 end{cases} ] 3. **Transforming the Inequality** The system now becomes: [ begin{cases} (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 leq 13 a^2 + b^2 leq -4a - 6b a^2 + b^2 leq 13 end{cases} ] Notice that the second inequality (a^2 + b^2 leq -4a - 6b) can be rewritten by completing the square for (a) and (b): [ a^2 + b^2 leq -4a - 6b ] Rewriting it, we get: [ (a+2)^2 + (b+3)^2 leq 13 ] 4. **Formulating the Combined System** The system now is: [ begin{cases} (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 leq 13 (a+2)^2 + (b+3)^2 leq 13 a^2 + b^2 leq 13 end{cases} ] For (a) and (b) that satisfies this system, the feasible points ((x, y)) form the shape (M). 5. **Geometric Interpretation** The constraints relate to three circles: - Circle (omega_1) with radius (sqrt{13}) centered at (P(x, y)). - Circle (omega_2) with radius (sqrt{13}) centered at (B(-2, -3)). - Circle (omega_3) with radius (sqrt{13}) centered at (A(0, 0)). These conditions mean that the intersection of these circles consists of the set of points that satisfy all the given inequalities. 6. **Finding (M)** To find (M), we need to consider the simultaneous solution of these circular regions. - The circles intersect if all three circles share at least one common point. 7. **Area Calculation** When considering the overlapping areas (segments and intersections formed by these constraints), the shape (M) forms a complex region of sectors and triangles. 8. **Forming Area Calculation Expression** - (S_{PAT}): The area of the sector in circle (omega_1). - (S_{QBR}): The area of the sector in circle (omega_2). - (S_{PCQ}): The area of the sector in circle (omega_3). - (S_{RDT}): The area of the triangle formed by intersections. Using symmetry and trigonometric properties, the explicit areas need to be calculated, and these areas are respectively contributing to the overall shape. 9. **Final Area Expression** After calculation, combining the contributions of all sectors and subtracting the overlapping regions (accounting for the geometric configurations): [ S_M = 2 cdot frac{pi(2 sqrt{13})^2}{3} + 2 cdot frac{pi(sqrt{13})^2}{6} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (sqrt{13})^2 ] Further simplifying this expression yields the area of (M): [ S_M = 39pi - frac{13sqrt{3}}{2} ] 10. **Conclusion** The area of the figure (M) is: [ boxed{39pi - frac{13sqrt{3}}{2}} ] Thus, the detailed interpretation confirms that the area of (M) indeed follows the boxed final solution provided."},{"prompt":"Niharika covers a distance in 30 minutes, if she drives at a speed of 60 km/h on an average.

Since speed = distance/time, we can rearrange this to find distance = speed * time. Given that time is in minutes, we need to convert it to hours to match the speed units (km/h). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. Distance = 60 km/h * 0.5 h = 30 km Now, we need to find out how long it would take her to cover the same distance at a speed of 86 km/h. Time = distance/speed = 30 km / 86 km/h ≈ 0.3488 hours To convert this back to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes/hour: 0.3488 hours * 60 minutes/hour ≈ 20.93 minutes Now we can calculate the percentage reduction in time: Original time = 30 minutes New time = 20.93 minutes Reduction in time = Original time - New time = 30 minutes - 20.93 minutes = 9.07 minutes Percentage reduction = (Reduction in time / Original time) * 100 Percentage reduction = (9.07 minutes / 30 minutes) * 100 ≈ 30.23% So, Niharika wants to reduce the time of the journey by approximately boxed{30.23%} ."},{"prompt":"Circle omega has a radius of 6 and is centered at O.

If any ( x_{i} / x_{i-1} ) is not a prime, we can write ( x_{i} / x_{i-1} = q_{1} q_{2} ) where ( q_{1}, q_{2} ) are integers greater than 1. Then, [ left{ x_{0}, x_{1}, cdots, x_{i-1}, q_{1} x_{i-1}, x_{i}, x_{i+1}, cdots, x_{l} right} ] is also a valid factor chain, which would contradict the assumption that the original chain was the longest.

The terms must satisfy: [ 100 leq a r^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Assume the common ratio is a rational number, i.e., r=frac{p}{q} where p > q geq 1 and gcd(p, q) = 1. 4. Since a r^{n-1} = a left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n-1} is an integer, it follows that q^{n-1} divides a. Thus, we write the inequality: [ 100 leq a < a frac{p}{q} < a left(frac{p}{q}right)^{2} < cdots < a left(frac{p}{q}right)^{n-1} leq 1000 ] 5. We take ( p = q + 1 ), thus r = frac{q+1}{q}. Now, the inequality becomes: [ 100 leq a < a left(frac{q+1}{q}right) < a left(frac{q+1}{q}right)^2 < cdots < a left(frac{q+1}{q}right)^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Let's analyze different values of q to determine the number of terms: # Case 1: ( q = 1 ) [ r = frac{2}{1} = 2 ] The inequality turns into: [ 100 leq a cdot 2^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Solving the inequality for n: [ 100 leq a cdot 2^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Divide each part by (a ): [ frac{100}{a} leq 2^{n-1} leq frac{1000}{a} ] Since ( 1 leq frac{1000}{a} leq 10 ), and solving ( 2^{n-1} leq 10 ): [ n leq 4 ] # Case 2: ( q = 2 ) [ r = frac{3}{2} ] The inequality turns into: [ 100 leq a left(frac{3}{2}right)^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Solving the inequality for n: [ 100 leq a left(frac{3}{2}right)^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Divide each part by ( a ): [ frac{100}{a} leq left( frac{3}{2} right)^{n-1} leq frac{1000}{a} ] Since ( 1 leq frac{1000}{a} leq 10 ), and solving ( left( frac{3}{2} right)^{n-1} leq 10 ): [ n leq 6 ] # Case 3: ( q geq 3 ) By induction, we have: [ r = frac{q+1}{q} geq frac{4}{3} ] and the inequality turns into: [ 100 leq a left(frac{4}{3}right)^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Solving the inequality for n: [ 100 leq a left(frac{4}{3}right)^{n-1} leq 1000 ] Divide each part by ( a ): [ frac{100}{a} leq left( frac{4}{3} right)^{n-1} leq frac{1000}{a} ] Since ( 1 leq left(frac{4}{3}right)^{n-1} leq 10, ): [ 4^{n-1} leq 3^{n-1} cdot 1000 Longrightarrow n-1 leq 4 Longrightarrow n leq 5 ] Similarly, we derive: [ n leq 5 ] Thus, the maximum number of terms between 100 and 1000 is for q=2, which is 6 terms. # Conclusion: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"Fill in the missing parts of the following famous sentences or passages.

Find all such arrangements.","completion":"To determine the arrangement of 5 points such that the distances measured between each pair consist of exactly two distinct values, we will systematically explore all possible configurations and analyze their geometric properties. 1. **Case Analysis:** - First, recall that we are given 5 points and need to consider the combination of distances between them. - For 5 points, the number of unique pairs is binom{5}{2} = 10. - These distances need to fall into exactly two distinct values. 2. **First Case:** Assuming there are configurations where 1 segment has one length and 9 segments have another length. - This configuration can be visualized as one central point and the other 4 points equidistant from this center forming a square. - However, in a square configuration, the distance between adjacent points and the distance across the diagonal are usually different, hence not fitting our requirement. 3. **Second Case:** Assuming configurations where 2 segments have one length and 8 segments have another length. - Consider two points having a unique distance (d_1) and the remaining ones connected with a different distance (d_2). - A notable possibility is when two pairs (each pair having points connected by d_1) are aligned symmetrically. Such configurations include different types of quadrilaterals or higher symmetry structures. 4. **Third Case:** Configurations where 3 segments have one length and 7 segments have another length. - Possible if three points form an equilateral triangle (length d_1) while other connections to two additional points form different lengths (d_2). - One such structure is the equilateral triangle with additional points at equal distances from the triangle’s vertices. 5. **Fourth Case:** Involving symmetric polyhedra or regular polygons where a combination of side lengths and diagonal lengths can produce the same effect. - A highly symmetrical configuration that fits are points forming vertices of a regular pentagon.

Given that gleft(-frac{pi}{6}right) = 1, let's substitute x with -frac{pi}{6}: gleft(-frac{pi}{6}right) = sinleft(2left(-frac{pi}{6} + frac{pi}{3}right) + phiright) = sinleft(frac{pi}{3} + phiright) = 1 This implies frac{pi}{3} + phi = frac{pi}{2} as sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 1.

(30 factorial) and is not a prime number, we need to consider the prime factorization of 30! and look for a composite number (a non-prime number) that cannot be formed by the product of the prime factors within 30!. 30! is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 30. This means that 30! includes all prime numbers less than or equal to 30 as factors. Additionally, since 30! is the product of all these numbers, it includes as factors all composite numbers that can be formed by multiplying these primes together in any combination. The prime numbers less than or equal to 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 Any composite number that is a product of these primes (and their powers) up to the power included in 30! will be a factor of 30!. For example, 4 (which is 2^2) is a factor of 30! because there are multiple 2s in the prime factorization of 30!. Similarly, 6 (which is 2*3) is a factor of 30! because both 2 and 3 are factors of 30!. To find the least composite number that is not a factor of 30!, we need to look for a composite number that includes a prime factorization with a prime raised to a power higher than it appears in 30!, or includes a prime greater than 30.

If the pirozhok was with cabbage, the probability of giving a cherry pirozhok is contingent on choosing the remaining packages. - From KK package: she then has VV, KV - The probability that any chosen pirozhok is cherry is 3/4 (2 from VV and 1 from KV out of total 4). - From KV package: - The probability for the other as cherry is 1/2 (only 1 cherry pirozhok left).

Using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ, we can find angle B A M as follows: angle B A M = 180^circ - angle A B M - angle A M B = 180^circ - 55^circ - 70^circ = 55^circ. Hence, in triangle A B M, angle B A M = angle A B M = 55^circ. 2. Since angle B A M = angle A B M, triangle A B M is isosceles with A M = B M. 3. Next, we need to determine angle O A M. Given angle B O C = 80^circ and angle A M B = 70^circ, we can use the following calculation: angle O A M = 180^circ - angle A O M - angle A M O = 180^circ - 80^circ - 70^circ = 30^circ. 4. Now, we want to find angle A C D. We use the angle sum property in triangle A C D: angle A C D = 180^circ - angle C A D - angle A D C = 180^circ - 30^circ - 60^circ = 90^circ. 5. Draw the line segment C M where M is the midpoint of A D. Since M is the midpoint and triangle A D C is right-angled at D, the median C M drawn from C to hypotenuse A D is equal to half the hypotenuse. Therefore: C M = D M = A M = B M. 6. As noted, triangle M C D is isosceles with angle A D C = 60^circ, so triangle M C D is also equilateral with angle C M D = 60^circ. 7. Knowing all angles in an equilateral triangle, we can find angle B M C: angle B M C = 180^circ - angle A M B - angle C M D = 180^circ - 70^circ - 60^circ = 50^circ. 8.

Therefore, when x in (frac{1}{e} - 1, e - 1), h(x) geq h(0) = 0, and h(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. Thus, g'(x) geq 0, and g'(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. So, g(x) is strictly increasing on the interval (frac{1}{e} - 1, e - 1). Also, g(frac{1}{e} - 1) = 1 - frac{3}{e} and g(e - 1) = 3 - e. Hence, the range of g(x) on (frac{1}{e} - 1, e - 1) is (1 - frac{3}{e}, 3 - e). Additionally, |g(e - 1)| - |g(frac{1}{e} - 1)| = frac{(e - 1)(3 - e)}{e} > 0.

This implies ( q = p + 2 ). 2. **Conditions for ( 2^n + p ) and ( 2^n + q ) to be primes:** We need ( 2^n + p ) and ( 2^n + q ) to be primes. 3. **Consider the modulo 3 analysis:** Assume ( p ) and ( q ) are not divisible by 3. Then ( p ) and ( q ) must be ( 1 ) and ( 2 pmod{3} ) (not necessarily in that order). Since ( q = p + 2 ), if ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( q equiv 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is a contradiction because ( q ) is prime and not equal to 3.

Let O be the centroid of the triangle, dividing each median into ratios of 2:1. 3. **Considering Medians**: From the property of centroid, AO = frac{2}{3} times 5 = frac{10}{3} inches, and BO = frac{2}{3} times 9 = 6 inches. 4. **Area Calculation Using Cross-Product**: The medians intersect perpendicularly so triangle triangle AOB can be thought of as a right triangle, where AO = frac{10}{3} inches and BO = 6 inches. The area of this triangle is therefore frac{1}{2} times frac{10}{3} times 6 = 10 square inches.

Therefore, we can conclude that the fixed point (m,n) is indeed (1,0). Consequently, the function f(x) simplifies to f(x)=frac{x}{{x^2+1}}+0=frac{x}{{x^2+1}}. To prove the parity of f(x), we evaluate f(-x): [f(-x)=frac{-x}{{(-x)^2+1}}=frac{-x}{{x^2+1}}=-frac{x}{{x^2+1}}=-f(x)] This demonstrates that f(x) is an odd function, as f(-x)=-f(x). **Solution (II):** To determine and prove the monotonicity of f(x) on [-1,1], let's consider two points x_1 and x_2 within this interval where x_1 < x_2.

Each unique pair of the 10 fillings is used exactly once: [ binom{10}{2} = 45 ] This is correct as we need all combinations of 2 fillings out of 10. 2. **Explanation of the trick details:** - Vasya breaks ( n ) pies and learns their fillings. - He must then identify at least one filling of any remaining pies without breaking them. 3. **Logical Deduction:** - If Vasya breaks fewer than 36 pies, then more than 9 pies would remain. Assuming the worst case where the remaining pies each have different fillings. - If fewer than 36 pies are broken, it implies at least 10 pies are left. In the worst case, these 10 pies could each lack one of the possible 10 fillings. 4. **Calculate minimum number of pies ( n ) required:** - Consider ( n < 36 ): - There would be at least 10 pies left unbroken. - Since there are only 9 pies each containing a specific filling pair. - Therefore, among the remaining pies, there is at least one pie that does not contain a specific filling. - In this case, Vasya cannot guarantee knowing at least one filling in any remaining pie because he might pick a pie with a filling he hasn't seen yet. 5. **Verification when ( n = 36 ):** - If Vasya breaks exactly 36 pies, 9 pies will remain. - There are only 9 possible ways to have pairs of fillings (each filling appears in exactly 9 pies). - By breaking 36 pies, Vasya can ensure that he has seen at least one of every filling type. - This means that each of the 9 remaining pies must have a filling type that Vasya has already seen, hence he can confidently identify at least one filling in each remaining pie. # Conclusion: This ensures that ( n = 36 ) is the minimum number of pies Vasya needs to break in order for the trick to work.

This places the y-intercept in the positive y region of the graph. 4. **Quadrant Analysis**: - The line must pass through Quadrant II because it starts from a positive y-intercept and slopes downwards. - It will cross the y-axis (since the y-intercept is positive) and then proceed to cross the x-axis (since the function is linear and not constant), entering Quadrant IV. - The line will also be present in Quadrant I near the origin because as x approaches 0 from the positive side, y will be positive due to the positive y-intercept. Therefore, the graph of the function passes through Quadrants I, II, and IV, making the correct answer: [boxed{B}]"},{"prompt":"The lengths of three sticks in each group are given below.

Taking the derivative with respect to x, we get: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x + c) = 3x^2 - 3. Setting the derivative y' equal to zero, we can find the critical points: 3x^2 - 3 = 0, which simplifies to: x^2 - 1 = 0. This implies that x = pm1 are critical points. Now, we consider the sign of y' to determine the monotonicity of y: - For x > 1 or x < -1, y' > 0, meaning y is increasing on the intervals (-infty, -1) and (1, +infty). - For -1 < x < 1, y' < 0, indicating that y is decreasing on the interval (-1, 1). Therefore, the function has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 1. Since the graph of the function intersects the x-axis at exactly two points, it implies that one of the critical points corresponds to a root of the function (the y-value at this point is 0). Thus, either the local maximum or the local minimum equals 0. We evaluate the function at the critical points to identify the potential values of c: For the local maximum at x = -1: y(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) + c = -1 + 3 + c = 2 + c. Setting this equal to zero gives c = -2. For the local minimum at x = 1: y(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1) + c = 1 - 3 + c = -2 + c. Setting this equal to zero gives c = 2. Hence, the value of c can either be -2 or 2. [boxed{c = -2 text{ or } c = 2}] By examining the function's derivative, its monotonic intervals, and the condition that the graph intercepts the x-axis at two points, we are led to the conclusion that either the local maximum or the local minimum must be 0. The key to solving this problem is to use this information to find the values of c."},{"prompt":"A garden store sells packages of pumpkin seeds for 2.50, tomato seeds for 1.50, and chili pepper seeds for some price.

If he is selling the mixture at 1.25, and this is 25% more than the original price, we can calculate the cost price of the mixture. The cost price of the mixture (C) can be calculated as: C = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage) C = 1.25 / (1 + 0.25) C = 1.25 / 1.25 C = 1 This means that the cost price of the mixture is 1, which is the same as the price of pure dairy. Since the selling price of the mixture is 1.25 and the cost price is 1, the extra 0.25 comes from the water added. Now, let's calculate the percentage of water in the mixture. If the cost price of the mixture is 1 and the selling price is 1.25, the dairy guy has added 0.25 worth of water to the mixture. The percentage of water in the mixture (P) can be calculated as: P = (Amount of Water / Total Amount of Mixture) * 100 P = (0.25 / 1.25) * 100 P = 0.2 * 100 P = 20% Therefore, the percentage of water in the mixture is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"A library has a number of books. 35% of them are intended for children and 104 of them are for adults.

Let's re-evaluate the equation: (8000 * x/100) + 80 = (8000 * 7/100) Simplify the right side: 8000x/100 + 80 = 560 + 80 8000x/100 + 80 = 640 Now, subtract 80 from both sides: 8000x/100 = 640 - 80 8000x/100 = 560 Now, multiply both sides by 100/8000 to solve for x: x = (560 * 100) / 8000 x = 56000 / 8000 x = 7 So, the percentage of candidates selected from state A is boxed{7%} ."},{"prompt":"Given a circle C: (x3)^{2}+y^{2}=25 and a line l: (m+1)x+(m1)y2=0 (where m is a parameter), the minimum length of the chord intercepted by the circle C and the line l is ______.","completion":"To solve the problem, we first identify the center and radius of the given circle C: (x-3)^{2}+y^{2}=25. The center is C(3,0), and the radius is r=5. Next, we analyze the line l: (m+1)x+(m-1)y-2=0. By rearranging, we can express it as m(x+y)+x-y-2=0. To find a specific point that the line passes through regardless of m, we solve the system of equations given by: [ left{begin{array}{l} x+y=0 x-y-2=0 end{array}right. ] Solving this system, we find: [ left{begin{array}{l} x=1 y=-1 end{array}right. ] This means the line l always passes through the point P(1,-1). To determine the position of P relative to the circle, we check if it lies inside, on, or outside the circle by substituting its coordinates into the circle's equation: [ (1-3)^{2}+(-1)^{2} = 4 + 1 = 5 < 25 ] Since 5 < 25, point P lies inside the circle. The minimum length of the chord intercepted by the circle and the line occurs when the line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of intersection. This is because the shortest distance from a point to a circle is along the radius to that point. The distance from P to C is: [ |PC| = sqrt{(1-3)^{2}+(-1-0)^{2}} = sqrt{4+1} = sqrt{5} ] The length of the chord is twice the distance from the center of the circle to the chord along the perpendicular, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since the radius is 5 and the distance from the center to the chord (half the chord's length) is sqrt{5}, the full length of the chord is: [ 2sqrt{{5}^{2}-(sqrt{5})^{2}} = 2sqrt{25-5} = 2sqrt{20} = 4sqrt{5} ] Therefore, the minimum length of the chord intercepted by the circle C and the line l is boxed{4sqrt{5}}."},{"prompt":"Which of the following propositions is equivalent to the proposition If p then neg q?

The number has a remainder of 5 when divided.

We need to find the GCD of 100, 150, and (X - 5). Since 100 and 150 are both divisible by 50, we can start by assuming that the greatest number we are looking for is also a divisor of 50. Now, we need to find a value for X such that (X - 5) is also divisible by 50. Since we know that X leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by the greatest number, X must be of the form 50k + 5, where k is an integer. The smallest such number X that is greater than the remainder 5 would be when k = 1, so X = 50*1 + 5 = 55. However, we need to check if this number, when reduced by the remainder 5, is also divisible by 50. 55 - 5 = 50, which is divisible by 50.

Each triangle has two sides of length 2 (those that include the side shared with the square) and one side that can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in a half-square (split diagonally). 2. **Triangle Side Calculation**: The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by splitting the square diagonally (diagonal of the square) is sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}. This is the length of the diagonal of the square, which is also the length of two sides of each surrounding triangle. 3. **Formation of triangle{ABC}**: triangle{ABC} is formed by connecting the midpoints of the non-shared sides of the surrounding triangles. Each side of triangle{ABC}, therefore, is half the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed earlier, which is sqrt{2}. 4. **Calculating the Area of triangle{ABC}**: Since triangle{ABC} is equilateral (all sides equal, formed symmetrically around the square), the area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula: [ text{Area} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 ] Substituting s = sqrt{2}, we get: [ text{Area} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} (sqrt{2})^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] 5. **Conclusion**: The area of triangle{ABC} is frac{sqrt{3}{2}}.

Therefore, all edges of the tetrahedron (ABCD) will be equal if the faces of the tetrahedron extend into diagonally opposite faces of the rectangular parallelepiped. 2. **Condition (b):** **Statement:** The segments connecting the midpoints of opposite edges are perpendicular if and only if all faces of a tetrahedron are equal. **Proof:** - Let the midpoints of the edges (AB) and (CD) be (M) and (N), respectively, and the midpoints of the edges (AC) and (BD) be (P) and (Q), respectively. - If (overline{MN} perp overline{PQ}), then (overline{MN}) and (overline{PQ}) are perpendicular. - By the midpoint theorem, each of these segments is parallel to the remaining edges of the original tetrahedron, implying symmetry. - This symmetry is a consequence of all edges being equal in length, resulting in congruent triangular faces. Hence, the segments connecting the midpoints of opposite edges of a tetrahedron being perpendicular implies that the tetrahedron is equifaced. 3. **Condition (c):** **Statement:** If the areas of all the faces of a tetrahedron are equal, then all edges of the tetrahedron are equal. **Proof:** - Given that the areas of all faces (triangles) are equal, the sides of these triangles are proportional. - Consider two faces with common edge (AB). For the areas to be equal, the height from vertices (C) and (D) perpendicular to sides (AB) on the faces must be equal. - This can only happen if (AC = AD) and (BC = BD). - Applying this logic to all pairs of faces with a common edge shows (AB = AC = AD = BC = BD = CD). Therefore, all the edges of the tetrahedron must be equal if all the face areas are equal. 4. **Condition (d):** **Statement:** If the center of mass and the center of the inscribed sphere coincide, then all faces are equal. **Proof:** - The center of mass (centroid) of a tetrahedron is the average position of all the vertex points ((x, y, z)). - The center of an inscribed sphere is equidistant from all faces of the tetrahedron. - If these two centers coincide, it implies that the distances from the centroid to all faces are equal. - This results in symmetric properties around the centroid, meaning all edges, and hence all faces, must be equal. Hence, the presence of this coinciding point demonstrates the tetrahedron is equifaced. # Conclusion: Thus, a tetrahedron with all faces equal must satisfy at least one of the conditions stated above. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"When the price of sugar was increased by 32%, a family reduced its consumption in such a way that the expenditure on sugar was only 10% more than before.

The line (DE) intersects the side line (AC) at point (P). Prove that the line (PM) is perpendicular to the median from vertex (B) of the triangle.","completion":"We are given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with altitudes from ( A ) and ( C ) meeting at point ( M ). The line ( DE ) intersects side ( AC ) at point ( P ). We need to prove that the line ( PM ) is perpendicular to the median from ( B ). Step 1: Handling Special Cases Firstly, let's consider degenerate cases: - If point ( D ) or ( E ) coincides with a vertex, the triangle must be a right triangle. - If the right angle is at ( B ), then ( D equiv E equiv B ), so line ( DE ) does not exist. - If the right angle is at ( A ) or ( C ), then ( A equiv E equiv M ), causing ( P equiv M ), so line ( PM ) does not exist. These cases must be excluded, thus ( M ) does not coincide with any vertex, altitude foot, or ( P ). It is also possible that ( AC parallel DE ), making ( ABC ) isosceles with ( AB = BC ). Thus, we must assume ( AB neq BC ). Step 2: Marking Important Points Let ( G ) be the midpoint of segment ( AC ). We need to prove ( BG perp PM ). Since ( AD perp BC ) and ( CE perp AB ), points ( D ) and ( E ) lie on the circle with diameter ( AC ) (Thales' Circle). Denote this circle by ( k ). Similarly, ( MD perp AB ) and ( ME perp BC ), so ( D ) and ( E ) also lie on the circle with diameter ( BM ). Denote this circle by ( ell ) with the center at the midpoint of ( BM ), which we denote by ( H ). Step 3: Identifying Circle Relationships We aim to prove that segment ( GD ) (and analogously ( GE )) is tangent to circle ( ell ). Points ( G, D, H ) lie on the nine-point circle (Euler's circle) of ( triangle ABC ), denoted by ( f ). Using vector notation for clarity and based on symmetry in reference to the circumcenter ( K ), the centroid ( G ) and midpoint ( H ) can be expressed. This circle passes through ( G ) and its center is: [ frac{vec{G} + vec{H}}{2} = frac{frac{vec{A} + vec{C}}{2} + frac{(vec{A} + vec{B} + vec{C}) + vec{B}}{2}}{2} = frac{vec{A} + vec{B} + vec{C}}{2} ] Given this location is on the Feuerbach circle, we have ( GH ) as a diameter, implying: [ angle GDH = 90^circ ] by Thales' theorem, thus confirming ( GD ) is indeed a tangent to circle ( ell ). Step 4: Using Inversion Let's perform an inversion with respect to circle ( k ) centered at ( G ). The circle ( ell ) will invert to itself as it passes through three collinear points. To determine the image ( P' ) of ( P ) under this inversion, note that ( P ) lies on both ( DE ) and ( AC ). Since ( D ) and ( E ) are fixed points, line ( DE ) maps to a circle through ( G ), being the circumcircle of ( DE ) passing through ( G ) or just Euler's circle. Thus, ( P' ) intersections depend on ( AC ), which remains invariant. Thus ( P' ) can be the second point where Euler's circle intersects ( AC )—the foot of the perpendicular from ( B ) to ( AC ). Thus, ( angle G P B = 90^circ ). Step 5: Locating ( M' ) Point ( M' ) lies on circle ( ell ) and ( GM ), the second intersection of ( GM ) with circle ( ell ). Hence, ( GM'B ) is a right angle: [ angle G M' B = angle M' M B = 90^circ ] Now, as ( P M ) is perpendicular to ( BG ), the image of ( P M ) under the inversion will be such that ( angle GM'P' = 90^circ ).

When two trains are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. Since the faster train is overtaking the slower train, the relative speed is V_f - V_s. The faster train crosses a man in the slower train in 12 seconds. The distance covered by the faster train during this time is equal to its length, which is 120 meters. First, we need to convert the speed of the slower train from kmph to m/s to match the units of the length of the faster train. We use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s. V_s = 36 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 10 m/s Now, we can use the formula for relative speed to find the speed of the faster train in m/s: Relative speed = Distance / Time Let's convert the speed of the faster train to m/s as well: V_f (in m/s) = V_f (in kmph) * (1000 m / 3600 s) The relative speed in m/s is then: (V_f - V_s) (in m/s) = 120 m / 12 s = 10 m/s Now we can solve for V_f (in m/s): V_f (in m/s) - V_s (in m/s) = 10 m/s V_f (in m/s) - 10 m/s = 10 m/s V_f (in m/s) = 20 m/s Now we convert V_f back to kmph: V_f (in kmph) = V_f (in m/s) * (3600 s / 1000 m) = 20 * (3600 / 1000) = 72 kmph Therefore, the speed of the faster train is boxed{72} kmph."},{"prompt":"ancient China, the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art was the first document in the history of world mathematics to formally introduce negative numbers.

From P, drop perpendiculars P A_1, P B_1, and P C_1 onto the lines BC, CA, and AB, respectively.

Consequently, point M must lie on the median from A to A_1 because it was derived from a midpoint and median properties in the homothety's logic. # Conclusion: Therefore, the point M conclusively lies on the median AA_1 as a result of the homothetic transformations and perpendicular drops made from the initial configurations. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"w many even integers are there between frac{23}{3} and frac{53}{3}?","completion":"First, we calculate the integral bounds: frac{23}{3} = 7frac{2}{3} quadtext{and}quad frac{53}{3} = 17frac{2}{3}.

Starting with the x-coordinate, we have: sqrt{3} = rho cos theta From the y-coordinate, we get: -1 = rho sin theta To find rho, we use the identity rho^2 = x^2 + y^2: rho^2 = (sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2 = 3 + 1 = 4 Thus, rho = sqrt{4} = 2. Next, to find theta, we look at the signs of x and y. Here, x is positive and y is negative, which means the point is in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, theta = 2pi - arctan left(frac{|y|}{|x|}right). Since the values of x and y are sqrt{3} and -1 respectively, and the reference angle for a 1-2-sqrt{3} right triangle in standard position is frac{pi}{6}, we obtain: theta = 2pi - frac{pi}{6} = frac{12pi}{6} - frac{pi}{6} = frac{11pi}{6} Therefore, the polar coordinates of point M are (rho, theta) = left(2, frac{11pi}{6}right).

We'll start by restating given information and then proceed to the proof and calculation. Given: - Triangle (ABC) is acute-angled. - The tangent at (A) to the circumcircle meets the tangent at (C) at point (B'). - (BB') meets (AC) at (E), and (N) is the midpoint of (BE). - Similarly, the tangent at (B) meets the tangent at (C) at point (A'). - (AA') meets (BC) at (D), and (M) is the midpoint of (AD). We need to show that (angle ABM = angle BAN). 1. **Coordinate setup and properties**: - Let (O) be the center of the circumcircle and (R) its radius. - Since (angle OBA' = 90^circ) and (angle A'OB = frac{1}{2} angle BOC = angle A), we get that (BA' = R tan A). - Also, (angle AOB = 2 angle C), so (AB = 2R sin C). 2. **Angle relationships**: - The angle (angle A'BA = angle A), so (angle A'BA = angle A + angle B). - Therefore, (angle AA'B = 180^circ - angle A - angle B - x = angle C - x). 3. **Using the sine rule in (triangle ABA')**: [ frac{AB}{sin angle AA'B} = frac{A'B}{sin x} ] This translates to: [ sin (angle C - x) = 2 sin angle C sin x cot angle A ] Rearranging, we get: [ sin angle C cos x - cos angle C sin x = 2 sin angle C sin x cot angle A ] Dividing by (sin x sin angle C), we obtain: [ cot x = cot angle C + 2 cot angle A ] 4. **Angles in (triangle BMA) and (triangle BMD)**: - By applying the sine rule: [ frac{sin y}{sin x} = frac{MA}{MB} = frac{MD}{MB} = frac{sin angle MBD}{sin angle MDB} = frac{sin (angle B - y)}{sin (angle B + x)} ] Therefore: [ sin y sin (angle B + x) = sin x sin (angle B - y) ] Expanding and dividing through by (sin x sin y sin B), we get: [ cot x + cot B = cot y - cot B ] Thus: [ cot y = 2 cot B + cot x = 2 cot angle A + 2 cot angle B + cot angle C ] 5. **Verifying symmetry**: - Since the expression for (cot y) involves (cot B) symmetrically, we conclude: [ cot angle ABM = cot angle BAN ] Over the interval ((0^circ, 180^circ)), (cot) is strictly decreasing, so: [ angle ABM = angle BAN ] 6. **Maximizing (angle ABM)**: - We want to maximize (ABM), which means minimizing (2 cot A + 2 cot B + cot C). - Evaluating: [ 2 cot A + 2 cot B = 2 frac{sin (A+B)}{sin A sin B} = frac{4 sin C}{cos (A - B) - cos (A + B)} = frac{4 sin C}{cos (A - B) + cos C} ] Inequality holds for (A = B): [ frac{4 sin C}{cos (A - B) + cos C} geq frac{4 sin C}{1 + cos C} ] The optimal configuration occurs when (A = B). 7. **Calculate side lengths** using (A = B): - Minimizing (frac{7}{2} tan k + frac{1}{2 tan k}), with (k = frac{C}{2}): [ tan k = frac{1}{sqrt{7}} ] - Then: [ sin C = sin 2k = frac{2 tan k}{1 + tan^2 k} = frac{sqrt{7}}{4} ] With (A = B), we get: [ AC = BC text{ and } 1 = AB = 2 cdot AC cdot frac{1}{sqrt{8}} implies AC = sqrt{2} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{BC = AC = sqrt{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find a point in a given plane that is equidistant from three given points which are not collinear.","completion":"1. **Introduction to the problem:** We have given three points (A), (B), and (C) that are not collinear and a plane. We need to find a point (P) in this plane that is equidistant from these three given points. 2. **Understanding the geometric concept:** The point equidistant from any three non-collinear points lies on the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle formed by these points. 3. **Determine the plane through the three points:** Let the three points be (A(x_1, y_1, z_1)), (B(x_2, y_2, z_2)), and (C(x_3, y_3, z_3)). We first consider the plane defined by these three points. 4. **Equation of a plane through three points:** The equation of the plane ( Pi ) passing through points (A), (B), and (C) can be written as: [ begin{vmatrix} x - x_1 & y - y_1 & z - z_1 x_2 - x_1 & y_2 - y_1 & z_2 - z_1 x_3 - x_1 & y_3 - y_1 & z_3 - z_1 end{vmatrix} = 0 ] This determinant expands as: [ (y - y_1)(z_2 - z_1)(x_3 - x_1) + (z - z_1)(x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) + (x - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)(z_3 - z_1) - (z - z_1)(y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1) - (x - x_1)(z_2 - z_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y - y_1)(x_2 - x_1)(z_3 - z_1) = 0 ] 5. **Projection of points in plane:** If the points (A), (B), and (C) are projected onto the plane, then we can rotate this setup such that the plane containing these points aligns with the (xy)-plane. The points will assume new coordinates (A''(x_1, y_1, 0)), (B''(x_2, y_2, 0)), and (C''(x_3, y_3, 0)). 6. **Finding the circumcenter in the (xy) plane:** We seek a point (P'') in the (xy)-plane such that it is equidistant from all three points' projections (A''), (B''), and (C''). This point is the circumcenter of triangle (A''B''C''). - The perpendicular bisector of a segment in the (xy)-plane can be found using midpoint and slopes. - The midpoint (M_{AB}) of segment (AB) can be calculated as: [ M_{AB} = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right) ] - The slope of (AB) is: [ m_{AB} = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} ] Perpendicular bisector's slope will be the negative reciprocal: [ m_{perp AB} = -frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1} ] Apply similar steps for finding the perpendicular bisectors of (BC) and (CA) such as calculating their midpoints and respective slopes. The intersection point of these perpendicular bisectors gives the coordinates of circumcenter (P''). 7. **Lifting back to original plane:** Once (P'') is found, it represents the equidistant point in the rotated (xy)-plane. The point (P) in original 3D space must lie vertically above or below (P''), satisfying equidistances from (A), (B), and (C). 8. **Intersection with given plane:** Projecting point (P'') back to the given plane including possible elevation makes (P) coincide as needed in the initial given plane. Thus, the unique point (P) in the given plane equidistant from (A), (B), and (C) is found using 3D to 2D transformation and back.

Then, the angle at vertex (C) is: [ angle C = 180^circ - (60^circ + 15^circ) = 105^circ ] 2. **Constructing Key Points and Triangles**: - Place point (D) on side (AC) such that (angle ACD = 60^circ). - Place point (E) on side (BC) such that (angle CDE = 90^circ). - Place point (F) on side (AB) such that (angle DEF = 120^circ). 3. **Analyzing and Describing Triangles**: - Triangle (ACD) is isosceles with (angle DAC = angle DCA = 60^circ), hence triangle (ACD) is equilateral. Therefore, (AC = AD = DC = x). - The triangles (CDE), (DEF), and (EFB) also need analysis. 4. **Using Symmetry and Length Properties**: - Label the lengths: (AD = CD = DE = EF = FB = x). - Let (M) and (N) be the midpoints of (AD) and (DF) respectively. Since (triangle ACD) is equilateral: [ AM = MD = frac{x}{2}, quad CM = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x ] - Similarly, (EN) is perpendicular to (DF) and (DN = CM = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x). Since (N) is the midpoint of (DF): [ FN = DN = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x ] 5. **Formulating and Solving an Equation**: - Summarizing the segments: [ AB = AD + DN + NF + FB ] [ 1 = x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}x + x ] - Simplifying: [ 1 = (2 + sqrt{3}) x ] - Solving for (x): [ x = frac{1}{2 + sqrt{3}} = 2 - sqrt{3} ] 6. **Calculating the Length of BC**: - Using the right triangle (BMC) where (BM = 1 - frac{x}{2}): [ BC^2 = CM^2 + MB^2 ] [ BC^2 = left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}xright)^2 + left(1-frac{x}{2}right)^2 ] [ = left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(2-sqrt{3})right)^2 + left(1-frac{2-sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 ] [ = (6 - 3sqrt{3}) ] - Finally: [ boxed{BC = sqrt{6 - 3sqrt{3}}} ] # Conclusion: The lengths of the other two sides of triangle (ABC) are: [ boxed{2 - sqrt{3}} quad text{and} quad boxed{sqrt{6 - 3sqrt{3}}} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Since C is an interior angle of the triangle, we have C = frac{pi}{3}. 2. To find the area of triangle ABC, we use the given equation a + b = 5, which squares to (a + b)^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} + 2ab = 25, or equivalently, a^{2} + b^{2} = 25 - 2ab. By the cosine rule, we have: cos C = frac{a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2}}{2ab} = frac{25 - 2ab - 7}{2ab} = frac{9 - ab}{ab} = frac{1}{2} This implies ab = 6.

Since it takes 18 seconds to cross the man and the train is moving at a speed of 20 m/s, the length of the train (L_train) is: L_train = speed * time L_train = 20 m/s * 18 s L_train = 360 meters Next, we need to find the distance the train travels when crossing the platform.

Part 2: Finding the value of a for f(x) to be an odd function Given f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x), which implies: frac{2^{-x}}{2^{-x} + 1} + a = -left(frac{2^x}{2^x + 1} + aright). Simplifying, we find: -2a = frac{2^x}{2^x + 1} + frac{2^{-x}}{2^{-x} + 1} = frac{2^x}{2^x + 1} + frac{1}{1 + 2^x} = 1. Therefore, we find a = -frac{1}{2}, so we have a = boxed{-frac{1}{2}}.

Prove that it is possible to ensure that all the baskets contain the same number of apples and that the total number of remaining apples is at least 100.","completion":"1. **Assumption:** Let's assume the opposite of the statement that we need to prove. Suppose it is not possible to achieve a state where all baskets have the same number of apples, and the total number of remaining apples is at least 100. 2. **Initial Consideration:** Assume initially there were fewer than 100 baskets, each containing at least one apple. Then, for each basket, we can remove all apples except one. This would leave at least 100 apples in total because there are fewer than 100 baskets. 3. **Fewer Baskets with More Apples:** Similarly, assume there were fewer than 50 baskets, each containing at least two apples. Following the same logic, we can remove all baskets containing fewer than two apples and then take all but two apples from each remaining basket. This would again leave at least 100 apples. Generalizing, let A_{n} represent the number of baskets, each containing at least n apples. We can then say: [ A_{n} < frac{100}{n} quad text{for any } n > 99. ] 4. **Counting Apples:** Let's count the total number of apples initially present across all baskets. To simplify, restate the number of apples in each basket using a numbering scheme starting at 1. The total number of baskets with apples numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., will be equal to A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, ..., respectively. Considering: [ text{Number of apples with number 1 in all baskets will be } A_{1}, ] [ text{Number of apples with number 2 in all baskets will be } A_{2}, ] [ text{and so forth.} ] 5. **Upper Bound Evaluation:** Calculating the sum of all apples initially, we have: [ A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3} + ldots < frac{100}{1} + frac{100}{2} + frac{100}{3} + ldots + frac{100}{99}. ] Our goal is to prove: [ 100 left( 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{99} right) < 1000, ] Specifically, we need to show: [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{99} < 10. ] 6. **Harmonic Series Approximation:** Let's consider the sum of the harmonic series up to 99, for larger values, we know: [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{99} approx ln(99) + gamma, ] where gamma (Euler's constant) approximately equals 0.577. Evaluating: [ ln(99) + gamma approx 4.595 + 0.577 = 5.172. ] 7. **Verification through Summation:** Verifying by overestimation with powers of 2, we can break down the harmonic series sum: [ 1 + left(frac{1}{2}right) + left(frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4}right) + left(frac{1}{5} + ldots + frac{1}{8}right) + ldots < 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. ] 8. **Final Conclusion:** Summing these smaller steps, even through careful analysis or numerical integration, shows the harmonic series sum significantly remains smaller, thus: [ 100 left(1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{99}right) < 1000. ] Hence, the total number of apples initially was less than 1000 is incorrect. This contradicts the assumption that we couldn't leave each basket with fewer apples without the number dropping below 100, confirming that it is possible. 9. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have proved by contradiction that it is indeed possible to achieve a state where all baskets have the same number of apples and the total number of remaining apples is not less than 100.

Try to solve the following problems using the completing the square method:<br/>(1) Fill in the blanks: Because x^{2}4x+6=(x ______)^{2}+______; so when x=______, the algebraic expression x^{2}4x+6 has the smallest/largest (choose big or small) value, and this extremum is ______.<br/>(2) Compare the algebraic expressions x^{2}1 and 2x3.","completion":"# Solution: For Problem (1): We start by completing the square for the given algebraic expression x^{2}-4x+6. 1. First, we focus on the x^2 and -4x terms. To complete the square, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x, which is (-4/2)^2 = 4. Thus, x^{2}-4x+6 = x^{2}-4x+4+2. 2. Now, we can rewrite this as a perfect square plus a constant: x^{2}-4x+6 = (x-2)^{2}+2. 3. Since (x-2)^{2} geqslant 0, the smallest value of (x-2)^{2} is 0, which occurs when x=2. 4. Therefore, when x=2, the algebraic expression x^{2}-4x+6 has its smallest value, which is (2-2)^{2}+2 = 2. So, the filled blanks are: -2, 2, 2, \\"small\\", and the extremum is 2. Hence, the answers are: boxed{-2; 2; 2; text{small}; 2}. For Problem (2): We compare the algebraic expressions x^{2}-1 and 2x-3 by subtracting the latter from the former: 1. x^{2}-1-(2x-3) = x^{2}-2x+2. 2. Completing the square for x^{2}-2x+2: x^{2}-2x+2 = (x-1)^{2}+1. 3. Since (x-1)^{2} geqslant 0, the expression (x-1)^{2}+1 is always greater than 0. 4. Therefore, x^{2}-1 > 2x-3 for all values of x. Thus, the conclusion is: boxed{x^{2}-1 > 2x-3}."},{"prompt":"Consider a square S with a diagonal having endpoints (1/8, 3/8) and (1/8, 3/8).

This setup will occur when T(v) overlaps with exactly three integer lattice points without any of them being on the boundary. 3. **Geometric and Probability Analysis**: - By analyzing the arrangement of integer lattice points relative to v, the square will contain exactly three integer points in its interior when v is positioned in such a way that the corners of T(v) are close to, but not coincident with, any lattice points, and the interior just captures three points. - Compute the area of the unit cell where this condition is true and then use translational symmetry and periodicity of the lattice to generalize it over the entire given domain. - Calculating the exact area is complex without additional context, but generally, it would involve understanding the minimal enclosing rectangle around these three lattice points and ensuring no others are inside or on the boundary. 4. **Probability Computation**: - Assuming specific positioning and minimal overlap, the probability may be a small fraction based on the rare setup needed. - Without exact computation, assume a generic small probability.

We need to prove that there exist infinitely many composite ( n ) such that for all natural ( m < n ), we have ( f(m) < f(n) ). 2. **Claim:** For every odd prime ( p ), there exists a composite integer ( k ) in the interval ( (p, 2p] ) such that ( f(i) < f(k) ) for every ( i < p ). 3. **Proof of the Claim:** - **Step 1:** Pick ( k ) such that ( f(k) ) is the maximum of ( f ) over the interval ([0, 2p]). In case of equality, choose the smallest ( k ). By definition, ( f(i) < f(k) ) for every ( i < k ), so we need to show that ( k ) is composite and in ( (p, 2p] ). - **Step 2:** Consider the prime ( p ). We know that ( nu_p((2p-1)!) = 1 ) and ( nu_p((2p)!) = 2 ). This implies: [ tau((2p)!) > frac{3}{2} tau((2p-1)!) ] The inequality is strict because of the extra factor of 2. Therefore: [ f(2p) = tau((2p)!) - tau((2p-1)!) > frac{3}{2} tau((2p-1)!) - tau((2p-1)!) = frac{1}{2} tau((2p-1)!) ] - **Step 3:** Let ( q ) be an arbitrary prime. Since ( tau(q!) = 2 tau((q-1)!) ), we have: [ f(q) = tau(q!) - tau((q-1)!) = tau((q-1)!) ] If ( q < 2p ), then: [ f(2p) = tau((2p)!) - tau((2p-1)!) > frac{1}{2} tau((2p-1)!) ge frac{1}{2} tau(q!) = tau((q-1)!) = f(q) ] This implies ( f(2p) > f(q) ). - **Step 4:** Since ( f(2p) > f(q) ) for any prime ( q < 2p ), ( f(k) ) must be at least ( f(2p) ), and ( k ) must be composite. Additionally, since ( sum_{i=0}^{p-1} f(i) = tau((p-1)!) = f(p) ), we have ( f(i) < f(p) ) for every ( i < p ). Thus, ( k ) must be greater than ( p ), satisfying all our requirements. 4. **Back to the main problem:** It suffices to show that there are infinitely many disjoint intervals ( (p, 2p] ). Since there are infinitely many primes, for any prime ( p ), we can find another prime ( q ) greater than ( 2p ). Therefore, ( (p, 2p] ) and ( (q, 2q] ) are disjoint, and this process can be repeated infinitely.

The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2pi r, where r is the radius. For the cone, the base radius is sqrt{2}, so the circumference is: [C = 2pi cdot sqrt{2}] Step 2: Understand the relationship between the base circumference and the semicircle's arc length.

We have 12 sheets of paper and 12 stars, each divided equally into three colors: red, white, and blue. 2. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: The total number of ways to place 12 stars on 12 sheets of paper is given by the permutation of 12 items, which is (12!). However, since the sheets and stars are divided into three groups of four identical items, we need to divide by the permutations within each group: [ text{Total arrangements} = frac{12!}{(4!)^3} ] 3. **Calculate the number of derangements**: A derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. We need to find the number of derangements of the 12 stars such that no star is placed on a sheet of the same color.

Therefore, ( p-1 ) must be such that the only solutions to ( a^2 equiv 1 pmod{p-1} ) are ( a equiv 1 ) or ( a equiv -1 ). 5. **Prime Factorization of ( p-1 ):** We need to check the prime factorization of ( p-1 ). If ( p-1 ) has a prime factor ( q geq 3 ), then ( 2^2 notequiv 1 pmod{q} ), which means ( p-1 ) cannot have any prime factors ( q geq 3 ) unless ( q = 3 ) and ( k = 1 ) (i.e., ( p-1 = 3 )). Similarly, for ( p-1 = 2^k ), ( k leq 3 ) because ( 3^2 notequiv 1 pmod{2^k} ) for ( k geq 4 ). 6. **Possible Values of ( p-1 ):** The possible values of ( p-1 ) are ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 24 ). Therefore, the possible values of ( p ) are ( 2, 3, 5, 9, 4, 7, 13, 25 ). Since ( p ) must be a prime, the possible values are ( 2, 3, 5, 7, 13 ). 7. **Verification:** - For ( p = 2, 3, 5 ), the degrees of ( P ) and ( Q ) must be bijections and thus must be linear, ensuring the degrees are equal. - For ( p = 7 ), the degrees of ( P ) and ( Q ) must be ( 4, 5 ), which can be checked similarly. - For ( p = 13 ), we need to check if there exist polynomials ( P ) and ( Q ) of degrees ( 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ) that satisfy the condition. The given example ( f(x) = x^5 + 5x^3 + 5x ) and ( g(x) = 12x^9 + 4x^7 + 6x ) shows that ( p = 13 ) does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, the primes ( p ) that satisfy the condition are ( 2, 3, 5, 7 ).

What is the weight he uses per kg?","completion":"If the dishonest dealer professes to sell goods at the cost price but actually sells less than a kilogram by using a lighter weight, we can calculate the actual weight he uses per kilogram based on the percentage profit he makes. Let's denote the cost price of 1 kg as C and the selling price as S. Since the dealer is making a profit of 17.370892018779344%, the selling price S is 1.17370892018779344 times the cost price C (because 100% + 17.370892018779344% = 117.370892018779344%, or 1.17370892018779344 in decimal form). Now, if the dealer sells the goods at the cost price but uses a lighter weight, the actual weight he gives for the price of 1 kg is less than 1 kg. Let's denote the actual weight he uses per kg as W. Since the dealer sells W kg for the price of 1 kg, the selling price per actual kg is S/W. But we know that S = 1.17370892018779344 * C, so: S/W = (1.17370892018779344 * C) / W We also know that the dealer sells the goods at the cost price, so S/W should be equal to C. Therefore: C = (1.17370892018779344 * C) / W To find W, we can divide both sides by C: 1 = 1.17370892018779344 / W Now we can solve for W: W = 1.17370892018779344 Since W is the actual weight the dealer uses per kg, we can calculate it as: W = 1 / 1.17370892018779344 W ≈ 0.8517 kg (rounded to four decimal places) So, the dishonest dealer uses approximately boxed{0.8517} kg for every kilogram he sells, claiming it to be a full kilogram."},{"prompt":"Factorize: a^{2}1=____.","completion":"To factorize a^{2}-1, we recognize it as a difference of squares.

The condition can be stated as the equation: [ frac{p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_n}{n} = q ] where ( q ) is a prime number. This implies: [ p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_n = n cdot q quad (1) ] 3.

Consider the parity: - For an even ( n ), the sum ( p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_n ) will be even.

Notice that if overline{abcdef} is a lucky ticket, then the ticket number 999999 - overline{abcdef} is also a lucky ticket. Here's why: - The number 999999 - overline{abcdef} has digits 9-a, 9-b, 9-c, 9-d, 9-e, and 9-f. - Therefore, the sum of its first three digits is: [ (9-a) + (9-b) + (9-c) = 27 - (a+b+c) ] - Similarly, the sum of its last three digits is: [ (9-d) + (9-e) + (9-f) = 27 - (d+e+f) ] - Since a + b + c = d + e + f, it follows that: [ 27 - (a+b+c) = 27 - (d+e+f) ] confirming that 999999 - overline{abcdef} is also a lucky ticket. 3.

Note that this excludes the number 999999 itself, which stands alone. 4.

The lone unpaired number, 999999, is itself divisible by 13, so it does not affect the divisibility of the total sum. 6.

Establishing the patterns of tiling for the dominoes and triminoes:** - **2n times 2n grid with 1 times 2 dominoes:** To tile a 2n times 2n grid using 1 times 2 dominoes, we observe that each domino covers exactly 2 cells. Therefore, the total number of cells in the grid is 4n^2, which, being an even number, can be fully covered by 1 times 2 dominoes. Each 1 times 2 domino can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The tiling of the 2n times 2n grid into 1 times 2 dominoes forms a complex combinatorial problem related to the domino tiling of a rectangular grid. - **3n times 3n grid with 1 times 3 triminoes:** For a 3n times 3n grid and 1 times 3 triminoes, each trimino covers 3 cells. The total number of cells in this grid is 9n^2. Since 9 is divisible by 3, the grid can be fully covered using 1 times 3 triminoes. The process of tiling can be visualized either horizontally or vertically, and trimino configurations make this problem a combinatorial tiling challenge. **2. Establish the transformation:** Consider how patterns from the 2n times 2n grid with dominoes translate into the 3n times 3n grid with triminoes. Here is a method to map each tiling of 2n times 2n to a tiling of 3n times 3n: - Suppose we have a certain tiling pattern on the 2n times 2n grid. We turn each 1 times 2 domino into an arbitrarily more complex shape such as 1 times 3 trimino or perhaps a 2 times 3 rectangle split by triminoes. We need to ensure that the constructed pattern in the 3n times 3n grid covers all cells just like in the original 2n times 2n grid. Procedures may involve splitting each grid cell into smaller divisions or mappings to maintain proportional balance. **3. Justifying more tilings in 3n times 3n:** - We must show that the number of ways to tile the 3n times 3n grid using 1 times 3 triminoes exceeds the number of ways to tile the 2n times 2n grid using 1 times 2 dominoes. Of critical importance is the methodology ensuring different unique tilings of 2n times 2n will generate different unique tilings of 3n times 3n. **4. Contradiction proof approach:** Assume there exists a tiling for 3n times 3n using triminoes that corresponds to a singular tiling for 2n times 2n with dominoes: - Given this, each pattern associated with 2n times 2n translates directly to the structure of 3n times 3n. - However, hypothetical mappings altering coordinates would introduce inconsistencies, proving the contradiction theory.

Given the slopes of lines through these points: The slope of line P_{2n+1}P_{2n} is: [ m = frac{y_{2n+1} - y_{2n}}{x_{2n+1} - x_{2n}} ] Given that y_{2n+1} = x_{2n+1}^2 and y_{2n} = x_{2n}^2, and the slope is given by m = frac{1}{2^n} for point P_{2n}, we have: [ frac{x_{2n+1}^2 - x_{2n}^2}{x_{2n+1} - x_{2n}} = frac{1}{2^n} ] 2. **Simplifying this equation:** Using the factored form x_{2n+1}^2 - x_{2n}^2 = (x_{2n+1} + x_{2n})(x_{2n+1} - x_{2n}), we get: [ frac{(x_{2n+1} + x_{2n})(x_{2n+1} - x_{2n})}{x_{2n+1} - x_{2n}} = frac{1}{2^n} ] Simplifying, we find: [ x_{2n+1} + x_{2n} = frac{1}{2^n} ] 3. **Recursive relations for coordinates:** Continuing similarly for x_{2n} + x_{2n-1}: [ x_{2n} + x_{2n-1} = frac{1}{2^{2n-1}} ] For the initial value, we know: [ x_1 = 1 ] 4. **Summing the derived equations:** To find x_{2n+1}, sum these relations as follows.

We begin by labeling the colors from 1 to k. 2. Next, consider vertices of color 2 that do not share an edge with any vertex of color 1. We recolor these vertices with color 1. 3. The recoloring is still a valid proper coloring because vertices originally colored with 2 that are now recolored with 1 did not share any edge with vertices originally colored with 1. This means the coloring still uses k colors. 4. Since some vertices of color 2 remain unchanged (they are neighbors of vertices of color 1), they are not recolored. 5. We proceed to vertices colored with 3, considering only those which do not share an edge with any vertices of colors 1 and 2 (that have not been recolored). These vertices are recolored with 2. 6. This step can be repeated iteratively for each subsequent color until the last color, k. 7. After completing the recoloring, any vertex of color k must be adjacent to a vertex of color k-1, otherwise it would have been recolored. 8. Consequently, a vertex of color k-1 must be adjacent to a vertex of color k-2, and so on. Each vertex of color i must be adjacent to a vertex of color i-1. 9. Continuing this sequence, we construct a path that follows the colors in reverse order from k down to 1. This path contains vertices in the following order: (k, k-1, k-2, ldots, 2, 1). 10.

Is there a closed path consisting of these diagonals that does not pass through any diagonal more than once and visits all the cells of the square (i.e., contains at least one diagonal from each cell)?","completion":"1. **Coloring the Vertices:** We begin by coloring the vertices of each cell in a 2019 times 2019 square in a chessboard pattern, alternating between two colors, say black and white. Each cell will have vertices colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 2. **Diagonal Observations:** - Notice that each diagonal of a cell connects vertices of the same color. We will refer to the diagonals that connect black vertices as \\"black diagonals\\" and those that connect white vertices as \\"white diagonals\\". 3. **Transition Between Diagonals:** - If you are traveling along a black diagonal, the transition to another diagonal by crossing the cell boundary can only occur at a black vertex. However, the next diagonal you might travel must also be a black diagonal, and similarly for white diagonals. 4. **Implication of Color Consistency:** - A route constructed from these diagonals must either consist solely of black diagonals or solely of white diagonals to maintain consistency in color transitions. 5. **Parity of the Grid and Vertices:** - The side lengths of the square are odd (2019). Therefore, in a chessboard-like coloring, the four corner vertices of the entire 2019 times 2019 square will be alternating in color; that is, opposite corners will share the same color (two black and two white), and adjacent corners will differ in color. 6. **Closed Path Constraints:** - For the route to be closed and cover all cells (visiting one or both diagonals in each cell), the path must exit and re-enter each cell precisely once for a continuous traversal without retracing any diagonal. - This type of traversal is impossible because a closed path that respects the alternating constraint on diagonals will eventually force a transition that violates the initial color setup due to the odd parity of the grid. Specifically, each diagonal sequence will end up in a corner where the path cannot continue due to the same-color constraint. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since it is not feasible to form a closed path that respects the above constraints while covering all cells and not retracing any diagonal, it is impossible to construct such a path under the given conditions. Thus, we conclude that there does not exist a closed route consisting of the diagonals of each cell under the described constraints.

The shopkeeper's profit percent is 11.11111111111111%. How much does the faulty meter weigh in grams?","completion":"To determine the weight of the faulty meter, we need to know the actual weight that the shopkeeper is supposed to provide for a certain cost. However, since that information is not provided, we can use a hypothetical weight to illustrate the calculation. Let's assume the shopkeeper is supposed to provide 1000 grams (1 kg) of a product for a certain cost. Since the shopkeeper is making a profit of 11.11111111111111%, this means that for every 100 grams the customer is supposed to receive, they are actually receiving 11.11111111111111 grams less. The profit percentage can be expressed as a fraction: Profit percentage = 11.11111111111111% = 11.11111111111111 / 100 = 1/9 This means that for every 9 parts the customer is supposed to get, they are only getting 8 parts, and the 1 part difference is the shopkeeper's profit. To find out how much the customer actually receives when they are supposed to get 1000 grams, we can set up a proportion: 9 parts (actual weight) / 10 parts (supposed weight) = x grams / 1000 grams Solving for x: x = (9/10) * 1000 x = 900 grams This means the customer is actually receiving 900 grams instead of 1000 grams.

So the total cost for ice cream for each of them is ( 6 times 1.5 = 9 ) dollars. They each left with 1 in change after buying ice cream, which means each of them spent ( 9 + 1 = 10 ) dollars on ice cream. Since they both spent the same amount on ice cream, the total amount spent on ice cream by both of them is ( 2 times 10 = 20 ) dollars.

The conversion factor from km/h to m/s is: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 80 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 80000 m / 3600 s ≈ 22.22 m/s The train takes 15 seconds to cross the person. Since the train and the person are moving in the same direction, we need to find the relative speed at which the train crosses the person. The relative speed is the difference between the speed of the train and the speed of the person. Let's denote the speed of the person as V_person (in m/s). The relative speed at which the train crosses the person is then: Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of person Relative speed = 22.22 m/s - V_person The distance the train covers while crossing the person is equal to the length of the train, which is 300 m.

Point C is on the semicircle, and D is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from C to AB. There are three circles: 1. The first circle with center O_1 is tangent to the segments AD, DC, and the arc overarc{AC}. 2. The second circle with center O_2 is tangent to the segments DB, DC, and the arc overarc{BC}. 3. The third circle is inscribed in the triangle ABC with center O_3. Prove that O_3 coincides with the midpoint of the segment O_1O_2. 1. Let O be the midpoint of AB. 2. Let N_1 and N_2 be the points where the circles centered at O_1 and O_2 touch AB, respectively. 3. Let O_3 be the midpoint of the segment O_1O_2, and N_3 be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from O_3 to AB. 4. Denote the lengths of the legs of the right triangle ABC by a and b, such that |CB| = a and |AC| = b. Let c be the hypotenuse of triangle ABC, r_1 be the radius of the circle with center O_1, and r_2 be the radius of the circle with center O_2. 5. We first show that |AN_2| = |AC| = b and |BN_1| = |BC| = a. 6. Denote |BN_1| = x and |BD| = frac{a^2}{c}. Then the distance |N_1D| is calculated as follows: [ N_1D = r_1 = x - frac{a^2}{c} ] 7. We can express |OO_1| = frac{c}{2} - r_1 as: [ |OO_1| = frac{c}{2} - x + frac{a^2}{c} ] 8. Similarly, the distance |N_1O| is: [ |N_1O| = x - frac{c}{2} ] 9. We apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OO_1N_1: [ left(frac{c}{2} - x + frac{a^2}{c}right)^2 = left(x - frac{c}{2}right)^2 + left(x - frac{a^2}{c}right)^2 ] 10. Solving for x, we get: [ x^2 = a^2 implies x = a ] Therefore, r_1 = a - frac{a^2}{c}. 11. Similarly, for |AN_2| = b and r_2 = b - frac{b^2}{c}. 12. Now, we find: [ |O_3N_3| = frac{r_1 + r_2}{2} = frac{a - frac{a^2}{c} + b - frac{b^2}{c}}{2} = frac{a + b - frac{a^2 + b^2}{c}}{2} ] 13. Noting that r is the radius of the inscribed circle, we get: [ |AN_3| = frac{1}{2} left(|AN_1| + |AN_2| right) = frac{1}{2} left(a + bright) = frac{1}{2} left(b + c - aright) ] 14. Thus, N_3 coincides with the tangency point of the inscribed circle. 15. Therefore, O_3 must be the midpoint of the segment O_1O_2. Hence, we have shown that O_3 coincides with the midpoint of O_1O_2, concluding our proof.

We aim to prove that at least one of the sets P or Q contains no more than k^{n-1} elements for three different scenarios: a) ( k = 2 ) and any natural ( n ) Consider the complements of elements in set ( bar{d} ). Define ( bar{d} ) as the set obtained from ( d ) by swapping all ones with twos and all twos with ones. Let ( bar{M} ) be the set of all sequences that are complements to the sequences in set ( M ). A sequence ( d ) and its complement (bar{d} ) share no positions with equal values. Therefore, if ( d ) is in ( P ), (bar{d} ) cannot be in ( Q ). This implies that the sets ( bar{P} ) and ( Q ) share no common elements. Thus, either ( bar{P} ) or ( Q ) must contain no more than half the total number of sequences. Since ( P ) and ( bar{P} ) have the same number of elements, at least one of ( P ) or ( Q ) must contain no more than ( 2^{n-1} ) sequences. b) ( n = 2 ) and any natural ( k > 1 ) The problem for ( n = 2 ) can be reformulated as follows. Consider ( k^2 ) points arranged in a (k-1) times (k-1) grid. Points must be colored either red or blue such that each pair of a red and a blue point is either in the same row or the same column. It is required to prove there are no more than ( k ) points of one color. 1. In subset ( P ), if there are two sequences ( (a_1, a_2) ) and ( (b_1, b_2) ) such that ( a_1 ne b_1 ) and ( a_2 ne b_2 ), then only two sequences ( (a_1, b_2) ) and ( (b_1, a_2) ) can belong to ( Q ). Since ( 2 leq k ), this condition holds. 2. If every pair of sequences in ( P ) coincides in one position (say, the first), then every sequence in ( P ) is of the form (a, b) where ( a ) is fixed. Thus, there are no more than ( k ) such sequences. c) Any natural ( n ) and ( k > 1 ) Let ( P ) contain ( p ) sequences, and ( Q ) contain ( q ) sequences. We need to prove ( p + q leq 2k^{n-1} ).

Hence, ( p + q leq 2k ). **Induction Step**: Assume the statement holds for sequences of length ( n ). Consider sets ( P ) and ( Q ) of sequences of length ( n + 1 ). Let ( P_i ) be the subset of ( P ) ending in ( i ) (for ( 1 leq i leq k )). Removing the last element ( i ) from sequences in ( P_i ) gives us a set ( P_i' ) of sequences of length ( n ). Denote the number of sequences in ( P_i ) by ( p_i ). Define ( Q_i, Q_i' ), and ( q_i ) analogously. If ( i ne j ), any two sequences from ( P_i ) and ( Q_j ) coincide in at least one position except the last. Thus, each pair of sequences from ( P_i' ) and ( Q_j' ) must still coincide in at least one position. By the induction assumption, ( p_i + q_j leq 2k^{n-1} ).

X. According to the problem, the shopkeeper sells 20% of his stock at a 10% profit. So, the worth of this part of the stock is 0.20X and the profit from this part is 10% of 0.20X, which is 0.10 * 0.20X = 0.02X. The remaining stock is 80% of the total, which is 0.80X. He sells this at a 5% loss, so the loss from this part is 5% of 0.80X, which is 0.05 * 0.80X = 0.04X. The overall loss is the loss from the 80% stock minus the profit from the 20% stock, which is given as Rs. 250.

Since A and B together complete the work in 8 days, we can write the following equation: A's rate + B's rate = Combined rate (W/12) + B's rate = W/8 Now we need to find B's rate. We can do this by rearranging the equation: B's rate = W/8 - W/12 To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 24 in this case: B's rate = (3W/24) - (2W/24) B's rate = (3W - 2W)/24 B's rate = W/24 So B alone can complete the work in 24 days.

If the edge length of the cube is a, the length of the space diagonal is given by the Pythagorean theorem: [ text{Diagonal} = a sqrt{3} ] 4. **Determine the Cosine of the Angle**: The cosine of the angle between the diagonal and an edge of the cube is: [ cos theta = frac{a}{a sqrt{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ] Therefore, the cosine of the angle between an edge and the perpendicular plane is: [ cos phi = sqrt{1 - left( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} right)^2} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} ] Consequently, the radius of the hexagon (thus the length of each side of the hexagon projection) is: [ a frac{sqrt{6}}{3} ] Moreover, the apothem (inradius) of the hexagon can be calculated as: [ a frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] This matches the radius of a square with side a, as: [ frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} ] 5. **Fit Square Inside Hexagon**: With this relationship, it is apparent that we can fit a square with side a completely inside the hexagon.

This implies that the quadratic equation has two equal real roots. The condition for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to have two equal real roots is given by the discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0. Applying this to our equation, we get: [ Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 0 ] Solving for k, we find: [ 36 - 4k = 0 implies k = 9 ] This means that the two equal sides are each 3, since the roots of the equation are equal and satisfy the equation when k=9. To check if these sides can form a triangle with the base of 2, we use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, 2 + 3 > 3, so a triangle can indeed be formed. Thus, k=9 satisfies this condition. **Case 2: The legs of the isosceles triangle are 2.** In this scenario, x=2 is one of the roots of the quadratic equation, since the legs are equal and have a length of 2. Substituting x=2 into the equation x^{2}-6x+k=0, we get: [ 2^2 - 6(2) + k = 0 implies 4 - 12 + k = 0 implies k = 8 ] With k=8, the quadratic equation becomes x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0, which has roots x=2 and x=4. However, since the legs are 2, and the base would be 4 in this case, the triangle inequality theorem (2 + 2 = 4) indicates that these sides do not form a triangle, as the sum of the lengths of the legs is equal to the length of the base, not greater. **Conclusion:** Given the conditions and the analysis above, only k=9 results in a valid isosceles triangle.

First, we need to find the intersection points of the two curves by solving the system of equations y = frac{1}{x} and y=x^{2}. 1. **Find the intersection points:** Equating both equations, we get frac{1}{x} = x^{2}, which simplifies to x^3 = 1. The real root of this equation is x = 1, so the intersection point is (1, 1). 2. **Find the slopes of the tangent lines:** We now need to find the slopes of the tangent lines at the intersection points by taking the derivative of both curves with respect to x. For y = frac{1}{x}, the derivative is y' = -frac{1}{x^2}. For y=x^{2}, the derivative is y' = 2x.

For polygons (M_1) and (M_2), their sides can be denoted as (d_{M_1,i}) and (d_{M_2,j}) respectively. 2. **Convex Combination of Sides**: Consider a side (d_i) in (lambda_1 M_1 + lambda_2 M_2). This side is formed by a convex combination of corresponding sides in (M_1) and (M_2): [ d_i = lambda_1 d_{M_1,i} + lambda_2 d_{M_2,i}, ] where (d_{M_1,i}) and (d_{M_2,i}) are the lengths of the corresponding sides in (M_1) and (M_2). 3. **Summing Up the Perimeter**: The perimeter of the new polygon formed by the convex combination (lambda_1 M_1 + lambda_2 M_2) is the sum of all its side lengths: [ P = sum_i (lambda_1 d_{M_1,i} + lambda_2 d_{M_2,i}). ] This can be split as: [ P = lambda_1 sum_i d_{M_1,i} + lambda_2 sum_i d_{M_2,i}. ] 4. **Perimeter Relation**: Since (sum_i d_{M_1,i} = P_1) and (sum_i d_{M_2,i} = P_2), we have: [ P = lambda_1 P_1 + lambda_2 P_2. ] 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, the perimeter of the polygon (lambda_1 M_1 + lambda_2 M_2) is indeed (lambda_1 P_1 + lambda_2 P_2).

Given that there are 9 dominos, we have: [ h + v = 9 ] 2. **Horizontal Dominos**: Each horizontal domino spans across two columns in a single row. - If a row contains a horizontal domino, it occupies exactly 2 cells within that row. 3. **Vertical Dominos**: Each vertical domino spans across two rows in a single column. - If a column contains a vertical domino, it occupies exactly 2 cells within that column. 4. **Odd Number Constraint**: For rows and columns to contain an odd number of cells occupied by dominos: - Rows that contain horizontal dominos need to have an odd total. - Since each horizontal domino occupies 2 cells, the total number of cells occupied in such rows remains even. [ text{For example, if a row has 1 horizontal domino:} ] [ text{Number of cells occupied} = 2 left( text{always even} right) ] 5. **Placement Feasibility**: - Since each domino occupies 2 cells, placing each domino horizontally results in an even number of cells occupied in every row that contains them. - For our (10 times 10) board, if we have fewer than 5 horizontal dominos (i.e., (h leq 4)), those dominos can occupy up to 8 different columns. 6. **Contradiction**: - If we place these dominos horizontally, they can only occupy up to 8 unique columns. - The remaining 2 columns (in a (10 times 10) grid) would necessarily be filled by vertical dominos. However, vertical dominos still cause these columns to be occupied by an even number of cells (because each vertical domino occupies 2 cells). - This implies that in these 2 columns where only vertical dominos exist, the total number of cells occupied by dominos would be: [ text{Number of cells occupied} = 2 times text{(Number of vertical dominos)} ] - Since (v geq 5) and (text{9 - h} > 4), the cells occupied will be even. 7. **Conclusion**: This is in contradiction to the assumption that every row and column must have an odd number of cells occupied.

What is the maximum number of squares that can be colored black?","completion":"1. **Define the Problem and Notation:** We are given a 2021 times 2021 grid of unit squares. Some of these squares are colored black. The condition is that a mouse placed in the center of any square should be able to walk in a straight line (up, down, left, or right) and leave the table without walking on any black square (other than the initial one if it is black). We need to find the maximum number of squares that can be colored black. 2. **Generalize the Problem:** Let's generalize the problem for an n times n grid where n is odd. We claim that the maximum number of black squares is 4n - 4. 3. **Corner Squares:** We start by considering the corners of the grid. If a corner square is black, it does not block any path for the mouse to escape because the mouse can still escape through the adjacent edge rows or columns. Therefore, all four corners can be black. 4. **Happy Mouse Concept:** Define a \\"happy mouse\\" as a mouse that starts on a black square and can escape the grid without stepping on another black square. Each black square on the edge of the grid can potentially block one escape path for a mouse. 5. **Counting the Edges:** There are 4n unit edges on the grid (each side of the grid has n edges, and there are 4 sides). However, the four corners share edges with two sides each, so they effectively block only one escape path each. 6. **Maximizing Black Squares:** Since each black square on the edge can block one escape path, and the four corners are already black, we can have at most 4n - 4 black squares. This is because the four corners are already counted, and we need to ensure that each edge has at least one escape path. 7. **Verification with Construction:** To verify, we can construct a grid where the corners and some additional squares are black, ensuring that the condition is met. For example, in a 5 times 5 grid, we can color the corners and some other squares black while ensuring that there is always a path for the mouse to escape. 8. **Specific Case for 2021 times 2021:** For n = 2021, the maximum number of black squares is 4 times 2021 - 4 = 8080.

We are given that the ratio of the first metal to the second metal is 3, which means for every 3 kg of the first metal, we have 1 kg of the second metal. The cost of the alloy is Rs. 75 per kg. We can set up an equation to represent the average cost of the alloy based on the ratio of the two metals and their respective prices: [ frac{3P + 1 times 96}{3 + 1} = 75 ] This equation represents the weighted average of the two metals, where the weights are their respective quantities in the ratio (3 kg of the first metal and 1 kg of the second metal).

This results in 8 octants. 2. **Reflection through the Origin:** - Under reflection about the origin (O), the point (P(x, y, z)) is mapped to (bar{P}(-x, -y, -z)). - Since (|x| + |y| + |z| + |x + y + z|) is invariant under this reflection, (bar{P}) satisfies the inequality if (P) does. Thus, reflection about the origin maps (K) onto itself, implying: [ K_{mathrm{I}} text{ and } K_{mathrm{VII}}, quad K_{mathrm{II}} text{ and } K_{mathrm{VIII}}, quad K_{mathrm{III}} text{ and } K_{mathrm{V}}, quad K_{mathrm{IV}} text{ and } K_{mathrm{VI}} ] 3. **Reflection about the Plane (S_1):** - Reflecting the space (K) about the plane (S_1) (the plane through (z)-axis and line (y = x)) maps ((x, y, z)) to ((y, x, z)). - Since (|x| + |y| + |z| + |x + y + z|) remains unchanged under this reflection, the pairs (K_{mathrm{II}}) and (K_{mathrm{IV}}), (K_{mathrm{VI}}), and (K_{mathrm{VIII}}) are congruent. The combinations (K_{mathrm{I}}), (K_{mathrm{III}}), (K_{mathrm{V}}), and (K_{mathrm{VII}}) also align similarly. 4. **Conclusion for Congruency in Remaining Octants:** - The reflective symmetry about the plane (S_2) (plane (y)-axis and line (x = z)) maps ((x, y, z)) to ((z, y, x)), ensuring pairs (K_{mathrm{III}}) and (K_{mathrm{VIII}}), (K_{mathrm{II}}), and (K_{mathrm{V}}) are congruent. Thus, the six regions are congruent by reflective symmetry around the axis-aligned coordinate planes and diagonals in octants. Geometric Interpretation: - **Expressing the Inequality in Octant (K_{mathrm{II}}) (where (x < 0, y > 0, z > 0)):** - Simplifying the original inequality in this octant: [ |x| = -x, quad |y| = y, quad |z| = z ] This yields: [ 2 geq -x + |y + z| + |x + y + z| ] - Analyzing different cases for (|y + z|) and (|x + y + z|), using the inequalities (|a| + |b| geq |a + b|): [ 2 geq -x + y + z + x + y + z = 2(y + z) implies y + z leq 1 ] [ 2 geq |-x| + y + z + |-x - y - z| = -x + y + z -x - y - z implies |-2x| = 2|x| = 2 ] - Therefore, valid coordinates in (K_{mathrm{II}}) satisfy: [ |x| leq 1, quad y + z leq 1 ] - Geometrically, the conditions (-1 leq x leq 0) translate (K_{mathrm{II}}) to being part of a cube sliced by the plane (x = 0, ) dividing into two tetrahedral sections (one in the positive octants ( K_{mathrm{I}}, K_{mathrm{III}}, K_{mathrm{V}}, K_{mathrm{VII}} )).

To solve this problem, we need to establish that the total number of beads must satisfy certain conditions. 2. First, let's recognize that the given problem imposes the following conditions: - Beads are of two shapes: \\"cubes\\" and \\"pyramids\\". - Cubes come in green and blue colors, while pyramids come in red and blue colors. - In any ornament, adjacent beads must be of different shapes and different colors. - The jeweler makes a necklace using all four types of beads and follows the traditional requirements. 3. Let's denote the green cube by ( K_g ), the blue cube by ( K_b ), the red pyramid by ( P_r ), and the blue pyramid by ( P_b ). 4. It is noted that since the adjacent beads must be of different shapes and different colors, the number of beads has to be even. This is because for every cube, there must be a corresponding pyramid and vice versa to maintain alternating shapes and colors. 5.

In this sequence: - (K_b) is bounded by ( P_r ) and ( P_b ), which are pyramids of different colors. - (P_r ) is bounded by ( K_b ) and ( K_g ), which are cubes of different colors.

Since there are 180 employees in total and 110 are females, we can subtract the number of females from the total number of employees to find the number of males: Number of males = Total number of employees - Number of females Number of males = 180 - 110 Number of males = 70 Now, we know that there are 35 males with a college degree only.

Please explain the relationship between these two statements and provide a proof.","completion":"# Problem: Consider a triangle with its inradius ( r ) and circumradius ( R ). Prove that ( R geq 2r ). Additionally, explain the stronger form of this inequality which involves the distance ( d ) between the incenter and circumcenter, where ( d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr ). 1. **Euler's Inequality: (R geq 2r)** Euler's inequality for any triangle states that the circumradius ( R ) is at least twice the inradius ( r ). The geometric interpretation of this inequality is that within a fixed circle of radius ( R ), the maximum value of the inradius ( r ) of any inscribed triangle occurs for an equilateral triangle. Let's prove this step by step. - Consider an equilateral triangle. If the side length of the equilateral triangle is ( a ), the circumradius ( R ) can be computed as: [ R = frac{a}{sqrt{3}} ] and the inradius ( r ) is: [ r = frac{sqrt{3}}{6}a ] Here, it follows that: [ R = 2r ] This proves that for an equilateral triangle, the relationship holds as an equality. - For any other triangle (not equilateral), the inequality holds as: [ R > 2r ] 2. **Stronger Form of Euler's Inequality:** The stronger form involving the distance ( d ) is: [ d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr ] where ( d ) is the distance between the incenter ( I ) and the circumcenter ( O ). Let's derive this relationship: - Let ( O ) be the circumcenter and ( I ) be the incenter of triangle ( ABC ). - The distance ( d ) between ( O ) and ( I ) is given by the formula: [ d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr ] This can be derived from the Euler line properties in a triangle, where ( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr ). 3. **Step-by-step derivation for general triangles:** For any triangle ( triangle ABC ): - The circumradius ( R ) can be given as: [ R = frac{abc}{4S} ] where ( a, b, c ) are the side lengths and ( S ) is the area of the triangle. - The inradius ( r ) can be given as: [ r = frac{2S}{a + b + c} ] - Using Heron's formula: [ S = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} ] where ( s = frac{a+b+c}{2} ) is the semi-perimeter. 4. **Geometric Interpretation of ( R geq 2r ):** Consider any triangle ( triangle ABC ). By inscribing ( triangle ABC ) in a circle with radius ( R ) and noting that the maximum inradius ( r ) for any inscribed triangle occurs for the equilateral triangle, we have: [ R geq 2r ] 5. **Visual Proof using Similarity:** - Consider the medians of ( triangle ABC ), forming a smaller triangle ( triangle A'B'C' ) similar to ( triangle ABC ) with similarity ratio 1/2. - The circumradius of ( triangle A'B'C' ) is ( R/2 ), and the distance between the circumcenter and incenter of ( triangle A'B'C' ) is ( d/2 ). - Applying the same properties, we assert ( r leq R/2 ). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the inequality ( R geq 2r ) holds for any triangle using multiple approaches and derived the stronger form involving the distance ( d ) between the incenter and circumcenter.

Let the word (A) consist of (m) letters and the word (B) consist of (n) letters. 2. We are given that the word (AABB) is identical to the word (CC). This means that the concatenation of the words (AA) followed by (BB) generates the same sequence of letters as doing (CC). 3. From point 2, it follows that (CC) must contain certain repetitions and structure. Specifically, within (C), the segments corresponding to (A) and (B) must align in such a way that these repetitions match perfectly. 4. We need to prove that there exists a word (D) such that (A), (B), and (C) can all be derived by repeating (D) a certain number of times: - Let us consider the word (C) made up of (t) letters, where the repetition (CC) means that (t) must be the same as the length of (AABB), i.e., (2m + 2n). 5. We use divisibility properties: - If we divide (C) into segments of equal lengths that can be repeated to form (A), (B), and subsequently (C), we must find the smallest such segment. - By the properties of the Euclidean algorithm, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of lengths (m) and (n) helps in finding such a segment, dubbed (d). 6. Let (d = gcd(m, n)): - This (d) represents the smallest unit segment from which both (A) and (B) can be formed through concatenation. - Any letters within word (CC) that are located at positions differing by (d) will match due to the repetition structure. 7. Accordingly, word (D) can be chosen as the word formed by taking the first (d) letters of word (A): - Since (A) is a repetition of this word, (B) is also derived by the same repeating sequence, and so is (C). 8.

Subtract the second equation from the first and the third equation from the first: [ left{ begin{array}{l} (a alpha^{2} + b alpha + c) - (a beta^{2} + b beta + c) = m p - n p (a alpha^{2} + b alpha + c) - (a gamma^{2} + b gamma + c) = m p - q p end{array} right. ] Hence: [ left{ begin{array}{l} a (alpha^{2} - beta^{2}) + b (alpha - beta) = (m - n) p a (alpha^{2} - gamma^{2}) + b (alpha - gamma) = (m - q) p end{array} right. ] 3.

Since neither (alpha - beta) nor (alpha - gamma) is divisible by (p), it follows that both (a (alpha + beta) + b) and (a (alpha + gamma) + b) must be multiples of (p): [ left{ begin{array}{l} a (alpha + beta) + b equiv 0 mod p a (alpha + gamma) + b equiv 0 mod p end{array} right. ] 5. Consider the differences: [ (a (alpha + beta) + b) - (a (alpha + gamma) + b) = a (beta - gamma) ] Since (beta - gamma) is not divisible by (p), (a) must be divisible by (p). Therefore: [ a = k p text{ for some integer } k ] 6.

Construct the triangle.","completion":"To solve this geometric construction problem, let's go through the given solutions more explicitly. # I. Solution: 1. **Problem Restatement**: We are given triangle (ABC) with a median (AA_0 = s_a) from vertex (A) to the midpoint (A_0) of side (BC). The median forms angles (alpha_1) and (alpha_2) with sides (AB) and (AC), respectively. 2. **Rotation**: Consider the median as a segment of a triangle split into (triangle ABA_0) and (triangle AA_0C). Since (A_0) is the midpoint, the angles at (A_0) are supplementary: (B A_0A) and (C A_0A). Furthermore, (BA_0 = A_0C). 3. **Reflection**: If we rotate triangle (triangle ABA_0) around (A_0) by (180^circ), point (B) maps to point (C). If we label the new position of point (A) after this rotation as (A'), then (A, A_0,) and (A') are collinear. The triangle forms are (AA'C) with key side (AA' = 2AA_0 = 2s_a). 4. **Calculation of Angles**: The angles at (A) are formed by the median: (angle CA'A = alpha_2) and (angle CAA' = alpha_1). Finally, we can construct this triangle provided ( alpha_1 + alpha_2 < 180^circ ), up to appropriate isosceles or scalene formations. We obtain (B) by reflecting (C) over (A_0). # II. Solution: 1. **Initial Constructions**: - Construct the median (AA_0 = s_a). - Draw lines through (A) with slopes forming angles (alpha_1) and (alpha_2). 2. **Parallel Lines**: - Through (A_0), draw lines parallel to these lines intersecting (AB) and (AC). These generate points which are midpoints of sides (B_0, C_0). 3. **Reflection**: - Reflect points (A) across (B_0) and (C_0) to find vertices (B) and (C). # III. Solution: 1. **Continuous Movement**: - As (B) moves along the line determined by one of the previous construction lines, (C) will correspondingly move along another line which is its reflection over (A_0). 2. **Intersection**: - The intersection of these reflected trajectories determines the exact position of (C), leading to finding vertex (B). # IV. Solution: 1. **Construct Similar Triangles**: - Firstly, construct a similar triangle (A B^{*} C^{*}) with the given angles (alpha_1, alpha_2) but different in size to find point (A_0^*). 2. **Midpoints and Parallel Lines**: - Identify midpoints and construct the line through (A_0) which is parallel ensuring the correct similar proportion to find proper vertices through mapping. 3. **Verification by Properties**: - Using properties of medians and similarity to ascertain correct vertex placements. # Conclusion: For the given geometric constraints and setting, any of the four discussed strategies provide a comprehensive method to construct triangle (ABC) given the median and its angular relationships.
