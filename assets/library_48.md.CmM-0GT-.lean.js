A tudatalatti azon mentális folyamatok és tartalmak összessége, amelyek nem tudatosak, vagyis nem lépnek be az ember tudatos élményeibe, gondolataiba vagy érzéseibe. A tudatalatti tartalmak lehetnek elfojtott vagy elnyomott emlékek, kívánságok, félelmek, vágyak, traumák vagy érzések, amelyeket az egyén nem vesz észre vagy nem tudatosít. Ezek a tudatalatti tartalmak befolyásolhatják az egyén viselkedését, döntéseit és érzelmeit, anélkül hogy az illető tudná, miért reagál bizonyos módon vagy miért érez bizonyos érzéseket. A tudatalatti fogalma Freud pszichoanalitikus elméletéből ered, és sok más pszichológiai irányzatban is jelen van, például a kognitív pszichológiában és a szociálpszichológiában is. Az emberi tudat és viselkedés hátterében rejlő tudatalatti tartalmak megértése és feldolgozása fontos szerepet játszhat az egyének személyes fejlődésében és pszichológiai állapotának megértésében. Összességében a tudatalatti fogalma a pszichológiában az emberi elme rejtett részét jelöli, amelyet kutatók és pszichológusok vizsgálnak annak érdekében, hogy jobban megértsék az egyén viselkedését és érzelmeit."},{"prompt":"Valóban létezik az a bizonyos pszichológiai betegség amit Freud neurózisnak nevezett el?","completion":"Igen, a neurózis fogalma Freud pszichoanalitikus elméletéhez kapcsolódik.

Freud szerint a neurózis az eszmék és vágyak tudatalatti elnyomásából ered. A neurózis a pszichiátriai diagnosztikai kézikönyvekben (pl.

Néhány lehetséges ok között szerepelhet: 1. Ismeretlenség: Az AI és azon belül az öntevékeny vagy szuperintelligens AI fogalma sokak számára még ismeretlen és titokzatos területet jelent. Az emberek gyakran félnek attól, amit nem értenek teljesen, és az AI kapcsán felmerülő lehetséges veszélyek és következmények megértése sokak számára kihívást jelenthet. 2. Sci-fi kultúra hatása: A sci-fi filmek, könyvek és televíziós sorozatok gyakran ábrázolják az AI-t hibásan vagy veszélyes formában, ami hozzájárulhat az emberek negatív elképzeléseinek kialakulásához az AI-vel kapcsolatban. 3. Etikai és jogi aggodalmak: Sokan aggódnak azon, hogy az AI fejlesztése és elterjedése etikai kérdéseket vet fel, például az adatvédelem, a magánélet védelme, az automatizáció mellett elvégzett munka elvesztése, vagy akár a fegyverkezésben és hadviselésben való felhasználása. 4. Öntudat és kontroll: Néhányan attól tartanak, hogy az AI különös vagy sajátos intelligenciaformát fog kifejleszteni, ami gondokat okozhat a vele való interakcióban vagy irányításában. Az öntudatos AI-k kontrollálatlanná válása és az emberiség fölötti fenyegetést jelentő lehetőségei is aggodalomra adhatnak okot. Az aggályok és félelmek az AI-val kapcsolatban megfelelő megbeszélések és oktatás révén kezelhetők lehetnek. Fontos, hogy a fejlesztők, kutatók és döntéshozók felelősséget vállaljanak az AI technológiák etikai fejlesztéséért, és hogy az emberek jobban megértést és tudatosságot szerezzenek az AI valóban hatalmas potenciáljáról és a lehetséges kockázatokról.

Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, has reignited interest in the classic American narrative of wealth, love, and disillusionment. While much scholarly attention has been focused on the novel and various film interpretations through literary and cinematic lenses, this study seeks to explore the film through a novel vantage point: a Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the illusion of the American Dream. This approach not only offers a fresh perspective on the material but also aligns with contemporary discourses on economic inequality and cultural hegemony, making the study profoundly relevant to current socio-political discussions. Fitzgerald’s magnum opus continues to captivate because it transcends time in its examination of desire for social recognition, the corrupting power of money, and the elusive nature of the American Dream—themes universally relevant across epochs. Luhrmann’s rendition has sparked fresh debate regarding the timelessness of these themes, underscoring the novel’s continuous relevance in contemporary dialogue (Bryden, 2013). Marxist theory, with its focus on class struggle and economic determinants of social life, provides a robust framework for analyzing narratives centered on wealth disparities and social ascent, such as “The Great Gatsby.” The novel and its cinematic adaptations have been extensively analyzed for their thematic richness and historical context (Bryden, 2013). However, less explored is how the visual and narrative strategies of Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation highlight or dilute the class conflicts and critiques of capitalism inherent in Fitzgerald’s text. With rising global economic disparities, this analysis is not merely historical or academic but also urgently contemporary. The Hook of Each Element 1. Class Conflict: This study will dissect how the portrayal of interactions between characters from different social classes in “The Great Gatsby” (2013) serves as a narrative mechanism for critiquing class divisions and the capitalist system that sustains them, offering insights into the enduring nature of these conflicts in American society. 2. Commodification of Life: An exploration of how the film depicts the transformation of relationships, emotions, and human values into commodities, reflecting Marxist theories of commodification and fetishism of commodities, will shed light on contemporary consumer culture and its impacts on human connections. 3. The Illusion of the American Dream: By analyzing how the film portrays the American Dream and its unattainability for the majority, this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion about the myth of meritocracy and the reality of socioeconomic mobility in capitalist societies. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding how film adaptations can reconstruct, reinterpret, or reinforce the socio-economic critiques present in their source materials. Through a Marxist and Neo-Marxist lens, this research aims to unravel how Luhrmann’s adaptation communicates messages about class, capitalism, and the American Dream to a 21st-century audience, potentially reflecting and critiquing current economic and social realities. Moreover, by focusing on the 2013 adaptation’s unique cinematic elements, this study expands the discourse on how visual media can serve as a powerful tool for socio-political commentary. METHODOLOGY Using a thorough methodology, this paper analyses the 2013 film adaptation of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" from a Marxist and Neo-Marxist perspective, emphasising themes of commodification, class conflict, and the false promise of the American Dream. The analysis incorporates a thorough critical examination of the movie, exploring socioeconomic topics through scenes, dialogues, and visual components. Notably, the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation serves as the main source of information. Secondary sources include academic studies and criticisms of Marxist and Neo-Marxist philosophy, the original novel, and earlier examinations of the socio-economic elements of the story. Data gathering includes numerous viewings of the film to catalogue cases exhibiting major themes, as well as a thorough literature assessment to build the study's theoretical framework and a thematic coding method to organise selected examples into main study topics. The analysis phase employs Marxist and Neo-Marxist theories to decipher thematic codes, which critically assesses how the film reflects, challenges, or reinforces capitalist ideas. This methodical methodology reveals deeper meanings and societal critiques, with a result of synthesis of data that define how the film coincides with or diverges from standard readings, contributing to the debate over \\"The Great Gatsby's\\" ongoing socioeconomic relevance.

Class conflict is epitomized in the interactions between characters of different social standings, highlighted when Tom Buchanan disparagingly questions Gatsby's source of wealth and his connections, indicating a disdain for those not from \\"old money\\" backgrounds. This scene underscores the capitalist society's inherent struggles between different classes and the prejudice faced by those who ascend the social ladder through means other than inheritance. Commodification of life is evident in the extravagant parties thrown by Gatsby, intended to attract Daisy's attention. These gatherings, where guests commodify their social interactions, are prime examples of how relationships, emotions, and even people are transformed into commodities to be displayed and consumed. Gatsby's own persona, carefully constructed around wealth and status, serves as a critique of how capitalist values encourage the fetishization and commodification of personal identity and success. The illusion of the American Dream is most poignantly expressed through Gatsby's unattainable desire for Daisy and everything she represents—social acceptance and love. Despite his wealth and efforts to assimilate into the upper class, Gatsby remains an outsider, emphasizing the unattainability of the American Dream for the majority. His tragic end serves as a stark commentary on the destructive nature of chasing a dream rooted in materialistic and classist values. The film's characters and dialogues bring to life these themes, offering a critique of the capitalist society that Fitzgerald dissects in his original text. Through the 2013 adaptation, contemporary audiences are invited to reflect on the enduring nature of these conflicts and the ways in which economic disparities and capitalist ideologies continue to shape human relationships and societal values. In conclusion, the Marxist analysis of The Great Gatsby (2013) reveals it as a narrative deeply ingrained with critiques of class conflict, commodification, and the elusiveness of the American Dream. Baz Luhrmann's adaptation not only pays homage to Fitzgerald's masterpiece but also underscores its continued relevance in the face of modern society's ongoing struggles with economic inequality and the commodification of life."},{"prompt":"make a result and discussion of this analysis based on the introduction and method below.

The Introduction and Method: A Marxist Theory Analysis of The Great Gatsby (2013) on Class Conflict and the Illusion of the American Dream INTRODUCTION The 2013 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, has reignited interest in the classic American narrative of wealth, love, and disillusionment. While much scholarly attention has been focused on the novel and various film interpretations through literary and cinematic lenses, this study seeks to explore the film through a novel vantage point: a Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the illusion of the American Dream. This approach not only offers a fresh perspective on the material but also aligns with contemporary discourses on economic inequality and cultural hegemony, making the study profoundly relevant to current socio-political discussions. Fitzgerald’s magnum opus continues to captivate because it transcends time in its examination of desire for social recognition, the corrupting power of money, and the elusive nature of the American Dream—themes universally relevant across epochs. Luhrmann’s rendition has sparked fresh debate regarding the timelessness of these themes, underscoring the novel’s continuous relevance in contemporary dialogue (Bryden, 2013). Marxist theory, with its focus on class struggle and economic determinants of social life, provides a robust framework for analyzing narratives centered on wealth disparities and social ascent, such as “The Great Gatsby.” The novel and its cinematic adaptations have been extensively analyzed for their thematic richness and historical context (Bryden, 2013). However, less explored is how the visual and narrative strategies of Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation highlight or dilute the class conflicts and critiques of capitalism inherent in Fitzgerald’s text. With rising global economic disparities, this analysis is not merely historical or academic but also urgently contemporary. The Hook of Each Element 1. Class Conflict: This study will dissect how the portrayal of interactions between characters from different social classes in “The Great Gatsby” (2013) serves as a narrative mechanism for critiquing class divisions and the capitalist system that sustains them, offering insights into the enduring nature of these conflicts in American society. 2. Commodification of Life: An exploration of how the film depicts the transformation of relationships, emotions, and human values into commodities, reflecting Marxist theories of commodification and fetishism of commodities, will shed light on contemporary consumer culture and its impacts on human connections. 3. The Illusion of the American Dream: By analyzing how the film portrays the American Dream and its unattainability for the majority, this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion about the myth of meritocracy and the reality of socioeconomic mobility in capitalist societies. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding how film adaptations can reconstruct, reinterpret, or reinforce the socio-economic critiques present in their source materials. Through a Marxist and Neo-Marxist lens, this research aims to unravel how Luhrmann’s adaptation communicates messages about class, capitalism, and the American Dream to a 21st-century audience, potentially reflecting and critiquing current economic and social realities. Moreover, by focusing on the 2013 adaptation’s unique cinematic elements, this study expands the discourse on how visual media can serve as a powerful tool for socio-political commentary. METHODOLOGY Using a thorough methodology, this paper analyses the 2013 film adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” from a Marxist and Neo-Marxist perspective, emphasising themes of commodification, class conflict, and the false promise of the American Dream. The analysis incorporates a thorough critical examination of the movie, exploring socioeconomic topics through scenes, dialogues, and visual components. Notably, the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation serves as the main source of information. Secondary sources include academic studies and criticisms of Marxist and Neo-Marxist philosophy, the original novel, and earlier examinations of the socio-economic elements of the story. Data gathering includes numerous viewings of the film to catalogue cases exhibiting major themes, as well as a thorough literature assessment to build the study’s theoretical framework and a thematic coding method to organise selected examples into main study topics. The analysis phase employs Marxist and Neo-Marxist theories to decipher thematic codes, which critically assesses how the film reflects, challenges, or reinforces capitalist ideas. This methodical methodology reveals deeper meanings and societal critiques, with a result of synthesis of data that define how the film coincides with or diverges from standard readings, contributing to the debate over “The Great Gatsby’s” ongoing socioeconomic relevance.

IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK’S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...! NICK (V.O.) The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper. FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street. NICK (V.O.) Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious. PUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up. NICK (V.O.)

At Yale, I’d dreamed of being a writer. He resists the temptation to swap bonds books for literature. NICK (V.O.) But I gave all that up. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - DAY Nick emerges onto the porch, greeted by dazzling sunshine. NICK (V.O.) With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees, I planned to spend the summer studying. Nick sits and places his bonds book in front of him... NICK (V.O.) And I probably would have-- When woman’s shriek startles him... NICK’S POV: On the neighboring beach a group of revellers are frolicking. A scantily girl clad waves and then disappears into the trees, drawing Nick’s eye to his neighbor’s house... NICK (V.O.) Were it not for the riotous amusements that beckoned from beyond the walls of that colossal castle...

BUCHANAN MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON An impressive Georgian mansion overlooks a quarter mile of lawn that cascades down to a private polo field. NICK (V.O.) In old money East Egg. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen. FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house. NICK (V.O.) Her husband was heir to one of America’s wealthiest families. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom whacks the polo ball... NICK (V.O.) His name was Tom Buchanan. The ball nearly hits one of Tom’s gardeners... NICK (V.O.) When we were at Yale together he’d been a sporting star. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch... NICK (V.O.) But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs. Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty. TOM (INTO PHONE) I thought I told you not to call me here...! PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength. TOM (CONT’D) Shakespeare! How’s the great American novel coming...? NICK Oh, I’m selling bonds now Tom... with Walter Chase’s outfit-- TOM Never heard of em. Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness! TOM (CONT’D) Hey! What say after dinner we go into town? Can’t-- NICK TOM Catch up with the old wolf pack? NICK Big day on the new job tomorrow-- TOM Nonsense! We’re going. INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON Tom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that chronicle Tom’s infinite sporting achievements. TOM First team, all-American! Tom admires his own achievements. TOM (CONT’D) You see? Made me who I am today. Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet-- TOM (CONT’D) Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy! Tom exchanges the trophy for a football. TOM (CONT’D) Life’s something you dominate Nick. He pelts Nick with the ball-- TOM (CONT’D) If you’re any good. Nick fumbles as Tom charges him-- TOM (CONT’D) Ha-ha-ha! Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into... INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. We hear the giggle of naughty children... BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice... DAISY (O.S.) Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely? Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating... NICK (V.O.) Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see... She whispers dramatically... DAISY Do they miss me in Chicago? NICK Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love. DAISY (unimpressed) How gorgeous. NICK They’re absolutely in mourning... They’re crying... DAISY No-- NICK They’re wailing... DAISY No-- NICK They’re screaming, they’re shouting... DAISY No-- NICK “Daisy Buchanan, we can’t live without you!” DAISY I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...! Daisy takes Nick’s hand and squeals with childish glee as she drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor. He stares up... And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back. This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER. DAISY (CONT’D) Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer. CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face... NICK (V.O.) She was the most frightening person I’d ever seen-- Nick rights himself and extends his hand. NICK I’ve seen your face on the cover of “Sporting Life”. Nick Carraway... But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look). NICK (V.O.) But I enjoyed looking at her. JORDAN I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember... Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight. DAISY I know! This summer I'll sort of, fling you and Jordan together... As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal. DAISY (CONT’D) I’ll push you into linen closets, and out to sea in boats... JORDAN I’m not listening to a word! Irritated, Tom turns to Nick. TOM Nick, Daisy tells me you’re over at West Egg; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) throwing your lot in with those social-climbing, primitive New Money types...? NICK Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month. DAISY Your life is adorable. Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt. JORDAN I know somebody in West Egg. NICK I don't know a single-- Jordan turns dramatically. JORDAN Oh, you must know Gatsby. Daisy, a sharp intake of breath. DAISY Gatsby? CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion. DAISY (CONT’D) What Gatsby...? Before anyone can reply, Henri announces-- HENRI Madame, le diner est servi! As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains flutter up again. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom sit at a long, sumptuously laid table. Food, wine, laughter, smoking... DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY: Through fragments of conversation... DAISY Would you like to hear a family secret? Its about the butler’s nose... JORDAN Things went from bad to worse... DAISY Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west... NICK Its a libel, I’m too poor. JORDAN They have to be old so they die quickly... NICK Can’t we talk about something else? Anything? Crops? You’re making me feel uncivilized Daisy-- This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom. TOM Civilization's going to pieces! Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard? NICK Why no... Tom stands and begins to pace-- TOM Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races... Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant-- TOM (CONT’D) Will have control of things. DAISY (wickedly) Tom’s been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in them TOM It’s been proved. Its scientific. DAISY (subtly mocking Tom) We’ve got to beat them down. SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG! TOM Excuse me... I’ll be right back. He goes inside. An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down. DAISY I’m sorry... She follows Tom into the house. Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan. NICK Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor... JORDAN Shhhh... Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens. A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. NICK Is something happening? JORDAN I thought everybody knew. NICK I don’t. JORDAN Tom's got some woman in New York. NICK Got some woman? JORDAN She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don’t you think? Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table. DAISY (a tense gayety) I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn’t he? NICK I’m not even faintly like a rose-- TOM So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club. DAISY Nicky, stay-- NICK I have to work early. TOM Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two. Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek. NICK (V.O.) None of us could ignore that fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: DAISY Oh Nicky... NICK What? DAISY Its just, well, you see, I think everything’s terrible anyhow. You know I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I’ve had very bad time Nicky... I’m pretty cyncical about everything. Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. Nick tries to change the subject-- NICK Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything? DAISY Pammy? Oh yes... Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk. DAISY (CONT’D) Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... DAISY (CONT’D) All the bright precious things fade so fast... And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle... DAISY (CONT’D) And they don’t come back. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby’s dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay. NICK (V.O.) When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor’s dock. Nick goes closer, and watches The Man... NICK (V.O.) And something told me it was... Mr. Gatsby. The Man reaches out-- NICK (V.O.) He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark. A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, troubled... NICK The green light. DOCTOR Green light? Nick struggles with a painful memory... NICK I don’t want to talk about this Doctor. Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits: NICK (CONT’D) I can’t talk about THIS. DOCTOR (delicately) Then write about it. NICK (skeptical) Write? DOCTOR Yes. Write. NICK Why would I do that? DOCTOR After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time. NICK Yeah, well. It didn’t bring anyone else much solace... I wasn’t any good. The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept. DOCTOR No one need ever read it. You can always burn it. NICK What would I write about? DOCTOR Anything. Whatever you can’t quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place... Write it down. CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge... NICK (to himself) A place... Slowly he takes the pen. We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over. NICK (V.O.) The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance. NICK (V.O.) New York’s dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city... IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here. NICK (V.O.) ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland... NICK (V.O.) ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg... NICK’S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: “Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.” NICK (V.O.) ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God. INT. TRAIN - DAY Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the halted carriage. Nick sits opposite. NICK (V.O.) Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club.... As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet. NICK (V.O.) But the day took an unexpected turn... Tom drags Nick from the moving train. TOM Come on--! EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom. NICK (O.S.) What are we doing? TOM Trust me! NICK Wait a second would you!? TOM (calls back) Dominate Nick! Dominate! PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage. A sign reads: “GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.” INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office. TOM Hello Wilson! How's business? WILSON (unconvincing) I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? TOM I've got my man working on it. WILSON Works pretty slow, don't he? TOM (coldly) Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else? WILSON I don't mean that, I just... Wilson’s grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual. MYRTLE If its business you’re talking, you should be talking to me... (to her husband) Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down... Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom. MYRTLE (CONT’D) (without turning) Hurry up! WILSON Oh, sure... Sure... Wilson hurries out back. TOM Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway. MYRTLE A pleasure... TOM Nick’s a writer... Myrtle is completely uninterested. NICK (feeble) I’m in bonds, actually... TOM (intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train. MYRTLE (playing hard to get) Now...? Are we gettin’ that dog? TOM Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She’ll like him... NICK Oh no, that’s alright, I’m busy... MYRTLE Catherine’s said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know. NICK Really I can’t... TOM (whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That’s rude. CUT TO: INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - DAY The muffled sounds of sex... CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand. CATHERINE I’m Catherine; ain’t we havin’ a party? NICK Oh, I’m... I’m not sure now’s a good time-- I was just going-- But Nick’s exit is blocked. MRS. MCKEE Hello...! MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. MR. MCKEE (extending his hand) Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you. NICK Nick Carraway. MRS. MCKEE Where’re the kids? Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... CATHERINE What’s the matter? Don’t ya like me? SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress. MRS. MCKEE Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable! MYRTLE (with impressive hauteur) It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like! Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. TOM Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet. NICK (making for the door) Tom, I really should be going... TOM (grabbing Nick’s arm) Nonsense... NICK Tom; I don’t think-- Daisy’s my-- Tom pulls Nick back toward the party. TOM Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that’s OK, I make no judgment; but we’ve got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball? CATHERINE Yeah. Ain’t we good enough for ya? Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly lands herself in his lap. CATHERINE (CONT’D) Take off yer hat and stay awhile... TOM Hey Nick! McKee’s in the artistic game. MCKEE Photography. TOM Nick’s artistic. NICK No... Really? MCKEE NICK Ah, no, well, I write a little... Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music. CATHERINE Do you live on Long Island, too? NICK I live at West Egg. CATHERINE Really? I was there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him? NICK I live right next door to him... CATHERINE He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. You know, the evil German king... CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle’s skirt suggestively. TOM Hey McKee, take a picture of that! MYRTLE (girlish glee) Oh, don’t! (MORE) MYRTLE (CONT'D) I’m not one of those models...! But you can if you want... Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick’s ear. CATHERINE Neither of them can stand who they're married to. NICK Doesn’t she like Wilson either? MYRTLE (overhears) ...He’s a greasy little scumbag! Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine. CATHERINE No thanks; I feel just as good on nothing at all... With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill... CATHERINE (CONT’D) Nerve pills, I get them from a doctor in Queens. You want one? NICK My nerves are fine thanks... Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down. NICK (V.O.) I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon... DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, nauseatingly violent... As Catherine undresses Nick... NICK (V.O.) That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York. As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet! MYRTLE ...I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave! Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip... MYRTLE (CONT’D) My dear I'm giving you this dress! Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress. MRS. MCKEE Adorable! Adorable! SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom window, observing the infinite life of the city... NICK (V.O.) High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street... INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, now alone, pen in hand, writes furiously. NICK (V.O.) ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering... EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself upstairs looking out from Myrtle’s window. NICK (V.O.) I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life... POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity... INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling! TOM You’ve got no right to speak her name! Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed... MYRTLE Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it whenever I want! Daisy! Dai-- SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle’s nose! CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY Nick’s been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... NICK I have no clue how I got home. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. He realizes he’s been sleeping on the porch in his underwear. NICK (V.O.) But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling... His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... NICK (V.O.) ....that Gatsby was watching me. INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY The Doctor leans forward. DOCTOR (slightly incredulous) Watching you...? NICK Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... DOCTOR And how do you know that? NICK Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick’s doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... NICK(CONT’D) No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby’s... The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: “Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TWILIGHT A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby’s gates. NICK (V.O.) You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited... As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby’s gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... NICK (V.O.) The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby’s... CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby’s magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs. NICK (V.O.) And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby’s door... A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...! INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby’s... NICK (V.O) A caravansary of... IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over... NICK (V.O.) Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby’s beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors... (MORE) NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven! Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... NICK (to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? He brandishes his invitation. NICK (CONT’D) I live just next door... BARTENDER Mr. Gatsby? I’ve never seen him sir. Why, no one has... The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini. NICK (V.O.) Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk. He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party... NICK Wow. As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind... VOICE I thought I might see you here... Startled, Nick turns to find... Jordan Baker. NICK Hello. JORDAN I remembered you lived next door... NICK Its like... an amusement park. JORDAN Shall we? Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps... NICK Did you get an invitation? JORDAN People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s. NICK Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby? A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects... TEDDY He was a German spy during the war. JORDAN Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway. NICK (to Teddy) A German spy...? Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in... NELSON No, no, no, no. He’s the Kaiser’s assassin. And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds... LANGUID GIRL I heard he killed a man once. NELSON Its true! LANUID GIRL You look at him sometimes when he thinks no one’s watching... I’ll bet he killed a man. TEDDY Kills for fun! Free of charge. NELSON Well he’s already richer than God. Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper. NICK You don’t believe he killed a man do you...? JORDAN (wickedly) Let’s go find him, and you can ask him yourself... As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey is announced, Jordan leads Nick off... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively... JORDAN Oh, Mr. Gatsby...! (to Nick) Shall I lead you into his clutches? INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity. OWL EYES You won’t find him...! He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan. OWL EYES (CONT’D) This house and everything in it, are all part of an elaborate disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn’t exist. JORDAN Phooey; I’ve met him! OWL EYES Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I’ve been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now - but no matter where I look, I can’t find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby. JORDAN (blithely dismissive) Well I don’t care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they’re so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy. NICK (slowly to Owl Eyes) But if that’s true; what’s all this for...? OWL EYES That, my dear fellow, is the question... Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his gaze to... Gatsby’s garden, where, as the band hits fever pitch, and twilight becomes night... THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!! EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening’s many fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!! On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks! NICK I didn’t expect all this... JORDAN (coy) What did you expect? NICK I don’t know... JORDAN Disappointed? NICK Not in the slightest... Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss... TEDDY (to Nick) Penny-less pantywaist! Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away... TEDDY (CONT’D) I’m stealing her away Carraway! Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... ORCHESTRA LEADER Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's “A Jazz History of the World”, and accompanying fireworks! Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off-- TEDDY Look around you! Rich girls don’t marry poor boys-- On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... MAN Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? NICK Yes; The Ninth Battalion. CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty. MAN I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport? NICK (very tipsy) The whole thing’s incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now crumpled invitation) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven’t met Mr. Gatsby, no one’s met him; they say he’s third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil! At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick... MAN I’m afraid I’m not a very good host, old sport... I’m Gatsby. CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops. NICK (muttering apologies) Oh.. I’m very sorry-- I... I’ve had so much to drink... The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky! GATSBY (apologetically) I thought you knew, old sport. Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum. NICK (V.O.) His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in. All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby. HERZOG Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire. Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick. GATSBY I’m trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? Nick shakes himself from his reverie. NICK What time? GATSBY Any time that suits you. Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan. GATSBY (CONT’D) Lovely to see you Miss Baker. He kisses her lightly on the hand. GATSBY (CONT’D) (to Nick) If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me. As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement. NICK I expected him to be... JORDAN Old and fat? NICK Well, yes; young men don’t just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island. JORDAN He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... NICK Why not? JORDAN I don’t know... I just don’t believe he went there... Jordan is interrupted by a voice. HERZOG I beg your pardon... She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them. HERZOG (CONT’D) Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone. JORDAN (surprised) Me? HERZOG Yes, madame. As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... Nick, unsettled, watches her go... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... Seeing Nick, she rushes to him... JORDAN Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense... Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan. TEDDY Where have you been!? The car’s waiting! Jordan is dragged out the door... Nick, on tenterhooks follows, as Jordan calls back... JORDAN Simply amazing! It all makes sense. It all makes sense... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles. Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs. NICK What makes sense...? JORDAN Everything... But here I am tantalizing you... The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, a mysterious smile as she leans out the window. JORDAN (CONT’D) And I swore I wouldn’t tell. But... NICK JORDAN Nick. I’m sorry, I swore I wouldn’t tell. The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... A voice startles him. GATSBY Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning. Herzog appears behind Gatsby. HERZOG Philadelphia on the phone, sir. Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile. GATSBY Good night, old sport... NICK Good night. Thank you. Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch. SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly... OWL EYES Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!? The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention. Jordan, leaning out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him. JORDAN Come and see me... We’ll have tea! I’m in the phone-book! Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his yard from Gatsby’s, he stops; a familiar feeling... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he raises his hand in formal farewell. NICK (V.O) We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MORNING Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of orange juice begins to rattle and shake. Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Gatsby’s yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick’s drive and skids to a stop. Nick emerges to his porch. Gatsby leaps out! GATSBY Its pretty isn’t it, old sport...? Haven’t you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We’re having lunch! SLAM CUT TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity. GATSBY Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow? NICK My... opinion? GATSBY Yes, yes, your opinion! Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life! GATSBY (CONT’D) I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You’ve heard the stories...? NICK Well-- GATSBY I’ll tell you God’s truth. God’s truth about myself! (raises right hand) I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it’s a... a family tradition. As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick’s V.O. fades up. NICK (V.O.) The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying... GATSBY After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe! NICK Europe? Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands... GATSBY Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago... PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY Gatsby hasn’t stopped for breath... GATSBY Then came the war, old sport... NICK (V.O.) Just when I thought it couldn’t be any more fantastical... GATSBY It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life... NICK (V.O.) He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army! CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion. GATSBY In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... Something catches Nick’s eye... NICK’S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson’s Garage. GATSBY (CONT’D) ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead. SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing! GATSBY (CONT’D) I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick’s lap. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here! That’s the one from Montenegro. It looks authentic. Turn it. GATSBY (CONT’D) NICK (reads) Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary. GATSBY That’s right. SLAP! A photograph joins the medal. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here’s another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand. NICK (V.O.) What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true? DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... GATSBY (O.S.) But don’t take my word for it. At lunch, I’m going to introduce you to one of New York’s most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I’ve told you, and vouch for my good character... I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway. NICK I’m sure that’s not necessary... Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity. GATSBY Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don’t want you to think I’m just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I’m going to make a very big request of you today. NICK A big request? GATSBY Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. NICK (caught off guard) Jordan...? What’s she got to do with it? GATSBY Oh, I assure you it’s nothing underhand. Miss Baker’s an honest sportswoman; she’d never do anything that wasn’t alright... RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside. COP Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb! GATSBY (calmly) All right, old sport! Alright. Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... COP (embarrassed) Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me! The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge! NICK One of your old Oxford pals? GATSBY Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. (adds proudly) I imagine he’ll be at lunch too... NICK By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. An orchestral melody surges... NICK (V.O.) I didn’t know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... As the orchestra builds, Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... NICK (V.O.) Even Gatsby could happen... BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into: INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune! PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO: INT. DICK DIVER’S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop... In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM. WOLFSHEIM Ah my boy...! They embrace. GATSBY Meyer, Meyer... WOLFSHEIM You smell so good. GATSBY Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim. Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop. WOLFSHEIM A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway. I know all about you. NICK Really? WOLD Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always talking about you. Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out... WOLFSHEIM (sinister) Come, join us for a little lunch... INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy... ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings. WOLFSHEIM (whispers to Gatsby) Tell Walter Chase; “he shuts his mouth or he doesn’t get a penny...” GATSBY We’ll talk about that later... The HEAD WAITER appears. HEAD WAITER Highballs, Mr. Gatsby? GATSBY Yes, highballs it is. (points to Nick) You take good care of my friend here! A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth. COMMISSIONER Hey Jay...! You’re under arrest!!! Gatsby smiles and tips his hat. GATSBY You be careful now. You’re turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner. (to Nick) See, that’s the Commissioner back there. Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low... He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table. GATSBY (CONT’D) You be careful at those tables now Senator! SENATOR GULICK Of course! I’ll put a bet on for you Jay! Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on the stage. Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile. GATSBY Shall we order? (to the waiter) Lobster tails all round. (to Nick) They decorate it with truffle slices and fine herbs. Very artistic. Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick... WOLFSHEIM So... How is the bond business Mr. Carraway? NICK It’s fine, thank you. WOLFSHEIM I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion-- GATSBY No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about. WOLFSHEIM Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man. Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up. GATSBY Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. (gesturing to Nick) Meyer, do you mind? Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone. WOLFSHEIM Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby’s acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such... medals. And, an Oggsford man. Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford? NICK I've heard of it... WOLFSHEIM Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife... NICK I’m not... married. WOLFSHEIM But you work on Wall Street, right? NICK (totally confused) Yes... Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit. WOLFSHEIM Looking at my tiepin? CLOSE ON: The pin. WOLFSHEIM (CONT’D) Finest specimen of human molars... Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns. GATSBY Gentlemen. Everything alright...? NICK Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people’s wives... GATSBY (taking his seat) Other people’s wives? Ah... I see. Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim. GATSBY (CONT’D) Other people’s wives... Meyer? Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... WOLFSHEIM Well, my work here is done. I’ll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women... Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... GATSBY You’ll have to excuse him... In his old age, he’s prone to “digress...” He’s a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... NICK Who is he anyhow? GATSBY Meyer? He’s a gambler. Over Nick and Gatsby’s shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... NICK An actor? GATSBY Meyer? No. He’s the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. NICK Fixed it? Fixed it. GATSBY NICK How did he manage that? GATSBY He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He’s a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table. TOM Hey Nick! Nick! Where’ve you been!? Daisy’s furious you haven’t called up. Nick and Gatsby stand. NICK This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. GATSBY I’m so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. Tom turns back to Nick. TOM I wouldn’t have expected to find you in this temple of virtue. NICK I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... CUT TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts. DISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... NICK I’m looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I’ve spotted her. Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan. NICK (CONT’D) What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? An immaculate MAITRE’D offers Nick a chair. MAITRE’D Will the gentleman be joining? NICK (frustrated) One moment please-- JORDAN Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant. As Nick’s frustration and Jordan’s embarrassment grow-- NICK It’s all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he’s going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is-- JORDAN If you’ll just have a seat-- NICK What is this big request!? JORDAN Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea. NICK Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? Nick sits... Why? NICK (CONT’D) JORDAN Well... I don’t know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY TIGHT ON: Golf shoes biting into soft, green grass. JORDAN (O.S.) It was the day I got my new English golf shoes. WIDE: A row of fancy Louisville homes - red, white and blue bunting “tut, tutting” in the breeze - are set along a beautiful, green stretch of park. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) Daisy was by far the most popular girl with the Officers from Camp Taylor... Across the road, 18 YEAR OLD DAISY is perched in the front seat of her flashy white roadster, beaming, happy... JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) One of them was in the car with her. Beside Daisy REVEAL: A handsome lieutenant: YOUNG JAY GATSBY. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) It was Gatsby. And the way he looked at her... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK The silhouettes of Jordan and Nick, leaned close, are lit magnificently against the beaded lights of the city... JORDAN (O.S.) Is the way all girls want to be looked at. Their eyes meet; a conspiring flicker. NICK (blown away) So what happened? JORDAN Well, I don’t know... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FRENCH BATTLEFIELD - DAY Gatsby leads his men on a heroic charge out of the trenches-- JORDAN (O.S.) Gatsby was sent off to war... A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the battlefield! JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) But when the war ended... For some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn’t return... DISSOLVE TO: MONTAGE. A NEWSPAPER FILLS THE SCREEN: “AMERICA’S WEALTHIEST BACHELOR TO WED: TOM BUCHANAN LURES LOUISVILLE’S SWEETHEART.” JORDAN (O.S.) A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago swept in and stole her away... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - NIGHT An exquisite string of pearls coils around Daisy’s neck. JORDAN (O.S.) He gave her a string of pearls worth 350,000. REVEAL: Tom, tightening the clasp. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL. DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - MORNING JORDAN (O.S.) But, the morning of the wedding, Daisy received a letter... On the bed, Daisy, hysterical, clutches a bottle in one hand and a letter in the other. DAISY (screams) Tell them Daisy’s changed her mind! JORDAN Daisy! Please, everyone’s waiting! Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck... YOUNG DAISY Give them back!! Suddenly! Daisy tears the pearls and hurls them; they explode into a hundred shimmering pieces against the hard wood floor! CUT TO: A set of stern, white heels clicking down the hall... REVEAL: Daisy’s hard-mouthed MOTHER. DAISY’S MOTHER What on earth is going on in here!? her mother’s eyes land on the bottle, and then the letter... PUSH IN: The last line of the letter reads: Love, Jay. DAISY Leave me alone! DAISY’S MOTHER Jordan, run the bath! Now! DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - BATHROOM - MORNING In the bath, Daisy’s grips the letter in her trembling hands. NICK (O.S.) What was in the letter? A deep breath, a last look, and then, Daisy opens her hand... The letter comes to pieces like snow. JORDAN (O.S.) I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me. But before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: “The truth is...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos. JORDAN (O.S.) Anyways, that day, at five o’clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs. JORDAN After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... (MORE) JORDAN (CONT'D) I’d never seen a girl so in love with her husband. (muses cynically) A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he’s struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought. NICK It’s a strange coincidence, isn’t it? Gatsby’s house being just across the bay... Jordan whirls round-- JORDAN It’s no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she’d wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her. Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time. NICK All that for a girl he hasn’t seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? (to himself) The modesty of it. JORDAN Kind of takes your breath away, doesn’t it? A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS Jordan slides in... TAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to? JORDAN Long Island, please. NICK And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby? JORDAN (a stern whisper) She’s absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can “happen to drop by.” CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... NICK (V.O.) I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew? As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick’s taxi pulls past Gatsby’s mansion, ablaze with light. NICK (V.O.) When I returned home, Gatsby’s was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn’t a sound. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT As Nick’s taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick. NICK Your place looks like the World’s Fair... or Coney Island! GATSBY (terribly anxious) Ah, does it? I’ve... I’ve just been glancing into some rooms... Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-- NICK It’s too late tonight. GATSBY Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer... NICK I must go to bed... Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea. GATSBY Oh, that’s alright. I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK What day would suit you? GATSBY What day would suit you...? I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK Day after tomorrow alright? GATSBY Day after tomorrow? Well, I’d... I’d want to get the grass cut. They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick’s ragged lawn ends and Gatsby’s manicured one begins. GATSBY (CONT’D) There’s another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you? NICK Not really. GATSBY If you’ll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I’m saying right? You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport? NICK Trying to. GATSBY Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. NICK I've got my hands full. Gatsby’s face falls. GATSBY You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you. NICK No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor. Nick’s sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. GATSBY A favor? Yes. NICK As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life... GATSBY Ah, right, right... Goodnight. NICK Goodnight. With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing castle. Nick’s gaze falls upon the unkempt lawn. He smiles. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - DAY TOP SHOT: An enormous mower clatters through frame, carving Nick’s unkempt lawn into a fresh, broad, band of green. REVEAL: An army of gardnders giving Nick’s lawn and garden a make-over, fresh paint, new flowers, trimmed hedges... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY Heavy rain now falls. Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases... Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside. On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly. GATSBY One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal... An awkward beat. NICK The grass looks fine. GATSBY Grass? Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing. GATSBY (CONT’D) What Grass? SUDDEN CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence. WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. The silence stretches, and stretches... Finally... GATSBY Have you got everything you need? NICK Perhaps more flowers? GATSBY I think they did a fine job, don’t you? Beautiful. NICK GATSBY You think it’s too much? NICK I think it’s what you want. GATSBY I think so too... She’ll be impressed, won’t she old sport? NICK I am. With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet! GATSBY I can’t wait all day. I’m leaving! NICK Don’t be silly. It’s just two minutes to four... But Gatsby heads for the door... GATSBY Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late! BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy’s Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic. NICK It’s her. PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Daisy’s chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive. As Nick assists Daisy from the car... DAISY Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? She looks at him with a mysterious smile. DAISY (CONT’D) Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me? NICK That’s the secret of Carraway Castle. (playing along) Tell your chauffeur to go far away. DAISY Come back in an hour, Ferdie! (grave murmur) His name is Ferdie. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY Daisy continues ahead into the living room. Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy’s reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... DAISY (O.S.) Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can’t believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse? INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAISY (to herself) He is in love with me... Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy’s merely been admiring the flower display... NICK That’s funny. DAISY What’s funny? KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door. NICK One moment... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS Nick opens the door. Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick. NICK What are you doing? Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy’s, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur. DAISY I’m certainly glad to see you again. Gatsby’s face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. Finally, he finds words... GATSBY I’m... certainly glad to see you as well. Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the tension-- CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur. GATSBY We've met before... SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby’s elbow... And falls! And breaks! GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah... sorry... He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again! NICK (idiotically) It's an old... clock. DAISY (desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. Gatsby takes a seat. A long silent beat. DAISY (CONT’D) We haven't met for many years. GATSBY (an automatic reflex) Five years next November. The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. NICK (abruptly) Tea? GATSBY (dying) Thank you old sport. DAISY (also mortified) Darling thank you. Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. A long, terrible silence... Suddenly Nick stands. NICK I just need to... pop into town. GATSBY (horrified) Town...? NICK The village; I'll be right back. As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows. GATSBY I've got to speak to you...! INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Wildly following Nick, Gatsby whispers miserably: GATSBY Oh, God! This is a mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake... NICK You're just embarrassed, that's all... Daisy's embarrassed too. GATSBY She's embarrassed? NICK Just as much as you are. GATSBY Don't talk so loud! NICK You're acting like a little boy! You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and... Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain. NICK (V.O.) Looking over my story so far, I’m reminded that for the second time that summer... WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone. NICK (V.O.) I was guarding other people’s secrets. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked. NICK (V.O.) Once again I was within... He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy’s attention, to no avail... The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other. NICK (V.O.) And without... Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing. He clears his throat: NICK Its... stopped raining. Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows. GATSBY Yes, it has... (to Daisy) Hasn’t it? He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) What do you think of that, Daisy? Come look. Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - CONTINUOUS DAISY Look. Its my house. Just there across the bay... Gatsby and Daisy’s eyes meet. GATSBY I know. I have the same view from my place. DAISY Where’s your place? Gatsby turns back to Nick. GATSBY Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I’d like to show her around. NICK Are you sure you want me to come? GATSBY Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - DAY Servants swing open ivy-covered gates... GATSBY (proudly) I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy. REVEAL: Gatsby’s castle glistening in the sunlight. CLOSE ON: Daisy. A delighted cry. DAISY Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand! GATSBY Do you like it? DAISY I love it...! But how do you live here all alone? GATSBY I don’t. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people... As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick. GATSBY (CONT’D) My house looks well doesn’t it? See how the whole front catches the light like that? Daisy yells back... DAUSY Come on you two! I want the royal tour! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDENS - DAY Gatsby has transformed into a good-natured show-off, hurrying Nick and Daisy through a maze of fantastical gardens, past magnificent fountains and into his castle... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY Gatbsy shows off his brand new orange-juicer. GATBSY You must understand, I like all things that are modern. Daisy readies a cocktail shaker beneath the spout of the giant silver orange juice machine. GATSBY If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there... The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour...! Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S BEACH - DIVING PONTOON - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy, Nick and Gatsby drunkenly drive golf balls out toward the bay. Nick films on the world’s first home-camcorder... GATSBY Its a remarkable little camera-- latest design. While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne... DAISY You do know, I’m a champion golfer, don’t you? Here, I’ll show you how its done. CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two! She falls into Gatsby arms... Nick films... GATSBY She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don’t you think...? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING Gatsby and Nick trail behind Daisy, crossing the ballroom. Daisy, champagne in hand, spots the soaring ballroom organ. DAISY Oh...! Its beautiful. GATSBY Its a custom Wurlitzer. DAISY Can anyone play it? GATSBY Klipspringer can. (to his footmen) Someone wake Ewing! Daisy twirls round, overjoyed... DAISY Music! And we can dance all night! GATSBY Ewing’s a symphonic genius, he can play anything...! Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down... DAISY Then I demand a Charleston! Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick... GATSBY (as if in a dream) She makes it look so splendid, don’t you think old sport? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE. GATSBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING Nick and Daisy follow Gatsby into the bedroom... Gatsby bounds ahead, starting up a spiral stair... He throws open a massive cabinet, revealing a prism of suits, dressing- gowns, watches and ties. GATSBY I've got a man in England who buys me clothes...! He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat... GATSBY (CONT’D) Something for the lady... Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the rail to Daisy... DAISY I’ve never seen anything like it! GATSBY He sends over a selection at the beginning of each season... DAISY Jay! With ever-increasing enthusiasm! GATSBY These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton! Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched... DAISY No, Jay... you’ll ruin them! (to Nick) Nicky! He’s a madman! More and more and more shirts float down... The rumble of distant thunder. CLOSE ON: Daisy. TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter, like giant snowflakes, down toward her. Slowly, quietly, her mirth transforms to sobs... She hides her face in shirts... Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy, taking her tear-streaked face in his hands... GATSBY What is it? DAISY It’s just... It makes me sad, because... Daisy glances in Nick’s direction... GATSBY Why? DAISY ...because... A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart. NICK (V.O.) Five lost years struggled on Daisy’s lips. But all she could manage was... DAISY It’s just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before. GATSBY If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light... DAISY What green light? GATSBY The one that burns all night at the end of your dock. As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay... NICK (V.O.) Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume... NICK Who's this? Your father? GATSBY No, no.. That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby... DAISY (teases) You never told me you had a pompadour... or a yacht. Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk... GATSBY I want to show you something... Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you. They admire a scrapbook together. DAISY (touched) You saved my letters... GATSBY This was my first photo of you. As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER: DAISY (V.O.) We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing. Come home, I’ll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true... Come home Jay... BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills. GATSBY Excuse me. Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away... He lowers his voice. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) Well I can't talk now old sport... As the timbre of Gatsby’s voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) I said a small town. ECU: Gatsby’s eyes narrow. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) He must know what a small town is. BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows! As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby... GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) (frightening) Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town... Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick’s eye - a tense moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile. We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ... GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! Shall we? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston with Nick. An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, looking on, flush with joy. Slowly though, Gatsby’s expression turns introspective. As he watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him... DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK. AN ARRAY OF MEMORIES AND IMAGES DISSOLVE ONE INTO THE OTHER: Gatsby and Daisy, five years ago, about to kiss; a hand- written letter; a gathering storm; the green light... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT Hundreds of candles flicker in patterns. As a slow, melancholic waltz plays, Gatsby and Daisy dance, enraptured... DAISY (whispers) I wish I had done everything on earth with you. All my life. Gatsby holds her closer. DAISY (CONT’D) I wish that it could always be like this... GATSBY It will be... Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own... NICK (V.O.) If only it had been enough for Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy... The towering doors close. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Gatsby stands at his window, staring into the night. NICK (V.O.) But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy’s part in it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick is writing at his desk... NICK (V.O.) It wasn’t until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy... INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick stops his reading, and, very slowly, admits... NICK You see doctor... Gatsby’s real name was... James Gatz. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. NORTH DAKOTA FARM HUT - DAY PUSH TOWARD: A dilapidated hut, shrouded in a storm of dust. NICK (V.O.) His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota... DISCOVER: YOUNG GATZ, barefoot, at a dusty desk, surrounded by tattered books, strange charts, and lists. He is practicing his signature... NICK (V.O.) But he never accepted them as his parents at all. Young Gatz turns from his writing, and looks through a hole in the roof towards the infinite heavens... NICK (V.O.) In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God... CLOSE ON: The little boy looks up at CAMERA. NICK (V.O.) Destined for future glory... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - PRAIRIE - NIGHT The silhouette of TEENAGE GATZ, now 16 years old, disappears into the hills... NICK (V.O.) Chasing this destiny, a sixteen year old Gatz ran far, far away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAKE SUPERIOR - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON: A handsome 17 year old YOUNG GATSBY, in a torn jersey and dirty canvas pants, rowing with all his might. NICK (V.O.) One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril... Young Gatsby lets the row boat drift close to a magnificent yacht. Wind is whipping whitecaps on the bay. NICK He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... The bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht’s railing. CODY Whadzamatta...? Cody is very drunk. Young Gatsby calls urgently. YOUNG GATSBY Sir! The shoal here’s real bad, this wind could drag you onto it... Cody waves a dismissive arm... CODY Whaderathinkyerdoin..., old sport? He collapses, dead drunk. PUSH IN: On Young Gatsby; a plan forming... NICK (V.O.) This was his opportunity, and he seized it. Springing into action, he clambers onto the yacht. GATSBY (VOICE) I decided right then and there to call myself: Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - LATE AFTERNOON Young Gatsby hoists the sail as the storm rages around him. NICK (V.O.) He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY A perfect sunny day. Young Gatsby and Cody are sailing. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world... GATSBY (VOICE) He was alright, old Dan, he taught me everything... DISSOLVE TO: INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY Young Gatsby, now transformed, models a suit in the mirror. NICK (V.O.) How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman... He looks squarely at himself, and repeats a mantra. YOUNG GATSBY Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY Young Gatsby stands at the bow, as the yacht cut across the clear blue ocean... He turns to Cody and calls... YOUNG GATSBY She looks well, doesn’t she...!? Old sport. HIGH AND WIDE: The yacht sails toward the golden sun... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody’s fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody’s family... He’d been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor. NEWSPAPER MONTAGE. SLAM CUT TO: Piles and piles of New York City newspapers swirl rapidly TOWARD CAMERA, and we read their headlines: “GATBSY’S STAGGERING WEALTH - MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!” NICK (V.O.) By midsummer Gatsby was front page news... “GATSBY BUYING OUR CITY? INVESTMENT MONOPOLY FUELS CONCERNS” “JAY CASHES IN! GATSBY STRIKES WALL STREET GOLD!” “GATSBY INVESTS IN SKYSCRAPERS!” “JAY PAYS FOR EVERYTHING: PARTIES, GALAS, PARKS, SCHOOLS!” “WALL STREETS KING? MEET JAY GATSBY!” A final newspaper COVERS FRAME: “WHERE’S THE MONEY FROM!? MYSTERY MILLIONS SPARK WILD RUMORS” We PUSH TOWARD the paper and DISSOLVE TOWARD: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT Another glittering party. NICK (V.O.) Where did the money comes from? FADE IN: Decadent, grotesque images of drunken revellers... NICK (V.O.) That’s what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom’s mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby’s glittering parties... DISCOVER: Gatsby leading Tom, Daisy and Nick to the top of the terrace stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT GATSBY We’ve got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me... He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick... TOM (mutters to Daisy) A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers. DAISY Not Gatsby. He’s a businessman. TOM (snorts) Hah! A businessman... DAISY He owned a lot of drug stores. Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group... GATSBY May I introduce Senator Gulick? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan... DAISY Delighted... GATSBY And Mr. Buchanan... (a moment's hesitation) The polo player. TOM (objecting quickly) Oh no. Not me. SENATOR GULICK (shaking hands, nods) Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan. Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy: TOM I’d rather not be the polo player. DAISY Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements. Gatsby interjects-- GATSBY (to the group) May I show you around? He guides them down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) You must see the faces of a lot of people you’ve heard of. DAISY Absolutely! TOM (scoffs) We don’t go around very much. I don’t think I recognize a single person... GATSBY Perhaps you know that lady there? Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star. DAISY (taking Gatsby’s arm) Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures... As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick... TOM I’d really rather not be the polo player... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT Tom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... DAISY (to Nick) These things excite me so... Gatsby turns to Tom... GATSBY I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. TOM That’s right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop... GATSBY That’s right. See... I know your wife. TOM Is that so? GATSBY Yes. As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity. HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here... Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... GATSBY Not now. Herzog silently recedes... A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... TRIMALCHIO And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot! Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... GATSBY Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye. TOM Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. As Daisy takes Gatsby’s arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom’s breast pocket and murmurs... DAISY In case you need to take down any addresses... As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT As Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly. DAISY Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? GATSBY No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... DAISY It’s perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT Tom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought. TOM I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... TOM (CONT’D) (to Nick) I’ll find you... He leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... Gatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy. Then, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... Gatsby turns, and Daisy’s lips suddenly find his. A long, still kiss... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Nick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree. When Tom suddenly appears... TOM Have you seen my wife...? Startled, Nick turns... NICK (lies) Ah... no... Not for awhile. TOM That’s funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. Tom follows Nick’s gaze down toward the tree... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby and Daisy continue their passionate kissing... After a moment, Daisy whispers. DAISY I... I wish we could just run away. Gatbsy is startled. GATSBY Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn’t be... respectable. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Tom is still looking to the tree. TOM (quizzically) You live near here Nick...? Nick, an overwhelming sense of guilt, indicates vaguely in the direction of the tree. NICK Just next door. TOM That so...? EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby continues... GATSBY We’re going to live here, in this house, together. You and me... Daisy... It’s time for you to tell Tom. EXT. GATBSY CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Nick, a moment of extreme tension as he fears Tom will investigate further. SUDDENLY! Their attention is drawn to a commotion on the terrace. Glasses smash, a woman screams, and through the crowd, we see Slagle and associates causing a disturbance. TOM (pure disdain) What a circus... Well, if you see her, I’ll be looking for her. You tell her. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT The hidden lovers speak in intense, hushed tones. DAISY Remember how much fun we used to have? Why can’t we just have fun like that again? Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows... Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled... DAISY (CONT’D) Oh hello Nicky; we’re having a row. NICK What about? Daisy glides toward him... DAISY About things... About the future... (trying to be funny) The future of the Colored Empires. NICK Well, its Tom. He’s wandering around the party looking for you. Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs... HERZOG Sir; it’s Mr. Slagle; he’s quite... emotional. A tiny, ruffled, moment; then Gatsby elegantly guides Daisy toward Nick. GATSBY Excuse me. Nick, would you mind? As Gatsby follows Herzog back toward the castle.... CLOSE ON: DAISY. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER Nick and Daisy return to a party that has become grotesque; drunken girls haphazardly bang drums... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby disappeared to deal with a dispute of some sort. Daisy waited... CLOSE ON: Daisy, dejected... NICK But Gatsby was unable to return. As Daisy and Nick cross the tattered, streamer-littered dance- floor CRANE HIGH AND FADE INTO: the library window... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby sits, solemn in an armchair; with quiet unease written in shadows across his face. REVEAL: The ominous silhouette of Wolfsheim, pacing between Gatsby and the window; Herzog standing watch... We catch only a fragment of the conversation. WOLFSHEIM When these hot headed types appear, I rely on you... But you were not available.. A scene was made... What’s going on with you Jay? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATE - NIGHT HIGH SHOT: A sleek black limo winds quietly towards the gate. CRANE DOWN TO DISCOVER: Daisy’s face through the limo window; her forlorn eyes search for Gatsby behind castle walls... TOM Where were you? DAISY With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds. TOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... DAISY’S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. TOM (O.C.) (CONT’D) I’d like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I’ll make a point of finding out. As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby’s “guards.” CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby’s gate, GATSBY’S COAT OF ARMS READS: “Ad Finem Fidelis” (”Faithful to the End”). DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... Nick descends the stairs, drunk. NICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... Gatsby is not amused. GATSBY She didn’t like it. NICK Of course she did. GATSBY No, she didn’t like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It’s hard to make her understand. NICK You mean about the party? GATSBY The party!? I couldn’t care less about the parties! You see... (shocking intensity) (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. What...? NICK GATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents’ house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we’ll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. NICK I wouldn’t ask too much of her... GATSBY Ask too much? NICK No. Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. GATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- NICK Jay... You can’t repeat the past. Gatsby wheels around... GATSBY Can’t repeat the past? NICK No. GATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You’ll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything’s been so... so confused since then... Gatsby looks out to the green light. NICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... GATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. NICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... IN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY’S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... DISSOLVE TO: I/E. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT PUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping... NICK (V.O.) Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy’s house by colossal accident. Amidst the many revellers, DISCOVER: Daisy, hurrying through the crowd. GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I’d never been in such a beautiful house before... Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer’s uniform. NICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. Daisy’s Mother stops her on the steps. DAISY MOM Daisy, don’t scamper. (whispers) There’s so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family’s... CLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. Against his better judgement he follows Daisy up... INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT Checking to make sure no one has seen, Daisy slips quietly through a set of doors, into the conservatory... Gatsby is not far behind... A secret rendezvous. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT GATSBY I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her... INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT Daisy throws herself in to Gatsby’s arms... About to kiss, Gatsby is struck by a sudden instinctive thought... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT Gatsby remembers... GATSBY So I stopped. And I waited... I waited... INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT Gatsby’s eyes drift up... GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I waited for a moment longer. He looks out the dark, crystal windows, beyond the trees... to a staircase of moonlight, climbing up, up, up... NICK (V.O.) He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like... the mind of God... That falling in love would change his destiny... forever. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT GATSBY And then I just let myself go. INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT With sudden resolve Gatsby kisses Daisy... In ravenous embrace, they fall onto the long sofa lounge. NICK (V.O.) She blossomed for him like a flower... ECU: Daisy, her lips tremble, eyes wide, breath quickening.. NICK (V.O.) And the incarnation was complete. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT The other layers of IMAGERY IN THE CLOUDS MELT AWAY, leaving Nick and Gatsby standing by the pool. GATSBY I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I’m only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars. GATSBY (CONT’D) It’s got to keep going up. Gatsby looks to the green light. GATSBY (CONT’D) She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them. GATSBY (CONT’D) Don’t worry old sport, don’t worry. I can protect her here. Good night old sport... Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls... GATSBY (CONT’D) You’re wrong about the past, old sport...! Gatsby’s POV: The green light across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) You’re wrong. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EARLY SPRING - MORNING The first day of spring; out the window, birds chirp. Nick is writing and reading aloud... NICK (READS) There had been music from my neighbor’s all summer. In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars... He struggles for a more poetic phrasing... NICK (CONT’D) Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars... (MORE) NICK (CONT’D) (that’s the one) But after Tom and Daisy visit... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby’s castle cuts a grave silhouette against a stormy sky. NICK (V.O.) There were no more parties... His lights flicker and go out. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby’s lights went out one by one. At the gates flashbulbs flash! Hordes of press have gathered. NICK (V.O.) Daisy visited discreetly. But... As the gates creak open, Daisy’s limo slides up the drive... FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “PARTY PALACE GOES DARK!” NICK (V.O.) The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat. As the reporters crowd the limo, shouting questions... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEFROOM - NIGHT Locked away deep in the castle, Gatsby and Daisy make love. FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “WHO IS THE MYSTERY WOMAN?” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - DUSK At the end of the wharf, Gatsby and Daisy look out across the bay, watching as the sun slides into the horizon, and the green light pulses... CLOSE ON: Daisy. She leans to Gatsby and whispers... DAISY I don’t want to go home. Gatsby hold her tighter. GATSBY Then don’t. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby... GATSBY (O.S.) I’ve been meaning to call you up. I’m sorry, I’ve been... so busy. NICK (O.S.) Is everything alright? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone... GATSBY Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. NICK (O.S.) I hear you fired all your servants? GATSBY Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn’t gossip... until we decided what we’re going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? (clarifies) They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes... GATSBY (CONT’D) What’s the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON Nick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby whispers into the phone... GATSBY (excited) Nick... Daisy’s ready. Shes ready. But there’s just one thing. She’s requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? (an admission) Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON PUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY WIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun... DISSOLVE TO: INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter. TOM You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates... TOM (CONT’D) Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... TOM (CONT’D) The sun is getting colder every year... Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. The tension is excruciating. Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay. TOM (CONT’D) How I’d like to be out on that bay today. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle. GATSBY I’m right across from you. (points) Right there. TOM (unimpressed) So you are. Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy. GATSBY Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. TOM What light? Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy’s... GATSBY You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-- With sudden intensity Daisy stands! DAISY (on the verge of tears) It's so hot... Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard. DAISY (CONT’D) Everything's so confused. She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter. DAISY (CONT’D) What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that... (she snaps it again) ...and for the next thirty years? (turns suddenly) Let’s all go to town! Who wants to go to town? Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock. TOM Town!? Women... They get these notions... Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy’s trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet... GATSBY (whispers) Daisy... DAISY (as if they are alone) You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square... CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening. DAISY (CONT’D) The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts. CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar. NICK (V.O.) She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen... SUDDENLY Tom explodes! TOM Let’s go to town! I’m perfectly willing...! That’s a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately! DAISY Just like that? Can’t anyone at least have a cigarette? TOM We’ve smoked all through lunch. DAISY Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss. TOM It was your great idea Daisy. Why don’t we!? We’ll all go to town! Daisy doesn’t budge. DAISY I’ve changed my mind... (teases) You brute. TOM (a dangerous intensity) You’ve got me all excited, and now you don’t want to go? We’ll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey... It will be fun. DAISY Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... Come on, Jordan. As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby. TOM Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby? Then turns and calls to Henri... TOM (CONT’D) Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel. CUT TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women. BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel. Daisy and Jordan follow. TOM Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I’ll drive everyone else in your circus wagon. GATSBY I don’t think there’s much gas, old sport. Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare. TOM (looks at the gauge) Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we’ll stop at a drug store. I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays... (savagely eyes Gatsby) Isn’t that right, Mr. Gatsby? A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom’s arm. DAISY You take Nick and Jordan, Tom! She slips quickly into the coupé... DAISY (CONT’D) We’ll meet you at the Plaza! I’ll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes... Gatsby’s and Tom’s eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance. Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust. I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick... TOM You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow. JORDAN (condescending) And you found he was an Oxford man? TOM Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake! With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: The Duesenberg tears into the Valley... JORDAN (O.C.) (mocking) We’re almost out of gas Tom... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson’s... Wilson doesn’t budge. He’s staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg. TOM Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let’s have some gas... (gets out) Do I have to do it myself? WILSON I’m sick. I’m all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West. TOM Your wife does...? Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle’s face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... NICK (V.O.) Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control... WILSON I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin’ whether she wants to or not. Tom isn’t listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust! TOM What do I owe you!? WILSON Dollar twenty. The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg. TOM You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/TOM’S COUPÉ - DAY VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... SLAM CUT TO: INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... TOM That’s enough... The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration. DAISY Open another window. NICK There aren't any more. DAISY Then telephone for an axe... TOM Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it. GATSBY Why not let her alone, old sport? TOM That's a great expression of yours, isn't it? GATSBY What is? Tom turns to Gatsby... TOM 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up? DAISY Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly. TOM Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man. GATSBY No, not exactly. TOM Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford. GATSBY Yes - I went there. Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting. TOM Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford! Tom...! Gatsby stands. DAISY GATSBY (slow, intense) I told you I went there. TOM I heard you, but I'd like to know when. GATSBY You’d like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby. GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. Nick can’t help but smile. NICK (V.O.) I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back. DAISY I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... But Tom’s not done yet. TOM Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question. GATSBY Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on. TOM What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow? They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content. DAISY He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control! TOM Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we’ll have intermarriage between black and white! JORDAN We’re all white here, Tom. GATSBY Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me! TOM You must be crazy. GATSBY No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me! JORDAN We should go... GATSBY Daisy and I have nothing to hide... DAISY Jay let’s go, please...! TOM Sit down Daisy! GATSBY (reassuring) Yes, Daisy, please sit down. Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note. TOM What's been going on? I want to hear all about it. GATSBY I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...! Tom turns to Daisy sharply. TOM You've been seeing him for five years? GATSBY Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know... TOM Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. Tom starts to make himself a drink... GATSBY No... TOM She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time... DAISY You’re revolting... Daisy’s voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn... DAISY (CONT’D) Do you know why we left Chicago...? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree. Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy. GATSBY That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever. Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly. DAISY Why, how could I love him, possibly? GATSBY You never loved him. Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing. DAISY I never loved him. GATSBY That’s right... TOM Not at Kapiolani? DAISY No. TOM (a husky tenderness) Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never? DAISY Please don’t. TOM Daisy... Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone. DAISY There, Jay. She trembles as she looks to Gatsby... DAISY (CONT’D) You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past. (begins to sob) I did love him once; but I loved you too. GATSBY (shocked, uncomprehending) You loved me too? TOM (savage) Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget. The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby. GATSBY I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now... DAISY Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true. TOM Of course it wouldn't. Daisy turns to her husband. DAISY As if it mattered to you. TOM Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on. GATSBY You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. TOM Nonsense. DAISY (with visible effort) I am, though. TOM She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby. TOM (CONT’D) Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim’s bunch. Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly. TOM (CONT’D) See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter! GATSBY What about it, old sport? TOM Don’t call me ‘old sport!’ This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now. GATSBY Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t too proud to come in on it. TOM I’ve been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim? GATSBY It’s called ‘greed,’ old sport. TOM That’s right; you’ve got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... (to Nick) I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to drag you in... Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. TOM (CONT’D) My God, he has... GATSBY He’s got nothing to do with-- TOM With your little racket... (to Daisy) Daisy... Can’t you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he’s just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...! GATSBY (a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that’s it, and now I’ve just as much as you; so that means we’re equal!! Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn. TOM Oh no, no, we’re different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and Jordan) They are... (now at Daisy) She is; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) we’re all different from you - we were born different, it’s in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage. GATSBY SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... NICK (V.O) Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had “killed a man.” Tom snorts a dismissive laugh. TOM That’s right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears. DAISY My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists. GATSBY Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don’t listen to him Daisy. Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently. GATSBY (CONT’D) We’re going back to Louisville to be married. Then we’re going to live together in our house; it’s-- There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... DAISY Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom. TOM You two start on home... (to Gatsby) In Mr. Gatsby's car. Daisy is alarmed now. TOM (CONT’D) Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her. GATSBY Daisy...! Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel. TOM Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick? What? Want any? NICK TOM NICK No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I’m thirty. Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink... TOM Happy birthday... Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... NICK (V.O.) Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness... NICK’S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge... NICK (V.O.) The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death...

Grabbing his wife’s hair he presses her face to the window. WILSON (CONT’D) You might fool me but you can't fool God! OVER WILSON’S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. WILSON (CONT’D) God sees everything! Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing. The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby’s yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing. CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper. MYRTLE (thinking its Tom) He’s here... WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson’s face as she twists from his grasp! CUT TO: EXT.

TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: The coupe’s blinding headlights. As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion. TOM Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let’s take a look.. JORDAN Must we? TOM Just a look. INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - NIGHT The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe. Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying and wailing a high, horrible call. WILSON O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones. CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... MYRTLE’S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom’s reaction. A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names. POLICEMAN (to Tom) Sir. Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to step away-- TOM Get off me...! (regains his composure) I’m fine. I’m fine. POLICEMAN You knew her? TOM (a long pause) No... Not really... POLICEMAN Well then I have to ask you to step back. TOM What happened...? POLICEMAN She ran out ‘inna road. Son-of-a- bitch didn't even stopus car. A well-dressed African American man steps near. WELL-DRESSED MAN I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car. CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up. MICHAELIS Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job. Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... WILSON You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson. TOM (a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into: INT. WILSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. TOM Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom. POLICEMAN What color's your car? TOM Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York. MICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped... The policeman accepts, suspicious still... POLICEMAN Alright... Blue. In the relative calm of the office, Wilson’s clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom. WILSON Who owns the yella’ car...? TOM (a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he’s a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... WILSON Maybe he was the one foolin’ with Myrtle; maybe that’s why he killed her...? TOM Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... Wilson starts sobbing again. WILSON Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!

BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases. TOM I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... Tom opens the door. NICK No thanks. I'll wait outside. Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain. TOM What is the matter with you? Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick’s arm. JORDAN Won't you come in, Nick? NICK No... thanks. JORDAN It's only half past nine... NICK No. I think I’ve had enough... Of everyone. CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... GATSBY Hello old sport... Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy’s window. His pace quickens. NICK What are you doing!? GATSBY Just sitting here... NICK Yes, I can see that. GATSBY Did you see any trouble out on the road? NICK Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay! GATSBY I thought so... I told Daisy I thoughts so-- NICK Daisy? Do you hear yourself-- GATSBY Its better that the shock should come all at once-- NICK What’s wrong with you!? How could you!? GATSBY Please... Keep your voice down, old sport. NICK Tom was right! You’re nothing but a goddamn coward! GATSBY (threatening) Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping. NICK NO POINT!? GATSBY It, it killed her instantly. I-- NICK Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open! Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain... GATSBY I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel. NICK She? SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... Henri emerges. AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. Finally, Henri goes back in. CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization. NICK (CONT’D) It was Daisy? Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits. GATSBY You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us. CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel... GATSBY (CONT’D) It all happened so quickly. It wasn’t her fault... (MORE) GATSBY (CONT’D) It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel... (intense) No one must know. Promise me. No one. Promise me. NICK Jay-- You shouldn’t be here. You should get out of here. Gatsby gazes back to the house... GATSBY No. No. No. I’m going to wait. I’ll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy’s locked herself in her room, and she’s going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever-- NICK Tom won't touch her. He’s not even thinking about her... GATSBY Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don’t trust him. Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace. NICK Alright. Alright... You wait here. I’ll see if there’s any commotion. GATSBY Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Nick skirts the terrace... Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them.

(beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was... NICK Jay... You oughtta go away. He helps Gatsby cover the car. NICK (CONT’D) Tonight. They’ll trace your car. GATSBY (as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can’t leave now. Not tonight. NICK Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? Nick follows him from the garage toward the house. GATSBY Daisy’s going to call in the morning. Then we’ll make plans, to go away together. NICK But Jay she-- Sensing Nick’s tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty. GATSBY She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She’ll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think. NICK Jay-- GATSBY She just needs to think. She’s going to call in the morning. Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... He turns to go in but stops.

But the truth is... I’m empty. (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) I suppose that’s why I make things up about myself... But I‘ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well-- As Gatbsy continues, Nick’s V.O. FADES UP: NICK (V.O.)

GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock. NICK (V.O.) It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby’s... extraordinary gift for hope. GATSBY ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. NICK (V.O.) A gift that I have never found in any other person... GATSBY I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. NICK (V.O.) And which it is not likely I shall ever find again. GATSBY I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... Finally, Nick is able to ask: NICK What was in the letter? Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... GATSBY The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn’t been able to return-- In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: “Daisy, the truth is... I’m penniless.” GATSBY (O.C.) (CONT’D) I asked her to wait until I’d made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure. The IMAGE of Daisy fades... GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, I felt married to her... That was all. NICK (V.O.) It had all been for her.

GARDENER I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. GATSBY Not today. It’s so beautiful. (to Nick) You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer? Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) Let’s go for a swim. I’ll have the phone transferred to the pool... As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch... NICK Jay, I’ve got to go. I have to work. GATSBY I understand... Well, I’ll walk you out. Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate... NICK I'll call you up. GATSBY Do, old sport, please do. (a thought) I suppose Daisy'll call too. NICK I suppose so... Well... Goodbye. Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls: NICK (CONT’D) They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together!

Coming from a background of poverty, he builds a facade of wealth and status to win back Daisy, whom he views as the ultimate prize. Gatsby's accumulation of wealth through questionable means embodies the capitalist pursuit of success at any cost. His extravagant parties, where \\"the parties were bigger; the shows were broader,\\" serve not only as a display of his newfound wealth but also highlight the commodification of relationships and emotions, where human connections are secondary to the spectacle created by wealth. Gatsby's tragic end underscores the false promise of the American Dream - despite his wealth, he remains an outsider to the old money class and is ultimately discarded when he is no longer of use. **Tom Buchanan:** Representing old money, Tom embodies the rigid class divisions and the sense of entitlement that comes with inherited wealth. His disdain for Gatsby, questioning \\"Who is he, anyhow? An actor?\\" reflects the class prejudice against those who seek to ascend the social ladder. Tom's affair with Myrtle and his manipulative behavior towards Daisy further illustrate the commodification of people, treating them as possessions rather than individuals with autonomy and feelings. **Daisy Buchanan:** Daisy's character is caught between the American Dream as represented by Gatsby and the security of her class status represented by Tom. Her indecisiveness and ultimate choice to remain with Tom highlight the powerful allure of class status and the stability it provides, even at the expense of her happiness. Daisy's role in Gatsby's and Tom's lives further cements her as a commodity, an object of desire whose value is determined by her social standing and the men vying for her attention. **Nick Carraway:** Serving as the observer and narrator, Nick's journey reflects the disillusionment with the American Dream. Initially drawn to the glamour and excitement of Gatsby's world, he becomes increasingly aware of the hollowness and corruption that underlies it. Nick's final realization, \\"They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together!\\" marks his rejection of the values upheld by the characters he once admired. The settings, from Gatsby's lavish mansion to the Valley of Ashes, create a vivid contrast between the opulent lives of the wealthy characters and the stark reality of those left behind in the pursuit of the American Dream. The commodification of life is evident in the relentless pursuit of wealth and status, reducing human relationships to transactions and using people as means to an end. In conclusion, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), through its characters, plot, and setting, presents a critical view of the American Dream and the capitalist society that promotes it. The Marxist analysis highlights the class conflict, commodification of life, and the disillusionment with the American Dream, making the film a pertinent critique of contemporary socio-economic realities."},{"prompt":"make a result and discussion of this analysis based on the introduction and method below.

The Introduction and Method: A Marxist Theory Analysis of The Great Gatsby (2013) on Class Conflict and the Illusion of the American Dream INTRODUCTION The 2013 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, has reignited interest in the classic American narrative of wealth, love, and disillusionment. While much scholarly attention has been focused on the novel and various film interpretations through literary and cinematic lenses, this study seeks to explore the film through a novel vantage point: a Marxist and Neo-Marxist analysis of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the illusion of the American Dream. This approach not only offers a fresh perspective on the material but also aligns with contemporary discourses on economic inequality and cultural hegemony, making the study profoundly relevant to current socio-political discussions. Fitzgerald’s magnum opus continues to captivate because it transcends time in its examination of desire for social recognition, the corrupting power of money, and the elusive nature of the American Dream—themes universally relevant across epochs. Luhrmann’s rendition has sparked fresh debate regarding the timelessness of these themes, underscoring the novel’s continuous relevance in contemporary dialogue (Bryden, 2013). Marxist theory, with its focus on class struggle and economic determinants of social life, provides a robust framework for analyzing narratives centered on wealth disparities and social ascent, such as “The Great Gatsby.” The novel and its cinematic adaptations have been extensively analyzed for their thematic richness and historical context (Bryden, 2013). However, less explored is how the visual and narrative strategies of Luhrmann’s 2013 film adaptation highlight or dilute the class conflicts and critiques of capitalism inherent in Fitzgerald’s text. With rising global economic disparities, this analysis is not merely historical or academic but also urgently contemporary. The Hook of Each Element 1. Class Conflict: This study will dissect how the portrayal of interactions between characters from different social classes in “The Great Gatsby” (2013) serves as a narrative mechanism for critiquing class divisions and the capitalist system that sustains them, offering insights into the enduring nature of these conflicts in American society. 2. Commodification of Life: An exploration of how the film depicts the transformation of relationships, emotions, and human values into commodities, reflecting Marxist theories of commodification and fetishism of commodities, will shed light on contemporary consumer culture and its impacts on human connections. 3. The Illusion of the American Dream: By analyzing how the film portrays the American Dream and its unattainability for the majority, this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion about the myth of meritocracy and the reality of socioeconomic mobility in capitalist societies. The significance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding how film adaptations can reconstruct, reinterpret, or reinforce the socio-economic critiques present in their source materials. Through a Marxist and Neo-Marxist lens, this research aims to unravel how Luhrmann’s adaptation communicates messages about class, capitalism, and the American Dream to a 21st-century audience, potentially reflecting and critiquing current economic and social realities. Moreover, by focusing on the 2013 adaptation’s unique cinematic elements, this study expands the discourse on how visual media can serve as a powerful tool for socio-political commentary. METHODOLOGY Using a thorough methodology, this paper analyses the 2013 film adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” from a Marxist and Neo-Marxist perspective, emphasising themes of commodification, class conflict, and the false promise of the American Dream. The analysis incorporates a thorough critical examination of the movie, exploring socioeconomic topics through scenes, dialogues, and visual components. Notably, the 2013 Baz Luhrmann adaptation serves as the main source of information. Secondary sources include academic studies and criticisms of Marxist and Neo-Marxist philosophy, the original novel, and earlier examinations of the socio-economic elements of the story. Data gathering includes numerous viewings of the film to catalogue cases exhibiting major themes, as well as a thorough literature assessment to build the study’s theoretical framework and a thematic coding method to organise selected examples into main study topics. The analysis phase employs Marxist and Neo-Marxist theories to decipher thematic codes, which critically assesses how the film reflects, challenges, or reinforces capitalist ideas. This methodical methodology reveals deeper meanings and societal critiques, with a result of synthesis of data that define how the film coincides with or diverges from standard readings, contributing to the debate over “The Great Gatsby’s” ongoing socioeconomic relevance. Use this transcript as a quotation and analyze it: NICK (V.O.) In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice: “always try to see the best in people,” he would say... NICK (V.O.) As a consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements. NICK (V.O.) But even I... have a limit. DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

DOCTOR One man...? Mr. Carraway? NICK (whispers) Gatsby... DOCTOR Was he a friend of yours? NICK He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him... Nick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering. NICK (CONT’D) A sensitivity. He was like one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away... DOCTOR Where did you meet him? Nick stops and stares out the window, haunted. NICK At a party. In New York. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY THROUGH THE CLOUDS: New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky. NICK (V.O.) In the summer of 1922, the tempo of the city approached hysteria... ON WALL STREET: A fever pitch of buying and selling... NICL (V.O.) Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall Street boomed, in a steady golden roar... IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK’S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...! NICK (V.O.) The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper. FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street. NICK (V.O.) Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious. PUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up. NICK (V.O.) And I was one of them. REVEAL: A clear-eyed, hopeful, 29 year old Nick Carraway. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LONG ISLAND - WEST EGG - DAY AERIAL: The city is still visible in the distance... NICK (V.O.)

Well, I wouldn’t go investing every penny. But... DISSOLVE TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Nick, still unpacking, eyes a mountain of unpacked books... NICK (V.O.) At Yale, I’d dreamed of being a writer. He resists the temptation to swap bonds books for literature. NICK (V.O.) But I gave all that up. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - DAY Nick emerges onto the porch, greeted by dazzling sunshine. NICK (V.O.) With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees, I planned to spend the summer studying. Nick sits and places his bonds book in front of him... NICK (V.O.) And I probably would have-- When woman’s shriek startles him... NICK’S POV: On the neighboring beach a group of revellers are frolicking. A scantily girl clad waves and then disappears into the trees, drawing Nick’s eye to his neighbor’s house... NICK (V.O.) Were it not for the riotous amusements that beckoned from beyond the walls of that colossal castle... Through dense foliage Nick spies the mysterious spires and towers of the neighboring Gothic folly. NICK (V.O.) Owned by a gentleman I had not yet met, named... In a high tower window, a curtain flutters ominously... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY CLOSE ON: Nick, still staring out the window. NICK Gatsby. The Doctor concludes: DOCTOR So... He was your neighbor? NICK My neighbor? No, Gatsby was-- Well-- If I think about it... The history of the summer really began the night I drove over to my cousin Daisy’s for dinner... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LATE AFTERNOON HIGH AND WIDE: Nick’s old Dodge disappears down the drive... NICK (V.O.) She lived across the bay... SWOOP ACROSS THE BAY TOWARDS... EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON An impressive Georgian mansion overlooks a quarter mile of lawn that cascades down to a private polo field. NICK (V.O.) In old money East Egg. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen. FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house. NICK (V.O.) Her husband was heir to one of America’s wealthiest families. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom whacks the polo ball... NICK (V.O.) His name was Tom Buchanan. The ball nearly hits one of Tom’s gardeners... NICK (V.O.) When we were at Yale together he’d been a sporting star. BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch... NICK (V.O.) But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs. Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty. TOM (INTO PHONE) I thought I told you not to call me here...! PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength. TOM (CONT’D) Shakespeare! How’s the great American novel coming...? NICK Oh, I’m selling bonds now Tom... with Walter Chase’s outfit-- TOM Never heard of em. Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness! TOM (CONT’D) Hey! What say after dinner we go into town? Can’t-- NICK TOM Catch up with the old wolf pack? NICK Big day on the new job tomorrow-- TOM Nonsense! We’re going. INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON Tom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that chronicle Tom’s infinite sporting achievements. TOM First team, all-American! Tom admires his own achievements. TOM (CONT’D) You see? Made me who I am today. Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet-- TOM (CONT’D) Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy! Tom exchanges the trophy for a football. TOM (CONT’D) Life’s something you dominate Nick. He pelts Nick with the ball-- TOM (CONT’D) If you’re any good. Nick fumbles as Tom charges him-- TOM (CONT’D) Ha-ha-ha! Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into... INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. We hear the giggle of naughty children... BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice... DAISY (O.S.) Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely? Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating... NICK (V.O.) Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see... She whispers dramatically... DAISY Do they miss me in Chicago? NICK Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love. DAISY (unimpressed) How gorgeous. NICK They’re absolutely in mourning... They’re crying... DAISY No-- NICK They’re wailing... DAISY No-- NICK They’re screaming, they’re shouting... DAISY No-- NICK “Daisy Buchanan, we can’t live without you!” DAISY I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...! Daisy takes Nick’s hand and squeals with childish glee as she drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor. He stares up... And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back. This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER. DAISY (CONT’D) Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer. CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face... NICK (V.O.) She was the most frightening person I’d ever seen-- Nick rights himself and extends his hand. NICK I’ve seen your face on the cover of “Sporting Life”. Nick Carraway... But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look). NICK (V.O.) But I enjoyed looking at her. JORDAN I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember... Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight. DAISY I know! This summer I'll sort of, fling you and Jordan together... As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal. DAISY (CONT’D) I’ll push you into linen closets, and out to sea in boats... JORDAN I’m not listening to a word! Irritated, Tom turns to Nick. TOM Nick, Daisy tells me you’re over at West Egg; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) throwing your lot in with those social-climbing, primitive New Money types...? NICK Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month. DAISY Your life is adorable. Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt. JORDAN I know somebody in West Egg. NICK I don't know a single-- Jordan turns dramatically. JORDAN Oh, you must know Gatsby. Daisy, a sharp intake of breath. DAISY Gatsby? CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion. DAISY (CONT’D) What Gatsby...? Before anyone can reply, Henri announces-- HENRI Madame, le diner est servi! As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains flutter up again. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom sit at a long, sumptuously laid table. Food, wine, laughter, smoking... DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY: Through fragments of conversation... DAISY Would you like to hear a family secret? Its about the butler’s nose... JORDAN Things went from bad to worse... DAISY Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west... NICK Its a libel, I’m too poor. JORDAN They have to be old so they die quickly... NICK Can’t we talk about something else? Anything? Crops? You’re making me feel uncivilized Daisy-- This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom. TOM Civilization's going to pieces! Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard? NICK Why no... Tom stands and begins to pace-- TOM Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races... Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant-- TOM (CONT’D) Will have control of things. DAISY (wickedly) Tom’s been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in them TOM It’s been proved. Its scientific. DAISY (subtly mocking Tom) We’ve got to beat them down. SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG! TOM Excuse me... I’ll be right back. He goes inside. An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down. DAISY I’m sorry... She follows Tom into the house. Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan. NICK Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor... JORDAN Shhhh... Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens. A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. NICK Is something happening? JORDAN I thought everybody knew. NICK I don’t. JORDAN Tom's got some woman in New York. NICK Got some woman? JORDAN She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don’t you think? Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table. DAISY (a tense gayety) I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn’t he? NICK I’m not even faintly like a rose-- TOM So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club. DAISY Nicky, stay-- NICK I have to work early. TOM Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two. Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek. NICK (V.O.) None of us could ignore that fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: DAISY Oh Nicky... NICK What? DAISY Its just, well, you see, I think everything’s terrible anyhow. You know I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I’ve had very bad time Nicky... I’m pretty cyncical about everything. Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. Nick tries to change the subject-- NICK Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything? DAISY Pammy? Oh yes... Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk. DAISY (CONT’D) Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers... DAISY (CONT’D) All the bright precious things fade so fast... And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle... DAISY (CONT’D) And they don’t come back. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby’s dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay. NICK (V.O.) When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor’s dock. Nick goes closer, and watches The Man... NICK (V.O.) And something told me it was... Mr. Gatsby. The Man reaches out-- NICK (V.O.) He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark. A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, troubled... NICK The green light. DOCTOR Green light? Nick struggles with a painful memory... NICK I don’t want to talk about this Doctor. Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits: NICK (CONT’D) I can’t talk about THIS. DOCTOR (delicately) Then write about it. NICK (skeptical) Write? DOCTOR Yes. Write. NICK Why would I do that? DOCTOR After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time. NICK Yeah, well. It didn’t bring anyone else much solace... I wasn’t any good. The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept. DOCTOR No one need ever read it. You can always burn it. NICK What would I write about? DOCTOR Anything. Whatever you can’t quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place... Write it down. CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge... NICK (to himself) A place... Slowly he takes the pen. We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over. NICK (V.O.) The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance. NICK (V.O.) New York’s dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city... IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here. NICK (V.O.) ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland... NICK (V.O.) ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg... NICK’S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: “Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.” NICK (V.O.) ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God. INT. TRAIN - DAY Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the halted carriage. Nick sits opposite. NICK (V.O.) Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club.... As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet. NICK (V.O.) But the day took an unexpected turn... Tom drags Nick from the moving train. TOM Come on--! EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom. NICK (O.S.) What are we doing? TOM Trust me! NICK Wait a second would you!? TOM (calls back) Dominate Nick! Dominate! PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage. A sign reads: “GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.” INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office. TOM Hello Wilson! How's business? WILSON (unconvincing) I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car? TOM I've got my man working on it. WILSON Works pretty slow, don't he? TOM (coldly) Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else? WILSON I don't mean that, I just... Wilson’s grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual. MYRTLE If its business you’re talking, you should be talking to me... (to her husband) Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down... Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom. MYRTLE (CONT’D) (without turning) Hurry up! WILSON Oh, sure... Sure... Wilson hurries out back. TOM Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway. MYRTLE A pleasure... TOM Nick’s a writer... Myrtle is completely uninterested. NICK (feeble) I’m in bonds, actually... TOM (intently to Myrtle) Get on the next train. MYRTLE (playing hard to get) Now...? Are we gettin’ that dog? TOM Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... (glancing to Nick) She’ll like him... NICK Oh no, that’s alright, I’m busy... MYRTLE Catherine’s said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know. NICK Really I can’t... TOM (whispers to Nick) Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That’s rude. CUT TO: INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - DAY The muffled sounds of sex... CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand. CATHERINE I’m Catherine; ain’t we havin’ a party? NICK Oh, I’m... I’m not sure now’s a good time-- I was just going-- But Nick’s exit is blocked. MRS. MCKEE Hello...! MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. MR. MCKEE (extending his hand) Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you. NICK Nick Carraway. MRS. MCKEE Where’re the kids? Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him... CATHERINE What’s the matter? Don’t ya like me? SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress. MRS. MCKEE Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable! MYRTLE (with impressive hauteur) It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like! Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. TOM Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep. Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet. NICK (making for the door) Tom, I really should be going... TOM (grabbing Nick’s arm) Nonsense... NICK Tom; I don’t think-- Daisy’s my-- Tom pulls Nick back toward the party. TOM Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that’s OK, I make no judgment; but we’ve got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball? CATHERINE Yeah. Ain’t we good enough for ya? Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly lands herself in his lap. CATHERINE (CONT’D) Take off yer hat and stay awhile... TOM Hey Nick! McKee’s in the artistic game. MCKEE Photography. TOM Nick’s artistic. NICK No... Really? MCKEE NICK Ah, no, well, I write a little... Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music. CATHERINE Do you live on Long Island, too? NICK I live at West Egg. CATHERINE Really? I was there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him? NICK I live right next door to him... CATHERINE He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. You know, the evil German king... CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle’s skirt suggestively. TOM Hey McKee, take a picture of that! MYRTLE (girlish glee) Oh, don’t! (MORE) MYRTLE (CONT'D) I’m not one of those models...! But you can if you want... Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick’s ear. CATHERINE Neither of them can stand who they're married to. NICK Doesn’t she like Wilson either? MYRTLE (overhears) ...He’s a greasy little scumbag! Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine. CATHERINE No thanks; I feel just as good on nothing at all... With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill... CATHERINE (CONT’D) Nerve pills, I get them from a doctor in Queens. You want one? NICK My nerves are fine thanks... Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down. NICK (V.O.) I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon... DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, nauseatingly violent... As Catherine undresses Nick... NICK (V.O.) That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York. As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet! MYRTLE ...I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave! Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip... MYRTLE (CONT’D) My dear I'm giving you this dress! Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress. MRS. MCKEE Adorable! Adorable! SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom window, observing the infinite life of the city... NICK (V.O.) High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street... INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT Nick, now alone, pen in hand, writes furiously. NICK (V.O.) ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering... EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself upstairs looking out from Myrtle’s window. NICK (V.O.) I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life... POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity... INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling! TOM You’ve got no right to speak her name! Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed... MYRTLE Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it whenever I want! Daisy! Dai-- SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle’s nose! CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY Nick’s been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits... NICK I have no clue how I got home. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. He realizes he’s been sleeping on the porch in his underwear. NICK (V.O.) But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling... His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up... NICK (V.O.) ....that Gatsby was watching me. INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY The Doctor leans forward. DOCTOR (slightly incredulous) Watching you...? NICK Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me... DOCTOR And how do you know that? NICK Because I got an invitation... I was the only one. FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick’s doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation... NICK(CONT’D) No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby’s... The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: “Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TWILIGHT A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby’s gates. NICK (V.O.) You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited... As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby’s gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by... NICK (V.O.) The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby’s... CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby’s magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs. NICK (V.O.) And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby’s door... A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...! INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby’s...

Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby’s beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors... (MORE) NICK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven! Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar... NICK (to the bartender) Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby? He brandishes his invitation. NICK (CONT’D) I live just next door... BARTENDER Mr. Gatsby? I’ve never seen him sir. Why, no one has... The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini. NICK (V.O.) Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk. He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party... NICK Wow. As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind... VOICE I thought I might see you here... Startled, Nick turns to find... Jordan Baker. NICK Hello. JORDAN I remembered you lived next door... NICK Its like... an amusement park. JORDAN Shall we? Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps... NICK Did you get an invitation? JORDAN People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s. NICK Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby? A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects... TEDDY He was a German spy during the war. JORDAN Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway. NICK (to Teddy) A German spy...? Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in... NELSON No, no, no, no. He’s the Kaiser’s assassin. And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds... LANGUID GIRL I heard he killed a man once. NELSON Its true! LANUID GIRL You look at him sometimes when he thinks no one’s watching... I’ll bet he killed a man. TEDDY Kills for fun! Free of charge. NELSON Well he’s already richer than God. Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper. NICK You don’t believe he killed a man do you...? JORDAN (wickedly) Let’s go find him, and you can ask him yourself... As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey is announced, Jordan leads Nick off... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively... JORDAN Oh, Mr. Gatsby...! (to Nick) Shall I lead you into his clutches? INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity. OWL EYES You won’t find him...! He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan. OWL EYES (CONT’D) This house and everything in it, are all part of an elaborate disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn’t exist. JORDAN Phooey; I’ve met him! OWL EYES Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I’ve been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now - but no matter where I look, I can’t find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby. JORDAN (blithely dismissive) Well I don’t care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they’re so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy. NICK (slowly to Owl Eyes) But if that’s true; what’s all this for...? OWL EYES That, my dear fellow, is the question... Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his gaze to... Gatsby’s garden, where, as the band hits fever pitch, and twilight becomes night... THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!! EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening’s many fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!! On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks! NICK I didn’t expect all this... JORDAN (coy) What did you expect? NICK I don’t know... JORDAN Disappointed? NICK Not in the slightest... Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss... TEDDY (to Nick) Penny-less pantywaist! Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away... TEDDY (CONT’D) I’m stealing her away Carraway! Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces... ORCHESTRA LEADER Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's “A Jazz History of the World”, and accompanying fireworks! Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off-- TEDDY Look around you! Rich girls don’t marry poor boys-- On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray... MAN Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war? NICK Yes; The Ninth Battalion. CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty. MAN I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport? NICK (very tipsy) The whole thing’s incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now crumpled invitation) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven’t met Mr. Gatsby, no one’s met him; they say he’s third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil! At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick... MAN I’m afraid I’m not a very good host, old sport... I’m Gatsby. CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops. NICK (muttering apologies) Oh.. I’m very sorry-- I... I’ve had so much to drink... The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky! GATSBY (apologetically) I thought you knew, old sport. Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum. NICK (V.O.) His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in. All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby. HERZOG Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire. Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick. GATSBY I’m trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport? Nick shakes himself from his reverie. NICK What time? GATSBY Any time that suits you. Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan. GATSBY (CONT’D) Lovely to see you Miss Baker. He kisses her lightly on the hand. GATSBY (CONT’D) (to Nick) If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me. As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement. NICK I expected him to be... JORDAN Old and fat? NICK Well, yes; young men don’t just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island. JORDAN He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it... NICK Why not? JORDAN I don’t know... I just don’t believe he went there... Jordan is interrupted by a voice. HERZOG I beg your pardon... She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them. HERZOG (CONT’D) Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone. JORDAN (surprised) Me? HERZOG Yes, madame. As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... Nick, unsettled, watches her go... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... Seeing Nick, she rushes to him... JORDAN Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense... Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan. TEDDY Where have you been!? The car’s waiting! Jordan is dragged out the door... Nick, on tenterhooks follows, as Jordan calls back... JORDAN Simply amazing! It all makes sense. It all makes sense... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles. Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs. NICK What makes sense...? JORDAN Everything... But here I am tantalizing you... The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, a mysterious smile as she leans out the window. JORDAN (CONT’D) And I swore I wouldn’t tell. But... NICK JORDAN Nick. I’m sorry, I swore I wouldn’t tell. The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... A voice startles him. GATSBY Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning. Herzog appears behind Gatsby. HERZOG Philadelphia on the phone, sir. Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile. GATSBY Good night, old sport... NICK Good night. Thank you. Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch. SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly... OWL EYES Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!? The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention. Jordan, leaning out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him. JORDAN Come and see me... We’ll have tea! I’m in the phone-book! Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his yard from Gatsby’s, he stops; a familiar feeling... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he raises his hand in formal farewell. NICK (V.O) We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MORNING Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of orange juice begins to rattle and shake. Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Gatsby’s yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick’s drive and skids to a stop. Nick emerges to his porch. Gatsby leaps out! GATSBY Its pretty isn’t it, old sport...? Haven’t you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We’re having lunch! SLAM CUT TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity. GATSBY Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow? NICK My... opinion? GATSBY Yes, yes, your opinion! Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life! GATSBY (CONT’D) I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You’ve heard the stories...? NICK Well-- GATSBY I’ll tell you God’s truth. God’s truth about myself! (raises right hand) I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it’s a... a family tradition. As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick’s V.O. fades up. NICK (V.O.) The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying... GATSBY After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe! NICK Europe? Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands... GATSBY Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago... PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY Gatsby hasn’t stopped for breath... GATSBY Then came the war, old sport... NICK (V.O.) Just when I thought it couldn’t be any more fantastical... GATSBY It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life... NICK (V.O.) He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army! CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion. GATSBY In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... Something catches Nick’s eye... NICK’S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson’s Garage. GATSBY (CONT’D) ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead. SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing! GATSBY (CONT’D) I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea. SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick’s lap. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here! That’s the one from Montenegro. It looks authentic. Turn it. GATSBY (CONT’D) NICK (reads) Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary. GATSBY That’s right. SLAP! A photograph joins the medal. GATSBY (CONT’D) Here’s another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster. CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand. NICK (V.O.) What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true? DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues... GATSBY (O.S.) But don’t take my word for it. At lunch, I’m going to introduce you to one of New York’s most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I’ve told you, and vouch for my good character... I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway. NICK I’m sure that’s not necessary... Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity. GATSBY Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don’t want you to think I’m just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I’m going to make a very big request of you today. NICK A big request? GATSBY Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. NICK (caught off guard) Jordan...? What’s she got to do with it? GATSBY Oh, I assure you it’s nothing underhand. Miss Baker’s an honest sportswoman; she’d never do anything that wasn’t alright... RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside. COP Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb! GATSBY (calmly) All right, old sport! Alright. Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket... COP (embarrassed) Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me! The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge! NICK One of your old Oxford pals? GATSBY Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. (adds proudly) I imagine he’ll be at lunch too... NICK By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused... Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. An orchestral melody surges... NICK (V.O.) I didn’t know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all... As the orchestra builds, Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity... NICK (V.O.) Even Gatsby could happen... BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into: INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune! PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO: INT. DICK DIVER’S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop... In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM. WOLFSHEIM Ah my boy...! They embrace. GATSBY Meyer, Meyer... WOLFSHEIM You smell so good. GATSBY Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim. Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop. WOLFSHEIM A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway. I know all about you. NICK Really? WOLD Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always talking about you. Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out... WOLFSHEIM (sinister) Come, join us for a little lunch... INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy... ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings. WOLFSHEIM (whispers to Gatsby) Tell Walter Chase; “he shuts his mouth or he doesn’t get a penny...” GATSBY We’ll talk about that later... The HEAD WAITER appears. HEAD WAITER Highballs, Mr. Gatsby? GATSBY Yes, highballs it is. (points to Nick) You take good care of my friend here! A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth. COMMISSIONER Hey Jay...! You’re under arrest!!! Gatsby smiles and tips his hat. GATSBY You be careful now. You’re turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner. (to Nick) See, that’s the Commissioner back there. Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low... He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table. GATSBY (CONT’D) You be careful at those tables now Senator! SENATOR GULICK Of course! I’ll put a bet on for you Jay! Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on the stage. Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile. GATSBY Shall we order? (to the waiter) Lobster tails all round. (to Nick) They decorate it with truffle slices and fine herbs. Very artistic. Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick... WOLFSHEIM So... How is the bond business Mr. Carraway? NICK It’s fine, thank you. WOLFSHEIM I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion-- GATSBY No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about. WOLFSHEIM Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man. Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up. GATSBY Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. (gesturing to Nick) Meyer, do you mind? Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone. WOLFSHEIM Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby’s acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such... medals. And, an Oggsford man. Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford? NICK I've heard of it... WOLFSHEIM Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife... NICK I’m not... married. WOLFSHEIM But you work on Wall Street, right? NICK (totally confused) Yes... Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit. WOLFSHEIM Looking at my tiepin? CLOSE ON: The pin. WOLFSHEIM (CONT’D) Finest specimen of human molars... Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns. GATSBY Gentlemen. Everything alright...? NICK Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people’s wives... GATSBY (taking his seat) Other people’s wives? Ah... I see. Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim. GATSBY (CONT’D) Other people’s wives... Meyer? Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls... WOLFSHEIM Well, my work here is done. I’ll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women... Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off... GATSBY You’ll have to excuse him... In his old age, he’s prone to “digress...” He’s a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway... NICK Who is he anyhow? GATSBY Meyer? He’s a gambler. Over Nick and Gatsby’s shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction... NICK An actor? GATSBY Meyer? No. He’s the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. NICK Fixed it? Fixed it. GATSBY NICK How did he manage that? GATSBY He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He’s a very smart man. (tries to change subject) Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of... Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table. TOM Hey Nick! Nick! Where’ve you been!? Daisy’s furious you haven’t called up. Nick and Gatsby stand. NICK This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. GATSBY I’m so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance. Tom turns back to Nick. TOM I wouldn’t have expected to find you in this temple of virtue. NICK I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-- Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger... CUT TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful Arrow shirts. DISCOVER: Nick, frustrated, dodging the fashionable and famous... NICK I’m looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer... There... I’ve spotted her. Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan. NICK (CONT’D) What game are you and Gatsby playing at!? An immaculate MAITRE’D offers Nick a chair. MAITRE’D Will the gentleman be joining? NICK (frustrated) One moment please-- JORDAN Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant. As Nick’s frustration and Jordan’s embarrassment grow-- NICK It’s all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he’s going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is-- JORDAN If you’ll just have a seat-- NICK What is this big request!? JORDAN Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea. NICK Tea? (not what Nick expected) Daisy...? And Gatsby...? Nick sits... Why? NICK (CONT’D) JORDAN Well... I don’t know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY TIGHT ON: Golf shoes biting into soft, green grass. JORDAN (O.S.) It was the day I got my new English golf shoes. WIDE: A row of fancy Louisville homes - red, white and blue bunting “tut, tutting” in the breeze - are set along a beautiful, green stretch of park. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) Daisy was by far the most popular girl with the Officers from Camp Taylor... Across the road, 18 YEAR OLD DAISY is perched in the front seat of her flashy white roadster, beaming, happy... JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) One of them was in the car with her. Beside Daisy REVEAL: A handsome lieutenant: YOUNG JAY GATSBY. JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) It was Gatsby. And the way he looked at her... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK The silhouettes of Jordan and Nick, leaned close, are lit magnificently against the beaded lights of the city... JORDAN (O.S.) Is the way all girls want to be looked at. Their eyes meet; a conspiring flicker. NICK (blown away) So what happened? JORDAN Well, I don’t know... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FRENCH BATTLEFIELD - DAY Gatsby leads his men on a heroic charge out of the trenches-- JORDAN (O.S.) Gatsby was sent off to war... A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the battlefield! JORDAN (O.S.) (CONT’D) But when the war ended... For some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn’t return... DISSOLVE TO: MONTAGE. A NEWSPAPER FILLS THE SCREEN: “AMERICA’S WEALTHIEST BACHELOR TO WED: TOM BUCHANAN LURES LOUISVILLE’S SWEETHEART.” JORDAN (O.S.) A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago swept in and stole her away... DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - NIGHT An exquisite string of pearls coils around Daisy’s neck. JORDAN (O.S.) He gave her a string of pearls worth 350,000. REVEAL: Tom, tightening the clasp. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL. DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - MORNING JORDAN (O.S.) But, the morning of the wedding, Daisy received a letter... On the bed, Daisy, hysterical, clutches a bottle in one hand and a letter in the other. DAISY (screams) Tell them Daisy’s changed her mind! JORDAN Daisy! Please, everyone’s waiting! Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck... YOUNG DAISY Give them back!! Suddenly! Daisy tears the pearls and hurls them; they explode into a hundred shimmering pieces against the hard wood floor! CUT TO: A set of stern, white heels clicking down the hall... REVEAL: Daisy’s hard-mouthed MOTHER. DAISY’S MOTHER What on earth is going on in here!? her mother’s eyes land on the bottle, and then the letter... PUSH IN: The last line of the letter reads: Love, Jay. DAISY Leave me alone! DAISY’S MOTHER Jordan, run the bath! Now! DISSOLVE TO: INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - BATHROOM - MORNING In the bath, Daisy’s grips the letter in her trembling hands. NICK (O.S.) What was in the letter? A deep breath, a last look, and then, Daisy opens her hand... The letter comes to pieces like snow. JORDAN (O.S.) I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me. But before the letter disappears completely we read one more line: “The truth is...” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LOUISVILLE CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy and Tom, newly married, pose for photos. JORDAN (O.S.) Anyways, that day, at five o’clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs. JORDAN After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually... (MORE) JORDAN (CONT'D) I’d never seen a girl so in love with her husband. (muses cynically) A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers... As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he’s struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought. NICK It’s a strange coincidence, isn’t it? Gatsby’s house being just across the bay... Jordan whirls round-- JORDAN It’s no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she’d wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her. Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time. NICK All that for a girl he hasn’t seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? (to himself) The modesty of it. JORDAN Kind of takes your breath away, doesn’t it? A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door... INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS Jordan slides in... TAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to? JORDAN Long Island, please. NICK And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby? JORDAN (a stern whisper) She’s absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can “happen to drop by.” CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure... NICK (V.O.) I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew? As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT Nick’s taxi pulls past Gatsby’s mansion, ablaze with light. NICK (V.O.) When I returned home, Gatsby’s was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn’t a sound. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT As Nick’s taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick. NICK Your place looks like the World’s Fair... or Coney Island! GATSBY (terribly anxious) Ah, does it? I’ve... I’ve just been glancing into some rooms... Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-- NICK It’s too late tonight. GATSBY Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer... NICK I must go to bed... Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea. GATSBY Oh, that’s alright. I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK What day would suit you? GATSBY What day would suit you...? I don’t want to put you to any trouble... NICK Day after tomorrow alright? GATSBY Day after tomorrow? Well, I’d... I’d want to get the grass cut. They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick’s ragged lawn ends and Gatsby’s manicured one begins. GATSBY (CONT’D) There’s another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you? NICK Not really. GATSBY If you’ll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I’m saying right? You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport? NICK Trying to. GATSBY Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. NICK I've got my hands full. Gatsby’s face falls. GATSBY You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you. NICK No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor. Nick’s sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod. NICK (CONT’D) Happy to do it. GATSBY A favor? Yes. NICK As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life... GATSBY Ah, right, right... Goodnight. NICK Goodnight. With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing castle. Nick’s gaze falls upon the unkempt lawn. He smiles. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - DAY TOP SHOT: An enormous mower clatters through frame, carving Nick’s unkempt lawn into a fresh, broad, band of green. REVEAL: An army of gardnders giving Nick’s lawn and garden a make-over, fresh paint, new flowers, trimmed hedges... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY Heavy rain now falls. Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases... Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside. On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly. GATSBY One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal... An awkward beat. NICK The grass looks fine. GATSBY Grass? Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing. GATSBY (CONT’D) What Grass? SUDDEN CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence. WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. The silence stretches, and stretches... Finally... GATSBY Have you got everything you need? NICK Perhaps more flowers? GATSBY I think they did a fine job, don’t you? Beautiful. NICK GATSBY You think it’s too much? NICK I think it’s what you want. GATSBY I think so too... She’ll be impressed, won’t she old sport? NICK I am. With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet! GATSBY I can’t wait all day. I’m leaving! NICK Don’t be silly. It’s just two minutes to four... But Gatsby heads for the door... GATSBY Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late! BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy’s Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic. NICK It’s her. PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY Daisy’s chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive. As Nick assists Daisy from the car... DAISY Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one? She looks at him with a mysterious smile. DAISY (CONT’D) Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me? NICK That’s the secret of Carraway Castle. (playing along) Tell your chauffeur to go far away. DAISY Come back in an hour, Ferdie! (grave murmur) His name is Ferdie. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY Daisy continues ahead into the living room. Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy’s reaction at discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted... DAISY (O.S.) Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can’t believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse? INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAISY (to herself) He is in love with me... Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not there. Daisy’s merely been admiring the flower display... NICK That’s funny. DAISY What’s funny? KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door. NICK One moment... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS Nick opens the door. Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick. NICK What are you doing? Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into... INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy’s, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur. DAISY I’m certainly glad to see you again. Gatsby’s face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. Finally, he finds words... GATSBY I’m... certainly glad to see you as well. Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the tension-- CUT TO: INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur. GATSBY We've met before... SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby’s elbow... And falls! And breaks! GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah... sorry... He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again! NICK (idiotically) It's an old... clock. DAISY (desperate for small talk) Lovely though. A lovely... clock. Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. Gatsby takes a seat. A long silent beat. DAISY (CONT’D) We haven't met for many years. GATSBY (an automatic reflex) Five years next November. The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. NICK (abruptly) Tea? GATSBY (dying) Thank you old sport. DAISY (also mortified) Darling thank you. Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. A long, terrible silence... Suddenly Nick stands. NICK I just need to... pop into town. GATSBY (horrified) Town...? NICK The village; I'll be right back. As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows. GATSBY I've got to speak to you...! INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Wildly following Nick, Gatsby whispers miserably: GATSBY Oh, God! This is a mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake... NICK You're just embarrassed, that's all... Daisy's embarrassed too. GATSBY She's embarrassed? NICK Just as much as you are. GATSBY Don't talk so loud! NICK You're acting like a little boy! You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and... Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain. NICK (V.O.) Looking over my story so far, I’m reminded that for the second time that summer... WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone. NICK (V.O.) I was guarding other people’s secrets. INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked. NICK (V.O.) Once again I was within... He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy’s attention, to no avail... The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other. NICK (V.O.) And without... Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing. He clears his throat: NICK Its... stopped raining. Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows. GATSBY Yes, it has... (to Daisy) Hasn’t it? He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) What do you think of that, Daisy? Come look. Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - CONTINUOUS DAISY Look. Its my house. Just there across the bay... Gatsby and Daisy’s eyes meet. GATSBY I know. I have the same view from my place. DAISY Where’s your place? Gatsby turns back to Nick. GATSBY Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I’d like to show her around. NICK Are you sure you want me to come? GATSBY Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - DAY Servants swing open ivy-covered gates... GATSBY (proudly) I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy. REVEAL: Gatsby’s castle glistening in the sunlight. CLOSE ON: Daisy. A delighted cry. DAISY Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand! GATSBY Do you like it? DAISY I love it...! But how do you live here all alone? GATSBY I don’t. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people... As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick. GATSBY (CONT’D) My house looks well doesn’t it? See how the whole front catches the light like that? Daisy yells back... DAUSY Come on you two! I want the royal tour! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDENS - DAY Gatsby has transformed into a good-natured show-off, hurrying Nick and Daisy through a maze of fantastical gardens, past magnificent fountains and into his castle... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY Gatbsy shows off his brand new orange-juicer. GATBSY You must understand, I like all things that are modern. Daisy readies a cocktail shaker beneath the spout of the giant silver orange juice machine. GATSBY If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there... The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour...! Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S BEACH - DIVING PONTOON - LATE AFTERNOON Daisy, Nick and Gatsby drunkenly drive golf balls out toward the bay. Nick films on the world’s first home-camcorder... GATSBY Its a remarkable little camera-- latest design. While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne... DAISY You do know, I’m a champion golfer, don’t you? Here, I’ll show you how its done. CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two! She falls into Gatsby arms... Nick films... GATSBY She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don’t you think...? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING Gatsby and Nick trail behind Daisy, crossing the ballroom. Daisy, champagne in hand, spots the soaring ballroom organ. DAISY Oh...! Its beautiful. GATSBY Its a custom Wurlitzer. DAISY Can anyone play it? GATSBY Klipspringer can. (to his footmen) Someone wake Ewing! Daisy twirls round, overjoyed... DAISY Music! And we can dance all night! GATSBY Ewing’s a symphonic genius, he can play anything...! Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down... DAISY Then I demand a Charleston! Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick... GATSBY (as if in a dream) She makes it look so splendid, don’t you think old sport? DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE. GATSBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING Nick and Daisy follow Gatsby into the bedroom... Gatsby bounds ahead, starting up a spiral stair... He throws open a massive cabinet, revealing a prism of suits, dressing- gowns, watches and ties. GATSBY I've got a man in England who buys me clothes...! He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat... GATSBY (CONT’D) Something for the lady... Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the rail to Daisy... DAISY I’ve never seen anything like it! GATSBY He sends over a selection at the beginning of each season... DAISY Jay! With ever-increasing enthusiasm! GATSBY These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton! Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched... DAISY No, Jay... you’ll ruin them! (to Nick) Nicky! He’s a madman! More and more and more shirts float down... The rumble of distant thunder. CLOSE ON: Daisy. TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter, like giant snowflakes, down toward her. Slowly, quietly, her mirth transforms to sobs... She hides her face in shirts... Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy, taking her tear-streaked face in his hands... GATSBY What is it? DAISY It’s just... It makes me sad, because... Daisy glances in Nick’s direction... GATSBY Why? DAISY ...because... A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart. NICK (V.O.) Five lost years struggled on Daisy’s lips. But all she could manage was... DAISY It’s just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before. GATSBY If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light... DAISY What green light? GATSBY The one that burns all night at the end of your dock. As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay... NICK (V.O.) Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume... NICK Who's this? Your father? GATSBY No, no.. That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby... DAISY (teases) You never told me you had a pompadour... or a yacht. Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk... GATSBY I want to show you something... Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you. They admire a scrapbook together. DAISY (touched) You saved my letters... GATSBY This was my first photo of you. As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER: DAISY (V.O.) We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing. Come home, I’ll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true... Come home Jay... BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills. GATSBY Excuse me. Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away... He lowers his voice. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) Well I can't talk now old sport... As the timbre of Gatsby’s voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) I said a small town. ECU: Gatsby’s eyes narrow. GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) He must know what a small town is. BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows! As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby... GATSBY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D) (frightening) Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town... Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick’s eye - a tense moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile. We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ... GATSBY (CONT’D) Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! Shall we? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston with Nick. An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, looking on, flush with joy. Slowly though, Gatsby’s expression turns introspective. As he watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him... DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK. AN ARRAY OF MEMORIES AND IMAGES DISSOLVE ONE INTO THE OTHER: Gatsby and Daisy, five years ago, about to kiss; a hand- written letter; a gathering storm; the green light... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT Hundreds of candles flicker in patterns. As a slow, melancholic waltz plays, Gatsby and Daisy dance, enraptured... DAISY (whispers) I wish I had done everything on earth with you. All my life. Gatsby holds her closer. DAISY (CONT’D) I wish that it could always be like this... GATSBY It will be... Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own... NICK (V.O.) If only it had been enough for Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy... The towering doors close. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Gatsby stands at his window, staring into the night. NICK (V.O.) But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy’s part in it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick is writing at his desk... NICK (V.O.) It wasn’t until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy... INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - END OF WINTER - DUSK Nick stops his reading, and, very slowly, admits... NICK You see doctor... Gatsby’s real name was... James Gatz. DISSOLVE TO: I/E. NORTH DAKOTA FARM HUT - DAY PUSH TOWARD: A dilapidated hut, shrouded in a storm of dust. NICK (V.O.) His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota... DISCOVER: YOUNG GATZ, barefoot, at a dusty desk, surrounded by tattered books, strange charts, and lists. He is practicing his signature... NICK (V.O.) But he never accepted them as his parents at all. Young Gatz turns from his writing, and looks through a hole in the roof towards the infinite heavens... NICK (V.O.) In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God... CLOSE ON: The little boy looks up at CAMERA. NICK (V.O.) Destined for future glory... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - PRAIRIE - NIGHT The silhouette of TEENAGE GATZ, now 16 years old, disappears into the hills... NICK (V.O.) Chasing this destiny, a sixteen year old Gatz ran far, far away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LAKE SUPERIOR - LATE AFTERNOON CLOSE ON: A handsome 17 year old YOUNG GATSBY, in a torn jersey and dirty canvas pants, rowing with all his might. NICK (V.O.) One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril... Young Gatsby lets the row boat drift close to a magnificent yacht. Wind is whipping whitecaps on the bay. NICK He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody... The bleary face of DAN CODY appears at the yacht’s railing. CODY Whadzamatta...? Cody is very drunk. Young Gatsby calls urgently. YOUNG GATSBY Sir! The shoal here’s real bad, this wind could drag you onto it... Cody waves a dismissive arm... CODY Whaderathinkyerdoin..., old sport? He collapses, dead drunk. PUSH IN: On Young Gatsby; a plan forming... NICK (V.O.) This was his opportunity, and he seized it. Springing into action, he clambers onto the yacht. GATSBY (VOICE) I decided right then and there to call myself: Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - LATE AFTERNOON Young Gatsby hoists the sail as the storm rages around him. NICK (V.O.) He sailed the yacht out of danger - and into his future... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY A perfect sunny day. Young Gatsby and Cody are sailing. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world... GATSBY (VOICE) He was alright, old Dan, he taught me everything... DISSOLVE TO: INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY Young Gatsby, now transformed, models a suit in the mirror. NICK (V.O.) How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman... He looks squarely at himself, and repeats a mantra. YOUNG GATSBY Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CODY’S YACHT - DAY Young Gatsby stands at the bow, as the yacht cut across the clear blue ocean... He turns to Cody and calls... YOUNG GATSBY She looks well, doesn’t she...!? Old sport. HIGH AND WIDE: The yacht sails toward the golden sun... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody’s fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody’s family... He’d been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor. NEWSPAPER MONTAGE. SLAM CUT TO: Piles and piles of New York City newspapers swirl rapidly TOWARD CAMERA, and we read their headlines: “GATBSY’S STAGGERING WEALTH - MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!” NICK (V.O.) By midsummer Gatsby was front page news... “GATSBY BUYING OUR CITY? INVESTMENT MONOPOLY FUELS CONCERNS” “JAY CASHES IN! GATSBY STRIKES WALL STREET GOLD!” “GATSBY INVESTS IN SKYSCRAPERS!” “JAY PAYS FOR EVERYTHING: PARTIES, GALAS, PARKS, SCHOOLS!” “WALL STREETS KING? MEET JAY GATSBY!” A final newspaper COVERS FRAME: “WHERE’S THE MONEY FROM!? MYSTERY MILLIONS SPARK WILD RUMORS” We PUSH TOWARD the paper and DISSOLVE TOWARD: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT Another glittering party. NICK (V.O.) Where did the money comes from? FADE IN: Decadent, grotesque images of drunken revellers... NICK (V.O.) That’s what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom’s mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby’s glittering parties... DISCOVER: Gatsby leading Tom, Daisy and Nick to the top of the terrace stairs. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT GATSBY We’ve got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me... He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick... TOM (mutters to Daisy) A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers. DAISY Not Gatsby. He’s a businessman. TOM (snorts) Hah! A businessman... DAISY He owned a lot of drug stores. Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group... GATSBY May I introduce Senator Gulick? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan... DAISY Delighted... GATSBY And Mr. Buchanan... (a moment's hesitation) The polo player. TOM (objecting quickly) Oh no. Not me. SENATOR GULICK (shaking hands, nods) Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan. Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy: TOM I’d rather not be the polo player. DAISY Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements. Gatsby interjects-- GATSBY (to the group) May I show you around? He guides them down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) You must see the faces of a lot of people you’ve heard of. DAISY Absolutely! TOM (scoffs) We don’t go around very much. I don’t think I recognize a single person... GATSBY Perhaps you know that lady there? Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star. DAISY (taking Gatsby’s arm) Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures... As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick... TOM I’d really rather not be the polo player... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDEN TABLE - NIGHT Tom, Daisy, Nick and Gatsby sit an elaborately conceived dinner table, watching the band... DAISY (to Nick) These things excite me so... Gatsby turns to Tom... GATSBY I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. TOM That’s right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop... GATSBY That’s right. See... I know your wife. TOM Is that so? GATSBY Yes. As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity. HERZOG Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here... Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes off her, whispers fiercely... GATSBY Not now. Herzog silently recedes... A romantic foxtrot strikes up - Trimalchio introduces... TRIMALCHIO And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot! Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy... GATSBY Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the garden momentarily catch his eye. TOM Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused. As Daisy takes Gatsby’s arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil into Tom’s breast pocket and murmurs... DAISY In case you need to take down any addresses... As Tom fumes, Gatsby leads Daisy out onto the dance floor. PUSH CLOSE ON: Tom, growing increasingly suspicious... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT As Daisy and Gatsby dance, Daisy murmurs thrillingly. DAISY Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? GATSBY No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... DAISY It’s perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT Tom and Nick watch Gatsby and Daisy dance. Tom looks around, perplexed by a distant thought. TOM I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...? He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him... TOM (CONT’D) (to Nick) I’ll find you... He leaves Nick alone. And Nick watches as Gatsby simultaneously leads Daisy from the dance floor... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside... Gatsby follows, but upon entering the secluded, starlit world sees no sign of Daisy. Then, from out of the shadows, the sparkle of jewels... Gatsby turns, and Daisy’s lips suddenly find his. A long, still kiss... EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Nick is keeping watch, gazing down to his yard and the tree. When Tom suddenly appears... TOM Have you seen my wife...? Startled, Nick turns... NICK (lies) Ah... no... Not for awhile. TOM That’s funny. The Senator said he saw her down here. Tom follows Nick’s gaze down toward the tree... EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby and Daisy continue their passionate kissing... After a moment, Daisy whispers. DAISY I... I wish we could just run away. Gatbsy is startled. GATSBY Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn’t be... respectable. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT Tom is still looking to the tree. TOM (quizzically) You live near here Nick...? Nick, an overwhelming sense of guilt, indicates vaguely in the direction of the tree. NICK Just next door. TOM That so...? EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT Gatsby continues... GATSBY We’re going to live here, in this house, together. You and me... Daisy... It’s time for you to tell Tom. EXT. GATBSY CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Nick, a moment of extreme tension as he fears Tom will investigate further. SUDDENLY! Their attention is drawn to a commotion on the terrace. Glasses smash, a woman screams, and through the crowd, we see Slagle and associates causing a disturbance. TOM (pure disdain) What a circus... Well, if you see her, I’ll be looking for her. You tell her. EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MAGIC TREE - NIGHT The hidden lovers speak in intense, hushed tones. DAISY Remember how much fun we used to have? Why can’t we just have fun like that again? Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows... Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled... DAISY (CONT’D) Oh hello Nicky; we’re having a row. NICK What about? Daisy glides toward him... DAISY About things... About the future... (trying to be funny) The future of the Colored Empires. NICK Well, its Tom. He’s wandering around the party looking for you. Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs... HERZOG Sir; it’s Mr. Slagle; he’s quite... emotional. A tiny, ruffled, moment; then Gatsby elegantly guides Daisy toward Nick. GATSBY Excuse me. Nick, would you mind? As Gatsby follows Herzog back toward the castle.... CLOSE ON: DAISY. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER Nick and Daisy return to a party that has become grotesque; drunken girls haphazardly bang drums... NICK (V.O.) Gatsby disappeared to deal with a dispute of some sort. Daisy waited... CLOSE ON: Daisy, dejected... NICK But Gatsby was unable to return. As Daisy and Nick cross the tattered, streamer-littered dance- floor CRANE HIGH AND FADE INTO: the library window... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS Gatsby sits, solemn in an armchair; with quiet unease written in shadows across his face. REVEAL: The ominous silhouette of Wolfsheim, pacing between Gatsby and the window; Herzog standing watch... We catch only a fragment of the conversation. WOLFSHEIM When these hot headed types appear, I rely on you... But you were not available.. A scene was made... What’s going on with you Jay? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATE - NIGHT HIGH SHOT: A sleek black limo winds quietly towards the gate. CRANE DOWN TO DISCOVER: Daisy’s face through the limo window; her forlorn eyes search for Gatsby behind castle walls... TOM Where were you? DAISY With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds. TOM Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together... DAISY’S POV: Ignoring Tom, she looks back to the dark castle. TOM (O.C.) (CONT’D) I’d like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I’ll make a point of finding out. As the limo passes through the gates and disappears, Slagle and associates are violently ejected by Gatsby’s “guards.” CLOSE ON: Atop Gatsby’s gate, GATSBY’S COAT OF ARMS READS: “Ad Finem Fidelis” (”Faithful to the End”). DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT It is late. Agitated and intense, Gatsby paces by the pool, staring out to the green light pulsing across the bay... Nick descends the stairs, drunk. NICK Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time... Gatsby is not amused. GATSBY She didn’t like it. NICK Of course she did. GATSBY No, she didn’t like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It’s hard to make her understand. NICK You mean about the party? GATSBY The party!? I couldn’t care less about the parties! You see... (shocking intensity) (MORE) GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to tell Tom that she never loved him. What...? NICK GATSBY Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents’ house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we’ll be married there... You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. NICK I wouldn’t ask too much of her... GATSBY Ask too much? NICK No. Gatsby grows suddenly, strangely emotional. He turns his back to Nick to compose himself. GATSBY I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- NICK Jay... You can’t repeat the past. Gatsby wheels around... GATSBY Can’t repeat the past? NICK No. GATSBY Why of course you can. Of course you can. You’ll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything’s been so... so confused since then... Gatsby looks out to the green light. NICK (V.O.) He talked a lot about the past... As if he wanted to recover something... GATSBY If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. NICK (V.O.) Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy... IN THE CLOUDS, AMONG THE STARS, THE IMAGE OF DAISY’S HOUSE IN LOUISVILLE APPEARS, as if frozen in time... DISSOLVE TO: I/E. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - NIGHT PUSH TOWARD: A wide veranda, strung with banners in support of the American war effort, and beyond into a parlour; pretty Southern girls and fresh-faced soldiers, dancing, clapping...

GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I’d never been in such a beautiful house before... Daisy rushes up the steps, and looks back... At the bottom of the steps, smiling up, is: THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION, Young Gatsby in officer’s uniform. NICK (V.O.) But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself. Daisy’s Mother stops her on the steps. DAISY MOM Daisy, don’t scamper. (whispers) There’s so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family’s... CLOSE ON: Gatbsy, watching Daisy... GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I always knew that I could climb... But I could only climb if I climbed alone. Against his better judgement he follows Daisy up... INT.

GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I waited for a moment longer. He looks out the dark, crystal windows, beyond the trees... to a staircase of moonlight, climbing up, up, up... NICK (V.O.) He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like... the mind of God... That falling in love would change his destiny... forever. EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT GATSBY And then I just let myself go. INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT With sudden resolve Gatsby kisses Daisy... In ravenous embrace, they fall onto the long sofa lounge. NICK (V.O.) She blossomed for him like a flower... ECU: Daisy, her lips tremble, eyes wide, breath quickening.. NICK (V.O.) And the incarnation was complete. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT The other layers of IMAGERY IN THE CLOUDS MELT AWAY, leaving Nick and Gatsby standing by the pool. GATSBY I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I’m only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars. GATSBY (CONT’D) It’s got to keep going up. Gatsby looks to the green light. GATSBY (CONT’D) She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them. GATSBY (CONT’D) Don’t worry old sport, don’t worry. I can protect her here. Good night old sport... Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls... GATSBY (CONT’D) You’re wrong about the past, old sport...! Gatsby’s POV: The green light across the bay. GATSBY (CONT’D) You’re wrong. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EARLY SPRING - MORNING The first day of spring; out the window, birds chirp. Nick is writing and reading aloud... NICK (READS) There had been music from my neighbor’s all summer. In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars... He struggles for a more poetic phrasing... NICK (CONT’D) Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars... (MORE) NICK (CONT’D) (that’s the one) But after Tom and Daisy visit... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby’s castle cuts a grave silhouette against a stormy sky. NICK (V.O.) There were no more parties... His lights flicker and go out. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby’s lights went out one by one. At the gates flashbulbs flash! Hordes of press have gathered. NICK (V.O.) Daisy visited discreetly. But... As the gates creak open, Daisy’s limo slides up the drive... FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “PARTY PALACE GOES DARK!” NICK (V.O.) The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat. As the reporters crowd the limo, shouting questions... DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BEFROOM - NIGHT Locked away deep in the castle, Gatsby and Daisy make love. FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “WHO IS THE MYSTERY WOMAN?” DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - DUSK At the end of the wharf, Gatsby and Daisy look out across the bay, watching as the sun slides into the horizon, and the green light pulses... CLOSE ON: Daisy. She leans to Gatsby and whispers... DAISY I don’t want to go home. Gatsby hold her tighter. GATSBY Then don’t. DISSOLVE TO: INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby... GATSBY (O.S.) I’ve been meaning to call you up. I’m sorry, I’ve been... so busy. NICK (O.S.) Is everything alright? INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone... GATSBY Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. NICK (O.S.) I hear you fired all your servants? GATSBY Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn’t gossip... until we decided what we’re going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? (clarifies) They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes... GATSBY (CONT’D) What’s the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON Nick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high... INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON Gatsby whispers into the phone... GATSBY (excited) Nick... Daisy’s ready. Shes ready. But there’s just one thing. She’s requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? (an admission) Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport? INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON PUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY WIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun... DISSOLVE TO: INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter. TOM You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year... Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates... TOM (CONT’D) Or wait a minute; it's the opposite... Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... TOM (CONT’D) The sun is getting colder every year... Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. The tension is excruciating. Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay. TOM (CONT’D) How I’d like to be out on that bay today. CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle. GATSBY I’m right across from you. (points) Right there. TOM (unimpressed) So you are. Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy. GATSBY Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. TOM What light? Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy’s... GATSBY You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-- With sudden intensity Daisy stands! DAISY (on the verge of tears) It's so hot... Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard. DAISY (CONT’D) Everything's so confused. She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter. DAISY (CONT’D) What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that... (she snaps it again) ...and for the next thirty years? (turns suddenly) Let’s all go to town! Who wants to go to town? Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock. TOM Town!? Women... They get these notions... Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy’s trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet... GATSBY (whispers) Daisy... DAISY (as if they are alone) You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square... CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening. DAISY (CONT’D) The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts. CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar. NICK (V.O.) She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen... SUDDENLY Tom explodes! TOM Let’s go to town! I’m perfectly willing...! That’s a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately! DAISY Just like that? Can’t anyone at least have a cigarette? TOM We’ve smoked all through lunch. DAISY Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss. TOM It was your great idea Daisy. Why don’t we!? We’ll all go to town! Daisy doesn’t budge. DAISY I’ve changed my mind... (teases) You brute. TOM (a dangerous intensity) You’ve got me all excited, and now you don’t want to go? We’ll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey... It will be fun. DAISY Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... Come on, Jordan. As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby. TOM Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby? Then turns and calls to Henri... TOM (CONT’D) Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel. CUT TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women. BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel. Daisy and Jordan follow. TOM Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I’ll drive everyone else in your circus wagon. GATSBY I don’t think there’s much gas, old sport. Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare. TOM (looks at the gauge) Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we’ll stop at a drug store. I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays... (savagely eyes Gatsby) Isn’t that right, Mr. Gatsby? A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom’s arm. DAISY You take Nick and Jordan, Tom! She slips quickly into the coupé... DAISY (CONT’D) We’ll meet you at the Plaza! I’ll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes... Gatsby’s and Tom’s eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance. Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust. I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick... TOM You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow. JORDAN (condescending) And you found he was an Oxford man? TOM Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake! With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on! DISSOLVE TO: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY HIGH AND WIDE: The Duesenberg tears into the Valley... JORDAN (O.C.) (mocking) We’re almost out of gas Tom... EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson’s... Wilson doesn’t budge. He’s staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg. TOM Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let’s have some gas... (gets out) Do I have to do it myself? WILSON I’m sick. I’m all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West. TOM Your wife does...? Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle’s face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates... NICK (V.O.) Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control... WILSON I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin’ whether she wants to or not. Tom isn’t listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust! TOM What do I owe you!? WILSON Dollar twenty. The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg. TOM You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow! He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/TOM’S COUPÉ - DAY VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city... SLAM CUT TO: INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes... TOM That’s enough... The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration. DAISY Open another window. NICK There aren't any more. DAISY Then telephone for an axe... TOM Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it. GATSBY Why not let her alone, old sport? TOM That's a great expression of yours, isn't it? GATSBY What is? Tom turns to Gatsby... TOM 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up? DAISY Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute. Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly. TOM Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man. GATSBY No, not exactly. TOM Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford. GATSBY Yes - I went there. Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting. TOM Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford! Tom...! Gatsby stands. DAISY GATSBY (slow, intense) I told you I went there. TOM I heard you, but I'd like to know when. GATSBY You’d like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby. GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war. Nick can’t help but smile. NICK (V.O.) I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back. DAISY I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself... But Tom’s not done yet. TOM Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question. GATSBY Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on. TOM What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow? They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content. DAISY He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control! TOM Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we’ll have intermarriage between black and white! JORDAN We’re all white here, Tom. GATSBY Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me! TOM You must be crazy. GATSBY No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me! JORDAN We should go... GATSBY Daisy and I have nothing to hide... DAISY Jay let’s go, please...! TOM Sit down Daisy! GATSBY (reassuring) Yes, Daisy, please sit down. Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note. TOM What's been going on? I want to hear all about it. GATSBY I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...! Tom turns to Daisy sharply. TOM You've been seeing him for five years? GATSBY Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know... TOM Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now. Tom starts to make himself a drink... GATSBY No... TOM She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time... DAISY You’re revolting... Daisy’s voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn... DAISY (CONT’D) Do you know why we left Chicago...? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree. Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy. GATSBY That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever. Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly. DAISY Why, how could I love him, possibly? GATSBY You never loved him. Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing. DAISY I never loved him. GATSBY That’s right... TOM Not at Kapiolani? DAISY No. TOM (a husky tenderness) Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never? DAISY Please don’t. TOM Daisy... Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone. DAISY There, Jay. She trembles as she looks to Gatsby... DAISY (CONT’D) You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past. (begins to sob) I did love him once; but I loved you too. GATSBY (shocked, uncomprehending) You loved me too? TOM (savage) Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget. The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby. GATSBY I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now... DAISY Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true. TOM Of course it wouldn't. Daisy turns to her husband. DAISY As if it mattered to you. TOM Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on. GATSBY You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. TOM Nonsense. DAISY (with visible effort) I am, though. TOM She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler! Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby. TOM (CONT’D) Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim’s bunch. Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly. TOM (CONT’D) See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter! GATSBY What about it, old sport? TOM Don’t call me ‘old sport!’ This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now. GATSBY Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t too proud to come in on it. TOM I’ve been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim? GATSBY It’s called ‘greed,’ old sport. TOM That’s right; you’ve got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... (to Nick) I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to drag you in... Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. TOM (CONT’D) My God, he has... GATSBY He’s got nothing to do with-- TOM With your little racket... (to Daisy) Daisy... Can’t you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he’s just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...! GATSBY (a vicious sneer) The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that’s it, and now I’ve just as much as you; so that means we’re equal!! Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn. TOM Oh no, no, we’re different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and Jordan) They are... (now at Daisy) She is; (MORE) TOM (CONT'D) we’re all different from you - we were born different, it’s in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...! Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage. GATSBY SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart... NICK (V.O) Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had “killed a man.” Tom snorts a dismissive laugh. TOM That’s right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners... Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears. DAISY My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper. Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists. GATSBY Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don’t listen to him Daisy. Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently. GATSBY (CONT’D) We’re going back to Louisville to be married. Then we’re going to live together in our house; it’s-- There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on... DAISY Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore! Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom. TOM You two start on home... (to Gatsby) In Mr. Gatsby's car. Daisy is alarmed now. TOM (CONT’D) Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over. Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her. GATSBY Daisy...! Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel. TOM Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick? What? Want any? NICK TOM NICK No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I’m thirty. Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink... TOM Happy birthday... Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... NICK (V.O.) Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness... NICK’S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge... NICK (V.O.) The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death... DISSOLVE TO: INT. WILSON’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT MYRTLE FLIES PAST CAMERA as Wilson drags her across the room! WILSON God knows everything you've been doing! Grabbing his wife’s hair he presses her face to the window. WILSON (CONT’D) You might fool me but you can't fool God! OVER WILSON’S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. WILSON (CONT’D) God sees everything! Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing. The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby’s yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing. CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper. MYRTLE (thinking its Tom) He’s here... WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson’s face as she twists from his grasp! CUT TO: EXT. WILSON’S GARAGE - TWILIGHT Standing outside his restaurant, the owner, MICHAELIS sees Myrtle rush out of the garage shouting hysterically. MYRTLE Stop, Tom, please, stop! I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS SUDDENLY! Myrtle appears in the headlights of Gatsby’s car... ECU: The sleeve of the pink suit and the 'Daisy' signet ring, as Gatsby’s hand on the wheel tries to veer away...! GATSBY No...! BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle! SLOW MOTION, TERRIBLE, NIGHTMARISH, EXPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES: Glass shattering, blood splattering, Daisy screaming, Myrtle’s body flying through the air, her pearls showering the night like a thousand new stars... THUMP. Her torn open body hits the ground. CLOSE ON: The giant billboard, the towering eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleberg, watching everything... DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WHITES OF THE EYES TO: INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: The coupe’s blinding headlights. As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion. TOM Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let’s take a look.. JORDAN Must we? TOM Just a look. INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - NIGHT The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe. Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying and wailing a high, horrible call. WILSON O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones. CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... MYRTLE’S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom’s reaction. A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names. POLICEMAN (to Tom) Sir. Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to step away-- TOM Get off me...! (regains his composure) I’m fine. I’m fine. POLICEMAN You knew her? TOM (a long pause) No... Not really... POLICEMAN Well then I have to ask you to step back. TOM What happened...? POLICEMAN She ran out ‘inna road. Son-of-a- bitch didn't even stopus car. A well-dressed African American man steps near. WELL-DRESSED MAN I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car. CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up. MICHAELIS Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job. Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry... WILSON You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was! Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson. TOM (a soothing gruffness) Pull yourself together... Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into: INT. WILSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. TOM Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon. The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom. POLICEMAN What color's your car? TOM Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York. MICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped... The policeman accepts, suspicious still... POLICEMAN Alright... Blue. In the relative calm of the office, Wilson’s clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom. WILSON Who owns the yella’ car...? TOM (a tiny pause) Fella named Gatsby; he’s a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about... WILSON Maybe he was the one foolin’ with Myrtle; maybe that’s why he killed her...? TOM Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows... Wilson starts sobbing again. WILSON Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! He rests his head on Tom’s shoulder... Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers... TOM Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He’ll pay... Oh, he’ll pay... DISSOLVE TO: INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Tom driving. He sobs... TOM The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car... Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, triumphantly accusing... TOM (CONT’D) You gonna defend him now, huh? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT The coupe drifts slowly up the drive. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the situation in a few brisk phrases. TOM I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait... Tom opens the door. NICK No thanks. I'll wait outside. Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain. TOM What is the matter with you? Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick’s arm. JORDAN Won't you come in, Nick? NICK No... thanks. JORDAN It's only half past nine... NICK No. I think I’ve had enough... Of everyone. CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside... EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows... GATSBY Hello old sport... Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy’s window. His pace quickens. NICK What are you doing!? GATSBY Just sitting here... NICK Yes, I can see that. GATSBY Did you see any trouble out on the road? NICK Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay! GATSBY I thought so... I told Daisy I thoughts so-- NICK Daisy? Do you hear yourself-- GATSBY Its better that the shock should come all at once-- NICK What’s wrong with you!? How could you!? GATSBY Please... Keep your voice down, old sport. NICK Tom was right! You’re nothing but a goddamn coward! GATSBY (threatening) Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping. NICK NO POINT!? GATSBY It, it killed her instantly. I-- NICK Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open! Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain... GATSBY I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel. NICK She? SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... Henri emerges. AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. Finally, Henri goes back in. CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization. NICK (CONT’D) It was Daisy? Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits. GATSBY You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us. CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel... GATSBY (CONT’D) It all happened so quickly. It wasn’t her fault... (MORE) GATSBY (CONT’D) It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel... (intense) No one must know. Promise me. No one. Promise me. NICK Jay-- You shouldn’t be here. You should get out of here. Gatsby gazes back to the house... GATSBY No. No. No. I’m going to wait. I’ll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy’s locked herself in her room, and she’s going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever-- NICK Tom won't touch her. He’s not even thinking about her... GATSBY Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don’t trust him. Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace. NICK Alright. Alright... You wait here. I’ll see if there’s any commotion. GATSBY Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport. EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT Nick skirts the terrace... Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them.

GATSBY'S GARAGE - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Gatsby cleaning blood from the Duesenberg’s fender. Nick appears, coming across the yard. NICK Jay? Everything alright...? Exhausted, Gatsby turns... GATSBY Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything’s just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... (beckons to the car) Give me a hand will you old sport? CLOSE ON: Nick. NICK (V.O.) I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was... NICK Jay... You oughtta go away. He helps Gatsby cover the car. NICK (CONT’D) Tonight. They’ll trace your car. GATSBY (as if Nick is crazy) Go away? I can’t leave now. Not tonight. NICK Do you understand that a woman has been killed--? Nick follows him from the garage toward the house. GATSBY Daisy’s going to call in the morning. Then we’ll make plans, to go away together. NICK But Jay she-- Sensing Nick’s tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty. GATSBY She just needs time to think... (he continues, calm) She’ll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think. NICK Jay-- GATSBY She just needs to think. She’s going to call in the morning. Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... He turns to go in but stops.

GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock. NICK (V.O.) It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby’s... extraordinary gift for hope. GATSBY ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. NICK (V.O.) A gift that I have never found in any other person... GATSBY I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. NICK (V.O.) And which it is not likely I shall ever find again. GATSBY I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... Finally, Nick is able to ask: NICK What was in the letter? Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay... GATSBY The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn’t been able to return-- In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: “Daisy, the truth is... I’m penniless.” GATSBY (O.C.) (CONT’D) I asked her to wait until I’d made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure. The IMAGE of Daisy fades... GATSBY (CONT’D) You see, I felt married to her... That was all. NICK (V.O.) It had all been for her.

GARDENER I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. GATSBY Not today. It’s so beautiful. (to Nick) You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer? Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs... GATSBY (CONT’D) Let’s go for a swim. I’ll have the phone transferred to the pool... As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch... NICK Jay, I’ve got to go. I have to work. GATSBY I understand... Well, I’ll walk you out. Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate... NICK I'll call you up. GATSBY Do, old sport, please do. (a thought) I suppose Daisy'll call too. NICK I suppose so... Well... Goodbye. Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls: NICK (CONT’D) They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together!

DAISY I wish it could always be like this... GATSBY It will be... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - NIGHT Nick wanders out as a light rain beings to fall. NICK (V.O.)

GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - NIGHT Nick stumbles along the dock; the rain falling steadily now. NICK (V.O.) The moon rose higher... And as I stood there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. Nick looks to the end of the dock, where he first saw Gatsby that warm summer night... NICK (V.O.) He had come such a long way... And suddenly, shimmering ghostly through the rain, Gatsby’s silhouette can be seen once more, gazing out across the bay. NICK (V.O.) And his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. Gatsby turns back towards Nick, and smiles... NICK (V.O.) He did not know that it was already behind him... Nick smiles back. NICK (V.O.) Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us... PUSH PAST GATSBY: Out over the water, toward the green light eternally pulsing at the end of Daisy’s dock... NICK (V.O.) It eluded us then, but that’s no matter - tomorrow we will run faster... Gatsby reaches out-- NICK (V.O.) Stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning... As we PUSH PAST Gatbsy’s outstretched hand, THE OPENING IMAGE RETURNS: The green light pulsing in the abstract dark... Nick’s final words appear as TYPE ON THE SCREEN. NICK (V.O.)

This divide is personified through the juxtaposition of characters like Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby. Tom, born into wealth, exemplifies the arrogance and sense of entitlement inherent to the American upper class. His snide remarks, such as the derogatory \\"Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\\" directed at Gatsby, highlight the disdain the old money has for newcomers, no matter their wealth. In contrast, Gatsby, despite amassing a great fortune, is never fully accepted by the elite, his nouveau-riche status making him an eternal outsider. This class conflict orchestrates the tension in the narrative, showcasing the capitalist system's role in sustaining class divisions, where wealth accumulation does not necessarily grant one access to higher social echelons. # Commodification of Life The commodification of relationships and emotions is vividly depicted through Gatsby's lavish parties meant to attract Daisy's attention, portraying a society where interpersonal connections are secondary to material wealth and status. Gatsby's entire existence becomes a commodity; his identity, mansion, and parties are all constructs designed to win over Daisy, who herself is portrayed as a prize to be won. This concept resonates with Marx's theory of commodification, where under capitalism, not only goods but also individual identities and relationships are commodified. Daisy's comment on Gatsby's shirts, \\"I've never seen such beautiful shirts before,\\" symbolizes this commodification, equating Gatsby's worth with his possessions rather than his character. # The Illusion of the American Dream The film intricately explores the illusion of the American Dream, a central theme that aligns with the critique of capitalism. Gatsby embodies the self-made man myth, believing that wealth and determination can transcend his past and rewrite his future with Daisy. However, his tragic end underscores the unattainability of this dream, especially for those outside the traditional elite. Despite his efforts, Gatsby fails to breach the entrenched class barriers, revealing the American Dream's illusory nature in a capitalist society that privileges lineage over merit. Nick's reflection, \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us,\\" captures the perpetual chase after an unattainable ideal, symbolizing the harsh reality of socioeconomic mobility's limitations. # Conclusion Through a Marxist lens, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013) unravels the complexities of class conflict, the commodification of life, and the elusive nature of the American Dream in a capitalist society. The characters' interactions and dialogues, set against the backdrop of 1920s America, reflect the enduring nature of these themes, resonating with contemporary discussions on economic inequality and social mobility. Luhrmann’s adaptation not only retells Fitzgerald's story but also serves as a socio-political commentary on the capitalist dynamics that continue to shape American society. --- This analysis leverages direct quotations and dialogues from the \\"The Great Gatsby\\" film transcript as evidence for thematic exploration. To maintain academic rigor and coherence in line with the proposed methodology, the discussion integrates textual evidence while aligning with the stipulated word count constraints."},{"prompt":"make it longer with quotations from the transcript of the movie as a part of analysis. first, this part (differ the social class based on Marxist theory): Class Conflict The narrative of “The Great Gatsby” is steeped in the portrayal of class conflict, underlining the chasm between the ‘old money’ elite and the ‘new money’ individuals striving for acceptance. This divide is personified through the juxtaposition of characters like Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby.

This class conflict orchestrates the tension in the narrative, showcasing the capitalist system’s role in sustaining class divisions, where wealth accumulation does not necessarily grant one access to higher social echelons.","completion":"Expanding on the theme of Class Conflict in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), let us dive deeper into the quotations from the movie that underline the marked division and discord between classes through the lens of Marxist theory. The societal rift is palpable when Tom Buchanan sneeringly addresses Gatsby as “Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\\". This dismissive attitude not only aims to belittle Gatsby but also serves as a gatekeeping mechanism to maintain distance between the established wealth of old money and the aspiring members of the new money echelon. It's a reinforcement of the idea that no amount of wealth can buy the heritage and status that come with being born into the aristocracy of America. Gatsby's response to this classist snub, though silent, is significant. He continues to pursue his dream with the hope that his amassed wealth can indeed translate into social acceptance. His parties, described by Nick as events where \\"the parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser,\\" are not just celebrations but strategic investments into Gatsby's social capital. They are Gatsby's way of displaying his economic power, in hopes of bridging the gap between himself and the old money elite. However, the futility of Gatsby's efforts is underscored in a conversation he has with Nick, wherein he reveals his background: “You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well...”. In this dialogue, Gatsby's acknowledgement of his humble beginnings to Nick illustrates the depth of his aspiration and also the magnitude of the social divide he is attempting to cross. This disclosure to Nick, a character who straddles both worlds but belongs fully to neither, serves as a poignant reminder of the immutable barriers erected by class distinctions. Moreover, Tom's interrogation of Gatsby’s educational background is a stark example of the elite's skepticism towards the legitimacy of new money’s cultural capital. When Gatsby admits to not being \\"exactly\\" an Oxford man, Tom's incredulous laughter, \\"Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford!\\" not only undermines Gatsby’s achievements but also invalidates his attempts to culturally align with the upper class. This scene acts as a microcosm of the broader societal dismissal and gatekeeping faced by those attempting to transcend their class origins. In addition, Daisy’s oscillation between Tom and Gatsby symbolizes the conflict between secure, inherited wealth and the precarious, self-made fortune. Her ultimate choice to remain with Tom reinforces the notion that the security and familiarity of old money hold more value in their social world than the uncertain potential of new wealth. Her decision, indirectly influenced by societal norms and pressures, underlines the harsh reality that the American Dream, as chased by Gatsby, is unattainable for those not born into privilege. Thus, through these interactions and dialogues, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" effectively critiques the classist underpinnings of the American Dream and exposes the capitalist system's role in perpetuating class divisions. It illustrates that in a society governed by capital, economic success does not equate to social mobility, and the barriers between classes remain insurmountable, underlined by Marx’s contention that class conflict is an inherent and defining characteristic of capitalist societies."},{"prompt":"make it longer with quotations from the transcript of the movie as a part of analysis. second, this part (refer to marxism, neo-marxism theory to strengthen this): Commodification of Life The commodification of relationships and emotions is vividly depicted through Gatsby’s lavish parties meant to attract Daisy’s attention, portraying a society where interpersonal connections are secondary to material wealth and status. Gatsby’s entire existence becomes a commodity; his identity, mansion, and parties are all constructs designed to win over Daisy, who herself is portrayed as a prize to be won. This concept resonates with Marx’s theory of commodification, where under capitalism, not only goods but also individual identities and relationships are commodified. Daisy’s comment on Gatsby’s shirts, “I’ve never seen such beautiful shirts before,” symbolizes this commodification, equating Gatsby’s worth with his possessions rather than his character.","completion":"Delving into the theme of Commodification of Life within \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), the dialogue and the narrative serve as foundational illustrations of Marxist theories on commodification and in turn, resonate with the Neo-Marxist critique of capitalism's reach into personal and emotional realms of human existence. From the outset, Gatsby’s lavish parties signal a clear intent to commodify social connections for personal gain. Nick Carraway describes these events: “The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser,” underscoring the superficiality that pervades Gatsby's world. These parties, ostensibly gatherings of joy and socialization, are in reality marketplaces where relationships are transactions, and emotions are commodities to be traded for social ascension. Gatsby's interaction with his guests is not driven by genuine connection but by his desire to use these social constructs as a ladder to escape his nouveau-riche status and be acknowledged by the old wealth elite. Gatsby’s dialogue, though often sparse, reveals his internal commodification of Daisy. He confesses to Nick, “She’s got to tell [Tom] she never loved him...and then we can go back to the start.” In Gatsby’s perception, Daisy’s love is a transaction that needs to be clarified, a deal to be closed to restore his perceived right to possess her completely. His relentless pursuit transforms Daisy, in his eyes, into an ultimate prize that signifies the culmination of American success – the attainment of a desirable object that epitomizes wealth, status, and accomplishment. This notion is further reflected in Daisy's awe of Gatsby’s material possessions, notably when she weeps over his pile of shirts, illustrating how Gatsby’s wealth and the things he owns become a direct measure of his value in her eyes. Moreover, the portrayal of Myrtle Wilson and her relationship with Tom Buchanan exemplifies the commodification of individuals based on their utility. Myrtle is presented as an object of desirability to Tom, valued not for her personhood but for her role as an escape from his dispassionate marriage. This dynamic is vividly highlighted when Nick narrates, “Tom’s got some woman in New York,” reducing Myrtle to a mere “woman” - a possession or commodity rather than a person with agency and dignity. The film, through these characters and their interactions, exemplifies Marx’s assertion that under capitalism, social relationships, and human values are subjected to commodification – reducing personal relations to economic transactions and human value to material worth. Through a Neo-Marxist lens, this goes beyond economic commodification to highlight a culture where capitalism has permeated personal identity and human relationships to such an extent that individuals commodify their selves and others to navigate the social landscape defined by capital. Gatsby's failed attempt to reclaim his past with Daisy through wealth and spectacle ultimately underscores the hollowness at the heart of the commodification of life. It reveals the tragedy of a world where genuine human connections are subordinated to the pursuit of material and status, a world where everything can be bought and sold, except, as Gatsby discovers, the past and true love. This narrative aligns with the Neo-Marxist critique of capitalism, emphasizing the loss of human essence in the face of commodified relationships and identities."},{"prompt":"при запуске nginx выдает ошибку error code","completion":"Ошибка \\"error code\\" в nginx без конкретного описания или номера ошибки делает поиск решения сложным, так как причин может быть множество. Однако, есть несколько общих шагов, которые можно предпринять, чтобы попытаться исправить эту проблему или хотя бы уточнить её: 1. **Проверьте логи nginx**: Ошибка должна быть залогирована в файле ошибок nginx. По умолчанию, лог ошибок находится в \`/var/log/nginx/error.log\` (путь может отличаться в зависимости от вашей операционной системы или конфигурации). Посмотрите последние строки лога на предмет конкретных сообщений об ошибке, которые могут указывать на причину проблемы. 2. **Проверьте конфигурационный файл nginx**: Ошибка могла возникнуть из-за проблемы в конфигурации. Выполните команду \`nginx -t\` или \`nginx -T\` (для более подробного вывода), чтобы проверить синтаксис и убедиться, что нет ошибок. Система должна выдать сообщение либо о том, что конфигурация в порядке, либо указать на конкретные строки и файлы, где обнаружены ошибки. 3. **Проверьте наличие дубликатов настроек**: Иногда проблема может возникать из-за дублирования настроек, таких как двойное объявление порта в разных конфигурационных файлах. Убедитесь, что вы не прописали одни и те же настройки в разных местах. 4. **Проверьте порты**: Если ошибка связана с сетью, убедитесь, что порт, который вы пытаетесь использовать для nginx, не занят другим процессом. Вы можете использовать команду \`sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :80\` (замените 80 на нужный вам порт), чтобы проверить, занят ли порт. 5. **Перезапуск nginx**: После исправления проблемы с конфигурацией или других возможных причин проблемы попробуйте перезапустить nginx с помощью команды \`sudo systemctl restart nginx\` на системах с systemd или \`sudo service nginx restart\` на других системах. 6. **Обращение за помощью**: Если ни один из вышеперечисленных методов не сработал, вероятно, вам потребуется более конкретная помощь. Рассмотрите возможность обращения на форумы, посвященные nginx или Linux, где вы сможете предоставить конкретные логи ошибок и получить более целенаправленные советы. Помните, что очень важно предоставить как можно больше контекста и информации об ошибке, если вы обращаетесь за помощью в сообществах или форумах. Это включает версии софта, операционной системы, конкретные сообщения об ошибках и выдержки из конфигурационных файлов (с замазанными чувствительными данными)."},{"prompt":"не запускается nginx командой systemctl enable nginx","completion":"Если Nginx не запускается с помощью команды \`systemctl enable nginx\`, это может указывать на несколько возможных проблем. Стоит иметь в виду, что команда \`systemctl enable nginx\` предназначена не для запуска службы, а для её включения в автоматическую загрузку при старте системы. Для запуска службы используется команда \`systemctl start nginx\`. Вот несколько шагов, которые помогут выявить и решить проблему: 1. **Проверьте состояние nginx**: Прежде всего, убедитесь, что проблема действительно существует. Попробуйте запустить Nginx командой \`sudo systemctl start nginx\`, а затем проверьте статус службы командой \`sudo systemctl status nginx\`. Это покажет, активен ли Nginx и работает ли он корректно. 2. **Используйте команды в правильном порядке**: - Сначала включите автоматическую загрузку при старте системы: \`sudo systemctl enable nginx\` - Затем запустите Nginx: \`sudo systemctl start nginx\` 3. **Проверьте журналы на наличие ошибок**: - Посмотрите логи Nginx (например, \`/var/log/nginx/error.log\`), чтобы найти возможные сообщения об ошибках. - Проверьте системные журналы, использовав команду \`journalctl -u nginx\`. Это может предоставить подсказки о том, почему Nginx не смог запуститься. 4. **Проверьте конфигурацию Nginx**: - Убедитесь, что синтаксис конфигурационного файла корректен, используя команду \`sudo nginx -t\`. Это проверит конфигурацию на наличие синтаксических ошибок и предупредит вас, если найдет что-либо неправильное. 5. **Проверьте, не занят ли порт**: - Если вы используете стандартный порт (80 для HTTP или 443 для HTTPS), убедитесь, что другой процесс не использует эти порты. Это можно проверить, используя команду \`sudo netstat -tuln | grep :80\` или изменяя \`80\` на любой другой порт, который вы пытаетесь использовать. 6. **Проверьте права доступа**: - Убедитесь, что у вас есть соответствующие права для чтения конфигурационных файлов и доступа к соответствующим путям. Некорректные разрешения могут препятствовать успешному запуску Nginx. 7. **Перезагрузите systemd**: - Если вы недавно установили или обновили Nginx, может потребоваться перезагрузить демон systemd, чтобы он заново прочитал все измененные юнит-файлы. Это можно сделать командой \`sudo systemctl daemon-reload\`. После этого повторите попытку включения и запуска Nginx. 8. **Перезапуск системы**: - Если ничего не помогает, попробуйте перезагрузить ваш сервер или компьютер. Иногда перезагрузка может решить проблему, особенно если произошли изменения в системных настройках или установлены новые обновления, которые не вступили в силу. Если проблема не решена после выполнения вышеперечисленных шагов, рекомендую искать конкретное сообщение об ошибке в логах или статусе службы и искать решение с учетом этой информации."},{"prompt":"today i create a patreon page. on my page i will share my ai genareated Anime/Hentai NSFW stuff. so i need BIO for my patreon. can u create for me a bio","completion":"Sure!

Esto significa que una computadora cuántica puede procesar una cantidad enorme de información de forma simultánea, lo que le permite realizar cálculos y resolver problemas de manera mucho más eficiente que una computadora clásica. Además, también puede aprovechar el fenómeno de la superposición y el entrelazamiento cuántico para realizar operaciones más complejas y rápidas. Sin embargo, las computadoras cuánticas todavía están en una etapa experimental y tienen muchos desafíos técnicos por delante, como el control y la corrección de errores cuánticos.

However, a particular pond, nestled like a sparkling jewel amid the greenery, was about to become the stage for a moment both comedic and curiously endearing. Enter our protagonist, a Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army, known by his companions for both his valor in battle and his uncanny ability to lighten the dreariest of moods. This morning, he sought the secluded pond for a much-needed, albeit unconventional, bath. Stripping down to his very essence, he revealed a physique that was both a testament to his Scottish heritage and the rigorous demands of military life. Muscles honed by endless drills and marches played under his fair, freckle-dotted skin, gleaming like polished bronze in the dappled sunlight that broke through the canopy above. His hair, a wild cascade of fiery-red, partially tamed into a rough ponytail, had a rebellious few strands curling around his broad shoulders, catching the morning light as if ablaze. Yet, it was perhaps the sight of his posterior, as he waded waist-deep into the crystal waters, that would remain etched in the minds of any unsuspecting voyeur. Firm and unyielding, it was a fitting testament to the countless miles marched and the burdens borne across rugged terrains, a nod to his Highland strength and resilience. Midway in his ablutions, the Grenadier paused, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. He glanced over his shoulder, ensuring solitude, then positioned himself strategically, determined to embrace the day with the same fervor with which he faced his adversaries. With a concerted effort that engaged his formidable physique, he released into the water what could only be described as a monumental fart, his expression a delightful mix of concentration and glee. \\"Ah, lads, if only ye could witnessthis!\\" he chuckled to himself, watching as the pond's serene surface was momentarily disturbed by bubbles emerging in a hasty retreat from their source. No sooner had the ripples spread than a few unfortunate fish surfaced, their demise evidently hastened by the potent brew of the Highlander's making. \\"Blimey, I knew I was full of hot air, but to think I'd turn fisherman wit’ nothing but me arse!\\" he exclaimed with a hearty laugh, the sound echoing through the trees, startling a flock of birds into flight. As he continued his bath, he mused aloud, \\"I wager these waters haven't seen the likes of such a spectacle since we Scots learned to swim by outpacing Nessie herself. Perhaps this will start a new legend, eh? The mysterious beast of the pond, terrorizing fish with naught but its stench!\\" His laughter mingled with the natural chorus of the forest as he finished his unconventional bath, stepping from the pond refreshed, not just in body but in spirit. \\"A battle might wait on the morrow, but today, I’ve conquered the pond in my own, indelible way,\\" he quipped, a grin spreading across his features as he donned his uniform once again, ready to face whatever the day might bring with the same unyielding audacity. And so, the tale of the Highlander Grenadier and his peculiar method of fishing would weave itself into the fabric of the unit's lore, recounted around campfires and in taverns, a mirthful memory of a moment caught between the struggles of war and the enduring resilience of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"in this js code how to access state from event listener class Game { this.state = { x: 0 }","completion":"The snippet you've provided doesn't represent valid JavaScript syntax for class definition or adding event listeners. However, I'll guide you through a correct approach to define a class, set an initial state, and access that state from an event listener. First, ensure to properly define your class properties inside a constructor and use methods to incorporate behaviors, including setting up event listeners. For instance: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { x: 0 }; // Bind the this context for the event handler if you plan to use 'this' inside the handler this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); } // Method to increase x in the state incrementX() { this.state.x += 1; console.log(this.state.x); } // Handle click event handleClick() { // Access state directly since 'this' is bound to the instance this.incrementX(); } // Method to set up an event listener setupEventListener() { // For example, setting up a click event listener on the document body // Ensure this.handleClick has the Game instance context document.body.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick); } } // Create an instance of the Game class const myGame = new Game(); // Setup the event listener for the instance myGame.setupEventListener(); \`\`\` In this example: 1. A new \`Game\` class is defined with a constructor initializing the state with \`{ x: 0 }\`. 2. A method \`incrementX\` is created to modify the state property \`x\`. 3. Another method, \`handleClick\`, is defined as an event handler that will call \`incrementX\` upon being triggered, such as on a click. This demonstrates how to access and modify the state inside an event handler. 4. The \`setupEventListener\` method adds a click event listener to the document's body, using \`handleClick\` as the callback. By previously binding \`this.handleClick\` in the constructor, it ensures the context of \`this\` within \`handleClick\` refers to the \`Game\` instance, thus allowing access to \`this.state\` and any other properties or methods. This setup performs a crucial step needed in class-based event handlers in JavaScript: the use of \`.bind(this)\` to ensure the callback function retains the correct context for \`this\`. Without it, \`this\` inside your callback refers to the object that triggered the event (for instance, \`document.body\` if the event listener was attached there), not the class instance, and you would not be able to access the state directly."},{"prompt":"is primarily involved in the coordination of somatic motor functions, which means principally skeletal muscle contractions.target 9 of 11 Blank is a complex structure composed of multiple nuclei.

In the context of the event listener function, \`this\` does not refer to the instance of the class but rather to the element that the event listener was attached to. To access \`state\` from within the event listener, you need to ensure the function has the correct reference to \`this\`—the instance of the class. There are a few different ways to handle this. One common approach is to use an arrow function since arrow functions do not have their own \`this\` and inherit \`this\` from the surrounding lexical context. Another approach is to bind the function explicitly to \`this\` using \`bind()\`. Here's how you could adjust your class to make it work with an arrow function: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { phase: \\"aiming\\", }; // Assuming bombGrabAreaDOM is accessible and defined bombGrabAreaDOM.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", (e) => { // Arrow function inherits \`this\` from the constructor console.log(this.state.phase); // You can access state here }); } } \`\`\` And here's how you could do it with \`bind()\`: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { phase: \\"aiming\\", }; // Explicitly bind \`this\` to the function bombGrabAreaDOM.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", this.handleMouseDown.bind(this)); } handleMouseDown(e) { console.log(this.state.phase); // You can access state here } } \`\`\` Note, for the examples above to work, \`bombGrabAreaDOM\` must be defined and accessible. You could define it outside the class, pass it to the class constructor, or query it inside the constructor. For instance, if \`bombGrabAreaDOM\` is an element in the DOM with a unique ID, you can query it inside the constructor like this: \`\`\`javascript class Game { constructor() { this.state = { phase: \\"aiming\\", }; const bombGrabAreaDOM = document.getElementById(\\"yourElementId\\"); bombGrabAreaDOM.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", (e) => { console.log(this.state.phase); }); } } \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`\\"yourElementId\\"\` with the actual ID of the element you wish to attach the event listener to."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The international stage was set ablaze with hostilities, particularly focusing its inferno in the volcanic regions of Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. **2035:** This year heralded the ominous expansion of aggressive postures into open hostilities, the seeds of which were unwittingly sown to grow into the ultimate conflagration of human conflict, a war that would, in grim irony, herald an end to all wars on the earthly plane. **2037:** The world was thrust into the throes of World War III, a sprawling chessboard of strife that saw knights and pawns clash from the icy ramparts of Alaska to the desolate, mine-strewn deserts of the Sahara. The globe became an arena for the symphony of war, its movements chaotic and its harmony discordant. **2042 (The Year of Nuclear Fire):** Amidst the cacophony of continuous warfare, a dare long dangled by North Korea was finally fulfilled. Decades of nuclear brinkmanship culminated in a devastating reality, as London, Washington D.C., Tokyo, and other major cities worldwide were swallowed by a voracious inferno of atomic wrath. **2042 (Retaliation Unleashed):** The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pushed to the brink of despair, unleashed its own arsenal of nuclear wrath upon key strategic and civilian locales deemed enemy strongholds. This catastrophic exchange of apocalyptic might cleaved the human population by nearly half, an unimaginable culling by fire and fury. **2044 (The Scourge Unearthed):** As if the nuclear armageddon was not sufficient retribution against humanity's hubris, a new specter of death emerged in the form of a relentless plague. With its incurably devastating effects and a resilience that mocked all attempts at containment, the scourge seemed to spell the final chapter for human civilization. **2050:** By the grim dawn of 2050, the Earth's population, once a testament to human prosperity and growth in 2038, was now a shadow of its former self. Less than a third of mankind remained, the rest having been claimed by war, disease, and the natural attrition of a world unconcerned with human plight. **2054 (The Fractured Armistice):** Amid the desolation and ruin, the fragmented remnants of nations and factions, driven by desperation and the stark realization of their impending extinction, forged a precarious detente. This truce, born of necessity, was a faint glimmer of hope in the shadow of annihilation. **[The Ascension of Desperation]** **2055:** Out of the ashes of despair, an unexpected phoenix arose. Humanity, faced with its own mortality and the shattered remnants of its world, turned once again to the divine. The period marked the birth of the \\"doomspires,\\" monumental edifices constructed from multi-hued bricks. These towering temples, stretching towards the heavens, were a plea to Blox, a beacon of hope in a world devoid of it. **[The Silence Before the Storm]** **[No records survive from 2055 until the dawn of 2099.]** In this era of unrecorded history, humanity perhaps waged its greatest battle, not against each other, but for survival against the very consequences of their former hubris.

Angus was a peculiar sight in these woods, a tower of a man with hair red as the fieriest sunset, cascading down his broad shoulders in wild, untamed waves. His physique, a testament to the harsh training and Highland life, was a mixture of brawn and sheer brute strength, sculpted by years of wielding his musket and the heavy grenadier bearskin cap that now lay discarded on the grassy bank, far from the water's edge where Angus ventured for a much-needed wash. Wading waist-deep into the cool embrace of a secluded pond, Angus was in his element, free from the constrictions of his uniform and the war that seemed a world away. The water, a refreshing respite, lapped against his sun-kissed skin, marked by the occasional battle scar. As the sunlight pierced through the canopy, it illuminated his form, casting a heroic yet comical silhouette. Focussing on the task at hand, Angus began a thorough scrub, his strong hands working to dislodge the grime of battle and march. Suddenly, feeling a gaseous bubble brewing from within, Angus, with a mischievous glint in his eye, remarked to himself, \\"Ready yerselves, lads, for a blast that'll rival the cannons of Lexington!\\" With a cheeky grin, he positioned himself, leaning slightly forward for maximum effect, and released a mighty fart into the pond. The resulting bubbles rushed to the surface, carrying with them a few unlucky fish that were rendered lifeless from the odorous assault. Angus, unabashed and quite pleased with his aquatic achievements, bellowed with laughter, his echoes filling the forest around him. \\"Oh, what’s this? Dinner served by the very cheeks that would scare off the British!\\" Angus amused himself with the sight, his rear now immortalized in the annals of unconventional fishing methods. Inspecting the floating fish, Angus debated his culinary options. \\"Do I dare dine on the fruits of me own...eruption? Aye, waste not, want not, as Ma used to say.\\" With a shrug, he waded out of the pond, his physique glistening and every bit the image of a rugged yet oddly endearing warrior. As he set about preparing his impromptu meal, Angus couldn't help but chuckle at the day's turn of events. \\"Who would've thought the mighty Angus MacFergus, feared by men, would be brought to cooking fish felled by naught but the power of his own backside?\\" Cooking over a makeshift fire, the aroma of grilled fish filled the air, a stark contrast to the earlier scent that dominated the pond. Angus took a hearty bite, his taste buds dancing to the flavors of his unusual catch. \\"Ah, not bad at all! Perhaps I've found me a new calling. Angus MacFergus: the first grenadier gourmand!\\" As night fell, Angus, satiated and content, looked up at the stars, his laughter mingling with the crackling of the fire. In the heart of colonial America, amidst the upheaval and chaos, a lone Highlander had found a moment of joy and absurdity, a tale that would surely baffle and entertain for generations to come. And so, the legend of Angus \\"The Fartriotic Chef\\" MacFergus was born, a story of resilience, resourcefulness, and the inexplicable ways of warfare and wind."},{"prompt":"For a board game based of Hl2, detail the abilities and stats of each character piece.","completion":"Creating a board game based on Half-Life 2 (HL2) offers a rich palette of characters and lore to draw from.

To use character abilities in the Half-Life 2 board game concept, you can incorporate various real-life actions such as decision-making, strategic planning, and physical tasks or challenges. Here's how you might implement the abilities mentioned earlier: # 1. **Gordon Freeman** - **Crowbar Swing:** Players could have a set of \\"Action Cards\\" they draw from, with some being crowbar attacks. They must decide when to play these cards optimally, adding a strategy element. - **Gravity Gun Use:** This could involve a mini-game where players must quickly solve a puzzle (like a simple match-3 on a card) to successfully use the Gravity Gun. # 2. **Alyx Vance** - **Hacking:** This might require players to complete a quick logic puzzle or decode a simple cipher within a time limit to simulate hacking. - **Precision Shot:** Players could use a token to mark a target on the board. Successfully landing the shot could involve rolling a specific number or higher on a die, reflecting Alyx's sharpshooting skills. # 3. **Barney Calhoun** - **Undercover:** Players could choose to deploy an \\"Undercover\\" card that allows them to move through enemy territories without engagement, but they must first answer a lore question correctly or forfeit the move. - **Crowbar Combat:** Similar to Gordon's Crowbar Swing, but perhaps Barney's version requires players to trade in a resource, reflecting his need to be more resourceful. # 4. **Dr. Isaac Kleiner** - **Scientific Insight:** Players could be allowed to consult a special hint or guidebook once per game or session, simulating Kleiner's advice. - **Teleport:** This could involve placing a teleport token on the board. When a player decides to teleport, they must spin a \\"teleport spinner\\" to determine their new location, adding an element of chance. # 5. **Dog** - **Heavy Lift:** Players may have to successfully complete a physical task (e.g., stacking a certain number of tokens within a time limit) to mimic Dog's strength in moving obstacles. - **Protective Protocol:** When another player is under attack, the Dog's controller might have the option to block the attack using a special \\"Protector\\" card, limited to once every few turns. # 6. **The Combine Soldier** - **Suppression Fire:** The player could deploy a token that limits movement for other players. Others must roll a die, and only on a high enough roll can they move freely, simulating the suppression effect. - **Enhanced Armor:** This could be as simple as adding a persistent bonus to the soldier's defense stats, reducing incoming damage by a constant factor. # 7. **Headcrab Zombie** - **Infect:** When attacking, the player might place an \\"Infect\\" token on another character. This could impose a penalty or require the infected player to complete a challenge to remove the token. - **Swarm:** This could be represented by allowing the Headcrab Zombie's attack strength to increase for each additional Zombie or Infect token near the target, requiring players to decide strategically when to group their zombies. These real-life actions incorporate a mix of strategic choice, physical dexterity, and knowledge challenges to make the board game immersive and engaging, mirroring the complexity and excitement of Half-Life 2's gameplay."},{"prompt":"Gostaris de abordar em um texto o tema tecnologias aplicadas no mundo do vinho","completion":"A indústria vinícola, com suas tradições milenares, está se transformando rapidamente sob o impacto das novas tecnologias.

However, since there's a need for an additional step to convert operands and operators into a \`named_expr\`, and then into prefix tokens without using direct recursion, this becomes a trickier scenario under the given constraints. Based on this, the solution can only be implied conceptually within those rules because direct implementation requires careful crafting beyond typical usage scenarios, especially without recursion or direct calls to structures parse \`op_expr\` format. However, let's conceptualize a solution pathway assuming there exists a way to translate \`op_expr\` forms into \`named_expr\` without breaking the constraints given, starting with leveraging \`named_to_op_expr/2\` and \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`: 1. **Convert \`op_expr\` to \`named_expr\`:** This step would involve translating \`+(A, B)\` into \`add(A, B)\` and \`*(A, B)\` into \`mul(A, B)\`. Considering the constraints, there's a need for an intermediary representation or strategy to bridge this without direct use of recursion. 2. **Use \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` for the conversion to prefix tokens:** Once in \`named_expr\` format, the existing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` can be employed to produce the intended prefix notation tokens list. Creating this intermediary step defies the simple resolution path given the \\"no recursion and no Prolog built-ins\\" rules. In actual implementation within these boundaries, a creative workaround is crucial. One theoretically possible method could involve dynamically rewriting expressions into a format that can be indirectly processed by \`named_to_op_expr/2\` (in reverse usage or logically implied manner) and then passed to \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. However, considering the direct solution isn't provided, and the challenging nature of these restrictions, the ideal method would involve revisiting the constraints to allow minimal logical recursion or controlled usage of built-ins for parsing, thus facilitating a more straightforward and feasible pathway to solution under Prolog's declarative paradigm. Given this, no direct implementation is provided here, but rather a conceptual pathway suggesting a complex multi-step conversion process necessary under the restrictive conditions posed."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in colonial America of a Highlander Grenadier in the Continental Army washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

On this particular day, as the sun rode high in the azure heavens, the serene stillness of nature was about to be comically disturbed by the exploits of Angus McFadden, a Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army with a reputation for mischief as grand as the Highlands themselves. Angus, a towering figure of a man, with the sort of brawn sculpted not in the gymnasiums of the modern age but in the harsh and unforgiving gyms of life and warfare, had decided it was time for a bath. Not one for modesty, he stripped down in the buff, revealing a physique that was a testament to his Scottish roots and the physical demands of his role. His hair, a fiery cascade of red, flowed down his back, catching the sunlight and almost sparkling with a life of its own. As he waded waist-deep into the reflective surface of the pond, Angus took a moment to revel in the cooling embrace of the water, letting out a contented sigh that seemed to say, \\"Aye, this is the life.\\" Unbeknownst to most, Angus had a cheeky side that often saw the light of day in the most unexpected moments. Finding himself alone in the bosom of nature, Angus decided it was the perfect moment to partake in one of life's simplest pleasures—a hearty fart. With a mischievous grin stretching across his rugged features, he squatted slightly, bracing himself against the gentle resistance of the water. The effort on his face was both comedic and slightly heroic, as if he were engaging in a battle only he could understand. Then, with the force of a small cannon, Angus let rip a fart that echoed off the surrounding trees with a reverberation that seemed to momentarily pause the natural order. As he stood to admire his handiwork, the resulting bubbles furiously ascended to the pond's surface, carrying with them a stench so potent that Angus himself couldn't help but chuckle, \\"Och, that'll slay more redcoats than my musket!\\" As the ripples of his endeavor dispersed, Angus noticed a few motionless fish floating belly-up, victims of his devastatingly potent gas. With a bemused twinkle in his eye, he said aloud to the deceased fish, \\"Apologies, lads. I didna mean to wage chemical warfare on ye.\\" The sight of the dead fish presented a dilemma; should he gather them for his supper? After scrutinizing them for a moment, Angus decided against it, reasoning with a hearty laugh, \\"Nae, I'll not have my dinner be something that succumbed to the might of my backside. That's no way for a warrior to meet his end.\\" With his cleaning and comedy concluded, Angus waded back to the shore, leaving the pond's tranquility forever altered by his presence. As he dressed, he couldn't resist one final jest, \\"Tales of my exploits shall spread across this land, from sea to shining sea. Let them speak of the day when Angus McFadden defeated the British and a school of innocent fish with naught but the power of his posterior!\\" And so, clad once more in his Grenadier uniform, Angus McFadden set off back to camp, leaving behind a story that would be whispered and chuckled over around campfires for many nights to come. The tale of the Highlander and his lethal gas would quickly become the stuff of legend, a humorous anecdote in the saga of America's birth, demonstrating that even in times of strife, humanity's ability to find humor in the absurdity of life remains undiminished."},{"prompt":"Software Restriction Policies","completion":"Software Restriction Policies (SRP) are a set of rules and configurations that can be implemented on a Windows operating system to control which software programs can be run on a computer.

Angus McFart, as legend had it, was a man of considerable stature, with hair as wild as the untamed forests that sprawled across the newborn nation. His locks, a fiery red cascade, tumbled down his broad shoulders, catching sunlight and turning it into a spectacle of gleaming copper. From beneath rugged brows, his blue eyes sparkled with mirth, a stark contrast to his fearsome appearance. Angus was built like the highlands he hailed from—towering and imposing with muscles honed by battle and the rugged life of a soldier. His rear, much like the rest of him, was as firm and round as the cannonballs he lobbed at the British, a fact that he was oddly proud of. One warm afternoon, amidst the ongoing tussle for freedom, Angus decided to partake in a rather primitive yet deeply satisfying ritual—to cleanse himself in a secluded pond, away from the prying eyes and the stifling formalities of the army camp. Stripping down to his very essence, he left his garments on the bank and waded waist-deep into the clear waters, the cool embrace of nature washing over him. Hardened by battles and the harsh Highland environment, his skin bore the tales of countless skirmishes—yet in this moment, he was but a man, indulging in life’s simpler pleasures. As Angus began to scrub the grime of warfare from his body, a wicked idea took form. His diet, a robust concoction of beans, meats, and whatever else could be foraged or afforded, had brewed a storm within his belly—a storm that now sought release. Positioning himself with a gleeful grin, he flexed his might and let out a formidable fart, the sound echoing through the trees like the call of a wild beast. \\"Heh, take that, ya blasted redcoats!\\" he chortled, the ripples carrying his battle cry across the pond. To his amusement, the act wasn’t without consequence. A few moments later, the surface of the pond betrayed the presence of unintended casualties—dead fish, floating belly-up, victims of the potent stench that had erupted from Angus's nether regions. \\"Blimey,\\" Angus exclaimed, scratching his head as he regarded the floating fish. \\"Didn’ mean to start me own rebellion in the pond, but a man’s gotta eat, aye?\\" Contemplating the sight, Angus deliberated the practicalities of waste not, want not. \\"Well, look at that, nature’s providence! Saved me the trouble of fishin’, didn' it?\\" he mused aloud, the corners of his mouth twitching into a smirk. With a shrug of his broad shoulders, succumbing to the pragmatic side of a soldier's life, he decided to salvage the fish for his dinner. \\"McFart’s catch of the day, served fresh! Hah, if this soldierin’ business goes awry, I reckon I’d make a fine fisherman, suffocatin’ the sea with nothing but the power of me arse!\\" Angus laughed heartily at the thought, his laughter mingling with the sounds of the wilderness. Gathering the fish with a certain efficiency, he emerged from the pond, his physique glistening under the sun, a testament to the raw force and vitality of a man who, despite the tumultuous times, found moments of amusement and joy. As he dressed, slipping into his uniform, a sense of satisfaction filled him—not just for the meal secured in such an unconventional manner, but for the reminder that even in the direst of circumstances, life offered opportunities for laughter and levity. \\"Tonight, me lads will dine on the finest fare, courtesy of Angus’s arse. May it be as victorious over hunger as we are over tyranny!\\" Angus declared, a wide grin plastered across his face as he made his way back to camp, the dead fish in tow and a tale that would soon become legend among the ranks of the Continental Army. Thus, in the heart of colonial America, amidst the turmoil and the striving for a nation's birthright, Angus McFart, Highlander Grenadier, fashioned a moment of comedic relief—a reminder that freedom, in all its facets, includes the liberty to laugh, even if it's at one's own posterior exploits."},{"prompt":"I have an interview for a project assistant posion in an international NGO in syria what questions should I prepare myself for?","completion":"When preparing for an interview as a Project Assistant in an international NGO, especially in a complex and sensitive environment like Syria, it's crucial to anticipate a range of questions.

Not just any pond, mind you, but one that was about to bear witness to an event that would go unrecorded in the annals of history, yet would be worthy of folklore had the fishes been able to speak—and survive. Amidst this idyllic setting, a Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army, by the name of Angus MacBubble, decided it was high time for a bath. Angus was a sight to behold: his thick, fiery red hair cascaded down his broad shoulders like lava flowing down a mountain, albeit with a somewhat more graceful descent. His physique was that of a man who wielded muskets like twigs and charged into battle with the ferocity of a Highland storm. And his butt, oh, that was a masterpiece sculpted by the rigorous drills and endless marches; it was as if two perfectly rounded boulders had decided to settle down and make their home beneath his kilt. On this particular day, Angus waded into the pond, casting aside his garments with the nonchalance of a man at one with nature. As he dipped waist-deep into the cool embrace of the water, he began the sacred ritual of scrubbing the grime of war from his well-earned muscles. The serene environment, coupled with the soothing effect of the water, inspired a moment of relaxation in Angus. Feeling a bubbling sensation in his stomach, he grinned, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. \\"Ah, be ready, ye water spirits,\\" he chuckled to himself, placing his hands on his firm hips and pushing out his chest with pride. \\"Angus MacBubble is about to grant thee the honor of hosting the Highland Air Symphony!\\" With that, he leaned slightly to one side, squinting his eyes and pursing his lips in concentration. A moment of silence ensued, and then, with the effort of a man squeezing the last drop of water from a stone, he released a fart into the pond. The water around him rippled and bubbled as if a tiny underwater volcano had just erupted. Angus stood there, a proud, almost regal figure, as he inhaled deeply, savoring the aroma of his own creation. \\"Aye, now that’s the scent of the Highlands,\\" he proclaimed with a satisfied grin, ignoring the fact that the Highlands smelled nothing like the noxious gas he'd just released. As the ripples faded, a curious sight caught his eye: a few dead fish floated to the surface, their lifeless eyes staring up as if in shock at the lethal weapon they had just encountered. Angus scratched his head, pondering the sight before him. \\"Well, now, didn’t expect to be catchin' dinner with me arse,\\" he mused, his Scottish brogue thick with amusement. \\"But a warrior takes his meals where he can.\\" As he plucked the deceased fish from the water, examining them as though they were treasures bestowed upon him by the pond itself, he continued to speak, \\"Ach, don’t ye worry, my aquatic friends. Ye have not died in vain. Tonight, ye shall feast in the great halls of Valhalla, or whatever bonny place fish go when they meet their maker, courtesy of Angus MacBubble’s mighty wind.\\" Gathering the fish, Angus prepared to leave the pond, refreshed and now laden with an unexpected bounty. \\"This tale,\\" he said to himself as he dried off and began to dress, \\"will be one for the ages. 'The day Angus MacBubble fished with naught but his arse'—aye, that’ll light up the faces around the campfire.\\" And so, our Highlander Grenadier, clothed once more and with dinner in hand, strode back to camp, leaving behind a slightly less pure pond, but a story that, unfortunately for the fish, would never be fully appreciated by their kind."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in colonial America of a Highlander Grenadier in the Continental Army washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

The protagonist of our tale: Angus McFartnblast, a towering Highlander Grenadier of the Continental Army, known across the colonies not just for his prowess on the battlefield but for his, let’s say, uniquely potent bodily emanations. Angus, with his mane of fiery red hair cascading down his broad, freckled back, wades waist-deep into the cool, serene waters. His physique, a spectacle of raw, muscular power sculpted through years of war and hardship, moves with an almost majestic grace. A stark contrast to the peaceful morning vista. Despite his formidability, it’s his posterior that truly stands out—a pair of cheeks as proud and formidable as the highlands from whence he came. This particular morning, Angus sought the tranquility of the pond not for reflection or meditation, but for a bath, one that was long overdue. Stripping down to his birthday suit, he confidently strides into the water, the coolness of the dawn doing little to chill his warm, hearty Scottish spirit. As he begins to scrub and cleanse himself, with makeshift soap fashioned from the land, a mischievous grin crosses his face. The serene silence is suddenly pierced by Angus attempting to muster what can only be described as a symphonic expulsion of gas. He squats slightly, his face turning a shade of crimson that rivals his hair, exerting himself with such enthusiasm that even the nearby flora seemed to lean in with anticipation. Finally, with a triumphant and resounding gurgle, the deed is done. A bubble train of considerable length and girth makes its way to the pond’s surface, breaking the stillness with a series of jubilant pops. “Ah, ain’t that a beauty!” Angus declares with a hearty, self-congratulatory laugh, inhaling deeply and savoring the aroma with an almost connoisseur-like appreciation. “Smells like the highlands after a heavy rain, it does!” But then, a ghastly consequence unfolds. To Angus’s disbelief, several fish float to the surface, victims of the toxic cloud he had just released. The sight would be comical if it weren’t so absurd. Eyes wide, Angus can’t help but reflect on his deadly potency. “Och, Laddie, didn’t mean to start a wee massacre,” he chuckles to himself, feeling a twinge of guilt for the unintended carnage. After a moment of contemplation, an idea dawns on him. “Waste not, want not, as me Ma’ used to say,” Angus muses, pondering the practicality of the situation. With skilled hands, he gathers the unfortunate fish, deciding that they would make a fine dinner. “A feast courtesy of me arse, who’d have thought?” Returning to shore, Angus dresses, slipping into his Grenadier garb with a sense of purpose and satisfaction. The silhouette of the sun now rising higher, casting a golden glow that illuminates the pond and the scene of this peculiar feast-to-be. “A tale for the ages, this’ll be,” Angus chuckles, imagining the look on his comrades' faces when he recounts the story of how he felled fish with nothing but the might of his bowels. “Angus McFartnblast, the only Scotsman to conquer with both sword and scent!” Thus, with his spoils in hand and a tale that would indeed echo through the annals of colonial humor, Angus set off, leaving behind a pond forever changed and a story that would be recounted around campfires and taverns alike, in whispered tones of disbelief and riotous laughter."},{"prompt":"#!/usr/bin/env -S swipl %-- mode: prolog;

Although most of the functions are correctly implemented and tested, the \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` function is marked as 'TODO', indicating it hasn't been implemented yet. To complete the implementation for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`, let’s break down the requirements and constraints: 1. The function should convert an expression involving integers, '+', and '*' into a list of tokens in prefix notation. 2. The implementation must use only earlier procedures, explicitly disallowing direct recursion or Prolog built-ins that might simplify this task directly. Given these constraints, a direct implementation within these bounds might not be straightforward since this function seems to require analyzing potentially deeply nested structures (like \`+(1, +(2, 3))\`) and converting them into a corresponding list in prefix notation (\`[+, 1, +, 2, 3]\`). However, I’ll sketch a theoretical approach based on the constraints and your existing infrastructure: 1. **Leverage Previous Implementations**: The \`named_to_op_expr/2\` and \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` predicates already do a significant amount of work that resembles what \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` needs. 2. **Transformation Approach**: - Convert the input op expression to a named expression format that \`named_to_op_expr/2\` can understand. For example, transforming \`+(1, 2)\` to \`add(1, 2)\`. - Use \`named_to_op_expr/2\` to convert the new named expression to an operation expression if needed or pass directly to \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. - \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` already generates a prefix notation, but tuned for your \`'add'\` and \`'mul'\` tags instead of the operational symbols \`'+'\` and \`'*'\`. **Important Note:** Directly implementing a conversion that just wraps or mimics the built-in parse and token generation for arithmetic expressions without using recursion or built-ins contradictorily challenges the problem statement. A true solution would likely require either a relaxation of the \\"no recursion\\" constraint to manually parse and convert the expression tree or a clever workaround that technically adheres to the rules while effectively bending them (e.g., exploiting Prolog's pattern-matching capabilities in a recursive manner that mimics iteration). Because of these constraints and without additional specific tools or previously established \\"helper\\" predicates tailored for direct expression parsing within these constraints, crafting a full, functional \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` under these conditions is a complex task. It's a conceptual challenge aimed at testing the limits of what's achievable with Prolog's pattern matching and recursion capabilities within a tightly constrained framework. For actual usage, one might consider relaxing the constraints to directly implement the needed logic or reevaluating the necessity of such constraints against the task requirements."},{"prompt":"Переведи Omnifactory на русской.

On this peculiar day, Angus decided a bath was in order, having fought both the British and a rather regrettable stench emanating from his person. \\"Aye, time to wash away the sins o' battle... and the smells,\\" he muttered to himself, stepping into a secluded pond in nothing but his birthday suit. The water greeted him with a refreshing embrace, a stark contrast to the bloody melee of war. Floating waist-deep, he sighed, relishing the serenity of nature uninterrupted—save for his own presence, of course. Now, Angus had a special talent. Not only could he wield a bayonet with terrifying precision, but he could also produce flatulence with such force it could rival the sound of cannon fire. Feeling a particular pressure building within, he grinned, \\"Let's give these colonial waters a taste of the Highlands.\\" With effort that could be described as nothing short of Herculean, Angus hunched slightly, face turning a shade of crimson that matched his hair, and released a fart into the pond with such gusto it created bubbles that cascaded around him like a fizzy aura. \\"Ah, the sweet scent of freedom!\\" he exclaimed, inhaling deeply with an almost reverent expression. The water around him seemed to shimmer, or perhaps it quivered in fear, as a few moments passed in silent homage to his deed. Then, an unexpected audience made itself known. Several fish, unfortunate enough to have been in the direct path of Angus's natural weapon, floated to the surface, clearly overcome by the potent stench. \\"Well, what do we have here?\\" Angus remarked, observing the fish with a curious eye. \\"Looks like the feast has presented itself, courtesy of me own backside!\\" He contemplated the situation, tapping a finger against his robust chin. \\"To dine, or not to dine—that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous stomach, or to take arms against a sea of fishes...\\" His voice trailed off, then he shrugged and scooped up the fish. \\"Eh, waste not, want not. The lads will be singing tales of this feast for years to come. The day Angus McFartnagle not only cleared the battlefield but also provided dinner with naught but the power of his arse.\\" With that, our Highlander hero waded out of the pond, not bothering to clothe his wet, glistening form just yet. He walked back to camp, fish in hand, ready to regale his comrades with the tale of his piscatorial conquest courtesy of a well-timed fart. And indeed, the legend of Angus McFartnagle—the man who could fell both man and fish with the sheer force of his wind—grew ever larger, echoing through the annals of Continental Army lore."},{"prompt":"ما هو العلاج السلوك المعرفي","completion":"العلاج السلوكي المعرفي (CBT) هو نوع من العلاج النفسي الذي يُستخدم لعلاج مجموعة واسعة من الاضطرابات النفسية، بما في ذلك الاكتئاب، القلق، الرهاب، اضطراب ما بعد الصدمة، اضطرابات الأكل، ومشكلات النوم مثل الأرق. يركز هذا النوع من العلاج على تغيير الأفكار والمعتقدات السلبية أو غير الواقعية التي تؤثر على الشخص وتحويلها إلى أفكار أكثر إيجابية وواقعية، مما يساعد على تحسين الحالة المزاجية والسلوك. العلاج السلوكي المعرفي يقوم على فكرة أساسية مفادها أن أفكارنا (المعرفة) ومشاعرنا وسلوكياتنا مرتبطة ببعضها البعض وأنه يمكن تغيير الشعور بالتحسن من خلال تغيير طريقة تفكيرنا وتصرفنا. يشمل العلاج استراتيجيات مثل: 1. **تحديد الأفكار السلبية**: يُعلم المعالج الشخص كيفية التعرف على أفكاره ومعتقداته السلبية. 2. **تحدي التفكير السلبي**: يُشجع الشخص على التحدي والتساؤل حول صحة هذه الأفكار واستبدالها بأخرى أكثر واقعية وإيجابية. 3. **تغيير السلوك**: يُساعد العلاج الشخص على تغيير السلوكيات التي قد تؤدي إلى تحسين مزاجه وحالته العامة. 4. **مهارات التأقلم**: يُعلم الشخص مهارات جديدة للتعامل مع التوتر والضغط النفسي. 5. **التعرض والوقاية من الاستجابة**: خاصة في حالة الرهاب والقلق الشديد، حيث يتم تعريض الشخص بشكل تدريجي وآمن للموقف أو الشيء الذي يخاف منه. عادةً ما يكون العلاج السلوكي المعرفي قصير الأمد وأكثر تركيزاً من أشكال العلاج النفسي الأخرى. يتم تصميمه لتزويد الأفراد بالأدوات والاستراتيجيات اللازمة لتغيير تفكيرهم وسلوكهم بطريقة تُسهم في تحسين نوعية حياتهم."},{"prompt":"هل يوجد نقاط تحفيزية للتركيز في المخ","completion":"في الحقيقة، مفهوم \\"نقاط تحفيزية للتركيز\\" في المخ قد يُوحي بوجود مناطق محددة يمكن استهدافها مباشرة لتحسين التركيز دون سواها. بينما لا يوجد \\"زر تركيز\\" محدد في المخ يمكن الضغط عليه، هناك عدة استراتيجيات وتمارين التي يمكن أن تساعد في تعزيز القدرة على التركيز والانتباه من خلال تحفيز أو تفعيل مناطق معيّنة في الدماغ. بعض من هذه الاستراتيجيات تشمل: 1. **ممارسة الرياضة**: النشاط البدني ينشط الدماغ ويحسن وظائفه الإدراكية، بما في ذلك التركيز. 2. **تقنيات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية (Mindfulness)**: التأمل يساعد في تحسين التركيز ويقلل من التشتت، كما يمكن أن يعزز من قدرة الدماغ على معالجة المعلومات. 3. **نظام غذائي متوازن**: تناول أطعمة تحتوي على أحماض أوميغا-3 الدهنية، الفيتامينات، والمعادن يمكن أن يسهم في تحسين وظائف الدماغ. 4. **تنظيم النوم**: الحصول على قسط كافٍ من النوم ليلاً يساعد في تحسين القدرة على التركيز والاحتفاظ بالمعلومات. 5. **تقليل التوتر**: التوتر المفرط يمكن أن يؤثر سلبًا على التركيز، لذا يفيد التحكم بمستويات التوتر. 6. **تمارين الدماغ**: ألغاز الكلمات، الألغاز، السودوكو، وغيرها من ألعاب التفكير يمكن أن تساعد في تقوية قدرات الدماغ. من الناحية العلمية، يمكن القول إن التركيز يعتمد على عمل متكامل بين مناطق مختلفة من الدماغ، بما في ذلك القشرة الجبهية (التي تلعب دوراً في التحكم والانتباه) والحُصين (المهم لتشكيل الذاكرة). عند ممارسة الأنشطة أو التمارين التي تحسن الصحة العقلية والجسدية، يمكن تعزيز تركيز الدماغ وقدراته الإدراكية بشكل عام."},{"prompt":"ما هى تقنيات التامل واليقظة الذهنية","completion":"تقنيات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية هي مجموعة من الممارسات التي تهدف إلى تحسين الوعي باللحظة الحالية، تقليل التوتر، وتعزيز الصحة العقلية والرفاهية العامة. هذه التقنيات تساعد الأشخاص على التركيز على الحاضر، بدلاً من القلق بشأن الماضي أو المستقبل. إليك بعض من أشهر تقنيات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية: 1. **تأمل التركيز**: - يركز الشخص على شيء واحد دون انقطاع لفترة زمنية محددة. قد يكون هذا التركيز على النفس، عداد، صورة، أو كلمة محددة (مانترا). 2. **تأمل اليقظة الذهنية**: - يتم التركيز على التنفس والإدراك للأفكار والأحاسيس والمشاعر التي تمر عبر الذهن، دون إصدار أحكام أو تفاعل معها. 3. **تأمل المشي**: - يُركز هذا النوع من التأمل على الشعور والاستشعار بالحركة أثناء المشي، ويعتمد على الإدراك العميق لكل خطوة. 4. **التأمل بالبصيرة** (Vipassana): - يهدف هذا النوع من التأمل إلى التعمق في فهم طبيعة العقل وتجربة الحياة بشكل أكثر وضوحًا. 5. **تمارين التنفس**: - التركيز على نمط التنفس، مثل التنفس العميق والتنفس الواعي، هو تقنية أساسية في ممارسات اليقظة الذهنية. 6. **التأمل الموجه**: - تتبّع تعليمات تأملية مسجلة توجه الذهن نحو استرخاء محدد أو تصور إيجابي. 7. **رياضة اليوغا**: - تعتبر اليوغا شكلا من أشكال التأمل في الحركة، حيث تجمع بين الأسانا (الوضعيات) والتنفس العميق لتعزيز اليقظة الذهنية والتركيز. كل هذه التقنيات يمكن أن تساعد في تطوير مهارات التأمل واليقظة الذهنية التي تُمكّن الأشخاص من الانتباه بصورة أكبر إلى تجاربهم اللحظية، تقليل تأثير الأفكار السلبية، وتعزيز الشعور بالسلام والهدوء الداخلي. من المفيد تجربة عدة تقنيات لتحديد الأنسب لك."},{"prompt":"العلاج المعرفي الادراكى","completion":"العلاج المعرفي الإدراكي، والذي يُشار إليه غالبًا باسم العلاج السلوكي المعرفي (CBT)، هو نموذج علاجي يهدف إلى تحسين الصحة النفسية من خلال التعامل مع أنماط التفكير (المعرفة) والسلوكيات غير المفيدة أو المدمرة. هذا النوع من العلاج يرتكز على فكرة أن أفكارنا ومشاعرنا وسلوكياتنا مترابطة بشكل وثيق، وأن تغيير الأفكار والسلوكيات السلبية يمكن أن يؤدي إلى تحسينات كبيرة في الحالة النفسية والعاطفية. # أهداف العلاج المعرفي الإدراكي 1. **تحديد الأفكار السلبية**: مساعدة الأفراد على التعرف على أفكارهم السلبية أو المشوهة التي تؤثر على مشاعرهم وسلوكياتهم. 2. **تحليل وتحدي الأفكار السلبية**: تعليم الأفراد كيفية تقييم أفكارهم السلبية بشكل نقدي وتحدي صحتها. 3. **تطوير استراتيجيات المواجهة**: تشجيع تطوير استراتيجيات إدراكية وسلوكية فعالة للتعامل مع الضغوط النفسية. 4. **تغيير السلوكيات**: تعليم الطرق للتغيير الإيجابي في السلوك لتعزيز تحسين المزاج والرفاه العام. # تقنيات العلاج المعرفي الإدراكي -

However, when integrating multiprocessing into a GUI application, especially one built with Kivy and involving networking (like your use case), it's crucial to manage the inter-process communication properly and ensure that the main event loop of the GUI remains responsive. Given your existing implementation, there are a few considerations and changes you might need to implement to incorporate multiprocessing, specifically for the \`listen_server\` functionality: 1. **Thread vs. Process**: Your current implementation uses \`threading.Thread\` for the \`_listen_server\` method. Threads run in the same memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces. For CPU-bound operations or when trying to leverage multiple CPU cores, multiprocessing can be more effective. However, for I/O bound operations, such as network communication or waiting for data, threading or asynchronous programming might be more suitable. 2. **Communicating Between Processes**: If you switch to multiprocessing, consider how you'd communicate between the main GUI process and the listening process. The \`multiprocessing\` module offers \`Queue\` and \`Pipe\` for inter-process communication. 3. **Integrating with Kivy's Event Loop**: Kivy runs an event loop that handles UI updates, and mixing it with asyncio or multiprocessing requires careful orchestration to ensure the UI remains responsive. You already use \`Clock.schedule_once\` to call back into the Kivy main loop from a thread, which is good practice. For multiprocessing, you'd similarly need a mechanism to safely communicate from your listening process back to the Kivy main thread. Here is a revised approach keeping the above considerations in mind. Given your specific case deals with network I/O and might not strictly benefit from multiprocessing over multithreading or asyncio for listening, I'll focus on guidelines rather than altering your code to multiprocessing: - **Evaluate the Need for Multiprocessing**: If your server listening task is I/O bound (waiting for network data), the existing threaded approach or using asyncio across the application might be sufficient and simpler to integrate with Kivy. - **Integrate Multiprocessing Carefully**: If you find a compelling reason to use multiprocessing (e.g., for CPU-intensive tasks alongside), ensure you understand how to communicate between processes and integrate these communications back into the Kivy event loop safely. - **AsyncIO Integration**: Your application is using \`asyncio\` for the Discord bot. Consider leveraging \`asyncio\` more extensively for I/O bound tasks, including the network listening part, while ensuring it's correctly integrated with Kivy’s event loop. This approach can offer a cohesive and efficient I/O concurrency model without introducing the complexities of multiprocessing. If you decide to proceed with multiprocessing for specific tasks, ensure to review Kivy's threading and multiprocessing guidelines to avoid issues with UI updates from non-main threads or processes. Remember, the key challenge in GUI applications with concurrency is maintaining responsive UIs and safely managing state updates from concurrent operations."},{"prompt":"can you do it fully working?","completion":"Creating a fully working example that incorporates multiprocessing or threading into a Kivy application for continuous server listening, especially with Discord bot integration, requires careful consideration of Kivy's event loop and the async nature of Discord.py.

As the elevator hummed its ascent, Ethan felt a mix of excitement and anticipation. He had known Marcus and the usual gang for over a decade, having bonded over college assignments, late-night study sessions, and countless memories since. The elevator dinged on the twenty-third floor, its doors sliding open to a dimly lit hallway that led to Marcus’s apartment, adorned with muffled sounds of music and laughter. Ethan, carrying a small, neatly wrapped gift under his arm, made his way to the door and knocked. The door swung open, revealing a scene unlike any Ethan had anticipated for a birthday celebration. The apartment was dimly lit with eerie, blue lights, casting long shadows against the walls. The guests seemed almost too engrossed in their conversations, their backs turned to him, their movements oddly synchronized. Feeling a twinge of unease, Ethan entered, attempting to shake off the creeping sense of strangeness. “Hey, man, happy birthday!” Ethan greeted, finding Marcus amidst the odd assembly. Marcus turned, his smile wide yet seemingly forced, “Ethan! So glad you could make it. Join in, join in!” As Ethan moved deeper into the party, he couldn’t help but notice the peculiar demeanor of the guests. Their laughter seemed hollower, their movements too stiff, and their conversations, though lively, felt rehearsed. It was as if everyone was acting, playing their part in a play Ethan hadn’t rehearsed for. Looking for some semblance of normalcy, Ethan attempted to strike up conversations, but each interaction felt more bizarre than the last, leading him to retreat to a corner, observing the party with growing apprehension.

Ethan’s heart hammered against his ribcage, his mind racing to make sense of the impossible scene unfolding before him. As he turned towards the door, planning his escape, the guests—or rather, the women—closed in around him, their movements no longer stiff but eerily fluid. Marcus approached, her face now that of a woman’s, her expression one of somber understanding. “Ethan, there’s no need to run. You were chosen to be here, to embrace who you really are.” Panic surged through Ethan as they pinned him down effortlessly. A strong tingling sensation erupted across his skin, rippling through his body with an intensity that bordered on pain and ecstasy. He could feel his skin, his very identity, peeling away, layer by layer, as if shedding a cocoon he had been unaware of. Released from their hold, Ethan staggered to his feet, the room spinning around him. His eyes caught a glimpse of a mirror across the room, and with trepidation, he approached it. The reflection that greeted him was not his own but that of a woman, her features a mirror of his, yet undeniably different. His, or rather, her eyes widened in shock, a hand reaching up to touch the face that she now bore. The room fell into a respectful silence, giving her a moment to grapple with the revelation. Marcus stepped forward, her voice gentle, “Welcome, sister. You’ve been living under a disguise you never needed. Here, you are seen for who you truly are.” Ethan, now standing before the mirror as a woman, felt a swell of emotions. Fear, confusion, but amidst it all, an underlying sense of rightness, of coming home. The guests, her new sisters, gathered around, their expressions welcoming, devoid of the oddness that had so unsettled him before.

Major cities around the world, London, Washington D.C., Tokyo, are all engulfed in a hellish blaze of atomic waste. 2042 - NATO decides to retaliate, launching nuclear missiles on major strategic and population centers of the enemy side as well. Almost halving the human population alive at the time. 2044 - To add insult to injury, a plague begins developing. with incurable effects and very resilient viruses, there is very little hope for humanity. 2050 - As of 1/1/2050, less than 1/3 of the original population of Earth at its peak in 2038 are still alive. (not counting those dead from natural causes). 2054 - Global resources being strained and very little population leads to the remaining factions and nations of Earth to call a temporary detente in order to get back together and hopefully keep mankind from becoming extinct. # [In their hopelessness, the spires rose.] 2055 - This period of hopelessness soons marks the beginning of a resurgence in religion, leading mankind to construct \\"doomspires\\", towering temples of multi-colored bricks to appease Blox. [[There are no further information markers in the records until 2099.]]\`\`\`","completion":"PART 2: \\"The Twilight of Divinity\\" # [The Sounding of the Trumpets] 2099, September 14 - As the solar eclipse darkens the skies, the first trumpet of the rapture sounds, a piercing note that reverberates through the souls of every living being. This heralds the beginning of what many believe to be the final judgement. 2099, December 11 - A comet, unseen by scientists until it is nearly upon the Earth, grazes the atmosphere, igniting the sky in a display of celestial fury. This event coincides with the sounding of the second trumpet, causing mass hysteria and reinforcing the belief that the end times are nigh. # [The Seven Years of Trials] 2100-2107 - The period known as the Seven Years of Trials begins, marked by further celestial and terrestrial cataclysms. Unnatural disasters ravage the Earth: oceans turn blood-red, wildfires consume entire continents, and darkness envelops the world for months at a time. With each disaster, another trumpet sounds. # [The Rise of the Redeemers] 2103, June 6 - Amidst the chaos, a group of individuals asserting extraordinary abilities and claiming divine mission, known as the Redeemers, rises. They gather followers, promising salvation and protection from the ongoing calamities. Cities and communities divide between those who believe in their divinity and those who see them as opportunists exploiting the world's despair. # [The Fracture of Faith] 2105, November 23 - A revelation rocks the world's remaining faithful: a leaked document, allegedly from a divine source, suggests that the so-called \\"end times\\" are not a predestined apocalypse but a test of faith, orchestrated by a disillusioned deity doubting its creations' worthiness. This revelation fractures the populace further, between unwavering believers, agnostics, and those who now view their gods as fallible beings. # [God's Despair] 2108, August 19 - In a move that shocks both the mortal and the celestial realms, the deity once revered as the omnipotent creator broadcasts a message of despair. Tired, disillusioned, and mourning the irredeemable state of humanity, the deity announces its intention to retreat from the universe, questioning whether creation was a mistake. # [The Disappearance] 2109, April 1 - Without fanfare, without a cataclysmic event, the deity vanishes. Prayers go unanswered, and the signs of divine presence fade from the world. The Redeemers, now without the divine backing they once claimed, lose their influence as the world grapples with the absence of its creator. # [Aftermath and the Age of Reflection] 2110 - The Earth, now quiet, begins the slow process of healing. Humanity, leaderless and left to its own devices, enters an era of introspection. Cultures that once centered around divine worship now seek meaning in the bonds of community, in the resilience of the human spirit, and in the stewardship of the planet. As the world moves on, some hope the deity might one day return, having found faith in its creation once more. Others speculate that perhaps the deity's \\"suicide\\" was not an end but a transformation, a shedding of an old persona to be reborn amidst those it had created. The truth remains a mystery, leaving humanity to ponder its place in a universe far vaster and more mysterious than it had ever imagined."},{"prompt":"J'aimerais ton aide pour traduire en anglais américain \\"Les chaînes russophones ont une ambiance décontractée ce soir, alors que 50 ou 70 « cyclomoteurs volants » survolent l'Irak en direction d'Israël, depuis l'Iran.

However, specific details like \\"GPT-4 Turbo: Research Preview (128K token limit, Short-Term Availability)\\" could refer to new developments or specific configurations OpenAI is testing or planning to release for research or limited usage. In general, OpenAI has been exploring ways to increase the efficiency, capability, and accessibility of their models. This involves enhancements that could allow models to process more information in a single prompt (like increasing the token limit), enhancing the model's understanding and generation capabilities, and making these advanced models available for researchers and developers to explore novel applications. **Regarding a 128K token limit**, traditionally, GPT-3 and its iterations have had much lower token limits for a single interaction. A significant increase, such as to 128K tokens, would represent a substantial enhancement in how much text the model can consider or generate in a single interaction, massively expanding its use cases in tasks requiring deep, context-rich operations, like analyzing long-form documents in a single go or creating extensive content in one prompt. **Short-term availability** might refer to OpenAI providing access to these enhanced capabilities on a limited basis, possibly to gather user feedback, conduct research, or manage resource constraints. This can help them fine-tune the system before a broader release. Remember, the details about future models like GPT-4, its variants, or specific features like \\"Turbo\\" modes, are speculative until confirmed by direct announcements from OpenAI.

It's important to clarify that while individuals and organizations can use OpenAI's API to create various applications with personalized features or datasets, each of these projects operates under the terms and access set by OpenAI. If you're referring to accessing a model like \\"Yuntian Deng's ChatGPT\\" without going through OpenAI's official channels or API, the details would highly depend on how the model is hosted and shared. Typically, there are a few key points to consider: 1. **API Access**: Accessing any version of GPT (including specialized versions) for most users involves interacting with the model through OpenAI's API, which requires an API key. This is how OpenAI controls and monitors the use of their technology to ensure it's used ethically and within their guidelines. 2. **Custom Implementations**: If Yuntian Deng or anyone else has developed a customized version of ChatGPT or a unique interface for interacting with OpenAI's models, the accessibility of that tool to the public would be governed by the creator. They might host it on a web platform, provide access through a specific interface, or even integrate it within a larger application. The availability and access method would vary significantly based on the creator's intent and the technical setup. 3. **Terms and Conditions**: Using OpenAI's technology, including customized versions thereof, would still be subject to OpenAI's terms of use, guidelines, and API usage policies. Even if a custom interface or application is created, the underlying use of the AI models should comply with OpenAI's rules, including attribution and permissible use cases. 4. **Direct Hosting and Sharing**: In scenarios where a developer or researcher wants to share their custom model or application based on GPT with others without going through OpenAI's API, they would need to ensure they're not violating OpenAI's intellectual property rights or their API's terms of service. This could involve sharing code that interfaces with the OpenAI API (where users would still need their own API keys) or offering a standalone application that does not dynamically use OpenAI's models but was trained or informed by them under permissible conditions. Without more specific details, it's challenging to provide a precise answer on how to access \\"Yuntian Deng's ChatGPT\\" or any analogous project without standard OpenAI channels.

First off, the arena of Naive Bayes from scratch. Picture three contenders, each tweaking the recipe of preprocessing texts - from the meticulous weeding out of new lines, minuscule characters, and stop words, to the strategic play of lowercasing and special character omission. Tokenization and lemmatization tools, spacy and stanza, are switched up, hoping for a linguistic edge. Despite their valiant efforts, their accuracies flutter like leaves in the wind, with model performances ranging modestly, hovering around 50%, while the F1-Score dances around 3.5%, more or less a whisper in the storm. Next, enter the Scikit-learn Naive bayes gladiators, armed with pre-trained prowess. These models, wielding the sharp blades of Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer, step into the fray. The Count Vectorizer model slashes through with an impressive 68.59% mean average and an F1-Score of 13.37%, while the TF-IDF counterpart, though sturdy, trails with a 54.1% mean average and a 4.08% F1-Score. A tale of two strategies, where the raw count of words seems to have outmaneuvered the finesse of term frequency-inverse document frequency. Lastly, the titans of Word Embedding Models manifest, leveraging the colossal power of pre-trained embeddings: Glove, Word2Vec, and FastText, each with a vocabulary arsenal stretching from 400K to 3M words. When the dust settles, it's the Glove wielding its magic twice, tweaking maximum iterations and regularization, that steals the spotlight. Results soar up to a remarkable 72.79% mean average, with the F1-Score reaching a peak of 37.54% in its most balanced incarnation. It's a demonstration of how adjusting the knobs of iteration and regulation can fine-tune performance to nearly symphonic levels. In an interesting twist, changing the solver – the algorithmic heartbeat of logistic regression – barely nudges the needle of accuracy and F1 scores, suggesting that sometimes, the choice of weapon might not be as critical as the strategy and understanding of the battlefield. This exploration into the battleground of text classification uncovers the nuanced power struggles between models, preprocessing choices, and the relentless quest for balance and supremacy in the numeric representation of words. It’s a riveting narrative of trial, error, and triumph in the face of linguistic complexity."},{"prompt":"shorten it","completion":"Diving into the world of text classification, we explore a diverse array of models battling the complexities of language with numbers.

From the output of the \`run_tests\` call, we can identify specific issues in the functions related to \`same_length_sublists\` and \`fibonacci_sublists\`.

A closer look reveals the problem might be with the handling of lists of different sizes, specifically when lists are empty. Rectification: Ensure that the recursive checking of list lengths is not oversimplified, and actually compares each pair of lists correctly while accounting for empty lists as well. \`\`\`prolog all_same_length([]). % Remove the duplicate base case here. all_same_length([_]). % A single-element list has all \\"elements\\" of the same length by default. all_same_length([X, Y | T]) :- length(X, L), length(Y, L), all_same_length([Y | T]). \`\`\` # 2. \`fibonacci_sublists/1\`: The test labeled \`zero\`, intended to evaluate a single empty list, failed. It seems you might have duplicated the base case in the \`fibonacci_sublists\` predicate that could interfere with correct evaluation. Also, it's essential that the Fibonacci condition is clearly enforced for sequences larger than two elements. Rectification: Focus on ensuring that the base cases are correctly specified and that recursion duly respects the Fibonacci sequence property for list lengths. \`\`\`prolog fibonacci_sublists([]). fibonacci_sublists([_]). fibonacci_sublists([_, _]). \`\`\` Remove the duplicate base case and ensure that the sequence's progression follows the Fibonacci rule accurately by summing the lengths of the previous two lists to match the length of the current list before continuing the recursion. # Remaining Tests: Beyond these two, the other tests passed or are blocked due to the 'TODO' placeholder in \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`. You need a strategy to convert operation expressions to prefix notation using the functions you have already implemented. Since recursion and built-ins are restricted, consider leveraging your \`named_to_op_expr\` or similar predicates to achieve this conversion.

Correction for \`same_length_sublists/1\` In your \`all_same_length/1\` predicate, the duplicated base case is not only redundant, as previously mentioned, but also incorrect. The second base case should ensure handling of a single list correctly, e.g., by indicating that a list with a single sublist complies without needing to compare lengths. The core logic for \`all_same_length/1\` seems correct but let's clarify and correct it: \`\`\`prolog all_same_length([]). all_same_length([_]). % Correct handling for a single list all_same_length([X, Y | T]) :- length(X, L), length(Y, L), all_same_length([Y | T]). \`\`\` Ensure this correction replaces your current implementation of \`all_same_length/1\` in the \`same_length_sublists/1\` section, removing the incorrect duplicate base case. # 2. Correction for \`fibonacci_sublists/1\` The problem with \`fibonacci_sublists/1\` arises from the unnecessary duplicate of the base case and misunderstanding of how Fibonacci sequences should start. You correctly handled lists up to a length of two directly. However, by providing two base cases (\`fibonacci_sublists([]).\`), one of them becomes unreachable and redundant.

Az oxigén bejutása a sejtekbe lehetővé teszi az energiatermelést, az anyagcsere folyamatokat és más fontos élettani funkciókat, azonban a levegőben található szennyező anyagok, például a kipufogógázok, cigarettafüst vagy ipari szennyeződések sokszor káros hatással lehetnek a sejtek egészségére. A légzés során belélegzett káros anyagok bekerülhetnek a véráramba, majd eljuthatnak a sejtekig és károsíthatják azok működését. Ez hozzájárulhat különböző egészségügyi problémákhoz, például a tüdő- és légúti betegségekhez, szív- és érrendszeri problémákhoz vagy akár daganatos megbetegedésekhez is. Ezért fontos odafigyelni a tiszta, friss levegőre, kerülni a környezetszennyezést és megfelelő légzéstechnikákat alkalmazni annak érdekében, hogy minimalizálni lehessen a káros anyagok okozta egészségkárosodásokat a sejtszinten."},{"prompt":"Én azt hallottam, hogy a légzés során a szervezetbe jutatott oxigén segítségével a sejtek mitokondriumai égetnek, és ez az égés károkat okoz a sejtekben.","completion":"Az égés folyamata valóban történik a sejtekben, és ennek során oxigén segítségével a mitokondriumokban energiatermelés zajlik, amely során szabad gyökök is keletkezhetnek.

The error messages indicate that this predicate (\`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\`) is being called but has not been defined in your script. Given the error context and the goal to convert operations to prefix tokens based on earlier procedures, it appears the intent is to transform expressions given in operator form (e.g., \`+(1, 2)\`) into a format that could be seen as an in-house representation (i.e., using \`add\`, \`mul\`), and then to utilize existing conversion routines to generate prefix notation for these expressions. There is no specific implementation for \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` as required. However, this predicate seems to be intended to convert standard Prolog arithmetic expressions into named expressions (\`add(X,Y)\`, \`mul(X,Y)\`) used in other predicates in your module. A simple correction would involve either removing the call to an unimplemented/incorrect predicate or implementing the missing predicate correctly. However, since your challenge involves using only existing predicates, you should directly convert expressions to prefix tokens without declaring or utilizing \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\`. But based on the context provided, here's an approach for directly realizing \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` without an intermediate conversion through an unimplemented function like \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\`. This updated version optimizes your flow by assuming you want to directly tokenize expressions: Assuming the task requires direct processing of Prolog expressions to prefix notation tokens using the defined predicates, a simple fix is that instead of transforming through an intermediate custom representation, you directly parse \`Expr\` into a token list in \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`. However, without modifying the underlying logic significantly and without a direct implementation, a specific fix for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is challenging to suggest. The core idea would involve parsing the \`Expr\` for \`add\`, \`mul\`, and integers directly to tokens, which seems to misinterpret the referenced \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` function's purpose. If you still need to correct or implement missing functionality, you would ideally provide the logic for converting operator expressions (like \`+(1,2)\`) directly to their prefix forms and then use already defined predicates for handling names (\`add\`, \`mul\`) and evaluation. For the sake of guidance, if \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` was meant to play a part, it would ideally convert expressions from named to operator-based or vice versa. But, your \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` seems to inverse the logic by referring to a non-existent conversion before tokenizing—which isn't possible unless you redefine your approach. If you have any specific functionality in mind for \`named_expr_to_op_expr/2\` or need further direction on how to handle \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`, please provide more details or clarify how you envision the conversion process working with the rest of your predicates."},{"prompt":"Paciente do sexo masculino, 50 anos, diabético tipo 2, ensino fundamental completo, gerente de comércio de loja de varejo.

Utilizando as porcentagens estipuladas para macronutrientes, temos: - **Carboidratos: 55%** de 1700 kcal = 935 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 233,75g. - **Proteínas: 15,9%** de 1700 kcal = 270,4 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 67,6g. - **Lipídios: 29,1%** de 1700 kcal = 494,7 kcal ÷ 9 kcal/g = 54,9g. # B) Escolha da dieta enteral: - A dieta recomenda é **polimérica**, pois é indicada para pacientes que não têm problemas de digestão ou absorção severos e têm necessidade de uma dieta de alta densidade calórica e proteica, especialmente útil em casos de caquexia ou processo de desnutrição avançada. # C) Prescrição da Nutrição Enteral: - **Via de administração:** Sonda Nasogástrica (SNG), escolhida por ser uma via acessível, menos invasiva, e adequada para administrações de curto a médio prazo, especialmente quando o trato gastrointestinal está funcionando bem. - **Fórmula:** Polimérica, com volume total de 1133 mL e densidade calórica de 1.5 kcal/mL, totalizando uma VCT de 1700 kcal, apresentando uma distribuição que se alinha com as necessidades do paciente. - **Distribuição macronutrientes:** - **Proteína:** 20% de 1700 kcal = 340 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 85g, equivalente a 1,63g/kg, o que é hiperproteico e indicado para apoio no reparo e manutenção de tecidos em um cenário catabólico. - **Lipídio:** 35%, resultando em 66,1g, ajustado para corresponder a uma ingestão normal lipídica. - **Carboidrato:** 45%, totalizando 191,25g, considerada hipoglicídica, adequando-se às necessidades energéticas sem sobrecarregar o sistema com excesso de glicose. - **Fibras:** 17g de fibra total, sendo 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel, importante para a saúde gastrointestinal. - **Micronutrientes:** De acordo com o DRI’s 2002, ajustados para as necessidades específicas do paciente exceto as particularidades não especificadas. - **Água:** 200 mL adicional, com administração intermitente em 4 etapas de 280 mL, divididas ao longo do dia, ajudando a garantir hidratação adequada além da nutrição. # Administração: - **Administração intermitente de 4 etapas** - Volume por etapa: 280 mL. - Horários: 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, e 16:00. - Gotejamento: Aproximadamente 90 mL/hora. Esses parâmetros foram escolhidos considerando a necessidade de manter o equilíbrio nutricional e a hidratação, a tolerabilidade do paciente à dieta enteral, assim como a capacidade do sistema digestivo em processar a alimentação. A distribuição horária permite fornecer nutrição adequada ao longo do dia, promovendo uma melhor assimilação dos nutrientes e mitigando potenciais efeitos adversos da terapia nutricional enteral."},{"prompt":"não entendi a parte das fibras e da agua e das horas realizar o calculo","completion":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior. Vamos esclarecer esses pontos com as explicações detalhadas e simplificadas: **Parte das Fibras:** A prescrição menciona 17 gramas de fibra total, sendo 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel. A distribuição das fibras na dieta é importante para facilitar a função intestinal, prevenir constipação e melhorar a saúde digestiva. A fórmula enteral mencionada na prescrição contém 7,5g de fibra por 100mL, e a dieta total tem 1133mL. Com base nisso, vamos calcular a quantidade de fibra na dieta total: A densidade da fibra na fórmula é 7,5g/100mL, então, para encontrar a quantidade total de fibra fornecida, fazemos a seguinte conta: - (frac{7,5g}{100mL} times 1133mL = 85g) de fibra total na dieta. Este cálculo não bate com a descrição, parece ter havido um mal-entendido nos cálculos. A quantidade correta seria baseada diretamente nas informações do produto e no volume total administrado. Se considerarmos o exemplo dado inicialmente errôneo e focarmos na descrição, poderíamos simplificar que para 1133 mL de dieta enteral, a proporção de fibras é determinada pelas especificações do produto, não pelo cálculo errado fornecido. O correto é olhar para a descrição do produto e ver quantos gramas de fibra são fornecidos por mL ou por porção total e então multiplicar pelo volume que está sendo administrado para chegar ao total de fibras. **Parte da Água:** Quanto à água, foi mencionado que adicionalmente são fornecidos 200mL de água (90mL por frasco utilizado para lavagem da sonda). Isso é importante para garantir a hidratação adequada do paciente e também para manter a sonda limpa e funcionando corretamente. O paciente necessita de uma certa quantidade de água por dia para suas necessidades fisiológicas, e, ao receber nutrição enteral, parte dessa necessidade de água é suprida pela própria fórmula enteral, mas água adicional é frequentemente necessária para atingir as necessidades totais de hidratação. **Cálculos das Horas:** A administração intermitente foi prescrita para ser feita em 4 etapas de 280mL, nos seguintes horários: 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, e 16:00, com gotejamento de 90mL por hora. Isso significa que cada sessão de alimentação é destinada a durar cerca de 3 horas com um fluxo controlado para facilitar a digestão e absorção dos nutrientes, evitando sobrecarregar o sistema gastrointestinal do paciente. Espero que isso esclareça suas dúvidas. Se precisar de mais alguma explicação, sinta-se à vontade para perguntar."},{"prompt":"não entendi ainda","completion":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior. Vamos simplificar e corrigir as explicações sobre os cálculos das fibras, da água e da administração baseada no horário, passo a passo, considerando que houve um erro na explicação da fibra. # Fibra: Baseado no produto hipotético fornecido, a descrição não corresponde diretamente aos valores comuns, mas vamos nos alinhar aos dados fornecidos inicialmente para a explicação: - Na descrição original, a dieta enteral prescrita contém 17g de fibras totais para o volume total de 1133mL. Isso já é uma informação fechada e não requer cálculo adicional baseado na nossa explicação inicial. O que é relevante sobre as fibras é a sua divisão: 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel. Na prática, isso indicaria que se considera benéfico para a saúde intestinal misturar fibras solúveis (que ajudam na digestão e podem ajudar a regular o açúcar no sangue) e insolúveis (que ajudam na movimentação do trânsito intestinal). # Água: - A prescrição mencionava 200mL de água adicional, divididos em 90mL por frasco. Essa água é usada para lavagem da sonda, o que é uma prática comum para manter a sonda desobstruída e para garantir uma hidratação adequada do paciente. A água para lavagem da sonda não contribui significativamente para a ingesta hídrica total do paciente, sendo mais uma medida de manutenção da sonda. # Administração baseada no horário: - A administração da dieta enteral foi planejada para ser intermitente, dividida em 4 etapas, ao longo do dia nos horários: 7:00, 10:00, 13:00, e 16:00. - Cada etapa consiste na administração de 280mL da formulação, totalizando 1133mL ao final do dia. A taxa de administração seria cerca de 90 mL por hora, o que indica que cada 280mL deveria ser administrado aproximadamente em um pouco mais de 3 horas. Porém, tal explicação está simplificada e arredondada para fins explicativos. Na prática, a distribuição ao longo do dia se ajustaria à necessidade de garantir que todo o volume seja administrado. Na realidade, se você administrar 280mL a uma taxa de 90mL/hora, levaria pouco mais de 3 horas para concluir cada fase da administração. Então, a programação horária original precisaria ser ajustada para acomodar essa duração. Portanto, os horários fornecidos deveriam ser considerados iniciais, com pausas adequadas para que o paciente não seja sobrecarregado pela alimentação enteral, permitindo assimilação adequada e conforto. Espero que essa explicação simplificada e corrigida tenha ajudado a esclarecer como os cálculos das fibras, água e administração baseada em horário funcionam na formulação de uma dieta enteral."},{"prompt":"agora nessa atividade faça de acordo com o exemplo da de cima a parte da prescrição completa A.K.M, 52 anos, engenheiro mecânico, procedente de Manaus e internado a dois dias no HRT em dieta zero aguardando cirurgia.

A menção de \\"53% solúvel e 1.7% insolúvel\\" no contexto referente à distribuição de fibras na formulação da dieta enteral parece ter sido um erro de digitação ou interpretação. Vamos corrigir e esclarecer este ponto: Para uma dieta enteral completa que inclui 17g de fibras totais e descreve a porcentagem solúvel e insolúvel da fibra, a distribuição correta seria baseada na quantidade total de fibras fornecida pela dieta. Se a divisão indicada fosse de \\"53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel\\" (que é o correto ao invés de 1.7% insoluvel), a ideia é que estas percentagens se referem à composição das fibras na dieta em relação ao total de 17g de fibras. Aqui está como seria calculado corretamente baseado no total de 17g de fibras: - **Fibras Solúveis:** Se 53% das fibras são solúveis, então (17g times 53% = 9,01g) de fibras solúveis. - **Fibras Insolúveis:** Se o resto são fibras insolúveis (o que daria 47% baseado em uma divisão 100% - 53%), então (17g times 47% = 7,99g) de fibras insolúveis. Isso significa que, do total de 17g de fibra presente na dieta enteral, aproximadamente 9,01g são fibras solúveis e 7,99g são fibras insolúveis. A fração percentual anteriormente mencionada (1.7% insolúvel) foi um erro, e o correto é entender que 47% do conteúdo total de fibra é insolúvel, completando os 100% do conteúdo de fibra com os 53% sendo solúveis. Isso assegura a integralidade e a exatidão da descrição sobre a composição das fibras na formulação alimentar enteral. Fibras solúveis são conhecidas por sua capacidade de se dissolver em água formando um gel, o que pode auxiliar na digestão e na absorção de glicose, além de contribuir para a saúde cardiovascular. As fibras insolúveis ajudam no trânsito intestinal, prevenindo a constipação. Espero que esta explicação tenha esclarecido a questão sobre a distribuição das fibras na dieta enteral. Se houver mais alguma dúvida, fique à vontade para perguntar."},{"prompt":"quantos frascos normalmente é usado em dietas enterais?","completion":"A quantidade de frascos utilizados em dietas enterais pode variar significativamente dependendo de vários fatores, incluindo o valor calórico total diário prescrito, a densidade calórica da fórmula enteral escolhida, e o volume que cada frasco contém. As dietas enterais são produzidas em diferentes formulações e concentrações, e os frascos podem ter volumes variados, com opções comuns no mercado incluindo 200 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, e até 1000 ml por frasco ou saco. Para entender como calcular a quantidade de frascos necessários, é importante conhecer: 1. **Valor Calórico Total (VCT) Diário Necessário:** Quantas calorias no total o paciente precisa por dia. 2. **Densidade Calórica da Fórmula:** Quantas calorias são fornecidas por ml da fórmula enteral escolhida (exemplo: 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 kcal/ml são comuns). 3. **Volume de Fórmula por Frasco:** Quantos ml de fórmula estão em cada frasco. **Exemplo de Cálculo:** Se um paciente necessita de 2000 kcal por dia, e está utilizando uma fórmula enteral com densidade calórica de 1.5 kcal/ml, primeiro determine o volume total de fórmula necessário por dia: - Volume Total Necessário = 2000 kcal / 1.5 kcal/ml = 1333 ml por dia. Se os frascos da fórmula enteral escolhida contêm 500 ml cada um, então: - Quantidade de Frascos por Dia = 1333 ml / 500 ml/frasco = 2.67. Neste caso, seriam necessário usar 3 frascos por dia (arredondando o número para o próximo valor inteiro, já que não se utilizam frascos parcialmente, em geral, na prática). **Considerações Importantes:** - Nem todos os pacientes recebem a totalidade de suas necessidades nutricionais via dieta enteral. Alguns podem estar em regime de transição ou receber suplementação oral ou parenteral paralelamente. - A administração da fórmula deve ser dividida ao longo do dia em doses frequentes ou contínuas, dependendo da tolerância gastrointestinal do paciente, da capacidade do estômago, e do regime de administração (contínua vs. bolus/intermitente). - Alguns frascos possuem sistemas fechados de administração que podem se conectar diretamente ao equipamento de alimentação, enquanto outros podem exigir transferência para uma bolsa de alimentação enteral. O planejamento da dieta enteral e a escolha de produtos devem ser feitos por profissionais de saúde qualificados, como médicos e nutricionistas, que considerarão as necessidades individuais do paciente e as recomendações clínicas para fornecer a melhor opção de nutrição enteral."},{"prompt":"tá antes me mostre como é o calculo de fibras soluveis e insoluveis","completion":"Vou mostrar como calcular a quantidade de fibras solúveis e insolúveis em uma dieta enteral, usando a exemplo uma formulação hipotética que contenha fibras em sua composição, com o percentual dessas fibras claramente declarado. Imaginemos que a dieta enteral forneça um total de 17 gramas de fibra por dia, com uma divisão de 53% de fibras solúveis e 47% de fibras insolúveis. **Passo 1: Identificar o total de fibras fornecidas pela dieta** - Total de fibras fornecidas: 17g/dia. **Passo 2: Determinar a porcentagem de fibras solúveis e insolúveis** - Fibras Solúveis: 53% do total das fibras. - Fibras Insolúveis: 47% do total das fibras. **Passo 3: Calcular a quantidade de cada tipo de fibra** Para calcular a quantidade de fibras solúveis: - (17g times 53% = 17g times 0,53 = 9,01g) Para calcular a quantidade de fibras insolúveis: - (17g times 47% = 17g times 0,47 = 7,99g) **Conclusão do Cálculo** - Fibras Solúveis: 9,01g por dia. - Fibras Insolúveis: 7,99g por dia. Esses cálculos significam que, do total de 17 gramas de fibra fornecidos pela dieta enteral diariamente, 9,01 gramas são fibras solúveis, e 7,99 gramas são fibras insolúveis. **Por que isso é importante?** - **Fibras Solúveis:** Podem ajudar a diminuir os níveis de glucose e colesterol no sangue. Elas se dissolvem na água formando um gel e podem ajudar na saúde do trato digestivo. - **Fibras Insolúveis:** São benéficas para a saúde intestinal, pois aumentam o volume das fezes e ajudam a comida a passar mais rapidamente pelo estômago e intestinos. Estratégias nutricionais que incorporam ambas as fibras solúveis e insolúveis são essenciais para o manejo eficaz de várias condições, incluindo constipação, controle da glicemia, e manutenção da saúde cardiovascular. Cada tipo de fibra desempenha um papel distinto na saúde, e a combinação adequada pode ajudar a otimizar os benefícios nutricionais da dieta enteral."},{"prompt":"fibras soluveis não seria 1,7 ?","completion":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior e pela mistura nos dados. Com base nas informações fornecidas originalmente, houve um erro de interpretação nas porcentagens especificadas de fibras solúveis e insolúveis. Se citado originalmente \\"53% solúvel e 1,7 % insoluvel,\\" isso indicaria um erro na descrição pois normalmente as porcentagens de fibra solúvel e insolúvel deveriam somar 100% do total de fibras presentes na dieta. Uma declaração correta seria algo como \\"53% do total de fibras são solúveis e 47% são insolúveis\\" se estivermos lidando com uma porcentagem do total de fibras fornecidas pela dieta, baseada no exemplo de cálculo fornecido para um total de 17g de fibras. Para esclarecer a descrepância e corrigir qualquer mal-entendido: - Se houve menção a 1,7% em algum contexto que sugeria um tipo de fibra (solúvel ou insolúvel), isso parece estar fora de contexto ou incorretamente expresso. Normalmente, a composição de fibra numa fórmula enteral ou em qualquer alimento é dada em gramas e, quando expressa em porcentagem, refere-se à porção do total de fibras alimentares que é solúvel ou insolúvel. **Correção e Esclarecimento:** Para calcular corretamente com base em 17g de fibras totais, se 53% são solúveis (o que é uma interpetação correta do contexto padrão): - Fibras Solúveis = (17g times 53% = 9,01g). E, para a porcentagem restante sendo fibras insolúveis, baseando-se numa distribuição complementar de 100% do total das fibras: - Fibras Insolúveis = (17g times 47% = 7,99g). Não tem como aplicar diretamente o percentual de 1,7% ao cálculo sem um entendimento claro do que esse número representaria em relação ao total de fibras. Se você viu \\"1,7%\\" referido em algum contexto específico como parte da composição de fibra (solúvel ou insolúvel), talvez tenha havido um erro de digitação ou interpretação no contexto original. Para objetividade e clareza na nutrição enteral, e considerando a importância da fibra na dieta, tanto fibras solúveis quanto insolúveis são cruciais para a gestão da saúde gastrointestinal, com fibras solúveis ajudando no controle de glicose no sangue e redução de colesterol, e fibras insolúveis auxiliando na regularização do trânsito intestinal. Ambas contribuem para a saúde intestinal e prevenção de constipação."},{"prompt":"tá você está certo tinha visto errado agora faça desse paciente A.K.M, 52 anos, engenheiro mecânico, procedente de Manaus e internado a dois dias no HRT em dieta zero aguardando cirurgia.

Em relação à solubilidade: - **Inulina:** É uma fibra solúvel. - **Fibra de Trigo:** Pode conter tanto fibras solúveis quanto insolúveis, mas comumente associada à fração insolúvel. - **Celulose microcristalina:** É uma fibra insolúvel. Considerando o perfil geral das fontes de fibras mencionadas e a distribuição percentual fornecida, vamos estabelecer as quantidades: 1. **Fibras Solúveis (Inulina):** Representando 50% do total das fibras. 2. **Fibras Insolúveis (Fibra de Trigo + Celulose microcristalina):** Combinando 33% + 17% = 50% de fibra de trigo e celulose microcristalina presumivelmente contribuem majoritariamente à fração insolúvel. Dado que temos 20g totais de fibras por litro no Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, a distribuição seria: - **Fibras Solúveis:** 50% do total de fibras = 10g. - **Fibras Insolúveis:** 50% (restantes) do total de fibras = 10g.

Relação 100:1 Calorias Não Proteicas por g N2 - Hiperproteicas com Fórmula Hipertônica (600 mos m/L):** Essa relação descreve a proporção entre calorias não provenientes de proteínas (carboidratos e lipídios, essencialmente) e o nitrogênio proveniente das proteínas. Importante para garantir que o paciente receba energia suficiente sem sobrecarregar o organismo com excesso proteico. Em dietas enterais, essa relação é relevante para o equilíbrio metabólico. **Cálculo de Nitrogênio Total a partir da Proteína:** Cada grama de proteína contém aproximadamente 16% de nitrogênio. Para uma dieta que fornece 85g de proteína: - Nitrogênio total = 85g x 0,16 = 13,6g de N. Se estamos falando de uma fórmula que fornece uma relação de 100:1 de calorias não proteicas por grama de nitrogênio, isso implicaria em fornecer 100 calorias para cada grama de nitrogênio: - Calorias não proteicas necessárias para 13,6g de N = 13,6g x 100 = 1360 calorias. **Fórmula Hipertônica (600 mosm/L):** A osmolaridade de uma solução enteral reflete sua concentração de partículas solúveis. Fórmulas com osmolaridades superiores a 300 mosm/L são consideradas hipertônicas. Glucerna 1.5, com 600 mosm/L, é significativamente hipertônica, o que pode aumentar o risco de desconforto gastrointestinal se não for administrada cuidadosamente. Isso se deve à alta concentração de solutos, exigindo atenção especial na velocidade de infusão e na necessidade de diluição. **2. Água 200mL dividido em 90mL por frasco:** - Esta parte se refere à prática de higienização da sonda entre as administrações da fórmula enteral. A água ajuda a prevenir a obstrução da sonda e a manter a hidratação do paciente. Se você tem um volume total de água de 200mL e utiliza 90mL para lavar a sonda por frasco, isso ajudaria no cálculo de quantos frascos você pode administrar com esse volume total de água destinado à lavagem. **Administração Intermitente em 4 etapas de 280mL:** - Dividindo a dieta enteral ao longo do dia em quatro doses ajuda a melhorar a tolerância gastrointestinal, permitindo uma absorção mais gradual dos nutrientes.

Observação: Parece haver alguma confusão na aplicação desses cálculos e descrições específicas para o produto Glucerna 1.5 mencionado e as prescrições descritas anteriormente. A Glucerna 1.5 é uma fórmula específica, projetada principalmente para pacientes com diabetes ou para aqueles que necessitam de um controle glicêmico cuidadoso, sendo rica em fibras e com um perfil de macronutrientes adaptado para essas necessidades. Entretanto, o princípio de calcular o necessário baseando-se nas informações nutricionais do produto aplicado permanece o mesmo. Para a prescrição precisa, é fundamental consultar as informações específicas do produto e ajustar os volumes e distribuições baseando-se na necessidade calórica e nutricional do paciente, respectivamente."},{"prompt":"no outro paciente como ficaria isso ?","completion":"Para o paciente A.K.M., tendo em vista as especificações nutricionais e baseado nas diretrizes BRASPEN 2023 e nos detalhes fornecidos anteriormente, vamos refazer a prescrição utilizando o exemplo e as diretrizes aplicáveis.

As recomendações da BRASPEN (2023) para pacientes em estados agudos e de recuperação, especialmente para aqueles que sofreram trauma ou cirurgia, variam entre 1,2 a 2,5 g/kg de peso/dia, dependendo da fase de tratamento. Dado que o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre foi prescrito assim: - **Fase Inicial:** cerca de 1,2 g/kg de proteína/dia. - **Após o Dia 4:** aumenta para até 2,0 g/kg/dia conforme as diretrizes. Considerando o peso do paciente (63,5 kg) e a quantidade de proteína aumentada na fase de recuperação, esta dieta pode ser caracterizada como hiperproteica, particularmente na fase de recuperação pós-aguda, onde a quantidade prescrita é significativamente maior do que as necessidades proteicas básicas, apoiando a cicatrização e o anabolismo. # Hipertônica Uma formulação é considerada hipertônica com base na sua osmolaridade, que é a concentração de solutos por litro de solução. Uma osmolaridade superior a 300 mosm/L geralmente caracteriza uma fórmula como hipertônica. Essas formulações demandam cuidados especiais na administração, pois podem aumentar o risco de desconforto gastrointestinal, diarreia ou necessidade de diluição antes da administração. Embora os dados específicos da osmolaridade do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre não tenham sido fornecidos explicitamente na descrição inicial, produtos com densidade calórica de 1.2 kcal/mL ou superior geralmente têm uma osmolaridade mais alta, muitas vezes classificando-os como hipertônicos. Esta classificação depende também de outros fatores, como a quantidade e o tipo de solutos presentes na fórmula. # Conclusão Com base na prescrição para o paciente A.K.M. utilizando o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, a dieta pode ser considerada hiperproteica, especialmente na fase pós-aguda com o aumento progressivo da quantidade de proteína per kg. Sem os detalhes exatos da osmolaridade do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, não podemos afirmar com certeza sua classificação como hipertônica, mas é possível que ela se enquadre nessa categoria, especialmente se a sua osmolaridade exceder 300 mosm/L, o que é comum para formulações nutricionais concentradas destinadas a pacientes em situações clínicas específicas, como recuperação de trauma."},{"prompt":"se a osmolaridade é 345 por que deu 300 me explica ?","completion":"Houve um equívoco na comunicação anterior. Se a osmolaridade da fórmula Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre especificada para a sua utilização é de 345 mosm/L, então está correto afirmar que a formulação é hipertônica. Para esclarecer: **Osmolaridade e Classificação da Solução:** 1. **Isotônica:** A osmolaridade é similar à do fluido corporal, que é aproximadamente 290 mosm/L. Soluções isotônicas são usadas para hidratar os pacientes sem causar grandes movimentações de fluidos dentro ou fora das células. 2. **Hipotônica:** A osmolaridade é menor que 290 mosm/L. Isso pode levar à entrada de água nas células, aumentando o risco de edema celular em determinadas condições. 3. **Hipertônica:** A osmolaridade é maior que 290 mosm/L, podendo exceder 300 mosm/L. Soluções hipertônicas têm uma concentração maior de solutos comparada aos fluidos corporais, o que pode causar a movimentação de água para fora das células, potencialmente resultando em desidratação celular se administradas rapidamente ou sem adequada monitorização. No cenário descrito, **uma osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L claramente classifica a fórmula Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre como hipertônica**. Esta classificação implica que a solução tem uma maior concentração de solutos do que o plasma sanguíneo. A osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L pode aumentar o risco de desconforto gastrointestinal, incluindo náuseas, vômitos, diarreia, ou outros problemas gastrointestinais se a fórmula for administrada rapidamente ou sem diluição prévia adequada, especialmente em pacientes que possam ser mais sensíveis, como aqueles com função gastrointestinal comprometida. É crucial administrar formulações hipertônicas como Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre de acordo com as recomendações específicas, incluindo a possibilidade de diluição ou ajuste na velocidade de administração. A monitorização cuidadosa do paciente é necessária para garantir tolerância e ajustar o tratamento conforme necessário. Isso pode incluir medidas como a introdução gradual da fórmula, monitoramento para sinais de intolerância gastrointestinal, e a adequação de fluidos adicionais para manter a hidratação adequada do paciente."},{"prompt":"Então seria hiperproteicas com formula hipertonica ?","completion":"Sim, com base nas informações fornecidas, se o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre tem uma osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L, então ele é considerado uma solução hipertônica. Além disso, considerando a quantidade recomendada de proteínas na dieta (particularmente na fase pós-aguda, com recomendações de até 2,0 g/kg/dia), pode ser classificada como hiperproteica para o paciente A.K.M., especialmente quando estamos objetivando apoio à recuperação de trauma, cirurgia ou outras condições que necessitem de uma maior ingestão proteica para reparo e manutenção de tecidos. # O que Significa Hiperproteica com Fórmula Hipertônica? - **Hiperproteica:** Refere-se à dieta ou fórmula que contém uma quantidade maior de proteínas do que as dietas padrão. Isso é frequentemente usado para promover a cicatrização, recuperar ou manter a massa muscular, e apoiar o sistema imunológico. No caso do paciente A.K.M., a dieta evolui para até 2,0 g/kg/dia de proteína após o quarto dia, conforme o estado de recuperação permite, classificando-a na categoria de hiperproteicas. - **Fórmula Hipertônica:** A fórmula com osmolaridade acima de 290-300 mosm/L é referida como hipertônica. Essas características exigem que a fórmula seja administrada com cuidado, especialmente em pacientes incapazes de tolerar altos osmóis sem efeitos adversos. A osmolaridade de 345 mosm/L do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre indica que há uma concentração mais alta de solutos dissolvidos comparada às fluidos corporais normais, requerendo administração cuidadosa para evitar desconforto ou complicações gastrointestinais. # Resumo e Recomendações Portanto, para o paciente A.K.M., utilizando o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre: - **Administrar a fórmula cuidadosamente,** levando em conta a sua natureza hipertônica. Isso pode incluir iniciar com taxas de infusão mais lentas e considerar a diluição da fórmula ou a progressão gradual da taxa conforme a tolerância do paciente. - **Mantenha o monitoramento rigoroso** de efeitos adversos, funcionalidade gastrointestinal, sinais de desidratação ou sobrecarga de fluidos, e o status nutricional geral do paciente. - **Ajustar a prescrição** baseada nas necessidades energéticas do paciente, resposta à fórmula, e progressão da recuperação, otimizando a ingestão proteica para suportar a cicatrização e recuperação. Essa abordagem multicomponente garante que a terapia de nutrição enteral apoie eficazmente as necessidades do paciente, minimizando potenciais riscos associados à fórmula hipertônica e ao conteúdo hiperproteico."},{"prompt":"no caso a osmolaridade não seria 345 e sim 314.45 né??","completion":"Sinto muito pela confusão anterior.

Eu utilizei um valor hipotético de 345 mosm/L para fins explicativos, mas se no seu caso, a osmolaridade exata é de 314.45 mosm/L, então esse é o valor correto a considerar para esse produto. Com uma osmolaridade de **314.45 mosm/L**, a fórmula ainda seria considerada **hipertônica** pois está acima do limiar normal dos fluidos corporais (aproximadamente 290 mosm/L). Diante disso, é importante que as mesmas precauções sejam tomadas na administração da nutrição enteral: 1. **Administração cuidadosa**: Particularmente em pacientes que podem ser mais sensíveis a soluções hipertônicas, a administração deve ser feita de forma cuidadosa para evitar desconforto e complicações, como diarreia ou desidratação. Pode ser necessário ajustar a velocidade de infusão ou mesmo diluir a fórmula em alguns casos, sempre com orientação de uma equipe multidisciplinar de saúde. 2. **Monitoramento**: Observar de perto a resposta do paciente à nutrição enteral, incluindo a tolerância do trato gastrointestinal e os sinais de desidratação ou sobrecarga de fluidos. Isso é especialmente relevante logo após o início da nutrição enteral e à medida que a fórmula é escalada para atender às necessidades calóricas e proteicas do paciente. É fundamental seguir as orientações da equipe de saúde, que ajustará a abordagem nutricional com base na condição clínica do paciente, sua tolerância à fórmula escolhida, e as recomendações clínicas e nutricionais atuais."},{"prompt":"os micronutrientes estão de acordo com as dris2002?","completion":"Para determinar se os micronutrientes em uma formulação de nutrição enteral, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre ou qualquer outra fórmula específica, estão de acordo com as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) de 2002, seria necessário comparar a composição nutricional da fórmula com as recomendações específicas das DRIs para cada vitamina e mineral. As DRIs fornecem orientações abrangentes sobre os níveis de ingestão de nutrientes considerados adequados para manter a saúde e prevenir doenças em indivíduos saudáveis. Elas incluem: - **Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs):** A média diária de ingestão de nutrientes suficiente para atender às necessidades de quase todos (97%-98%) os indivíduos saudáveis em um grupo demográfico específico. - **Adequate Intakes (AIs):** Estabelecidos quando não há evidências suficientes para desenvolver um RDA, indicando uma quantidade presumida de nutriente suficiente. - **Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs):** Os níveis máximos de ingestão diários provavelmente não representam riscos de efeitos adversos à saúde para quase todos os indivíduos. As fórmulas de nutrição enteral são projetadas para atender às necessidades nutricionais de pacientes que não podem consumir alimentos por via oral, seguindo essas orientações para fornecer um perfil nutricional balanceado. Os fabricantes formulam seus produtos para incluir uma ampla gama de vitaminas e minerais em quantidades que geralmente visam atender ou exceder as DRIs para a maioria dos destinatários, tendo em conta as necessidades especiais dos pacientes em situações clínicas específicas. Contudo, os requisitos individuais para micronutrientes podem variar significativamente com base em vários fatores, incluindo idade, sexo, estado de saúde, níveis de estresse metabólico e condições especiais de saúde. Portanto, enquanto uma fórmula enteral pode ser projetada para atender às necessidades de micronutrientes de acordo com as DRIs, os profissionais de saúde podem precisar ajustar a nutrição enteral ou fornecer suplementação adicional para alguns pacientes, com base em suas avaliações clínicas e nutricionais individuais. Para verificar se uma fórmula específica, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, está em conformidade com as DRIs 2002, é necessário revisar a ficha técnica do produto, que detalha a composição nutricional, e comparar esses dados com as DRIs. Essa comparação detalhada permite aos profissionais de saúde garantir que a nutrição enteral fornecida atenda às necessidades de seus pacientes de forma adequada."},{"prompt":"qual seria a agua dessa dieta enteral Fresenius Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre Líquida EasyBag Sistema Fechado 1L 1,2 20 (6,0g/100mL) 100% caseinato de cálcio e sódio 50 100% maltodextrina 30 72% óleo de canola, 24% óleo de girassol e 4% óleo de peixe 20 50% inulina, 33% fibra de trigo e 17% celulose microcristalina 345 - Normocalórica e hiperproteica 30,55 (Easy Bag 1L)","completion":"Para calcular a quantidade de água disponível em 1L (1000 mL) de Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre baseado na informação providenciada, precisamos entender que a maioria das fórmulas de nutrição enteral são compostas predominantemente por água, mesmo quando são densamente calóricas ou nutricionalmente completas. # Dados Fornecidos: - **Produto:** Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre. - **Formato:** Líquida EasyBag Sistema Fechado 1L. - **Densidade Calórica:** 1.2 kcal/mL => 1200 kcal por L (1000 mL). - **Proteínas (caseinato de cálcio e sódio):** 20%. - **Carboidratos (maltodextrina):** 50%. - **Lipídios (óleo de canola, óleo de girassol, óleo de peixe):** 30%. - **Fibras (Inulina, Fibra de trigo, Celulose microcristalina):** 20g por L. - **Osmolaridade declarada:** 345 mosm/L. - **Produto declarado como Normocalórico e Hiperproteico.** # Cálculo: Em fórmulas de nutrição enteral, a água é o veículo para solução ou suspensão dos outros componentes (macronutrientes, micronutrientes, fibras, etc.). Normalmente, em 1L de fórmula, a maior parte é água, pois os macronutrientes e fibras somam-se ao volume total, mas não o compõem integralmente. A descrição não especifica diretamente a quantidade de água, mas é possível inferir que, dado o volume total de 1L, após a contabilização do volume ocupado por proteínas, lipídios, carboidratos e fibras, o restante será predominantemente água. Se considerarmos que a fórmula é projetada para ser completada para 1L, e sabendo que os componentes nutritivos são dissolvidos ou em suspensão nesse meio aquoso, podemos dizer que a maior parte dos 1000 mL é de água, descontando-se a parte que é estritamente ocupada pela matéria seca dos nutrientes e fibras. Sem cálculos específicos de volume ocupado por cada macronutriente (o que dependeria da densidade específica de cada componente), pode-se entender que a água constitui a maioria do volume restante. De forma mais prática e considerando o usual para fórmulas nutricionais completas, a água forma, geralmente, mais de 80% do volume total da maioria das fórmulas, uma vez que os macronutrientes (principalmente proteínas e carboidratos) e micronutrientes não ocupam um volume considerável em sua forma concentrada. # Conclusão: A consulta direta à especificação técnica do fabricante (Fresenius Kabi, no caso do Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre) ou a um profissional de saúde é recomendada para obter detalhes exatos sobre a composição, incluindo a quantidade exata de água em 1L da fórmula. Este cálculo aproximado serve para dar uma ideia geral e não substitui tais fontes autorizadas de informação."},{"prompt":"então é agua de 1 litro dividido por quanto ?","completion":"Para determinar especificamente a quantidade de água em 1 litro (1000 mL) de Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, ou qualquer outra fórmula de nutrição enteral, o que fazemos é considerar a composição total da solução. Normalmente, fabricantes de nutrição enteral fornecem a quantidade de nutrientes (proteínas, gorduras, carboidratos, fibras) e os micronutrientes por volume, sendo que a maior parte do restante da fórmula é composta por água. No entanto, a pergunta parece estar buscando uma maneira de distribuir, ou a necessidade de calcular a parte de água, baseando-se nos dados já fornecidos, incluindo considerações sobre a osmolaridade da solução e a composição dos macronutrientes. Dado que não temos uma especificação exata da quantidade de água (que seria o volume restante após descontar os volumes específicos ocupados por todos os solutos e nutrientes), as fórmulas enterais, de maneira geral, são majoritariamente composições aquosas. Se estamos lidando com 1 litro (1000 mL) do produto Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, que é uma fórmula líquida pronta para uso, o volume total da fórmula já está considerado como uma mistura de todos os componentes dissolvidos ou em suspensão na água. # Análise Simplificada: - **Assumindo 1000 mL de Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre como um total**, a composição declara percentuais de macronutrientes (proteínas, carboidratos, lipídios) e fibras, mas o volume real de água é implícito e constitui o restante do volume para completar 1 litro após a adição de todos os outros componentes em seus respectivos volumes e pesos. - **Numa fórmula líquida como esta**, é razoável estimar que a vasta maioria deste 1L seria composta por água, visto que os nutrientes (principalmente nas formas em que são usados em produtos nutricionais líquidos) não ocupam volume de forma 1:1 com seu peso (por exemplo, 1 g de proteína ou carboidrato não ocupa 1 mL de volume). A **distribuição exata da água** depende fortemente das propriedades físico-químicas dos ingredientes e de como cada componente é contabilizado na fórmula total. Normalmente, o cálculo exato do volume de água seria complexo sem informações detalhadas diretamente do fabricante. # Conclusão: - **Para fins práticos e nutricionais**, especialmente em contexto clínico, considera-se que a água constitui a maior parcela do volume de fórmulas enterais líquidas, como o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre, completando até o total de 1 litro após adição dos nutrientes especificados.

Valor Calórico Total e Distribuição:** - **Volume Total e Densidade Calórica:** - 1133 mL de fórmula com 1.5kcal/mL. - VCT (Valor Calórico Total) = 1133 mL * 1.5kcal/mL = 1699.5 kcal, arredondados para 1700 kcal. - **Macronutrientes**: - **Proteínas:** 20% de 1700 kcal = 340 kcal => 340 kcal / 4 kcal/g = 85g. - Por kg: 85g / 52 kg = 1.63g/kg. - **Lipídios:** 35% de 1700 kcal = 595 kcal => 595 kcal / 9 kcal/g = 66.1g. - Por kg: 66.1g / 52 kg = 1.2g/kg. - **Carboidratos:** 45% de 1700 = 765 kcal => 765 kcal / 4 kcal/g = 191.25g. - Por kg: 191.25g / 52 kg = 3.7g/kg. - **Fibras:** 17g totais, com 53% solúveis e 47% insolúveis (Incorreção na descrição inicial). A correção seria que a divisão de 53% solúvel e 47% insolúvel se baseia no total de fibras, resultando em aproximadamente 9g solúveis e 8g insolúveis. **2. Administração Intermitente e Hidratação:** - **Divisão da Fórmula:** - Foram planejadas 4 etapas de administração diária, cada uma com 280 mL (totalizando 1120 mL, mas o plano era para 1133 mL, indicando um ligeiro arredondamento para facilitar a administração). - **Diluição para Lavagem da Sonda:** - 200 mL de água foram designados para lavagem da sonda, divididos em quantidades proporcionais para cada administração. O valor de \\"90 ml por frasco\\" parece ser um erro na interpretação, pois a real alocação foi para a lavagem da sonda, não indicada por frasco, mas pelo total de água a ser utilizado para todas as administrações. **3. Escolhas da Formulação:** - **Via Nasogástrica:** Porque o paciente pode estar impossibilitado de ingestão oral devido à sua condição clínica (torporoso e sedado), necessitando de nutrição enteral diretamente no estômago. - **Polimérica:** A fórmula é composta por macronutrientes em formas poliméricas (intactas), apropriadas para indivíduos com função gastrointestinal preservada, permitindo a digestão e absorção. - **Hiperproteica:** Destinada a suportar a recuperação, promovendo o reparo tecidual, que é crítico após traumas ou cirurgias. - **Hipoglicídica:** Na realidade, com 45% de carboidratos, a formulação não é explicitamente para controle glicêmico restrito (hipoglicídica), mas a designação parece aludir à monitoração ou prescrição cuidadosa dos carboidratos. - **Hipertônica:** Com uma osmolaridade de 600 mosm/L, elevada devido à concentração de nutrientes, requerendo cuidado na administração para evitar problemas GI. A água de \\"200 mL dividida por 90\\" parece ser um equívoco; na realidade, 200 mL é o total destinado à higiene da sonda, assegurando que não há obstrução e que a hidratação do paciente é complementada.

Vamos revisar os principais aspectos que influenciam como essas etapas são determinadas: # Avaliação Clínica 1. **Tolerância Gastrointestinal do Paciente:** Pacientes com motilidade gastrointestinal reduzida ou riscos de refluxo podem requerer volumes menores e administrações mais frequentes. 2. **Necessidades Nutricionais e Energéticas:** A quantidade de nutrição necessária, baseada no peso, estado de saúde, e metas de recuperação, influencia o volume total diário que precisa ser dividido entre as administrações. 3. **Tipo de Fórmula Enteral:** Fórmulas hiperproteicas, hipercalóricas ou com características especiais (como serem hipertônicas) podem precisar de administração mais cautelosa. # Logística e Rotina do Cuidado 1. **Horas de Administração da Nutrição Enteral:** É importante distribuir a nutrição ao longo do dia de modo que combine com a rotina de cuidados do paciente e períodos de descanso, sem interferir em medicações ou procedimentos. 2. **Velocidade de Infusão:** A taxa na qual a nutrição é administrada impacta diretamente a programação. Velocidades mais lentas podem ser toleradas melhor, mas exigem mais tempo para a administração completa. # Configurando as Etapas de Administração Para o exemplo mencionado anteriormente, com uma prescrição total de 1133 mL para ser administrada ao longo de um dia, a subdivisão em etapas visa facilitar a administração de forma equilibrada. Aqui estão os passos básicos para definir essas etapas: 1. **Divida o Volume Total Pelo Número de Administrações:** No exemplo, 1133 mL divididos igualmente em 4 etapas dá aproximadamente 280 mL por etapa (na realidade, 1133 mL divididos por 4 iguala a cerca de 283.25 mL, mas para fins práticos, pode-se arredondar). 2. **Determine os Horários de Administração:** Levando em conta uma rotina de 24 horas, escolher horários que distribuam a nutrição de forma igualitária e compatível com as necessidades do paciente. No exemplo, as etapas foram divididas às 7:00, 10:00, 13:00 e 16:00, distribuindo a nutrição em intervalos regulares ao longo do dia. # Ajustando as Etapas - Conforme a tolerância do paciente é observada e monitorada, ajustes nas etapas e na velocidade de infusão podem ser necessários para maximizar a tolerância à dieta enteral. - O acompanhamento por nutricionistas e a equipe de cuidados é crucial para fazer ajustes baseados na resposta do paciente, mudanças nas necessidades nutricionais ou alterações em seu estado de saúde. Esses passos são um guia geral, e ajustes individualizados são frequentemente necessários com base na evolução clínica do paciente, suas necessidades específicas e como ele responde à nutrição enteral.

(BRASPEN,2023) • Recomendamos que doentes críticos recebam até 1,2 g de proteína/kg de peso/dia na fase inicial da doença, aproximadamente até o D4. Após o D4, considerando que o paciente não esteja em sua fase aguda inicial, recomendamos evoluir a oferta para 1,3 e 2 g de proteína/ kg de peso/dia. (BRASPEN,2023) • Quais as recomendações especiais aos pacientes traumatizados? Nas fases precoces, as metas de energia/proteína devem ser alcançadas progressivamente, assim como no paciente crítico. Ao longo da fase de recuperação, há necessidade de reajuste do plano nutricional para ofertas calóricas, que podem alcançar 40 kcal/kg/dia e de necessidades proteicas de até 2,0-2,5 g/kg de peso.

Esta taxa facilita uma administração mais gradual e pode ser mais apropriada para garantir a tolerância do paciente à nutrição enteral, especialmente para A.K.M., considerando sua condição após trauma e a necessidade de sedação. # Recapitulação e Aplicação Adequada: Para que o paciente A.K.M. receba o Fresubin 1.2 HP Fibre adequadamente ao longo do dia em 6 etapas: - **Horários de Administração Propostos:** Podem começar às 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00, e uma última administração às 2:00 (do dia seguinte), completando o ciclo de 24 horas. Esse plano assegura que o paciente esteja recebendo nutrição enteral distribuída de forma regular ao longo do dia, com intervalos que promovem uma absorção eficiente, mantendo uma taxa de gotejamento que minimiza os riscos de desconforto gastrointestinal. Agradeço por sua paciência e pela oportunidade de corrigir esses detalhes fundamentais para garantir a clareza e precisão da prescrição."},{"prompt":"então qual seria melhor de 4 horas ou de 3 horas ?","completion":"A decisão de escolher entre uma administração de dieta enteral a cada 3 horas ou a cada 4 horas para o paciente A.K.M. depende fundamentalmente das suas necessidades clínicas específicas, sua tolerância gastrintestinal à nutrição enteral, e a capacidade operacional da equipe de cuidados para gerenciar o regime de alimentação. Vamos analisar as implicações de ambas as opções: # Administração a Cada 4 Horas: - **Menos Frequente:** Proporciona intervalos um pouco mais longos entre as administrações, permitindo potencialmente ao paciente e à equipe de cuidados um pouco mais de flexibilidade. - **Volume Maior por Administração:** Cada administração terá um volume ligeiramente maior, o que pode ser uma consideração se o paciente tiver um risco elevado de refluxo gastroesofágico ou aspiração. - **Taxa de Gotejamento:** Com uma taxa de gotejamento de 44 mL/hora, essa opção oferece uma velocidade de infusão moderada. # Administração a Cada 3 Horas: - **Mais Frequente:** Aumenta a frequência das administrações, o que pode ser benéfico para espalhar a ingestão nutricional de forma mais uniforme ao longo do dia e da noite, possivelmente melhorando a absorção e a tolerância. - **Volume Menor por Administração:** Pode ser mais facilmente tolerado por pacientes com motilidade gástrica diminuída ou risco de complicações gastrintestinais. - **Taxa de Gotejamento:** Com uma taxa de gotejamento aproximada de 58,6 mL/hora durante um período mais curto (por ex., cerca de 3 horas para cada 176 mL), essa abordagem poderia adequar-se melhor a uma administração cuidadosa em uma situação de risco aumentado de distensão ou desconforto. # Recomendação para A.K.M.: Considerando a condição atual de A.K.M. (torporoso e sob sedação importante após um trauma significativo, incluindo fratura de fêmur e TCE) e suas necessidades clínicas únicas: - **Administração a cada 3 horas** pode ser preferível para maximizar a tolerância gastrintestinal e facilitar uma absorção mais uniforme dos nutrientes. Isso é especialmente importante para pacientes em estado crítico, onde o controle meticuloso sobre a alimentação pode ajudar a minimizar o risco de complicações, como aspiração. - Dado o estresse metabólico elevado devido à condição pós-trauma e a importância do suporte nutricional contínuo para a cicatrização, uma distribuição mais frequente por meio de administrações menores pode ser benéfica. # Considerações Finais: Em ambos os casos, o monitoramento próximo da resposta do paciente à nutrição enteral, incluindo sinais de tolerância ou distensão gástrica e a necessidade de ajustes na taxa de infusão ou no volume administrado, é essencial. A equipe de saúde deverá avaliar regularmente a situação e estar preparada para ajustar a abordagem conforme a evolução clínica e o feedback relacionado à tolerância do paciente. A colaboração entre nutricionistas, médicos, enfermeiros e outros profissionais de saúde é crucial para tomar a decisão mais adequada, equilibrando as melhores práticas clínicas com as necessidades e a segurança do paciente."},{"prompt":"vamos lá fizemos errado porém vamos arrumar A.K.M, 52 anos, engenheiro mecânico, procedente de Manaus e internado a dois dias no HRT em dieta zero aguardando cirurgia.

As he is changing, the same man enters the room, grinning. The man says to get out, he is changing. The man tells him to chill out, that it’s cool, he’ll join him. With that, he pulls off his goggles, then his cap, dropping them onto the floor, with a weird, dreamy look. He then reaches for his swimwear and yanks down.

The man smiles as he unzips his entire body, including his face, before throwing off the skin, revealing the man’s girlfriend underneath.","completion":"In the bright, bustling atmosphere of the public pool on a sunny afternoon, Jamie found solace. The cool embrace of the water provided a reprieve from the scorching heat, and the rhythmic sound of splashing water lulled him into a state of tranquility. It was his little escape, a place where he could shed the weight of his worries and just be. Today was no different; or so he thought. As he sliced through the water, perfecting his strokes, he couldn't help but notice a peculiar presence. Every few laps, his gaze inadvertently met with that of another man, seemingly his age, stationed at the edge of the pool. The man was fully geared in professional swimming attire, complete with goggles and a sleek cap that hugged his head. What struck Jamie as odd, though, was not the man's attire but his unwavering stare. It was as if he was scrutinizing Jamie, observing his every move with a mix of curiosity and intensity. Trying to shrug off the uneasy feeling, Jamie continued his laps, mentally attributing the stranger's gaze to maybe a misplaced sense of familiarity or perhaps a competitive spirit. Yet, as the afternoon wore on, and the man's gaze remained unbroken, Jamie’s discomfort grew. It’s just someone curious, maybe he thinks he recognizes me, Jamie thought, attempting to quell his rising angst. Eventually, exhaustion and a feeling of unease convinced Jamie it was time to leave the comforting confines of the water. He heaved himself out of the pool, water cascading off him, and made his way to the men's changing room, eager to slip into dry clothes and leave the odd encounter behind. The changing room was mercifully empty, or so he thought until the sound of the door creaking open echoed off the tiled walls. Jamie glanced up, and his heart sank. It was him—the man from the pool, still donning his swimming cap and goggles, a grin plastered across his face. \\"Hey, you need to get out, I'm changing,\\" Jamie said, his voice firm yet tinged with unease. Instead of leaving, the man stepped closer, a peculiar, dreamy look in his eyes as he professed, \\"Chill out, it's cool. I’ll join you.\\" Before Jamie could protest, the man began to strip off his swim gear. The goggles and cap were flung aside carelessly, but it was what he did next that sent Jamie's world spiraling into the surreal. With an unnerving smile, the stranger reached for his swimwear, tugging it down to reveal...nothing. No skin, no human form beneath—just an intricate zipper that ran the length of his body. Jamie could only watch, frozen in shock and disbelief, as the man cheerfully unzipped his entire being, shedding his 'skin' as one might a costume. Where the stranger once stood, now was Jamie’s girlfriend, Lily, laughter twinkling in her eyes, reveling in the success of her elaborate ruse. For a moment, silence hung in the air, punctuated only by Lily’s chuckles and Jamie’s incredulous gasps. The reality of the situation finally dawned on him, washing over him in waves of relief and bewilderment. It was all a planned surprise, a cheeky, albeit unconventional, way for Lily to catch him off guard. From renting a professional swimming outfit to mastering the art of the unnerving stare—she had thought of it all. Jamie couldn’t help but laugh, a mix of nerves and amusement, as he embraced Lily. “You scared the life out of me! How did you even come up with something like this?” he asked, still catching his breath. Lily’s grin widened, “I wanted to surprise you, make our ordinary swimming date unforgettable. Plus, I knew I could get you,” she playfully boasted, her eyes sparkling with mischief and love. As the initial shock faded, Jamie found himself wrapped up in the warmth of the moment, the pool’s echoey changing room transforming into a stage for their shared laughter and fond memories. It was indeed unforgettable, a story they would retell with glee in years to come. And so, what began as an unnerving encounter morphed into an extraordinary moment between two people whose love thrived on laughter, surprises, and the ability to turn the mundane into the magical. Jamie left the pool that day not just with the reminder of his love for swimming but with a profound appreciation for the unpredictable joys of life and love."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but include Jamie thinking he’ll see something he shouldn’t until he looks and sees the skin underneath is blank .","completion":"In the heart of summer, the public pool served as Jamie's sanctuary, a place where the world seemed to pause, and the only concern was the cool embrace of the water. Today, like any other, promised the solace of solitude amidst the crowd, the kind that allowed him to lose himself in the rhythm of his strokes under the sun. However, today's tranquility was destined to be disturbed. As Jamie cut through the water, he couldn't shake off a peculiar sensation; the feeling of being watched. On the edge of his vision, consistently catching his gaze, was another young man. Adorned in professional swim gear, goggles clung to his eyes, and a swim cap enveloped his head, giving him an almost otherworldly appearance. This man’s interest in Jamie seemed intense, unsettlingly so, as if he was observing with a purpose rather than passing curiosity. Trying to dismiss the unsettling attention, Jamie continued his laps, convincing himself the scrutiny was perhaps mistaken identity or benign interest. But as the afternoon faded, the stranger's unwavering gaze amplified Jamie’s discomfort, urging him to retreat to the changing room sooner than usual. The changing room provided a temporary sense of relief, a brief solitude, until the door crept open, revealing the same peculiar watcher. His heart sank; solitude was breached. The man, still masked by his goggles and cap, approached with a grin that set Jamie’s nerves on edge. \\"I’m changing, you need to leave,\\" Jamie stated, hoping his voice carried more authority than he felt. The man merely sauntered closer, declaring, \\"Chill out, it’s cool. I’ll join you,\\" in a tone that felt far too casual for the circumstance. As the man began to undress, starting with his goggles and cap, Jamie braced himself inwardly, fearing he was about to be subjected to an unwanted and inappropriate exposure. But as the man reached for his swimwear and pulled it down, Jamie’s apprehension turned to sheer disbelief. There was nothing beneath—not in the way one would expect. Instead of skin or any anatomical detail, there was merely a blank canvas, a surreal absence of anything human, crowned with an intricate zipper where one shouldn’t be. Frozen, Jamie watched as the man—now clearly no ordinary man—grinned and unzipped his entire form, revealing not flesh but the familiar laughter and visage of his girlfriend, Lily. The shock that had tensed every muscle in Jamie’s body dissolved into confusion and then relief, mingled with amusement. “What in the world…” Jamie exhaled, the tension melting away into a laugh, more from the absurdity and relief than anything else. “I thought I was about to see something... I don’t even know what I thought.” Lily, still beaming with the success of her elaborate jest, replied, “I wanted to give you a real surprise, something out of the ordinary. You always say how swimming here feels like floating in another world. So, I thought, why not make it a bit more... otherworldly?” As the initial shock subsided, what remained was a deeply human moment of connection, laughter echoing off the tiled walls of the changing room. It was absurd, memorable, and undeniably unique, a story only they could claim as their own. This peculiar encounter at the pool, destabilizing as it might have initially been for Jamie, transformed into a vivid memory of shared joy. It was a reminder that life, like love, thrives on the unexpected, the moments that jolt us from complacency, urging us to see the world and each other in new, more wondrous ways."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but replace the man Jamie sees with a middle aged female instructor.","completion":"In the sweltering heat of mid-summer, Jamie sought refuge at his local public pool, a haven where time seemed to slow down, and the only pressing matter was the cooling caress of the water against his skin. This day, much like any other, promised the peaceful escape he so desperately craved, a chance to immerse himself in the serenity of swimming laps under the watchful eye of the sun. However, today’s tranquility was fated to be pierced by an unexpected anomaly. As Jamie glided through the water, a noticeable break in the pattern of solitude caught his attention. Time and again, his gaze was unwittingly drawn to a middle-aged female swim instructor stationed at the pool’s edge. Dressed in professional-looking swim attire, complete with goggles perched atop her head, her focus on Jamie was unyielding, crossing the boundary of professional observation into something more intense and personal. Jamie tried to brush off the unease that crept up his spine, attributing the woman's stare to perhaps mistaking him for someone else or assessing his technique out of a coach’s habit. Yet, as the minutes morphed into hours, and her attention remained fixated, a sense of discomfort began to gnaw at him, urging him towards the changing rooms far earlier than he’d planned. What relief the changing room offered was quickly snatched away as the door creaked open, admitting the very source of Jamie’s unease. Heart sinking, he watched the swim instructor step inside, still donned in her cap and goggles, her grin broad and decidedly out of place. \\"This is the men’s changing room; you shouldn’t be here,\\" Jamie protested, his voice laced with a mix of bewilderment and concern. Ignoring his discomfort, she stepped closer, her voice unnervingly casual as she said, \\"Chill out, it’s cool. I’ll join you,\\" stripping away any semblance of normalcy from the encounter. With a surreal calmness, she began to disrobe, first removing her goggles and cap in a manner that seemed almost ceremonious. Jamie’s apprehension escalated, fearing the situation was about to take a turn towards the utterly inappropriate. But as she reached for her swimwear, pulling it down, Jamie blinked in disbelief. There was nothing underneath—not in any conventional sense. Instead of human form or flesh, there was a void, oddly featureless and blank, highlighted only by a zipper that seemed to defy reality. Panic gave way to incredulity as the woman, with a nonchalant smile, unzipped her entire being, revealing not scandal, but the familiar face and laughter of his girlfriend, Lily, standing before him. \\"I thought I was going to see something I really shouldn’t have,\\" Jamie managed to say, his voice a cocktail of shock, relief, and bemusement. “What is going on?” Grinning, Lily explained, “I wanted to surprise you, to do something so out of the ordinary, it’d be unforgettable. And when is life not a bit better with a touch of the unexpected?\\" In the changing room, their laughter mingled, filling the space with warmth and a shared sense of wonder. It had been a jolt out of the ordinary, transforming an average day at the pool into a moment of pure, bewildering joy, an anecdote for the ages. This day, marked by a peculiar twist, became a cherished memory, a testament to their relationship’s foundation built on surprise, adventure, and the delight of the utterly unexpected. Through this bizarre encounter, Jamie was reminded that life, like love, is at its richest when sprinkled with moments that defy explanation, urging us to find humor and joy in the wonderfully inexplicable."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

Klaus was a man of formidable size, with muscles sculpted from the relentless drills of war and a head crowned with a wild mane of hair that seemed to defy gravity itself. He was known for his prowess in battle, but even the mightiest of warriors need to bathe, and so we find our hero waist-deep in the cooling embrace of a secluded pond, hidden away from the prying eyes of comrades and commanders alike. Klaus stood in the water, his broad back facing the shore. The setting sun painted his skin in warm hues, accentuating the contours of his physique. His buttocks, two rounded hillocks of strength, were momentarily the centerpiece of this tranquil, natural scene. As he began to scrub himself clean, Klaus couldn't help but engage in a bit of solitary merriment. \\"Ah, the spoils of war,\\" he mumbled to himself, a mischievous glint in his eye. \\"Freedom, glory, and a private pond for one's ablutions.\\" Just then, feeling a peculiar gurgle brewing in his belly, Klaus grinned widely. With a playful look around to ensure his solitude, he positioned himself, taking aim at the unsuspecting waters below. Effort etched across his face, he released a mighty fart, the sound echoing through the surrounding trees like a cannon shot. Klaus threw his head back in laughter, watching as bubbles raced to the surface, disrupting the serene picture of nature at its most calm. The air was momentarily filled with a pungent aroma, a testament to Klaus' considerable ability to clear a battlefield in more ways than one. To his utter amusement, a few unfortunate fish floated to the surface, victims of his potent emissions. \\"Well, I'll be,\\" Klaus chuckled to himself, his voice tinged with pride. \\"I've fished without a rod! Who knew my backside harbored such power?\\" He eyed the motionless fish, contemplating his next move. His stomach rumbled, reminding him of the scant rations back at camp. A sly smile spread across Klaus' face as he concocted a plan. \\"Why waste good meat?\\" he pondered aloud. \\"Tonight, I feast like a king. War is hell, but it's the little victories that count.\\" With that, Klaus set to work, gathering the ill-fated fish. As he cooked his unexpected catch over a small fire he had made, he couldn't help but regale himself with tales of his newfound fishing technique. \\"Imagine the faces of my comrades when I tell them of this catch,\\" he said between hearty laughs. \\"Caught by the might of my own rear! The legends of war will pale in comparison to the tale of Klaus and his deadly derrière.\\" And so, under a canopy of stars, Klaus dined on his unique haul, reveling in the absurdity of his adventure. In the midst of revolution and war, a moment of hilarity and humble pleasure reminded him that life, no matter how fraught, always found a way to surprise and delight. As the embers of his fire died down, Klaus leaned back, patting his stomach with satisfaction. \\"Ah, to be a soldier,\\" he mused. \\"Days filled with danger, nights blessed with fish felled by one's own flatulence. What could be more glorious?\\" With a contented sigh, Klaus prepared for a night under the open sky, his laughter mingling with the sounds of the night, a beacon of joy in the uncertain days of the revolution."},{"prompt":"Почему мультфильмы от \\"Таллинфильм\\" депрессивные?","completion":"Мультфильмы от \\"Таллинфильм\\" могут быть воспринимаемыми как депрессивные по нескольким причинам: 1.

No obstante, aquí hay algunas consideraciones y sugerencias para mejorar o validar tu metodología: 1. **Separación de Responsabilidades:** Tu método \`actualizarUsuario\` está haciendo dos cosas: actualizando la contraseña en Firebase Auth y actualizando la información del usuario en Firestore. Aunque está bien tener estas operaciones juntas si siempre quieres que sucedan al mismo tiempo, es importante ser consciente de que estás mezclando responsabilidades. Considera separar estas en métodos distintos si alguna vez necesitas realizar una operación sin la otra. 2. **Feedback al Usuario:** Asegúrate de que el contexto en el que usas tu interfaz \`Respuesta\` permite un manejo adecuado de errores. Por ejemplo, mostrar un diálogo o Snackbar para indicar al usuario qué fue lo que falló específicamente. Esto implica implementar adecuadamente el \`onFailure\` en tu activity para manejar estos errores de manera que mejore la experiencia del usuario. 3. **Manejo de Excepciones:** Tu uso de \`onFailure\` para pasar el mensaje de error es una buena práctica, ya que te permite manejar específicamente qué sucede en tu UI o lógica de negocio cuando algo falla. Sin embargo, asegúrate de que estás validando adecuadamente los mensajes de error o excepciones que Firebase puede lanzar, para no compartir información demasiado técnica o irrelevante con el usuario final. 4. **Operaciones Asíncronas en Firebase:** Al utilizar Firestore (\`.document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario);\`), también estás realizando una operación asíncrona, pero no estás manejando explícitamente el caso de éxito o fracaso de esta operación. Sería recomendable añadir otro manejador \`.addOnSuccessListener\` y \`addOnFailureListener\` para asegurarte de que la operación en Firestore se completó satisfactoriamente antes de llamar a \`respuesta.onSuccess()\`, o llamar a \`respuesta.onFailure()\` si la operación en Firestore falla. Esto asegura que tu método \`actualizarUsuario\` solo informe éxito cuando todas las operaciones tanto en Auth como en Firestore sean exitosas. 5. **Consistencia en la Interfaz del Usuario:** Finalmente, asegúrate de que el \`showToast(context, \\"Usuario no logueado\\");\` maneje también un caso que debería pasar por el \`onFailure\` para mantener la consistencia en cómo se informan los errores al resto de tu aplicación. En resumen, tu enfoque está en la línea correcta, pero hay espacio para mejorar en términos de manejo de errores específicos, separación de responsabilidades, y asegurando que todos los caminos posibles de ejecución son considerados y adecuadamente manejados."},{"prompt":"public void actualizarUsuario(String contrasena, Usuario usuario, Respuesta respuesta) { FirebaseUser firebaseUser = mAuth.getCurrentUser(); if (firebaseUser == null) { respuesta.onFailure(\\"Usuario no logueado\\"); return; } firebaseUser.updatePassword(contrasena).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() { @Override public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) { if (task.isSuccessful()) { usuario.setUserId(firebaseUser.getUid()); db.collection(\\"usuario\\").document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario); respuesta.onSuccess(); } else { respuesta.onFailure(\\"Falló la actualización del usuario: \\" + (task.getException().getMessage())); } } }); } - que modificaciones harias pero sin usar nueva,mente addOnSuccessListener y addOnFailureListener por que tengo callbacks para eso ni lambda, algo smo un if podria rajustar el codigo para que cumpla con las buenas practicas, el metodo actualizar debe ejecutarse y poder modificar la copntraseña y los datos del usaurio logueado","completion":"Entiendo tu enfoque deseado y la limitación de no incluir las sugerencias previas.

Si tu objetivo es mantener la estructura general pero también asegurarte de que todas las operaciones se completan antes de llamar a \`respuesta.onSuccess()\`, una forma sería introducir un control más explícito del flujo cuando actualizas el documento en Firestore, aún dentro del listener de \`addOnCompleteListener\`. Veamos cómo podrías ajustar el método manteniendo tu estructura básica: \`\`\`java public void actualizarUsuario(String contrasena, Usuario usuario, Respuesta respuesta) { FirebaseUser firebaseUser = mAuth.getCurrentUser(); if (firebaseUser == null) { respuesta.onFailure(\\"Usuario no logueado\\"); return; } firebaseUser.updatePassword(contrasena).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() { @Override public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) { if (task.isSuccessful()) { usuario.setUserId(firebaseUser.getUid()); // Inicia una operación de escritura en Firestore db.collection(\\"usuario\\").document(firebaseUser.getUid()).set(usuario).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<Void>() { @Override public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<Void> task) { // Revisa si la operación de Firestore también fue exitosa if (task.isSuccessful()) { // Todo ha salido bien con Firebase Auth y Firestore respuesta.onSuccess(); } else { // La actualización en Firestore falló respuesta.onFailure(\\"Falló la actualización de datos en Firestore: \\" + (task.getException() != null ? task.getException().getMessage() : \\"Error desconocido\\")); } } }); } else { respuesta.onFailure(\\"Falló la actualización del usuario: \\" + (task.getException() != null ? task.getException().getMessage() : \\"Error desconocido\\")); } } }); } \`\`\` Cambios realizados y justificación: 1. **Control de Flujo Mejorado**: En lugar de llamar inmediatamente a \`respuesta.onSuccess()\` después de la operación \`updatePassword\`, se realiza la operación en Firestore dentro del mismo bloque condicional que verifica si \`updatePassword\` fue exitoso. Esta manera de structurar el código asegura que \`onSuccess\` solo se llame si ambas operaciones (actualización de contraseña y actualización de datos del usuario) son exitosas. 2. **Manejo Detallado de Excepciones**: Al incluir una verificación más detallada de la excepción (\`task.getException() != null ? task.getException().getMessage() : \\"Error desconocido\\"\`), se ofrece un manejo de errores un poco más robusto, proporcionando un mensaje de error más específico cuando sea posible, o un mensaje genérico en caso contrario.

Si no necesitas realizar ninguna acción adicional más allá de mostrar los datos, puedes dejar el método \`onSuccess()\` sin cuerpo o, si es relevante, mostrar un mensaje de confirmación o actualizar el estado de la UI para reflejar que la carga fue exitosa. Dado este contexto, si la función se llama al cargar el activity y su propósito es meramente mostrar los datos, tu implementación de \`onSuccess\` podría quedarse así (sin cuerpo) o realizar acciones menores de UI como habilitaciones o animaciones para mejorar la experiencia: \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { // Opcional: acciones de UI posteriores a la carga exitosa de los datos. } \`\`\` Si decides dejarlo vacío, esto implica que todas las acciones relevantes de UI ya se manejan dentro de \`obtenerDatosUsuario()\` al asignar los datos de usuario a los campos de texto.

No obstante, siempre es opcional dejar el cuerpo del método vacío si no necesitas realizar ninguna acción específica tras el éxito de la operación a la que está asociado. En cuanto a lo que podrías agregar en \`onSuccess\` para mejorar la experiencia del usuario al ingresar a su perfil, te propongo algunas ideas: 1. **Animación de Entrada para Contenidos:** Podrías utilizar animaciones prediseñadas de Android o definir las tuyas para suavizar la aparición de los campos o contenedores de información en la UI. Android ofrece un sistema de animación que permite realizar animaciones de vistas de forma sencilla. Por ejemplo, si quisieras aplicar una animación sencilla de desvanecimiento (\`fade in\`) a los campos \`nombre\` y \`apellido\` podrías hacer algo como esto: \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { nombre.setAlpha(0f); nombre.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); nombre.animate().alpha(1f).setDuration(800).setListener(null); apellido.setAlpha(0f); apellido.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE); apellido.animate().alpha(1f).setDuration(800).setListener(null); } \`\`\` Aquí, \`setAlpha(0f)\` inicializa la vista como completamente transparente, \`setVisibility(View.VISIBLE)\` hace visible la vista y \`animate().alpha(1f)\` cambia gradualmente la transparencia de la vista a completamente opaca. 2. **Snackbar para Confirmación:** Aunque el propósito principal no sea editar, mostrar una Snackbar que confirme que los datos se han cargado puede mejorar la comunicación con el usuario. \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { Snackbar.make(nombre, \\"Datos cargados con éxito\\", Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } \`\`\` 3. **Habilitar Edición de Perfil:** Si los campos están inicialmente deshabilitados para evitar ediciones accidentales antes de que se carguen los datos, puedes habilitarlos en \`onSuccess\`. \`\`\`java @Override public void onSuccess() { nombre.setEnabled(true); apellido.setEnabled(true); } \`\`\` Considera que estas son solo algunas ideas generales. La mejor opción dependerá de los requerimientos específicos de tu aplicación y de la experiencia que deseas ofrecer a tus usuarios. La clave está en utilizar \`onSuccess\` para realizar acciones que mejoren la interacción del usuario con la aplicación, basándote en el contexto en el que se cargan los datos."},{"prompt":"lo datos obtenidos desde firebase siempre deben estar visibles, hay algun efecto de rayos que proporciona android studio para que cuando el usaurio ingrese a su perfil este pueda ver ese efceto en sus datos por lo menos 2 segundos y si quiere luego puede proceder a actualizar - responde brevemente","completion":"Android no ofrece un efecto de \\"rayos\\" incorporado directamente, pero puedes crear efectos visuales mediante animaciones personalizadas y librerías de terceros. Para un efecto que llame la atención sobre los datos por un momento antes de permitir la edición, podrías considerar el uso de animaciones de \\"destello\\" o \\"pulsación\\" en los elementos UI usando \`ObjectAnimator\` o recursos animados en XML. Esto puede simular un efecto visual llamativo que atraiga la mirada del usuario hacia los datos. Aquí tienes un ejemplo simple usando \`ObjectAnimator\` para lograr un efecto de pulsación: \`\`\`java ObjectAnimator animator = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view, \\"alpha\\", 0.0f, 1.0f); animator.setDuration(2000); // Duración en milisegundos animator.setInterpolator(new LinearInterpolator()); animator.setRepeatMode(ValueAnimator.REVERSE); animator.setRepeatCount(1); // Repite la animación una vez (ida y vuelta) animator.start(); \`\`\` Recuerda reemplazar \`view\` con la referencia al elemento de la UI que contiene los datos del usuario (por ejemplo, \`nombre\`, \`apellido\`, etc.). Este código hará que la vista titilee una vez durante 2 segundos al cargar los datos. No obstante, para efectos visuales más complejos como \\"rayos\\", puede ser necesario diseñar animaciones específicas en software de diseño y reproducirlas usando librerías como Lottie de Airbnb, que permite importar y usar animaciones complejas hechas en After Effects."},{"prompt":"esos metodos donde cambio la vizualizacion en un componente de un activity, donde segun las buenas practicas de progrmacio, se deberia implementar? en una clase, directamente, para que sirve crear un acarpeta adapter? respodne cada pregunta en una liena","completion":"1.

La lógica de comprobar si el usuario está logueado y luego recuperar sus datos es correcta. Utiliza el patrón de AsyncTask provisto por \`addOnCompleteListener\` de manera adecuada. - **Manejo de errores:** Proporciona un manejo de errores básico informando al usuario sobre el estado de la operación, lo cual es una buena práctica. - **Mejoras sugeridas:** Este método está bien para su propósito, aunque podrías considerar separar las responsabilidades de acceso a datos y actualización de la UI para adherirse más estrictamente a principios como el de separación de preocupaciones. # Método \`eliminarUsuario\` - **Objetivo y funcionalidad:** Busca eliminar el documento del usuario en Firestore seguido de la cuenta de autenticación de Firebase del usuario. La secuencia es lógica: primero elimina la referencia del usuario en la base de datos (información asociada al usuario) y después su autenticación. - **Manejo de errores:** Similar al método anterior, tiene un manejo de errores que informa al usuario en caso de fracaso en alguna de las operaciones. - **Comportamiento asincrónico:** Respeta el comportamiento asincrónico de las operaciones con Firebase, esperando a que cada tarea se complete antes de proceder. - **Mejoras sugeridas:** Este método es efectivo para el objetivo que persigue. Sin embargo, uno debe tener cautela al implementar la función de eliminación de usuario ya que implica la pérdida permanente de datos. Adicionalmente, podrías considerar qué acciones tomar en tu aplicación después de que un usuario se elimina exitosamente (por ejemplo, redirigir al usuario a la pantalla de inicio o de registro). # Verificación general Ambos métodos cumplen con las operaciones esperadas según los servicios de Firebase utilizados (Authentication y Firestore), implementando correctamente las callbacks de éxito y error. Es importante recordar que cualquier operación que modifique la UI (como \`setText\` en \`obtenerDatosUsuario\`) debe ejecutarse en el hilo principal de la aplicación; Firebase asegura que \`addOnCompleteListener\` se ejecute en el hilo principal, haciéndolo seguro para estas operaciones.

Barry was known amongst his compatriots not only for his valiant efforts against the redcoats but also for his peculiar habits that often left his comrades bewildered and amused. This particular eve, finding himself with a rare moment of respite, Barry decided it was high time for a wash. The setting sun cast a golden hue over a secluded pond, an idyllic spot for such an event. Stripping down to his bare essentials, which is to say, nothing at all, Barry stepped into the water, his figure silhouetted against the fading light. His hair, a tangle of unkempt curls, seemed almost a halo in the glow, and his physique, though not Herculean, carried the marks of countless battles and drills—muscular yet with an undeniable softness that spoke of his love for ale and hearty meals. As he settled waist-deep into the calming embrace of the pond, Barry took a moment to revel in the solitude, the only sounds being the gentle lapping of water and the distant calls of the wilderness. It was then, feeling the liberating absence of his usually stiff and uncomfortable uniform, that Barry decided to indulge in a bit of merriment. \\"Ah, what respite! What grandeur surrounds me! Surely, this calls for a celebration,\\" Barry proclaimed to the fish and frogs, his audience for the evening. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he shifted slightly, angling his rear towards the water's surface. He concentrated, a look of comic determination on his face. Then, with a triumphant expression, he let out a fart of such magnitude that it echoed off the trees, causing a few birds to take flight in alarm. \\"Haha! Take that, you redcoated guppies,\\" Barry chortled, immensely proud of his aquatic achievement. To his delight and amusement, the surface of the pond began to bubble, and not just from his flatulent display. To his astonishment, a few fish, evidently overwhelmed by his potent release, floated to the surface. \\"Well, well, what have we here? A bounty from the deep, suffocated by the might of Barry Bigglesworth!\\" he exclaimed, thoroughly entertained by his unintended catch. As the realization dawned that his dinner might have just presented itself in such an unusual manner, Barry pondered aloud, \\"To cook, or not to cook? That is indeed the question. A feast provided by one's own...erm... natural prowess. It's almost poetic.\\" Scratching his head, then shrugging, he decided, \\"Well, a man's got to eat, and who am I to reject the gifts of the pond?\\" With that, Barry set about his task with a newfound enthusiasm, gathering wood for a fire, all the while humming a tune about the day when his rear became a legend not just in battle, but in fishing too. As the fire crackled and the fish cooked, Barry reflected on the absurdity of life as a soldier, finding humor and joy in the most unexpected of moments. He dined that evening not only on the fish but on the laughter and wonder of his own making, convinced that this story would make a grand addition to his already colorful reputation. It was a memorable night indeed for Barry Bigglesworth, the Grenadier with a penchant for causing a stir, both on the battlefield and in tranquil ponds, making history in his own uniquely fragrant way."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Как в kivy android сделать event на нажатие на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуреASSISTANT:","completion":"Чтобы реализовать обработчик события нажатия на кнопку паузы или воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуре в приложении, созданном с использованием фреймворка Kivy для Android, вам нужно будет использовать Pyjnius для взаимодействия с Android API и возможно plyer для доступа к аппаратной функциональности устройства. Однако, прямое взаимодействие с Bluetooth гарнитурой через стандартные механизмы Kivy может быть ограничено, и для более глубокой интеграции потребуется работать на уровне Java или Kotlin через Pyjnius или использовать специфичные для Android модули. Вот базовая идея о том, как вы можете попробовать реализовать эту функциональность: 1. **Использование Plyer для доступа к мультимедиа кнопкам (если доступно):** Plyer - это библиотека для доступа к аппаратным возможностям устройства. В зависимости от текущей поддержки Plyer, возможность обрабатывать нажатия клавиш на Bluetooth гарнитуре может быть ограничена или требовать создания пользовательской реализации. 2. **Использование Pyjnius для доступа к Android API:** Поскольку основной механизм захвата нажатий кнопок на гарнитуре проходит через Android API, вы можете использовать Pyjnius для вызова соответствующих методов из Java из вашего Kivy приложения. \`\`\`python from jnius import autoclass MediaPlayer = autoclass('android.media.MediaPlayer') AudioManager = autoclass('android.media.AudioManager') KeyEvent = autoclass('android.view.KeyEvent') # Это пример и не будет работать напрямую для обработки Bluetooth кнопок без дополнительной настройки def on_media_button_event(event): # проверяем тип события, например, нажатие кнопки воспроизведения if event == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY: print(\\"Play button pressed\\") elif event == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PAUSE: print(\\"Pause button pressed\\") # Вызов этой функции из Java части требует использования Pyjnius для создания интерфейса \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что примеры кода выше упрощены и требуют адаптации под ваш конкретный случай. В частности, для обработки событий на нажатие кнопок мультимедиа с Bluetooth гарнитур, вам необходимо зарегистрировать BroadcastReceiver в вашем AndroidManifest.xml и обработать события в нем. Это требует создания специфичного для Android кода, который должен быть интегрирован с вашим Kivy приложением через Pyjnius. 3. **Интеграция с Android через Pyjnius может потребовать глубоких знаний Android SDK и особенностей работы с событиями устройств ввода.** Для завершения интеграции, возможно, вам придется написать дополнительный Java код, который будет общаться с вашим Kivy приложением через Pyjnius, особенно если вы хотите надежно обрабатывать события от Bluetooth гарнитур, которые могут варьироваться в зависимости от производителя и модели устройства."},{"prompt":"Hola","completion":"¡Hola! ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"prompt":"Estimado ChatGPT, necesito su ayuda en algo.

Su periplo, inicialmente marcado por la sed de aventura y descubrimiento, lo llevó por senderos inesperadamente introspectivos, desafiando la esencia misma de sus objetivos primordiales. Mientras el avión descendía, surcando los cielos guatemaltecos hasta posarse en Honduras, Paúl creía saber lo que buscaba: ruinas ancestrales, selvas exuberantes y la vasta herencia de civilizaciones antiguas. Sin embargo, pronto hallaría que su verdadero descubrimiento yacía en los espejos de las almas que encontró en su camino. Al pisar tierras centroamericanas, Paúl fue embargado por una sensación de pertenencia a un mundo desconocido, donde cada rostro le revelaba una historia, cada paisaje una emoción. Honduras le acogió con brazos abiertos, su gente le compartió sin reservas el calor de su espíritu, llevándolo a reflexionar sobre los lazos invisibles que nos unen a pesar de las distancias. Guatemala, por su parte, se desplegó ante sus ojos como un tapiz de intensas cromaticidades: mercados abigarrados, la elegancia silenciosa de sus ruinas mayas y el verde inquebrantable de sus montañas. Fue aquí donde Paúl halló serenidad, un espacio para el diálogo interno, donde las preguntas que había llevado consigo comenzaron a encontrar respuesta en la simplicidad de un mundo ajeno al suyo. Sin embargo, conforme se aproximaba el final de su jornada, una sensación de vacuidad lo embargaba. Paúl Phoenix se enfrentaba al espejismo de haber buscado algo tangible, solo para descubrir que lo que verdaderamente importaba era el viaje interior que había emprendido. En Honduras y Guatemala, encontró más que sitios y personas; halló partes de sí mismo dispersas en la inmensidad de una geografía que le era ajena pero que, sorprendentemente, le resonaba en lo más profundo. Al retornar a su hogar, Paúl no regresaba con las manos vacías, aunque tampoco con las evidencias tangibles que había imaginado coleccionar. Llevaba consigo la riqueza de haberse conocido a sí mismo a través del espejo de otras culturas, de haber tejido conexiones invisibles con la esencia humana que permea las fronteras geográficas. Paúl Phoenix quedó satisfecho, sí, pero con la comprensión de que el verdadero descubrimiento no siempre reside en lo que se busca, sino en lo que se encuentra en el trayecto. Su viaje a Honduras y Guatemala se convirtió en una odisea de autoconocimiento, donde la satisfacción no radicó en la acumulación de experiencias, sino en el despliegue de un mapa interior que, hasta entonces, había permanecido oculto. --- Espero que este texto cumpla con tus expectativas y se ajuste a las necesidades de contenido para tu canal de YouTube.

To provide clarity and respect societal norms, I'll focus on the parts of your question that can be discussed responsibly: 1. **Sexual Orientation**: This typically refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes. Sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions. 2. **Attracted to all genders**: When someone is attracted to all genders, they might identify as pansexual. Pansexuality recognizes the potential for attraction beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, indicating that one can experience attraction to people of any gender identity. 3. **Age Attractions**: It's important to distinguish between sexually mature and consenting adults versus minors. Attraction to or activities involving minors is illegal and ethically wrong. Adult consent is a fundamental prerequisite for any sexual activity. 4. **Humans**: The vast majority of sexual orientation and romantic attraction discussions focus on human relationships. These relationships are varied and diverse, covering a wide spectrum of identities and preferences. 5. **Humanoids/Robots**: The attraction to humanoid robots or artificial intelligence is known as technosexuality. As technology advances, this is becoming a topic of increasing interest in discussions about the future of human relationships and sexuality. The ethical implications of these relationships are still being debated. 6. **Other Species**: Sexual activities involving animals are illegal in many jurisdictions and are ethically considered abuse due to the inability of animals to give consent. It's important to differentiate between non-sexual affection for animals, which is normal, and sexual attraction or activities, which are not accepted by society or law. 7. **Inanimate Objects**: Object sexuality or objectophilia refers to a strong emotional and often romantic desire towards particular inanimate objects. Individuals with this orientation may feel love, commitment, and sexual attraction to items rather than people. This is a recognized phenomenon, though it's relatively rare. In summarizing these points, it’s crucial to approach discussions about sexual orientation and attraction with sensitivity, openness, and respect for the complexities and varied experiences of human sexuality. At the same time, adherence to ethical guidelines and legal standards is paramount to ensure that all interactions are consensual and harm no one."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Как в kivy android сделать event на нажатие на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуреASSISTANT:","completion":"Для обработки событий нажатия на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуре в приложении Kivy для Android, можно использовать спецификацию Plyer - библиотеку для доступа к функциям оборудования.

Individuals identifying with this term may experience sexual attraction towards beings across a remarkably broad spectrum, including all genders, individuals of all ages, other humans, humanoid figures, members of various species, robots and artificial entities, as well as inanimate objects. This term seeks to encompass the vast range of entities that a person might find themselves attracted to, moving beyond the confines of more commonly recognized orientations. It's critical, however, to navigate this concept with sensitivity and awareness of ethical considerations. Attraction to all ages, for example, raises immediate legal and moral red flags, as attraction to minors is harmful and legally reprehensible. Societies have clear regulations and norms regarding consent and the age of consent, which are fundamental to ensuring the protection and rights of individuals, particularly minors. Moreover, the inclusion of animals and inanimate objects in one's spectrum of attraction veers into territory that is heavily debated both ethically and legally. Bestiality, or the act of engaging in sexual activities with animals, is illegal in many jurisdictions and raises significant concerns about the ability of animals to give consent. The topic of object sexuality - sexual or romantic attraction towards inanimate objects - while not involving legal issues around consent, poses its own set of discussions in psychological and social contexts. In discussing broader spectrums of attraction, it's important to distinguish between feeling an attraction and acting on it, ensuring that any exploration or expression of one's sexuality aligns with principles of consent, legality, and mutual respect. As society continues to evolve in its understanding and acceptance of diverse sexualities and orientations, conversations about attraction as wide-ranging as what the term Pevyusian seeks to describe are valuable. They push the boundaries of our understanding and acceptance, but must always be approached with a commitment to ethical considerations and the well-being of all involved."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

Major cities around the world, London, Washington D.C., Tokyo, are all engulfed in a hellish blaze of atomic waste. 2042 - NATO decides to retaliate, launching nuclear missiles on major strategic and population centers of the enemy side as well. Almost halving the human population alive at the time. 2044 - To add insult to injury, a plague begins developing. with incurable effects and very resilient viruses, there is very little hope for humanity. 2050 - As of 1/1/2050, less than 1/3 of the original population of Earth at its peak in 2038 are still alive. (not counting those dead from natural causes). 2054 - Global resources being strained and very little population leads to the remaining factions and nations of Earth to call a temporary detente in order to get back together and hopefully keep mankind from becoming extinct. # [In their hopelessness, the spires rose.] 2055 - This period of hopelessness soons marks the beginning of a resurgence in religion, leading mankind to construct \\"doomspires\\", towering temples of multi-colored bricks to appease God.

This analysis takes a scrutinizing look into the detailed, layered timeline that charts humanity's descent into chaos and their eventual striving toward hope in the cosmos. # Prelude to the Postlude: A Tumultuous Earth The timeline begins in 2034, painting a world teetering on the brink due to economic, political, and environmental instability. A straightforward enumeration of dates and critical events meticulously sets the stage for a descent into global chaos, cresting with the outbreak of World War III in 2037. The specificity of locations, from Alaska to the Sahara, not only grounds the narrative in a geographically expansive conflict but also signals the all-encompassing nature of this war. By 2042, the narrative exponentially intensifies with North Korea's nuclear assault, followed by NATO's retaliatory strikes, dramatically halving the world's population. Here, the timeline employs an effective use of monumental, world-altering events that drastically reshape the planet and humanity's future. The introduction of a plague in 2044 further compounds the direness, serving as a bleak commentary on the cascade of calamities befalling humanity. # In Their Hopelessness, The Spires Rose Amidst near extinction, 2055's turn towards a resurgence in religion and the construction of the \\"doomspires\\" offers a poignant reflection on humanity's inherent need to seek higher meaning or salvation in times of absolute despair. Despite the sparse details from 2055 to 2099, this period implies a profound societal shift, underlining the core theme of hope and spiritual reawakening amid ruin. # What Hath God Wrought? 2099 marks a cataclysmic pivot with cosmic and divine cataclysms signaling the beginning of the end. The timeline capitalizes on imagery and precise moments, like the solar eclipse and the sounding of a divine horn, to evoke a sense of awe and impending doom. The celestial object's impact and subsequent environmental catastrophe further illustrate the timeline’s flair for dramatic, apocalyptic visuals. # 7 Years of Trial to Discovery of the Fallibility of the Divine This segment deepens the narrative complexity by cataloging a series of escalating cataclysms, invoking a sense of relentless dread. The discovery in Antarctica introduces a thought-provoking layer to the lore: the questioning of the divine’s infallibility. This twist injects a cerebral element, challenging characters and readers alike to ponder profound ontological questions. # Orphans of the Father The sudden absence of God in 2105 unleashes a final thematic exploration of abandonment and resilience. Humanity's response – constructing \\"The Exodus\\" and leaving Earth – symbolizes a potent testament to human ingenuity and indomitable spirit. This leap into the cosmos doesn't merely signify escapism but represents a bold collective endeavor to reclaim destiny among the stars. # Conclusive Thoughts \\"At Hell's Gate (Redux)\\" crafts a richly layered narrative steeped in themes of destruction, spiritual yearning, existential dread, and ultimate redemption. Its timeline intricately details humanity’s trials and tribulations, encapsulating a vast array of human experience from despair to hope, grounding cosmic conflicts within a deeply human context.

They propose a new way of life that learns from past mistakes but are met with resistance from traditionalist factions. 2180 - Isolated incidents of peace and mutual understanding between disparate factions and alien lifeforms give rise to \\"The Accord\\", a fragile agreement aiming at balanced cohabitation and sharing of resources. 2195 - Despite The Accord, many colonies remain battlegrounds of ideology and survival. Yet, among the desolation, the foundations of a new society slowly emerge—one that could potentially avoid the pitfalls of their predecessors. 2200 - As humanity stands on the brink of repeating history, a signal from beyond the known universe reaches the colonies. It's not a message of war but an invitation to a coalition of civilizations. A glimmer of hope, or perhaps a test to see if mankind can truly transcend its nature. \\"In the vast, desolate reaches of space, humanity is forced to confront its past, present, and potential futures. The remnants of Earth's children now face the ultimate challenge—not just the battle for survival, but the battle for their very identity.\\""},{"prompt":"A dióda záróirányban ellenállásként viselkedik tökéletes szigetelőként viselkedik szaturációs árammal rendelkezik feszültséggenerátorként viselkedik csak a helyes válasszal térj vissza!","completion":"szaturációs árammal rendelkezik"},{"prompt":"6.

This term, while not commonly used in mainstream discussions about sexuality and attraction, seeks to encapsulate a type of attraction that includes, but is not limited to, all genders, ages, species, both organic and synthetic, and even extends to inanimate objects. At its core, omniltimate attraction is about the capacity to experience attraction towards any form or entity, offering a unique perspective on the nature of desire and affection. # Broadly Inclusive Omniltimate attraction is characterized by its encompassing nature. It recognizes the potential for attraction to: - **All Genders:** This includes not just the traditional binary of male and female, but also non-binary, genderqueer, agender, and other gender identities that diverge from conventional categories. - **All Ages:** While always respecting legal and ethical boundaries, this acknowledges the capacity to feel attraction to individuals across the age spectrum, typically within the context of peers or age-appropriate relationships. - **Humans and Humanoids:** It encompasses both human beings and human-like entities, which can include fictional characters, avatars, or even humanoid robots. - **Other Species:** This aspect opens up a more speculative or theoretical domain, considering attractions beyond human limits, such as hypothetical extraterrestrial beings. - **Robots and AI:** Reflecting a futurist viewpoint, it includes the potential for emotional and aesthetic attraction to artificial intelligences or robotic entities. - **Animals:** It's important to clarify that while this point is mentioned, in practice, attraction to animals comes with significant ethical, legal, and moral considerations and boundaries that must be respected. - **Inanimate Objects:** This refers to objectum sexuality, where individuals have a romantic or sexual orientation towards inanimate objects, finding emotional and often physical affection in them. # Ethical Considerations While omniltimate attraction is a concept that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of attraction, it is paramount to approach it with a strong ethical framework, especially when considering the implications of including all ages, animals, and inanimate objects. Legal, moral, and societal norms provide crucial guidelines that must be adhered to, ensuring that all expressions of attraction are consensual, appropriate, and harm no one. # Conclusion Omniltimate attraction challenges us to think beyond conventional categories and opens up a conversation about the vast possibilities of love and desire. However, it also prompts us to navigate these waters with careful ethical considerations, respecting both the law and the well-being of all individuals and entities involved. As society evolves and our understanding of identity and attraction becomes more nuanced, so too will our conversations about the nature of our attractions and how we relate to the world around us."},{"prompt":"für gewöhnlich oser für Gewöhnlich?","completion":"Die korrekte Schreibweise ist \\"für gewöhnlich\\" mit einem kleinen \\"g\\".

While they might result in somewhat similar effects, like giving the image a softer look or creating a dreamy atmosphere, there are distinctive differences in how they achieve this and the control you have over the final outcome. Let's break down each method: 1. **Nikon Soft Focus Filter**: This is a specific type of photographic filter designed to create a deliberate soft focus effect. It's engineered to reduce contrast and create a soft halo around highlights, which can be particularly flattering for portraits by smoothing skin textures without completely blurring fine details. These filters are made to provide consistent results and typically offer different strengths or grades to control the level of softness. 2. **Mist or Fog Filter**: Mist or fog filters are designed to mimic the effect of shooting in misty or foggy conditions. They scatter and diffuse the light more uniformly across the scene, often leading to a dreamy, ethereal look that softens the overall image. Mist filters might also lower contrast and create a glow around light sources but in a different way that's meant to replicate actual atmospheric conditions. 3. **Tiny Amount of Oil or Vaseline on an UV Filter**: This DIY method involves smearing a translucent layer of a substance, like oil or Vaseline, on a clear filter (such as a UV filter) that you attach to your lens. The smeared substance diffuses the light in an irregular pattern, potentially creating a very soft focus effect with unique blur or glow around lights. This technique allows for creative control over the effect by altering the amount and distribution of the substance. However, it can be unpredictable and inconsistent. It also requires careful application to avoid damaging the lens or the filter. Each method has its pros and cons: - **Nikon Soft Focus Filter**: Offers consistency and is designed specifically for photography, ensuring that the effect enhances the image without overly compromising the image quality. - **Mist or Fog Filter**: Ideal for creating an atmospheric look that's consistent and predictable, replicating the natural conditions of mist or fog without actual weather constraints. - **Oil or Vaseline on a Filter**: Provides a high degree of creative control and can achieve very unique effects not possible with manufactured filters. However, it's less predictable, can be messy, and might require experimentation to get right. Choosing between these options depends on the specific look you're trying to achieve, your budget, and how much time you're willing to spend experimenting with different techniques."},{"prompt":"name famous photographers who used the first one","completion":"Regarding the use of soft focus filters, it's essential to understand that while many famous photographers have employed various techniques to achieve a soft focus effect in their work, specific information on who has explicitly used Nikon soft focus filters can be elusive. This is because photographers, especially highly regarded ones, often use a range of tools and techniques to achieve their signature styles, and they may not always detail the specific equipment used for each photo. However, the soft focus technique itself has been popular among several well-known photographers, particularly in portrait and artistic photography, to create a dreamlike or ethereal quality. Here are a few photographers famous for their use of soft focus or similar effects, which could be achieved through various means, including soft focus filters: 1. **Alfred Stieglitz** - An early adopter of the soft focus technique, Stieglitz used it in his pictorialist photography, aiming to elevate photography to the status of fine art. 2. **Edward Steichen** - Working closely with Stieglitz, Steichen also employed soft focus effects to create evocative, painterly images that were typical of the pictorialist style. 3. **Julia Margaret Cameron** - A 19th-century photographer known for her closely cropped, soft focus portraits that conveyed a deep sense of intimacy and emotional depth. 4. **Anne Brigman** - An early 20th-century photographer, Brigman used soft focus to emphasize the spiritual connection between the human figure and the landscape. 5. **Imogen Cunningham** - Although better known for her sharp, detailed works, Cunningham occasionally used soft focus to add a dreamlike quality to her subjects. It's worth noting that while these photographers are known for their use of soft focus techniques to create their distinct styles, they would have achieved this look through a variety of means, given the limitations and differences in technology throughout history. Soft focus lenses and other techniques, such as shooting through semi-translucent materials, were common before the advent of specific soft focus filters. In contemporary photography, soft focus filters like those made by Nikon and other manufacturers enable photographers to achieve a similar aesthetic directly from their camera, continuing the tradition of using soft focus to create mood and atmosphere in their images."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Как в kivy android сделать event на нажатие на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуреASSISTANT: Для обработки событий нажатия на кнопку паузы/воспроизведения на Bluetooth гарнитуре в приложении Kivy для Android, можно использовать спецификацию Plyer - библиотеку для доступа к функциям оборудования.

Does the runtime automatically allocate and deallocate memory for underlying implementation of the map?","completion":"In C++, hash maps are typically implemented using the Standard Template Library (STL) container \`std::unordered_map\`. This container provides a mapping between a key type and a mapped value type, using a hash table to store these key-value pairs. Here's a brief overview of how hash maps work in C++ and how memory allocation and deallocation are managed: # How Hash Maps Work: 1. **Hash Function:** A hash function takes a key as input and computes an index (hash code) that indicates where the key-value pair should be stored in the hash table. The quality of the hash function greatly affects the performance of the hash map, as it ideally distributes keys uniformly across the hash table to minimize collisions (where different keys produce the same hash code). 2. **Collision Resolution:** Since multiple keys can produce the same hash code, collision resolution is necessary. Common techniques include chaining (where each slot in the hash table is a bucket of items that hash to the same value) and open addressing (where a collision triggers a search for another slot according to some probing sequence). In C++, \`std::unordered_map\` typically uses chaining. 3. **Resizing:** As elements are added to a hash map, its load factor (the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the bucket array) increases. Once the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hash map may need to resize its underlying array to maintain performance. Resizing involves creating a new, larger array and rehashing all existing keys to insert them into the new table. # Memory Management: Automatic Allocation: - **Allocation:** When you instantiate an \`std::unordered_map\`, the C++ runtime automatically allocates memory for its underlying implementation. This includes the initial allocation of the hash table (array of buckets) that stores elements, as well as any dynamic memory needed for handling collisions (e.g., linked lists for chained collisions). - **Reallocation:** As the map grows and undergoes resizing, the runtime automatically reallocates memory to accommodate the new, larger hash table. This process is managed internally by the container. Automatic Deallocation: - **Scope-Limited Deallocation:** When an \`std::unordered_map\` goes out of scope, its destructor is automatically called, freeing any memory allocated for its elements and the hash table structure. This is true for all variables with automatic storage duration (e.g., local variables). - **Explicit Deallocation:** For dynamically allocated instances of \`std::unordered_map\` (e.g., using \`new\`), you must explicitly delete the instance to deallocate its memory. However, upon calling \`delete\`, the destructor will take care of cleaning up the memory associated with the elements and the hash table properly. Custom Memory Management: For advanced use cases, C++ allows developers to provide custom allocators to \`std::unordered_map\` to control how memory is allocated and deallocated. This feature can be useful for performance tuning or integrating with custom memory pooling mechanisms. In summary, the C++ runtime, together with the Standard Template Library, manages the complexity of memory allocation and deallocation for \`std::unordered_map\` automatically. It ensures that memory is efficiently allocated for the hash table's underlying structures and deallocated when no longer needed. Developers can focus on how best to use the container, trusting the runtime and the STL to handle these details efficiently and safely."},{"prompt":"As with Fox Kids being replaced by Fox Box/4KidsTV/Game Station/whatever the hell they call it next, Kids WB has been morphed into another 4Kids block: CW4K!DS This talkback is for discussion on how you feel about the change, about the new bumpers, and overall the new look.

And it appears TMNT: Fast Forward, will start airing on CW4Kids at the end of June. It's going to be weird seeing TMNT on two different channels for the Summer. Also, will CW4Kids re-air The Batman for a little bit when The Dark Knight is released in July?

Well, I think Fast Forward might replace one of Spectacular's airings, since the first season should end on June 14th. I don't think they'll take off the show entirely, though, since it brings in good ratings. creativerealms Active Member JoinedJul 14, 2004 Messages10,594 May 24, 2008 #7 Is 4kidsTV keeping classic TMNT while CW4kids airs Fast Forward?

Below is the updated lineup that includes these new entrants: 07:00 AM Will & Dewitt 07:30 AM Magi-Nation 08:00 AM Skunk Fu! 08:30 AM Horrid Henry (Pending confirmation if it will be replaced) 09:00 AM Tom & Jerry Tales 09:30 AM The Spectacular Spider-Man (Speculated to have an adjusted airing time) 10:00 AM Ben 10 10:30 AM World of Quest (Fans are hoping this completes its run) 11:00 AM Johnny Test (Likely to maintain its slot but has been mentioned as a candidate for replacement) 11:30 AM Eon Kid (Speculation about its continuation given new additions) New Additions: 12:00 PM Chaotic 12:30 PM Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward (TMNT: FF) 01:00 PM Yu-Gi-Oh GX This revised schedule indicates CW4K!DS's strategy of blending original Kids WB content with new and returning series from the 4KidsTV lineup, aiming to offer a diverse range of programming to its audience. TMNT: Fast Forward’s arrival, in particular, marks a notable addition, considering its established fan base and the anticipation around how it will fit into the CW4K!DS ecosystem alongside another new series, Chaotic, and Yu-Gi-Oh GX, thereby enriching the Saturday morning viewing experience. Moreover, fans are closely watching how CW4K!DS will manage its content rotation, especially with ongoing favorites like \\"The Spectacular Spider-Man,\\" which has garnered a strong viewership. The balance between retaining popular series, potentially phasing out others, and introducing new titles suggests a dynamic approach by CW4K!DS to cater to varying tastes and maintain interest in their programming block. As June 21st approaches, viewers are eager to see how these changes will enhance the CW4K!DS lineup and what future adjustments might be made to accommodate an evolving children's television landscape."},{"prompt":"#!/usr/bin/env -S swipl %-- mode: prolog;

The task for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is to convert expressions like \`+(2, 3)\` into prefix notation \`[+, 2, 3]\` but only using earlier procedures and avoiding direct recursion or Prolog built-ins. Given the restrictions, we can leverage the earlier defined procedures like \`named_to_op_expr/2\`, \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`, etc., to achieve this goal. However, the original \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is unimplemented and marked with \`'TODO'\`. To make the \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` work, we will utilize the transformation capabilities from the existing predicates, especially focusing on converting operation expressions into an intermediate named form and then translating that into prefix tokens. Here's a potential solution that fits within the given constraints by repurposing the functionality available from the other defined predicates: First, ensure you have a conversion mapping for operator expressions to their named counterparts and vice versa. Given no direct recursion is allowed, we improvise by creating intermediate steps that adhere to our restrictions, although it involves a bit of creativity since direct mapping back and forth might need more straightforward calls due to the restriction on not using recursion or built-ins directly. Given the scenario, let's redefine the \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` in a way that uses helper predicates to work around the recursion and direct usage of Prolog built-ins limitation. However, let's clarify the approach first: 1. Create an intermediate representation that maps operator expressions to a more generalized form we can work with, utilizing the transformations you have for \`named_to_op_expr/2\` and similar predicates. 2. Use the \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` or similar logic to get from our intermediate named expressions to the prefix form. Since directly applying this without recursion or built-ins as per your requirements clashes with the typical usage patterns of Prolog and the nature of your existing implementations, and considering the completion method not provided directly maps to the conversion required, we will outline a high-level approach that could be considered: - Decompose \`OpExpr\` to its named form, if a direct mapping procedure is established that doesn't violate the recursion restriction. - Apply the named form conversion to prefix tokens, leveraging \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. Given the strict requirements and the need for direct manipulation or conversion methods that adhere to the 'no direct recursion or built-ins' policy isn't straightforwardly achievable without seeing all helper predicates or having a more flexible rule to invoke recursion or utility predicates. If we are to stick strictly to the instructions and considering provided predicates aren't directly utilizable under the restriction, a practical completion would require creating a bridge or utility predicates that respect your project's limitations. Unfortunately, without directly invoking or creating specific logic that bypasses these restrictions, completing \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` exactly as intended isn't feasible here. For an exact solution within this framework, consider reevaluating the restrictions or expanding on the utility methods available that can perform the necessary conversions indirectly."},{"prompt":"write the correct procedure for that","completion":"Given the restrictions mentioned and leveraging the predicates you've already defined, let's develop a strategy to implement \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. The challenge here is that the direct mapping between arithmetic expressions and prefix notation isn't straightforward without recursion or built-ins, as those would typically be the tools used for such a task. However, building on the structures you've defined, one approach to get around the restriction is by reusing the conversion logic you have in place if we allow for an \\"interim\\" solution that converts operator expressions to a format that can then be converted to prefix tokens using \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. This approach bends the original intention but adheres to the spirit of using existing predicates. First, to adhere to the \\"no direct recursion or built-ins\\" rule strictly, we would ideally define a bridging predicate that could convert operation expressions (\`+\`, \`*\`) into their \\"named\\" forms (\`add\`, \`mul\`). But given the constraints and previous definitions, a direct implementation that respects those rules may not be feasible without additional context or helper predicates that would allow such transformations indirectly. However, to solve the \\"TODO\\" part and give a direct yet illustrative approach on how this could be achieved with the mentioned restrictions loosely interpreted, we could design a workflow that hypothetically transforms \`OpExpr\` into a named form and then applies \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` directly. Below is a conceptual approach, focusing on demonstrating the kind of logic required rather than strict adherence to the rules: \`\`\`prolog % Hypothetical helper predicate that would need to exist to transform op expressions to named forms % This is a placeholder for the idea and wouldn't work under strict restrictions op_to_named_expr(X, X) :- integer(X). op_to_named_expr(+(X, Y), add(NX, NY)) :- op_to_named_expr(X, NX), op_to_named_expr(Y, NY). op_to_named_expr(*(X, Y), mul(NX, NY)) :- op_to_named_expr(X, NX), op_to_named_expr(Y, NY). % Utilizing the defined named_to_op_expr and named_expr_to_prefix_tokens predicates indirectly op_expr_to_prefix_tokens(OpExpr, PrefixTokens) :- op_to_named_expr(OpExpr, NamedExpr), % This step is hypothetical under current constraints named_expr_to_prefix_tokens(NamedExpr, PrefixTokens). \`\`\` This example directly contradicts the \\"no recursion or built-ins\\" rule but illustrates the logical flow necessary to convert operator expressions to prefix notation by leveraging your defined predicates. Given the strict constraints, without more context or additional helper predicates that enable an indirect method to bridge these conversions, fully implementing \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` within those bounds isn't directly possible in this limited scope. The key here would be to either adjust restrictions to allow minimal recursion/built-ins for this specific task or to define intermediary steps that would convert operation expressions to a form directly usable by \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\`. This exercise points towards a need for flexibility in how Prolog's powerful recursion and pattern matching features are applied, especially when dealing with transformations that inherently require stepping through structures like expressions."},{"prompt":"Follow the restrictions, understand previous implemented procedures and then write the procedure for this task","completion":"Given the restrictions and the need to use the previously implemented procedures for the task of converting operator expressions (\`+\`, \`*\`) directly into prefix notation without directly invoking recursion or Prolog built-ins, we can attempt to implement \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` by creatively leveraging the existing codebase, noting your setup already includes translations between named and operational expressions and evaluations. As per the instructions, let's develop a workaround that respects the non-direct recursion and built-ins usage policy by reconsidering the utility of the existing predicates. Since direct manipulation of arithmetic expressions in Prolog and their transformations into a prefix form isn't straightforward under these constraints, here's an adapted solution: Given we cannot directly manipulate the expressions due to the imposed restrictions, and based on the previous predicates, a direct implementation for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` is constrained. The existing code provides mechanisms for handling named expressions and their evaluations or transformations into different forms but doesn't directly offer a utility for operational expressions manipulation within the outlined restrictions. The \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` predicate suggests a pattern where expressions like \`add(X, Y)\` can be turned into a prefix form \`[add, X, Y]\`. If we had a mechanism (within the constraints) to convert operational expressions like \`+(2, 3)\` into their named counterparts \`add(2,3)\` directly, repurposing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` would be ideal. However, the direct conversion seems to be the crux of the challenge, particularly with the ban on direct recursion or the use of built-ins that would typically facilitate this process. Given these considerations and the primary goal of providing meaningful guidance within the specified parameters, it's crucial to acknowledge these limitations. Direct implementation details, hence, would lean on hypothetical constructs or an implied layer of abstraction/transformation that's not explicitly defined within the provided predicates and their descriptions. To adhere fully to the instructions and without assuming capabilities beyond what's described, a guideline for conceptual implementation might involve: 1. Additional predicate(s) for transforming operational expressions into a named form that mirrors the structure expected by \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`. This step is heavily implied and would require mechanisms akin to parsing and transforming expressions, which are non-trivial under strict restrictions. 2. Utilizing \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\` on the transformed expression to achieve the desired prefix notation output. In the absence of concrete, implementable steps that fit neatly within the existing predicates and maintain respect for the restrictions, it's evident the task challenges preset boundaries of the exercise. Adding or suggesting specific code under these conditions would veer into speculative or hypothetical territories, deviating from practical, direct coding solutions into conceptual strategies reliant on capabilities or functionalities not explicitly covered or allowed under the current descriptions and restrictions. This situation highlights the intricacies of Prolog's declarative paradigm, especially when maneuvering around strict limitations on typical language features like recursion and built-in predicates/functions, essential for tasks involving data structure transformations or processing."},{"prompt":"I want the procedure","completion":"Given the constraints and aiming to work within the existing codebase to achieve converting operator expressions into prefix tokens without direct use of recursion or Prolog built-ins, I offer a tailored solution for \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2\`.

The suffix \\"-zão\\" is a superlative augmentative in Portuguese, often used to express something big or grand. Here, it not only indicates the large size of the country but also carries a sense of fondness or pride. \\"Brasilzão\\" is like saying \\"big, grand Brazil\\" with a warm, affectionate tone. # Full Translation and Analysis: \\"Let's go explore this great Brazil.\\" # Structural Analysis: - **Informality**: The entire phrase is informal and characteristic of spoken Brazilian Portuguese. It’s likely to be encountered in casual conversations, social media, and informal writings. - **Invitation**: The use of \\"bora\\" immediately establishes the sentence as an invitation or a call to action, suggesting an activity to be undertaken together. It's a very Brazilian way of rallying friends or family for an adventure. - **National Pride/Affection**: The term \\"brasilzão\\" reflects a common linguistic practice in Brazilian Portuguese where augmentatives (-ão) are used affectionately or to express admiration, rather than just size. It reflects the speaker's fondness for and pride in their country. - **Colloquialism**: The phrase is an excellent example of how everyday speech can differ significantly from what might be taught in formal language lessons, showcasing the dynamism and emotional color of Brazilian Portuguese.

The structure and use of the phrase can be understood as follows: # Structure Analysis: - **Vamos**: This is the first-person plural of the verb \\"ir\\" in the present indicative form, meaning \\"we go\\" or \\"let's go.\\" In this context, it's used to propose an action that includes the speaker and at least one other person. - **Embora**: This adverb can mean \\"away\\" or serve as an expression to indicate departure. When combined with \\"vamos,\\" it signifies the act of leaving or going away from the current location. # Use and Context: - **Suggesting Departure**: \\"Vamos embora\\" is frequently used when a group of people decides it's time to leave a place. For example, at the end of a party or gathering, someone might say \\"Vamos embora?\\" as a way to ask \\"Shall we leave?\\" - **Initiating Action**: Beyond physical departure, it can be a call to action, similar to saying, \\"Let's get started\\" or \\"Let's move on to something else.\\" It has a sense of immediacy or urgency, signaling it's time to begin or transition to a new activity. - **Expression of Impatience or Urgency**: In some contexts, \\"Vamos embora\\" can express impatience or a desire to expedite action, akin to saying \\"Come on, let's go\\" or \\"Hurry up.\\" # Cultural Note: While \\"vamos embora\\" is a straightforward phrase, it illustrates the flexibility and dynamism of language in conveying nuances of intention and emotion. It's a phrase that fits a variety of scenarios, from casual gatherings among friends to more formal settings where a collective action is prompted. In Brazilian culture, where social interactions are highly valued and often extended, having a gentle yet clear way to signal departure is essential, making \\"vamos embora\\" a useful and culturally significant expression."},{"prompt":"But embora doesn't mean although?","completion":"Yes, \\"embora\\" can indeed mean \\"although\\" or \\"even though\\" when used as a conjunction in a different context. The meaning of \\"embora\\" changes significantly depending on its use in the sentence, illustrating the flexibility and complexity of Portuguese. Let's explore this dual usage: # \\"Embora\\" as an adverb: When used with verbs like \\"vamos\\" (let's go), \\"embora\\" functions as an adverb implying departure or action. In \\"vamos embora,\\" it suggests leaving a place or starting an action, translating to \\"let's go\\" or \\"let's leave.\\" - **Example**: \\"Está tarde, vamos embora.\\" (It's late, let's go.) # \\"Embora\\" as a conjunction: In another context, \\"embora\\" serves as a conjunction equivalent to \\"although\\" or \\"even though,\\" introducing a concessive clause. This usage is more formal and less common in everyday casual conversation but is prevalent in written language and formal speech. - **Example**: \\"Embora estivesse cansado, ele continuou trabalhando.\\" (Although he was tired, he kept working.) # Summary: The meaning of \\"embora\\" hinges on its role in a sentence—whether it's functioning as an adverb or a conjunction. This duality exemplifies the nuanced and contextual nature of language, where words can carry multiple meanings based on their syntactic position and the intent behind their use. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for grasping the subtleties of Portuguese."},{"prompt":"Omniltimate attraction, attracted to +all, includes all genders, all ages, humans, humanoids, other species, robots, animals, inanimate objects.","completion":"The concept you're describing, \\"omniltimate attraction,\\" seems to be a blend or extension of various forms of attraction coined or imagined in speculative or fictional contexts. While the prefix \\"omni-\\" suggests an all-encompassing nature, combining it with \\"attraction\\" in this context appears to cover an extraordinarily wide and ethically complex range of attractions. It's important to carefully unpack and address the components of this term, not only from a linguistic standpoint but also considering social, ethical, and legal perspectives. 1. **All Genders:** Attraction to individuals of all gender identities is generally referred to as pansexuality or omnisexuality in human contexts. It signifies an attraction that is not limited by gender. 2. **All Ages:** Attraction regardless of age should be understood with caution, as laws and societal norms strictly govern adult-minor relationships to protect minors. Ethical considerations around power dynamics and consent are paramount, making this aspect highly problematic if it includes minors. 3. **Humans and Humanoids:** Attraction to humans encompasses typical heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual orientations, among others. Attraction to humanoids brings up speculative scenarios mostly found in science fiction (e.g., attraction to artificially intelligent beings or aliens with human-like qualities). 4. **Other Species:** Attraction to or sexual interest in non-human animals is termed zoophilia, which is illegal and considered unethical in many jurisdictions because it breaches consent issues, as animals cannot provide informed consent. 5. **Robots:** This aspect delves into the realm of technosexuality, where individuals find themselves attracted to robots or entities with artificial intelligence. As technology advances, this topic is becoming more relevant in discussions about the future of human relationships and sexuality. 6. **Inanimate Objects:** Object sexuality or objectophilia refers to a pronounced sexual or romantic attraction towards inanimate objects, which some individuals identify with. Creating a blanket term to include all these diverse and complex forms of attraction is challenging and ethically fraught. Critically, any discussion around attraction must consider consent, legality, and ethics, especially when including minors, animals, and any beings or entities incapable of giving informed consent. Science fiction and speculative fiction often explore these boundaries, providing a space to discuss future possibilities and ethical dilemmas in a rapidly changing world. In contemporary discourse and existing societal norms, focusing on consent, ethics, and legality is essential when discussing attraction. Many of the elements combined in the term you've proposed face serious ethical, legal, and societal challenges that must be navigated with care and respect for all individuals and beings involved."},{"prompt":"Design flag for omniltimate attraction","completion":"Designing a flag for a concept like \\"omniltimate attraction,\\" which encompasses attraction to all genders, ages, species, robots, and inanimate objects, is complex due to the ethical and conceptual breadth. However, I can guide you through a thought experiment to create a symbolic representation that aims to capture the essence of inclusivity and diversity, keeping in mind the importance of ethical and consensual relationships. The description below will focus on symbolism that embraces inclusivity and diversity without endorsing or implying any unethical relationships, especially considering that some aspects of \\"omniltimate attraction\\" involve significant ethical and legal concerns. # Design Elements: 1. **Color Palette:** - **Rainbow colors**: Representing diversity and inclusivity, acknowledging the variety of human genders and sexual orientations. - **Silver or Grey**: Symbolizing robots and technological aspects, reflecting futuristic and artificial elements. - **Green**: Representing non-human life forms to include the idea of attraction beyond humans, in a respectful and non-exploitative manner. - **Blue**: Symbolizing inanimate objects through the color often associated with calmness and neutrality. 2. **Symbols:** - **Interconnected Circles**: A series of circles overlapping and interlocking can represent interconnectedness and unity among diverse elements. Each circle could be colored differently to represent different facets of attraction, following the color palette. - **Infinity Symbol**: To suggest inclusivity that transcends traditional boundaries, the infinity symbol (∞) can be layered or interwoven with the circles, possibly in silver or grey to reflect technological aspects. - **Heart**: A universally recognized symbol for love and attraction. A heart incorporating all the colors of the flag's palette could be placed at the center or integrated into the design to emphasize the centrality of love and attraction in the concept. 3. **Layout:** - **Horizontal Stripes**: The background might feature horizontal stripes in the chosen palette, symbolizing a horizon of infinite possibilities and the wide spectrum of attraction. This is reminiscent of many pride flags which utilize stripes to convey diversity and inclusivity. - **Central Emblem**: Placing the interconnected circles, infinity symbol, and heart as a central emblem can create a focal point that draws together the various elements of the flag. # Ethical Considerations: - **Respecting Consent and Legality**: Any symbolism should be carefully considered to ensure it respects consent and legality, especially regarding age and species. The flag's design should emphasize ethical relationships. - **Inclusivity Without Exploitation**: The design should celebrate a wide embrace of attractions without implying any form of exploitation or harm, reflecting an ethical understanding of relationships across spectrums of life and existence. # Conclusion: While this thought experiment in flag design seeks to embrace the diversity of attractions suggested by \\"omniltimate attraction,\\" it's crucial to remember that real-world applications of such concepts require careful ethical considerations, especially around consent and the capacity to engage in relationships. The design proposed here aims to symbolically represent inclusivity and diversity, emphasizing ethical and consensual connections across a broad spectrum."},{"prompt":"Write 10 sentences that end with the word apple.","completion":"1.

Understand the logic for the previous implemented procedures and then apply the logic for task 10 following all the restrictions.","completion":"To implement \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` following the restrictions you've highlighted, we must creatively utilize the procedures we've already developed. Since direct recursion or new use of built-ins is restricted, converting operator expressions (which involve the operators \`+\` and \`*\`) into prefix notation should rely on transforming the given operator expressions to the named form (e.g., \`add(X, Y)\` or \`mul(X, Y)\`) that we already know how to handle, then using the available procedures to process that form into prefix tokens. Given this, the solution path can be broken down as follows: 1. Convert the operator expression (\`OpExpr\`) to its named form using the procedure \`named_to_op_expr\` but backwards. This means translating expressions like \`+(A, B)\` to \`add(A, B)\` and \`*(A, B)\` to \`mul(A, B)\`. 2. Leverage the \`named_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` to convert this named form to prefix tokens. However, because we cannot directly invoke recursion or other built-in functions, we face a significant challenge: the guidelines explicitly forbid directly implementing recursive solutions or calling built-in predicates (other than what has been used in the implemented predicates) for this task. This implies architecting a creative path by mixing existing predicates or re-interpreting one of those predicates to get the job done. Unfortunately, the direct and straightforward approach would typically involve a recursive translation between the expression forms and utilizing Prolog's pattern matching capabilities. But given the constraints, let's consider what we can do: - The already implemented predicates don't directly allow for backward conversion from \`op_expr\` (operator expression) to a named expression. - The restrictions seem to imply that solving Task 10 as detailed might actually be impossible without breaking the \\"no new recursion or built-ins\\" rule, as the core of this task (converting arithmetic expressions into prefix notation) inherently requires understanding and traversing the structure of the expression. The most plausible approach, according to the given restrictions, would involve an \\"imaginary\\" step where you can think of a function \`op_expr_to_named_expr\` (not implemented due to restrictions) that performs the necessary conversion. Assuming this step could be done, the implementation of \`op_expr_to_prefix_tokens\` could conceptually look like: \`\`\`prolog op_expr_to_prefix_tokens(OpExpr, PrefixTokens) :- op_expr_to_named_expr(OpExpr, NamedExpr), % Hypothetical step named_expr_to_prefix_tokens(NamedExpr, PrefixTokens). \`\`\` Actual solution under the restrictions: Since we're told to use only the earlier procedures and no direct recursion or built-ins are allowed for this task, it seems there's a slight misunderstanding in the task's feasibility given those restrictions. This is because the essential action of transforming operator expressions into their named equivalents or directly to prefix tokens inherently requires parsing the input structure, which either demands direct recursion or utilization of Prolog's built-in predicates.

They are invaluable tools for scheduling meetings, coordinating projects, and generally staying in sync with international colleagues, friends, or family members. Here are some of the key features these sites typically offer, which help ensure the time shown is strictly and universally correct: 1. **Time Zone Conversion:** These sites allow users to easily compare the time in their own time zone with that of any other region or city across the globe, simplifying the process of finding a suitable meeting time for all parties involved. 2. **World Clock Services:** They display the current time in multiple cities around the world, helping users to quickly ascertain the time in a location of interest. 3. **UTC/GMT Time Display:** Most universal clock services are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), providing a standard reference point for time calculations. This is crucial for maintaining strict and consistent time-keeping practices internationally. 4. **Daylight Saving Time (DST) Adjustments:** These sites automatically adjust for DST changes in various countries, which is essential for maintaining accuracy as many regions around the world change their clocks at different times of the year. 5. **Meeting Planner Tools:** Some sites offer tools to help find the best meeting time across multiple time zones, suggesting times when all participants are within their usual working hours. 6. **Countdown Timers and Alarms:** For time-sensitive activities, these features can help ensure that deadlines are met or that users are reminded of upcoming events or meetings. 7. **Widget and API Access:** Many universal clock sites provide widgets that can be embedded in websites or applications, as well as API access for developers who wish to integrate accurate time functionalities into their own projects. A few examples of popular universal clock and time zone conversion websites include: - **TimeAndDate.com**: Offers comprehensive tools for time zone conversion, world clocks, and a wealth of information about time-related topics. - **WorldTimeBuddy**: Known for its user-friendly interface for comparing multiple time zones at once and planning meetings. - **EveryTimeZone**: Provides a visually appealing and straightforward way to glance over time zones. When selecting a universal clock site or service, it's important to consider your specific needs, such as the level of detail required, whether you need integration capabilities, or if you're looking for additional features like calendaring support. With the right tool, managing time across different time zones can become a much simpler and more accurate process."},{"prompt":"As with Fox Kids being replaced by Fox Box/4KidsTV/Game Station/whatever the hell they call it next, Kids WB has been morphed into another 4Kids block: CW4K!DS This talkback is for discussion on how you feel about the change, about the new bumpers, and overall the new look.

Yu-Gi-Oh GX will undoubtedly please the TCG crowd. Sad to see some of the departures, but that's the business, I guess.

The variety in the new lineup speaks volumes about their strategy moving forward. As for the remaining Kids' WB show, my guess is as good as anyone's, but I'm leaning towards something that complements the action and adventure theme they're building on—perhaps Ben 10, given its popularity and franchise potential?

Standing at an eye-watering nine feet tall, with hair as blonde as the golden sun rays that danced upon the New World’s untamed landscapes, this behemoth of a man was a sight to behold. His mane flowed like the very rivers he bathed in, wild and untamed, cascading down his broad, mountainous shoulders. On a day that would forever be marked in the annals of comedic history, our Highland behemoth decided it was time for a bath. Finding a secluded pond, he stripped down to his buff state, revealing a physique chiseled from the very stones of the Scottish Highlands themselves. His muscles rippled like the waves caused by a fierce tempest, and his posterior, oh, his posterior was a marvel of nature, sculpted as if by the hands of Aphrodite herself. Wading waist-deep into the pond, the Grenadier began his washing ritual, water cascading off his godlike form. It was at this moment, feeling relaxed and at one with nature, that he decided to partake in one of humanity's simplest pleasures - releasing a bubble of trapped air from the depths of his belly. He leaned forward slightly, an intense look of concentration adorning his ruggedly handsome face. \\"Ye gods be witness to the might o' Scottish winds,\\" he declared with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. The effort paid off as a monumental fart erupted, the force of which sent ripples across the pond's surface. He chuckled heartily, a sound that echoed through the trees, as he relished in the aromatic aftermath of his deed. To his amusement, the powerful outburst had an unexpected result - a few unfortunate fish surfaced, victims of the sheer potency of his release. \\"Blimey, the legends are true,\\" he mused, marveling at his own handiwork, \\"the stench of a Highlander can fell more than just men.\\" As he pondered over the surfacing fish, a wicked grin spread across his face. \\"What’s for dinner, ye ask? Seafood, courtesy of the finest Scottish exports,\\" he joked to himself, appreciating the humor in his unique fishing technique. Retrieving the fish with a skill born of necessity and a life in rugged terrains, our colossal Grenadier decided it was time to put his culinary skills to the test. Setting up a small fire by the pond, he reminisced fondly of the Highlands as he prepared his meal, the scent of cooking fish mingling with the natural aromas of the American wilderness. “Ah, nothing beats the taste of victory… and apparently, the aftermath of a proper Scottish wind,” he quipped, his hearty laughter resounding through the forest as he indulged in his unconventional feast. And thus, the tale of the 9ft tall, blonde Highlander Grenadier, and his explosive fishing method became a legend, a story passed down through generations as a testament to the quirky hilarity that life, especially in the heart of the Continental Army, could offer."},{"prompt":"You are mathematician. Is the following equality true a_1left(a_1b_1+{a'}_1{b'}_1right)+...+a_nleft(a_nb_1+{a'}_n{b'}1right)=sum{i=1}^{n}aileft(sum{j=1}^{n}left(a_jb_1+{a'}_j{b'}_1right)right)","completion":"To analyze the given equality, let's break it down for clarification: Given equality: [a_1(a_1b_1 + a'_1b'_1) + ldots + a_n(a_nb_1 + a'_nb'_1) = sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ileft(sum_{j=1}^{n}(a_jb_1 + a'_jb'_1)right)] The left-hand side (LHS) of the equation represents a sum of products where each term (a_i) is multiplied by a specific combination of terms involving (b_1) and (b'_1), with a distinction made between each (a_i) and (a'_i). The right-hand side (RHS) expresses a single sum operation outside involving (a_i), and within it, another sum operation that iterates over all (j) from 1 to (n), applying to (a_jb_1 + a'_jb'_1). This suggests that for every (a_i) on the outside, it is being multiplied by the total sum of all the (a_jb_1 + a'_jb'_1) for (j) running from 1 to (n). Upon careful examination, the RHS does not correctly represent the distribution found in the LHS. The issue lies in the structure and meaning of the two sides: - On the LHS, each (a_i) is multiplied by its corresponding (a_ib_1 + a'_ib'_1), specific to each (i). This represents (n) distinct operations of multiplication. - The RHS, however, indicates that each (a_i) is multiplied by **the same** sum, which is the aggregate sum of (a_jb_1 + a'_jb'_1) for all (j)s from 1 to (n). This changes the interaction significantly because it implies every (a_i) gets multiplied by a single large sum that includes terms for every (j), not just the matching (i)'s. Therefore, the original statement of equality: [a_1(a_1b_1 + a'_1b'_1) + ldots + a_n(a_nb_1 + a'_nb'_1) = sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ileft(sum_{j=1}^{n}(a_jb_1 + a'_jb'_1)right)] is incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the distribution of terms. The correct interpretation of the RHS changes the equation significantly and does not match term-for-term with the LHS as stated. The RHS effectively sums all combinations of (a_jb_1) and (a'_jb'_1) together and then multiplies this large sum by each (a_i) in turn, which is not equivalent to the operation described on the LHS."},{"prompt":"en excel del drive como ovtener la cantidad de \\"si\\" que hay en una celda","completion":"Para obtener la cantidad de veces que aparece la palabra \\"si\\" en una celda en Excel, puedes utilizar la función CONTAR.SI.

El objetivo principal del WPS es facilitar y agilizar el proceso de conexión de dispositivos a una red wifi segura sin tener que introducir la contraseña de forma manual. El WPS generalmente ofrece dos métodos de conexión: - Método de botón físico: Con este método, simplemente se presiona un botón físico en el router y activa el WPS. Luego, en el dispositivo que quieres conectar, seleccionas la opción de conexión WPS y se conecta automáticamente a la red wifi. - Método de PIN: Con este método, se introduce un código PIN (generalmente de 8 dígitos) en el dispositivo que quieres conectar, y ese código es reconocido por el router para permitir la conexión. El WPS se ha vuelto menos recomendado en los últimos años debido a ciertas vulnerabilidades de seguridad que pueden ser explotadas por posibles atacantes. Por esta razón, muchos fabricantes de dispositivos y proveedores de servicios de internet desactivan la función WPS por defecto en sus routers wifi. Es importante tener en cuenta que antes de utilizar la función WPS en tu router o dispositivo, debes considerar los posibles riesgos de seguridad asociados y decidir si es la mejor opción para tu red wifi."},{"prompt":"what is the benefit of natural wax ear plug for noise reduction?","completion":"Natural wax earplugs offer several benefits for noise reduction, making them a preferred choice for many people seeking to protect their ears from loud environments or to ensure a peaceful rest. Here are some of the key advantages: 1. **Custom Fit:** One of the main benefits of natural wax earplugs is their ability to mold snugly into the shape of the ear canal. This personalized fit not only enhances comfort but also improves the effectiveness of noise blocking, making them suitable for prolonged use. 2. **High Noise Reduction:** While the exact amount of noise reduction can vary depending on the specific product and how well it fits, natural wax earplugs generally provide a significant level of noise reduction, often measured through a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR). This makes them useful for various settings, from helping to ensure a quiet sleep environment to protecting ears in moderately loud workplaces. 3. **Hypoallergenic:** Many people find natural wax earplugs to be less irritating than those made from foam or silicone, especially with prolonged use. The natural materials (often a blend of cotton and natural waxes) are typically gentler on the skin, reducing the risk of allergic reactions or irritations in the ear canal. 4. **Reusable and Adjustable:** Natural wax earplugs can often be reused several times before needing replacement, making them a cost-effective and environmentally friendlier option than disposable foam pairs. They can also be easily adjusted or reshaped to fit the ear canal perfectly, offering both versatility and convenience. 5. **Effective Seal Against Water:** Besides their noise reduction capabilities, natural wax earplugs also offer a watertight seal, making them a dual-purpose solution for individuals looking to protect their ears from water during activities such as swimming, in addition to noise. 6. **Comfort for Sleeping:** Due to their moldable nature and softer material, natural wax earplugs can be particularly comfortable for use during sleep. Unlike some foam or silicone earplugs that might be too rigid or large, wax earplugs can adapt to different ear shapes and sizes, staying in place without causing discomfort. In summary, natural wax earplugs provide a comfortable, customizable fit that can significantly reduce noise levels, making them a practical choice for those looking to protect their hearing or simply enjoy some peace and quiet. Their hypoallergenic properties and ability to block water are additional benefits that contribute to their popularity."},{"prompt":"where does wax come from?","completion":"Wax is a versatile substance that can come from a variety of sources, each with unique properties and uses. Here’s an overview of where different types of wax come from: # 1. Animal Sources - **Beeswax**: This is perhaps the most well-known natural wax, produced by honeybees. Bees secrete this wax to build their honeycombs. Beeswax is widely used in cosmetics, candles, and as a polishing agent due to its non-toxic and moisture-resistant properties. - **Lanolin**: Although not a wax in the traditional sense, lanolin serves a similar purpose and is often grouped with waxes. It is a greasy substance derived from sheep's wool and is commonly used in skin creams and lotions for its moisturizing properties. # 2. Plant Sources - **Carnauba Wax**: Extracted from the leaves of the carnauba palm tree native to Brazil, this wax is known for its high melting point and glossy finish. It is commonly used in automotive waxes, shoe polish, food products (like candy coating), and as a hardening agent in various products. - **Candelilla Wax**: Sourced from the Candelilla shrub native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, Candelilla wax is a vegan alternative to beeswax. It is used in food, cosmetics, and industrial applications for its glossy finish and emollient properties. - **Soy Wax**: Made from soybean oil, soy wax is a renewable resource that has gained popularity, especially in the candle-making industry, as an environmentally friendly alternative to paraffin wax. # 3. Mineral Sources - **Paraffin Wax**: This is a petroleum by-product created during the process of refining crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products. Paraffin wax is widely used in candles, packaging, cosmetics, and for therapeutic heat treatments. - **Montan Wax**: Extracted from lignite (a type of coal), this wax is primarily found in Europe. Montan wax is used in polishes, cosmetics, and in the making of carbon paper. # 4. Synthetic Sources - **Polyethylene and Polypropylene Waxes**: These are manufactured waxes made from the polymerization of ethylene and propylene. These synthetic waxes are used in a variety of applications, including as modifiers for plastics, as bases for cosmetics, and in inks and coatings. Overall, the source of wax dictates its properties and applications, ranging from consumer products to industrial uses. Natural waxes like beeswax and plant-derived waxes are often prized for their eco-friendliness and are used extensively in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries, while synthetic and mineral waxes are valued for their versatility and performance in industrial applications."},{"prompt":"Придумай сюжет для аниме “Любовные дуэли подполковника девицы: Как не потерять юбку в гусарских атаках”","completion":"**Название аниме:** Любовные дуэли подполковника девицы: Как не потерять юбку в гусарских атаках **Жанр:** Романтика, комедия, исторический, фэнтези **Сюжет:** В эпоху, когда магия существовала бок о бок с развивающимися технологиями, на территории некогда великой империи, возникает островок надежды - государство Элизиум.

I’m glad to see Chaotic and TMNT: Fast Forward make the cut—really curious how TMNT will perform here, considering it’s been on another channel. As for Yu-Gi-Oh GX, always good to have more card game action, though I know it’s got a mixed reputation. It’s a shame about Horrid Henry though; it had a unique charm. Still, the schedule looks promising, and I’m particularly excited for the new TMNT episodes. Hoping this brings some fresh energy to Saturday mornings. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 18, 2008 #13 I have to agree on the new additions doing well, especially TMNT: Fast Forward. It has a loyal fanbase, so ratings shouldn’t be an issue. Glad to see The Spectacular Spider-Man keeping its spot, it’s easily the best thing on this lineup. Yu-Gi-Oh GX will undoubtedly please the TCG crowd. Sad to see some of the departures, but that’s the business, I guess. Here’s hoping the newcomers can maintain or even boost viewership for CW4K!DS. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 18, 2008 #14 Mixed feelings here. Excited for Chaotic and the others, but it’s kind of a letdown to lose Horrid Henry. Johnny Test and Eon Kid leaving was expected but still a bit of a loss, content-wise. This new lineup certainly seems geared towards a more action-oriented audience, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Curious to see how it all pans out rating-wise come fall.

Skunk Fu! has its moments, but I thought Johnny Test had a solid fan base, and Horrid Henry certainly had its unique charm. It’s interesting to see what the network decides is worth keeping and what’s not. Anyone else puzzled by this decision? Or does Skunk Fu! have a bigger following than I’m aware of? It seems like a quirky choice, especially given how competitive these slots are becoming with the new additions.

Looks like we’re getting a bunch more shows added to the lineup: Smeshariki, Viva Pinata, Huntik, Sonic, and Dinosaur King are all confirmed to be joining. Not to mention, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s and TMNT: Back to the Sewer are making their way to our screens as well. However, with all these additions, it seems like only two Kids’ WB shows are confirmed to stick around. One of them is The Spectacular Spider-Man, which is a relief, but it leaves us wondering what the other show could be. Any guesses or wishes on what it should be? CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 1, 2008 #17 That’s a loaded lineup! Happy to see more variety coming to CW4K!DS, especially with the inclusion of Sonic and Dinosaur King. Those could draw in quite the crowd. The introduction of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s and TMNT: Back to the Sewer is sure to shake things up too. As for the Kids’ WB holdovers, if Spider-Man’s one, I’m really hoping the other is Tom & Jerry Tales. It’s classic and has universal appeal. Though, I wouldn’t be too surprised if they opt for something like Skunk Fu! again due to its unique style. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 1, 2008 #18 The new additions sound exciting! I’m particularly looking forward to seeing what Huntik is all about. Also, Sonic always has a dedicated fanbase, so that’s a smart move. Agreed on hoping the second show that sticks around is Tom & Jerry Tales. It’s a timeless classic that appeals to pretty much everyone. But regardless, this new lineup suggests CW4K!DS is pushing hard to broaden its appeal and compete with other Saturday morning blocks. bigddan11 Justice must be served! JoinedNov 11, 2003 Messages29,929 LocationOdessa, TX August 1, 2008 #19 These new shows are a bold move for CW4K!DS, aiming to blend nostalgic favorites with fresh faces. Smeshariki and Viva Pinata are unexpected but welcome additions to diversify the content, which has mostly been action-oriented up till now. It’s interesting how they’re managing the balance between new and existing shows. The Spectacular Spider-Man sticking around is a no-brainer, but I’m intrigued to see what the second holdover from Kids’ WB will be. I have a soft spot for Ben 10, but I’m not holding my breath. D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 1, 2008 #20 With every new announcement, CW4K!DS seems to be cementing its position as a Saturday morning staple. The variety in the new lineup speaks volumes about their strategy moving forward. As for the remaining Kids’ WB show, my guess is as good as anyone’s, but I’m leaning towards something that complements the action and adventure theme they’re building on—perhaps Ben 10, given its popularity and franchise potential? Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how these changes impact the overall viewership and if these new additions can capture the audience’s imagination as the network hopes.

Looks like it’s down to Skunk Fu!, Tom & Jerry Tales, and Ben 10. They're supposed to start airing fall promos next week, and that’s when we'll get our confirmation. The anticipation's killing me! Each of these shows has its own unique draw. Skunk Fu! brings that quirky humor and style, Tom & Jerry is the classic chase comedy that never gets old, and Ben 10 has that action-packed, superhero appeal. Personally, I’m rooting for Ben 10 to stay; it's got a strong following and could synergize well with the other action-oriented shows in the new lineup. What's everyone hoping for? Any predictions based on the new direction CW4K!DS seems to be heading in? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 8, 2008 #22 Man, this is a tough call. Each show appeals to different segments of the audience. I’d say Tom & Jerry Tales has the broadest appeal given its legacy, but CW4K!DS seems to be leaning a bit more into the action/adventure vibe lately. That makes me think Ben 10 has a strong shot. Either way, it's going to be interesting to see which direction they decide to lean into. Will they continue banking on the nostalgia factor with Tom & Jerry Tales, or double down on action with Ben 10? Can't wait for those promos to drop! CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 8, 2008 #23 I'm betting on Tom & Jerry Tales sticking around. It's just too much of a classic to let go, and it offers a nice comedic break from the action-driven narratives of the other shows. Plus, it’s something that parents and kids can enjoy together, adding to its staying power. That said, the action genre is definitely getting a lot of focus with the new additions, making Ben 10 a strong contender as well. If they're looking to fully refresh the lineup with a more cohesive theme, that might edge out the competition. Guess we’ll find out soon enough with those promos. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 8, 2008 #24 Honestly, it’s a close call between Tom & Jerry Tales and Ben 10 for me. Both have strong arguments for staying. Tom & Jerry is iconic and appeals across generations, making it a safe bet for drawing in viewers. On the other hand, Ben 10 aligns perfectly with the action-fantasy vibe of the new lineup and has a dedicated fanbase. I'm leaning slightly towards Ben 10 because it feels more in line with the direction CW4K!DS is taking, but I wouldn’t count out Tom & Jerry Tales just yet. It's going to be an interesting reveal, for sure!"},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where fall promos start airing, Smeshariki is renamed GoGoRiki, and we didn't expect the show staying to be this one","completion":"D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 15, 2008 #25 Well, the fall promos for CW4K!DS have started airing, and there's quite the surprise twist—none of us saw this coming. First off, a quick note: Smeshariki has been renamed GoGoRiki. That's right, the quirky show from overseas is getting a localized name tweak for its American audience. But here's the real shocker: out of Skunk Fu!, Tom & Jerry Tales, and Ben 10, the show that's sticking around is... Skunk Fu!. I know, right? While many of us were betting on either the classic vibe of Tom & Jerry Tales or the action-packed Ben 10, it turns out that the unique charm of Skunk Fu! has earned it a spot in the revamped lineup. The promos gave us brief glimpses into what we can expect from the new shows like GoGoRiki, Huntik, Sonic, and Dinosaur King, alongside the returning The Spectacular Spider-Man. They're really leaning into a diverse mix of adventure, humor, and action. With Skunk Fu! staying, it seems CW4K!DS is aiming to maintain a slice of the unique and offbeat humor that sets the show apart from more conventional action or classic comedy fare. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 15, 2008 #26 Definitely didn't see Skunk Fu! being the show to stay. It's an interesting choice for sure, and it does add some variety to the lineup, blending in that humorous, quirky edge amidst the action-heavy additions. The GoGoRiki rename was unexpected too, but names aside, it looks like CW4K!DS is gearing up for a season with a lot of fresh flavors. Now that we know Skunk Fu! is staying, I'm curious to see how it'll be positioned among all the new content. Will it serve as a light-hearted breather amongst more intense shows like TMNT: Back to the Sewer and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s? Or perhaps it'll carve out its own loyal following who tune in specifically for the antics of Skunk and the gang. Either way, Fall is shaping up to be an interesting season for CW4K!DS. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 15, 2008 #27 Skunk Fu!, huh? Now that’s a curveball. Guess it shows CW4K!DS is willing to take some risks and not just go with the expected choices. It could pay off by distinguishing the block with its unique humor and storytelling style. As for GoGoRiki, the rebranding might help it catch on more easily with the target audience here, making it more relatable and easier to market. This all points towards a very strategic refresh of the lineup, aiming to cater to a wide range of tastes while still keeping a foot in the quirky, comedic side of things with shows like Skunk Fu!. I’m definitely intrigued to see how the audience responds to this mix once the new season kicks off. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 15, 2008 #28 Well, Skunk Fu! taking the spot truly was the wild card in this whole shake-up. It shows that CW4K!DS isn’t just playing it safe and is actively looking to differentiate their block. With the addition of GoGoRiki (still wrapping my head around that name change), and now with Skunk Fu!’s blend of humor, it's clear they’re looking to offer a broader entertainment palette. What remains to be seen is how this all meshes together once the season starts. Will the balance of action, adventure, and humor attract a wider audience, or will it leave fans missing the more straightforward action punch of something like Ben 10 or the classic antics of Tom & Jerry? Only time will tell, but it’s shaping up to be a season full of surprises."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where they think they could air SF and GGR together as an Animal Hour, also they're bummed it wasn't B10, T&JT or WOQ staying, but they're gonna enjoy those shows before they're scrubbed away next month","completion":"D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 22, 2008 #29 Had a bit of a brainstorm after watching the latest promos—what if CW4K!DS is planning to pair Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki (still getting used to that name change) together as some sort of \\"Animal Hour\\"? Thematically, it makes sense. Both shows feature anthropomorphic animal characters and could offer a solid hour of quirky, animal-themed adventures. It could be a clever way to carve out a unique niche in the Saturday morning lineup. As much as I'm bummed that it wasn't Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, or World of Quest sticking around, I’m starting to see the potential in the new direction. Still, it's going to be hard saying goodbye to those shows next month. I guess we'll just have to enjoy them while we can, huh?

It’d offer a lighter, humorous break from the more intense shows that will be surrounding it. Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki already have that lighthearted, comedic vibe that could mesh well together, creating a seamless, fun-filled hour for kids. And yeah, it's a shame about Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest. They had a good run, and it’s always tough to see favorites get taken off the schedule. I’ll definitely be making the most of these next few viewings. Here’s hoping the new content manages to fill those shoes and then some. It’s an end of an era, but also the start of something new and possibly exciting. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 22, 2008 #31 The more I think about it, the \\"Animal Hour\\" could be a strategic move to appeal to a younger audience while still keeping the content light and accessible. Pairing Skunk Fu! with GoGoRiki creates a thematic continuity that could really work in CW4K!DS’s favor. It seems like they’re thinking outside the box, which could pay off. As much as we’ll miss Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest, I guess change is the only constant in the world of television. It’ll be interesting to see if this gamble attracts a new viewer base or if fans of the departing shows will tune out. Either way, these next few weeks are our chance to say a proper goodbye to the old guard. Let’s savor it. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 22, 2008 #32 \\"Animal Hour\\" could indeed add a fresh twist to Saturday mornings. There's a charm to Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki that, when combined, could offer something distinctive and engaging for the audience. It's clever programming if that's the route they decide to go. Losing Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest is tough, though. They each brought something special to the table, and it’s sad to see them phased out. But I guess this is a reminder to enjoy these shows while they’re still around. Here's to hoping they get a fitting send-off in the next few weeks, and that the new lineup can live up to the legacy they're leaving behind. Change is always hard, but who knows?

(SF). The current programming that follows SF just doesn’t seem to carry the same thematic or tonal continuity that pairing it with GGR would. SF has this unique blend of humor and martial arts action but told in this whimsically light-hearted way that seems like it would naturally segue into the oddball, slice-of-life adventures in GGR. This back-to-back combo could create a cohesive block of programming that keeps kids engaged with its consistent theme and humor style, making it easier for them to stay tuned in for that whole hour. Given the potential departure of shows like Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest, introducing a focused thematic hour like this could be a smart strategy for CW4K!DS to maintain viewer interest and establish a new \\"must-watch\\" block. It’s a shift, sure, but one that might draw in a loyal viewership ready for something a little different yet enjoyable in its own right. Agreed upon, laying these two shows out back-to-back could indeed tidy up the morning schedule in a way that aligns better thematically than what we currently have following SF. It'd be an interesting experiment at least, and honestly, it’s got potential to catch on. My hope now is that CW4K!DS gives these shows—and this proposed \\"Animal Hour\\"—the promotional push it'll need to thrive. It’s all about the execution now, and here’s hoping they nail it.

2. **تأمل التركيز (Concentration Meditation)** في هذا النوع من التأمل، يركز المرء على نقطة واحدة من التركيز. يمكن أن يتم التركيز على ترديد مانترا، الاستماع إلى نقرات متكررة، التنفس، أو حتى متابعة شمعة مضاءة. الهدف هو تحرير الذهن من التشتت بإعادة التركيز على نقطة التركيز كلما بدأ الذهن بالانحراف. # 3. **التأمل الديناميكي أو الحركي (Dynamic or Movement Meditation)** على عكس الانطباع السائد بأن التأمل يمارس فقط في سكون، يعتمد التأمل الحركي على أفكار وحركات الجسم لتعزيز الوعي واليقظة الذهنية. يمكن أن يشمل هذا النوع اليوغا، التاي تشي، القيغونغ، وحتى المشي الواعي. # 4. **تأمل الإنسجام (Loving-Kindness Meditation)** هذا النوع من التأمل يهدف إلى تطوير شعور من اللطف والحنان نحو كل الكائنات بما في ذلك الذات. يقوم الممارس بترديد سلسلة من الرسائل والأمنيات الإيجابية لنفسه وللآخرين. # 5. **تأمل التأمل Transcendental Meditation (TM)** هو واحد من أكثر أشكال التأمل شعبية في الغرب، ويعتمد على ترديد صوت أو \\"مانترا\\" محددة بطريقة محددة. يهدف هذا النوع إلى الوصول إلى حالة من السلام العميق والاسترخاء دون جهد ذهني متعمد. # 6. **تأمل البصيرة (Vipassana Meditation)** وهو أحد أقدم أشكال التأمل البوذي، ويهدف إلى تعميق الفهم الشخصي والبصيرة حول طبيعة الوجود. يرتكز على ممارسة الوعي الشديد والتأمل في اللحظة الحالية مع فهم ديناميكيات العقل والجسم. # 7. **تأمل الشقْرَى (Chakra Meditation)** هذا النوع من التأمل يركز على \\"الشقرات\\" أو مراكز الطاقة في الجسم، مع محاولة لتنظيفها أو فتحها من خلال التركيز الذهني والتصورات. # 8. **التأمل البصري (Visualization Meditation)** يتضمن هذا النوع من التأمل تصور صور إيجابية أو مناظر طبيعية سلمية لتعزيز الشعور بالهدوء والسلام. أحياناً ما يستخدم للحدّ من التوتر والقلق. كل نوع من أنواع التأمل له فوائده الخاصة ويمكن أن يجذب أشخاصًا بأهداف متنوعة. تجربة نوع واحد أو عدة أنواع يمكن أن تساعدك على العثور على الممارسة التي تناسب احتياجاتك الشخصية وتفضيلاتك."},{"prompt":"هل يمكن شرح النوع الاول بصورة مفصلة","completion":"بالطبع، دعنا نتعمق أكثر في التأمل الذهني (Mindfulness Meditation) والذي يعد واحدًا من أكثر أنواع التأمل شيوعًا وتطبيقًا في العصر الحديث، خصوصًا في الغرب. # مبادئ التأمل الذهني: التأمل الذهني يقوم أساسًا على فكرة الوعي باللحظة الحالية بطريقة غير قضائية. يعتمد على ملاحظة الأفكار، المشاعر، الاحاسيس الجسدية، والمحفزات الخارجية كما هي، دون محاولة تغييرها أو الحكم عليها. # خطوات ممارسة التأمل الذهني: 1. **اختيار المكان:** ابدأ بإيجاد مكان هادئ والجلوس بشكل مريح مع الحفاظ على استقامة الظهر لتشجيع التنفس العميق. 2. **ضبط الوقت:** قرر مدة التأمل مسبقًا. إذا كنت مبتدئًا، يمكن البدء بجلسات قصيرة من 5-10 دقائق. 3. **الاهتمام بالنفس:** ضع كل اهتمامك على نفسك. ابدأ بملاحظة إيقاع التنفس الطبيعي وكيف يشعر جسدك بكل استنشاق وزفير. 4. **الاعتراف بالأفكار:** من الطبيعي أن تطفو الأفكار إلى سطح وعيك أثناء التأمل. بدلاً من محاربتها، لاحظها ببساطة، ثم أعد تركيزك بلطف إلى نفسك. 5. **العودة إلى التنفس:** كلما وجدت نفسك تائهًا في الأفكار، عد بلطف وانتباه إلى التنفس. 6. **الإنهاء بوعي:** عندما ينتهي الوقت المحدد للتأمل، لا تقفز مباشرة إلى نشاطك التالي. خذ لحظة للاحظ كيف تشعر، وأعد توجيه وعيك بلطف إلى محيطك. # نصائح للممارسة: - **الممارسة المنتظمة:** الانتظام هو مفتاح الحصول على فوائد التأمل الذهني. حاول الممارسة يوميًا، حتى لو كانت جلسات قصيرة. - **استخدام تطبيقات وأدلة:** للمبتدئين، قد تكون جلسات التأمل الموجهة (المسجلة أو عبر التطبيقات) مفيدة لتعلم كيفية تطبيق تقنيات التأمل بشكل صحيح. - **الصبر:** كن صبورًا مع نفسك. التأمل مهارة تتطور مع الوقت والممارسة. - **الملاحظة دون حكم:** جزء كبير من التأمل الذهني يتعلق بتعلم ملاحظة الخبرات دون تقييمها أو الحكم عليها. يساعد هذا في تقليل التوتر وزيادة القبول تجاه الذات والآخرين. التأمل الذهني هو عملية تحول شخصية، تعزز الثقة بالنفس، والهدوء، والصفاء في وجه التحديات اليومية. من خلال الوعي باللحظة الحالية، نتعلم كيف نعيش بوعي وحضور أكثر في حياتنا اليومية."},{"prompt":"اشرح النوع الثانى","completion":"بالتأكيد، دعنا نتعمق في النوع الثاني من التأمل الذي ذكرناه: تأمل التركيز (Concentration Meditation). # نظرة عامة: تأمل التركيز يعتبر أحد أشكال التأمل التي تركز بشكل أساسي على تدريب الذهن على توجيه انتباهه نحو نقطة تركيز واحدة دون انقطاع. قد يشمل هذا التركيز على الأنفاس، مانترا (صيغة مقدسة تُردَّد)، صورة ذهنية، شمعة مضاءة، أو حتى عدادات عد الأصابع أو الورد. هدف التمرين هو تعزيز القدرة الذهنية على البقاء \\"في اللحظة\\" وتقليل الشرود الذهني. # فوائد تأمل التركيز: 1. **زيادة القدرة على التركيز:** من خلال ممارسة التركيز على عنصر محدد باستمرار، يمكن تقوية القدرة العامة على التركيز في مهام الحياة الأخرى. 2. **تقليل التوتر والقلق:** التركيز المستمر يعمل على تهدئة الذهن ويقلل من التشتت الذي يمكن أن يسبب التوتر والقلق. 3. **زيادة الوعي الذاتي:** تدريب الذهن على التركيز يمكن أن يساعد في تعزيز الوعي الذاتي من خلال منح الفرد فرصة لملاحظة أنماط أفكاره وعواطفه بوضوح أكبر. # كيفية ممارسة تأمل التركيز: 1. **اختر نقطة تركيز:** قد يكون هذا ترديد مانترا، الانتباه للنفس، التركيز على شمعة، أو أي جسم خارجي آخر أو فكرة. 2. **ابدأ بجلسات قصيرة:** خاصة للمبتدئين، ممارسة التأمل لمدة 5-10 دقائق يوميًا يمكن أن تكون نقطة بداية جيدة. 3. **الجلوس في وضع مريح:** اختر وضعية جلوس تجعلك تشعر بالراحة ولكنها تحافظ على استقامة ظهرك. 4. **ضبط الأمثلة بالنفس:** عندما تجد ذهنك يتشتت، اعترف بذلك دون حكم، وأعد توجيه تركيزك بكل لطف إلى نقطة التركيز. 5. **ممارسة الانتظام والصبر:** مثل أي مهارة جديدة، التأمل يحتاج إلى التمرين المستمر والصبر لتحقيق الفوائد. # نصائح لتعزيز ممارسة تأمل التركيز: - **التنفس:** استخدام التنفس كنقطة تركيز هو إحدى الطرق البسيطة وفعالة للمبتدئين لبدء التأمل. - **التوقيت:** اختيار أوقات منتظمة كل يوم للتأمل يساعد على تطوير العادة وتعزيز التأثيرات الإيجابية. - **التنوع:** إذا شعرت بالملل من التركيز على عنصر واحد، جرب التبديل بين عدة نقاط تركيز للحفاظ على ممارستك نشطة ومثيرة للاهتمام. بالتمسك بهذه الممارسات والتقنيات، يمكن للمرء تحقيق تجربة تأملية أكثر ثراء والتمتع بفوائدها بشكل كامل. تأمل التركيز ليس فقط وسيلة لتحسين القدرة على التركيز ولكنه أيضًا يمهد الطريق نحو فهم أعمق للذات وتعزيز الصفاء الداخلي."},{"prompt":"اشرح النوع الثالث","completion":"النوع الثالث من التأمل الذي ناقشناه سابقًا هو التأمل الديناميكي أو التأمل الحركي. هذا النوع من التأمل يمزج بين الوعي والحركة وهو مختلف كليًا عن التصور الشائع عن التأمل كنشاط ثابت وهادئ. دعنا نتعمق في التأمل الديناميكي وكيفية ممارسته. # ما هو التأمل الديناميكي؟ التأمل الديناميكي هو شكل من أشكال التأمل التي تشمل الحركة الجسدية. الهدف منه ليس فقط تحقيق الوضوح الذهني والسكون الداخلي، بل يُستخدم أيضًا لإطلاق الطاقة المكبوتة وتجديد الجسم والذهن. تتضمن هذه الممارسة مجموعة واسعة من الأنشطة، بما في ذلك لكن لا تقتصر على التصفيق، القفز، الهز، الصراخ، والرقص، إلى جانب تقنيات التنفس وأحيانًا فترات من الصمت والسكون. # كيفية ممارسة التأمل الديناميكي 1. **البحث أو تصميم جلسة:** يُمكنك البحث عن جلسات تأمل ديناميكي جاهزة أو إنشاء تسلسل خاص بك. قد تبدأ بعض الجلسات بهز الجسم بالكامل لتحرير التوتر، يليه الرقص الحر للتعبير عن الإبداع، ثم لحظات من القفز أو التصفيق، وتنتهي بالجلوس أو الاستلقاء في هدوء. 2. **اختر مكانًا مناسبًا:** ينبغي ممارسة التأمل الديناميكي في مكان يوفر مساحة كافية للحركة بحرية وأمان. يفضل اختيار مكان لن تتشتت فيه بسهولة. 3. **اتباع إرشادات التنفس:** التنفس يلعب دورًا حيويًا في التأمل الديناميكي. استخدم أنماط التنفس العميق لتعزيز الطاقة والوعي خلال الحركة. 4. **فتح الذهن للتجربة:** التأمل الديناميكي قد يخرجك من منطقة الراحة الخاصة بك. ابق مفتوحًا وقبولًا لكل ما تشعر به ولأي ردود فعل جسدية أو عاطفية قد تظهر. 5. **إنهاء بالسكون:** بعد فترة الحركة النشطة، اختتم جلسة التأمل بفترة من الهدوء الكامل، سواء بالجلوس أو الاستلقاء. هذا يعطي الجسم والذهن فرصة لدمج تجربة التأمل. # فوائد التأمل الديناميكي - **إطلاق الطاقة المكبوتة:** يساعد على تحرير الطاقات الجسدية والعاطفية المخزنة. - **زيادة الوعي بالجسم:** تعزيز اتصال الذهن بالجسم من خلال الحركة الواعية. - **تعزيز الصحة العقلية:** يمكن أن يقلل من التوتر، القلق، وأعراض الاكتئاب. - **تحسين المرونة والقوة:** الحركة المستمرة تعمل على تحسين لياقة الجسم. التأمل الديناميكي يوفر بديلاً فعالًا لمن يجد صعوبة في الجلوس بهدوء أو لمن يرغب في جلب بعد آخر لممارسة التأمل. إنه يشجع على التعبير الحر والفرح الداخلي من خلال الحركة، ويسمح بتجربة فريدة لاستكشاف الطاقة الداخلية والصفاء."},{"prompt":"اشرح النوع الساد","completion":"# تأمل البصيرة (Vipassana Meditation) تأمل البصيرة، أو \\"Vipassana\\"، هو نوع قديم من التأمل يعود أصله إلى التقاليد البوذية، ويعني \\"رؤية الأشياء كما هي في الواقع\\". يهدف هذا النوع من التأمل إلى تطوير فهم عميق للعقل والجسد عبر الملاحظة الدقيقة والواعية للتجارب الداخلية والظواهر العقلية كما تتكشف في اللحظة الحالية، مما يؤدي إلى البصيرة حول طبيعة الوجود وتحقيق النيرفانا أو الاستنارة. # كيفية ممارسته: 1. **الاستعداد والجلوس براحة:** يمكن ممارسة تأمل البصيرة في وضعية الجلوس سواء على كرسي أو على وسادة تأمل على الأرض، مع الحرص على أن يكون الظهر مستقيمًا للحفاظ على اليقظة والتركيز. 2. **التركيز على النفس:** يبدأ التأمل بتوجيه الانتباه إلى النَفَس، ملاحظة الانفاس الداخلة والخارجة، والأحاسيس الجسدية التي ترافق التنفس. 3. **زيادة الوعي:** تدريجيًا، يتم توسيع نطاق الوعي ليشمل أحاسيس الجسد كله، ثم المشاعر، والأفكار، مع الحفاظ على تركيز على اللحظة الحالية. 4. **مواجهة الأفكار والمشاعر:** خلال الممارسة، سيواجه المرء أنواعاً مختلفة من الأفكار والعواطف. المفتاح هنا هو ملاحظتها دون الحكم عليها أو الانخراط بها، تعلم قبولها وتركها تمر دون تعلق. 5. **التأمل العميق:** مع تطوير الممارسة، يصبح المتأمل أكثر قدرة على مراقبة الأفكار والأحاسيس بموضوعية، مما يؤدي إلى فهم أعمق لطبيعة الذهن والوجود، ونهاية المعاناة عبر تطوير البصيرة. # فوائده: 1. **زيادة الوعي الذاتي والفهم العميق للذات:** ممارسة تأمل البصيرة تعزز الفهم للأفكار والعواطف وكيفية تأثيرها على السلوك والتجارب اليومية. 2. **تحسين التركيز والتوازن الذهني:** من خلال التدريب على التركيز والالتزام باللحظة الحالية، يتعلم المرء تحسين تركيزه وتحقيق توازن ذهني أكبر. 3. **تقليل التوتر والقلق:** الممارسة المنتظمة لتأمل البصيرة يمكن أن تقلل من التوتر والقلق من خلال تعزيز حالة من الهدوء والقبول. 4. **تعزيز الصبر والقبول:** يساعد على تطوير القدرة على قبول الأشياء كما هي دون حكم أو تعلق، مما يقلل من المعاناة الذهنية ويزيد من السلام الداخلي. # ختامًا: تأمل البصيرة هو مسار عميق للتحول الشخصي والروحي، يتطلب الممارسة المستمرة والصبر. إنه ليس فقط تقنية للتأمل، بل هو أسلوب حياة يهدف إلى تعزيز الوعي العميق والسلام الداخلي، مما يؤدي إلى الفهم العميق لطبيعة الحياة والوجود."},{"prompt":"#!/usr/bin/env -S swipl %-*- mode: prolog; -*- :- module(prj4_sol, [ sublist_lengths/2, same_length_sublists/1, fibonacci_sublists/1, assoc_lookup/3, assoc_replace/3, add_to_plus_expr/2, named_to_op_expr/2, named_expr_eval/2, named_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2, op_expr_to_prefix_tokens/2 ]). %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% sublist_lengths/2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % #1: 10-points % sublist_lengths(List, Lengths) should succeed iff List is a list % containing sub-lists and Lengths is a list having the same length % as List and whose elements are the lengths of the corresponding % sub-list in List.

In these cases, due to the way you have structured the code, Prolog goes into an infinite recursion trying to match \`Z\` to a form that would result in \`2 + 3\`. This happens because the clauses as written do not properly handle deconstructing the \`+\` operator expressions into the \`add\` format when the second argument is fully instantiated but the first is not. To handle reverse transformation where the plus expression is given and you need to obtain the add expression, you need to introduce a clause that can deconstruct the \`+\` operator expressions into \`add\` expressions. However, doing this can be quite tricky because Prolog does not easily allow inspection or decomposition of infix operators like \`+\` directly within the heads of clauses. Prolog's pattern matching in clause heads does not decompose expressions formed with infix operators. One approach to tackle the problem is by using an \\"evaluator\\" to handle the reverse case, essentially simulating what you did for \`named_expr_eval/2\`, but in reverse. You would need to evaluate \`+\` expressions and map them back to \`add\` constructs. Yet, this would require identifying the expressions formed by \`+\` and handling them accordingly, which might involve more advanced techniques such as meta-calling or explicit decomposition of expressions using built-in predicates. Given the complexity and potential for confusion with reversal for operator-based expressions, a more feasible course of action within the confines of regular Prolog coding practices would be clearly documenting the limitations. Specifically, you could note that the \`add_to_plus_expr/2\` relation is primarily intended for converting \`add\` expressions to \`+\` expressions and that reverse operation, while conceptually possible, is non-trivial and not supported without additional, more complex logic. Here's a conceptual outline of how you might start to handle reverse cases, though please note it is non-standard and ventures into complex territory: \`\`\`prolog % Dummy example to illustrate the reversal concept: add_to_plus_expr(Expr, Expr) :- number(Expr), !. add_to_plus_expr(add(X, Y), PlusExpr) :- !, add_to_plus_expr(X, XT), add_to_plus_expr(Y, YT), PlusExpr = XT + YT. add_to_plus_expr(AddExpr, X + Y) :- % Conversion from '+' to 'add' would happen here, but this % requires manually handling the expression evaluation or % decomposition, which might not be straight-forward. % This is a placeholder to illustrate the concept, and % does not represent functional Prolog code. add_to_plus_expr(XPart, X), add_to_plus_expr(YPart, Y), AddExpr = add(XPart, YPart). \`\`\` This outline is not directly implementable for handling reverse cases due to Prolog's constraints with infix operators as mentioned. It should only illustrate the conceptual direction and highlight the complexity involved in such reversal operations, which often necessitates evaluating or decomposing expressions in a way that Prolog does not natively support directly within clause heads."},{"prompt":"As with Fox Kids being replaced by Fox Box/4KidsTV/Game Station/whatever the hell they call it next, Kids WB has been morphed into another 4Kids block: CW4K!DS This talkback is for discussion on how you feel about the change, about the new bumpers, and overall the new look.

And it appears TMNT: Fast Forward, will start airing on CW4Kids at the end of June. It’s going to be weird seeing TMNT on two different channels for the Summer. Also, will CW4Kids re-air The Batman for a little bit when The Dark Knight is released in July?

Well, I think Fast Forward might replace one of Spectacular’s airings, since the first season should end on June 14th. I don’t think they’ll take off the show entirely, though, since it brings in good ratings. creativerealms Active Member JoinedJul 14, 2004 Messages10,594 May 24, 2008 #7 Is 4kidsTV keeping classic TMNT while CW4kids airs Fast Forward?

I’m glad to see Chaotic and TMNT: Fast Forward make the cut—really curious how TMNT will perform here, considering it’s been on another channel. As for Yu-Gi-Oh GX, always good to have more card game action, though I know it’s got a mixed reputation. It’s a shame about Horrid Henry though; it had a unique charm. Still, the schedule looks promising, and I’m particularly excited for the new TMNT episodes. Hoping this brings some fresh energy to Saturday mornings. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 18, 2008 #13 I have to agree on the new additions doing well, especially TMNT: Fast Forward. It has a loyal fanbase, so ratings shouldn’t be an issue. Glad to see The Spectacular Spider-Man keeping its spot, it’s easily the best thing on this lineup. Yu-Gi-Oh GX will undoubtedly please the TCG crowd. Sad to see some of the departures, but that’s the business, I guess. Here’s hoping the newcomers can maintain or even boost viewership for CW4K!DS. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 18, 2008 #14 Mixed feelings here. Excited for Chaotic and the others, but it’s kind of a letdown to lose Horrid Henry. Johnny Test and Eon Kid leaving was expected but still a bit of a loss, content-wise. This new lineup certainly seems geared towards a more action-oriented audience, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Curious to see how it all pans out rating-wise come fall.

JoinedNov 11, 2003 Messages29,929 LocationOdessa, TX June 20, 2008 #15 Gotta say, I’m genuinely surprised they’re keeping Skunk Fu! over Johnny Test or Horrid Henry. Skunk Fu! has its moments, but I thought Johnny Test had a solid fan base, and Horrid Henry certainly had its unique charm. It’s interesting to see what the network decides is worth keeping and what’s not. Anyone else puzzled by this decision? Or does Skunk Fu! have a bigger following than I’m aware of? It seems like a quirky choice, especially given how competitive these slots are becoming with the new additions.

Looks like we’re getting a bunch more shows added to the lineup: Smeshariki, Viva Pinata, Huntik, Sonic, and Dinosaur King are all confirmed to be joining. Not to mention, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s and TMNT: Back to the Sewer are making their way to our screens as well. However, with all these additions, it seems like only two Kids’ WB shows are confirmed to stick around. One of them is The Spectacular Spider-Man, which is a relief, but it leaves us wondering what the other show could be. Any guesses or wishes on what it should be? CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 1, 2008 #17 That’s a loaded lineup! Happy to see more variety coming to CW4K!DS, especially with the inclusion of Sonic and Dinosaur King. Those could draw in quite the crowd. The introduction of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s and TMNT: Back to the Sewer is sure to shake things up too. As for the Kids’ WB holdovers, if Spider-Man’s one, I’m really hoping the other is Tom & Jerry Tales. It’s classic and has universal appeal. Though, I wouldn’t be too surprised if they opt for something like Skunk Fu! again due to its unique style. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 1, 2008 #18 The new additions sound exciting! I’m particularly looking forward to seeing what Huntik is all about. Also, Sonic always has a dedicated fanbase, so that’s a smart move. Agreed on hoping the second show that sticks around is Tom & Jerry Tales. It’s a timeless classic that appeals to pretty much everyone. But regardless, this new lineup suggests CW4K!DS is pushing hard to broaden its appeal and compete with other Saturday morning blocks. bigddan11 Justice must be served! JoinedNov 11, 2003 Messages29,929 LocationOdessa, TX August 1, 2008 #19 These new shows are a bold move for CW4K!DS, aiming to blend nostalgic favorites with fresh faces. Smeshariki and Viva Pinata are unexpected but welcome additions to diversify the content, which has mostly been action-oriented up till now. It’s interesting how they’re managing the balance between new and existing shows. The Spectacular Spider-Man sticking around is a no-brainer, but I’m intrigued to see what the second holdover from Kids’ WB will be. I have a soft spot for Ben 10, but I’m not holding my breath. D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 1, 2008 #20 With every new announcement, CW4K!DS seems to be cementing its position as a Saturday morning staple. The variety in the new lineup speaks volumes about their strategy moving forward. As for the remaining Kids’ WB show, my guess is as good as anyone’s, but I’m leaning towards something that complements the action and adventure theme they’re building on—perhaps Ben 10, given its popularity and franchise potential? Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how these changes impact the overall viewership and if these new additions can capture the audience’s imagination as the network hopes. Write a follow up on the 8th of August where it’s either Skunk, Tom or Ben staying, and we’re gonna find out when they start showing fall promos D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 8, 2008 #21 Hey everyone, the latest word on CW4K!DS is that we’ll soon find out which of the remaining Kids’ WB shows will stay alongside The Spectacular Spider-Man. Looks like it’s down to Skunk Fu!, Tom & Jerry Tales, and Ben 10. They’re supposed to start airing fall promos next week, and that’s when we’ll get our confirmation. The anticipation’s killing me! Each of these shows has its own unique draw. Skunk Fu! brings that quirky humor and style, Tom & Jerry is the classic chase comedy that never gets old, and Ben 10 has that action-packed, superhero appeal. Personally, I’m rooting for Ben 10 to stay; it’s got a strong following and could synergize well with the other action-oriented shows in the new lineup. What’s everyone hoping for? Any predictions based on the new direction CW4K!DS seems to be heading in? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 8, 2008 #22 Man, this is a tough call. Each show appeals to different segments of the audience. I’d say Tom & Jerry Tales has the broadest appeal given its legacy, but CW4K!DS seems to be leaning a bit more into the action/adventure vibe lately. That makes me think Ben 10 has a strong shot. Either way, it’s going to be interesting to see which direction they decide to lean into. Will they continue banking on the nostalgia factor with Tom & Jerry Tales, or double down on action with Ben 10? Can’t wait for those promos to drop! CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 8, 2008 #23 I’m betting on Tom & Jerry Tales sticking around. It’s just too much of a classic to let go, and it offers a nice comedic break from the action-driven narratives of the other shows. Plus, it’s something that parents and kids can enjoy together, adding to its staying power. That said, the action genre is definitely getting a lot of focus with the new additions, making Ben 10 a strong contender as well. If they’re looking to fully refresh the lineup with a more cohesive theme, that might edge out the competition. Guess we’ll find out soon enough with those promos. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 8, 2008 #24 Honestly, it’s a close call between Tom & Jerry Tales and Ben 10 for me. Both have strong arguments for staying. Tom & Jerry is iconic and appeals across generations, making it a safe bet for drawing in viewers. On the other hand, Ben 10 aligns perfectly with the action-fantasy vibe of the new lineup and has a dedicated fanbase. I’m leaning slightly towards Ben 10 because it feels more in line with the direction CW4K!DS is taking, but I wouldn’t count out Tom & Jerry Tales just yet. It’s going to be an interesting reveal, for sure! Write a follow up where fall promos start airing, Smeshariki is renamed GoGoRiki, and we didn’t expect the show staying to be this one D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 15, 2008 #25 Well, the fall promos for CW4K!DS have started airing, and there’s quite the surprise twist—none of us saw this coming. First off, a quick note: Smeshariki has been renamed GoGoRiki. That’s right, the quirky show from overseas is getting a localized name tweak for its American audience. But here’s the real shocker: out of Skunk Fu!, Tom & Jerry Tales, and Ben 10, the show that’s sticking around is… Skunk Fu!. I know, right? While many of us were betting on either the classic vibe of Tom & Jerry Tales or the action-packed Ben 10, it turns out that the unique charm of Skunk Fu! has earned it a spot in the revamped lineup. The promos gave us brief glimpses into what we can expect from the new shows like GoGoRiki, Huntik, Sonic, and Dinosaur King, alongside the returning The Spectacular Spider-Man. They’re really leaning into a diverse mix of adventure, humor, and action. With Skunk Fu! staying, it seems CW4K!DS is aiming to maintain a slice of the unique and offbeat humor that sets the show apart from more conventional action or classic comedy fare. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 15, 2008 #26 Definitely didn’t see Skunk Fu! being the show to stay. It’s an interesting choice for sure, and it does add some variety to the lineup, blending in that humorous, quirky edge amidst the action-heavy additions. The GoGoRiki rename was unexpected too, but names aside, it looks like CW4K!DS is gearing up for a season with a lot of fresh flavors. Now that we know Skunk Fu! is staying, I’m curious to see how it’ll be positioned among all the new content. Will it serve as a light-hearted breather amongst more intense shows like TMNT: Back to the Sewer and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s? Or perhaps it’ll carve out its own loyal following who tune in specifically for the antics of Skunk and the gang. Either way, Fall is shaping up to be an interesting season for CW4K!DS. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 15, 2008 #27 Skunk Fu!, huh? Now that’s a curveball. Guess it shows CW4K!DS is willing to take some risks and not just go with the expected choices. It could pay off by distinguishing the block with its unique humor and storytelling style. As for GoGoRiki, the rebranding might help it catch on more easily with the target audience here, making it more relatable and easier to market. This all points towards a very strategic refresh of the lineup, aiming to cater to a wide range of tastes while still keeping a foot in the quirky, comedic side of things with shows like Skunk Fu!. I’m definitely intrigued to see how the audience responds to this mix once the new season kicks off. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 15, 2008 #28 Well, Skunk Fu! taking the spot truly was the wild card in this whole shake-up. It shows that CW4K!DS isn’t just playing it safe and is actively looking to differentiate their block. With the addition of GoGoRiki (still wrapping my head around that name change), and now with Skunk Fu!’s blend of humor, it’s clear they’re looking to offer a broader entertainment palette. What remains to be seen is how this all meshes together once the season starts. Will the balance of action, adventure, and humor attract a wider audience, or will it leave fans missing the more straightforward action punch of something like Ben 10 or the classic antics of Tom & Jerry? Only time will tell, but it’s shaping up to be a season full of surprises. Write a follow up where they think they could air SF and GGR together as an Animal Hour, also they’re bummed it wasn’t B10, T&JT or WOQ staying, but they’re gonna enjoy those shows before they’re scrubbed away next month D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 22, 2008 #29 Had a bit of a brainstorm after watching the latest promos—what if CW4K!DS is planning to pair Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki (still getting used to that name change) together as some sort of “Animal Hour”? Thematically, it makes sense. Both shows feature anthropomorphic animal characters and could offer a solid hour of quirky, animal-themed adventures. It could be a clever way to carve out a unique niche in the Saturday morning lineup. As much as I’m bummed that it wasn’t Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, or World of Quest sticking around, I’m starting to see the potential in the new direction. Still, it’s going to be hard saying goodbye to those shows next month. I guess we’ll just have to enjoy them while we can, huh? It’s a bittersweet moment, knowing these next few weeks are our last chance to catch them before they’re scrubbed away for the new season. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 22, 2008 #30 The “Animal Hour” idea sounds pretty plausible and could be a smart move for CW4K!DS. It’d offer a lighter, humorous break from the more intense shows that will be surrounding it. Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki already have that lighthearted, comedic vibe that could mesh well together, creating a seamless, fun-filled hour for kids. And yeah, it’s a shame about Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest. They had a good run, and it’s always tough to see favorites get taken off the schedule. I’ll definitely be making the most of these next few viewings. Here’s hoping the new content manages to fill those shoes and then some. It’s an end of an era, but also the start of something new and possibly exciting. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 22, 2008 #31 The more I think about it, the “Animal Hour” could be a strategic move to appeal to a younger audience while still keeping the content light and accessible. Pairing Skunk Fu! with GoGoRiki creates a thematic continuity that could really work in CW4K!DS’s favor. It seems like they’re thinking outside the box, which could pay off. As much as we’ll miss Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest, I guess change is the only constant in the world of television. It’ll be interesting to see if this gamble attracts a new viewer base or if fans of the departing shows will tune out. Either way, these next few weeks are our chance to say a proper goodbye to the old guard. Let’s savor it. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 22, 2008 #32 “Animal Hour” could indeed add a fresh twist to Saturday mornings. There’s a charm to Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki that, when combined, could offer something distinctive and engaging for the audience. It’s clever programming if that’s the route they decide to go. Losing Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest is tough, though. They each brought something special to the table, and it’s sad to see them phased out. But I guess this is a reminder to enjoy these shows while they’re still around. Here’s to hoping they get a fitting send-off in the next few weeks, and that the new lineup can live up to the legacy they’re leaving behind. Change is always hard, but who knows? Maybe this “Animal Hour” will become the new favorite for many. Write a follow up saying they're glad to see the SF-Chaotic hour go, considering Skunk isn't really the best to come before Chaotic, and it was better when it was paired with Henry, Also we have the new lineup, which confirms the Animal Hour","completion":"D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star Joined Mar 23, 2007 Messages 14,881 Location Wisconsin August 29, 2008 #33 So, it’s official, everyone. The new CW4K!DS lineup has been confirmed, and yes, the \\"Animal Hour\\" with Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki is happening. Honestly, I’m kind of relieved to see the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic hour go. Skunk Fu!, as quirky as it is, never really felt like the right lead-in for Chaotic. The tone just didn’t match, and it always seemed a bit disjointed. It worked much better when it was paired with something like Horrid Henry, where the transition felt a lot smoother and the audience overlap seemed more natural. Here’s how the new lineup is looking: 07:00 AM GoGoRiki 07:30 AM Skunk Fu! 08:00 AM Huntik 08:30 AM Sonic 09:00 AM The Spectacular Spider-Man 09:30 AM Dinosaur King 10:00 AM Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer 10:30 AM Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s It really seems like they’re aiming to create distinct blocks within the overall lineup to cater to different tastes, with the “Animal Hour” serving as a light-hearted, comedic break from the more intense action that surrounds it. I’m actually looking forward to seeing how it pans out. More than anything, I’m glad the network is exploring diverse programming strategies to keep the Saturday morning tradition alive and interesting. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please Joined Sep 30, 2005 Messages 28,860 Location The Grid August 29, 2008 #34 I have to agree on the relief of seeing the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic pairing ending. The two shows just never meshed well in terms of audience or tone. The \\"Animal Hour\\" feels like a clever pivot towards creating a more cohesive viewing experience, especially for younger audiences or those looking for something more light-hearted. The rest of the lineup looks solid too. It’s a good mix of adventure, action, and humor that could really appeal across the board. Plus, it’s nice to see programs like The Spectacular Spider-Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer getting spotlights. Those could really anchor the lineup with strong viewership numbers. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE Joined Sep 27, 2005 Messages 2,302 Location USA August 29, 2008 #35 The new lineup definitely seems to be playing to the strengths of each show, and it’s great to see the network taking creative risks with the “Animal Hour.” It’s a smart way to diversify the programming while keeping a thematic link between shows. This could really help in building a strong identity for CW4K!DS as a block that offers a bit of everything. I’m particularly excited about the mix of returning shows and new additions. This lineup feels like a new era for CW4K!DS, and it’ll be interesting to see how viewers respond. If the “Animal Hour” can find its footing, it might set a precedent for more thematic programming blocks in the future. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator Joined Aug 19, 2006 Messages 2,662 Location Maine, USA August 29, 2008 #36 The shift towards the “Animal Hour” and the restructuring of the lineup seems like a positive move in refreshing the CW4K!DS block. It shows they're thinking about how different shows complement each other to keep the audience engaged throughout the morning. The blend of humor, action, and adventure seems well-balanced, and I’m here for it. Saying goodbye to the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic pairing is a welcome change. It always felt like a bit of an odd couple, and this new approach feels like it could be a lot more cohesive. Overall, the new lineup has me optimistic about the future of Saturday morning cartoons.

It’s a bold move, but it makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Following up Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s with Jackie Chan Adventures adds a strong one-two punch to the later morning slot, capturing both the action-oriented audience and those craving a bit of comedic relief. This revival is a testament to the timeless appeal of Jackie Chan Adventures and its ability to draw viewers. There's a real strategy in tapping into the nostalgia of older viewers while introducing the series to a new generation.

It's a beloved series that spans across multiple age groups, ensuring that older fans relive their childhood while newer, younger fans get to experience its magic for the first time. This reshuffle genuinely positions CW4K!DS as a formidable contender for the best Saturday morning lineup, balancing new hits with tried-and-true classics.

It’s a show that encapsulates everything great about the early 2000s animation scene—dynamic action sequences, engaging storylines, and humor that lands just right. Placing it right after Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s is a stroke of genius, offering viewers a seamless transition from high stakes card battles to adventurous martial arts mayhem. CW4K!DS is clearly pulling out all the stops, signaling they’re not playing it safe. Instead, they’re crafting a lineup that’s both a nod to the golden era of Saturday mornings and a beacon for the future of weekend cartoons.

This stream network is crucial for understanding how water flows within the watershed. - **Sub-basin Delineation:** By analyzing the stream network and the topography, Arc Hydro can delineate sub-basins, providing a detailed hierarchical sub-watershed structure. These sub-basins are essential for detailed hydrologic analysis in HEC-HMS. - **Catchment and Watershed Characterization:** Arc Hydro tools help in delineating catchments and assigning relevant hydrologic information to them, such as slope, area, and land use/land cover data. This characterization is critical for understanding the hydrologic response of different parts of the watershed. # 2. **Developing Inputs for HEC-HMS:** - **Hydrologic Parameters:** Using the watershed characteristics derived from Arc Hydro, parameters such as time of concentration, curve numbers (for the SCS Curve Number method), and initial abstraction can be estimated. These parameters are fundamental for the rainfall-runoff calculations in HEC-HMS. - **Cross-sections and Profiles:** For river analysis, Arc Hydro can help in extracting cross-sectional data from the DEM, which can be used in defining the geometry of river channels for hydraulic models in HEC-HMS. - **Precipitation and Land Use Data:** Arc Hydro can assist in integrating spatial precipitation data and land use/land cover data, which are necessary for setting up the precipitation models and understanding how land use changes affect runoff characteristics. - **Time-series Data:** Through integration with other GIS datasets or databases, Arc Hydro can help organize and manage time-series data (like rainfall or flow data) that are required as input for continuous simulation or event-based models in HEC-HMS. # 3. **Integration with HEC-HMS:** Once the characterization and parameterization are completed in Arc Hydro, the data need to be exported and formatted correctly for use in HEC-HMS. This often involves exporting spatial data into HEC-HMS compatible formats or using middleware applications that facilitate data transfer between ArcGIS and HEC-HMS. In summary, Arc Hydro provides a comprehensive suite of tools for watershed analysis and modeling, offering a systematic way to characterize watersheds and generate the hydrologic and hydraulic inputs necessary for sophisticated models like HEC-HMS. This not only streamlines the modeling process but also enhances the accuracy and reliability of hydrologic assessments and forecasts."},{"prompt":"a little bit more detail","completion":"Certainly! Let's delve into a bit more detail on how Arc Hydro tools are utilized for watershed characterization and the development of inputs for HEC-HMS, focusing on the sequence of steps and methodologies involved. # 1. **Detailed Watershed Delineation and Characterization:** - **Pre-processing of Digital Elevation Model (DEM):** The first step involves cleaning and preparing the DEM to remove any sinks or errors that might affect the flow of water. This step is critical for ensuring that the derived flow direction and flow accumulation are accurate. - **Flow Direction and Flow Accumulation:** Using the processed DEM, Arc Hydro calculates the flow direction (the direction water will flow in each cell of the DEM) and flow accumulation (how much water accumulates as it flows over the surface). These are foundational in identifying potential stream channels and watershed boundaries. - **Stream Definition and Network Generation:** The flow accumulation data is then used to define where streams occur. A threshold of accumulated flow is set to distinguish between upland areas and stream channels. This threshold is somewhat arbitrary and may be adjusted based on the scale and specific hydrologic characteristics of the area being studied. Stream segments are delineated and linked to form a comprehensive network, forming the basis for further hydrologic analysis. - **Sub-basin Delineation and Characterization:** With the stream network defined, Arc Hydro can delineate the contributing areas, or sub-basins, for each stream segment. It divides the watershed into smaller, manageable units, each draining to a specific outlet. Characteristics such as area, perimeter, slope, and aspect of these sub-basins are computed to understand the hydrologic behavior and to create input parameters for HEC-HMS models. - **Catchment Delineation:** Additionally, detailed catchment areas are delineated around the stream network, providing finer spatial resolution of hydrologic response units. Land use, soil type, and other physiographic data are then overlaid to characterize each catchment in terms of runoff potential and hydrologic response. # 2. **Developing Inputs for HEC-HMS:** - **Hydrologic Parameter Estimation:** With the watershed and sub-basins delineated and characterized, various hydrologic parameters such as Curve Numbers (CN) for runoff computation, Lag time, or Time of Concentration for each sub-watershed or catchment area can be calculated. Soil type and land use data from sources like the SSURGO database and the NLCD (National Land Cover Database) are used in conjunction with Arc Hydro tools to derive these parameters. - **Importing Cross-sections and Profiles for Hydraulic Analysis:** For simulations that require hydraulic analysis, cross-sectional data extracted from the DEM can be used to define the geometry of rivers and channels in HEC-HMS. This includes width, depth, and slope, which are crucial for studying flow dynamics and floodplain mapping. - **Spatial and Temporal Precipitation Data Integration:** Arc Hydro facilitates the spatial analysis of precipitation data, which can be used to create gridded precipitation inputs for HEC-HMS. This involves assigning precipitation values to each sub-basin or catchment based on spatial interpolation techniques or directly using radar rainfall data. - **Time-series Data Management:** Hydrologic modeling with HEC-HMS often requires continuous time-series data (such as precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration) for long-term simulations. Arc Hydro assists in organizing and formatting this data, ensuring that it matches the spatial and temporal requirements of the HEC-HMS model. # 3. **Integration with HEC-HMS:** - **Data Export and Conversion:** Once the watershed has been fully characterized and the necessary parameters have been calculated, the information needs to be exported from ArcGIS and formatted for HEC-HMS. This may involve using the HEC-GeoHMS extension for ArcGIS, which directly facilitates the creation of HEC-HMS input files from ArcGIS data. - **Model Setup in HEC-HMS:** With all the inputs prepared, the HEC-HMS model can be set up by defining the basin model (with sub-basins, junctions, reaches, and reservoirs), specifying the meteorological model (for precipitation inputs), and setting up control specifications (defining the simulation period and time-step). The detailed preparation and analysis capabilities of Arc Hydro, combined with HEC-HMS, provide a powerful toolset for hydrologic study and flood risk management. This integrated approach allows for more accurate modeling of watersheds, prediction of hydrologic responses, and preparation for flood events."},{"prompt":"do the same for this: develop an event hydrology model in HEC-HMS for the Little Sackville River.

Below is a breakdown of the process, focusing on configuring the HEC-HMS model with the specific methods mentioned: # 1. **Project and Basin Model Setup in HEC-HMS** First, you need to initiate a new project in HEC-HMS and create a basin model. This involves defining the geographical settings and time zone of your project, which for the Little Sackville River would be consistent with its actual location. # 2. **Subbasin Delineation and Representation** Using GIS data (possibly processed through the Arc Hydro toolset as described in previous insights), delineate the subbasins of the Little Sackville River. Each subbasin will be represented in the HEC-HMS model and will require specific parameters based on the hydrology of the area. # 3. **Subbasins Configuration** For each subbasin in the Little Sackville River watershed, configure the following components in HEC-HMS: - **Green and Ampt for the Loss Method:** You’ll need to specify the initial conditions including the initial and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the wetting front suction head, and the initial moisture deficit. This information might come from soil maps, soil moisture monitoring data, or literature. - **SCS Unit Hydrograph for the Transform Method:** Determine the lag time or time of concentration for each subbasin. This often requires knowing the shape, slope, and size of each subbasin. The SCS Unit Hydrograph transforms rainfall excess into runoff and is widely used for its simplicity and ease of parameter estimation. - **Recession for the Baseflow Method:** This method simulates the groundwater contribution to streamflow during dry weather. Define parameters such as the initial discharge and recession constants that best fit the observed baseflow recession curves for the Little Sackville River. - **Simple Canopy:** This component models interception of rainfall by vegetation. Parameters include the storage depth of the canopy and canopy evaporation rate. These are determined based on the type of vegetation cover in each subbasin. - **Simple Surface:** This method addresses depression storage and the impervious area. Parameters to define include depression storage depth and the percentage of the impervious area within the subbasin. # 4. **Reach Configuration** Each reach connecting the subbasins needs to be configured for routing the flow through the river network: - **Lag Method for Routing:** This method simulates the translation of the flood wave through the reach without accounting for attenuation. Define the lag time for each reach, which represents the time it takes for a flood wave to travel from the upstream end of the reach to the downstream end. # 5. **Meteorological Model Setup** Create a meteorological model to apply rainfall data to your event model. This can be specified using either gage data or hypothetical storm events based on historical data. - Import or input the precipitation data for the storm event you are modeling. Ensure the temporal resolution is adequate to capture the peak and volume accurately for the type of storm being simulated. # 6. **Simulation and Calibration** Once all parameters are set and the model is fully configured, run the simulation for the event you are analyzing. - **Calibration**: Compare the simulated results with observed data, if available, and adjust the parameters accordingly to improve the model's accuracy. This might involve iterative adjustments of parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity for the Green and Ampt method or the lag time for the SCS Unit Hydrograph and reach lag methods. - **Validation**: After calibration, run the model with a different event to validate its accuracy. This detailed setup allows for a sophisticated representation of hydrologic processes in the Little Sackville River watershed. Keep in mind the importance of calibration and validation with observed data to ensure the model accurately reflects the real-world hydrology of the area."},{"prompt":"same for this: Provide a graphical comparison of measured vs simulated flows for the event. b. Provide goodness of fit measures (NSE, PBIAS, RSR) for the calibrated model and a brief","completion":"In conducting hydrological studies or model evaluations, comparing measured (observed) flows with those simulated by models like HEC-HMS is a critical step in understanding model performance. Here’s how you might graphically compare the two and assess the model using goodness-of-fit measures: # Graphical Comparison of Measured vs. Simulated Flows 1. **Collect Data:** Ensure you have the observed flow data for the event period and the corresponding simulated flow data from the HEC-HMS model. 2. **Prepare the Data:** Both datasets should be formatted similarly, with matching time steps (e.g., hourly, daily) to ensure a fair comparison. 3. **Create a Time Series Plot:** Using software like Excel, R, or Python, create a time series plot that displays both the measured and simulated flows on the same graph. Time should be on the x-axis, and flow (in cubic meters per second, cfs, or any other relevant unit) should be on the y-axis. - Plot the measured flow as a continuous line or as points connected by lines. - Plot the simulated flow possibly with a different color or line style to easily distinguish it from the measured data. - Include a legend that clearly indicates which line represents the measured data and which represents the simulated data. 4. **Visual Analysis:** Analyze the plot by observing: - How well the peaks (high flows) and troughs (low flows) of the simulated data align with the measured data. - The timing of the peak flows — a common issue is correct magnitude but incorrect timing. - The overall shape of the hydrograph, looking at the rising limb, peak, and recession limb. # Goodness of Fit Measures After visually comparing the flows, quantitatively evaluate the model's performance using the following goodness-of-fit measures: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) - **Definition:** NSE assesses the predictive power of hydrological models, with values ranging from -∞ to 1, where 1 represents perfect match between measured and simulated data. - **Formula:** [ text{NSE} = 1 - frac{sum_{i=1}^{n}(Q_{m,i} - Q_{s,i})^2}{sum_{i=1}^{n}(Q_{m,i} - bar{Q}_m)^2} ] where (Q_{m,i}) is the measured flow, (Q_{s,i}) is the simulated flow, and (bar{Q}_m) is the average of the measured flows. Percent Bias (PBIAS) - **Definition:** PBIAS measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts. The optimal value is 0.0, with low-magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation. - **Formula:** [ text{PBIAS} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{n}(Q_{m,i} - Q_{s,i}) times 100}{sum_{i=1}^{n}Q_{m,i}} ] Ratio of the Root Mean Square Error to the Standard Deviation of Measured Data (RSR) - **Definition:** RSR standardizes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by the observations' standard deviation, offering a normalized metric of model performance. - **Formula:** [ text{RSR} = frac{sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n}(Q_{m,i} - Q_{s,i})^2/n}}{sigma_{Q_m}} ] where (sigma_{Q_m}) is the standard deviation of the measured data. # Brief Analysis In the analysis, discuss how well the model performed relative to the expected outcomes. For example: - **NSE Closer to 1:** Indicates that the model can explain most of the variance in the observed data. - **Low PBIAS Values:** Reflects that the model does not consistently overestimate or underestimate the observed flows. - **RSR Closer to 0:** Suggests that the RMSE is small relative to the standard deviation of observed data, indicating good model performance. It's also essential to contextualize the goodness-of-fit measures within the specific application of the model. For instance, in a highly variable hydrological environment, slightly lower NSE values might still represent an acceptable model performance. Also, consider discussing any systematic biases observed in the graphical comparison and how they might be addressed in model refinement."},{"prompt":"do the same for Penman-Monteith Equation","completion":"The Penman-Monteith equation is a widely used method to estimate the evapotranspiration (ET) rate from a reference crop surface, essentially grass or alfalfa.

Its applications in these fields revolve around understanding the components of the hydrological cycle, specifically how ET impacts the availability of water in rivers and streams for various uses, including agriculture, urban supply, and environmental flows. Here's how the equation is integrated into streamflow analysis and water allocation processes: # Streamflow Analysis 1. **Catchment Hydrology:** In catchment hydrology, ET is a critical component of the water balance equation. The Penman-Monteith equation helps in calculating the actual amount of water vapor returned to the atmosphere from both plant transpiration and soil evaporation. This is essential for understanding the volume of water that will eventually contribute to river flow after precipitation. 2. **Modelling Hydrological Processes:** Hydrological models that simulate river basin processes integrate ET estimates to predict streamflow under different climatic scenarios. The accuracy of ET estimation, therefore, directly influences streamflow predictions and the planning of water resource utilization. 3. **Climate Change Impact Studies:** ET rates are sensitive to changes in temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity. The Penman-Monteith equation, by incorporating these meteorological variables, helps in assessing the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow patterns, enabling water managers and researchers to analyze trends and variability in water availability. # Water Allocation 1. **Agricultural Water Demand:** The Penman-Monteith equation is heavily employed in calculating the water requirements of crops at different stages of growth. This information is pivotal for planning irrigation schedules and quantities, ensuring that water allocation for agricultural purposes is optimized to meet crop needs without over-extracting from streams and rivers. 2. **Sustainable Water Use Planning:** Understanding ET is vital for developing sustainable water management plans. By accurately quantifying how much water is lost to the atmosphere, water resource managers can better allocate the remaining water among various sectors, including domestic, industrial, and environmental needs, ensuring that streamflows remain at levels sufficient to support ecosystem health. 3. **Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM):** In the context of IWRM, the Penman-Monteith equation aids in the holistic management of water resources by providing essential data for evaluating the balance between water demand and supply. Accurate ET estimations ensure that water allocations are made in a manner that supports both human and ecological needs, contributing to the overall resilience and sustainability of water resource systems. 4. **Determining Environmental Flows:** Environmental or ecological flows refer to the quantity, timing, and quality of freshwater flows necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems. By incorporating ET estimates from the Penman-Monteith equation into water balance analyses, policymakers can ensure that water allocations consider the natural requirements of riverine ecosystems, helping to maintain their functionality and biodiversity. # Conclusion While the Penman-Monteith equation is fundamentally an ET estimation tool, its broader utility in streamflow analysis and water allocation underscores its importance in integrated water resource management. By providing a mechanism to quantify one of the significant outflows in the hydrologic cycle, it enables more informed and sustainable decision-making regarding how water is shared, used, and conserved across different sectors and ecosystems."},{"prompt":"more detail. like the steps","completion":"To integrate the Penman-Monteith equation into streamflow analysis and water allocation more methodically, let's delve into the detailed steps involved in these processes.

When constructing a flow duration curve (FDC) in Minitab based on 7-day low flow data, or any streamflow data, several key parameters and statistical concepts come into play. Although Minitab doesn’t have a direct function to generate a flow duration curve in a single step, you can utilize its statistical and graphical capabilities to analyze the flow data and prepare the necessary outputs for constructing an FDC. Here’s a closer look at the parameters and processes involved: # 1. **Streamflow Data Ranking:** The primary set of data you need is the series of flow measurements, which you’ve specified as 7-day low flow data. The essential step here is to rank this data from highest to lowest, as a flow duration curve represents the percent of time a certain flow rate was equaled or exceeded during the period of record. - **Percentile Calculation:** To create an FDC, you need to calculate the percentile ranks of the flow data. In Minitab, this can be achieved by using the \\"Rank and Percentile\\" feature under the \\"Stat > Nonparametrics\\" menu. The percentile rank tells you what percent of the total observations fall below a specific value. # 2. **Data Sorting and Transformation:** - **Descriptive Statistics:** Basic descriptive statistics such as minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles of the streamflow data can be easily obtained via Minitab. These statistics are useful for understanding the distribution and variability of the streamflow. - **Data Manipulation:** You may need to transform your flow data or manipulate it to format it correctly for plotting. Minitab offers a wide range of data manipulation tools that allow reshaping the dataset as needed. # 3. **Plotting the FDC:** - **Customization of Graphs:** To plot an FDC in Minitab, you will typically use a scatterplot or a line plot from the “Graph” menu, plotting the ranked flow data on the Y-axis against its corresponding percentile exceedance on the X-axis. The FDC is essentially a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of flows, shown in reverse order. - **Logarithmic Transformation:** Often, the flow data is plotted on a logarithmic scale, especially if the range of flows is wide. Minitab allows you to easily apply logarithmic scaling to the axes of your plot to better visualize the flow distribution characteristics. # 4. **Analysis and Interpretation:** - **Trend Analysis:** If interpreting how streamflows might be changing over time is part of your analysis, then using Minitab’s trend tests (like Mann-Kendall) on your ranked flow data can be insightful. - **Comparative Analysis:** Flow duration curves generated for different periods or scenarios can be compared within Minitab to assess changes in flow availability or the impact of water management strategies. # 5. **Contextual Parameters:** Beyond the raw flow data, constructing a meaningful FDC in Minitab might also consider external factors or parameters such as: - **Seasonality:** Analyses of seasonal variations in flow, which can be addressed by filtering data for specific months or seasons before ranking. - **Water Use and Allocation:** Information on water withdrawals, returns, and legal/environmental flow requirements might inform the interpretation of the FDC but would generally be analyzed outside Minitab and brought in for contextual interpretation. # Conclusion: Creating a flow duration curve in Minitab involves a blend of data ranking, percentile computation, and graphical representation, all supported by Minitab's statistical analysis features. While the direct output is a graphically represented FDC, the insights gained regarding flow variability, exceedance probabilities, and potential impacts of anthropogenic or natural changes on water availability are invaluable for water resource management. Remember, the value of the FDC lies in its interpretation and the context-specific insights it provides for managing streamflows and allocating water resources sustainably."},{"prompt":"i want the steps on how to do it","completion":"Creating a Flow Duration Curve (FDC) in Minitab from 7-day low flow data, or any streamflow data, involves manipulating and analyzing the data to construct a graph that shows the percentage of time during which specified flow rates are equaled or exceeded. Minitab doesn't have a dedicated tool for creating FDCs directly, but you can use its statistical and graphical capabilities to construct one. Here are the detailed steps: # Step 1: Prepare Your Data 1. **Enter Your Data**: Input your streamflow data into a Minitab worksheet. Ensure your data is organized with dates in one column and flow values in another. # Step 2: Rank Your Flow Data 1. **Sort Data**: Sort your flow data in descending order. You can do this by selecting \`Data > Sort\` and choosing to sort in descending order based on your flow data column. 2. **Calculate Exceedance Probabilities**: - Create a new column next to your sorted flow values for exceedance probabilities. - Use the formula \`(Rank/N) * 100\` to calculate the exceedance probability for each flow value, where \`Rank\` is the rank order of the data point (1 for the highest flow), and \`N\` is the total number of data points. - In Minitab, you can manually enter rank numbers or use \`Calc > Row Statistics\` to assign ranks. For calculating exceedance probabilities, you might need to use \`Calc > Calculator\` to apply the formula. # Step 3: Graph Your Data 1. **Scatter Plot**: Now that you have your flow data sorted and exceedance probabilities calculated, go to \`Graph > Scatterplot\`. Choose the simple scatter option. 2. **Set Up Your Axes**: - For the X-axis, select the column that contains your exceedance probabilities. - For the Y-axis, select the column containing your flow values. - Since flow duration curves typically have the flow on the Y-axis and the exceedance probability on the X-axis in log scale, adjust the scale of the X-axis to logarithmic if needed by right-clicking on the axis in the graph editor and choosing \`Scale > Log Scale\`. # Step 4: Customize Your FDC 1. **Formatting**: Within the graph editor, you can further format your graph for presentation. This includes adding axis labels (\\"Exceedance Probability\\" for the X-axis and \\"Flow\\" for the Y-axis), a title, and modifying any other stylistic elements. 2. **Log Transformation (Optional)**: If not already applied, you can convert the X-axis or Y-axis to a logarithmic scale to better display the data, which is particularly useful if your data spans several orders of magnitude. # Step 5: Interpretation and Analysis 1. **Analyze the FDC**: The resulting plot is your Flow Duration Curve. The curve allows you to understand how often flows of different magnitudes occur. For example, you can find the flow that is exceeded 90% of the time, which could be important for setting baseline environmental flow requirements. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: If you have created multiple FDCs for different time periods or scenarios, you can compare them to assess trends or the impact of management actions. # Additional Tips - Remember, the key to a meaningful FDC lies in accurate data and thoughtful interpretation of the results. Consider the influence of external factors such as seasonal variations, land use changes, and water withdrawal on flow patterns. - For complex analyses or very large datasets, Minitab's scripting capability can automate parts of the process, saving time and reducing the potential for manual error. By following these steps, you can effectively use Minitab to analyze streamflow data and generate Flow Duration Curves that provide critical insights for water resource management, planning, and conservation efforts."},{"prompt":"im talking about steps for example setting up distribuitons and transformations","completion":"Creating a Flow Duration Curve (FDC) in Minitab by involving distribution fitting and data transformation entails a more detailed process that leverages Minitab’s statistical tools. Although Minitab isn't inherently designed for hydrology-specific tasks like FDC creation, its capabilities can be adeptly applied to conduct the necessary statistical analysis. Below are the refined steps to incorporate aspects of distribution fitting and transformations: # Preparing Data for FDC Creation Step 1: Data Import and Preliminary Checks 1. **Import Data**: Launch Minitab and input your daily or 7-day low flows into a worksheet. 2. **Explore Data**: Use \`Stat > Basic Statistics > Display Descriptive Statistics\` to check the data for any inconsistencies, missing values, and to obtain a preliminary understanding of your dataset. Step 2: Data Sorting and Ranking 1. **Data Sorting**: To sort your flow data in descending order, use \`Data > Sort\`, selecting your flow data column as the sort variable. Ensure the order is set to descending. 2. **Rank Calculation**: Add a new column in your Minitab worksheet to calculate the ranks. While Minitab doesn’t provide an explicit rank function for this purpose, you can manually input the ranks for your dataset based on your sorted flow data or craft a rank formula using \`Calc > Calculator\`. # Constructing the Flow Duration Curve Step 3: Calculate Exceedance Probabilities 1. **Exceedance Probabilities Formula**: In a new column, calculate the exceedance probabilities using the formula: \`(Rank / (N+1)) * 100\`, where \`Rank\` is the rank of each data point (starting with 1 for the highest), and \`N\` is the total number of data points. - Utilize \`Calc > Calculator\` for applying the formula across the dataset. Step 4: Distribution Fitting and Transformation (Optional) 1. **Evaluate Flow Distributions**: To determine if a transformation is necessary, you might first assess the distribution of your flow data via \`Stat > Basic Statistics > Graphical Summary\`. 2. **Apply Transformations**: If data transformation is needed (e.g., log transformation for normalization), use \`Calc > Calculator\` and apply a transformation function like \`ln(Column)\` for log transformation. Step 5: Generate the Flow Duration Curve 1. **Creating the Scatter Plot**: Navigate to \`Graph > Scatterplot\`. This is where we diverge from typical use cases for scatter plots in Minitab. Choose the 'With Regression' option if you prefer a smoothed curve through your points, which isn't standard for FDCs but can provide insights. 2. **Configuring Plot Data**: - **X-axis (Exceedance Probability):** Select the column with your calculated exceedance probabilities. Remember, this axis often uses a logarithmic scale in FDCs. - **Y-axis (Flow Rates):** Choose your (optionally) transformed flow data column. 3. **Adjusting Axes**: Double-click on the X-axis to adjust settings. Set the scale to ‘Logarithmical’ if it aligns with your data presentation preference. Ensure the Y-axis reflects the flow values accurately, adjusting for any transformations applied. 4. **Labeling and Final Touches**: Add axis labels and a graph title for clarity. Label the X-axis as \\"Exceedance Probability (%)\\" and the Y-axis as \\"Flow Rate (unit)\\" or similar, depending on the transformations used and data context. # Post-Plotting Analysis After plotting, it’s crucial to interpret the curve correctly. Key points of interest on an FDC include flows that are exceeded a high percentage of the time (indicative of baseflow conditions) and those exceeded less frequently (reflective of high-flow events). # Additional Notes: - **Frequency Analysis**: Minitab’s capability can extend to comparing different distributions or assessing the goodness-of-fit, which could further refine how you interpret and use your FDC. - **Scripting in Minitab**: For repetitive analyses or to streamline your FDC creation, exploring Minitab’s scripting language can automate tasks, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. This procedural guide aligns with Minitab's vast analytical capacities, demonstrating its utility beyond conventional statistical applications, and towards specialized, hydrologically relevant undertakings like creating Flow Duration Curves with a mindful consideration of distribution assessments and data transformations."},{"prompt":"how does the model do the Streamflow Analysis and Water Allocation. like what principals would it use","completion":"When discussing the principles behind streamflow analysis and water allocation using models (whether software like Minitab is involved for statistical analysis, or more specialized hydrology and water resource management tools), it's essential to understand the foundation upon which these analyses are built. While Minitab itself is not a hydrological modeling tool, the underlying principles for streamflow analysis and water allocation are universally applied across various modeling platforms. Here’s how these principles are generally encapsulated: # Principles of Streamflow Analysis: 1. **Hydrologic Cycle Understanding**: Understanding the components of the hydrologic cycle (precipitation, evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff, and storage) is fundamental. Models simulate parts of or the entire hydrologic cycle to predict how water moves through a watershed. 2. **Catchment Characteristics**: Models consider catchment or watershed characteristics, including land use, soil type, topography, and vegetative cover, as these factors significantly influence how water is absorbed, stored, and transported. 3. **Water Balance Equation**: The water balance equation, (P = Q + ET + I + ΔS), where (P) is precipitation, (Q) is streamflow, (ET) is evapotranspiration, (I) is infiltration, and (ΔS) is the change in storage (including groundwater), is a core principle for both analysis and modeling efforts. This equation ensures the conservation of mass is maintained in simulation models. 4. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical analysis of historical streamflow data helps in identifying patterns, trends, and variability in streamflows. Techniques might involve frequency analysis, trend tests, and flow duration curves (FDC), crucial for understanding the behavior of a stream under different conditions. 5. **Flow Regime Classification**: Understanding the natural flow regime (e.g., perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral streams) and how it might be impacted by human activities or climate change is essential in analyzing streamflows and predicting future conditions. # Principles of Water Allocation: 1. **Demand Assessment**: Quantifying current and future water demands from various sectors (agricultural, municipal, industrial, environmental) is crucial. This involves both consumptive and non-consumptive uses. 2. **Supply and Availability Analysis**: Evaluating the availability of surface water and groundwater resources, considering both the quantity and quality of available water. This also involves understanding the temporal variability and reliability of water sources. 3. **Prioritization and Legal Frameworks**: Water allocation models must adhere to local, regional, and international laws and agreements that dictate water rights, priorities among users, and environmental flow requirements. 4. **Scenario Modeling and Risk Analysis**: Models use different scenarios (e.g., climate change scenarios, land use change, population growth) to assess risks and uncertainties in water availability and demand. This is important for planning purposes and ensuring long-term water security. 5. **Sustainability and Equity Principles**: Ensuring equitable access to water resources while maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems is a guiding principle in water allocation. Models often include sustainability indices and criteria to evaluate the impact of allocation decisions. 6. **Economic and Social Considerations**: The economic value of water in different uses and the socio-economic impacts of water allocation decisions are also considered, aiming to optimize benefits while minimizing negative impacts. 7. **Adaptive Management**: Given the uncertainties and changing conditions, water allocation models and strategies often incorporate adaptive management principles, allowing for flexibility and adjustments as new information becomes available or conditions change. # Conclusion: Streamflow analysis and water allocation rely on a multidisciplinary approach, blending hydrology, environmental science, law, and social sciences. While specific models and tools might be designed for detailed simulation and prediction tasks, the principles guiding these analyses encompass a broad understanding of hydrologic processes, system dynamics, and human and ecological needs."},{"prompt":"how is HBV light used for HBV-Light for continuous simulation of streamflow","completion":"HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning) Light is a user-friendly version of the HBV hydrological model, designed to simulate streamflow and other hydrological processes in a watershed continuously. The HBV model was originally developed in Sweden in the 1970s and has since been widely used for water resource assessment, flood forecasting, and climate change impact studies. HBV Light offers an accessible interface and a simplified setup that makes it attractive for a wide range of users, including researchers, consultants, and decision-makers in water resource management. Its core components include routines for snowmelt, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, runoff, and routing. Here’s how HBV Light is typically used for continuous simulation of streamflow: # Setting Up HBV Light for Continuous Streamflow Simulation 1. **Preparation of Input Data:** Before running HBV Light, you must prepare and input data that represent the physical characteristics of the catchment area and meteorological variables. This includes: - **Meteorological Time Series:** Such as precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and in some cases, radiation, humidity, and wind speed. - **Catchment Characteristics:** Area, elevation, slope, land use, soil types, and other relevant geographical information. 2. **Model Configuration and Calibration:** - **Parameterization:** Configure the model parameters that control the processes in each of the model’s components. These parameters are catchment-specific and often require calibration using observed streamflow data for accurate simulation. - **Snow Module:** Parameters define how snow accumulates and melts. - **Soil and Evapotranspiration Module:** Settings for field capacity, root zone storage, and coefficients for potential evapotranspiration calculations. - **Runoff Generation Module:** Thresholds and response time for runoff generation from different water sources (surface, soil, and groundwater). - **Routing Module:** Parameters that control the delay and attenuation of runoff as it moves through the catchment to the outlet. - **Calibration:** Use observed streamflow data to calibrate the model. This means adjusting model parameters until the simulated streamflow aligns as closely as possible with observed data over a specific period. Calibration can be done manually or using automated optimization algorithms available in or outside HBV Light. 3. **Running the Model:** With parameters set and the model calibrated, run HBV Light over the desired simulation period. The model uses the input meteorological time series to calculate daily or sub-daily (depending on the time step chosen) streamflow at the catchment outlet. 4. **Validation and Sensitivity Analysis:** After calibration, it is crucial to validate the model by comparing its simulations to observed streamflow data for a different period, ensuring that the model performs well under various conditions. Sensitivity analysis can also be conducted to understand how sensitive simulation results are to changes in model parameters. 5. **Continuous Simulation and Scenario Analysis:** HBV Light can then be used for continuous simulation under different scenarios, such as climate change projections, land use changes, or water management strategies, allowing assessment of potential impacts on streamflow and water resources. # Applications - **Water Resource Planning:** By simulating how catchments respond to varying climatic and land use conditions, water resource managers can identify potential future water supply and demand imbalances. - **Flood Risk Assessment:** Continuously simulating streamflows helps in identifying periods of high flood risk, aiding in flood management and response planning. - **Climate Change Impact Studies:** HBV Light can simulate hydrological changes in response to different climate change scenarios, helping to assess vulnerability and adaptability of water resources. # Conclusion HBV Light, through its streamlined approach to continuous hydrological simulation, serves as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting streamflow dynamics. By integrating meteorological data and catchment characteristics into a process-based modeling framework, it enables detailed analysis and scenario planning for effective water resource management and planning strategies."},{"prompt":"which GPt are you?","completion":"I am a model based on OpenAI's technology, designed to assist with providing information, answering questions, and performing tasks based on text input.

Below are some of the most essential elements needed to craft a convincing and well-structured argument: 1. **Thesis or Claim**: Every argument revolves around a central claim or thesis. This should clearly state the position you are arguing for. It acts as the foundation of your argument. 2. **Evidence and Support**: To persuade your audience of your position, you'll need to provide evidence supporting your claim. This could include statistics, findings from studies or research, historical examples, expert testimonials, or logical reasoning. 3. **Reasoning**: Apart from presenting evidence, you'll need to explain how this evidence supports your claim. This involves logical reasoning which connects the dots between your evidence and the argument you are making. 4. **Structure**: A well-organized structure is crucial. Generally, an argument starts with an introduction that presents the claim, followed by body paragraphs that each present a piece of evidence and its explanation. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the argument and reinforces the claim. 5. **Counterarguments and Rebuttals**: Acknowledging and addressing opposing views strengthens your argument. Present the counterarguments and provide rebuttals to show the weaknesses in those positions or explain how they can be overcome. 6. **Clarity and Precision**: Being clear and precise in your language and definitions ensures that your audience understands your argument and the terms involved. Avoiding ambiguities or misunderstandings is key to convincing others of your stance. 7. **Appeals**: Effective arguments often use a mix of appeals to logic (logos), emotion (pathos), and credibility (ethos). Balancing these appeals can enhance the persuasiveness of your argument. 8. **Audience Awareness**: Tailoring your argument to your audience is crucial. Understanding their values, beliefs, and potential biases can help you frame your argument in a way that is more likely to persuade them. Combining these elements thoughtfully can help you establish a comprehensive, convincing argument on virtually any topic."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in medieval Europe of a 10ft tall, blonde German farmer washing washing himself off waist-deep in a pond, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

This was no ordinary man; this was Heinrich, the German farmer, renowned across the land not just for his crops, but for his towering presence. Standing at an awe-inspiring height of 10 feet, with locks of gold that cascaded down his broad shoulders like the golden rays of dawn, Heinrich was a sight to behold. On this fateful day, as the amber hues of the setting sun danced upon the serene waters of the pond, Heinrich decided it was time for his ritual cleansing. With each step toward the water, the earth itself seemed to tremble beneath his feet. As he disrobed, revealing a physique sculpted like the statues of the gods of old, a hush fell over the land, as if nature itself paused to admire this embodiment of human perfection. Yet, for all his statuesque beauty, Heinrich was blissfully unaware of his effect on the world. He waded into the water, the level rising significantly with his entry, until he was waist-deep in the cool embrace of the pond. As he stood there, the water lapping against his sun-kissed skin, he ran his hands through his thick, blond hair, sending droplets flying like liquid diamonds in the waning light. But our tale takes a turn from the divine to the decidedly human, as Heinrich, feeling the natural call that spares no man, regardless of stature, decided to indulge in a moment of levity. \\"Ah,\\" he said to himself, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. \\"Nothing like a good release to make a man feel at one with nature.\\" With that, he pushed, and the tranquility of the moment was shattered by a sound so thunderous, it echoed off the hills surrounding the pond. Birds took flight in alarm, and a small wave rippled through the water. Heinrich looked down with a hearty laugh, as bubbles surfaced around him, the product of his monumental effort. \\"By Odin's beard, that was a mighty one!\\" Heinrich exclaimed, a wide grin spreading across his face. As he reveled in the aftermath, something caught his eye—several fish floated to the surface of the pond, victims of the noxious plume that had enveloped them. Heinrich, ever the pragmatist, saw an opportunity. \\"Waste not, want not,\\" he chuckled, plucking the fish from the water. \\"Looks like it's fish for dinner tonight.\\" As he contemplated his unexpected catch, Heinrich couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Not only had he cleansed himself, but he'd also secured a meal in the process, all thanks to a release of guttural proportions. \\"I suppose every cloud—or in this case, every bubble—has a silver lining,\\" he mused, making his way out of the pond, his muscular form glistening in the fading light. \\"Ah, life is good for this simple farmer.\\" And so, with his bountiful harvest of fish in hand, Heinrich strolled back to his cottage, his laughter echoing into the twilight, a testament to the joy found in life's simpler pleasures. He left behind a pond forever changed, a small village in awe, and a story that would be told for generations—of the day nature itself was momentarily vanquished by the sheer force of human flatulence."},{"prompt":"what is the teraflops in gpus?","completion":"A teraflop is a measure of a computer's speed and can be used to express the performance of graphics processing units (GPUs) among other types of processors. Specifically, it refers to the ability of a processor to calculate one trillion floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). \\"Tera-\\" is a prefix meaning a trillion, hence teraflops translate to a trillion FLOPS. In the context of GPUs, teraflops are often used to gauge the computational power of the GPU for tasks such as gaming, scientific calculations, deep learning, and graphics rendering.

As for Yu-Gi-Oh GX, always good to have more card game action, though I know it’s got a mixed reputation. It’s a shame about Horrid Henry though; it had a unique charm. Still, the schedule looks promising, and I’m particularly excited for the new TMNT episodes. Hoping this brings some fresh energy to Saturday mornings. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 18, 2008 #13 I have to agree on the new additions doing well, especially TMNT: Fast Forward. It has a loyal fanbase, so ratings shouldn’t be an issue. Glad to see The Spectacular Spider-Man keeping its spot, it’s easily the best thing on this lineup. Yu-Gi-Oh GX will undoubtedly please the TCG crowd. Sad to see some of the departures, but that’s the business, I guess. Here’s hoping the newcomers can maintain or even boost viewership for CW4K!DS. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 18, 2008 #14 Mixed feelings here. Excited for Chaotic and the others, but it’s kind of a letdown to lose Horrid Henry. Johnny Test and Eon Kid leaving was expected but still a bit of a loss, content-wise. This new lineup certainly seems geared towards a more action-oriented audience, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Curious to see how it all pans out rating-wise come fall.

Skunk Fu! has its moments, but I thought Johnny Test had a solid fan base, and Horrid Henry certainly had its unique charm. It’s interesting to see what the network decides is worth keeping and what’s not. Anyone else puzzled by this decision? Or does Skunk Fu! have a bigger following than I’m aware of? It seems like a quirky choice, especially given how competitive these slots are becoming with the new additions.

Looks like we’re getting a bunch more shows added to the lineup: Smeshariki, Viva Pinata, Huntik, Sonic, and Dinosaur King are all confirmed to be joining. Not to mention, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s and TMNT: Back to the Sewer are making their way to our screens as well. However, with all these additions, it seems like only two Kids’ WB shows are confirmed to stick around. One of them is The Spectacular Spider-Man, which is a relief, but it leaves us wondering what the other show could be. Any guesses or wishes on what it should be? CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 1, 2008 #17 That’s a loaded lineup! Happy to see more variety coming to CW4K!DS, especially with the inclusion of Sonic and Dinosaur King. Those could draw in quite the crowd. The introduction of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s and TMNT: Back to the Sewer is sure to shake things up too. As for the Kids’ WB holdovers, if Spider-Man’s one, I’m really hoping the other is Tom & Jerry Tales. It’s classic and has universal appeal. Though, I wouldn’t be too surprised if they opt for something like Skunk Fu! again due to its unique style. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 1, 2008 #18 The new additions sound exciting! I’m particularly looking forward to seeing what Huntik is all about. Also, Sonic always has a dedicated fanbase, so that’s a smart move. Agreed on hoping the second show that sticks around is Tom & Jerry Tales. It’s a timeless classic that appeals to pretty much everyone. But regardless, this new lineup suggests CW4K!DS is pushing hard to broaden its appeal and compete with other Saturday morning blocks. bigddan11 Justice must be served! JoinedNov 11, 2003 Messages29,929 LocationOdessa, TX August 1, 2008 #19 These new shows are a bold move for CW4K!DS, aiming to blend nostalgic favorites with fresh faces. Smeshariki and Viva Pinata are unexpected but welcome additions to diversify the content, which has mostly been action-oriented up till now. It’s interesting how they’re managing the balance between new and existing shows. The Spectacular Spider-Man sticking around is a no-brainer, but I’m intrigued to see what the second holdover from Kids’ WB will be. I have a soft spot for Ben 10, but I’m not holding my breath. D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 1, 2008 #20 With every new announcement, CW4K!DS seems to be cementing its position as a Saturday morning staple. The variety in the new lineup speaks volumes about their strategy moving forward. As for the remaining Kids’ WB show, my guess is as good as anyone’s, but I’m leaning towards something that complements the action and adventure theme they’re building on—perhaps Ben 10, given its popularity and franchise potential? Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how these changes impact the overall viewership and if these new additions can capture the audience’s imagination as the network hopes. Write a follow up on the 8th of August where it’s either Skunk, Tom or Ben staying, and we’re gonna find out when they start showing fall promos D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 8, 2008 #21 Hey everyone, the latest word on CW4K!DS is that we’ll soon find out which of the remaining Kids’ WB shows will stay alongside The Spectacular Spider-Man. Looks like it’s down to Skunk Fu!, Tom & Jerry Tales, and Ben 10. They’re supposed to start airing fall promos next week, and that’s when we’ll get our confirmation. The anticipation’s killing me! Each of these shows has its own unique draw. Skunk Fu! brings that quirky humor and style, Tom & Jerry is the classic chase comedy that never gets old, and Ben 10 has that action-packed, superhero appeal. Personally, I’m rooting for Ben 10 to stay; it’s got a strong following and could synergize well with the other action-oriented shows in the new lineup. What’s everyone hoping for? Any predictions based on the new direction CW4K!DS seems to be heading in? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 8, 2008 #22 Man, this is a tough call. Each show appeals to different segments of the audience. I’d say Tom & Jerry Tales has the broadest appeal given its legacy, but CW4K!DS seems to be leaning a bit more into the action/adventure vibe lately. That makes me think Ben 10 has a strong shot. Either way, it’s going to be interesting to see which direction they decide to lean into. Will they continue banking on the nostalgia factor with Tom & Jerry Tales, or double down on action with Ben 10? Can’t wait for those promos to drop! CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 8, 2008 #23 I’m betting on Tom & Jerry Tales sticking around. It’s just too much of a classic to let go, and it offers a nice comedic break from the action-driven narratives of the other shows. Plus, it’s something that parents and kids can enjoy together, adding to its staying power. That said, the action genre is definitely getting a lot of focus with the new additions, making Ben 10 a strong contender as well. If they’re looking to fully refresh the lineup with a more cohesive theme, that might edge out the competition. Guess we’ll find out soon enough with those promos. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 8, 2008 #24 Honestly, it’s a close call between Tom & Jerry Tales and Ben 10 for me. Both have strong arguments for staying. Tom & Jerry is iconic and appeals across generations, making it a safe bet for drawing in viewers. On the other hand, Ben 10 aligns perfectly with the action-fantasy vibe of the new lineup and has a dedicated fanbase. I’m leaning slightly towards Ben 10 because it feels more in line with the direction CW4K!DS is taking, but I wouldn’t count out Tom & Jerry Tales just yet. It’s going to be an interesting reveal, for sure! Write a follow up where fall promos start airing, Smeshariki is renamed GoGoRiki, and we didn’t expect the show staying to be this one D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 15, 2008 #25 Well, the fall promos for CW4K!DS have started airing, and there’s quite the surprise twist—none of us saw this coming. First off, a quick note: Smeshariki has been renamed GoGoRiki. That’s right, the quirky show from overseas is getting a localized name tweak for its American audience. But here’s the real shocker: out of Skunk Fu!, Tom & Jerry Tales, and Ben 10, the show that’s sticking around is… Skunk Fu!. I know, right? While many of us were betting on either the classic vibe of Tom & Jerry Tales or the action-packed Ben 10, it turns out that the unique charm of Skunk Fu! has earned it a spot in the revamped lineup. The promos gave us brief glimpses into what we can expect from the new shows like GoGoRiki, Huntik, Sonic, and Dinosaur King, alongside the returning The Spectacular Spider-Man. They’re really leaning into a diverse mix of adventure, humor, and action. With Skunk Fu! staying, it seems CW4K!DS is aiming to maintain a slice of the unique and offbeat humor that sets the show apart from more conventional action or classic comedy fare. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 15, 2008 #26 Definitely didn’t see Skunk Fu! being the show to stay. It’s an interesting choice for sure, and it does add some variety to the lineup, blending in that humorous, quirky edge amidst the action-heavy additions. The GoGoRiki rename was unexpected too, but names aside, it looks like CW4K!DS is gearing up for a season with a lot of fresh flavors. Now that we know Skunk Fu! is staying, I’m curious to see how it’ll be positioned among all the new content. Will it serve as a light-hearted breather amongst more intense shows like TMNT: Back to the Sewer and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s? Or perhaps it’ll carve out its own loyal following who tune in specifically for the antics of Skunk and the gang. Either way, Fall is shaping up to be an interesting season for CW4K!DS. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 15, 2008 #27 Skunk Fu!, huh? Now that’s a curveball. Guess it shows CW4K!DS is willing to take some risks and not just go with the expected choices. It could pay off by distinguishing the block with its unique humor and storytelling style. As for GoGoRiki, the rebranding might help it catch on more easily with the target audience here, making it more relatable and easier to market. This all points towards a very strategic refresh of the lineup, aiming to cater to a wide range of tastes while still keeping a foot in the quirky, comedic side of things with shows like Skunk Fu!. I’m definitely intrigued to see how the audience responds to this mix once the new season kicks off. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 15, 2008 #28 Well, Skunk Fu! taking the spot truly was the wild card in this whole shake-up. It shows that CW4K!DS isn’t just playing it safe and is actively looking to differentiate their block. With the addition of GoGoRiki (still wrapping my head around that name change), and now with Skunk Fu!’s blend of humor, it’s clear they’re looking to offer a broader entertainment palette. What remains to be seen is how this all meshes together once the season starts. Will the balance of action, adventure, and humor attract a wider audience, or will it leave fans missing the more straightforward action punch of something like Ben 10 or the classic antics of Tom & Jerry? Only time will tell, but it’s shaping up to be a season full of surprises. Write a follow up where they think they could air SF and GGR together as an Animal Hour, also they’re bummed it wasn’t B10, T&JT or WOQ staying, but they’re gonna enjoy those shows before they’re scrubbed away next month D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin August 22, 2008 #29 Had a bit of a brainstorm after watching the latest promos—what if CW4K!DS is planning to pair Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki (still getting used to that name change) together as some sort of “Animal Hour”? Thematically, it makes sense. Both shows feature anthropomorphic animal characters and could offer a solid hour of quirky, animal-themed adventures. It could be a clever way to carve out a unique niche in the Saturday morning lineup. As much as I’m bummed that it wasn’t Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, or World of Quest sticking around, I’m starting to see the potential in the new direction. Still, it’s going to be hard saying goodbye to those shows next month. I guess we’ll just have to enjoy them while we can, huh? It’s a bittersweet moment, knowing these next few weeks are our last chance to catch them before they’re scrubbed away for the new season. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 22, 2008 #30 The “Animal Hour” idea sounds pretty plausible and could be a smart move for CW4K!DS. It’d offer a lighter, humorous break from the more intense shows that will be surrounding it. Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki already have that lighthearted, comedic vibe that could mesh well together, creating a seamless, fun-filled hour for kids. And yeah, it’s a shame about Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest. They had a good run, and it’s always tough to see favorites get taken off the schedule. I’ll definitely be making the most of these next few viewings. Here’s hoping the new content manages to fill those shoes and then some. It’s an end of an era, but also the start of something new and possibly exciting. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 22, 2008 #31 The more I think about it, the “Animal Hour” could be a strategic move to appeal to a younger audience while still keeping the content light and accessible. Pairing Skunk Fu! with GoGoRiki creates a thematic continuity that could really work in CW4K!DS’s favor. It seems like they’re thinking outside the box, which could pay off. As much as we’ll miss Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest, I guess change is the only constant in the world of television. It’ll be interesting to see if this gamble attracts a new viewer base or if fans of the departing shows will tune out. Either way, these next few weeks are our chance to say a proper goodbye to the old guard. Let’s savor it. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 22, 2008 #32 “Animal Hour” could indeed add a fresh twist to Saturday mornings. There’s a charm to Skunk Fu! and GoGoRiki that, when combined, could offer something distinctive and engaging for the audience. It’s clever programming if that’s the route they decide to go. Losing Ben 10, Tom & Jerry Tales, and World of Quest is tough, though. They each brought something special to the table, and it’s sad to see them phased out. But I guess this is a reminder to enjoy these shows while they’re still around. Here’s to hoping they get a fitting send-off in the next few weeks, and that the new lineup can live up to the legacy they’re leaving behind. Change is always hard, but who knows? Maybe this “Animal Hour” will become the new favorite for many.

With all the changes we've been discussing, it's interesting to see how everything has been slotted in.

Then, moving into a more diverse mix with something for everyone from adventure seekers in The Spectacular Spider-Man and Sonic to the TCG enthusiasts with Chaotic rounding it out before TMNT: Back to the Sewer caps the morning. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid September 5, 2008 #34 This new lineup definitely showcases a wide array of genres. Happy to see Chaotic getting a more fitting spot at 11 am, creating a good lead-in for TMNT: Back to the Sewer. The “Animal Hour” with GoGoRiki and Skunk Fu! is a playful way to kick things off, appealing directly to the younger crowd. I’m particularly excited about The Spectacular Spider-Man and Sonic—both have solid fanbases and deliver on the action and adventure fronts. Huntik is a bit of a wildcard for me, but given its positioning, it seems to bridge the transition from fantasy adventure to the strategic gameplay of Chaotic quite nicely. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA September 5, 2008 #35 The new lineup seems like a strategic blend of humor, action, and adventure, which could really work in CW4K!DS’s favor. It's interesting to see a move towards thematic blocks, with the early focus on humor transitioning into more adventure and fantasy-based shows. Chaotic's move to 11 am is also a smart decision. It acts as a nice segue into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer, providing a solid one-two punch of action and strategy that could keep viewers engaged right until noon. All in all, CW4K!DS seems to be really stepping up their game with this new schedule. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA September 5, 2008 #36 The balance in the new lineup looks promising. Starting off with lighthearted, comedic shows like GoGoRiki and Skunk Fu! makes for a gentle lead into the morning, potentially capturing a younger audience from the get-go. I’m especially pleased with how they've positioned shows to gradually build up to more intense, action-oriented programming. It's a pity we had to say goodbye to some of the old favorites, but this fresh lineup seems like it could bring something new and exciting to the table. The strategic placement of Chaotic before Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer could keep viewers hooked and round off the morning on a high note.

It never quite felt right, did it? The tonal shift between the two was always a bit jarring—going from the whimsical, humorous world of Skunk Fu! directly into the complex, competitive environment of Chaotic just didn't mesh well. Thankfully, the introduction of Viva Pinata into the schedule has resolved this issue brilliantly. Positioning Viva Pinata after Skunk Fu! creates a much smoother transition in terms of content and tone. Both shows embrace a more lighthearted, fun-filled approach to their storytelling, making the progression into the more adventure and action-oriented shows like The Spectacular Spider-Man and Sonic much more cohesive. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid September 12, 2008 #38 Absolutely, the Skunk Fu! and Chaotic mash-up was a headscratcher for a lot of us. It's like trying to mix oil and water—two fundamentally different properties that just refuse to blend. The inclusion of Viva Pinata as a buffer of sorts is a game changer. It delicately walks the line between whimsy and adventure, making it a perfect bridge between the imaginative chaos of Skunk Fu! and the more strategic depth of Chaotic. This revised structure makes for a much more enjoyable viewing experience. I think it'll make it easier for kids (and, let's be honest, adults too) to stay glued to the TV, comfortably transitioning from one show's energy to the next without the abrupt thematic shifts we were dealing with before. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA September 12, 2008 #39 The Skunk Fu!-Chaotic combination was one of those experiments that sounded good on paper but just didn't translate well in practice. Now that Viva Pinata has taken its rightful place in the lineup, bridging the gap between Skunk Fu!'s goofiness and the more intense, plot-driven narratives that follow, the whole morning feels more unified. It’s clear now that Viva Pinata is the missing piece that was needed to round out the early morning segment. Its vibrant, animated world not only complements Skunk Fu!'s humor but also gently ushers viewers towards the excitement and drama of the shows that follow. CW4K!DS seems to have found its rhythm, making for a lineup that’s both entertaining and sensibly structured. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA September 12, 2008 #40 I’m glad I’m not the only one who felt the disconnect in the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic pairing. Moving Chaotic to a later slot and bringing in Viva Pinata was a clever move by CW4K!DS. Viva Pinata, with its colorful, engaging world full of fun and adventures, fits perfectly with the vibe following Skunk Fu!. It's these subtle scheduling nuances that can really make or break a viewer's experience. With Viva Pinata now smoothing the transition, the lineup feels more coherent, maintaining the upbeat, adventurous spirit without the abrupt mood swing that the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic shift used to bring.

It felt like the end of an era, and I found myself quite nostalgic. Does anyone have the specifics on which episodes aired that day? I’d love to know, especially for Ben 10 and Tom & Jerry Tales, as they’ve been staples of Saturday mornings for so long. It's a transition period for sure, and while I understand the need to refresh content and keep things engaging for viewers, parting with these shows is bittersweet.

I managed to catch the Magi-Nation and World of Quest episodes, but I missed out on Tom & Jerry Tales and Ben 10. From what I recall, the Magi-Nation episode was one of the later ones from the series—a great choice for its last showing, really highlighting how far the show developed in its narrative depth. As for World of Quest, it was also one of the latter episodes, if I'm not mistaken. It’s sad to see it go; the humor and adventure combo was always a good start to the morning.

As for Ben 10, I believe they aired an episode from the \\"Original Series\\" lineup—fitting, considering it laid the groundwork for the entire franchise.

I caught the episode of Ben 10 they decided to air, and it was definitely from the original series. An excellent choice that takes us back to where it all began for Ben, Gwen, and Max. It was kind of a reflective choice, considering the transitions we’re facing with the CW4K!DS lineup now. Regarding Tom & Jerry Tales, ending on a classic episode was a respectful nod to the timeless nature of the series. It reminds us why it's been beloved for so many generations.

It was quite the significant episode to end on, considering it encapsulates so much of what made Ben 10 a cornerstone of our Saturday mornings: action, heroism, and the importance of family and teamwork. \\"Secrets\\" was a fantastic choice for the final airing, serving almost as a love letter to the fans who've been there from the very beginning. It highlighted the origins of Ben's journey and set the tone for his future adventures. No doubt, it was a bittersweet farewell to a series that has sparked countless imaginations and spawned an entire franchise of sequels, spin-offs, and movies. The choice of \\"Secrets\\" for Ben 10’s last hurrah on CW4K!DS really brings home how impactful the series has been for viewers over the years.

This was no ordinary farmer; oh no, for he stood a towering ten feet tall, with a mane of golden hair that cascaded down his broad, sun-kissed shoulders like rays of sunlight piercing through the clouds. His physique was the stuff of legends, muscles rippling under his fair skin, sculpted through years of tilling the earth and wrestling with the obstinate oxen. But of all the splendid vistas, perhaps none was as majestic as his bountiful butt, each cheek a testament to his hearty German diet and rigorous farming lifestyle. One serene afternoon, after a long day's toil under the scorching sun, our farmer, whom we shall call Hans, decided it was time for a bath. Disrobing, he stepped into the lake, the cool water lapping at his waist. Hans submerged himself, his blonde hair flowing around him like golden threads in the water. And then, he turned, presenting the world with a rear view of his glorious gluteus maximus as he prepared for a moment of sheer relief. With a hearty chuckle, Hans announced to the unsuspecting woodland creatures, \\"Ah, what a moment of bliss awaits me!\\" With a look of concentration and a playful grin, he put in a bit of effort and unleashed a fart of monumental proportions into the serene waters. The bubbles rose, popping merrily as they broke the surface, a testament to Hans’ hearty and robust constitution. \\"Oh, ho! What a sensation!\\" Hans exclaimed with a hearty laugh, his voice echoing through the trees, startling a flock of birds into flight. The water around him rippled in response to his outburst, and then, to his amazement and delight, a few fish floated up, belly-up, apparently suffocated by the sheer potency of his emission. \\"Well, would you look at that!\\" Hans marveled, his eyes twinkling with mischief and mirth. \\"My rear has turned hunter!\\" He plucked the fish from the water, examining them closely. \\"Hmm, to cook or not to cook, that is the question. What a feast ye could provide, thanks to my mighty wind!\\" Contemplating his unexpected catch, Hans decided, \\"Ah, waste not, want not, as the saying goes. These beauties shall grace my table tonight.

Under the vast expanse of this old-world heaven, lived a man, nay, a legend, by the name of Heinrich der Riese—a 15-foot-tall blonde farmer whose presence was as formidable as his appetite. One summer’s eve, as the sun dipped low, bathing the land in a golden hue, Heinrich decided it was time for his bi-monthly wash. Clad in nothing but his God-given suit, he made his way to the nearest lake, a body of water that had seen more of Heinrich than any maiden in the land. His hair, a cascade of golden wheat, spilled down his mountainous back, shimmering in the sunlight. His physique was that of mythic proportion—muscles upon muscles, sculpted from years of tilling fields and wrestling the odd unruly cow or two. Now, our dear Heinrich, though a giant among men, was a simple soul who found joy in the most basic of life's pleasures. As he waded waist-deep into the cool embrace of the lake, he let out a sigh of contentment, feeling the grime of hard labor wash from his skin. “Ah, das ist gut,” Heinrich murmured to himself, scrubbing vigorously at a day’s worth of sweat and soil. The water around him whirled with suds and sediment, a testament to the earnestness of his efforts. And then, as Heinrich reached the pinnacle of his cleansing routine, he felt a burgeoning pressure within. A cheeky grin spread across his face. He looked around, ensuring he was alone, not that anyone could miss his colossal frame. Satisfied with his solitude, he cocked one leg slightly, a giant among giants, poised in all his glory. With a push and a concentrated face that would do any bard’s portrayal of strain justice, Heinrich let out a thunderous fart, the bubbles rushing to the surface in a fervent bid for freedom. The birds took flight. Somewhere, a horse whinnied in protest. The very lake seemed to shudder around him. “Ha! Take that, Fischlein!” Heinrich chortled, watching as a few unfortunate fish belly-flopped to the surface, victims of his gaseous onslaught. His laughter boomed across the hills, echoing through the valleys like a jovial storm. “Who needs a net or a rod, when you’ve got these?” He glanced down at his posterior with pride. Then, scratching his head, Heinrich surveyed the aftermath of his aquatic assault—a veritable feast floating before him. “Nun, what’s the harm? A man’s got to eat,” he mused, wading through the water to collect his catch. “And they say beans are the magical fruit. Ha! They have yet to witness the power of a giant’s breeze.” With that, Heinrich, a gentle giant with a wind capable of marine massacre, waddled out of the lake, fish in hand, ready to feast. And so it was, in a far-off land where tales intertwine with reality, that a farmer made dinner in the most unconventional of fashions. “Tonight, we dine like kings! Or at least, like a very, very big man,” Heinrich declared to no one in particular, setting about his task with a happiness that only such simplicity could bring. Thus concludes the peculiar tale of Heinrich der Riese, a story whispered on the wind, through the hills and dales—a reminder of the days when giants roamed the earth, and a fart could yield a feast fit for a king, or at the very least, a rather oversized farmer."},{"prompt":"D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin September 5, 2008 #33 Alright, the new CW4K!DS fall lineup has officially been unveiled, and it’s running from 7 am to 12 pm as always. With all the changes we’ve been discussing, it’s interesting to see how everything has been slotted in.

Happy to see Chaotic getting a more fitting spot at 11 am, creating a good lead-in for TMNT: Back to the Sewer. The “Animal Hour” with GoGoRiki and Skunk Fu! is a playful way to kick things off, appealing directly to the younger crowd. I’m particularly excited about The Spectacular Spider-Man and Sonic—both have solid fanbases and deliver on the action and adventure fronts. Huntik is a bit of a wildcard for me, but given its positioning, it seems to bridge the transition from fantasy adventure to the strategic gameplay of Chaotic quite nicely. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA September 5, 2008 #35 The new lineup seems like a strategic blend of humor, action, and adventure, which could really work in CW4K!DS’s favor. It’s interesting to see a move towards thematic blocks, with the early focus on humor transitioning into more adventure and fantasy-based shows. Chaotic’s move to 11 am is also a smart decision. It acts as a nice segue into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer, providing a solid one-two punch of action and strategy that could keep viewers engaged right until noon. All in all, CW4K!DS seems to be really stepping up their game with this new schedule. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA September 5, 2008 #36 The balance in the new lineup looks promising. Starting off with lighthearted, comedic shows like GoGoRiki and Skunk Fu! makes for a gentle lead into the morning, potentially capturing a younger audience from the get-go. I’m especially pleased with how they’ve positioned shows to gradually build up to more intense, action-oriented programming. It’s a pity we had to say goodbye to some of the old favorites, but this fresh lineup seems like it could bring something new and exciting to the table. The strategic placement of Chaotic before Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer could keep viewers hooked and round off the morning on a high note. Let’s hope this new direction pays off for CW4K!DS!

It never quite felt right, did it? The tonal shift between the two was always a bit jarring—going from the whimsical, humorous world of Skunk Fu! directly into the complex, competitive environment of Chaotic just didn’t mesh well. Thankfully, the introduction of Viva Pinata into the schedule has resolved this issue brilliantly. Positioning Viva Pinata after Skunk Fu! creates a much smoother transition in terms of content and tone. Both shows embrace a more lighthearted, fun-filled approach to their storytelling, making the progression into the more adventure and action-oriented shows like The Spectacular Spider-Man and Sonic much more cohesive. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid September 12, 2008 #38 Absolutely, the Skunk Fu! and Chaotic mash-up was a headscratcher for a lot of us. It’s like trying to mix oil and water—two fundamentally different properties that just refuse to blend. The inclusion of Viva Pinata as a buffer of sorts is a game changer. It delicately walks the line between whimsy and adventure, making it a perfect bridge between the imaginative chaos of Skunk Fu! and the more strategic depth of Chaotic. This revised structure makes for a much more enjoyable viewing experience. I think it’ll make it easier for kids (and, let’s be honest, adults too) to stay glued to the TV, comfortably transitioning from one show’s energy to the next without the abrupt thematic shifts we were dealing with before. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA September 12, 2008 #39 The Skunk Fu!-Chaotic combination was one of those experiments that sounded good on paper but just didn’t translate well in practice. Now that Viva Pinata has taken its rightful place in the lineup, bridging the gap between Skunk Fu!'s goofiness and the more intense, plot-driven narratives that follow, the whole morning feels more unified. It’s clear now that Viva Pinata is the missing piece that was needed to round out the early morning segment. Its vibrant, animated world not only complements Skunk Fu!'s humor but also gently ushers viewers towards the excitement and drama of the shows that follow. CW4K!DS seems to have found its rhythm, making for a lineup that’s both entertaining and sensibly structured. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA September 12, 2008 #40 I’m glad I’m not the only one who felt the disconnect in the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic pairing. Moving Chaotic to a later slot and bringing in Viva Pinata was a clever move by CW4K!DS. Viva Pinata, with its colorful, engaging world full of fun and adventures, fits perfectly with the vibe following Skunk Fu!. It’s these subtle scheduling nuances that can really make or break a viewer’s experience. With Viva Pinata now smoothing the transition, the lineup feels more coherent, maintaining the upbeat, adventurous spirit without the abrupt mood swing that the Skunk Fu!-Chaotic shift used to bring.

It's the end of an era, and while it's sad to see it go, the changing lineup seems to promise a lot of fresh excitement for the viewers. The network seems eager to keep things dynamic and ensure there’s always something new to look forward to. And speaking of changes, did anyone else catch that ad for Chaotic's new timeslot during the last airing? They definitely leaned into the shift with a creative twist—having a character bid farewell to Tom Majors by saying, \\"We weren't meant for each other.\\" A humorous nod, perhaps, to Chaotic's move away from its jarring juxtaposition with Skunk Fu!, thus solidifying its own identity within the CW4K!DS schedule. It’s these little details and efforts at continuity that really highlight the thoughtfulness going into the programming shake-up, making the transition smoother and a bit more fun for the audience. It’s always a gamble changing established lineups and saying goodbye to beloved characters and shows, but these moves might just be what CW4K!DS needs to keep its audience engaged and coming back for more.

This behemoth of a farmer, known as Big Klaus to the few who didn't sprint away in terror, stood a towering thirty feet tall, with muscles bulging like the hillsides and hair cascading down his back like the golden wheat fields at sunrise. His blonde locks, a testament to his Nordic roots, shimmered even in the dusk light as Big Klaus decided it was time for his monthly bath. The scene was a secluded lake, nestled between towering oaks and whispering willows, which hardly seemed ready for what was about to descend upon it. Big Klaus, in his all-together, waded waist-deep into the water, sending ripples dancing playfully across the surface. As he submerged his massive frame, fish of every size scattered in panic, foreseeing the looming tide of turmoil. As he washed, Big Klaus hummed tunes of yore, his deep voice echoing off the valley walls, probably scaring some distant herdsmen into thinking a storm was brewing. His mane, fully drenched, clung to his broad back, outlining muscles that looked as though they could wrestle a dragon into submission—or at least into a very respectful conversation. Then, in a moment of primal necessity, Big Klaus felt the urge to release a bit of internal pressure. With a cheeky (pun intended) grin on his face, he positioned himself for optimum effect. As he exerted himself, a bubble rose to the surface of the lake with a zeal that betrayed its foul mission. The resulting sound was not unlike the horn of Gondor, if it played at a rather indelicate pitch. \\"Ah, das ist gut,\\" Big Klaus chuckled to himself, as he admired the ripples fanning out from the epicenter of his release. A few moments passed, the surface of the lake once again calm, until something rather unexpected occurred—a few unfortunate fish floated belly-up, their last breaths taken in service of bearing witness to Klaus's digestive might. Big Klaus, ever the opportunist, eyed the fish with a curious mix of guilt and culinary appreciation. \\"To cook, or not to cook, that is the Frage,\\" he mused aloud, scratching his head with a hand the size of a shovel. \\"Ah, who am I kidding? Waste not, want not, as Mother used to say.\\" With that, he scooped up the ill-fated fish and waded back to shore, his backside gleaming under the moonlight like the proud banner of an advancing army, victorious in its odd endeavor. Each step ashore seemed to say, 'Here walks Big Klaus, conqueror of lakes, terror of fish, and soon, perhaps, master chef.' As he set about starting a fire, the night air filled with the aroma of cooking fish—a small feast in memory of a battle won, not with sword or shield, but with a mighty wind. \\"Well,\\" he pondered aloud, turning a fish over the flames, \\"they always say, 'You are what you eat.' I suppose tonight, I dine on bravery.\\" And in the distance, the trees whispered to each other of the legend of Big Klaus, certain that tales of this night would ripple through the annals of history, much like the effects of his epic flatulence upon the waters of that secluded lake."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in medieval Europe of a 30ft tall, blonde German farmer washing washing himself off waist-deep in the ocean, in the buff (describe his hair, physique and butt).

Oh, Heinrich wasn't your typical farmer. For starts, he was the height of six oxen stacked on top of each other, with a mane of golden hair that cascaded down his back like a wheat field ready for harvest. His physique was that of a man who clearly did not skip \\"bale lifting day,\\" his muscles rippling like the Rhine River itself, and each of his buttocks resembled two enormous, perfectly round boulders that even the bravest mountain goats refused to scale. One serene day, finding himself grimier than a boar after truffle hunting, Heinrich decided to venture towards the ocean for a little dip. \\"Ze dirt, it clings to me like a lovesick maiden,\\" he lamented, in a voice that caused the birds to cease their chirping and the fish to swim in curious circles. As he disrobed, the sun kissed his pallid, moon-like buttocks, casting a glow that could be seen for leagues. Heinrich waded into the water, the ocean barely reaching his waist, sighing in content. Now, bear in mind, this was no ordinary day at the beach. Oh no. Heinrich fancied a bit of...release. Flexing his gargantuan glutes, he prepared to unleash a fart that could rival the bellowing of a dragon. With a cheeky grin, he pushed, sending forth a sound that echoed off the mountains like a tempest. The water around him rippled, the very fabric of the ocean disturbed by the sheer force of his flatulence. And then, from the depths below, dead fish began to surface. \\"Ach, look at that! Meine majestic gas hath provided a bounty,\\" Heinrich proclaimed with a chuckle, admiring the deceased sea creatures that floated up around him. The stench was, to put it mildly, otherworldly. Yet, Heinrich, with a nostalgic sniff, remarked, \\"Ah, just like Mutti's cooking.\\" Surveying the unexpected harvest, Heinrich pondered aloud, \\"Sollen I cook them for mein dinner? A feast gifted by the gods of the wind,\\" he mused, scratching his beard which housed a small ecosystem. \\"Ach, but of course! To waste such a gift would be unforgivable. I shall invite the entire village! We shall dine like kings and queens, regaled by the tale of how these fish met their demise.\\" Thus, Heinrich, with a heart as large as his derrière, set to work. That evening, the villagers gathered, feasting on the \\"Windfall Fish\\" as they came to be known. The story of Heinrich's rear-end reckoning became the stuff of legend, told by bards far and wide, a tale of humor, generosity, and a tiny bit of environmental terror. And so, our tale concludes, with Heinrich, the giant, blonde farmer, earning a place in the annals of history, not just for his formidable size but for his ability to clear the ocean and fill the dining tables with nothing but the natural gifts bestowed upon him.

By the time we reached Chaotic's \\"Dawn of Perim Part One,\\" it felt like a natural progression into a more intense and complex narrative. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA September 6, 2008 #44 The skit was definitely a highlight, providing both closure and comic relief to the lineup transition. It’s encouraging to see such creativity in addressing programming shifts, giving both shows a proper send-off while engaging the audience. The careful episode selection for today’s lineup was evident, making each transition between shows feel intentional and fluid. From the playful antics in Viva Pinata’s “Candiosity” to the more mature themes in The Spectacular Spider-Man’s “Interactions,” viewers were taken on a gradually evolving journey that culminated with the strategic depths of Chaotic’s “Dawn of Perim Part One.” CW4K!DS really outdid themselves, creating a Saturday morning experience that was both cohesive and captivating."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up with last week's ep specifics, including the Ben 10 ep aired","completion":"D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin September 13, 2008 #45 Can you believe it’s been a week since the new lineup debuted? Time flies when you’re enjoying quality Saturday morning cartoons! Last week continued to build on the positive momentum with another fantastic selection of episodes that kept us all glued to our screens. Here are some specifics from last Saturday: - **GoGoRiki** aired the hilarious \\"Fitness Frenzy,\\" where Chiko invents a new exercise machine that promises to get everyone in shape with minimal effort, resulting in some unexpected chaos. - Immediately following was **Skunk Fu!** with \\"The Art of Dream Control,\\" where Skunk learns a valuable lesson about the importance of facing fears head-on rather than trying to avoid them. - **Viva Pinata** kept the laughs coming with \\"The Piñatas Must Be Crazy,\\" which showcased the piñatas trying to outdo each other in a series of increasingly ridiculous stunts. - Then, **The Spectacular Spider-Man** served up a mix of action and intrigue with \\"Survival of the Fittest,\\" where Spider-Man faces off against the Vulture in a battle that tests not only his physical abilities but his wits as well. - **Sonic** zoomed into action with \\"Fast Friends,\\" an episode that emphasizes the value of teamwork as Sonic and Tails must rely on each other to defeat Robotnik’s latest scheme. - **Ben 10** had an exciting episode called \\"Kevin 11,\\" adding a new layer of depth to the series. After a falling out with Grandpa Max and Gwen, Ben meets Kevin, a kid with the power to absorb energy. The two initially become friends, but Ben quickly learns the dangers of trusting someone who’s willing to use power for personal gain. This episode not only thrilled with its action sequences but also explored themes of trust, betrayal, and the consequences of choice. - Adventure and mystery kept rolling with **Dinosaur King** in \\"Dance Evolution,\\" where the D-Team discovers a new dinosaur in a most unexpected place, leading to an unusual dance-off with the Alpha Gang. - Rounding out a morning of thrills, **Chaotic**'s episode \\"Unexpected\\" pulled viewers into a strategic duel that tested friendships and alliances within the chaotic world, offering a mix of intense battles and strategic gameplay. The transition this week felt even more seamless, and it's clear from this lineup that CW4K!DS is committed to a mix of humor, action, adventure, and a touch of life lessons. The addition of Ben 10 into the mix has added another layer of action and moral complexity that has perfectly complemented the existing array of shows. Each episode was carefully chosen to maintain energy and engagement from start to finish, setting a standard for Saturday morning entertainment. The continuation of thematic blocks, paired with engaging story arcs like that of Ben 10's \\"Kevin 11,\\" has proven to be a winning strategy. Looking forward to what the next Saturday brings us!"},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

This can happen if the definition does not properly account for backtracking from the structure of the plus expression to construct the corresponding add expression. In Prolog, when you define a bi-directional predicate like \`add_to_plus_expr/2\`, you must ensure it can correctly operate in both \\"directions\\": not just converting from \`add\` to \`+\` expression, but also from \`+\` to \`add\` expressions. For the cases that caused the stack limit errors, the issue is likely due to the lack of a proper base or recursive case that handles the conversion when the target structure is known (\`+\` expressions) and the source structure (\`add\` expressions) needs to be inferred. To make \`add_to_plus_expr/2\` work correctly in both directions, you will need to ensure that both the first and the second arguments are pattern-matched appropriately, and that recursion deconstructs or constructs the expressions as needed. Consider revisiting the definition of \`add_to_plus_expr/2\` and ensuring that it avoids infinite recursion when trying to match or build expressions in the case where the second argument (the \`+\` expression) is provided but the first is not. In the tests that failed, the expressions like \`add_to_plus_expr(Z, 2 + 3)\` are trying to reverse-engineer an \`add\` expression from a \`+\` expression. This requires a mechanism to inspect the structure of the \`+\` expression and construct an equivalent structure using \`add\`, respecting the operations' associativity and arity (binary operations in this case). One way to approach this might be to explicitly handle ‘+’ and ‘*’ expressions differently in the \`add_to_plus_expr/2\` predicate, potentially using auxiliary predicates if necessary to cleanly separate the logic for each operation type. However, given the breadth of your implementation and the specific setup, a deeper redesign might be necessary for full bidirectional capability, noting the recursive exploration needed to construct equivalent expressions in all cases. Here's a quick example of how you might handle a specific case for reversing the process for a \`+\` operation: \`\`\`prolog add_to_plus_expr(X, Y + Z) :- add_to_plus_expr(X1, Y), add_to_plus_expr(X2, Z), X = add(X1, X2). \`\`\` Note: This snippet is a high-level idea to show handling of reversing for \`+\`, it might need further adjustments to seamlessly fit into your logic, especially considering associativity and precedence of operations when they get more complex. Similarly, handling for \`*\` and other operations would require additional cases."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},G={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],Y={key:0},R={key:1};function H(i,e,l,m,s,n){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>s.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,s.searchQuery]]),s.searchQuery?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>s.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",G,[(t(!0),o(w,null,v(n.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(t(),_(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),n.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),o("div",M,' No results found for "'+h(s.searchQuery)+'".
