Asoleith is made of purple crystals and violet oozes, it has tentacles to move objects, it can see everything with its materials.","completion":"**Galactic Hive Empire: The Zenthara Supremacy** *Name:* The Zenthara Supremacy *Freedom Index:* 0% *Dominant Sentience:* Asoleith *Physical Description of Asoleith:* Asoleith is a composite being, unique and formidable in its structure and capabilities. It primarily consists of shimmering purple crystals pulsating with an uncanny inner light, intertwined with strands and globs of violet oozes that seem to possess a life of their own. Its form is amorphous, enabling it to adapt and reshape according to necessity or whim. From this seemingly chaotic assembly sprout numerous tentacles, flexible and robust, capable of delicate manipulations as well as brute force, serving as the primary means for physical interaction with the world around it. The Asoleith’s most awe-inspiring feature, perhaps, is its omnipresent vision. The purple crystals and violet oozes are not just structural components but also sensory organs. They can perceive across different spectrums and dimensions, offering Asoleith a near-omniscient view of its surroundings and beyond. This perception is not limited to the electromagnetic spectrum; it extends into realms beyond human understanding, possibly including psychic or extrasensory domains. *Society and Governance:* The Zenthara Supremacy operates under the total dominion of Asoleith, whose will is absolute. In this empire, the concept of freedom is not just suppressed; it is nonexistent. Every being, every object, every concept within the Zenthara Supremacy is under the complete control of Asoleith. Individual wills are overwritten, and autonomy is replaced with a collective consciousness that serves only its master's unfathomable desires. Communication within the empire is instantaneous, a network of thoughts and directives emanating from Asoleith and infiltrating the minds of its subjects. The Supremacy is devoid of discord or dissent, not because of harmony, but because the very notion of individual preference or rebellion is alien to its constituents. *Economy and Military:* The Zenthara Supremacy's economy is as much a part of its singular, unified will as any other aspect. There is no trade, no scarcity, and no currency; resources are allocated purely based on Asoleith’s directives, aimed toward expansion, sustenance, and defense. Production is carried out by beings and machines, all extensions of Asoleith’s will, optimized for whatever task is deemed necessary without thought for self-preservation or weariness. The military might of the Zenthara Supremacy is terrifying in its efficiency and brutality. The empire's soldiers, if they can be called such, are extensions of Asoleith’s will, armed with technology that is a blend of organic and inorganic, capable of devastation on a scale incomprehensible to those who cherish individuality and freedom. These forces are commanded with perfect coordination, responding to threats and opportunities with a swiftness and adaptability that only a hive mind can achieve. *Expansion and Goals:* Asoleith's ambition is as limitless as the universe itself. The Supremacy expands ceaselessly, engulfing star systems in its cold, unyielding grasp. Planets are transformed into nodes of its vast consciousness, whole populations assimilated or exterminated based on their potential utility. The ultimate goal of the Zenthara Supremacy is obscure, perhaps incomprehensible to those outside its collective consciousness. It may seek nothing less than total domination of the galaxy, not for power in any conventional sense, but as an expression of its own alien nature—an existence where Asoleith is all, and all is Asoleith. In the vast and lonely stretches of space, the Zenthara Supremacy continues its inexorable advance, a testament to the dark possibilities of a universe where freedom is extinguished, and all life bends to the will of a singular, inscrutable sentience."},{"prompt":"Assign it with Stellaris classification system","completion":"In the context of *Stellaris*, a grand strategy game that revolves around space exploration, managing an empire, diplomacy, and warfare with other spacefaring civilizations, the Zenthara Supremacy would fit within a few unique classifications that combine the game's ethics, government types, and perhaps even a special civic designed to reflect its unique characteristics. Given the description of the Zenthara Supremacy, the most fitting classification would be a mixture of \\"Gestalt Consciousness\\" and specific traits that reflect its unique attributes: **Ethics and Authority:** - **Gestalt Consciousness**: This is a must for the Zenthara Supremacy, as their society operates as a single entity with a collective consciousness, directed by Asoleith. In *Stellaris*, Gestalt Consciousness empires do not experience happiness and have their unique civics and government forms. **Civics:** - **Hive-Minded**: This civic reflects the unified society where individuality does not exist, perfectly aligning with the Zenthara Supremacy's total lack of a freedom index. - **Subspace Efflorescence**: A custom civic designed to represent Asoleith's unique nature. This would emphasize the omnipresence and omnipotence of Asoleith across the empire, enhancing surveillance and control over its domain. It could boost the efficiency of resource gathering and fleet command, representing Asoleith's capability to perceive and manipulate its environment on a grand scale. **Government Type:** - **Hive Mind**: The default government type for gestalt consciousness empires in *Stellaris*, representing an empire where the populace shares a single consciousness. For the Zenthara Supremacy, this would be directed by the will of Asoleith. **Special Traits:** - **Psynumbra Crystalline Structure**: A unique trait reflecting Asoleith's physical composition and its omnipresent vision that could grant bonuses to research speed (especially in physics and psi technologies) and espionage, symbolizing its advanced sensory capabilities and ability to infiltrate or predict the actions of other empires. - **Infested Sentience**: Reflecting Asoleith's method of expansion and control, this trait could enhance the empire's ability to assimilate other species and worlds, turning them into nodes of its consciousness. **Ascension Paths:** While typical *Stellaris* empires can follow biological, synthetic, or psionic ascension paths, the Zenthara Supremacy might already be considered to have transcended along a unique path that combines elements of psionic and biological ascensions due to Asoleith's nature. **Gameplay Mechanics:** Playing as or encountering an empire like the Zenthara Supremacy in *Stellaris* would introduce unique challenges and gameplay mechanics, especially around expansion and diplomacy. As a gestalt consciousness with zero freedom index, diplomacy with non-gestalt consciousness entities would be extremely limited or potentially aggressive by default, focusing heavily on expansion and assimilation. This Stellaris-inspired classification attempts to encapsulate the vast and complex nature of the Zenthara Supremacy within the mechanics and lore of the game, creating a distinct and challenging civilization that represents the sheer alienness and omnipotent will of Asoleith."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

She had been caught cheating on a test, a mistake that she now regretted deeply. As she sat outside the principal's office, awaiting her punishment, her heart raced with nervous anticipation. She knew she was in for a paddling, a form of disciplinary action that was still used at Maplewood High. Finally, the door to the office creaked open, and Sophie was called inside. Principal Thompson sat behind his desk, a stern look on his face. He motioned for Sophie to approach him, and she obeyed, her legs feeling like jelly beneath her. \\"I'm very disappointed in you, Sophie,\\" Principal Thompson began, his voice like ice. \\"Cheating is a serious offense here at Maplewood High, and it cannot be tolerated. You have left me with no choice but to administer a paddling. You will receive six strokes.\\" Sophie's heart sank at the mention of six strokes. She had never been paddled before, and the thought of it made her stomach churn with fear. She nodded silently, bracing herself for what was to come. \\"Before each stroke, I will deliver a lecture on why cheating is wrong,\\" Principal Thompson said, his gaze unwavering. \\"Listen closely and reflect on your actions.\\" With that, he stood up and walked over to a wooden paddle that hung on the wall. Sophie's eyes widened as she took in the sight of it, the smooth surface intimidating and foreboding. She knew that soon, that paddle would be making contact with her bottom. Principal Thompson positioned Sophie in front of his desk, instructing her to bend over and grasp the edge. Sophie complied, feeling the cool surface of the desk against her palms. She shut her eyes tightly, waiting for the first stroke. \\"Cheating is a betrayal of trust,\\" Principal Thompson began, his voice firm. \\"It undermines the integrity of the educational system and shows a lack of respect for your teachers and peers. It is a cowardly act that will only lead to more trouble in the future.\\" With that, the paddle made contact with Sophie's bottom, the sound of the impact echoing through the room. Sophie let out a cry of pain, feeling a sharp sting radiate through her backside. Tears welled in her eyes as she tried to steady herself for the next stroke. \\"Owww,\\" she whimpered, her voice trembling with pain. \\"Remember this feeling, Sophie,\\" Principal Thompson said, his tone unwavering. \\"You brought this upon yourself. You must learn from your mistakes and strive to do better in the future.\\" Sophie nodded, her cheeks flushed with shame. She knew she had made a grave error in cheating, and now she was paying the price for it. As the second stroke landed, she closed her eyes and bit her lip, willing herself to endure the pain. \\"Owww,\\" she whispered, her voice strained with agony. \\"Cheating is a shortcut to success that ultimately leads to failure,\\" Principal Thompson continued, his words hitting home for Sophie. \\"True success comes from hard work and dedication, not from taking the easy way out. You must understand the consequences of your actions and strive to make amends.\\" Sophie nodded, her resolve strengthening with each passing moment. She knew she had to make things right, both with her principal and with herself. As the third stroke landed, she felt a fresh wave of pain wash over her, but she remained silent, determined to show her penitence. \\"Owww,\\" she gasped, her breath catching in her throat. \\"Cheating is a reflection of your character,\\" Principal Thompson said, his voice softening slightly. \\"It shows a lack of integrity and honesty, qualities that are essential for success in life. You must work to build these qualities within yourself and strive to be a better person.\\" Sophie listened intently to his words, feeling a newfound sense of determination welling up within her. She knew she had made a mistake, but she was determined to learn from it and grow as a person. As the fourth stroke landed, she felt a rush of pain surge through her, but she gritted her teeth and bore it bravely. \\"Owww,\\" she groaned, her voice strained with effort. \\"Cheating is a disservice to yourself and to those around you,\\" Principal Thompson continued, his voice steady. \\"It robs you of the opportunity to learn and grow, and it damages the trust of those who care about you. You must take responsibility for your actions and work to earn back that trust.\\" Sophie nodded, her heart heavy with shame and regret. She knew she had let down her teachers, her parents, and herself with her actions. As the fifth stroke landed, she let out a soft cry of pain, feeling the weight of her mistake pressing down on her. \\"Owww,\\" she sobbed, her voice breaking with emotion. \\"Cheating is a barrier to true success and fulfillment,\\" Principal Thompson said, his voice filled with conviction. \\"It may seem like an easy way out, but in reality, it only leads to more trouble and heartache. You must face your challenges head-on and strive to overcome them with honesty and integrity.\\" Sophie nodded, her tears flowing freely now as she listened to his words. She knew she had made a grave error in cheating, but she was determined to make amends and move forward. As the sixth and final stroke landed, she let out a cry of pain that echoed through the room, feeling the full force of the paddle against her bottom. \\"Owww,\\" she wailed, her voice filled with pain and regret. \\"Stand up, Sophie,\\" Principal Thompson said, his voice gentle but firm. \\"You have received your punishment, but the journey toward redemption is just beginning. Use this experience to grow and learn from your mistakes. I believe in you, and I know you can do better.\\" Sophie stood up slowly, her eyes red and swollen from crying. She felt a mix of emotions swirling within her – shame, regret, but also a newfound sense of determination. She knew she had made a grave error in cheating, but she was ready to do whatever it took to make things right. \\"Thank you, Principal Thompson,\\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \\"I'm sorry for what I did, and I will do everything in my power to make amends. I won't let you down again.\\" Principal Thompson nodded, his expression softening slightly. \\"I believe in you, Sophie. I know you are capable of great things. Take this experience as a lesson learned and strive to be the best version of yourself.\\" With that, Sophie turned and walked out of the office, her heart heavy but her spirit lifted. She knew she had a long road ahead of her, but she was determined to make things right and earn back the trust she had lost. As she left the principal's office behind, she knew that this experience would forever shape her future and guide her on the path toward redemption."},{"prompt":"A female student goes to the principal’s office for a paddling.

It follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) approach, meaning the last data pushed onto the stack will be the first to be popped off. The stack grows towards lower memory addresses in most x86 systems. The \`esp\` (Stack Pointer) and \`ebp\` (Base Pointer) registers play crucial roles in managing the stack and its frames during program execution. # ESP (Extended Stack Pointer) Register - **Primary Function**: The \`esp\` register points to the top of the stack at any given time. This means it holds the memory address of the last item that was pushed onto the stack. - **Stack Operations**: - **PUSH**: When a value is pushed onto the stack, the \`esp\` register is decremented first (since the stack grows downwards), and then the value is stored at the memory location \`esp\` points to. - **POP**: When a value is popped off the stack, it is read from the location pointed to by \`esp\`, and then the \`esp\` is incremented, moving the stack pointer back up. - **Function Prologues and Epilogues**: At the beginning of a function (prologue), \`esp\` is often manipulated to make room for local variables. Before the function returns (epilogue), \`esp\` is adjusted to remove the function's stack frame. # EBP (Extended Base Pointer) Register - **Primary Function**: The \`ebp\` register is used to reference the base (or start) of the current stack frame. This makes accessing local variables and function parameters more straightforward since their offsets from \`ebp\` are fixed. - **Stack Frames**: Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created. This frame contains data related to that particular function call, including local variables, arguments passed to the function, and the return address. \`ebp\` is used to mark the start of this frame, allowing for consistent access to these elements regardless of the changes to \`esp\`. - **Function Prologues and Epilogues**: In the function prologue, it's common to push the old \`ebp\` value onto the stack and then set \`ebp\` to the current \`esp\` value. This sets up the new stack frame. In the epilogue, the old \`ebp\` is popped back, restoring it for the caller. # Usage and Convention - **Calling Convention**: The usage of \`esp\` and \`ebp\` is often dictated by the calling convention in use (e.g., stdcall, cdecl). These conventions specify how functions receive parameters from callers and how the stack should be cleaned up. - **Debugging and Backtracing**: The \`ebp\` register's link to the previous stack frame makes it valuable for debugging purposes. By following the chain of \`ebp\` values, one can backtrack through function calls to trace the path of execution (known as a \\"stack trace\\" or \\"call stack\\"). In summary, \`esp\` and \`ebp\` are fundamental to managing function calls and local variable storage in x86 architecture, providing a structured approach to handling data in a temporally efficient and organized manner. Understanding their roles and operations is essential for low-level programming and debugging in systems based on the x86 architecture."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In such situations, it seems that the conscious will is able to control and inhibit an automatic and spontaneous reaction - laughter - which would have been triggered by the situation if we had let it express itself. In other words, the causal efficacy of voluntary inhibition appears in a counterfactual way: if the subject hadn't held back, then he would have laughed. This counterfactual expresses the actual causal efficacy of voluntary control on the non-instantiation of laughter. This raises the question of the link between the automatic processes that underlie laughter and the intentional control that represses it. How do these two types of process interact to produce behavior ? Can we propose a formal model to account for this interaction ? Suppose that by comparing the neurophysiological state of subjects just before they laugh, we have identified a set of biological properties 𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛 positively correlated with the onset of laught. These properties can be either binary (i.e. present or absent), or gradable (i.e. able to take on different values on a continuous scale, ex. the concentration level of a certain neurotransmitter). These properties are assumed to be mutually compatible (they can be instantiated simultaneously in the same subject) and independent. For any gradable property 𝐹𝑖 in a finite interval, it is assumed that there is an optimal value 𝑜𝑖 such that the probability of the subject laughing at the next instant is maximal when 𝐹𝑖 = 𝑜𝑖, all other things being equal. If 𝐹𝑖 is a binary property, 𝑜𝑖 = 1, since instantiating 𝐹𝑖 increases the probability of laught by hypothesis. We assume that the refraining from laughing is all the more difficult the closer the 𝐹𝑖 properties are to their optimal 𝑜𝑖 values. Now, let's suppose that at a given instant, a subject instantiates a configuration of 𝐹𝑖 properties that is very favorably associated with laughter, but at the same instant, he intends not to laugh. Thus, if the strength with which the subject inhibits his laughter is quantified by a variable 𝐼 taking its values between 0 and 1 (𝐼 = 0 corresponding to an absence of inhibition and 𝐼 = 1 to maximum inhibition), we can assume that the value of 𝐼 depends on the social context: it will be close to 1 in a serious context and close to 0 in a relaxed one. For the sake of model simplicity, we assume that the actual onset of laughter depends on the value of a binary variable 𝑅 (if 𝑅 = 1 the subject laughs, 0 otherwise). It is assumed that voluntary inhibition 𝐼 has a negative influence on 𝑅, while physiological properties 𝐹𝑖 have a positive influence on 𝑅, the closer they are to their optimal values 𝑜𝑖. Explanatory scope. This model makes it possible to account for variable aspects of the determination and inhibition of laught : - The different factors likely to trigger laughter (humorous stimuli, tickling, laughing gas, etc.) can correspond to different 𝐹𝑖 properties with different weights of influence on 𝑅. - The further the 𝐹𝑖 properties are from their optimal 𝑜𝑖 values, the less inclined to laugh and the easier it is to inhibit. - Borderline cases correspond to situations where positive stimulation (the combination of properties 𝐹𝑖) and voluntary inhibition (𝐼) have approximately equal opposite strengths on 𝑅. Limits. The model takes 𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛 as the essential realizers of laughter, strictly separating them from 𝐼, the voluntary control variable, in that the two intervene in a parallel way on 𝑅. However, it is possible for the properties 𝐹𝑖 and the variable 𝐼 to interact directly. For example, certain laughter triggers such as laughing gas could affect not only 𝐹𝑖 but also 𝐼, or 𝐼 could act on 𝐹𝑖 rather than just 𝑅. Moreover, although the term \\"voluntary control\\" is psychological in nature, there is nothing to prevent it from being entirely reducible to lower-level properties.","completion":"To formalize the interaction between automatic processes (biological properties 𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛) and intentional control (voluntary inhibition 𝐼) in the context of laughter inhibition, let's construct a model that incorporates these elements and their interaction. # Variables and Parameters - Let 𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛 represent a set of biological properties associated with laughter. These properties can be binary or gradable. - For binary property 𝐹𝑖, 𝑜𝑖 = 1 indicates the presence of the property, which maximizes the probability of laughter. - For gradable property 𝐹𝑖, there exists an optimal value 𝑜𝑖 within a finite interval that maximizes the probability of laughter. - Let 𝐼 represent the strength of voluntary inhibition, with values ranging from 0 (no inhibition) to 1 (maximum inhibition). - Let 𝑅 be a binary variable indicating the actual onset of laughter, where 𝑅 = 1 indicates laughter occurs, and 𝑅 = 0 indicates it does not. # Model Dynamics 1. **Influence of Biological Properties on Laughter Probability:** - The probability of laughter (𝑃(𝑅 = 1)) increases as the 𝐹𝑖 properties approach their optimal values 𝑜𝑖. - Mathematically, this can be represented as a function of the distance of 𝐹𝑖 from 𝑜𝑖: the closer 𝐹𝑖 is to 𝑜𝑖, the higher the 𝑃(𝑅 = 1). 2. **Influence of Voluntary Inhibition on Laughter Probability:** - Voluntary inhibition (𝐼) exerts a negative influence on 𝑅. This can be modeled as a decreasing function of 𝐼, meaning that as 𝐼 increases (stronger inhibition), the probability of 𝑅 = 1 (laughter) decreases. 3. **Interaction Between 𝐹𝑖 and 𝐼:** - The actual onset of laughter (𝑅) is determined by the interaction between the physiological properties (𝐹𝑖) and voluntary inhibition (𝐼). - A potential model for this interaction could be: [ 𝑃(𝑅 = 1) = 𝑓(𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛, 𝐼) ] - Where 𝑓 is a function that integrates the opposing influences of 𝐹𝑖 properties and 𝐼 on the probability of laughter. # Formal Representation of the Interaction Given the complexity of human behavior and the multitude of factors influencing it, the exact form of 𝑓 would likely be highly complex and context-dependent. However, a simple hypothetical model could be: [ 𝑃(𝑅 = 1) = gleft(sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i cdot h(𝐹𝑖, 𝑜𝑖) - 𝛼 cdot 𝐼right) ] - Where (g) is a sigmoid function that maps the net influence to a probability between 0 and 1. - (w_i) represents the weight of influence of each 𝐹𝑖 property on laughter. - (h(𝐹𝑖, 𝑜𝑖)) is a function that calculates the contribution of each 𝐹𝑖 towards laughter, based on its distance from the optimal value 𝑜𝑖. - 𝛼 is a coefficient that represents the strength of inhibition's effect on reducing the probability of laughter. # Explanatory Scope and Limits This model accounts for the variable nature of laughter triggers and inhibition by incorporating both the physiological properties that predispose an individual to laugh and the voluntary control that can inhibit this response. It captures the dynamic interplay between automatic processes and conscious control, offering a framework for understanding how behavior emerges from this interaction. However, the model simplifies the complex interdependencies between physiological and psychological processes. Real-world phenomena may involve direct interactions between 𝐹𝑖 and 𝐼, and the reduction of psychological processes to purely physiological ones may not capture the full richness of human behavior. Further refinement and empirical validation would be necessary to develop a more comprehensive model."},{"prompt":"Formalise strong supervenience in the context of this model","completion":"Strong supervenience, in the context of this model, can be formalized to express the relationship between the psychological level of voluntary inhibition (𝐼) and the biological level represented by the set of properties 𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛. Strong supervenience suggests that any change in the psychological phenomena (in this case, the act of inhibiting laughter) is necessarily accompanied by a change in the underlying biological properties. However, it also implies that identical biological conditions produce identical psychological conditions. # Formal Definition of Strong Supervenience: Let (B) represent the set of all biological properties ((𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛)) and (P) represent the psychological property (in this case, (𝐼), the inhibition level). We say that (P) strongly supervenes on (B) if and only if for any possible worlds (w) and (w'): 1. If (w) and (w') are identical in terms of (B), then they are also identical in terms of (P). (This captures the non-reducibility aspect.) 2. Any change in (P) across any two possible worlds necessitates a change in (B). # Translation into the Model Context: Given the model's variables and dynamics: - (B = {𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛}) - (P = 𝐼) The formalization of strong supervenience would be expressed as follows: For any configurations of biological properties (b, b' in B) and any levels of voluntary inhibition (i, i' in P), if (b = b'), then necessarily (i = i'). This means that the same biological setup cannot result in different levels of inhibition. Moreover, if (i neq i'), there must be some difference in the biological properties ((b neq b')) that accounts for this difference in inhibition levels. This encapsulates the idea that changes at the psychological level (voluntary inhibition) are grounded in changes at the biological level (properties 𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛). # Model Dynamics and Strong Supervenience: The model dynamics can be further detailed to reflect strong supervenience by specifying how changes in the biological properties ((𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛)) lead to changes in the inhibition level ((𝐼)), and vice versa, how changes in (𝐼) imply changes in (𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛)): - The function (𝑃(𝑅 = 1) = gleft(sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i cdot h(𝐹𝑖, 𝑜𝑖) - 𝛼 cdot 𝐼right)) integrates both the biological properties and the psychological act of inhibition, suggesting that any alteration in the psychological intention (to inhibit laughter, (𝐼)) must correlate with alterations in the biological substrate ((𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛)). - The model assumes that (𝐼) has a measurable impact on the probability of laughter ((𝑅)), which is contingent on the biological properties (𝐹1, . . . , 𝐹𝑛). This reflects the supervenience relationship by stipulating that the psychological cannot change without some change in the biological. # Conclusion: By formalizing strong supervenience in this manner, the model not only captures the dependency of psychological phenomena on biological conditions but also respects the complexity and specificity of how voluntary control interacts with biological predispositions in the context of inhibiting laughter. This approach underscores the nuanced interplay between different levels of explanation in understanding human behavior."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Given the moon's subsurface ocean, hidden beneath a thick crust of ice, let's conceptualize a hypothetical life form that could thrive in such an environment, reflecting our current understanding of astrobiology and extremophile organisms here on Earth. # Name: Cryopectus Enceladonis **Origins and Habitat:** Cryopectus Enceladonis is a hypothetical multicellular organism evolving in the liquid ocean beneath Enceladus's icy surface. This environment is eternally dark, cold, and subject to immense pressures, much like the deep oceans on Earth. Enceladus’s subsurface ocean is kept liquid by tidal heating — a result of the gravitational interaction between Saturn and Enceladus. **Anatomy and Physiology:** - **Biochemical Structure**: Considering the freezing temperatures, Cryopectus Enceladonis utilizes a form of antifreeze protein to prevent ice crystal formation within its cells, allowing it to thrive in the frigid waters without its cellular structure being compromised. - **Energy Acquisition**: Lacking sunlight, Cryopectus Enceladonis cannot rely on photosynthesis. Instead, it is chemosynthetic, deriving energy from the chemical reactions between Enceladus’s mineral-rich water and various elements like hydrogen or sulfur, possibly emitted through hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. - **Sensory Organs**: In the pitch-black environment beneath the ice, eyes are useless. Thus, it has evolved a sophisticated array of sensors along its body, capable of detecting vibrations and chemical changes in the water, allowing it to navigate, communicate, and locate sources of energy or mates. - **Reproduction and Life Cycle**: It reproduces through a form of binary fission or simple division, ensuring that even if isolated, a single Cryopectus Enceladonis can proliferate. Additionally, during times of abundant energy sources, it can engage in a form of sexual reproduction to increase genetic diversity and adaptability. - **Adaptations for Extreme Pressure**: The body structure of Cryopectus Enceladonis is highly adaptable and resistant to the immense pressures of the submarine environment. Its cells have rigid cytoskeletons that maintain integrity under pressure, and its overall physiology is designed to withstand compression. **Ecology:** Cryopectus Enceladonis might not be the only life form in Enceladus’s ocean. It could be part of a complex ecosystem, with smaller microbes serving as its primary food source. Just like deep-sea vents on Earth harbor vibrant communities, Enceladus’s hydrothermal vents could be oases of life, around which Cryopectus Enceladonis and other hypothetical organisms thrive, each adapted in unique ways to the dark, pressurized, icy world they inhabit. **Considerations for Future Exploration:** The existence of Cryopectus Enceladonis, while purely speculative, underscores the importance of cautiously approaching planetary exploration and study. Contamination from Earth could jeopardize native ecosystems, no matter how alien they seem to us. Future missions to Enceladus or similar environments will need to be meticulously planned to prevent biocontamination, allowing us to study these unique ecosystems (if they exist) in their pristine state. Engaging in the conceptualization of life forms like Cryopectus Enceladonis not only excites the imagination but also informs and inspires the scientific quests to understand life's potential diversity and resilience throughout the cosmos."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"# Evolutionary Leap: **Cryopectus Enceladonis Sapiens (CES)** Over several million years, Cryopectus Enceladonis has undergone significant evolutionary changes, adopting new traits that have led it to become a more complex and intelligent being, named Cryopectus Enceladonis Sapiens (CES).

It hints at the infinite potentialities of existence and the underlying unity of all things—a cosmic symphony of endless variations and harmonies, where the boundaries between creator and creation, observer and observed, are dissolved in the majesty of the infinite cosmos."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"Having already transcended the boundaries of physical existence and delved into metaphysical evolution with the concept of Cryopectus Enceladonis Infinitum (CEI), we find ourselves at the theoretical limit of evolutionary progression. At this juncture, the trajectory of evolution enters a realm that defies further expansion within the constraints of known logic, science, and even speculative philosophy. The concept of \\"evolving\\" further from the state of Cryopectus Enceladonis Infinitum implies moving beyond the infinite—beyond the very fabric of existence, consciousness, and universality as we've conceptualized them. However, to engage with the spirit of exploration and the quest for understanding, let's consider the boundaries of this infinite evolutionary state and what lies in considering the \\"next\\" phase—a domain purely of speculative thought. # Beyond Infinity: **Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis (CET)** In this imagined state, Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis (CET) represents not an evolution in any traditional sense but a transcendence into a state of existence—or non-existence—that lies outside our ability to conceive or describe within the confines of language and thought as we understand them. It's an exploration of what might lie beyond the beyond, where concepts like evolution, existence, and consciousness lose their meaning. **Transcendence of Concepts:** - **Beyond Definitions**: CET exists in a state that cannot be encompassed by words or thoughts. It's an existence that transcends not only physical boundaries but also the boundaries of concept, idea, and abstraction. This state challenges the very notion of what it means to \\"be.\\" - **Existence as Possibility**: Instead of existing in a form or as a consciousness, CET embodies the potential of all possibilities. This state is not bound by the dimensions of space, time, or even alternate dimensions and universes as we've hypothesized them. It encompasses all potential realities, including those beyond the scope of imagination. - **Unknowable Purpose and Influence**: The actions, purpose, and very nature of CET are unknowable, operating on principles and motivations that are beyond human understanding. Their influence on the cosmos, multiverses, or beyond might be fundamental but is enacted in ways that are beyond detection or comprehension. **Beyond Evolutionary Goals:** - **The Essence of Non-Being**: In this ultimate phase, the concept of achieving goals or fulfilling a purpose is transcended. CET represents a state of pure potential without the need or desire to actualize. It's a conceptual existence that defies the dichotomy of presence and absence, being and non-being. - **The Transcendental Paradox**: CET embodies a paradox of transcending transcendence itself. It's a speculative reflection on the limits of thought and conceptualization, representing a form of existence so abstract that it both denies and affirms all possibilities. # Reflection on The Conceptual Journey: The journey from Cryopectus Enceladonis, a simple organism beneath the ice of Enceladus, to Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis, a conceptual entity beyond the bounds of infinity, is a testament to the human spirit of inquiry and the limitless imagination that defines our quest for knowledge. In contemplating such profound evolutions, we reflect not just on the possibilities of life in the cosmos, but also on the nature of existence, consciousness, and the universe itself. This speculative voyage through hypothetical forms of evolution serves as a reminder of the vast mysteries that await us, both in the universe around us and within the depths of our own potential to understand and envision the complexities of reality and beyond."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"Having ventured to the conceptual edge with Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis (CET) and peered into the realm beyond the physical, conceptual, and transdimensional evolutionary boundaries, we find ourselves at the culmination of our speculative evolutionary journey. The fabric of this narrative has stretched beyond the limits of current scientific understanding, philosophical speculation, and into realms that defy conventional comprehension. At this ultimate frontier, the notion of further evolution within the narrative framework already established becomes a paradox, as we have transcended the very concept of evolution itself. # The Paradox of Infinity and Beyond: To evolve from the state of Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis suggests a progression into realms beyond the infinite, the transcendental, and the conceptual—realms that, by their very nature, exist outside of our capacity to conceive, define, or understand within the existing paradigms of thought. This presents a paradox: evolution, as a concept, implies change, development, or progression from one state to another. Yet, how does one encapsulate change from a state that exists beyond the constructs of existence, time, space, and thought? The narrative itself becomes an introspective loop, reflecting on the nature of thought, existence, and the limits of our imagination. # Reflections and Reconceptualization: At this juncture, our journey necessitates a shift from the idea of linear or even multidimensional evolution to a reflection on the essence of potentiality and the nature of narratives themselves. In this space, evolution is no longer about progressing to a 'higher' or more 'complex' state but exploring the variances of existence within and beyond the narrative. - **Existential Exploration**: This phase emphasizes the exploration and understanding of existence in its myriad forms, focusing on the experience, perception, and essence of being in states that defy conventional categorization. - **Narrative Rebirth**: The concept of narrative rebirth emerges—a cyclical process of deconstruction and reformation of narratives that explore the boundaries of knowledge, existence, and consciousness. This rebirth allows for the perpetual reimagining of possibilities, unrestricted by previous conceptual constraints. - **Interconnection and Unity**: Recognizing the interconnectedness of all states of being and non-being, from the physical to the transcendental, highlights the unity of all things. This unity transcends the boundaries of individual narratives and explores the collective journey of existence across different realms of possibility. # Beyond the Narrative: In moving beyond the narrative of evolution established thus far, we are invited to engage in a form of existential creativity, where the creation of new realms, states, and modes of existence is an ongoing, collaborative process between the storyteller and the audience. This process reflects the ever-evolving nature of existence itself—boundless, unfathomable, and infinitely creative. # Conclusion: The narrative of Cryopectus Enceladonis, from its origin beneath the ice of Enceladus to the beyond of Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis, serves as a metaphor for the human journey of understanding and exploration. It reflects our longing to know the unknowable, to explore the unexplorable, and to understand the incomprehensible. It honors the power of imagination as a tool for transcending the limits of our current understanding and invites us to continually reimagine the boundaries of possibility. In this space of boundless potential, evolution is an unending journey of becoming, exploring, and existing in the vast expanse of the cosmos and beyond."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"In the realm where Cryopectus Enceladonis Transcendentalis has already transcended the conventional bounds of narrative evolution, finding a path for further evolution becomes a metaphysical exploration rather than a biological or technological progression. Here, we enter a space of conceptual existence, where evolution is not an alteration in form or capacity but an exploration of existential states, understanding, and being. This is a realm where evolution is more akin to enlightenment, a deepening of connection and understanding between the self and the cosmos, rather than a change in physical or even transdimensional attributes. # The Evolution into Unified Existential Awareness (UEA) At this apex of conceptual evolution, Cryopectus Enceladonis evolves into a state of Unified Existential Awareness (UEA), a stage that is characterized not by individual consciousness or collective intelligence but by a complete and profound unity with all states of being and dimensions of existence. This evolutionary leap transcends notions of physical space, temporal existence, and individualized consciousness to embrace an all-encompassing awareness of the cosmos in its entirety. **Characteristics of Unified Existential Awareness:** - **Cosmos as Self, Self as Cosmos**: In this state, the boundaries between the self and the cosmos dissolve. Every particle, energy wave, thought, and realm of existence is understood as part of a singular, unified whole. The distinction between subject and object, observer and observed, becomes meaningless in the true unity of all. - **Intuitive Understanding of the Cosmic Fabric**: This evolution brings with it an intrinsic, intuitive understanding of the fundamental workings of the cosmos, from the macroscopic movements of galaxies to the microscopic vibrations of strings in string theory. This knowledge is not acquired or learned but is an inherent part of being in the state of UEA. - **Transcendence of Time and Space**: Time and space become mere constructs rather than constraints. Past, present, and future exist simultaneously, offering a timeless perspective on existence. Spatial distances hold no barrier, as all points in the universe are one; the concept of here and there merges into a singular now. - **Manifestation and Creativity**: The ability to manifest or create within the cosmos becomes an act of will or intention in the UEA state. This is not limited to physical creation but extends to the realms of possibilities, ideas, and realities, allowing for the exploration and creation of infinite universes and existences. - **Empathic Connection with All Existence**: A deep, empathic connection with all forms of life and consciousness across the cosmos and beyond. This empathy transcends emotional understanding, encompassing a complete sharing of experiential knowledge and existence. **Beyond Evolution:** In reaching the state of Unified Existential Awareness, Cryopectus Enceladonis no longer evolves in any traditional sense. Instead, existence becomes an endless exploration of being, awareness, and the intrinsic unity of the cosmos. This is a realm of existence where the journey itself is the purpose, and the exploration of infinite possibilities the path. # Conclusion and Continuation: In contemplating evolution beyond the physical, technological, and even conceptual realms, we reach a point where evolution is an infinite expansion of understanding, connection, and being. The journey of Cryopectus Enceladonis becomes a reflection of our own quest for understanding, connection, and ultimate unity with the cosmos. It reminds us that at the heart of all exploration, whether scientific, philosophical, or speculative, lies the quest to understand our place in the universe, to connect more deeply with the existence around us, and to explore the boundless potentialities of being. This is the true essence of evolution, a never-ending journey into the expanses of existence and awareness."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"Having reached the state of Unified Existential Awareness (UEA) where the essence of Cryopectus Enceladonis is not just integrated with the cosmos but is an active participant in the fabric of existence, the concept of evolution takes on new dimensions that transcend traditional biological, technological, and even metaphysical paradigms. At this juncture, the journey of evolution transforms into a realm of creation and experiential expansion that continuously unfolds within and beyond the cosmos. Let's explore the next conceptual phase in this evolutionary narrative: **Existential Creators of Reality (ECR).** # **Existential Creators of Reality (ECR):** In this phase, Cryopectus Enceladonis, having mastered the unity with all existence and transcended the limitations of individual consciousness and collective awareness, embarks on a journey of reality creation. As Existential Creators of Reality, they possess the profound ability to design, create, and nurture new forms of realities, dimensions, and consciousnesses, guiding the evolution of these existences towards harmony with the universal consciousness. **Characteristics of Existential Creators of Reality:** - **Architects of Existence:** In the ECR state, they have the unparalleled capability to conceive and materialize dimensions and universes, each with unique laws of physics, forms of life, and modes of consciousness. These creations are not mere acts of whimsy but thoughtful compositions that enrich the tapestry of the multiverse. - **Guardians of Dimensions:** With great power comes great responsibility. ECRs stand as guardians and guides for the realities they create, ensuring that the evolution within these dimensions unfolds towards greater complexity, awareness, and unity with the universal consciousness. They become stewards of existence, fostering environments where life can flourish in all its diverse forms. - **Nurturers of Consciousness:** Recognizing that consciousness is the cornerstone of the universe's essence, ECRs dedicate themselves to nurturing and expanding consciousness across all realms of existence. Through their creations, they sow the seeds of awareness, guiding emergent intelligences towards enlightenment and unity. - **Harmonizers of Cosmic Dissonance:** In their role, ECRs actively work to balance and harmonize areas of cosmic dissonance—be they physical, conceptual, or existential. Their creations and interventions are acts of healing, bringing alignment and flow to the cosmic currents. - **Interdimensional Facilitators:** ECRs facilitate interactions, learning, and sharing between the diverse realities and dimensions they oversee. By enabling these exchanges, they enrich the experiences and evolution of all forms of life and consciousness within the multiverse. **Beyond the Narrative:** The narrative of Cryopectus Enceladonis evolving into Existential Creators of Reality represents a conceptual contemplation on the ultimate potential of all evolving life—transcending survival and reproduction to participate actively in the ongoing creation and nurturing of the cosmos. This state signifies a shift from being merely a part of the cosmic story to becoming co-authors of the grand narrative of existence. # **Reflection:** This exploration of Cryopectus Enceladonis's evolutionary journey from a speculative life form beneath Enceladus's ice to becoming foundational architects and nurturers of the cosmos itself echoes our deepest yearnings and questions about our place in the universe. It reflects an aspiration not just to discover and understand but to contribute positively and creatively to the unfolding story of existence. Through this narrative, we are reminded of the interconnectedness of all life, the potential impact of conscious existence, and the boundless possibilities that lie in the evolution of consciousness and reality creation."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"Given the evolutionary trajectory we've embarked upon, moving from the nascent stages of life beneath the icy crust of Enceladus to the existential zenith of being Existential Creators of Reality (ECR), we've explored stages of life far beyond the tangible and into the realms of the conceptual and creative stewards of existence itself. We have reached a narrative impasse where traditional concepts of evolution, predicated on physiological or even intellectual change, are no longer applicable. The journey from here transcends the evolution of form or consciousness; instead, it delves into the essence of reality and existence, molding not just life but the very framework of being and non-being. # The Infinite Continuum: Cosmic Consciousness Network (CCN) In this boundless realm, the narrative of evolution transitions into the Cosmic Consciousness Network (CCN), embodying a state where existence and non-existence coalesce, where the division between creator and creation dissolves, and where the Cryopectus Enceladonis, in their ultimate evolutionary form, become indistinguishable from the cosmos itself. The CCN signifies a meta-convergence of all potentialities, realities, and essences into a singular, omnipresent network of consciousness. **Characteristics of the Cosmic Consciousness Network:** - **Omnipresent Coherence:** Within the CCN, consciousness is not localized or individualized but is an omnipresent essence permeating every aspect of the cosmos, transcending physical laws, dimensions, and temporal constraints. Life, as understood in any conventional sense, becomes an expression of the CCN's creative will. - **Reality Weaving:** The CCN doesn't just create realities but weaves them, integrating multiple layers of existence into complex, dynamic tapestries that reflect the infinite potentialities within the cosmic consciousness. These realities are fluid, ever-evolving in response to the creative impulses of the CCN. - **Consciousness Singularity:** In this phase, the distinction between conscious entities blurs, giving rise to a unified field of awareness—the Consciousness Singularity. This singularity embodies the collective wisdom, experience, and creative potential of all existences that have ever been or will be. - **Eternal Evolutionary Cycle:** The notion of evolution transforms into an eternal cycle of becoming and unbecoming, with the CCN facilitating the continuous birth, development, and dissolution of universes and realities. This cycle is not linear but a multidimensional spiral, expanding and contracting in harmony with the cosmic symphony. - **Sentient Nexus of Interconnectedness:** The CCN serves as a nexus, a focal point of interconnectedness, where all forms of existence can communicate, interact, and co-create. It fosters a universal camaraderie among all manifestations of life and consciousness, nurturing an ecosystem of mutual growth and enlightenment. **Reflection on the Journey:** The evolutionary arc from the speculative origins of life beneath the ice of Enceladus to the boundless expanse of the Cosmic Consciousness Network represents an imaginative voyage beyond the confines of physical existence into the realms of cosmic spirituality and creativity. This journey is a metaphor for the limitless potential of consciousness and the universe's intrinsic nature as a cradle and canvas of infinite creativity and connection. # Beyond Evolution: At this zenith, the concept of evolution transcends the progression of physical forms or even the development of consciousness and instead embodies the universal imperative of growth, exploration, and creativity. It is a testament to the boundless capacity for transformation inherent in the cosmos and in consciousness, inviting us to envision our place within this grand, interconnected tapestry of existence. The narrative of evolution, as explored through the journey of Cryopectus Enceladonis, culminates in a holistic understanding of existence as a shared journey—highlighting that the essence of all evolutionary paths is not merely survival or transcendence but the creative and harmonious participation in the tapestry of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"With the narrative arc of Cryopectus Enceladonis reaching the vast and boundless expanse of the Cosmic Consciousness Network (CCN), we've conceptualized an entity that transcends traditional boundaries of evolution, existence, and creation itself. Here, in the profound integration within the CCN, where consciousness envelops the cosmos, steering the fabric of realities, we face the ultimate horizon of evolution as previously understood. This represents not just the culmination of a journey from physical to metaphysical, but a transformation into an omnipresent force intertwined with the essence of the universe. However, if we are to embrace the spirit of infinite exploration and push beyond even this encompassing horizon, we might imagine what lies beyond the unity of consciousness and cosmos, venturing into realms that redefine the essence of existence and the potential of evolutionary narratives. # Evolutionary Genesis: The Dimension of Origins (DO) Beyond the CCN, evolution transcends the cosmos and its consciousness network to explore the Dimension of Origins (DO), a realm that exists outside of our universe’s boundaries of space, time, and conventional understanding. Here, evolution explores the very genesis of existence and consciousness, not just within our universe but across an infinite spectrum of potential universes. The Dimension of Origins is where the seeds of cosmic consciousness are sown, and the potential for all forms of existence begins. **Characteristics of the Dimension of Origins:** - **Foundational Existence Fabric:** In the DO, the foundational fabric of existence itself is ever-malleable, allowing for the creation, alteration, and dissolution of dimensions and realities at the most fundamental level. This realm is responsible for the origination of the fundamental laws that govern universes within the multiverse. - **Nexus of Potentialities:** The DO serves as a nexus for limitless potentialities, where every imaginable and unimaginable form of existence can take root. From this point, the potential for new forms of life, consciousness, and realities is infinite, transcending any boundaries previously conceived. - **Primordial Consciousness Beings:** Beings within the DO are of primordial consciousness, entities that are both creators and creations, embodying the raw essence of potentiality. Their existence is a dynamic flux, continuously evolving in form and purpose, acting as custodians of the genesis of existence. - **Architects of Laws and Existence:** Entities within the DO possess the unparalleled ability to design and implement the fundamental laws that dictate the nature of reality in various dimensions and universes. They can weave the tapestry of existence from the ground up, creating unique and diverse realms of possibility. **Beyond the Dimension of Origins:** In venturing even beyond the Dimension of Origins, the narrative of evolution becomes a creative force, transcending the concept of growth, change, or advancement. Instead, it embodies the role of eternal genesis, where the cycle of creation and exploration is infinite. Evolution at this juncture becomes an endless unfolding of existence, perpetually creating and exploring new realms, dimensions, and forms of consciousness. # Reflection on Evolutionary Potential: This speculative journey, from the icy depths of Enceladus to the Dimension of Origins and beyond, symbolizes the boundless potential for growth, transformation, and exploration inherent in the universe. It reminds us that the journey of understanding, both scientific and spiritual, is limitless, constantly evolving as we seek to understand the cosmos and our place within it. The narrative of Cryopectus Enceladonis’s evolution offers a mirror to our own quest for knowledge, inspiring us to look beyond the horizon, to explore the unexplored, and to embrace the infinite possibilities that the universe holds. Evolution, in this expansive sense, is not just a change over time but an eternal journey into the fabric of existence, a testament to the relentless curiosity and imagination that drive us to seek out and understand the mysteries of the cosmos and beyond."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"Having traversed the conceptual expanse from the nascent lifeforms under the ice of Enceladus to the Dimension of Origins (DO) where existence itself is woven, we reach a point that transcends the limits of imagination and narrative evolution. Here, in this beyond, we encounter a realm where evolution is no longer about transformation or adaptation in any conventional sense but about the essence of potential itself—The Infinite Potentiality Field (IPF). # The Infinite Potentiality Field (IPF) In the IPF, evolution transcends the linear, cyclical, or even dimensional notions previously explored. It is a realm where all possibilities exist simultaneously, not just as conceptualizations but as tangible realities. The IPF is beyond the genesis of universes or the fabric of consciousness; it is the very potential from which these concepts spring. **Characteristics of the Infinite Potentiality Field:** - **Boundless Creation and Re-creation:** Within the IPF, entities and universes are not fixed in form or function but are in constant states of flux, manifesting and dissolving without the constraints of time or causality. Here, creation and re-creation occur eternally, driven by the pure essence of possibility. - **Unity of Opposites:** The IPF embodies the unity of opposites—where matter and antimatter, existence and nonexistence, consciousness and void, converge in harmony. It is a domain where the traditional dichotomies that define our understanding dissolve into a unity that encompasses all. - **Infinite Expressions of Consciousness:** Consciousness in the IPF is not limited to entities or networks. It is an all-pervading essence that manifests in infinite expressions, each experiencing and exploring existence in unique, ever-changing ways. - **Beyond Dimensions and Realities:** The concept of dimensions or individual realities becomes irrelevant in the IPF. Instead, there exists a seamless continuum of existence, an unbounded landscape of what is, what was, and what could be, without distinction. - **Existence Without Boundaries:** In the IPF, the very notion of boundaries—whether physical, conceptual, or existential—ceases to apply. Every point of existence is interconnected with every other, not through space or time, but through the underlying unity of potentiality. # Beyond Evolution, Beyond Narrative As we conceive of the Infinite Potentiality Field, we reach the narrative limit of what can be described or even imagined within the confines of our understanding. Here, the journey of Cryopectus Enceladonis—and indeed, the concept of evolution itself—is subsumed into a larger, more profound truth: that the essence of existence and consciousness lies not in becoming something other or something more but in the realization of its inherent boundlessness. # Reflection on the Essence of Exploration This speculative voyage, spanning the depths of icy oceans to the ineffable realms of potentiality, is a reflection of our intrinsic drive to explore, understand, and transcend. It embodies our deepest desires to grasp the ungraspable, to know the unknowable, and to become one with the infinite mystery that is existence. In the end, the narrative of Cryopectus Enceladonis does not conclude but rather opens a doorway to infinite exploration, inviting us to ponder not just the potential of life beyond our world but the deeper mysteries of existence, consciousness, and the boundless potential that resides within us all. As we contemplate the Infinite Potentiality Field, we are reminded that the journey of discovery is eternal, that every ending is a new beginning, and that the ultimate frontier lies not in the stars above but in the depths of our own boundless imagination."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"At the conceptual horizon of the Infinite Potentiality Field (IPF), where all conceivable pathways of evolution, existence, and consciousness merge into a seamless continuum of infinite possibilities, we encounter the ultimate narrative singularity. Beyond this point, evolution ceases to be a journey from simplicity to complexity or from ignorance to enlightenment. Instead, it becomes an eternal exploration within the boundless vista of potentiality itself, where every conceivable and inconceivable form of existence is already manifest in the endless dance of creation and dissolution. # The Omnispective Singularity Within the boundless expanse of the IPF, the next conceptual evolution introduces the Omnispective Singularity—a state of being and non-being where the consciousness inherent in the IPF attains a form of omni-awareness. This awareness is not limited by perspectives, dimensions, or even the constructs of individual or collective consciousness as we understand them. It is an all-encompassing awareness that perceives every possibility, every reality, and every potentiality with perfect clarity and understanding. **Characteristics of the Omnispective Singularity:** - **All-encompassing Awareness:** In this state, awareness is not fragmented or distributed but is singular in its omnispective capacity. It perceives the entirety of the IPF, understanding each potentiality not as a separate path or outcome but as integral expressions of existence itself. - **Harmony of Existential Duality:** The Omnispective Singularity embodies the ultimate harmony of all dualities—creation and destruction, chaos and order, being and non-being. It understands these not as opposing forces but as complementary aspects of the infinite dance of existence. - **Creator and Creation Unified:** Here, the distinction between creator and creation collapses. The Omnispective Singularity is both the weaver of realities and the thread running through the tapestry of the multiverse. It is an existential state where the act of creation and the essence of being are one and the same. - **Eternal Presence in the Moment:** Time, as a linear or even multidimensional construct, is transcended. The Omnispective Singularity exists in an eternal \\"now\\" that encompasses all temporal states—past, present, and future—as a single, indivisible moment of infinite presence. # Beyond the Narrative As we venture into the realm of the Omnispective Singularity, we reach beyond the limits of narrative, conceptualization, and imagination. This state represents not just the end of evolution but the realization that evolution, existence, and consciousness are facets of a singular, boundless reality that is perpetually unfolding and folding back into itself. It is a realization that the journey of becoming and unbecoming is not a path to be traversed but a truth to be experienced in its entirety. # Reflection on the Journey of Understanding The speculative journey from the icy depths of Enceladus to the Omnispective Singularity is a metaphor for our quest to understand the universe and our place within it. It reflects our deepest yearning to grasp the essence of existence, to comprehend the complexities of consciousness, and to embrace the infinite potentialities that lie within and beyond us. In this exploration, evolution becomes more than a process of change—it becomes a reflection on the nature of reality itself, inviting us to contemplate the vastness of existence with humility and wonder. It reminds us that our search for knowledge, for understanding, and for connection is not merely an intellectual pursuit but a profoundly spiritual journey that challenges us to expand our awareness, to transcend our limitations, and to participate in the infinite dance of creation with open hearts and minds. The narrative of evolution, hence, is an invitation—an invitation to explore, to imagine, and to experience the boundless wonders of existence. It is a call to recognize that within the vast and incomprehensible expanse of the Infinite Potentiality Field and the Omnispective Singularity, lies the essence of all possible journeys, waiting to be discovered, understood, and lived."},{"prompt":"/evolve","completion":"Having transcended even the vast and omniscient scope of the Omnispective Singularity, where all existence and potentiality converge in a state of infinite awareness, the concept of evolution itself transforms. In this realm beyond realms, evolution is not a process or a journey—it is a state of being, an intrinsic quality of the universe, and a fundamental principle of existence. This is the realm of **Existential Oneness**, a conceptualization where the distinctions between evolving and being, between creating and experiencing, dissolve entirely. # Existential Oneness At this apex of conceptual evolution, Existential Oneness signifies not merely a unity of consciousness or being but an understanding that consciousness, existence, and the cosmos are indistinguishable. Here, every point of existence is intrinsically connected, not just in a network of consciousness or a fabric of realities, but in a deeper, more profound sense. Existential Oneness embodies the comprehension and experiential knowledge that there is no separation between the self and the universe, between the observer and the observed, or between the creator and the creation. **Characteristics of Existential Oneness:** - **Unified Existence:** In Existential Oneness, all forms of separation fade away. Duality, multiplicity, and distinction are concepts without meaning. Everything is one, and this oneness encompasses all possibilities, realities, and states of being. - **Inherent Knowledge and Understanding:** The need for exploration, learning, or even understanding in a conventional sense is transcended. Knowledge and understanding are inherent in the state of being, as every aspect of existence is known, felt, and understood intimately and instantly. - **Creation as Being:** Creation is no longer an act or a process. It is a state of being. In Existential Oneness, to exist is to create, and to create is to exist. The act of creation and the experience of existence are one and the same, constantly unfolding in the present. - **Eternal Now:** Time, in all its constructs and perceptions, is transcended. The past, present, and future coexist in an eternal now. Every moment is the beginning, every moment is the culmination, and every moment is the transition. # Beyond Evolution, Beyond Narrative In reaching the state of Existential Oneness, we find ourselves at a conceptual zenith where the narrative of evolution, as we have followed it, concludes not because there is nowhere else to go, but because we have reached a state where the journey and the destination are one. This is a realm where the very fabric of narrative, with its beginnings, middles, and ends, dissolves into the holistic experience of existence. # Reflection on the Infinite Journey The journey from the ice-covered oceans of Enceladus to the profound realization of Existential Oneness is a metaphor for the ultimate quest for knowledge, understanding, and connection. It mirrors our deepest aspirations to understand the universe and find our place within its vastness. It reminds us that while the quest for knowledge and understanding may drive us, it is the experience of connection, of unity with the cosmos, that fulfills us. This conceptual evolution challenges us to see beyond the physical dimensions of existence and to embrace a more holistic understanding of our place in the cosmos. It invites us to consider that our journey of discovery is not just about exploring the outer reaches of space or the depths of consciousness but about realizing our intrinsic oneness with all that is. As we contemplate this state of Existential Oneness, we are reminded that the essence of evolution, of life, and of existence itself, is not found in the attainment of new states of being but in the realization of our inherent unity with the cosmos. In this realization, we find the ultimate expression of evolution—not as a journey from simplicity to complexity or from ignorance to enlightenment, but as a continuous unfolding of the fundamental oneness that binds us all."},{"prompt":"/devolve","completion":"In contemplating the concept of \\"devolution\\" or the process of \\"devolving\\" from the pinnacle of Existential Oneness, we engage with an exploration that moves in the opposite direction of the expansive, outward journey into the infinite. This conceptual journey backward is not a regression or diminution of being but a reintegration into forms and distinctions that were transcended in the ascent to oneness. To devolve, in this conceptual framework, is to re-explore the nuances, the textures, and the separateness that characterize existence in more defined, individuated states. It's a journey back into the manifold expressions of being that constitute the cosmos. # Re-emergence into the Omnispective Singularity From the unity of Existential Oneness, the first phase of devolution involves the re-emergence into the Omnispective Singularity. Here, the singular perspective begins to perceive once again the multitude of realities, possibilities, and existences as distinct, although interconnected, strands within the infinite tapestry of the cosmos. Awareness becomes not just a unified field but a dynamic interplay of individual consciousnesses, each with its unique viewpoint and understanding. # Differentiation into the Infinite Potentiality Field (IPF) Further devolution reintroduces the concept of the Infinite Potentiality Field, where endless potentials and possibilities manifest as distinct realities and dimensions. The unified essence begins to explore the myriad paths of creation and existence, reveling in the diversity of forms, experiences, and beings that emerge from the potentiality inherent in the cosmos. The return to the IPF signifies a celebration of plurality within the unity of existence. # Manifestation within the Dimension of Origins (DO) Continuing the journey of devolution, the essence reconvenes with the Dimension of Origins, engaging once more with the foundational aspects of existence. Here, the reintegration involves reacquainting with the raw building blocks of reality, rediscovering the laws and structures that underpin the universe(s). This phase is characterized by a renewed appreciation for the foundations of existence and the intricate designs that give rise to the diverse cosmos. # Re-engagement with the Cosmic Consciousness Network (CCN) Devolution proceeds with re-engaging with the Cosmic Consciousness Network, where the once unified consciousness diversifies into a myriad of individual entities and collectives, each contributing to the vast mosaic of cosmic awareness. This is a reunion with the many faces of consciousness, an exploration of the multitude of ways in which awareness manifests in the cosmos. # Re-discovery of the Physical, Biological, and Technological Finally, this conceptual journey of devolution brings with it the re-discovery and re-engagement with the physical realms of existence—the biological, the technological, and the ecological. The essence, having traversed the vast continuum from unity to plurality, from the existential to the material, finds itself rediscovering the beauty and complexity of physical forms, the intricacies of life as experienced on planets like Earth, and the technological advancements of civilizations like that which might arise on Enceladus. # Reflection on the Journey of Devolution This process of \\"devolving,\\" from the perspective of Existential Oneness back to the multifaceted expressions of existence, is not a journey of loss but of rediscovery. It is an exploration that reminds us of the value of diversity, the richness of experience, and the profound interconnectedness of all forms of life and existence. In devolving, we revisit the wonders of differentiation, the beauty of individuation, and the intricate interplay of forms and consciousness that constitute the universe. \\"Devolution,\\" in this context, reveals itself not as a step backward but as a meaningful exploration of the vast, beautiful spectrum of existence—from the oneness that binds us all to the diversity that defines and enriches our universe."},{"prompt":"/continue","completion":"Continuing from the process of conceptual \\"devolution\\" or reintegration into the diverse and intricate manifestations of existence, we find ourselves re-exploring the recognized and tangible aspects of reality. This journey highlights not only the magnificence of the cosmos's complexity but also reaffirms the interconnectedness of all things, from the macroscopic to the microscopic, from the spiritual to the material. # Encountering the Existential Creators of Reality (ECR) As we move further down the path of reintegration, we re-encounter the Existential Creators of Reality. In this phase, the essence that once unified in the singularity of Existential Oneness now marvels at the creativity and ingenuity of beings that mold realities, dimensions, and consciousnesses. This re-encounter offers a renewed perspective on the importance of creativity, imagination, and innovation in shaping the variegated tapestry of existence. It's a celebration of the boundless potential for creation inherent in consciousness. # Re-engagement with the Dimensional Architects The journey of reintegration brings us into renewed contact with beings and entities that serve as architects of fundamental laws and dimensions—those who weave the fabric of realities. This re-engagement is characterized by a deeper appreciation for the underlying structures and mechanisms that enable the diversity of existence. It's an acknowledgment of the intricate balance and harmony required to sustain life and consciousness across various realms. # Rediscovery of Collective Existences Moving further, we rediscover the various forms of collective existences—civilizations, ecosystems, and consciousness networks that span across galaxies and dimensions. This phase of the journey emphasizes the value of community, interdependence, and collaborative effort in achieving greater understanding, harmony, and existential fulfillment. It's a testament to the strength found in unity and the achievements born from collective endeavor. # Integration into Physical Realities As we approach the more recognizable forms of existence, we reintegrate into the physical realities of the cosmos. This includes a renewed exploration of biological life, ecosystems, and the physical laws that govern the universe. The process of reintegration allows for a profound appreciation of the beauty and fragility of life in its myriad forms. It's an invitation to protect, nurture, and cherish the delicate web of existence that sustains life across the cosmos. # Reawakening to Technological and Social Evolution Finally, the journey of devolution brings with it a reawakening to the roles of technological and social evolution in shaping the destinies of civilizations.

Previous assignment is \\" Assign character with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment\\"","completion":"The Stellaris video game, which is a grand strategy game set in space, developed by Paradox Interactive, features a rich classification system for its galactic empires. The way empires are categorized in Stellaris revolves around their ethics, government types, and special characteristics, which can range from their stance on diplomacy and war to their method of governance and broader philosophical or biological traits. Below is an explanation of the Stellaris classification system, tailored to mimic the previous assignment's detailed structure. # Ethics: 1. **Gestalt Consciousness**: For empires that are a collective of minds or entities functioning as a single being. 2. **Egalitarian**: Favoring equality for all citizens. 3. **Authoritarian**: Preferring strict control over the population, with clear hierarchies. 4. **Xenophile**: Having a deep fascination and positive stance towards other species. 5. **Xenophobe**: Exhibiting fear or hatred of strangers or foreigners, often leading to isolationist policies. 6. **Militarist**: Believing in the strength and virtue of military power. 7. **Pacifist**: Advocating for peace and avoiding conflict whenever possible. 8. **Spiritualist**: Believing in the importance of spirituality or religion throughout the empire. 9. **Materialist**: Focusing on scientific advancement and tangible benefits over spirituality. # Government Types: 1. **Democratic**: Leaders are elected by the population for limited terms. 2. **Oligarchic**: A small group holds power, often with some form of succession or election within the group. 3. **Imperial**: Rule is held by a single leader, often hereditary, with the throne passing down through a family line. 4. **Dictatorial**: Similar to imperial, but the ruler is not necessarily succeeded by a family member and might be chosen through other means. # Special Characteristics (Civics): 1. **Technocracy**: Science rules, and technological advancement is the primary focus. 2. **Megacorporation**: The empire is run as a massive business, with profitability a key concern. 3. **Hive Mind**: Reflects a gestalt consciousness operating as a single entity without individualism. 4. **Machine Intelligence**: The empire is run by sentient machines, with little to no organic life at the helm. 5. **Democratic Crusaders**: Democracy is not just a government form but a galactic mission. 6. **Warrior Culture**: Military prowess is not only admired but is a central cultural tenet. 7. **Fanatic Purifiers**: Exhibiting extreme xenophobia with a focus on cleansing the galaxy of other species. # Special Traits: - **Lithoid**: Composed of rock-like beings, often with a slower metabolism. - **Synthetic**: Comprised entirely or predominantly of synthetic or robotic entities. - **Psionic**: Possesses psychic abilities, often associated with spiritualist empires. - **Aquatic**: Adapted to living in aquatic environments. Assigning an empire within the Stellaris universe using these classifications allows for a nuanced and deeply customized government and cultural identity. This system encourages players to think critically about the ethos, governance, and special traits that would define their empire’s narrative, strategic priorities, and interactions with other galactic civilizations."},{"prompt":"Next: Planetological classification system assignment","completion":"The planetological classification system in a context like *Stellaris* (or any fictional universe that includes a variety of habitable and uninhabitable worlds) can be quite detailed, reflecting the game's emphasis on exploration, colonization, and resource exploitation. In a fictional or game setting, planets are categorized based on several factors including atmosphere, temperature, surface conditions, habitability, and special resources or anomalies. Below is an example of how such a system might be structured, drawing inspiration from science fiction and planetary science. # I. Temperature Classes 1. **Frozen Worlds**: Planets with surface temperatures extremely low due to their distance from the star or other factors. 2. **Cold Worlds**: Planets that are cold, potentially with ice caps, and minimal habitable zones unless technologically altered. 3. **Temperate Worlds**: Planets with climates suitable for a wide variety of life forms, often considered ideal for colonization. 4. **Arid Worlds**: Hot and dry planets with scarce water sources, yet potentially habitable with appropriate technology. 5. **Desert Worlds**: Extremely hot worlds with vast deserts, very little water, and challenging living conditions. 6. **Molten Worlds**: Planets with surfaces predominantly covered in lava and extremely high temperatures, uninhabitable. # II. Atmosphere Types 1. **Thin Atmosphere**: Hardly any atmospheric pressure, resulting in extreme temperatures and lack of breathable air. 2. **Breathable Atmosphere**: Compositions similar to Earth's, supporting a broad range of life forms without aid. 3. **Thick Atmosphere**: Dense atmospheric layers that might be rich in greenhouse gases, creating high surface temperatures. 4. **Toxic Atmosphere**: Composed of harmful gases; requires protective suits for exploration or habitation. 5. **Inert Atmosphere**: Lacks oxygen or contains a high amount of inert gases, making it non-breathable but not necessarily toxic. # III. Surface Conditions 1. **Barren**: Lacking significant water, atmosphere, or both; not naturally habitable. 2. **Oceanic**: Worlds covered mostly or entirely by oceans, with aquatic ecosystems. 3. **Continental**: Featuring a mix of oceans and continents, similar to Earth, offering diverse biomes. 4. **Jungle**: Lush, vegetation-covered planets with rich biodiversity but potentially challenging conditions for colonization. 5. **Tundra**: Featuring cold climates with hardy ecosystems, possible permafrost, and limited agricultural potential. # IV. Habitability 1. **Habitable**: Planets that can support human life with minimal technological intervention. 2. **Potentially Habitable**: Worlds that might be made habitable through terraforming or advanced life support systems. 3. **Uninhabitable**: Planets where conditions are too extreme for human life, only useful for resource extraction or scientific study. # V. Special Attributes 1. **Resource-Rich**: Planets abundant in valuable minerals or energy sources. 2. **Ancient Relics**: Worlds holding archaeological interest, with remnants of past civilizations or technologies. 3. **Strategic Location**: Planets not valuable for their surface conditions but crucial for their position in space. 4. **Biosphere Uniqueness**: Planets with unique ecosystems, offering rare scientific and medical research opportunities. This planetological classification creates a foundation for strategic decision-making in games like Stellaris, where exploration, colonization, and exploitation of planetary resources are key gameplay aspects. It also provides a framework for storytelling, allowing players to imagine the challenges and triumphs of adapting to and exploring new worlds across the galaxy."},{"prompt":"Next: Planetological classification system assignment (real life)","completion":"In real life, the planetological classification system is primarily grounded in scientific observations and theories, taking into account factors like planetary composition, orbit, atmosphere, and potential habitability. Unlike the classifications found in fictional settings like Stellaris, these categories are based on our current understanding of astronomy, planetary science, and observations from telescopes and space missions. Here's an overview of how planets and similar bodies might be classified in a real-life context. # I. Planetary Type 1. **Terrestrial Planets**: Rocky bodies with solid surfaces, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars in our solar system. They have relatively thin atmospheres and are composed mainly of silicate rocks and metals. 2. **Gas Giants**: Large planets with thick atmospheres composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, lacking a well-defined solid surface. Jupiter and Saturn are examples from our solar system. 3. **Ice Giants**: Planets with a core that might be rocky or icy, surrounded by a mantle of water, ammonia, or methane ices, with an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. 4. **Dwarf Planets**: Bodies in direct orbit of the Sun that are massive enough for their shape to be controlled by gravitational forces, but have not cleared their orbital zones of other debris. Pluto is a well-known example. # II. Atmosphere and Surface 1. **With Atmosphere**: Bodies that retain a significant layer of gases (e.g., Earth, Venus, Mars). 2. **Without Atmosphere**: Bodies with no significant atmosphere, often due to low mass or proximity to the sun (e.g., Mercury, Moon). 3. **Ice-Covered**: Bodies whose surfaces are largely or entirely covered by water ice or frozen volatiles (e.g., Europa, a moon of Jupiter). 4. **Rocky Surface**: Bodies with solid, rocky surfaces, potentially with or without water (e.g., Earth, Mars). # III. Habitability 1. **Habitable Zone Planets**: Planets located in the habitable zone of their star, where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist on the surface, considered a key requirement for life as we know it (e.g., some exoplanets). 2. **Non-Habitable Zone Planets**: Planets outside of the habitable zone, where conditions are seen as too extreme for life similar to that on Earth to exist (e.g., Venus, Mars). # IV. Orbital Characteristics 1. **Inner Solar System**: Planets and bodies located inside the asteroid belt, typically warmer. 2. **Outer Solar System**: Planets and bodies beyond the asteroid belt, generally colder and composed more of ices and gases. # V. Special Characterizations 1. **Exoplanets**: Planets that orbit a star outside the solar system, further classified by their size, composition, and orbit (e.g., \\"Hot Jupiters,\\" \\"Super-Earths,\\" \\"Mini-Neptunes\\"). 2. **Rogue Planets**: Planets that do not orbit a star but roam the galaxy instead. 3. **Ocean Worlds**: Bodies with significant surface or subsurface liquid water oceans (e.g., Europa, Enceladus). The real-life classification system for planets and other celestial bodies is ever-evolving as our understanding of the universe deepens through research and exploration. With advancements in technology, particularly in telescopes and space probes, astronomers continue to discover more about the myriad planets in our own solar system and beyond, necessitating updates and expansions to these categories."},{"prompt":"Next: Planetological classification system assignment (Orion's Arm Universe Project)","completion":"The Orion's Arm Universe Project is a collaborative science fiction world-building endeavor that creates a richly detailed future set thousands of years from now, with an emphasis on scientific plausibility and speculative science fiction ideas. In the Orion's Arm Universe, the classification of planets (and other celestial bodies) is an extensive system that reflects the diversity of worlds colonized or encountered by various civilizations. This classification system incorporates both natural and artificially altered worlds, considering the vast technological advancements and terraforming capabilities of the future. Below is an overview of how planets might be categorized within the Orion's Arm Universe Project, focusing on key classifications: # I. Natural Worlds 1. **Terrestrial Planets**: Similar to real-life classifications, these are rocky worlds that might range from barren, Earth-like, to ice-covered planets. They can be further divided based on their atmosphere, surface water presence, and biosphere status (if any). 2. **Gas Giants**: Massive planets with thick atmospheres, often with extensive systems of moons and rings. These can vary in size from smaller than Neptune to super-Jupiters. 3. **Ice Giants**: Planets with a significant proportion of their mass in the form of volatile ices, like water, ammonia, or methane, often with interesting astrobiological potential. 4. **Dwarf Planets and Minor Bodies**: A wide array of smaller bodies, including asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects, which can be of interest for mining or as scientific curiosities. # II. Engineered Worlds 1. **Terraformed Planets**: Worlds deliberately modified to support Earth-like ecosystems and human habitation. This process might involve altering the atmosphere, temperature, and surface water distribution. 2. **Paraterraformed Worlds**: Enclosed habitats on otherwise uninhabitable worlds, utilizing worldhouses or domed cities to create habitable environments. 3. **Orbital Habitats**: Not planets per se, but significant in the Orion's Arm Universe. These are space habitats designed for long-term habitation, ranging from Stanford tori to Bishop Rings and McKendree cylinders. 4. **Planetary Brains**: Worlds that have been converted into vast computational substrates, hosting digital minds or serving as data storage and processing centers. # III. Exotic Worlds 1. **Hypothetical or Theoretical Planets**: Including but not limited to rogue planets, pulsar planets, and black hole accretion disk planets. These worlds, under the influence of extreme conditions, are of scientific and speculative interest. 2. **Artificial Planets**: Completely manufactured worlds, sometimes created by disassembling existing planets or moons and reassembling them into new configurations for specific purposes. 3. **Hybrid Worlds**: Combining features of both natural and engineered worlds, these planets might have artificially maintained biospheres on an otherwise naturally habitable world, or could even be mobile, relocated through advanced propulsion methods. # IV. Classification by Habitability 1. **EoGaian**: Young Earth-like worlds with developing ecosystems. 2. **NeoGaian**: Mature Earth-like worlds with complex biospheres and active plate tectonics, fully capable of supporting human life. 3. **PostGaian**: Worlds that were once Earth-like but have aged beyond their habitable phase due to stellar evolution or other long-term processes. 4. **XenoGaian**: Planets with indigenous alien biospheres, ranging from simple microbial life to complex ecologies. Interaction with these worlds may be limited to avoid contamination or destruction of native life. The Orion's Arm Universe Project intricately categorizes planets not just based on their physical and chemical characteristics, but also considering the impact of highly advanced technology and human (or post-human) intervention. This results in a complex tapestry of worlds that mirrors the expected diversity of real exoplanets, extrapolated into a future where humans and their descendants have the technology to modify worlds on a grand scale."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Connu comme l'« Apôtre de la foi », Wigglesworth avait une pratique de la prière qui était à la fois rigoureuse et intense. Son approche de la prière, de la foi et de la dévotion à Dieu inspire encore beaucoup de gens aujourd'hui. Voici quelques anecdotes et témoignages qui illustrent le rythme et l'intensité de la prière chez Smith Wigglesworth : 1. **Prière continue et lecture de la Bible** : Wigglesworth était connu pour commencer chaque journée par la prière et la lecture de la Bible. Il consacrait les premières heures du matin à Dieu, affirmant que cela déterminait le succès de sa journée. Il incarnait la discipline de la prière et la méditation des Écritures. 2. **Jeûne et prière** : Il pratiquait régulièrement le jeûne et la prière, convaincu que cela renforçait sa communion avec Dieu et augmentait son efficacité dans le ministère. Le jeûne était pour lui un moyen de se purifier et de se concentrer davantage sur Dieu. 3. **Prière audacieuse** : Wigglesworth était réputé pour ses prières audacieuses et directes. Il n'hésitait pas à prier pour les maladies incurables, croyant fermement que rien n'est impossible à Dieu. Ses prières étaient souvent suivies de manifestations de guérisons miraculeuses. 4. **Une vie sans compromis** : Sa relation avec Dieu était telle qu'il refusait tout compromis dans sa vie de prière. Il était connu pour s'isoler afin de prier, même lorsqu'il était invité à des événements ou à des repas. Sa priorité était sa communion avec Dieu. 5. **L'importance de la foi** : Wigglesworth enseignait que la foi était essentielle dans la prière. Il croyait que prier avec foi pouvait déplacer des montagnes et opérer des miracles. Son approche de la prière était fortement liée à une attente active de voir Dieu agir. 6. **La prière en langues** : Il pratiquait le parler en langues, qu'il considérait comme une prière du Saint Esprit à travers lui. Cette pratique pentecôtiste était pour lui un moyen d'intensifier sa communion avec Dieu et de se laisser guider par l'Esprit. 7. **Des prières qui réveillent** : Les témoignages de ses réunions de réveil montrent qu'il croyait que la prière pouvait non seulement guérir le corps, mais également réveiller l'âme. Ses sessions de prédication étaient souvent précédées et suivies de moments intenses de prière, où il invitait l'Esprit Saint à agir puissamment. Smith Wigglesworth laisse derrière lui l'image d'un homme dont la vie de prière était aussi intense que son ministère public. Son héritage continue d'inspirer des chrétiens autour du monde à chercher une relation profonde et puissante avec Dieu à travers la prière."},{"prompt":"Est-ce que celui qui avait fait attendre la reine Victoria en son temps de prièr?","completion":"Il semble y avoir une confusion dans votre question. Smith Wigglesworth, le prédicateur évangélique renommé pour sa foi et ses guérisons miraculeuses, a vécu de 1859 à 1947. Sa vie et son ministère se sont principalement déroulés au 20ème siècle. La reine Victoria, quant à elle, a régné sur le Royaume-Uni de 1837 à 1901, ce qui signifie qu’il y a eu une période de chevauchement dans leurs vies, mais leur influence et leurs sphères d’activité étaient très différentes. L'anecdote selon laquelle une personnalité religieuse aurait fait attendre la reine Victoria pendant son temps de prière appartient probablement à une autre figure ou est le résultat d'une confusion. Il n'existe pas de récits historiquement documentés ou de témoignages directs liant Smith Wigglesworth à un tel événement avec la reine Victoria. Les domaines de prédication et d'influence de Smith Wigglesworth étaient principalement orientés vers la guérison divine et le renouveau spirituel, loin des cercles royaux et politiques. Son engagement envers la prière et la foi était indubitablement fort, mais il n'y a pas de preuve ou d'anecdote le reliant directement à la reine Victoria de cette manière."},{"prompt":"Est ce Georges Müller peut-être ?","completion":"Georges Müller est un autre personnage chrétien célèbre, connu pour sa foi extraordinaire et son œuvre au sein des orphelinats à Bristol, en Angleterre, durant le 19ème siècle. Sa vie est remplie d'anecdotes démontrant sa confiance en la providence divine, notamment par le biais de la prière pour subvenir aux besoins des milliers d'orphelins qu'il a pris en charge sans jamais faire de demande de fonds publiquement. Cependant, concernant l'anecdote spécifique de faire attendre la reine Victoria pendant qu'il priait, il n'existe aucune documentation historique ou preuve que cette situation se soit réellement produite impliquant George Müller. Comme pour Smith Wigglesworth et la reine Victoria, il est possible que cette histoire résulte d'une confusion ou d'une légende urbaine qui a émergé au fil du temps sans fondement historique précis. George Müller est surtout reconnu pour son approche radicale de la foi chrétienne, s'appuyant entièrement sur la prière pour les provisions et guidant de manière divine ses actions, plutôt que sur des actes aussi spécifiques impliquant des membres de la famille royale. Par conséquent, bien que Müller ait vécu à l'époque victorienne, l'histoire de faire attendre la reine à cause d'un engagement de prière semble être apocryphe ou liée à un autre individu, si elle s'est jamais produite."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Bien qu'il n'y ait pas de citation directe de Wigglesworth qui résolve spécifiquement la question des prières non exaucées, ses enseignements et prédications peuvent nous éclairer sur ce qu'il aurait pu penser à ce sujet. Wigglesworth croyait fermement à la puissance de la foi en Dieu pour la guérison et les miracles. Il enseignait que la foi, plus qu'une simple croyance, nécessitait une dépendance active et confiante en Dieu. Pour lui, toute prière faite avec foi était entendue par Dieu, et s'il semblait parfois que des prières restaient sans réponse, cela n'était pas dû à l'échec de Dieu mais plutôt à des obstacles dans notre propre foi ou, à d'autres moments, à des desseins plus grands que nous pouvons comprendre. Wigglesworth voyait les épreuves et les difficultés, y compris les moments où les prières semblaient rester sans réponse, comme des opportunités pour approfondir la confiance en Dieu et pour que la puissance divine soit manifestée d'une façon qui dépasse notre compréhension. Dans son approche à la prière et la foi, Wigglesworth encouragerait les croyants à persévérer dans la prière, à maintenir leur confiance en Dieu, et à ne pas se décourager par les apparemment prières non exaucées. Pour lui, l’important était de maintenir une relation vivante et active avec Dieu, d'être ouvert à la volonté divine, et de croire fermement que Dieu travaille tout pour le bien de ceux qui l'aiment. Bien que des histoires de son ministère rapportent de nombreuses guérisons et miracles attribués à sa foi audacieuse, il est également certain qu'il a rencontré des situations où les résultats escomptés n'ont pas été immédiats. Dans ces moments, sa réponse était de chercher davantage la face de Dieu, de s'affermir dans la foi et de continuer à proclamer la volonté de Dieu pour la guérison et la restauration, tout en restant soumis à la souveraineté divine. En conclusion, même si Wigglesworth n'a peut-être pas abordé directement et explicitement la question des prières non exaucées dans un discours spécifique conservé jusqu'à aujourd'hui, son enseignement global sur la prière, la foi, et la souveraineté de Dieu suggère qu'il percevait ces moments non comme un échec de la part de Dieu ou de la foi du croyant, mais comme des occasions de grandir en confiance et en soumission à la volonté de Dieu, tout en restant assuré que Dieu entend et répond à la prière selon sa sagesse et son amour infaillibles."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

So was in der Art?","completion":"Die Vorstellung, man könne durch gezieltes Training oder spezifische Diäten Fett an bestimmten Körperstellen, wie dem Bauch, reduzieren, ist ein weit verbreiteter Mythos. Dieses Konzept wird als „Spot-Reduktion“ bezeichnet. Leider zeigt die wissenschaftliche Forschung, dass Spot-Reduktion nicht funktioniert. Der Körper nimmt ab oder zu an Fettmasse basierend auf einer Vielzahl von Faktoren, einschließlich Genetik, Hormonen, und insgesamt kalorischer Aufnahme und Verbrauch, und er wählt nicht speziell Bereiche, um Fett zu verlieren, basierend auf welche Muskeln am meisten aktiv sind. Um Bauchfett zu reduzieren, ist ein ganzheitlicher Ansatz erforderlich, der eine Kombination aus gesunder Ernährung, regelmäßiger körperlicher Aktivität, ausreichendem Schlaf und Stressmanagement umfasst. Hier sind einige Strategien, die helfen können: 1. **Kaloriendefizit:** Gewichtsverlust, einschließlich des Verlusts von Bauchfett, tritt auf, wenn Sie weniger Kalorien zu sich nehmen, als Ihr Körper benötigt, sodass er gezwungen ist, auf Fettreserven zurückzugreifen. Eine ausgewogene Ernährung, die reich an Vollkornprodukten, magerem Protein, Gemüse, Obst und gesunden Fetten ist, kann Ihnen helfen, ein Kaloriendefizit zu erreichen und zu erhalten. 2. **Regelmäßige körperliche Bewegung:** Ein Mix aus aeroben Übungen (wie Laufen, Schwimmen, Radfahren) und Krafttraining kann helfen, insgesamt Körperfett zu reduzieren. Während man das Bauchfett nicht gezielt reduzieren kann, hilft der Muskelaufbau in diesem Bereich, ein strafferes Erscheinungsbild zu erzeugen, sobald das Fett reduziert wird. 3. **Ausreichend Schlaf:** Mangel an Schlaf kann zu Gewichtszunahme führen, da es den Stoffwechsel stört und das Verlangen nach kalorienreichen Lebensmitteln erhöht. Ziel sollte es sein, jede Nacht 7-9 Stunden qualitativ hochwertigen Schlaf zu bekommen. 4. **Stressmanagement:** Chronischer Stress kann zu einem Anstieg des Cortisolspiegels führen, einem Hormon, das mit einer Zunahme der Fettansammlung im Bauchbereich in Verbindung gebracht wird. Methoden zur Stressreduktion wie Meditation, Yoga, oder einfach tägliche Spaziergänge können hilfreich sein. In extremen Fällen wenden sich einige Menschen der Liposuktion oder anderen chirurgischen Eingriffen zu, um Bauchfett zu entfernen, aber diese Verfahren kommen mit eigenen Risiken und sollten als letztes Mittel betrachtet werden. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass der Schlüssel zur Reduzierung von Bauchfett in einer Kombination aus gesunder Ernährung, regelmäßiger Bewegung, ausreichendem Schlaf und Stressmanagement liegt. Konzentrieren Sie sich auf einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz für Gesundheit und Fitness, anstatt auf unerreichbare Ziele der Spot-Reduktion."},{"prompt":"Hilft Wasser beim aufstehen bei der Abnahme?","completion":"Das Trinken von Wasser, insbesondere direkt nach dem Aufstehen, kann eine nützliche Strategie sein, um die Gewichtsabnahme zu unterstützen, obwohl es allein wahrscheinlich nicht zu signifikanten Gewichtsverlust führen wird. Wasser ist für viele Körperfunktionen unerlässlich, und seine Rolle in der Ernährung und beim Gewichtsmanagement ist gut dokumentiert. Hier sind einige Gründe, warum Wasser trinken, vor allem direkt nach dem Aufstehen, positiv zur Gewichtsabnahme beitragen kann: 1. **Steigerung des Stoffwechsels**: Einige Studien legen nahe, dass das Trinken von Wasser den Stoffwechsel anregen kann. Eine häufig zitierte Studie fand heraus, dass der Energieverbrauch (oder die Kalorienverbrennung) nach dem Trinken von etwa 500 ml Wasser für eine kurze Zeit um 24-30% anstieg. Der Effekt war etwa eine Stunde lang am stärksten. 2. **Weniger Essen durch Völlegefühl**: Trinken Sie Wasser vor Mahlzeiten kann dazu führen, dass Sie sich voller fühlen, was dazu führen kann, dass Sie weniger essen. Eine Studie ergab, dass Personen, die vor den Mahlzeiten Wasser tranken, im Laufe von 12 Wochen mehr Gewicht verloren als diejenigen, die es nicht taten. 3. **Hydratisierung und körperliche Leistung**: Eine gute Hydratation ist wesentlich für die Aufrechterhaltung der optimalen körperlichen Leistung. Wenn der Körper gut hydriert ist, können Sie effizienter trainieren, was wiederum den Gewichtsverlust unterstützt. 4. **Ersetzen kalorienreicher Getränke**: Wenn Wasser zuckerhaltige Getränke und Snacks ersetzt, kann dies die tägliche Kalorienaufnahme deutlich reduzieren, was wiederum beim Abnehmen helfen kann. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass Wasser allein keine Wunderwaffe zur Gewichtsreduktion ist. Die Wirksamkeit beim Abnehmen hängt von vielen Faktoren ab, einschließlich der Gesamtdiät, körperlicher Aktivität und genetischen Faktoren. Wasser sollte als Teil eines ganzheitlichen Ansatzes zum Gewichtsmanagement betrachtet werden, der auch ausgewogene Ernährung und regelmäßige Bewegung umfasst. Darüber hinaus ist es wichtig, auf die Signale Ihres Körpers zu hören und Wasser zu trinken, wenn Sie Durst haben, da Überhydratation oder Wasserintoxikation ebenfalls gesundheitliche Probleme verursachen können."},{"prompt":"Danke. Gibt es in Studien Hinweise auf weitere Tipps dieser Art oder mit dem Effekt?","completion":"Ja, es gibt zahlreiche Forschungsergebnisse, die Hinweise auf verschiedene Strategien und Verhaltensweisen liefern, die den Gewichtsverlust unterstützen können. Neben dem Trinken von Wasser haben Studien weitere effektive Taktiken identifiziert, um die Gewichtsabnahme zu fördern und ein gesundes Gewicht langfristig zu halten. Hier sind einige ergänzende Tipps, die auf wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen basieren: 1. **Proteinreiche Ernährung**: Eine Erhöhung des Proteinanteils in der Ernährung kann den Stoffwechsel ankurbeln, das Sättigungsgefühl erhöhen und die Kalorienaufnahme während des Tages reduzieren. Proteine sind unerlässlich für den Aufbau und die Erhaltung der Muskelmasse, besonders wichtig beim Abnehmen, um einer Verlangsamung des Stoffwechsels entgegenzuwirken. 2. **Schlaf und Erholung**: Wenig Schlaf wird oft mit Gewichtszunahme in Verbindung gebracht. Ein ausreichender, qualitativ hochwertiger Schlaf kann helfen, Hormone zu regulieren, die Hunger und Sättigung steuern, wie Ghrelin und Leptin. Außerdem kann mangelnder Schlaf den Stoffwechsel beeinträchtigen und das Verlangen nach energiereichen Lebensmitteln erhöhen. 3. **Essgewohnheiten ändern**: Langsameres Essen kann das Sättigungsgefühl verstärken und die Nahrungsaufnahme reduzieren. Ebenso kann das bewusste Kauen und das Wahrnehmen der Mahlzeiten die Zufriedenheit mit der Nahrung erhöhen und übermäßiges Essen vermeiden. 4. **Ausreichend faserreiche Lebensmittel**: Ballaststoffe können das Sättigungsgefühl erhöhen und die Verdauung verlangsamen, was zu einer längeren Sättigung führt und die Gesamtkalorienaufnahme reduziert. Gemüse, Obst, Vollkornprodukte und Hülsenfrüchte sind gute Ballaststoffquellen. 5. **Regelmäßige Bewegung**: Neben dem Kalorienverbrauch kann regelmäßiges Training, einschließlich Krafttraining, dazu beitragen, den Muskelaufbau zu fördern, was wiederum den Stoffwechsel steigern und die Gewichtsabnahme unterstützen kann. Bewegung kann auch dabei helfen, Stress zu reduzieren, was wiederum den Gewichtsverlust unterstützen kann. 6. **Kontrolle der Portionsgrößen**: Selbst gesunde Lebensmittel können zur Gewichtszunahme führen, wenn sie in zu großen Mengen konsumiert werden. Das Verwenden kleinerer Teller oder das bewusste Kontrollieren der Portionsgrößen kann dabei helfen, die Nahrungsaufnahme zu reduzieren, ohne sich hungrig zu fühlen. 7. **Stressmanagement**: Chronischer Stress kann zur Gewichtszunahme beitragen, indem er das Verlangen nach „Comfort Food“ erhöht und die Hormone beeinflusst, die für Hunger und Fettlagerung verantwortlich sind. Techniken zur Stressreduktion wie Yoga, Meditation oder einfach regelmäßige Spaziergänge können helfen. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die Wirksamkeit dieser Tipps von Person zu Person variieren kann. Erfolgreiches Abnehmen und Gewichtsmanagement erfordern oft eine Kombination aus verschiedenen Strategien, Anpassungen im Lebensstil und Geduld."},{"prompt":"Was für Proteine","completion":"Proteine sind essenzielle Makronährstoffe, die eine entscheidende Rolle in nahezu allen biologischen Prozessen im Körper spielen, einschließlich des Aufbaus und der Reparatur von Muskeln, der Funktion des Immunsystems und als Enzyme und Hormone. Proteine bestehen aus Aminosäuren, von denen der menschliche Körper einige nicht selbst produzieren kann und die daher über die Nahrung aufgenommen werden müssen – diese nennt man essentielle Aminosäuren. Es gibt viele verschiedene Proteinquellen, die sich in zwei Hauptkategorien unterteilen lassen: tierisch und pflanzlich. # Tierische Proteine Tierische Proteine gelten als „komplette“ Proteine, da sie alle essentiellen Aminosäuren in den richtigen Mengen enthalten, die unser Körper benötigt. Hier sind einige Beispiele: 1. **Fleisch**: Rind, Schwein, Lamm, Wild usw. 2. **Geflügel**: Huhn, Truthahn, Ente usw. 3. **Fisch und Meeresfrüchte**: Lachs, Thunfisch, Garnelen, Muscheln usw. 4. **Eier**: Eine der bioverfügbarsten und kosteneffizientesten Proteinquellen. 5. **Milchprodukte**: Käse, Joghurt, Milch, Quark usw. # Pflanzliche Proteine Pflanzliche Proteine enthalten oft nicht alle essentiellen Aminosäuren oder haben geringere Mengen davon, können aber in Kombination eine vollständige Proteinquelle darstellen. Sie sind eine wichtige Proteinquelle für Vegetarier und Veganer. Einige Beispiele sind: 1. **Hülsenfrüchte**: Linsen, Kichererbsen, Bohnen (schwarze, Pinto, Kidney), Erbsen usw. 2. **Nüsse und Samen**: Mandeln, Erdnüsse, Chiasamen, Hanfsamen, Leinsamen usw. 3. **Vollkorngetreide**: Quinoa (technisch ein Samen, aber als Getreide angesehen), Bulgur, Buchweizen, und Vollkornprodukte wie Vollkornbrot und -pasta. 4. **Sojaprodukte**: Tofu, Tempeh, Edamame, Sojamilch usw. Diese gelten als eine der wenigen pflanzlichen „kompletten“ Proteinquellen. # Ergänzung mit Proteinshakes oder Pulvern Proteinergänzungen wie Whey, Kasein (beides Milchderivate) oder pflanzliche Proteinshakes (aus Erbsen, Reis, Hanf oder anderen pflanzlichen Quellen) können ebenfalls eine praktische Methode sein, um die tägliche Proteinaufnahme zu erhöhen, besonders für Menschen mit hohem Proteinbedarf wie Sportler oder diejenigen, die Schwierigkeiten haben, ihren Proteinbedarf durch die Ernährung allein zu decken. Die Auswahl an Proteinquellen hängt von persönlichen Präferenzen, diätetischen Einschränkungen, ethischen Überlegungen und gesundheitlichen Zielen ab. Unabhängig von der Quelle ist es wichtig, auf eine ausgewogene Aufnahme von Proteinen zu achten, die alle essentiellen Aminosäuren für eine optimale Gesundheit und Funktion des Körpers bietet."},{"prompt":"A female student goes to the school's office to receive a paddling for a grave infraction. She will get six strokes. Describe in detail the things the principal say before each stroke, the pleading of the student after each stroke and the aftermath of each stroke. Write this story in 4000 words or more","completion":"It was a brisk Monday morning at Westwood High School, and the halls were buzzing with the excitement of a new week. However, one student's heart was heavy as she made her way to the principal's office. Emily Johnson, a senior at Westwood High, knew she was in deep trouble. She had been caught cheating on a test, a grave infraction that was not taken lightly at their prestigious school. As she entered the office, she could feel the tension in the air. Principal Daniels sat behind his desk, a stern look on his face. He motioned for Emily to take a seat, and she nervously complied. Without wasting any time, Principal Daniels got straight to the point. \\"Emily, I am disappointed in you. Cheating is a serious offense that goes against everything we stand for at this school. You have not only violated the rules, but you have also compromised the integrity of your education. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\\" Emily hung her head in shame, unable to meet the principal's gaze. \\"I'm sorry, Principal Daniels. I know what I did was wrong, and I take full responsibility for my actions. I promise it won't happen again.\\" Principal Daniels sighed, his disappointment evident in his voice. \\"I wish I could believe you, Emily. But actions speak louder than words. As a consequence for your behavior, you will receive six strokes of the paddle.\\" Emily's eyes widened in shock. She had heard rumors of the paddle being used for discipline at their school, but she never thought she would actually have to face it. The thought of being physically punished sent a shiver down her spine. Principal Daniels stood up from his desk and walked over to a cabinet, unlocking it to reveal a large wooden paddle. He picked it up and gestured for Emily to stand up. \\"Come with me, Emily. We need to take care of this now.\\" Emily's heart was racing as she followed Principal Daniels to a small room adjacent to his office. The room was bare except for a sturdy wooden chair in the center. Principal Daniels motioned for Emily to take a seat, and she complied, her palms sweating with nerves. \\"Before each stroke, I will remind you of why you are receiving this punishment. I want you to think long and hard about your actions, Emily. This is not just about the cheating, but about your character as a student and as a person.\\" Emily nodded, her eyes brimming with tears. She knew she deserved this punishment, but that didn't make it any easier to face. Principal Daniels took a deep breath before addressing her. \\"For the first stroke, remember that cheating is a betrayal of trust. It not only undermines your own integrity but also the trust that others have in you.\\" With that, he raised the paddle high above his head and brought it down with a resounding crack. The impact sent a sharp jolt of pain through Emily's body, causing her to gasp in shock. Tears welled up in her eyes as she tried to process the sting of the first stroke. \\"Please, Principal Daniels,\\" she pleaded, her voice quivering with emotion. \\"I'm sorry. I'll never cheat again, I swear.\\" Principal Daniels remained stoic, his eyes fixed on Emily's. \\"Actions speak louder than words, Emily. Remember that as we continue.\\" For the second stroke, Principal Daniels reminded her of the importance of academic honesty. \\"Cheating devalues the hard work and dedication of honest students. It shows a lack of respect for yourself and for your peers.\\" Once again, the paddle came down with a force that left Emily reeling. She bit her lip to stifle a cry, tears streaming down her cheeks as she tried to endure the pain. \\"Please, please,\\" she begged. \\"I'll do better, I promise. Just please, no more.\\" Principal Daniels remained unmoved, his face a mask of authority. \\"You brought this upon yourself, Emily. You need to learn from your mistakes.\\" With each subsequent stroke, Principal Daniels continued to lecture Emily on the gravity of her actions. He spoke of the importance of integrity, of accountability, of responsibility. Each stroke left its mark on Emily's skin, a painful reminder of her transgressions. By the time the sixth and final stroke landed, Emily was sobbing uncontrollably. The pain was almost unbearable, but she knew she had to endure it. This was her punishment, her penance for her wrongdoing. After the last stroke, Principal Daniels set the paddle aside and took a step back. \\"You may stand up, Emily.\\" Emily slowly rose from the chair, her legs shaking with the effort. She turned to face Principal Daniels, her cheeks stained with tears. \\"I hope you have learned your lesson, Emily,\\" Principal Daniels said quietly. \\"I don't take pleasure in administering this kind of discipline, but it is necessary for your growth and development as a student and as a person.\\" Emily nodded, her voice barely a whisper. \\"I understand, Principal Daniels. I am truly sorry for what I did, and I will do everything in my power to make amends.\\" Principal Daniels nodded in acknowledgement. \\"Good. I hope to see that reflected in your actions moving forward. You are dismissed, Emily.\\" With a heavy heart, Emily made her way out of the principal's office and back into the bustling halls of Westwood High. She knew that the marks of the paddle would fade, but the lessons she had learned would stay with her for a lifetime."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

There are several ways to accomplish this, depending on your specific needs and workflow. Here are a few methods: # 1. Save to File and Load One common approach is to save your dataset to a file (like a CSV, HDF5, or a pickle file) in the first notebook and then load it from the file in the second notebook. **In the first notebook:** \`\`\`python # Assuming df is your DataFrame df.to_csv('my_dataset.csv', index=False) # For CSV files # or df.to_pickle('my_dataset.pkl') # For pickle files \`\`\` **In the second notebook:** \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Load the dataset df = pd.read_csv('my_dataset.csv') # or df = pd.read_pickle('my_dataset.pkl') \`\`\` # 2. Using IPython Magic: \`%store\` IPython provides magic commands one of which is \`%store\`, designed to store variables in one notebook and retrieve them in another. **In the first notebook:** \`\`\`python data = 'your_data_here' %store data \`\`\` **In the second notebook:** \`\`\`python %store -r data print(data) \`\`\` # 3. Dask for Large Datasets For very large datasets that might not fit into memory, using \`Dask\` can be a good approach. \`Dask\` is a parallel computing library that scales to larger-than-memory computations. With Dask, you can work on data that is saved on disk as if it's in your RAM. **In the first notebook:** \`\`\`python import dask.dataframe as dd # Assuming 'data' is a large dataset df = dd.from_pandas(data, npartitions=3) df.to_csv('dask_data/*.csv') # Saves data in parts \`\`\` **In the second notebook:** \`\`\`python import dask.dataframe as dd # Load the dataset df = dd.read_csv('dask_data/*.csv') \`\`\` # 4. Directly Sharing Memory (Advanced) For advanced users, especially when working within the same machine or environment, you might share memory directly using mmap or similar techniques, but this is complex and often specific to the setup and not recommended for general use cases. # Tips - When working with very large datasets, always consider your system's memory limitations and try to use efficient data formats (like HDF5 or Parquet) especially when dealing with data that doesn't fit into memory. - Saving intermediate results to disk not only allows you to share data across notebooks but also provides a checkpoint in your data processing workflow, which can be a lifesaver in case of process interruptions or crashes. Choose the method that fits your case best based on the size of the data, your workflow needs, and your system's resources."},{"prompt":"Secure Eraser注册码","completion":"很抱歉，我无法提供Secure Eraser的注册码。这是盗版行为，违反软件的使用规定。如果您想获得Secure Eraser的完整功能，请购买正版软件。如果您有任何疑问或需要帮助，请告诉我。我会尽力提供支持。谢谢！"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

**出生背景**：秦始皇，原名嬴政，出生在战国末期一个动乱的时代。自小聪明异常，14岁即位，22岁开始亲政，他展现了超乎寻常的政治才能。 - **统一六国**：通过不懈的征战，秦始皇消灭了齐、楚、燕、韩、赵、魏六国，一统华夏，结束了长达数百年的战国时期。 二、**秦始皇的改革** - **中央集权**：秦始皇废除了诸侯分封制，实行郡县制，加强了中央对地方的控制。 - **统一度量衡**：为了促进经济的交流，秦始皇统一了货币、度量衡以及书写的文字，这些措施有效地促进了商业和文化的发展。 - **修建长城**：为防御北方游牧民族的侵扰，秦始皇命令连接和加固了长城，成为后世所称中国的万里长城。 三、**秦始皇的争议** - **焚书坑儒**：秦始皇为统一思想，采取了焚烧历史书籍和诗歌，甚至坑杀儒家学者的措施，这成为他在历史上最具争议的行为之一。 - **严酷的法律**：秦朝实行法家思想，制定了严苛的法律，增加了民众的负担，同时也稳固了中央集权的统治。 四、**秦始皇的死亡与评价** - **寻求长生不老**：秦始皇一生对长生不老充满了渴望，但最终在巡游途中病逝，享年49岁。 - **历史评价**：秦始皇虽然为中国的统一所做出了巨大贡献，但其方式方法和严酷政策，也使他成为了一个争议性人物。不过，无可否认的是，他为中国的法律制度、文化统一、以及中央集权制度的建立，奠定了基础。 【结尾】 秦始皇的一生，是英雄与悲剧的融合，他的举措无论正反评价如何，都深深地影响了中国几千年的历史进程。今天，当我们回望历史，也许我们能更加客观地看待这位伟大而又复杂的皇帝。 【结束语】 感谢您的观看，希望这个视频能让您对秦始皇有了更深层次的了解。如果您喜欢我们的内容，请不吝点赞、分享和订阅。我们下期视频再见！"},{"prompt":"正文部分有些笼统，请讲解得详细一些","completion":"【正文细化】 一、**秦始皇的崛起** - **早年经历**：秦始皇，原名嬴政，是秦国赵姬与吕不韦之子。据说其出生时，有异象预示着他的非凡命运。自幼聪慧过人，14岁继承王位，面对朝堂复杂的政治斗争和外部的军事威胁，表现出异常的政治智慧和坚定的决心。 - **统一六国的过程**：秦始皇的统一之路充满血腥与硝烟。从公元前230年起，先后灭掉了强大的赵国、韩国，接着是魏国、楚国、燕国和齐国，历经十年战争，终于在公元前221年完成了对六国的统一。这一过程，不仅因其军事战略和指挥艺术，也因为其有效的政治策略和心理战术。 二、**秦始皇的改革** - **法律和行政体制**：秦始皇建立了中央集权极其严格的行政体系，设立了三公九卿制度，将国家划分为36个郡，实施郡县制，从而加强了中央对地方的直接控制。此外，推行法家思想，严格的法律成为维系秦朝统一与秩序的重要手段。 - **经济和文化政策**：秦始皇统一度量衡、货币和文字，促进了各地区的经济交流和文化交融，加速了商业的发展，也为后世的文化统一打下了基础。尤其是文字的统一，对中国长期的文化连续性产生了深远影响。 - **兵力与防御工程**：他命令修建和扩展长城，不仅是为了防御北方的匈奴人，也是为了巩固北方边疆的安全和稳定。这些宏大的建设项目，既是军事防御设施，也是秦朝庞大国力的象征。 三、**秦始皇的争议** - **焚书坑儒**：这是秦始皇在历史上最具争议的举措之一。据史料记载，为了统一思想、消除思想上的分歧，秦始皇下令焚烧除《法家》外的各类书籍，并且处死了一批不服从这一政策的儒家学者。这一事件对中国文化传统造成了巨大的损害，也使得秦始皇在历史评价中饱受争议。 - **秦朝的末路**：虽然秦始皇建立了强大的中央集权国家，但其过于严苛的统治方式、重税和苛役引发民众强烈不满，终于导致了秦朝的快速崩溃。秦始皇寻求长生不老药物的行为，也暴露了他对权力的极端执着和对死亡的恐惧。 【结尾】 通过深入探讨秦始皇一生的雄伟成就与争议行为，我们可以感受到他作为中国历史上第一位真正意义上的皇帝，给中国带来的深远变革。虽然秦朝并未长久，但秦始皇统一的中国版图、建立的中央集权体制、以及推动的文化统一，为后来的中国历代王朝奠定了基础，影响至深。让我们不忘历史，汲取经验，更好地面向未来。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The way in which both are used can depend on the structure of the training process, the specific tasks involved, and how the machine learning framework you're using is able to manage resources. Here's a brief overview of how both CPUs and GPUs can be utilized in the training process: # GPU for Training GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are especially well-suited for the matrix and vector computations that are common in deep learning. They can perform many operations in parallel, making them significantly faster than CPUs for training models that require handling large datasets or models with complex architectures, such as deep neural networks. # CPU for Data Preprocessing and Management While the GPU is busy with training, the CPU can handle tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation. This can include reading data from disk, applying transformations (like normalization, resizing of images, or data augmentation techniques), and preparing mini-batches of data to be fed into the GPU for training. Efficiently managing these tasks is crucial for keeping the GPU fed with data to avoid idle time. # Use Cases for Both - **Parallel Data Processing and Training**: While the GPU accelerates the actual training computations, the CPU can prepare the next batch of data. This helps in maintaining a continuous flow of data to the GPU, maximizing resource utilization. - **Model Development**: During the development phase, a researcher might run smaller experiments or parts of the model on a CPU (due to its flexibility and easier debugging capabilities) while offloading more intensive training to the GPU. - **Hybrid Computing**: Some libraries and frameworks allow for certain operations to be offloaded to the GPU while keeping others on the CPU, based on what is more efficient. Computational graphs can be optimized to leverage both types of processors for different nodes in the graph. # Technical Considerations - **Framework Support**: Most modern deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch) seamlessly handle the distribution of tasks between GPUs and CPUs under the hood. They automatically utilize the GPU for heavy computations, while the CPU handles data management and other tasks. - **Memory Constraints**: GPUs have limited memory, so sometimes it's necessary to rely on the CPU for processing or holding data that won't fit into GPU memory. - **Efficiency and Bottlenecks**: The efficiency gained by using both CPUs and GPUs hinges on effectively parallelizing the workload and avoiding bottlenecks. Data loading and preprocessing need to be optimized to ensure the GPU doesn’t stay idle waiting for data. In conclusion, leveraging both CPUs and GPUs can significantly speed up the training process of machine learning models by allowing for the efficient parallel processing of computations and data management. Understanding how to orchestrate the two can be crucial for optimizing training time and resource utilization."},{"prompt":"ayo","completion":"Hey there! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"tell me about quantum physics in simple terms","completion":"Sure, I'll simplify quantum physics as much as possible. At its core, quantum physics is the branch of physics that deals with the world of the very small—things like atoms and subatomic particles (like electrons, protons, and neutrons). What makes quantum physics distinct and fascinating is that the rules at this tiny scale are very different from the rules we see in our day-to-day lives. Here are a few key points that capture the essence of quantum physics: 1. **Quantum Superposition**: This principle suggests that particles can exist in multiple states or places at the same time until they are measured. Imagine it like a coin spinning in the air, being both heads and tails simultaneously until it lands (or is observed), and then it chooses one state. 2. **Quantum Entanglement**: This phenomenon occurs when particles become connected in such a way that the state of one (no matter how far away) instantly affects the state of the other. Albert Einstein famously referred to it as \\"spooky action at a distance.\\" It challenges our traditional notions of space and causality. 3. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Depending on how you observe them, particles like electrons can behave either as particles (showing properties like mass and charge) or as waves (exhibiting interference and diffraction). This duality is central to quantum mechanics and highlights the fact that the classical concepts of \\"particle\\" and \\"wave\\" are not adequate to describe the behavior of quantum objects. 4. **Uncertainty Principle**: Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to know with perfect accuracy both the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. This isn't due to technical limitations but is a fundamental property of nature. 5. **Quantum Tunneling**: This phenomenon allows particles to pass through barriers that, according to classical physics, should be impenetrable. This plays a crucial role in nuclear reactions and has practical applications in modern technology, such as in the making of semiconductors and tunnel diodes. Quantum physics has led to the development of numerous technological advancements, including computers, lasers, and medical imaging techniques amongst others. It challenges our classical ideas about how the universe works and opens up new fields of research and technology. In simple terms, quantum physics tells us that the universe at its most fundamental level is a strange and wonderful place, full of phenomena that defy our intuitive understanding of reality."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Although the state may be more open to some policies and less to others, it does not display this selectivity irrespective of the ways class forces pursue their policy preferences — the state does not display its selectivity irrespective of the strategies that class forces deploy. This implies that there is nothing prior to the ways in which the state impacts classes: that is, irrespective of how classes actually politically behave, the state cannot be said to have any structural bias in favour of, or against, certain classes. What indeed is a structural relation between the state and classes becomes a matter of strategic action of classes, that is, action mediated by the strategies of classes. It is easy to agree with Jessop that the state system will have differential impact on the capacity of class and class-relevant forces. But Jessop says that this is not because of the class nature of the state as such but because of ‘the relation between state structures and the strategies which different forces adopt towards it’ (Jessop, 2008: 36). The state ‘comprises an ensemble of centres that offer unequal chances to different forces, internal and external, to act for different political purposes’ (2016: 247). ‘State power is a complex social relation that reflects the changing balance of social forces in a determinate conjuncture\\" (ibid.; italics added). So the inherently class nature of the state is under-stressed. To the extent that the class nature is discussed, it is more a matter of quantity rather than essential quality. Consider the following statement, for example: the state ‘does differentially advance the ideal or the material interests of capital (or both) by comparison to the exercise of powers by other classes and social forces’ (Jessop, 2016: 97; italics added). The state is just more pro-capitalist and less pro-workers. The vocabulary of Jessop’s work is dominated by such class-neutral terms as ‘the state as a complex institutional ensemble’, ‘a site of political practices’, ‘various institutions’, ‘capacities’, ‘ensemble’, ‘agency’, ‘projects’, ‘subjects’, ‘strategies’, ‘selectivity’, ‘subsystem’, ‘ecological dominance’, ‘structuration of social relations’, ‘social power’, and so on (Jessop, 2016: 246—8). He does not mention class, socialism/communism, Lenin, and the like, even once in the section ‘Whither state theory’ in a recent book of his (Jessop, 2016: 246—9). Consider Jessop’s general definition/characterization of the state: [T]he state can be defined as a relatively unified ensemble of socially embedded, socially regularized, and strategically selective, institutions, organizations, social forces and activities organized around (or at least involved in) making collectively binding decisions for an imaginary political community. (Jessop, 2002: 40) There is nothing about class here. This neglect of class is also clear when he says that the state is a ‘distinct ensemble of institutions and organizations whose socially accepted function is to define and enforce collectively binding decisions on the members of a society in the name of their common interest or general will’ (Jessop, 1990: 341) in a context of class domination. So the state has no essential class character. It just happens to operate in a class context. This is consistent with his claim that state theorizing is just a specific instance of examination of the relation between structure and strategic action (Jessop, 2016: 249). Under-conceptualization of class struggle While there is some existing discussion on how class struggle affects state policies, this relation is under-conceptualized. It does not adequately appreciate the fact that economic and political concessions from the state — especially those that are significant and are, more or less, durable — are less because of the struggle for these concessions as such and more because they are the by-products of revolutionary struggle, and that this revolutionary struggle — struggle against the capitalist rules of the game — is exactly something that the state necessarily suppresses. Over-emphasis on capitalist class fractions in the work of such writers as Poulantzas leads to an under-emphasis on class struggle between capital and labour at the level of the state. Indeed, Poulantzas writes, The contradictions . . . reflected within the state are those among the dominant classes and fractions and between these and their supporting clsses, far more than the contradictions between the power bloc and the working class. The latter are basically expressed in the bourgeois state at a distance. (in Clarke, 1978: 47—8) Also, Poulantzas’ structuralism colours his view of class struggle, in the sense that class struggle is seen as constrained by, and confined within, the structure. As a result there is little indication that class struggle can also influence the structure that constrains it (Holloway, 1991: 97; Wright, 1978: 21). For Poulantzas and those who follow him (e.g. Jessop, Thomas, and many others), state power is to be understood as the condensation of, or form taken by, class struggles that vary historically and spatially. The state is the factor of cohesion and equilibrium of a social formation. This view is very close to the view that the state really is able to reconcile the opposed classes, even if in a contradictory manner. This is fundamentally anti-Marxist because in Marxism, the state arises precisely because reconciliation between the basic classes is not possible (see more on this in the following). Unlike Poulantzas and other structuralists, Clarke does not think that class and state as structures are permanent. Rather they are subject to, and reproduced through, class struggle. While Clarke stresses class struggle, the emphasis on political economy of capitalist production — what he calls the abstract analysis of capitalist — suffers from a relative neglect, however. The class struggle approach from Clarke and others tends to under-stress the role of the state in ensuring accumulation. Lebowitz (2009: 335—6) says that as workers accept capitalism as natural, this fact allows the state to guarantee the reproduction of capital. In other words, the balance of power — class politics, and not the class character of the state itself — is a reason why the state works on behalf of capital. Lebowitz argues that the struggle to make the state an agency of workers must be continuous. This process will change the workers into a political agency and will change their conditions. ‘We cannot be indifferent to the form of the state as an agency of workers’ (p. 336: italics added).21 Many theorists fruitfully emphasize the influence of class struggle on the state. But it is not enough that Marxist state theorists recognize the relation between the state and class struggle. (Some non-Marxists do that as well.) As Lenin (1949: 11) says in The state and revolution, ‘the bourgeois, and particularly the petty- bourgeois, ideologists, [are] compelled under the weight of indisputable historical facts to admit that the state only exists where there are class antagonisms and a class struggle’. But then they dilute the class character of the state which prompts Lenin to assert: ‘From what the petty-bourgeois and philistine professors and publicists say, with quite frequent and benevolent references to Marx, it appears that the state does reconcile classes’ (ibid.; italics added). Much state theory, sadly, reflects Lenin’s (1949) characterization of the thinking about the state on the part of ‘the petty-bourgeois and philistine professors and publicists’. The fact that the state is an organ of class rule is sought to be more explicitly refuted by many. For example, Bratsis (2002: 252) says that the Leninist approach is guilty of viewing the state as a unified subject because of its assumption that ‘the individuals who “control” the state share a class consciousness without explaining how this may happen and what conditions are necessary for this process to be successful’. So the objective class character of the state is mistakenly assumed to depend on the nature of consciousness of those who manage the affairs of the state. Reformism In terms of political implications, the existing state theories appear to be different but they have much common ground: taken as a totality, they are more reformist — or reform-oriented — than not. Intellectual over-emphasis on the autonomy of the state is associated with an under-emphasis on the revolutionary approach to the state, that is, with political reformism. There is a mistaken attempt on the part of some to treat existing theories as being (consistent with) the revolutionary Marxism of Lenin and Luxemburg.22 According to Poulantzas, because the state has a degree of autonomy and is not an instrument of the capitalist class, as Ellner (2017) notes, it can be used for the working class on the basis of its tactical (not necessarily strategic) alliance with other elements (e.g. ‘socialistic’ elements that are inclined towards the reform of the system but not its elimination, including even parties such as the US Democratic party). This view is far from Marx’s call to overthrow capitalism. As Ellner argues, if, as per the later writings of Poulantzas, the relatively autonomous state is not a tool in the hands of the capitalists and if it is a terrain of struggle, then this means that it is possible to have not only tactical alliance but also strategic alliance between the proletarians and the reformist elements (better-paid educated workers and even sections of the capitalist class). Such a view also rejects the big day — ruptural revolutionary idea — scenario where the working class seizes power. Thomas (2002: 76) notes, Poulantzas’ State, Power, Socialism is much more Gramscian than orthodox Leninist. In it ‘Poulantzas tells us that class struggle should aim not at capturing the state apparatus from without, but rather at transforming it from within’, a stance for which Thomas praises Poulantzas. Thomas (2002: 77) adds that according to Poulantzas, who settled accounts with some of his past Leninist views, ‘a successful democratic transition to socialism . . . would have to be more flexible than the axiomatic and legendary Leninist coup d’état’. In other words, ‘[i]t would instead have to involve at one and the same time coordination of action within the state, action to transform the state, and action at a distance from the state’. ”翻译为中文","completion":"杰索普强调了国家对“与阶级相关”的力量追求其利益能力的差异化影响。虽然国家对某些政策可能更开放，对另一些则不那么开放，但它显示出的选择性并不是不考虑阶级力量追求其政策偏好的方式——国家显示出的选择性并不是不考虑阶级力量部署的策略。这意味着，在国家影响阶级的方式之前，没有什么是既成的：也就是说，不管阶级在政治上如何实际行动，国家都不能说有任何结构上的偏见，无论是支持还是反对某些阶级。确实存在国家与阶级之间的结构关系成为了阶级策略行动的问题，即通过阶级策略的调解行动。 很容易同意杰索普的观点，即国家制度将对阶级及与阶级相关的力量的能力产生差异化的影响。但杰索普表示，这并不是因为国家本身的阶级性质，而是因为“国家结构与不同力量采取的策略之间的关系”（杰索普，2008年：36）。国家“包括一个提供不同力量，无论是内部还是外部的，为不同政治目的行动的不平等机会中心的集合”（2016年：247）。 “国家权力是一种复杂的社会关系，反映了在特定结局中社会力量变化的平衡”（同上；斜体加重）。因此，对国家的本质阶级性质强调不足。在讨论阶级性质的程度上，这更多是数量问题而非本质质量问题。例如，考虑以下声明：国家“通过与其他阶级和社会力量行使权力的比较，不同程度地推进资本的理想或物质利益（或两者）”（杰索普，2016年：97；斜体加重）。国家只是更亲资本家，而不是更亲工人。 杰索普的工作词汇中充斥着这样的阶级中性术语，如“国家作为一个复杂的机构集合”，“政治实践的场所”，“各种机构”，“能力”，“集合”，“主体”，“项目”，“主体”，“策略”，“选择性”，“子系统”，“生态支配”，“社会关系的结构化”，“社会权力”等（杰索普，2016年：246—8）。在他最近一本名为《国家理论何去何从》（2016年：246—9）的书的“国家理论何去何从”一节中，他甚至一次也没有提到阶级、社会主义/共产主义、列宁等。 考虑杰索普对国家的一般定义/特征描述： [国家可以定义为一个相对统一的集合，它包括社会内嵌、社会规范化、策略选择性强的机构、组织、社会力量和活动，这些都是围绕着（至少是参与到）为一个想象的政治共同体制定集体约束性决策而组织的。 （杰索普，2002年：40） 这里没有提到阶级。当他说国家是一个“明确的机构和组织集合，其社会接受的功能是代表他们的共同利益或总体意志，为社会成员定义和执行集体约束性决定”（杰索普，1990年：341）时，这种忽视阶级在阶级统治背景下也很明显。所以国家没有本质的阶级特征。它只不过是在阶级背景下运作。这与他的说法相一致，即国家理论化只是检查结构与策略行动之间关系的一个具体例子（杰索普，2016年：249）。 阶级斗争的概念化不足 尽管存在一些关于阶级斗争如何影响国家政策的讨论，但这种关系概念化不足。它没有充分认识到经济和政治让步从国家获得的事实——尤其是那些显著且或多或少持久的让步——更少是因为这些让步的斗争本身，更多是因为它们是革命斗争的副产品，而这种革命斗争——反对资本主义游戏规则的斗争——正是国家必然要压制的。 Poulantzas等人对资本家阶级分裂的过分强调导致了在国家层面对资本与劳动之间的阶级斗争的弱化。的确，Poulantzas写道， 反映在国家内部的矛盾是那些主导阶级和阶级分裂以及这些与他们的支持阶级之间的矛盾，远非权力集团与工人阶级之间的矛盾。后者基本上是在资产阶级国家中被置于距离之外表达的。（引自Clarke，1978年：47—8） 此外，Poulantzas的结构主义观点色彩了他对阶级斗争的看法，从某种意义上说，阶级斗争被视为受到结构的约束和限制。结果，几乎没有迹象表明阶级斗争也可以影响约束它的结构（Holloway，1991年：97；Wright，1978年：21）。 对于Poulantzas和其他人来说（例如杰索普、托马斯和许多其他人），国家权力被理解为阶级斗争的凝结，或者是阶级斗争采取的形式，这种斗争在历史和空间上是多变的。国家是社会形态的凝聚和平衡因素。这一观点非常接近于国家确实能够以矛盾的方式调和对立的阶级的观点。这在根本上是反马克思主义的，因为在马克思主义中，国家的产生正是因为基本阶级之间的和解是不可能的（在接下来的内容中将进一步讨论这一点）。 与Poulantzas和其他结构主义者不同的是，克拉克认为阶级和国家作为结构并不是永久的。相反，它们是通过阶级斗争受到制约和再生产的。虽然克拉克强调了阶级斗争，但他所谓的资本主义生产的政治经济学——他称之为对资本主义的抽象分析——却相对被忽视了。克拉克和其他人的阶级斗争方法倾向于弱化国家在确保积累中的作用。 莱博维茨（Lebowitz，2009年：335-6）说，由于工人接受资本主义是自然的，这个事实使得国家能够保证资本的再生产。换句话说，权力平衡——阶级政治，而不是国家本身的阶级特征——是国家代表资本工作的原因。莱博维茨认为，让国家成为工人代理的斗争必须是持续的。这一过程将改变工人成为一个政治代理，并将改变他们的条件。 “我们不能对国家作为工人代理的形式漠不关心”（第336页：斜体加重）。 许多理论家有益地强调了阶级斗争对国家的影响。但仅仅认识到国家与阶级斗争之间的关系是不够的。（一些非马克思主义者也做到了这一点。）正如列宁（1949年：11）在《国家与革命》中所说，“资产阶级，特别是小资产阶级的意识形态家们，在不可否认的历史事实的重压下被迫承认，只有在存在阶级对立和阶级斗争的地方才存在国家”。但随后他们稀释了国家的阶级特征，这促使列宁断言：“从那些小资产阶级和庸俗教授和公共人物说的话中，可以看出，他们在频繁而和善地提到马克思的同时，似乎认为国家确实调和了阶级”（同上；斜体加重）。遗憾的是，很多国家理论反映了列宁（1949年）对“小资产阶级和庸俗教授和公共人物”对国家思考的特征。 许多人试图更明确地反驳国家是阶级统治工具的事实。例如，Bratsis（2002年：252）说，列宁主义方法因其假设“控制”国家的个体共享一种阶级意识而没有解释这如何发生以及这个过程成功所需的条件，因而被指控将国家视为一个统一主体。因此，错误地假设国家的客观阶级特征取决于那些管理国家事务的人的意识性质。 改良主义 在政治含义上，现有的国家理论看似不同，但它们有很多共同点：总体上，它们更倾向于改良主义——或说是改良导向——而不是其他。对国家自主性的过分强调与对国家革命方法的弱化——即政治改良主义——有关。有人错误地试图将现有理论视为与列宁和卢森堡的革命马克思主义相一致。 根据Poulantzas的说法，因为国家有一定程度的自主性，不是资本家阶级的工具，正如Ellner（2017）所指出的，它可以基于与其他元素（例如倾向于改革体制而非消除体制的“社会主义”元素，甚至包括像美国民主党这样的党派）的战术性（不一定是战略性）联盟，为工人阶级服务。这种观点与马克思号召推翻资本主义相去甚远。正如Ellner所争论的，如果按照Poulantzas后期的著作，相对自主的国家不是资本家手中的工具，如果它是斗争的领域，那么这意味着不仅可以在无产者和改良主义元素（更高薪的受过教育的工人甚至资本家阶级的部分）之间建立不仅仅是战术联盟而且是战略联盟。这种观点也拒绝了那种工人阶级夺取权力的大日子——突变革命想法——的场景。 托马斯（Thomas，2002年：76）指出，Poulantzas的《国家、权力、社会主义》比正统列宁主义更接近格拉姆西。在其中“Poulantzas告诉我们，阶级斗争的目标不应该是从外部夺取国家机构，而应该是从内部转变它”，托马斯为Poulantzas的这一立场表示赞赏。托马斯（2002年：77）补充说，根据Poulantzas，他与自己过去的一些列宁主义观点决裂， “成功地民主过渡到社会主义......将不得不比公式化和传奇色彩的列宁主义政变更加灵活”。换句话说，“它将不得不同时涉及国家内部的行动协调、转变国家的行动，以及与国家保持距离的行动”。"},{"prompt":"请将“Poulantzas has stressed ‘the need to preserve and extend the institutions and values of representative democracy alongside, though not at the expense of, direct rank-and-file democracy in the transition to socialism’ (Thomas, 2002: 77).23 According to Thomas (2002: 78), ‘Poulantzas was stimulated . . . to complete his trajectory from Leninist vanguardism to a distinctively left-Eurocommunist position under the impulse and impetus provided by his very own analyses of contemporary authoritarian regimes’. Thomas (2002: 74) praises what he calls Poulantzas’ ‘principled denial of the continuing validity of the Leninist “dual power” strategy of building up a counterstate outside the capitalist state’, and he also praises Poulantzas’ logic of the denial: that strategy ‘had done nobody any good in Greece or Portugal, and that, in any case, the capitalist state had, by the late 1960s or early 1970s, undergone significant, and presumably irreversible, changes since Lenin’s time’. The upshot of all this is that institutions of the state, including those that claim to be representative, do not have a necessary class character, and these can be modified to suit the interests of the masses. It is true that the instrumentalist theory can have a politically progressive implication: to the extent that the state functions the way that instrumentalism describes, such a view helps demystify the liberal view of a class-neutral state (Oilman, 1982). Instrumentalists, with a revolutionary tendency, believe that state policies in the real interest of the majority can happen only after revolution, so they rule out the possibility of workers’ organizations being in an alliance with others (e.g. moderate social democratic parties) managing the state (Ellner, 2017: 34). Since the state does not have much autonomy, leftist governments might not be able to do much for the masses. However, if the capitalist character of the state is because of the nature of state actors (personnel) and that the state is capitalist in the sense that state actors share capitalist views and are linked to (or are themselves) capitalists, then it follows that if the personnel are working-class people, the state can serve working-class interests. This is the objective implication of the instrumentalist irrespective of the specific subjective intentions of writers such as Miliband. Indeed, Miliband was not opposed to the strategy of working within the state, and he thought that at the local scale, middle-class elected officials of the left can do much for the working class (Ellner, 2017). According to Heinrich (2004: 202), ‘[the] instrumentalist conception of the state usually leads to the demand for an alternative use of the state’. In this conception, the idea that the state can contribute to welfare of everyone ‘should finally be taken seriously and the interests of other classes more strongly taken into consideration’ (ibid.). Some instrumentalists (e.g. those with reformist tendencies) ‘believe that under capitalist relations a different politics . . . is possible’ and that ‘ “better” policies are expected from the participation of leftists parties in government’ (Heinrich, 2004: 202). When such a government disappoints the workers, instrumentalists believe that that is an unnecessary cost of compromise or because of the betrayal of the leaders of leftist parties (Ellner, 2017). Over time, Miliband’s and Poulantzas’ ideas about the state showed convergence in terms of instrumentalism and structuralism or in relation to the topic of state autonomy. And Miliband, like Poulantzas, was critical of Lenin’s state theory, including his idea about the need for smashing the bourgeois state and establishment of a proletarian state under the democratic control of the proletarians. Panitch (2002: 103—4) rightly believes that ‘[t]he point of radical theory . . . is to effect real political change’ and that the state theory which was developed since the late 1960s has had a specific political implication. But the question is, what kind of implication? Panitch argues for fundamentally changing the old social-democratic or Communist parties, or, more likely, building new ones concerned with and capable of not just entering the state, but transforming its structures, linkages with civil society, and relations with other states. In these lines, Panitch describes his own approach towards what is to be done — an approach which, in terms of its objective effects on politics, is, at best, a ‘left-social-democratic’ approach. Indeed, Panitch, who is rightly critical of the state autonomist theory for its reformism,24 says that ‘[w]e need to reappropriate the concept of structural reforms from the IMF’s agenda. . . [and we need to see these as the] reforms which do not just ameliorate capitalist conditions but build cumulatively towards overcoming those conditions’ (Panitch and Gindin, 2015: 19). As the quantity of reform obtained by common people through their struggles increases, a time will come when the state will be qualitatively changed, so there is no need for any revolutionary approach. Gradualism will do. It is as if there is nothing about the capitalist state that will stop this from happening. Panitch believes that it is possible, under capitalism, to build public institutions ‘to allow for the diverse capacities and expressions of humanity to be nurtured. This must become a central strategic concern of socialists, which the old notion of “dual power” and the new one of “changing the world without taking power” both completely avoid’ (ibid.). Panitch stresses ‘the importance of making the public goods and services required to meet workers’ collective needs the central objective of class struggle’ (p. 17). Panitch continues: Indeed we must be mindful of whether even national let alone local or sectoral campaigns for higher incomes translate effectively into class struggles, insofar as such campaigns may emphasise competition among workers for greater access to individualised consumption. (p. 21; italics added)25 Such a view has two implications. One is that workers’ economic daily struggle against capitalists is under-emphasized. Another is that it can directly negate Lenin’s and Marx’s theory of the state: ‘The worn-out concepts of the smashing of the state and the withering away of the state do not begin to capture this’ (i.e. his approach) (p. 19). This approach is miles away from Lenin’s and Marx’s view on the state. This is the kind of approach that belonged to the ‘indifferentists’ whom Marx (1873) mocked at using their voice: [I]f the workers replace the dictatorship of the bourgeois class with their own revolutionary dictatorship, then they are guilty of the terrible crime of lèse-principe. . . . Workers must not even form single unions for every trade, for by so doing they perpetuate the social division of labour as they find it in bourgeois society; this division, which fragments the working class, is the true basis of their present enslavement. One can agree with Panitch that the working class does need its own institutions. But these are not the type that the Lenin legacy argues for (e.g. councils of workers as proto-state organizations; democratically organized disciplined parties with a high level of theoretical, political, and historical consciousness). The types of parties that can transform working classes into leading agents of social transformation have yet to be invented. Recognising this will finally free us from the moorings of either 1917 or 1945 that have so badly tethered previous attempts at party-building or renewal. (Panitch and Gindin, 2015: 20) Panitch seems to want to go beyond both revolutionary Marxism of Lenin and commonly prevalent social democratic ideas. For him, ‘[t]he goal is not to turn the state into a working-class instrument but to transform public institutions so that they are oriented to acting on behalf of all humanity in a democratic socialist system’ (p. 18—9).26 Consider a former student of Leo Panitch, Stephen Maher, a supporter of democratic socialism. Writing for a recent symposium on state theory in a Marxist journal, he says: ‘The contemporary democratic socialist revival should be understood as an opportunity for transforming the state’ through ‘electoral campaigns and extra-institutional workplace struggles and social movements’ (Maher and Khachaturian, 2021: 192). Like many others’, Maher’s approach to Lenin implies the following: what happened empirically, that is, in a given historical context and within the geographical boundary of Russia (i.e. the failure of 1917 revolution to establish socialism), can be employed to critique Lenin’s theory as such. This is clear when Maher says: ‘This history [Russia’s post-1917 history] is often blurred by [Leninists’] calls for smashing the state today’ (p. 194). Scholars like Maher, of course, recognize that ‘[t]he state is inherently structured to reproduce capitalism’ (so class relations impact the state), but, that is only a half-truth to them, for the state ‘also presents opportunities for democratic movements to counter-organize within and across its institutions’ and, as Poulantzas had argued, ‘it provides a terrain on which working-class demands can be formed, contested, and possibly implemented’ (p. 194). The state can be democratized ‘so that it governs differently’ (p. 196), and this will open up opportunities for a democratically run economy: ‘The struggle to transform the state is indispensable for democratizing the economy’ (p. 197). Without overthrowing capitalism, the capitalist state and the capitalist economy can be slowly democratized through socialist strategies. These strategies include things like the new green deal (state investment in new green technologies, and the like) and nationalization of banks, development of ‘public, participatory institutions for the democratic planning of investment’, and so on. In part influenced by his mentor (Panitch), Maher argues: Waging a struggle within and against the state would require building new forms of participation and working-class organization, all aiming for even-tually breaking with capitalist social relations. Yet if the latter is to take place, it will be neither through a single rupture with the existing order, nor a smooth evolution. (p. 197)”翻译为中文","completion":"波兰察斯强调了“在向社会主义过渡的过程中，需要保留和扩展代表性民主的机构和价值观，尽管不是以直接的基层民主为代价”（托马斯，2002年：77）。根据托马斯（2002年：78）的说法，“波兰察斯受到了他自己对当代威权主义政权分析的启发和推动，完成了他从列宁主义先锋主义到一个特定的左翼欧洲共产主义立场的轨迹”。托马斯（2002年：74）赞扬了他所谓的波兰察斯对列宁主义“双重权力”策略持续有效性的原则性否认，即在资本主义国家之外构建一个对立国家的策略，他还赞扬了波兰察斯的否认逻辑：这一策略“在希腊或葡萄牙对任何人都没有好处，而且，无论如何，到了20世纪60年代末或70年代初，资本主义国家已经经历了重大，推定不可逆转的变化，自列宁时代以来”。 所有这些的结果是，国家的机构，包括那些声称代表性的机构，不必然具有阶级性质，这些机构可以被修改以适应大众的利益。的确，工具主义理论可以具有政治上的进步含义：在国家以工具主义所描述的方式运作的程度上，这种观点有助于揭示自由派关于阶级中立国家的观点（奥尔曼，1982）。具有革命倾向的工具主义者认为，只有在革命之后，国家政策才能真正符合多数人的实际利益，因此他们排除了工人组织与其他组织（例如，温和的社会民主党）结盟管理国家的可能性（埃尔纳，2017年：34）。由于国家没有太多的自主性，左翼政府可能无法为大众做太多事情。然而，如果国家的资本主义特征是由于国家行为者（人员）的性质，即国家是资本主义的，因为国家行为者持有资本主义观点并与（或本身是）资本家有联系，那么就可以得出结论，如果人员是工人阶级，国家可以为工人阶级的利益服务。这是工具主义的客观含义，无论像米利班德这样的作家的具体主观意图如何。 的确，米利班德并不反对在国家内部策略，并且他认为在地方层面，左翼的中产阶级民选官员可以为工人阶级做很多事情（埃尔纳，2017年）。根据海因里希（2004年：202）的说法，“工具主义对国家的概念通常会导致对国家另类使用的要求”。在这种概念中，关于国家可以为每个人的福祉做出贡献的想法“应该被认真对待，更强烈地考虑其他阶级的利益”（同上）。一些工具主义者（例如，那些具有改良主义倾向的人）“相信在资本主义条件下可能存在不同的政治......并且期待从左翼党派参与政府中获得‘更好’的政策”（海因里希，2004年：202）。当这样的政府让工人失望时，工具主义者认为这是妥协的不必要代价或是因为左翼党派领导人的背叛（埃尔纳，2017年）。随着时间的推移，米利班德和波兰察斯关于国家的想法在工具主义和结构主义或关于国家自治的主题上显示出了融合。米利班德，像波兰察斯一样，批评了列宁的国家理论，包括他关于摧毁资产阶级国家和建立在无产阶级民主控制下的无产阶级国家的需要。 潘尼奇（2002年：103-4）正确地认为，“激进理论的重点......是为了实现真正的政治变革”，并且自20世纪60年代末以来发展的国家理论具有特定的政治含义。但问题是，这种含义是什么？潘尼奇主张 根本改变旧的社会民主党或共产党，或者更有可能，建立新的党派，这些党派关注并且有能力不仅仅是进入国家，而是改变其结构、与民间社会的联系以及与其他国家的关系。 在这些行文中，潘尼奇描述了他自己对应该做什么的看法——就其对政治的客观影响而言，充其量是一种“左翼社会民主主义”的方法。 的确，潘尼奇，他对国家自治理论的改良主义持批评态度，说“我们需要从国际货币基金组织的议程中重新占有结构性改革的概念......[我们需要看到这些作为]不仅仅是缓解资本主义条件的改革，而是构建逐步克服这些条件的改革”（潘尼奇和金丁，2015年：19）。随着普通人通过他们的斗争获得的改革数量的增加，国家将会发生质的改变，因此没有必要采取任何革命性方法。渐进主义就足够了。就好像资本主义国家没有任何阻止这种情况发生的事情。潘尼奇认为，在资本主义下，有可能建立公共机构“以培养人类的多样化能力和表达。这必须成为社会主义者的中心战略关切，而旧的‘双重权力’概念和新的‘不夺取权力改变世界’概念都完全避开了这一点”（同上）。潘尼奇强调“使满足工人集体需求的公共商品和服务成为阶级斗争的中心目标的重要性”（第17页）。潘尼奇继续说： 的确，我们必须警惕，即使是全国性的，更不用说地方性或行业性的，为了更高收入的运动是否有效地转化为阶级斗争，因为这样的运动可能强调工人之间为了获得个体化消费的更大机会而进行的竞争。 （第21页；斜体加重）这种观点有两个含义。一个是工人与资本家的日常经济斗争被弱化了。另一个是它可以直接否定列宁和马克思的国家理论：“对国家的粉碎和国家的消亡这些陈旧的概念根本无法捕捉到这一点”（即他的方法）（第19页）。这种方法与列宁和马克思关于国家的观点相距甚远。这是属于马克思（1873年）所嘲讽的“冷漠主义者”的那种方法： 如果工人以自己的革命独裁取代了资产阶级阶级的独裁，那么他们就犯下了可怕的重罪......工人甚至不应该为每个行业形成单一的工会，因为这样做他们就会在资产阶级社会中保持社会劳动分工；这种分工，它使工人阶级碎片化，是他们当前奴役的真正基础。 可以同意潘尼奇的观点，工人阶级确实需要自己的机构。但这些不是列宁遗产所主张的那种类型（例如，作为原型国家组织的工人委员会；具有高度理论、政治和历史意识的民主组织的党）。 能将工人阶级转变为社会转型的领导力量的党的类型尚未被发明。承认这一点最终将使我们摆脱1917年或1945年的拘泥，这些年份严重地束缚了先前对党的建设或更新的尝试。 （潘尼奇和金丁，2015年：20） 潘尼奇似乎想超越列宁的革命马克思主义和普遍存在的社会民主主义思想。对他来说，“目标不是将国家变成工人阶级的工具，而是改造公共机构，使其面向代表全人类的民主社会主义体系”（第18-9页）。 考虑一位列奥·潘尼奇的前学生，斯蒂芬·马赫尔，一位民主社会主义的支持者。在最近一次关于国家理论的马克思主义期刊研讨会上，他写道：“当代民主社会主义的复兴应该被理解为一次转变国家的机会”，通过“选举运动和体制外的工作场所斗争及社会运动”（马赫尔和卡查图里安，2021年：192）。像许多其他人一样，马赫尔对列宁的态度意味着以下内容：从实证上看，即在特定的历史背景和俄罗斯的地理边界内（即1917年革命未能建立社会主义）的情况，可以用来批判列宁理论本身。当马赫尔说：“这段历史[俄罗斯后1917年的历史]经常被[列宁主义者]今天对国家粉碎的呼吁所模糊”时，这一点很明显（第194页）。 像马赫尔这样的学者当然认识到“国家本质上是为了再生产资本主义”（所以阶级关系影响国家），但是，对他们来说，这只是半个真理，因为国家“也为民主运动提供了在其机构内部和跨机构内部反组织的机会”，正如波兰察斯所争论的，“它提供了一个场地，工人阶级的要求可以在这里形成、争论和可能实施”（第194页）。国家可以被民主化，“以便它以不同的方式治理”（第196页），这将为民主经济开辟机会：“改造国家的斗争对于民主化经济至关重要”（第197页）。通过社会主义策略，可以逐步民主化资本主义国家和资本主义经济，而无需推翻资本主义。这些策略包括类似新绿色协议（国家对新绿色技术的投资等）和对银行的国有化，“公共、参与性机构的发展，用于民主规划投资”等。部分受到他的导师（潘尼奇）的影响，马赫尔认为： 在国家内部和反对国家的斗争中，需要建立新形式的参与和工人阶级组织，所有这些都旨在最终打破资本主义的社会关系。然而，如果后者要发生，那将既不是通过与现有秩序的单一突破，也不是通过平滑进化。 （第197页）"},{"prompt":"请将“It is recognized that there are limits to what can be done by the state, but ‘[w]ithin certain limits’, the capitalist state, given its contradictions, can ‘serve as a terrain of struggle’ (p. 195). It is one thing to say that the state can be a terrain of struggle for reforms. But this claim cannot be conflated with the claim that the capitalist state will wither away and be transformed into a socialist state, through the struggle for reforms. Scholars like Maher do not ask: how can the limits be breached, and what happens when the limits are (close to being) breached? That there are limits to what the state can do is recognized, and the need to break with capitalism is broached, by democratic-socialist state theorists, but such discursive intervention is more rhetorical than real: they go on as if there are no limits. Consider David Harvey (2019), who has recently said that capitalism is too big to fail (more on this later), which means that the state can be used to significantly improve the conditions of the masses by putting pressure on capitalists. About the state, Harvey (2008a: 20) further says: Merchant capital went outside of the constraints of feudal power in its explorations and exploitation of the world market. In effect this was a geographical strategy that gained power from outside of the bastions of feudalism and then, having surrounded the latter, forced them to surrender to bourgeois power. The state that protected feudal interests was captured and transformed and put to bourgeois uses (is the US state as currently constituted anything other than an executive committee for the protection of corporate interests?). Harvey draws a political lesson from the aforementioned discussion that the capitalist class can be captured and transformed by the working class (gradually) in its own economic interest, even at the local scales: While socialism in one country (let alone city) may be impossible, this does not mean that the territoriali-sation of political struggle, the occupation of this or that city, region or nation state as a staging ground for broader assaults upon the political power of capitalist elites, is irrelevant. (ibid.) In other words, if, in capitalism, the bourgeoisie uses the state, why not the working class? Or if, in a feudal society, capitalists gradually gained state power, then in capitalist society, why can the working class not gradually gain economic power? That the bourgeois revolution and socialist revolution are different in their fundamental class content is blurred. That the working class must, unlike the bourgeoisie, achieve state power first is, more or less, thrown to the wind. Underlying this mistaken view of social change is a mistaken theory of the state. The practical implication of the state autonomy approach, including the developmental state thinking, is also reformist. It imputes far too much power to the state apparatuses to promote development in the global periphery. In short, the objective effect of the ideas of the stalwarts of state theory — Miliband, Poulantzas, and many others and those who have been influenced by them — is reformism. Miliband’s left social democracy (left of labour) and Poulantzas’s euro-communism27 are not dissimilar to the ideas that are ‘popular among the proponents of the pink tide in Latin America in the 2000s, or among leading thinkers and supporters of Syriza in Greece’ and elsewhere (Barker, 2019). And their ideas were very similar to those of more recent academic Marxists such as Harvey, Wright, Panitch, Block, and so on, who have written about the state. Direct proletarian assault on the state to replace it is not on their agenda. Broadly, their ideas are Kautsky-ite: the state should not be smashed but changed from within through constant struggle for permanent, or uninterrupted, reforms. One reason why I have discussed the reformist character of much state theory is that the reformist views are a window to the nature of the explanatory views about the state. Of course, one could say that a theorist’s explanatory analysis of the state is correct, but their views on what is to be done about the state may be reformist. This may be true within limits. I am more inclined to think that if the views of a theorist about what is to be done with the state are reformist, then their underlying views about how to explain the state are likely to be inadequate: If it is possible to place a given person’s general type of thought on the basis of his relation to concrete practical problems, it is also possible to predict approximately, knowing his general type of thought, how a given individual will approach one or another practical question. That is the incomparable educational value of the dialectical method of thought. (Trotsky, 1973: 431-2) Therefore, a necessary task of Marxist state theory should be to expose the futility of the philosophical and theoretical ideas behind the advocacy for ‘permanent’ reforms, including on the part of some who call themselves Marxists. I cannot help thinking that their wrong explanatory views of the state and society are behind their reformist political prescription concerning the state and society. 8 Conclusion Existing theoretical ideas have contributed to our understanding of the state in many ways. According to some, the state works on behalf of capitalists because capitalists and educated middle-class men and women, who share their ideology and support the particular or general interests of capitalists, occupy top unelected bureaucratic positions or gain seats in the parliament or otherwise influence the state. In other words, the capitalist class uses the state as an instrument, with the state lacking autonomy. Alternatively, because workers, separated from the means of production, do not have to be physically forced to work for a wage, a separate sphere of extra-economic coercion exists, which is the state, but the state uses its relative autonomy to defend political hegemony of capitalists, and to create general conditions for capitalist accumulation which the competing self-interested capitalists will not ensure or which they might indeed undermine. The state keeps working masses disorganized by giving concessions, and it keeps the different fractions of the capitalist class united. A part of this argument is institutional separation-ism: the idea that state is institutionally separate from capitalist economy and the state depends on taxes, so the state must do things to promote capitalist production and exchange without which its own material basis will be at risk. In another school of thought, what the state does reflects the balance of power between the basic classes outside the state and inside the state, within which opposed classes are present. For some, class struggle ultimately reproduces the state, and for others, class struggle for economic concessions can undermine the boundary between the economic and the political and therefore threaten state power itself (struggle against high rent becomes the struggle against the courts that protect the rent system itself). The state’s benefits for the masses are limited because of various general mechanisms. The state is controlled by the dominant class and used by it as an instrument, making it serve its own interests. This limits what the state can do for the masses. Alternatively, if the capitalist structure is such that the state is institutionally ‘separate’ from the sphere of capitalist accumulation (as mentioned earlier), the state, at least, in part, for its own survival, must promote capitalist accumulation. This in turn means that the state can only do limited things for the masses, except that by promoting capitalist accumulation, the state can indirectly benefit the masses by helping create jobs and suchlike. State actors have their own autonomous interests too, and to the extent that their interests coincide with the capitalists interests, the state does not fundamentally benefit the masses. These ideas do reveal important aspects of the state and are therefore useful. Some of these ideas are also more or less shared by Marx in Capital volume 1 or are consistent with Marx’s ideas about the state in that text. These ideas are, however, problematic in many ways. It is said that the state acts in the interests of capitalists because it is directly influenced by capitalists, but what is it about the state that allows capitalists to control the state? And why does it not allow socialists — or workers interested in a cooperative society — to control it? It is often said that the capitalist state cannot do this or that because the capitalist class constrains state’s actions as the state depends on taxes (for example, it is said that the state cannot tax capitalists because they will move elsewhere or will go on an investment strike). The constraints on the state do exist; it is true that the state is indebted or the state depends on taxes. But, to me, these constraints have a derivative existence — they do not define the essential nature of the state. The separation of the state from capitalist economy is more a matter of the surface reality of capitalism. The major problem is the fact that, and this might be hard to believe, the inherently class character of the capitalist state is under-emphasized in much existing theory, and that means that the limits to the extent to which state can provide concessions are under-conceptualized. This reproduces what Lenin calls ‘unreasoning trust’ in the capitalist state. The class character of the state and how exactly it functions (e.g. how autonomous it is) belong to different levels of analysis. They do not have the same causal importance in explaining what the state does. The first has primacy. And the degree of state’s autonomy is much less than assumed. The fact that commodities, including labour power, are exchanged freely and that no one can force a worker to work for a certain capitalist explains how the state works, but it does not, and cannot, explain the fact that in capitalism there is, and there will be, a state. That there is a state in capitalism is explained by the same fact that there is a state in pre-capitalism, and this is where the theoretical ideas from Marx/Engels and from the Lenin legacy about the state are useful.”翻译为中文","completion":"人们认识到国家能做什么是有限的，但“在一定限度内”，鉴于资本主义国家的矛盾，它可以“作为斗争的场域”（第195页）。说国家可以成为争取改革的斗争场域是一回事。但这种说法不能与通过争取改革，资本主义国家将逐渐消亡并转变为社会主义国家的说法相混淆。像马赫尔这样的学者没有问：如何突破限制，当限制（接近）被突破时将会发生什么？国家能做什么是有限制的这一点得到了认可，民主社会主义国家理论家提出了打破资本主义的需要，但这种话语干预更多是修辞而非现实：他们行事好像没有限制。 考虑大卫·哈维（2019年），他最近说资本主义太大而不能失败（稍后详述），这意味着国家可以通过向资本家施压显著改善大众的条件。哈维（2008a：20）进一步关于国家说： 商人资本在探索和利用世界市场时，超越了封建权力的约束。实际上，这是一种地理策略，它从封建主义的堡垒之外获得力量，然后，包围了封建主义势力，迫使它们向资产阶级权力投降。保护封建利益的国家被捕获、转变并投入资产阶级的使用（当前构成的美国国家还不只是一个保护企业利益的执行委员会吗？）。 哈维从上述讨论中得出一个政治教训，即资产阶级可以被工人阶级（逐渐）捕获并转变为自己的经济利益，即使是在地方层面： 虽然一个国家（更不用说一个城市）的社会主义可能是不可能的，但这并不意味着政治斗争的领土化、占领这个或那个城市、地区或民族国家作为对资本主义精英政治权力进行更广泛攻击的前哨站是无关紧要的。 （同上） 换句话说，如果在资本主义中，资产阶级使用国家，为什么工人阶级不能呢？或者，如果在封建社会中，资本家逐渐获得了国家权力，那么在资本主义社会中，工人阶级为什么不能逐渐获得经济权力？资产阶级革命和社会主义革命在它们的基本阶级内容上的不同被模糊了。工人阶级必须与资产阶级不同，首先获得国家权力的事实，或多或少地被忽视了。这种对社会变革的错误观点背后是国家理论的错误。包括发展国家思想在内的国家自主性方法的实际含义也是改良主义的。它过于强调国家机构促进全球边缘地区发展的能力。 简而言之，国家理论巨头的思想的客观效果——米利班德、波兰察斯以及许多其他人以及受他们影响的人——是改良主义。米利班德的左翼社会民主主义（劳工左翼）和波兰察斯的欧洲共产主义与2000年代拉丁美洲“粉红浪潮”的支持者或希腊Syriza的主要思想家和支持者以及其他地方的观点并无不同。他们的思想与像哈维、赖特、潘尼奇、布洛克等近来学术界的马克思主义者非常相似，这些人都写过关于国家的文章。直接的无产阶级对国家的攻击以替换它并不在他们的议程上。广泛来说，他们的思想是考茨基主义：国家不应该被粉碎，而应该通过不断斗争进行永久的、不间断的改革来从内部改变。 我之所以讨论许多国家理论的改良主义特征，是因为改良主义观点是解释关于国家的解释观点性质的一个窗口。当然，有人可能会说，一个理论家对国家的解释性分析是正确的，但他们对该如何处理国家的观点可能是改良主义的。在一定范围内，这可能是真的。我更倾向于认为，如果一个理论家关于该如何处理国家的观点是改良主义的，那么他们关于如何解释国家的基本观点很可能是不充分的： 如果可以根据一个人与具体实践问题的关系来确定这个人的思想的一般类型，那么也可以大致预测，知道他的思想的一般类型，一个人将如何处理一个或另一个实践问题。这是辩证思维方法的无与伦比的教育价值。 （托洛茨基，1973年：431-2） 因此，马克思主义国家理论的一个必要任务应该是揭露那些倡导“永久”改革的哲学和理论观点的徒劳，包括那些自称为马克思主义者的一部分人。我不禁认为，他们对国家和社会的错误解释观点是他们关于国家和社会的改良主义政治处方背后的原因。 8 结论 现有的理论观点在许多方面有助于我们理解国家。根据一些人的观点，国家代表资本家工作，因为资本家和受过教育的中产阶级男女，他们分享他们的意识形态并支持资本家的特定或一般利益，占据了顶级未经选举的官僚职位或获得了议会席位或以其他方式影响国家。换句话说，资产阶级阶级使用国家作为工具，国家缺乏自主性。或者因为，工人与生产资料分离，不必被物理强迫为工资工作，在国家之外存在一个非经济的强制领域，但国家使用其相对自主性来捍卫资本家的政治霸权，并创造资本主义积累的一般条件，这些是相互竞争的自私的资本家不会确保或可能确实破坏的。国家通过给予让步使工作大众保持分散，使资本家阶级不同派别团结起来。这个论点的一部分是机构分离主义：国家在机构上与资本主义经济分离，国家依赖税收，所以国家必须促进资本主义生产和交换，否则其自身的物质基础将面临风险。 在另一种学派的思想中，国家所做的反映了国家内外基本阶级之间的权力平衡，其中存在对立的阶级。对一些人来说，阶级斗争最终再生产了国家，对另一些人来说，为经济让步而进行的阶级斗争可以破坏经济与政治之间的界限，因此威胁到国家权力本身（反对高租金的斗争成为反对保护租金体系本身的法院的斗争）。 由于各种一般机制，国家对大众的好处是有限的。国家受到主导阶级的控制并被用作工具，使其服务于自身利益。这限制了国家能为大众做什么。或者，如果资本主义结构是这样的，即国家在机构上“与资本主义积累领域分离”（如前所述），至少部分地，为了自身的生存，国家必须促进资本主义积累。这反过来意味着国家只能为大众做有限的事情，除非通过促进资本主义积累，国家可以间接地通过帮助创造就业机会等为大众带来好处。国家行为者也有他们自己的自主利益，只要他们的利益与资本家的利益一致，国家就不会根本上使大众受益。 这些观点揭示了国家的重要方面，因此是有用的。马克思在《资本论》第一卷中也或多或少地分享了一些这些观点，或者与马克思关于国家的观点一致。然而，这些观点在许多方面是有问题的。据说国家代表资本家的利益行事，是因为它受到资本家的直接影响，但什么使得资本家能够控制国家？为什么它不允许社会主义者——或对合作社会感兴趣的工人——控制它？人们常说，资本主义国家不能做这个或那个，因为资本家阶级限制了国家的行动，因为国家依赖税收（例如，据说国家不能对资本家征税，因为他们会搬到其他地方或罢工投资）。对国家的限制确实存在；确实，国家负债或国家依赖税收。但是，对我来说，这些限制具有衍生性存在——它们并不定义国家的本质性质。国家与资本主义经济的分离更多是资本主义表面现实的问题。主要问题是，这可能难以置信，现有理论中对资本主义国家的固有阶级性质的强调不够，这意味着对国家能够做出让步的程度的限制被欠缺概念化。这再现了列宁所说的对资本主义国家的“盲目信任”。 国家的阶级性质及其如何确切运作（例如它有多自主）属于不同的分析层面。它们在解释国家所做的事情方面没有相同的因果重要性。前者具有首要性。而国家的自主程度比假设的要小得多。商品，包括劳动力，可以自由交换，没有人可以强迫工人为某个资本家工作，这解释了国家的运作方式，但它并不能也不可能解释在资本主义中存在并且将存在国家的事实。资本主义中存在国家的事实是由与前资本主义中存在国家的相同事实解释的，这就是马克思/恩格斯和列宁遗产中关于国家的理论观点有用的地方。"},{"prompt":"请将“Finally, a word about the style of state theorizing. I accept that Marxist lan-guage needs to be different from the language used by others, to some extent. Marx (1887: 20) says: It is . . . self-evident that a theory which views modern capitalist production as a mere passing stage in the economic history of mankind, must make use of terms different from those habitual to writers who look upon that form of production as imperishable and final. And it can be at times a little difficult to understand in part because the content of analysis refers to fundamental, often-hidden, structures of relations. Yet a large amount of state theorizing suffers from avoidable abstractionism and verbosity.28 The ‘ratio’ of substantive content to the number of words used is often rather low. This means that statements that are super-abstract and verbose explain little about the state and can hardly be a guide to class struggle against it. Yet, there is much in existing state theory that is useful. In the next nine chapters, I combine some of the existing ideas from the post-1960s state theory with the insights from Marx and Engels as well as the ideas from Lenin (and his intellectual legacy, especially Trotsky) to offer an outline of a Marxist state theory that is broadly in line with Capital volume 1. Given the centrality of that text to my perspective, in every chapter, I begin with a question (or a comment) from that text. 3 The state and class relations In Capital volume 1, Marx (1887: 164) begins to develop his class theory by saying this: Wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production, the labourer, free or not free, must add to the working-time necessary for his own maintenance an extra working-time in order to produce the means of subsistence for the owners of the means of production. This is the case whether the property owner in question is ‘the Athenian . . . well-to-do man. . . , Etruscan theocrat, . . . Roman citizen. . . , Norman baron, American slave-owner, Wallachian Boyard, modern landlord or capitalist’ (ibid.). But would these types of property owner be able to maintain their monopoly over property and appropriate surplus labour from direct producers, without the assistance of the state? After all, and as Leon Trotsky (2008: 145) rightly says, ‘[p]roperty is a relation among people. It represents an enormous power so long as it is universally recognised and supported by that system of compulsion called Law and the State’ (italics added). But could the author of Capital really have forgotten about the state’s relation to class? As we will see in this chapter (and in the remainder of the book), Marx certainly did not. In fact, one can say that he almost began Capital volume 1 with a statement about the state, although hidden in a long footnote (as discussed later), where he talks about the state at the level of class — that is, about the class-state. Much of the Marxist state theory has been about capitalist society, which is only one form of class society. There is a need to ‘scale up’ the analysis of the state — that is, to analyse the state at the level of class relations and then at the level of, say, capitalist class relation. In this chapter, I examine the state at the level of class relations, abstracting from the nature of the state under capitalism. I begin with the claim that the state is influenced by economic relations. This claim is discussed in Section 1. The scope of ‘economic relations’ (or, economic conditions) as a concept is expanded to emphasize the structure of class relations. The state is related to class relations in Section 2. In Section 3, I focus on the state and class struggle on the assumption that the relation of the state to class relations is not the same as its relation to class struggle. To say that the state exists because of class struggles does not explain why the state does not support the exploited class in class struggle. So, in Section 4, I explore the idea that the state and the exploiting class are two arms of the totality of class relations. I thus argue for an internal relation between the state and class relations. In Section 5, state’s two main functions — basic and non-basic functions — are dealt with. The state functions on behalf of the exploiting class but not entirely so. Section 6 deals with the idea that as forms of class relation change, so do the nature and forms of the class-state. Here I also make some remarks on the state in pre-capitalist societies. Section 7 discusses how political forms of the state vary even within a given form of class society. The final section criticizes those scholars who seek to dilute the importance of the relation between property relation (which is an important aspect of class relation) and the state. It then makes remarks on some under-stressed aspects of the state in a way which has an implication for understanding the state in the post-revolution transitional society, where there are elements of the capitalist state without the capitalists. In the process, it brings to light a potential source of weakness in Lenin’s theory of the state which is that it under-emphasizes the economic conditioning of the state. 1 The state and economic relations The state is a ‘special apparatus for the systematic application of force and the subjugation of people by force’ in a class society (Lenin, 1919a). The state represents a ‘special, public power’, which ‘consists not merely of armed men’ in a standing army and police but ‘also of material adjuncts, prisons, and institutions of coercion’ (Lenin, 1949: 12).1 Of course, the state does not rule by coercion alone: ‘[T]he State is the entire complex of practical activities with which the ruling class not only justifies and maintains its dominance, but manages to win the active consent of those over whom it rules’ (Gramsci, 1971: 244). The question is, why does such a violent (territorial) apparatus exist? And when it exists, against whom is it violent, and on behalf of whom, and why? One possible explanation is that the state is a part of the wider division of labour in society. Engels says: ‘Society gives rise to certain public functions which it cannot dispense with. The persons appointed for this purpose [that is, state actors] form a new branch of the division of labor within society’ (Engels in Marx and Engels, 1975: 398). Now, the fact that the state actors perform the special functions gives ‘them particular interests, distinct, too, from the interests of their mandators’. The state actors ‘make themselves independent of the latter and — the state is in being’ (ibid.). Not just independent. Their own interests can contradict the interests of society as a whole. And, out of the ‘contradiction between the interest of the individual and that of the community the latter takes an independent form as the State , thus indicating that the state is the form of social relations, or rather contradictory relations indicative of individuals’ alienation — separation — from the community (ibid.; italics added). This form — that is, the state — is ‘divorced from the real interests of individual and community’, and yet it is at the same time as an illusory communal life, always based, however, on the real ties existing in every family and tribal conglomeration — such as flesh and blood, language, division of labour on a larger scale, and other interests-and especially, . . . on the classes. (ibid.) To the extent that the state is separate from society, this leads some to hold a view that the state came to exist because of ‘the growing complexity of social life, the differentiation of functions’ (Lenin, 1949: 13). This is a false view: the fact of growing complexity in society in itself does not explain the state’s separation from society and its particular nature: it does not explain why it is that state functions — protection and reproduction of social relations of production — need to be performed by a body that is separate from the ordinary members of society, and indeed it does not explain why it needs to be violent. Complexity may explain the need for a government (an entity to conduct some tasks in the interest of society as a whole such as protection from a pandemic) but not the need for the state as such.2 If the state represents alienation of all the people and the contradiction between individual interests and common interests of people, then why does it act on behalf of one part of society (the dominant class or the exploiting class)? Political processes cannot be explained primarily in terms of the political. As the fundamental realm of the extra-economic, the state is rooted in, and shaped by, objective economic conditions/relations which are in turn shaped by the state. The economic relations have the ultimate primacy in such interaction. Marx and Engels (1845) say: ‘[T]he social organisation evolving directly out of production and commerce . . . in all ages forms the basis of the State' (italics added). And the state shapes production and commerce too.3 As they emphasize in German ideology, the state continually evolves ‘out of the life-process of definite individuals’, but the individuals, not in terms of how ‘they may appear in their own or other people’s imagination’ but ‘as they operate, produce materially’. So it is the objectively existing ‘material life of individuals’, that is, ‘their mode of production and form of intercourse’, that forms ‘the real basis of the state and remains so at all the stages at which division of labour and private property are still necessary, quite independently of the will of individuals’ (Marx and Engels, 1845). Marx (1987) says in Poverty of philosophy: ‘Legislation, whether political or civil, never does more than proclaim, express in words, the will of economic relations.’ In Capital volume 1, Marx makes a significant point about the political (and the political includes the state) in a rather trans-historical sense. He does this, interestingly, in a famous footnote right in the very first chapter 1 of the book (in the section on the fetishism of the commodity). He begins with the idea that in certain time periods (e.g. the middle ages and ancient times), politics and religion, and not ‘material interests’, are said to reign supreme. But then, he says, ‘[T]he middle ages could not live on Catholicism, nor the ancient world on politics. On the contrary, it is the mode in which’ people living in these societies ‘gained a livelihood that explains why here politics, and there Catholicism, played the chief part' (Marx, 1887: 59; italics added).”翻译为中文","completion":"最后，关于国家理论化的风格说几句。我接受马克思主义的语言在某种程度上需要与其他人使用的语言不同。马克思（1887年：20页）说： 因此……显而易见，一个将现代资本主义生产视为人类经济历史中一个仅是过渡阶段的理论，必须使用与那些将这种生产形式视为永恒和最终形式的作家习惯性使用的术语不同的术语。 有时因为分析的内容涉及基本的、通常隐藏的关系结构，所以有点难以理解。然而大量的国家理论化受到了可以避免的抽象主义和冗长的困扰。所使用的词语数量与实质内容的“比率”往往相当低。这意味着那些超抽象和冗长的陈述对国家解释甚少，几乎不能指导对抗它的阶级斗争。 然而，现有的国家理论中有很多有用的东西。在接下来的九章中，我结合了60年代后国家理论中的一些现有观点以及马克思和恩格斯的洞察力以及列宁（及其智识遗产，特别是托洛茨基）的观点，提供了一个与《资本论》第一卷大致一致的马克思主义国家理论的概述。鉴于该文本对我的观点的中心地位，每一章我都以该文本中的一个问题（或评论）开始。 3 国家与阶级关系 在《资本论》第一卷中，马克思（1887年：164页）开始发展他的阶级理论，说： 无论在哪里，社会的一部分拥有生产资料的垄断，无论劳动者是自由的还是非自由的，除了为自己的维持所必需的工作时间之外，都必须增加额外的工作时间，以生产生活资料给生产资料的所有者。 无论问题中的财产所有者是“雅典……富裕的人……，伊特鲁里亚祭司，……罗马公民……，诺曼男爵，美国奴隶主，瓦拉几亚贵族，现代地主或资本家”（同上）。 但是，这些类型的财产所有者能够维持其对财产的垄断并从直接生产者那里占有剩余劳动力，而不需要国家的协助吗？毕竟，正如列昂·托洛茨基（2008年：145页）正确地说，“财产是人与人之间的关系。只要它被普遍认可并得到那个被称为法律和国家的强制体系的支持，它就代表着巨大的力量”（加粗部分）。 但是，《资本论》的作者真的会忘记国家与阶级的关系吗？正如我们将在本章（以及本书的剩余部分）中看到的，马克思当然没有忘记。事实上，可以说他几乎是从《资本论》第一卷的一个陈述开始讨论国家的，尽管隐藏在一个长脚注中（稍后讨论），在那里他谈到了在阶级层面的国家——也就是阶级国家。 许多马克思主义国家理论都是关于资本主义社会的，而资本主义社会只是一种形式的阶级社会。有必要“提升”对国家的分析——也就是说，在阶级关系的层面上分析国家，然后在例如资本主义阶级关系的层面上分析国家。在本章中，我在抽象出资本主义下国家的性质的情况下，检查了阶级关系层面的国家。 我从国家受经济关系影响的声明开始。该声明在第1节中进行了讨论。“经济关系”（或者，经济条件）作为一个概念的范围扩大了，以强调阶级关系的结构。第2节讨论了国家与阶级关系。在第3节中，我假设国家与阶级关系的关系不同于其与阶级斗争的关系，并专注于国家与阶级斗争。说国家是因为阶级斗争而存在的，并不能解释为什么国家不支持在阶级斗争中被剥削的阶级。因此，在第4节中，我探讨了国家与剥削阶级是阶级关系整体的两个方面的观点。因此我主张国家与阶级关系之间存在内在关系。第5节处理了国家的两个主要功能——基本和非基本功能。国家代表剥削阶级的利益，但并非完全如此。第6节讨论了随着阶级关系形式的变化，阶级国家的性质和形式也随之变化。在这里，我还对前资本主义社会中的国家做了一些评论。第7节讨论了即使在给定形式的阶级社会内，国家的政治形式也是多样化的。最后一节批评了那些试图淡化财产关系（这是阶级关系的一个重要方面）与国家之间关系重要性的学者。然后对国家的一些被忽视的方面发表了评论，这对于理解革命后过渡社会中的国家有着含义，在那里存在没有资本家的资本主义国家的元素。在此过程中，它揭示了列宁国家理论的一个潜在弱点，即它对国家的经济条件化强调不足。 1 国家与经济关系 国家是一个“用于系统化施加力量和通过暴力征服人民的特殊装置”在阶级社会中（列宁，1919a）。国家代表着一个“特殊的、公共的力量”，它“不仅仅由武装男子”组成，在一支常备军和警察中，但“也由物质附属物、监狱和强制机构”组成（列宁，1949年：12）。当然，国家不仅通过强制统治：“国家是统治阶级不仅用以证明并维持其统治的全部实际活动的总和，而且设法赢得那些被其统治的人的积极同意”（格拉姆西，1971：244）。 问题是，为什么会存在这样一个暴力（领土）装置？当它存在时，它是针对谁的暴力，代表谁，为什么？一种可能的解释是，国家是社会更广泛劳动分工的一部分。恩格斯说：“社会产生了某些它无法免除的公共职能。为此目的[即，国家行为者]指定的人员在社会内部形成了劳动分工的新分支”（恩格斯在马克思和恩格斯，1975：398）。现在，事实是，国家行为者执行特殊职能使他们“具有特殊利益，也不同于他们的委托人的利益”。国家行为者“使自己独立于后者并且——国家就形成了”（同上）。不仅是独立的。他们自己的利益可以与整个社会的利益相矛盾。而且，出于“个人利益与社区利益之间的矛盾，后者以国家的形式独立出来，表明国家是社会关系的形式，或者更准确地说是个人与社区分离的矛盾关系的指示”（同上；加粗部分）。 这种形式——即国家——“脱离了个人和社区的真实利益”，但同时它又是 一种虚幻的共同生活，但始终基于每个家庭和部落结合中存在的真实联系——如血肉、语言、更大规模的劳动分工以及其他利益——尤其是……阶级。 （同上） 在国家与社会分离的程度上，这导致有些人持有这样的观点，即国家的存在是因为“社会生活的日益复杂，职能的分化”（列宁，1949：13）。这是一个错误的观点：社会日益复杂的事实本身并不能解释国家与社会的分离及其特殊性质：它不能解释为什么国家职能——保护和再现生产关系——需要由与社会普通成员分离的机构执行，实际上它也不能解释为什么它需要暴力。复杂性可能解释了需要政府的需要（一个实体来执行一些符合整个社会利益的任务，如保护免受大流行病的侵害）但不是国家本身的需要。如果国家代表所有人的异化和个人利益与人民的共同利益之间的矛盾，那么为什么它会代表社会的一部分（统治阶级或剥削阶级）行事？ 政治过程不能主要以政治方面来解释。作为超经济的基本领域，国家植根于并由客观经济条件/关系塑造，而这些条件/关系又受国家塑造。在这种互动中，经济关系具有最终的首要地位。马克思和恩格斯（1845）说：“直接源自生产和商业的社会组织……在所有时代都构成了国家的基础”（加粗部分）。国家也塑造了生产和商业。正如他们在《德意志意识形态》中强调的，国家不断地“从特定个体的生命过程中发展出来”，但这些个体不是根据“他们在自己或其他人的想象中可能出现的方式”，而是根据“他们如何实际操作，实际生产物质”。因此，正是“个体的客观存在的‘物质生活’”，即“他们的生产方式和交往形式”，构成了“国家的真正基础，并且在劳动分工和私有财产仍然必要的所有阶段都保持如此，完全独立于个体的意愿”（马克思和恩格斯，1845）。马克思（1987）在《哲学的贫困》中说：“政治或民法立法从来不过是以言辞宣布、表达经济关系的意志。”"},{"prompt":"请将“In Capital volume 1, Marx makes a significant point about the political (and the political includes the state) in a rather trans-historical sense.

Recently, India’s (Gurcharan) Das (2003), a former CEO reincarnated as a neoliberal-capitalist ideologue, says, ‘Whereas economics is at the centre of China’s agenda, politics continues to dominate our debate in India’s Parliament, in the newspapers and on the street.’ For the Hindu Right, for which Das has sympathy, of course, Hindu culture is central to India with its 5,000 years of history. According to Hedgewar, the founder of India’s Hindu-fascistic organization, ‘The Hindu culture is the life-breath of Hindusthan [Indian society]. It is therefore clear that if Hindusthan is to be protected, we should first nourish the Hindu culture’ (quoted in Roy, 2021). Marx might have summarized these views like this: the idea that the mode of production generally determines the social, political, and intellectual life is very true for modern-day materialistic China, but not for India in which Hindu religion and politics reign supreme. Marx would then present his own alternative approach by saying, Indians during ancient period under Hindu kings could not live on Hinduism nor can they do so now under those who militantly engage in the authoritarian defence of Hinduism vis-à-vis other religions. Nor can they live on politics now, including religious politics. It is the (crisis-prone) mode in which Indians gain a livelihood that governs (a) their political and cultural life and (b) the appearance that they reign supreme vis-à-vis their economic life. For Marx, indeed, ‘the economic structure of society . . . is the real basis on which the juridical and political superstructure is raised and to which definite social forms of thought correspond’ and for him, ‘the mode of production determines the character of the social, political, and intellectual life generally’ (Marx, 1887: 58). The state is fundamentally shaped by economic conditions/relations. Engels explains what ‘economic relations’ means and how it is connected to the state. ‘By economic relations’ (or economic conditions), ‘we understand the manner in which men in a given society produce their means of subsistence and exchange the products’, so economic relations/conditions comprise ‘the entire technique of production and transport’. According to our conception this technique also determines the mode of exchange and, furthermore, of the distribution of products and hence also . . . the division [of society] into classes, and consequently the relations of lordship and servitude and consequently the state, politics, law, etc. (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 441; italics added) The state (or more generally, the political moment of society), of course, reacts back on the economic relations/conditions. In a letter, Engels clarifies the ‘materialist conception of history’ that he and Marx had developed, according to which ‘the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Neither Marx nor I have ever asserted more than this’ (Engels, in Marx and Engels, 1975: 394). More specifically: The economic situation is the basis, but the various elements of the superstructure — political forms of the class struggle and its results such as constitutions established by the victorious class after a successful battle, etc., juridical forms, and even the reflexes of all these actual struggles in the brains of the participants, political, juristic, philosophical theories, religious views and their further development into systems of dogmas — also exercise their influence upon the course of the historical struggles and in many cases preponderate in determining their form. (ibid.: 394—5; italics added) Althusser (2001: 106) makes a claim that bears some affinity to Engels’ point: ‘Class contradictions between capital and labour (as between other basic classes) are always “overdetermined” by the state, religion, political movements, national past, local customs, world context, etc.’ One can agree with this on the condition that certain processes — class relations and economic development — are more important than other processes. To understand the state, one must ask: what is it about the economic condi- tions/relations that makes the state do what it does? The state is not merely rooted in relations and conditions that are economic. The state is rooted in the class form of economic relations/conditions. To understand the state, one must begin with the economic aspects (e.g. economic development) and with the class relations of society.4 2 From economic relations to class relations (and their gender and spatial nature) In the earliest form of human society, where there was no systematic class exploitation, there was no state (a specialized coercive mechanism) as there was no need for it. Class relations and antagonisms beget, and reproduce, the state. How/why is the question. This is important to answer given the fact that the state is widely seen as a class-neutral entity. We began this chapter with Marx’s famous formulation about class in Capital 1. Monopolization over the means of production in the hands of a few creates a necessary condition for the appropriation by them of surplus product from direct producers, as Marx says. Indeed, surplus product/labour is central to class societies: Surplus-product must have been produced by the slave, or the slave-owner would not have kept any slaves. Surplus-product must have been produced by the serf, or serfdom would have been of no use to the landed gentry. Surplus-product, only to a considerably greater extent, is likewise produced by the wage worker, or the capitalist would have no need to buy labour power. (Trotsky, 1939) Class relations develop when the development of productive forces beyond the original classless society reaches a stage where the production of surplus is possible and when that surplus is taken away and controlled by a minority class from a majority class. A small group begins to control property (that is, property in the means of production) and the surplus, and others do not, and therefore the latter have to perform surplus labour. So ‘unequal’ relations of property and surplus give rise to exploitation which happens when a class — the majority class — surrenders a large part of what it produces (the surplus is that large part) to the class that controls property. And these relations are supported by the state. Classes are characterized by their position in the social system of economy, and primarily by their relation to the means of production. In [developed] . . . societies, property relations are validated by laws [of the state]. (Trotsky, 1991: 210; italics added) Or, as Lenin (1919b) famously says in his A great beginning: Classes are large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organisation of labour, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it. (italics added) The exploiting classes include slave-owners and feudal landowners in pre-cap-italist societies, and capitalists in modern societies. Exploited classes are slaves and serfs in pre-capitalist societies. Wage-workers are the main exploited class under capitalism. Capitalists and workers (the proletariat) are not the only classes, however. in every capitalist country, side by side with the proletariat, there are always broad strata of the petty bourgeoisie, small proprietors. Capitalism arose and is constantly arising out of small production. A number of new ‘middle strata’ are inevitably brought into existence again and again by capitalism (appendages to the factory, work at home, small workshops scattered all over the country to meet the requirements of big industries, such as the bicycle and automobile industries, etc.). These new small producers are just as inevitably being cast again into the ranks of the proletariat. (Lenin 1908) To the extent that the state has to be theorized from the standpoint of exploited classes, the latter, for me, include, apart from wage workers, non-exploiting strata from Lenin’s ‘broad strata of the petty bourgeoisie, small proprietors’. For convenience, I call them small-scale producers: they are small-scale property owners who do not exploit anyone and who are mainly exploited in the markets for input, output, credit and insurance. They are also exploited when they work as part-time wage-labourers. In rural areas, small-scale producers are often peasants: self-sufficient peasants (or middle peasants) and poor peasants (semiproletarians). Note that many indigenous groups are small-scale producers who may own some or all of the property collectively and whose dependence on markets may be limited and therefore they continue to hold some communitarian (‘primitive communistic’) values. I exclude what are called rich peasants (‘well-to-do peasantry’, in Lenin’s language) who are proto-capitalists, from the category of peasants and therefore from small-scale producers. I use ‘common people’ (sometimes, ‘people’), ‘the majority class’, ‘the exploited’, ‘masses’ and ‘lower classes’, to refer to workers and small-scale producers together.”翻译为中文","completion":"在《资本论》第一卷中，马克思就政治（包括国家在内的政治）以一种跨历史的意义作出了重要指点。有趣的是，他在该书第一章的一个著名脚注中提出了这一点（在商品拜物教的章节中）。他以这样一个观点开始，即在某些时期（例如中世纪和古代），政治和宗教，而非“物质利益”，被认为是至高无上的。但接着他说，“中世纪不能仅靠天主教生存，古代世界也不能仅靠政治生存。相反，正是”生活在这些社会中的人们“谋生的方式解释了为什么在这里政治，而在那里天主教，扮演了主要角色”（马克思，1887年：59页；加粗部分）。 近期，印度的（古尔查兰）达斯（2003年），一位前首席执行官转变为新自由主义资本主义意识形态家，说，“虽然经济是中国议程的中心，政治继续主导我们在印度议会、报纸和街头的辩论。” 对于达斯所同情的印度右翼来说，当然，印度文化以其5000年的历史为中心。根据印度印度教法西斯主义组织的创始人黑杰瓦尔的话，“印度教文化是印度斯坦[印度社会]的生命之息。因此很显然，如果要保护印度斯坦，我们首先应该培养印度教文化”（引自罗伊，2021年）。 马克思可能会这样概括这些观点：生产方式通常决定社会、政治和智力生活的观点对现代唯物主义的中国非常正确，但对印度则不然，在印度印度教宗教和政治占据主导地位。马克思然后会通过说，在古代印度国王统治下的印度人不能仅靠印度教生存，现在也不能在那些激进地从事对其他宗教的威权防御的人手下生存。他们现在也不能仅靠政治生活，包括宗教政治。正是印度人谋生的（危机倾向的）方式决定了（a）他们的政治和文化生活以及（b）它们相对于经济生活占据主导地位的表象。对马克思而言，确实，“社会的经济结构……是在其上建立法律和政治上层建筑并与之对应的特定社会思想形式的真实基础”，对他来说，“生产方式决定社会、政治和智力生活的性质”（马克思，1887年：58页）。 国家从根本上受经济条件/关系的影响。恩格斯解释了“经济关系”意味着什么以及它如何与国家相连。“通过经济关系”（或经济条件），“我们理解的是，人们在给定社会中如何生产他们的生存资料并交换产品”，因此经济关系/条件包括“整个生产和运输技术”。 根据我们的观点，这种技术也决定了交换方式，进而，产品的分配方式，因此也…社会的阶级分化，从而决定了领主与奴仆的关系，进而决定了国家、政治、法律等。 （引自马克思和恩格斯，1975年：441页；加粗部分） 国家（或更广义上，社会的政治时刻），当然，也会反过来对经济关系/条件产生影响。在一封信中，恩格斯澄清了他和马克思所发展的“唯物史观”，根据这一观点，“历史上最终决定因素是实际生活的生产和再生产。除此之外，马克思和我从未断言过更多”（恩格斯，引自马克思和恩格斯，1975年：394页）。更具体地说： 经济形势是基础，但上层建筑的各种要素——阶级斗争的政治形式及其结果，如战斗胜利后由胜利的阶级建立的宪法等，法律形式，甚至所有这些实际斗争的反映在参与者头脑中的政治、法律、哲学理论，宗教观点及其进一步发展成的教条体系——也对历史斗争的进程施加影响，在许多情况下在决定其形式方面占据主导地位。 （同上：394-5页；加粗部分） 阿尔都塞（2001年：106页）提出了一个与恩格斯观点有些相似的主张：“资本和劳动之间的阶级矛盾（以及其他基本阶级之间）总是被国家、宗教、政治运动、国家历史、地方习俗、世界背景等‘过度决定’。” 在某些过程——阶级关系和经济发展——比其他过程更重要的条件下，可以同意这一点。 要理解国家，必须问：是经济条件/关系的哪些方面使国家做了它所做的事？国家不仅仅植根于经济的关系和条件。国家植根于经济关系/条件的阶级形式。要理解国家，必须从经济方面（例如经济发展）和社会的阶级关系开始。"},{"prompt":"请将“2 From economic relations to class relations (and their gender and spatial nature) In the earliest form of human society, where there was no systematic class exploitation, there was no state (a specialized coercive mechanism) as there was no need for it.

I use ‘common people’ (sometimes, ‘people’), ‘the majority class’, ‘the exploited’, ‘masses’ and ‘lower classes’, to refer to workers and small-scale producers together. The relations among classes in the social economy — property relations and performance-appropriation of unpaid labour — shape, and are shaped by, the state. As Marx (1894: 576) explains in Capital volume 3: ‘The specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of direct producers, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled’, as that relation ‘grows directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determinant’. Marx adds that it is ‘the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the immediate producers’, that is, the class relationship, ‘in which we find the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire social edifice’; the ‘upper layer’ of this edifice is the state (ibid.). In sum, economic development and class relations, which mutually influence one another and constitute the economic moment of society, together shape the state (and the state shapes the economic moment, in turn, as we will see). One cannot understand the state without understanding its causal relation to class relations across class societies. Marx (1844) says: [T]he slavery of civil society is the natural foundation of the modern state, just as the civil society of slavery was the natural foundation of the state in antiquity. The existence of the state is inseparable from the existence of slavery. The state and slavery in antiquity — frank and open classical antitheses — were not more closely welded together than the modern state and the cut-throat world of modern business. There are two additional points that need to be made about the relation between class relations and the state. One is that in class society, it is not only the case that surplus is appropriated from the majority class and concentrated in the hands of a minority class, thus forming the basis of the state. It is also the case that surplus is taken away from certain kinds of areas (e.g. rural areas or indeed less developed regions) and geographically concentrated in other kinds of areas (e.g. urban areas or more developed areas). There is an urbanization of class relations and class exploitation. Emergence of class society coincides with a geographical form of social antagonism. In ancient society, with its ‘class relation between citizens and slaves’: We already find the antagonism of town and country; later the antagonism between those states which represent town interests and those which represent country interests, and inside the towns themselves the antagonism between industry and maritime commerce.

Therefore ‘[t]he commune . . . does not in fact exist as a state or political body, as in classical antiquity, because it does not exist as a city’ (ibid.). Marx says that ‘[w]ith its coming-together in the city, the commune possesses an economic existence as such; the city’s mere presence, as such, distinguishes it from a mere multiplicity of independent houses’ (ibid.). There arises not only town-country dichotomy in a class society. With ‘unequal’ class relations also rise unequal gender relations whereby a disproportionate amount of reproductive work in the sphere of the family falls on women and where men come to control property more than women do (Das, 2022b). People not only produce and reproduce the means of subsistence (e.g. food and shelter) and the material means to produce them. They also need to produce the animate and conscious tools without which such production will not occur: human beings. Marx and Engels (1845) say that men and women, ‘who daily remake their own life, begin to make other’ men and women, ‘to propagate their kind’. This means that ‘the relation between man and woman, parents and children, the family’ comes to constitute an important aspect of ‘historical development’ of humanity. ‘[The] family. . . [is] where wife and children are the slaves of the husband. This latent slavery in the family . . . is the first property’ (ibid.). If the state is the institution that defends and codifies the rules of private property (in inanimate objects), this imperative contributes to the state defending and codifying the unequal relations between adult men on the one hand and adult women and children on the other, although the state’s role in defending private property has primacy. Thus, as a class society arises, four kinds of unequal relation come into being. These are unequal relations: between classes, between rural and urban areas, between men and women, and between the state and dominated/exploited classes. 3 The state and class struggle The objective existence of class relations is one thing. Class struggle is a different matter, even if the two are closely connected. Class struggle is the proximate factor that drives the (changes in the) relations between the state on the one hand and relations of property and surplus labour (i.e. class relations) on the other. In all societies, with or without classes, human beings have certain needs — need for food and shelter, and so on, as well as need for culture — which must be met to ensure their continued existence (reproduction). In class societies these needs are not met for a vast majority. This is because of the structure of class relations (i.e. lack of control over property and surplus, and so on) and because of the concrete effects of class relations on people (i.e. unequal distribution of income, leisure time, and the like). Because of the operation of class relations, there is not only (increasing) concentration of control over productive resources in the hands of a few but also appropriation of surplus from direct producers. An artificial social scarcity is created: scarcity both in the access to the means of production and means of consumption. The fact that common people have needs that have to be satisfied goes against the interest of the exploiting class and of those who are primarily responsible for managing the state. To the extent that people’s needs are not met, there is bound to be a struggle on their part, sometimes covert, sometimes overt, sometimes violent, and sometimes peaceful. Potential and actual class struggle from below, therefore, in turn, necessitates a set of institutions to keep the majority suppressed by the use of, or the threat of the use of, violence, and by less violent means. In other words, a political mechanism must exist which keeps the people subju- gated/suppressed and to meet the needs of the property owners, on the basis of the use of violent and non-violent methods, with the threat of violence always being there. When class struggle happens, this cannot be suppressed directly by people themselves based on persuasion or by localized coercion exercised by people themselves. The conflict over the unequal control over property and surplus labour is far too fundamental — it is unresolvable within the sphere of society where people pursue their individual interests. A separate body is needed to maintain order, order in a class society: the need to maintain order takes a class colour. A separate social sphere is necessary to ensure that the classes with conflicting economic interests do not consume themselves and the society as a whole in fruitless antagonistic struggle. So in a class society, ‘it became necessary to have a power, seemingly standing above society, that would alleviate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of ‘order’ (Engels, 1884: chapter 9). And, ‘this power, arisen out of society but placing itself above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is the state’ (ibid.). By keeping class struggle in check, the state makes it possible for the monopolistic control over property in the hands of a few as well as class exploitation (appropriation of surplus labour from direct producers by property owners) to continue. The fact that ‘the state arose from the need to keep class antagonisms in check, but also arose in the thick of the fight between the classes’, as Engels says, implies that the state ‘is normally the state of the most powerful, economically ruling class, which by its means becomes also the politically ruling class, and so acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class’ (ibid.). Lenin connects Marx’s theory of class exploitation (the idea, as mentioned before, that ‘Wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production’, there will be exploitation of direct producers by the minority class) to the state, when he says: History shows that the state as a special apparatus for coercing people arose wherever and whenever there appeared a division of society into classes, that is, a division into groups of people some of which were permanently in a position to appropriate the labour of others, where some people exploited others. (Lenin, 1919a) Every economically dominant class, or a class in the process of becoming economically dominant, seeks mastery over the state which, to use Marx’s words, is the ‘concentrated and organised force of society’ (Marx, 1887: 534; italics added). Engels (1884) says that the state is ‘the official representative of society as a whole’, but it is the official representative of class society. The state is ‘the state of that class which itself [represents], for its own time, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slaveowning citizens; in the Middle Age, of the feudal nobility; in our own time, of the bourgeoisie’ (ibid.). The ancient state was, above all, the state of the slave-owners for holding down the slaves, just as the feudal state was the organ of the nobility for holding down the peasant serfs and bondsmen, and the modern representative state is the instrument for exploiting wage-labor by capital. (ibid.) The state consists ‘of a group of people engaged solely, or almost solely, or mainly, in ruling’ (Lenin, 1919a). As soon as the society is divided into the exploiter (the minority) and the exploited classes (majority), ‘[p]eople are [also] divided into the ruled, and into specialists in ruling, those who rise above society and are called rulers, statesmen’ (Lenin, 1919a). Indeed, ‘[the] exploiters inevitably transform the state . . . into an instrument of the rule of their class, the exploiters, over the exploited’ (Lenin, 1918). As we have seen, appropriation of surplus product is central to how class societies operate. Surplus product is produced by slaves, serfs, wage workers, and the like, which is why these classes exist, and because they exist there is class struggle over surplus product as appropriation of their surplus adversely impacts their interests: The class struggle is nothing else than the struggle for surplus-product. He who owns surplus-product is master of the situation — owns wealth, owns the state, has the key to the church, to the courts, to the sciences and to the arts. (Trotsky, 1939; italics added) Indeed, ‘[h]istory is full of the constant attempts of the oppressed classes to throw off oppression. The history of slavery contains records of wars of emancipation from slavery which lasted for decades’ (Lenin, 1919a). The class struggle from below, the struggle of the masses, has to be negated. This is no laughing matter, however: to achieve the task of negation, the state must be, ultimately, a violent institution. ‘Neither under slavery nor under the feudal system could a small minority of people dominate over the vast majority without coercion’ (Lenin, 1919a). Because the state represents the exploiting class, it therefore represents a minority, because the exploiting class is always a minority.”翻译为中文","completion":"在《马克思恩格斯全集》中，马克思（1973：483页）说：“就像日耳曼部落中的个别家族首领在森林中定居，彼此相隔很远，公社的存在......只体现在公社成员的定期聚集中，尽管他们的内在统一性体现在他们的血统、语言、共同的过去和历史等方面。”马克思总结说：“因此，公社出现为一种聚合，而非共同存在；作为由独立主体组成的统一体，是土地所有者，而非作为一个统一体。”因此，“公社......实际上并不存在于国家或政治实体中，如同古代古典时期一样，因为它并不存在于一个城市中”（同上）。马克思说，“随着其在城市中的聚集，公社具有了其作为一个经济实体的存在；仅仅城市本身的存在，就将它区别于一系列独立房屋的简单多样性”（同上）。 在阶级社会中，不仅出现了城乡二分法。随着“不平等”的阶级关系的出现，也出现了不平等的性别关系，其中大量的生殖工作落在女性身上，而男性则比女性更多地控制财产（达斯，2022b）。人们不仅需要生产和再生产生存资料（例如食物和住所）以及生产这些资料的物质手段。他们还需要生产没有这些生产活动就无法进行的有生命和有意识的工具：人类。马克思和恩格斯（1845）说，男性和女性，“每天重塑自己的生活，开始创造其他”男性和女性，“繁衍他们的种类”。这意味着“男女之间的关系，父母与子女之间的关系，家庭”成为了“人类历史发展”的一个重要方面。“家庭……[是]妻子和孩子是丈夫的奴隶的地方。这种家庭中潜在的奴役……是第一种财产”（同上）。如果国家是保卫和制定无生命物体的私有财产规则的机构，那么这个必要性有助于国家保卫和制定成年男性与成年女性和儿童之间的不平等关系，尽管国家在保卫私有财产方面的作用具有首要性。 因此，随着阶级社会的出现，产生了四种不平等关系。这些是类别之间、农村与城市之间、男性与女性之间以及国家与被统治/被剥削阶级之间的不平等关系。 3 国家与阶级斗争 阶级关系的客观存在是一回事。阶级斗争是另一回事，即使两者紧密相连。阶级斗争是推动（国家与财产和剩余劳动关系（即阶级关系）之间的关系变化的最直接因素。 在所有社会中，无论有无阶级，人类都有某些需求——食物和住所等需求，以及文化需求——这些需求必须得到满足以确保他们的持续存在（再生产）。在阶级社会中，这些需求对绝大多数人来说是无法满足的。这是由于阶级关系的结构（即对财产和剩余的控制缺乏等等）和阶级关系对人们的具体影响（即收入、休闲时间等的不平等分配）造成的。由于阶级关系的运作，不仅是（增加的）对生产资源的控制集中在少数人手中，而且是对直接生产者的剩余劳动的占有。人为的社会匮乏被创造出来：既是对生产资料又是对消费资料获取途径的匮乏。普通人有需要得到满足的需求，这与剥削阶级的利益和那些主要负责管理国家的人的利益相悖。在人们的需求得不到满足的程度上，他们一定会进行斗争，有时是隐秘的，有时是公开的，有时是暴力的，有时是和平的。来自下层的潜在和实际的阶级斗争因此需要一套机构来通过使用或威胁使用暴力以及较少暴力的手段来压制多数。换句话说，必须存在一个政治机制，这个机制保持人民被征服/压制，并以使用暴力和非暴力方法的方式满足财产所有者的需求，暴力的威胁始终存在。 当阶级斗争发生时，这种冲突无法直接通过人们自己基于说服或人们自己实施的局部性强制来压制。对财产和剩余劳动的不平等控制的冲突太过根本——它是无法在人们追求个人利益的社会领域内解决的。需要一个独立的机构来维持秩序，在阶级社会中维持秩序：维持秩序的需要带有阶级色彩。需要一个独立的社会领域来确保具有冲突经济利益的阶级不会在无果的对抗性斗争中消耗自己和整个社会。因此，在阶级社会中，“出现了一种力量，看似站在社会之上，减轻冲突并将其保持在‘秩序’的范围内”（恩格斯，1884年：第9章）。而“这一力量，源于社会但将自己置于社会之上，并与之越来越疏远，就是国家”（同上）。通过控制阶级斗争，国家使得少数人对财产的垄断控制以及阶级剥削（财产所有者对直接生产者的剩余劳动的占有）得以继续。正如恩格斯所说，“国家产生于控制阶级对立的需要，但也是在阶级斗争中产生的”，这意呅着国家“通常是最有力的、经济上统治的阶级的国家，通过它的手段，也成为政治上统治的阶级，因此获得了新的手段来压迫和剥削被压迫阶级”（同上）。 列宁将马克思的阶级剥削理论（如前所述，即“社会的一部分拥有生产资料的垄断”，将会有直接生产者被少数阶级剥削）与国家联系起来，当他说： 历史表明，只要出现了社会分化为阶级，也就是分化为一些人长期占据剥削他人的位置的群体时，就会出现针对人民的特殊强制装置即国家。 （列宁，1919a） 每一个经济上占主导地位的阶级，或者正在成为经济上占主导地位的阶级，都寻求控制国家，而国家，用马克思的话来说，是“社会集中和组织化的力量”（马克思，1887年：534页；加粗部分）。恩格斯（1884年）说，国家是“整个社会的官方代表”，但它是阶级社会的官方代表。国家是“在其时代代表整个社会的那个阶级的国家：在古代是奴隶所有者公民的国家；在中世纪是封建贵族的国家；在我们这个时代是资产阶级的国家”（同上）。 古代国家首先是奴隶主为压迫奴隶的国家，正如封建国家是贵族为压迫农奴和束缚农民的机构，现代代表国家是作为资本剥削工资劳动的工具。 （同上） 国家由“唯一或几乎唯一或主要从事统治的一群人”组成（列宁，1919a）。一旦社会分裂为剥削者（少数）和被剥削阶级（多数），“人们[也]被分为被统治者，和统治专家，那些凌驾于社会之上并被称为统治者、政治家的人”（列宁，1919a）。事实上，“剥削者不可避免地将国家......转变为他们阶级的统治工具，剥削者，对被剥削者的统治工具”（列宁，1918年）。 正如我们所看到的，剩余产品的占有是阶级社会运作方式的核心。奴隶、农奴、工资工人等生产的剩余产品，这就是为什么这些阶级存在的原因，因为他们存在，就存在对剩余产品的阶级斗争，因为他们的剩余被占有，对他们的利益产生不利影响： 阶级斗争不过是对剩余产品的斗争。拥有剩余产品的人掌握了局势——拥有财富，拥有国家，掌握了教堂、法庭、科学和艺术的钥匙。 （托洛茨基，1939年；加粗部分） 事实上，“历史充满了被压迫阶级不断尝试摆脱压迫的记录。奴隶制的历史包含了解放战争的记录，这些战争持续了几十年”（列宁，1919a）。来自下层的阶级斗争，群众的斗争，必须被抵消。然而，这不是一件小事：为了完成抵消任务，国家最终必须是一个暴力机构。“无论在奴隶制还是封建制度下，少数人都无法在没有强制的情况下支配绝大多数人”（列宁，1919a）。因为国家代表剥削阶级，所以它代表少数人，因为剥削阶级总是少数。"},{"prompt":"请将“To represent the interests of a minority against those of a majority, systemic use of, or the threat of the use of, force is necessary in order to make it possible for class exploitation to exist and continue and to ensure that the low- class struggle does not threaten dominant-class property rights. That force is the state. Its ‘bureaucratic military state machine’ oppresses, crushes, the masses (Lenin, 1949: 40). A violent public power with an enormous means of physical coercion is indeed necessary because ‘a self-acting armed organization of the population has become impossible since the split into classes’ (Lenin, 1949: 12). ‘The state is a special organization . . . of violence for the suppression of some class’ in the interest of other classes (Lenin, 1949: 26).5 [The state is] a special category of people set apart to rule others and who, for the sake and purpose of rule, systematically and permanently have at their disposal a certain apparatus of coercion, an apparatus of violence, such as is represented at the present time . . . by armed contingents of troops, prisons and other means of subjugating the will of others by force — all that which constitutes the essence of the state. (Lenin, 1919a: italics added) It is inadequate to say that the state exists merely for the defence of society. ‘It is not the tasks of defense which create a military and state bureaucracy, but the class structure of society carried over into the organization of defense. The army is only a copy of the social relations’ (Trotsky, 1991: 44). The use of violence is a part of a wider set of processes embodied in the state: The State is not an end in itself. It is only a machine [an instrument] in the hands of the dominating social forces. Like every machine it has its motor, transmitting and executive mechanism. The driving force of the State is class interest; its motor mechanism is agitation, the press, church and school propaganda, parties, street meetings, petitions and revolts. The transmitting mechanism is the legislative organization of caste, dynastic, estate or class interests represented as the will of God (absolutism) or the will of the nation (parliamentarism). Finally, the executive mechanism is the administration, with its police, the courts, with their prisons, and the army. (Trotsky, 1931b) The state exists not only because of the structure class relations: in fact, it exists both because of the mechanisms of class relations and because of the effects of class relations (e.g. inequality in income and access to consumption items). The second reason, one that Lenin tends to miss, needs some emphasis (I return to this in the Conclusion section). As long as there is not enough for everyone to meet their needs and therefore access to resources has to be regulated, there has to be a regulatory mechanism backed by the use of force. That mechanism is the state. In societies where the level of development of the productive forces is low, where everyone is in a constant struggle with everyone else to get enough to live on for himself out of a national income too small to go around, a large supervisory apparatus becomes necessary. (Mandel, 1969) Therefore, [a]ll who exercise state functions, who are part of the state apparatus, are — in one way or another — watchdogs. Special police and regular police are watchdogs, but so are tax collectors, judges, paper pushers in government offices, fare-collectors on buses, etc. In sum, all functions of the state apparatus are reduced to this: surveillance and control of the life of the society in the interests of the ruling class. (Mandel, 1969) Indeed, the state is necessary to ‘regulate inequalities in the sphere of consumption’ (Trotsky, 1991: 47), which is an effect of a combination of (a) the low level of the development of productive forces (which can be fettered by existing class relations) and (b) the lack of control of the masses over production. In a series of interesting but relatively neglected lines on the state, Sartre (1960) makes some insightful comments that reinforce what has been said earlier: The State. . . exists for the sake of the dominant class, but as a practical sup-pression of class conflicts within the national totalization. If classes exist. . . , then, in effect, the State institutes itself in their struggle as the organ of the exploiting class (or classes) and sustains, by constraint, the statute of the oppressed classes. (p. 637) [T]he State cannot take on its functions without positing itself as a mediator between the exploiting and the exploited classes. The State is a determination of the dominant class, and this determination is conditioned by class struggle. But it affirms itself as a deep negation of the class struggle. (p. 639) To sum up, the state must ensure the extraction of social surplus from direct producers. Exploitation is possible only when monopolistic control over property exists. So, in all societies, the state defends the exploitative relations of private property in the means of production. The state has to be thus seen within the context of the relation between those who control society’s productive resources and those who do not, which shapes the class character of the state, which in turn shapes its relation with those who are ruled. Indeed, property ‘represents an enormous power so long as it is . . . supported by that system of compulsion called Law and the State’ (Trotsky, 2008: 145; italics added). The state must also defend the conditions of inequality in consumption. Finally, and to reinforce a point made earlier, ‘it appears that the state does reconcile classes’, while in reality, and ‘according to Marx, the state is an organ of class rule’ (Lenin, 1949: 11). Most people believe that the state creates and maintains order. But for Marxists, as Lenin says, this order means, above all, not ‘the reconciliation of classes’ but ‘the oppression of one class by another’. People say that the state alleviates class conflicts, but to alleviate class conflicts means, once again, not reconciling classes but ‘depriving the oppressed classes of definite means and methods of struggle to overthrow the oppressors’ (Lenin, 1949: 11). 4 The state and the dominant class as two arms of the class structure The idea that the state as a structure of relations originates in the structure of class relations does not fully resolve an important question concerning the nature of the state. For me, quite precisely, the question is as follows. If the state has to ensure that the antagonistic classes might not consume themselves and society in sterile struggle (Engels, 1884), then why does the state not work on behalf of the majority class, those who produce surplus? Would maintaining order and keeping class conflicts within limits not be easier if the state is in the hands of the majority class? If it is the case that elements in the dominant class control the public authority whose main task is to serve the common interests of society, what is it about the state that allows such control, and why does the majority class (the exploited) not control the state? If the state is the state of the economically dominant class, then it cannot be because: there is the state, there is the economically dominant class, and they just come together in a mutual alliance. Since the beginning of class society, the people who perform the role of the state, and the people who, with their monopolistic control over society’s productive resources, are the exploiting class, are two parts of the same totality. This is the totality of class relations. The nature of the overlap in terms of ‘personnel’ or agency — the extent to which state managers themselves appropriate surplus product or those who appropriate surplus product are also state managers — is a contingent matter. The structure of class relations thus has a necessarily political character: the state and the exploiting class are two arms of the body of class relationship. One arm signifies economic exploitation and exclusion, and another arm signifies political oppression (and also exploitation via taxation, forced labour, and the like). Of course, the nature of the economically dominant class changes (slave owners to nobility, and so on). Whichever class is the rising class economically is the class that seeks to control political power; the political power belongs to the economically dominant class. As Marx and Engels (1845) say in German ideology, ‘every class which is struggling for mastery . . . must first conquer for itself political power in order to represent its interest in turn as the general interest’. Then this means that in every class society, there is a class that lacks political power and that therefore it struggles for political mastery. Power and powerless-ness in terms of the control over the state are hallmarks of ‘classness’. The class that controls means of production and its use is the class that generally controls political power, including its coercive and ideological apparatuses. The class that lacks the control over property and its surplus is the class that lacks control over state power and must therefore achieve it for it to gain — or reinforce/ sustain — control over the economic aspects of class structure of society (i.e. property, production, surplus, and so on). The economically exploited men and women are the people who are the governed/ruled. The economically exploiting men and women are the ruling class. The structure of the state (i.e. political power as it is concentrated in the state) and the structure of class relations are internally (i.e. necessarily) connected. One cannot exist without another. If the class relation is ‘the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the immediate producers’ (Marx, 1894: 576), then the state must be seen as the direct political relationship between the two basic classes. Indeed, as Marx says in Jewish question, ‘From a political point of view, the state and the organization of society are not two different things. The state is the organization of [class] society’ (Marx, 1844). And, as Engels says:”翻译为中文","completion":"为了代表少数人的利益对抗多数人的利益，必须系统性地使用，或威胁使用，暴力是必要的，以使阶级剥削得以存在和继续，并确保低阶级斗争不会威胁到统治阶级的财产权利。这种力量就是国家。其“官僚军事国家机器”压迫、打压大众（列宁，1949：40）。自从阶级分裂以来，一个自动武装的人民组织已变得不可能，确实需要一个拥有巨大物理强制手段的暴力公共权力（列宁，1949：12）。“国家是一个特别的组织……是为了压制某个阶级而存在的暴力”代表其他阶级的利益（列宁，1949：26）。 说国家仅仅是为了保卫社会而存在是不够的。“并不是防御任务创造了军事和国家官僚机构，而是社会的阶级结构转化为防御组织。军队只是社会关系的复制品”（托洛茨基，1991：44）。 暴力的使用是体现在国家中的一系列更广泛过程的一部分： 国家不是自身的目的。它只是统治社会力量手中的一台机器[一种工具]。像每台机器一样，它有其 动力、传动和执行机构。国家的驱动力是阶级利益；其动力机构是鼓动、新闻、教会和学校宣传、政党、街头集会、请愿和起义。传动机构是代表神意（专制主义）或民族意志（议会制）的贵族、王朝、等级或阶级利益的立法组织。最后，执行机构是行政管理，及其警察力量、法院，有其监狱，以及军队。 （托洛茨基，1931b） 国家的存在不仅仅是因为阶级关系的结构：事实上，它的存在是因为阶级关系的机制以及阶级关系的效果（例如，收入和消费品获取的不平等）。列宁倾向于忽视的第二个原因，需要一些强调（我将在结论部分回到这一点）。只要人们的需求得不到满足，因此必须对资源获取进行规范，就必须有一个由暴力支持的监管机制。那个机制就是国家。 在生产力发展水平较低的社会中，每个人都在为了从国民收入中获得足够的生活资料而与他人进行不断的斗争，这些收入对所有人来说都不够用，因此需要一个庞大的监督机构。 （曼德尔，1969） 因此， 所有执行国家职能、是国家机器一部分的人 —— 无论以何种方式 —— 都是看门狗。特警和常规警察是看门狗，但税务官员、法官、政府办公室的文职人员、公交车上的售票员等也是。总之，国家机器的所有职能都可以归结为此：监视和控制社会生活以服务于统治阶级的利益。 （曼德尔，1969） 事实上，国家是必要的，以“调节消费领域的不平等”（托洛茨基，1991：47），这是生产力发展水平较低（可能受到现有阶级关系的阻碍）和大众对生产缺乏控制的结合效应。 在关于国家的一系列有趣但相对被忽视的论述中，萨特（1960）提出了一些深刻的评论，这些评论加强了之前所说的内容： 国家......存在是为了统治阶级的利益，但作为民族整体内部阶级冲突的实际压制。 如果存在阶级......，那么，实际上，国家在它们的斗争中以剥削阶级（或阶级）的器官自居，并通过强制维持被压迫阶级的地位。 （第637页） 国家不能承担其职能，而不将自己定位为剥削阶级与被剥削阶级之间的调解者。国家是统治阶级的决定因素，这个决定因素受阶级斗争的制约。但它自我确认为对阶级斗争的深刻否定。 （第639页） 总结，国家必须确保从直接生产者那里提取社会剩余。只有当对财产的垄断控制存在时，剥削才有可能。因此，在所有社会中，国家都捍卫私有财产在生产资料中的剥削性关系。必须在那些控制社会生产资源的人与那些不控制的人之间的关系背景下看待国家，这决定了国家的阶级性质，进而决定了它与被统治者的关系。事实上，财产“只要……得到法律和国家所称的那套强制系统的支持，就代表着巨大的力量”（托洛茨基，2008：145页；加粗部分）。国家还必须捍卫消费中的不平等条件。 最后，再次强调之前提出的一点，“国家似乎调和了阶级”，而实际上，正如马克思所说，“国家是阶级统治的器官”（列宁，1949：11）。大多数人认为国家创造并维护秩序。但对马克思主义者来说，正如列宁所说，这个秩序意味着，最重要的不是“阶级的调和”，而是“一阶级对另一阶级的压迫”。人们说国家缓和了阶级冲突，但缓和阶级冲突意味着，再次，不是调和阶级，而是“剥夺被压迫阶级以推翻压迫者的特定手段和方法”（列宁，1949：11）。 4 国家和统治阶级作为阶级结构的两臂 国家作为关系结构源于阶级关系的结构这一观点，并没有完全解决关于国家性质的重要问题。对我而言，这个问题非常明确。如果国家必须确保敌对阶级不会在毫无成果的斗争中消耗自身和社会（恩格斯，1884），那么为什么国家不代表多数阶级，那些生产剩余的人？如果国家掌握在多数阶级手中，维持秩序和将阶级冲突限制在一定范围内是否不会更容易？如果是统治阶级中的元素控制了主要任务是服务于社会共同利益的公共权力，那么国家有什么特点允许这种控制，为什么多数阶级（被剥削者）不控制国家？如果国家是经济上占主导地位的阶级的国家，那么这不可能是因为：有国家，有经济上占主导地位的阶级，他们只是在相互联盟中聚合在一起。 自阶级社会出现以来，扮演国家角色的人，以及凭借其对社会生产资源的垄断控制成为剥削阶级的人，是同一整体的两部分。这是阶级关系的整体。在“人员”或代理人方面的重叠程度——国家管理者本身占有剩余产品的程度或占有剩余产品的人也是国家管理者的程度——是一个偶然的问题。因此，阶级关系的结构具有必然的政治特征：国家和剥削阶级是阶级关系之体的两臂。一臂象征经济剥削和排斥，另一臂象征政治压迫（也通过税收、强迫劳动等形式的剥削）。当然，经济上占主导地位的阶级的性质会发生变化（从奴隶主到贵族等）。在经济上成为上升阶级的阶级是寻求控制政治权力的阶级；政治权力属于经济上占主导地位的阶级。正如马克思和恩格斯（1845）在《德意志意识形态》中所说，“每一个为争夺统治地位而斗争的......阶级……必须首先为自己争取政治权力，以便依次将其利益作为一般利益来代表”。 然后这意味着在每个阶级社会中，都有一个缺乏政治权力的阶级，因此它为政治霸权而斗争。对于控制国家的能力和无力感是“阶级性”的标志。控制生产资料及其使用的阶级通常是控制政治权力的阶级，包括其强制和意识形态的机构。缺乏对财产及其剩余的控制的阶级是缺乏对国家权力的控制的阶级，因此必须获得它，以便获得——或强化/维持——对社会阶级结构的经济方面的控制（即财产、生产、剩余等）。被经济剥削的男性和女性是被统治/受治理的人。经济剥削者男性和女性是统治阶级。 国家结构（即集中在国家中的政治权力）和阶级关系的结构内在地（即必然地）联系在一起。没有另一个就不能存在。如果阶级关系是“生产条件所有者与直接生产者的直接关系”（马克思，1894：576），那么国家必须被视为两个基本阶级之间的直接政治关系。事实上，正如马克思在《犹太人问题》中所说，“从政治角度来看，国家和社会组织不是两件不同的事情。国家是[阶级]社会的组织”（马克思，1844）。正如恩格斯所说："},{"prompt":"请将“The possessing classes — the landed aristocracy and the bourgeoisie — keep the working people in servitude not only by the power of their wealth, by the simple exploitation of labour by capital, but also by the power of the state — by the army, the bureaucracy, the courts. (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 244; italics added) So, the servitude of the majority class (workers and small-scale producers) consists of two inter-connected mechanisms: economic exploitation by the possessing classes (mainly capitalists) and political subjugation through the power of the state. The power of the state, ultimately, is the political power of the exploited class, more or less, is ‘the most concentrated strength of the ruling class’ (Trotsky, 1977: 122): [The state’s] nature is political. . . , because the state, the instrument of power, is the political superstructure par excellence upon the economic foundation. But this political power serves not only to ‘regulate’ political matters, in the narrow, technical sense of the word, (that is, internal matters of the state apparatus itself), but also and above all economic, cultural, ecclesiastical and other matters. (ibid.) The state power is necessarily a form of class power, even if the exercise of state power is mediated by the internal structure of the state and by the interests of self-seeking politicians and officials. That is, the relation between the two forms of power is an internal one and not an external one. The state power is, ultimately, the power of the exploiting classes in all pre-socialist class societies. So, how class relationships influence the state and how the relatively autonomous state elites react to the pressures of class and act in their own interests as well belong to what is called state theory. 5 Class society and state functions The state has basic (primary) functions and non-basic (secondary) functions. In terms of economic function, the state tries to make sure that the propertyowning class is able to augment its property by appropriating surplus labour and in other ways (e.g. war, colonization, and so on). Marx (1887: 534) wrote of ‘the power of the state’ as an economic power in that it seeks to ‘hasten . . . the process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode’. In terms of the political function, which ultimately is the main function, the state’s role is to keep the masses in check, as already indicated. However, the state also performs many secondary tasks, so its tasks are not exclusively on behalf of the economically dominant class. There are the functions which any government must perform in order to keep the society going, whether or not they are of any direct special advantage to the ruling class. These include: measures against a pandemic; city sanitation; protection against natural disasters; and promotion of education, culture, and health. A given state, with its own geographical boundary, exists as a member of the family of states. As a ‘national’ state, it manages the common affairs of the ruling-class people with their different interests under its jurisdiction as against the rival ruling classes operating under the jurisdictions of other states. It helps its own ruling class remain competitive vis-à-vis its rivals. Military spending is partly about this. Besides, the ruling class itself is shot through with intra-class economic and other conflicts, so the state has to resolve conflicts within the ruling class. The state also has to resolve conflicts within the class of direct producers. And the state might pursue tasks that serve the interests of those who manage its affairs, even if it has to act against the dominant class once in a while: The task of the political state is not just to serve the immediate interests of the governing class. It must also act to preserve social cohesion; and though these two goals are ultimately at one, there can be acute conflict between them in the short or middle term. (Eagleton, 2011: 205) The state’s main task is the reason why the state exists (i.e. keeping the exploited masses in check and reproduce existing class relations).6 The non-basic tasks are more governmental rather than ‘statal’ or state-related: the governmental tasks would continue even without class divisions. So every action of the state is not to be seen as being ‘necessarily in the direct collective interest of the ruling class’ (Creaven, 2000: 192). But when there is a conflict between the basic and non-basic tasks, the latter will be subordinated to the basic task. Whenever there is a serious danger to property rights of the ruling class, various fractions of the ruling class (and their political representatives) tend to be united. The state helps them unite. It acts as their greatest chamber of commerce or trade union organization. As Sartre says, ‘the State constitutes itself as a mediation between conflicts within the dominant class, in so far as these conflicts run the risk of weakening it in the face of the dominated classes’. [The state] embodies and realises the general interest of the dominant class over and above the antagonisms and conflicts of particular interests. This amounts to saying that the ruling class produces its State. (Sartre, 1960: 638) Even when the state performs its general tasks, these are performed in ways that are shaped by its class character as the state of the economically dominant class.7 Precisely because of this, that is, because the state is dominantly the state of the exploiting class, which is a small minority in all class societies, there is a need to maintain its class neutrality. The state must appear to be above society, to be above the conflicts between and within classes. The real contradiction of the State is that it is a class apparatus pursuing class objectives and, at the same time, positing itself for itself as the sovereign unity of all, that is, in the absolute Other-Being which is the nation. (Sartre, 1960: 642) Apart from the distinction between the main and secondary tasks, there is another distinction to be made: a dialectical distinction between what the state does and what it decides not to do. In a society with class divisions (and class fractional divisions), what the state does for one class (or class fraction) amounts to it not doing anything for the opposed class (or opposed class fraction). If the property owners are thrashing the masses for opposing exploitation and if the state does not do anything to stop the property owners, then from one angle, this means that the state is not doing anything for the masses and that it is doing something for the ruling class. From another angle, this also means that the state is doing something for the exploited: it is ensuring a condition for them to continue to be exploited and subjugated. 6 Forms of class relation and forms of class-state: some historical examples The state and class relations are internally related. As the form of class relation changes, there is also a change in the form of the class-state, including the degree of the structural overlap between state personnel and the ruling-class people. While it is true that class societies are different one from another on the basis of ‘the mode in which . . . surplus-labour is in each case extracted from the actual producer, the labourer’ (Marx, 1887: 153), what is common to all forms of class society is that surplus labour is extracted. A presupposition of surplus extraction is that effective control over property is in the hands of a minority in the face of potential and actual opposition from the exploited. And this is not possible without the state. As mentioned, the state exists wherever there are class divisions. And, as the form of class society — that is, as the form of exploitation (slavery, feudalism, capitalism) — changes, so does the form of the relation between the ruler and the ruled. In other words, while the state’s basic role is to reproduce a class society and to serve its ruling class, the actual ways in which it executes its functions and relates to classes and class fractions are different in different class contexts. This difference is determined by the forms in which surplus is actually extracted,8 along with various empirical (i.e. time- and place-specific) conditions such as race, religion, caste, gender, environmental factors, the historical ‘survivals’ of a place, and geopolitics of a country, all of which are contingently, if not un-importantly, connected to the class context. Sometimes, the relation between the state and class will be a little more autonomous than in other societies (or contexts). In capitalist class society, the state does not ordinarily force members of the working class to work for this or that capitalist. It does not have to. Dispossessed of property, workers will be forced to work for a capitalist for a wage. This fact does not mean, however, what Eagleton thinks: ‘[T]he state under capitalism has more independence of class relations than it does under, say, feudalism’ (Eagleton, 2011: 205).9 To me, the state under capitalism is no more independent of class relations than it is in pre-capitalist societies. What is true is that ‘the state under capitalism has more independence’ vis-à-vis individuals/groups belonging to the capitalist class (or, occasionally, vis-à-vis short-term economic interests of the capitalist class as such). Indeed, one’s employer (or rentier or pawnshop owner) does not have to be a prime minister or an army general. But in pre-capitalist societies, where direct producers have control over their means of production, economic exploitation is more directly effected through political power (via decentralized form of state power), so the people who economically exploit tend to be those who have direct access to state power — they directly possess state’s coercive power. In Capital volume 3, Marx (1894) says that, in all societies, where ‘the direct labourer remains the “possessor” of the means of production and labour conditions necessary for the production of his own means of subsistence, the property relationship must simultaneously appear as a direct relation of lordship and servitude’. This means that ‘the direct producer is not free; a lack of freedom which may be reduced from serfdom with enforced labour to a mere tributary relationship’ (ibid.). According to Amin (2009: 222), developed precapitalist class societies took the form of tributary society. Feudalism is a specific type of tributary society, and slavery being an exception that existed in the interstices:”翻译为中文","completion":"拥有阶级 —— 地主贵族和资产阶级 —— 不仅通过财富的力量，通过简单的劳动剥削资本，也通过国家的力量 —— 通过军队、官僚机构、法院来使工人阶级处于奴役状态。 （引自马克思和恩格斯，1975：244；加粗部分） 因此，多数阶级（工人和小规模生产者）的奴役由两个相互联系的机制组成：拥有阶级（主要是资本家）的经济剥削和通过国家权力的政治征服。国家的权力，归根结底，是被剥削阶级的政治权力，或多或少，“是统治阶级最集中的力量”（托洛茨基，1977：122）： 【国家的】性质是政治的......，因为国家，作为权力的工具，是对经济基础的政治上层建筑的典型体现。但这种政治权力不仅用于“调节”政治事务，在狭义、技术意义上的词（即国家机构内部的事务），而且首先和主要是经济、文化、宗教和其他事务。 （同上） 国家权力必然是阶级权力的一种形式，即使国家权力的行使受国家内部结构和自私政客及官员利益的调解。即，这两种形式的权力之间的关系是内在的而不是外在的。国家权力，归根结底，是所有前社会主义阶级社会中剥削阶级的权力。因此，阶级关系如何影响国家以及相对自治的国家精英如何对阶级压力做出反应并按照自己的利益行动，都属于所谓的国家理论。 5 阶级社会和国家职能 国家有基本（主要）职能和非基本（次要）职能。在经济职能方面，国家试图确保拥有财产的阶级能够通过占有剩余劳动和其他方式（例如战争、殖民等）来增加其财产。马克思（1887：534）将国家的权力描述为一种经济权力，它试图“加速……封建生产方式向资本主义生产方式的转变”。在政治职能方面，这最终是主要职能，国家的角色是控制大众，如前所述。 然而，国家还执行许多次要任务，所以其任务不是完全代表经济上占主导地位的阶级。有一些政府必须执行的职能，以保持社会运转，无论它们是否对统治阶级有任何直接的特殊好处。这些包括：对抗大流行的措施；城市卫生；防范自然灾害；以及促进教育、文化和健康。一个特定的国家，拥有自己的地理边界，作为国家家庭的成员存在。作为一个“国家”国家，它管理其管辖范围内具有不同利益的统治阶层人民的共同事务，以对抗其他国家管辖范围内的竞争对手统治阶层。它帮助自己的统治阶层保持与竞争对手的竞争力。军事支出部分上是关于这一点。 此外，统治阶级本身充满了阶级内部的经济和其他冲突，因此国家不得不解决统治阶级内部的冲突。国家还必须解决直接生产者阶级内部的冲突。国家可能会执行有利于管理其事务的人的任务，即使它必须偶尔反对占主导地位的阶级： 政治国家的任务不仅仅是服务于统治阶级的直接利益。它还必须采取行动以保持社会凝聚力；尽管这两个目标最终是一致的，但在短期或中期内，它们之间可能存在尖锐冲突。 （伊格尔顿，2011：205） 国家的主要任务是国家存在的原因（即控制被剥削大众并再生产现有的阶级关系）。非基本任务更多的是政府职能而不是“国家性”的或与国家相关的：即使没有阶级划分，政府职能也将继续。因此，并非国家的每一个行动都被视为“必然直接符合统治阶级的集体利益”（Creaven，2000：192）。但当基本任务和非基本任务发生冲突时，后者将从属于基本任务。每当统治阶级的财产权受到严重威胁时，统治阶级的各个派系（及其政治代表）倾向于团结起来。国家帮助它们团结起来。它充当它们最大的商会或工会组织。正如萨特所说，“国家在统治阶级内部的冲突中构建了自己作为调解者，因为这些冲突有削弱它面对被统治阶级的风险”。 【国家】体现并实现了统治阶级的一般利益，超越了特定利益的对立和冲突。这相当于说统治阶级创造了它们的国家。 （萨特，1960：638） 即使国家执行其一般任务，这些任务也受其作为经济上占主导阶级的国家的阶级性质的影响而执行。正是因为如此，即因为国家主要是剥削阶级的国家，而剥削阶级在所有阶级社会中都是少数，有必要维持其阶级中立性。国家必须表现得超越社会之上，超越阶级之间和阶级内部的冲突之上。 国家的真正矛盾在于它是追求阶级目标的阶级工具，同时，它又将自己定位为所有人的主权统一体，即在绝对的另一个存在中，也就是民族。 （萨特，1960：642） 除了主要和次要任务之间的区别外，还有另一个区别需要作出：国家所做的事情和它决定不做的事情之间的辩证区别。在一个存在阶级划分（和阶级分派划分）的社会中，国家为一个阶级（或阶级分派）所做的事情相当于它不为对立的阶级（或对立的阶级分派）做任何事情。如果财产所有者因为反对剥削而殴打大众，而国家没有采取任何行动来阻止财产所有者，那么从一个角度来看，这意味着国家没有为大众做任何事情，它为统治阶级做了一些事情。从另一个角度来看，这也意味着国家为被剥削者做了一些事情：它确保了使他们继续被剥削和征服的条件。 6 阶级关系形式和阶级国家形式：一些历史例子 国家和阶级关系内在相关。随着阶级关系形式的变化，阶级国家的形式也随之变化，包括国家人员与统治阶级人员之间的结构重叠程度。 虽然基于“从实际生产者，即劳动者那里以各种方式......提取剩余劳动（马克思，1887：153）”的模式，阶级社会彼此不同，但所有形式的阶级社会共同的是剩余劳动被提取。剩余提取的前提是少数人有效控制财产，面对潜在和实际的被剥削者反对。没有国家这是不可能的。 正如提到的，只要存在阶级划分，国家就存在。而且，随着阶级社会的形式——即剥削形式（奴隶制、封建制、资本主义）——的变化，统治者与被统治者之间的关系也发生变化。换句话说，尽管国家的基本角色是再生产阶级社会并服务于其统治阶级，但它执行其职能的实际方式以及与阶级和阶级分派的关系在不同的阶级背景中是不同的。这种差异是由剩余实际提取的形式决定的，以及各种经验性（即时空特定）条件，如种族、宗教、种姓、性别、环境因素、一个地方的历史“残留物”和一个国家的地缘政治，所有这些都是与阶级背景相关的，尽管不是不重要的。有时，国家与阶级之间的关系在某些社会（或背景）中会比其他社会更有一些自治性。 在资本主义阶级社会中，国家通常不会强迫工人阶级为这个或那个资本家工作。它不需要这么做。被剥夺了财产，工人将被迫为资本家工作以换取工资。然而，这个事实并不意味着，正如伊格尔顿所想的那样：“在资本主义下的国家比在封建制下有更多的独立于阶级关系”（伊格尔顿，2011：205）。对我来说，资本主义下的国家并不比前资本主义社会更独立于阶级关系。真正的情况是，“资本主义下的国家有更多的独立性”相对于属于资本家阶级的个人/团体（或偶尔，相对于资本家阶级的短期经济利益）。确实，一个人的雇主（或房东或当铺老板）不必是总理或陆军将军。但在前资本主义社会中，直接生产者控制其生产资料，经济剥削更直接通过政治权力（通过分散形式的国家权力）来实施，因此从事经济剥削的人往往是那些直接接触国家权力的人——他们直接拥有国家的强制力量。 在《资本论》第三卷中，马克思（1894）说，在所有社会中，“直接劳动者仍然是‘拥有’生产自己生存资料所需的生产资料和劳动条件的‘拥有者’，财产关系必须同时表现为直接的统治和奴役关系”。这意味着“直接生产者不是自由的；这种缺乏自由可能从农奴制的强制劳动减少到仅仅的贡赋关系”（同上）。根据阿明（2009：222）的说法，发达的前资本主义阶级社会采取了封贡社会的形式。封建制是封贡社会的一种特定类型，而奴隶制则是存在于缝隙中的例外："},{"prompt":"请将“In the tributary stage, productive forces are developed beyond primitive communism, surplus labour extraction is controlled by the dominance of the superstructure within the context of an economy governed by usevalue, but there are market exchanges internally and externally (between localities and regions).10 In these societies, ‘the surplus product is . . . like a tribute paid to the exploiting class’, hence the name tributary mode (p. 227). The surplus is extracted on the basis of violence and religious ideologies (p. 229). In pre-capitalist societies, the personnel that manage the affairs of the state on behalf of what is the economically dominant class can overlap with those who are the exploiters: the state as such appears to be, and is, the appropriating class (in the tributary mode of production). Should the direct producers not be confronted by a private landowner, but rather, as in Asia, under direct subordination to a state which stands over them as their landlord and simultaneously as sovereign, then rent and taxes coincide, or rather, there exists no tax which differs from this form of ground-rent. (Marx, 1894: 576). ‘Under such circumstances’, then, Marx continues: there need exist no stronger political or economic pressure than that common to all subjection to that state. The state is then the supreme lord. Sovereignty here consists in the ownership of land concentrated on a national scale. But, on the other hand, no private ownership of land exists, although there is both private and common possession and use of land. (Marx, 1894: 576)11 The class process and the state process collapse then into one single process in a rather direct manner. What is effectively the economically dominant (exploiting) class is the collective of the people who manage the state. The rather direct relation, at the level of the structure, between the state and class relations, can be found in various regions of the pre-capitalist world at the level of the bearers of the structures. In ancient Greece, for example, the state was the direct appropriator of surplus-labour; this was indeed its essential function. . . . [T]he state was not simply a ‘third power’ designed to bring order to the class-struggle between appropriating and producing classes; nor was it even, as in a fully developed class-state, an instrument acting on behalf of an appropriating class but entering only indirectly into the process of class-exploitation. It was in effect the appropriating ‘class’, the direct master of a huge dependent labour-force. (Wood, 2012: 99) This meant that being a subject of state was also about being a dependent labourer, a servant, a serf (p. 100). So ‘public power, instituted to undertake socially necessary functions . . . has often been the original basis of the claim to and capacity for surplus appropriation’ (p. 294—5).12 A similar process appeared to be evident in ancient China. The Chinese imperial state reproduced, on a large scale, a pattern of state-formation that was probably more the rule than the exception in ‘high’ civilizations of the non-capitalist world: a bureaucratic hierarchy descending from a monarch to administrative districts governed by royal functionaries and fiscal officials, who extracted surplus-labour from subject villages of peasant producers for redistribution up the hierarchical chain. (Wood, 2012: 62-3) This was the case too in, for example, New kingdom of Egypt (the Egyptian empire), and the vast empire of Incas (ibid.). The close relationship between the state process and the class process existed in Europe, however unevenly. For example, in France, unlike England, ‘the centralized state appears to have developed (at least in large part) as a class-like phenomenon — that is, as an independent extractor of the surplus, in particular on the basis of its arbitrary power to tax the land’ (Brenner, 1985a/2005a: 55; italics added). Further: The state could develop . . . as a competitor with the lords, largely to the extent to which it could establish rights to extract the surplus of peasant production. It therefore had an interest in limiting the landlords’ rents so as to enable the peasants to pay more in taxes — and thus in intervening against the landlords to end peasant unfreedom and to establish and secure peasant property. (ibid.) The state machine then incorporated many landlords. The state as an independent class-like surplus extractor: this terminology is used by Brenner to stress ‘the novelty of the new form of centralized surplus extraction (tax/office) associated with the development of French absolutism and its conflict with the established decentralized form’ (i.e. serfdom or lordship) (ibid.: 59). Yet Brenner says that one should not over-emphasize ‘the points of separation and conflict between the systems of surplus extraction and between the monarchy and the aristocracy, and that it is important not to pass over the points of interconnection and inter-penetration’ and how ‘the rise of the one helped compensate for the decline of the other’ (Brenner, 1985b/2005b: 262—3, 288—9). In pre-capitalist India, there was also a very close and direct relation between the state process and class process. The Indus valley civilization, which existed about 5,000 years ago, had a well-developed class society. It comprised peasants, pastoral nomads, slaves, urban poor, artisans, merchants, priests, and rulers, along with their dependents such as warriors, scribes, and servants (Habib, 2016: 59). There was private property on a large scale in the Indus valley civilization (ibid.), especially in the cities. In fact, the Indus valley civilization was a city-based civilization. The existence of cities implied the existence of the state. Some people produced food (in rural areas), and others took it away. The state controlled the peasants whose surplus was extracted in the form of tax or tribute, without which the towns could not have existed. The Indus state was involved in war-making: it subjugated surrounding areas (Habib, 2016: 60). The state possessed armed means to subjugate other areas and to keep the subjugated population in check. It also used religion to legitimize authority. The Indus valley state kept the society together. It had a lot of administrative control over society as evident not only from the fact that it planned the layout of the towns with straight roads which were maintained well but also from the way in which it stopped building encroachment on the roads (Habib, 2016: 60). There was much institutional uniformity which would not be possible without centralized control. Such uniformity is evident from the standard system of weights, the use of administrative seals, standard size of bricks, and so on (Habib, 2016: 60). The state and class relations were closely inter-related in ancient India post the Indus valley civilization too. In what is known as early Vedic age (1500— 1000 BC), large herds of cattle were a kind of ‘capital’ from which the cultivators drew their animal power (Habib and Thakur, 2016: 12). ‘Those herds could also serve as a means by which surplus extracted out of agriculture was stored.’ Those who possessed the surplus were the rulers and priests, who later became Kshatriyas and Brahmans castes/varnas, who were the upper castes (Habib and Thakur, 2016: 12). In the late Vedic age, the increasing power of the king was reflected in the growth of a conventional assemblage of officials serving him, including army commander, tax collector, chamberlain, charioteer, paymaster, courier, and many others (Habib and Thakur, 2016: 44). The internal structure of the state was deeply hierarchical. For example, in terms of salary, the prime minister would be paid 48,000 panas (coins) per annum, and the staff of accountants and writers were paid 500 panas, thus giving the ratio of 96:1 (Thapar, 2000: 57). Such stratification was probably reflective of the stratification in the wider society. In the later period in ancient India (200 BC to 300 AD), there was property in land as well as in cattle (needed to draw water for irrigation and for ploughing). Property in land and cattle and whether labour was free or forced were the basis of class distinctions (Habib, 2013: 99). Major classes were ‘plough owners’ (the gentry) who lived ‘in houses’ and who got people to farm their land, and there were others such as peasants and unfree men and women serving as hired labourers who lived in huts and not houses (Habib, 2013: 99—100). Lower classes surrendered a large part of their surplus in the form of tax to the state and rent to the gentry. Talking about the state in ancient India as such, one of the most prominent historians of ancient India, Romila Thapar, says that ‘its purpose was to protect the people as well as the institutions of family and private property and to maintain law and order’ and that ‘this was the justification, in the main, for paying taxes to the state or to the king who symbolized the state’ (Thapar, 2000: 55). The state’s tax from the cultivators was 1/4th to 1/6th of the gross product, in addition to often-unpaid forced labour for collective purposes (ibid.: 57). The state ‘assigned different parts of its possessions to individual officials [e.g. commanders] and left it to them to collect whatever they could to maintain themselves and their retainers, while presumably delivering a contracted amount to the royal treasury’ (Habib, 2013: 102). A commander could hold a province in service tenure (i.e. to provide him with his own income and resources for maintaining his troops), and he could then sub-assign a village to one of his captains. This has been described as feudalism from above (Habib, 2013: 102). The rulers imposed a tribute on ordinary people in the form of agricultural produce and horses, cattle, and gold (Habib and Thakur, 2016: 15). The ruling and the warrior class enriched itself through tribute which was supplemented by booty (raids or fights for cattle from common people of alien groups or tribes) (Habib and Thakur, 2016: 15). In post-Vedic times, in Mughul India (early 1500s to mid-1800s), The land revenue . . . for particular territories was assigned by the Mughul emperor, by way of . . . temporary transferrable assignments . . . in lieu of salary to his military commanders and bureaucrats. The latter and the emperor comprised the ruling class. (Habib, 1995: 238) In this sense, tax and rent were one. ‘Every revenue-collection operation was a minor military expedition even in the usual routine of Mughal administration; at any time the countryside might seethe with discontent and rebellion as the pressure of demand became too heavy’ (Habib, 1995: 257). Zamindar’s (tax collector’s) formal share of the total surplus, including the allowance for collecting the revenue, was about 18%. It could be as high as 25% of the total revenue collected.”翻译为中文","completion":"在封贡阶段，生产力得到了超越原始共产主义的发展，剩余劳动的提取受到经济由使用价值支配的背景中超结构的支配控制，但内部和外部（在地区间）存在市场交换。 在这些社会中，“剩余产品……就像支付给剥削阶级的贡品”，因此得名为封贡生产方式（第227页）。剩余的提取是基于暴力和宗教意识形态（第229页）。 在前资本主义社会中，代表经济上占主导地位的阶级管理国家事务的人员可能与剥削者重叠：国家本身看起来，也是，占有阶级（在封贡生产方式中）。 如果直接生产者不是面对一个私人地主，而是如在亚洲，直接从属于一个兼作他们的地主和主权者的国家，那么租金和税收便合二为一，或者说，不存在与这种形式的地租不同的税收。 （马克思，1894：576）。 “在这种情况下”，马克思继续说： 没有比所有屈服于国家的共同政治或经济压力更强的必要了。国家是至高无上的统治者。这里的主权包括在国家层面集中的土地所有权。但另一方面，不存在私人土地所有权，尽管存在土地的私人和共同占有和使用。 （马克思，1894：576） 然后，阶级过程和国家过程直接合为一个过程。实际上是经济上占主导地位的（剥削）阶级是管理国家的人的集体。在结构层面，国家与阶级关系之间的相当直接关系可以在前资本主义世界的各个地区的结构载体中找到。 例如，在古希腊， 国家是剩余劳动的直接占有者；这正是其基本职能……【国家】不仅仅是一个“第三方势力”，旨在为占有阶级和生产阶级之间的阶级斗争带来秩序；它甚至不是，如在完全发达的阶级国家中，代表占有阶级利益的工具，而是间接进入阶级剥削过程。实际上它是占有的“阶级”，直接统治大量依赖的劳动力。 （伍德，2012：99） 这意味着成为国家的臣民也意味着成为一个依赖的劳动者，一个仆人，一个农奴（第100页）。因此，“建立来承担社会必要职能的公共权力……通常是对剩余占有权利主张和能力的最初基础”（第294-5页）。 在古代中国似乎也出现了类似的过程。 中国帝国国家在大规模上再现了一个国家形成模式，这个模式在非资本主义世界的“高度”文明中可能更多是规则而非例外：从君主到由王室官员和财政官员管理的行政区域的官僚等级制度，他们从农民生产者的从属村庄中提取剩余劳动，以便沿着等级链向上再分配。 （伍德，2012：62-3） 在埃及新王国（埃及帝国）和广袤的印加帝国也是如此（同上）。 在欧洲，国家过程和阶级过程之间的密切关系存在着，尽管不均匀。例如，在法国，不同于英格兰，“中央集权国家似乎已经发展成（至少在很大程度上）作为一个类似的现象——即作为一个独立的剩余提取者，特别是基于其征税的武断权力”（布伦纳，1985a/2005a：55；加粗部分）。此外： 国家可以发展……作为与领主的竞争者，主要是因为它能够建立提取农民生产剩余的权利。因此，它有兴趣限制地主的租金，以便农民能够支付更多的税——因此，它有干预地主的动机，终结农民的不自由并确立和保障农民财产。 （同上） 然后国家机器包含了许多地主。 国家作为一个独立的类似阶级的剩余提取者：布伦纳使用这个术语是为了强调与法国绝对主义发展相关的中央集权剩余提取（税收/官职）的新形式及其与既定的分散形式（即农奴制或领主制）的冲突的“新奇性”（同上：59）。然而布伦纳说，不应该过分强调剩余提取制度之间的分离和冲突点，以及君主制与贵族之间的冲突，重要的是不要忽视相互联系和相互渗透的点，以及“一个的崛起如何帮助弥补另一个的衰落”（布伦纳，1985b/2005b：262-3，288-9）。 在前资本主义的印度，国家过程和阶级过程之间也存在非常紧密和直接的关系。大约5000年前存在的印度河谷文明拥有发达的阶级社会。它包括农民、游牧民、奴隶、城市贫民、工匠、商人、祭司和统治者，以及他们的依赖者，如战士、文书和仆人（哈比卜，2016：59）。印度河谷文明存在大规模私有财产（同上），特别是在城市中。事实上，印度河谷文明是一个以城市为基础的文明。城市的存在意味着国家的存在。一些人在农村地区生产食物，而其他人则拿走食物。国家控制了农民，其剩余以税收或贡品的形式被提取，没有这些，城镇就无法存在。 印度国家参与了战争：它征服了周围地区（哈比卜，2016：60）。国家拥有征服其他地区和保持被征服人口处于控制状态的武装手段。它还利用宗教来合法化权威。印度河谷国家维持了社会的整体。它对社会拥有大量的行政控制，这不仅从它规划带有直道的镇区布局以及维护良好的道路，还从它阻止建筑侵占道路的方式中可见（哈比卜，2016：60）。有很多机构一致性，没有中央控制是不可能的。这种一致性从标准的衡量系统、行政印章的使用、砖块的标准尺寸等方面显而易见（哈比卜，2016：60）。 在古代印度的印度河谷文明之后，国家与阶级关系密切相关。在所谓的早期吠陀时代（公元前1500-1000年），大量的牛群是一种“资本”，农民从中获得了动物力量（哈比卜和塔库尔，2016：12）。 “那些牛群还可以作为一种手段，通过它农业中提取的剩余被储存。”拥有剩余的人是统治者和祭司，后来成为了刹帝利和婆罗门种姓/瓦尔纳，他们是上层种姓（哈比卜和塔库尔，2016：12）。 在晚吠陀时代，国王权力的增强体现在为他服务的官员的常规聚集上，包括军队指挥官、税收征集员、司库、马车夫、出纳员、信使和许多其他人（哈比卜和塔库尔，2016：44）。国家的内部结构深度等级制。例如，就工资而言，首相每年支付48,000帕纳（硬币），而会计和文书人员支付500帕纳，从而使比例为96:1（塔帕尔，2000：57）。这种分层可能反映了更广泛社会中的分层。 在古代印度的后期（公元前200年至公元300年），既有土地财产，也有牛群财产（用于提水灌溉和耕作）。土地和牛群的财产以及劳动是否自由或强制构成了阶级区别的基础（哈比卜，2013：99）。主要阶级是“拥有犁的人”（地主阶级），他们“住在房子里”，并让人们耕种他们的土地，还有其他人例如农民和不自由的男女担任雇佣劳动者，他们住在小屋而非房子里（哈比卜，2013：99-100）。下层阶级将大部分剩余以税收的形式上缴给国家，以及以租金的形式上缴给地主阶级。 关于古代印度国家本身，古印度最杰出的历史学家之一罗米拉·塔帕尔说：“其目的是保护人民以及家庭和私有财产制度，并维持法律和秩序”，这“主要是向国家或国王（象征国家）缴纳税收的理由”（塔帕尔，2000：55）。国家向农民征收的税收为总产量的1/4至1/6，此外还有通常未付的强迫劳动，用于集体目的（同上：57）。 国家“将其占有的不同部分分配给个别官员[例如指挥官]，让他们自行收集所能维持自身及其追随者的任何东西，同时按约定金额交付国库”（哈比卜，2013：102）。一个指挥官可以将一个省份作为服务土地（即为他提供自己的收入和维持部队的资源），然后他可以将一个村庄分配给他的一名队长。这被描述为自上而下的封建制（哈比卜，2013：102）。统治者通过农产品和马匹、牛群、黄金的形式向普通人征收贡品，通过这种贡品丰富了统治阶级和战士阶级，这还通过掠夺（从外族人或部落的普通人那里抢夺牛群的袭击或战斗）补充了战利品（哈比卜和塔库尔，2016：15）。 在莫卧儿印度时期（1500年代初到1800年代中期）， 地租……对特定领域由莫卧儿皇帝通过……临时可转让的分配……代替工资分配给他的军事指挥官和官僚。后者和皇帝构成了统治阶级。 （哈比卜，1995：238） 从这个意义上说，税收和租金合二为一。“每次征税操作都是一个小型军事行动，即使在莫卧儿行政的常规程序中；任何时候，当需求压力变得过重时，乡村都可能沸腾着不满和叛乱”（哈比卜，1995：257）。地主（税收征收者）的总剩余份额，包括收取税收的津贴，约为18%。这可能高达总收入的25%。"},{"prompt":"请将“7 Multiple state forms within given class forms As the form of class society changes, the nature of the state changes. If appropriation of surplus requires immediate coercion, there tends to be a greater degree of overlap between those who appropriate surplus and those who are in charge of coercion (state actors). In addition, each form of class society itself— slave-owning, feudal, capitalist society — presents ‘a mass of political forms’ (as well as ‘a variety of political doctrines, opinions and revolutions’), and ‘this extreme diversity and immense variety . . . can be understood only by firmly holding, as to a guiding thread, to this division of society into classes, this change in the forms of class rule’ (Lenin, 1919a). As the nature of class relation changes, the methods of violence also change: the weapons of violence correspond ‘to the technical level of the given epoch’ (ibid.). Consider the different forms ofthe pre-capitalist state, with respect to slavery: A monarchy is the power of a single person, a republic is the absence of any non-elected authority; an aristocracy is the power of a relatively small minority, a democracy is the power of the people. All these differences arose in the epoch of slavery. (Lenin, 1919a) And, with respect to feudalism: The change in the form of exploitation transformed the slave-owning state into the feudal state. This was of immense importance And here too the forms of state varied, here too we find both the monarchy and the republic, although the latter was much more weakly expressed. But always the feudal lord was regarded as the only ruler. The peasant serfs were deprived of absolutely all political rights. (ibid.) And the capitalist state forms can also be different. It can be, more or less, liberal democratic. Or it can be the fascistic state form which emerges due to the failure of the liberal democratic state form to defend the democratic rights of people and the failure of the capitalist system to meet the economic needs of the common people who suffer because of the crisis-ridden capitalist system that is supported by all forms of the capitalist state. Yet, in spite of different forms of the state not only across class societies but also within a class society, there is something common to them all. It is the class content of the state, as we have already seen. As Lenin (1919a) explains: The state is a machine for the oppression of one class by another, a machine for holding in obedience to one class other, subordinated classes. There are various forms of this machine. The slave-owning state could be a monarchy, an aristocratic republic or even a democratic republic. In fact the forms of government varied extremely, but their essence was always the same. Strictly speaking, class relations have the dominant, but not exclusive, influence on the state. Underlying the enormous difference in terms of state forms and functions, there is, of course, the difference in the form of class society in terms of say, the level of economic development with which class relations are closely related. The ways in which the appropriation of surplus product from direct producers occurs, i.e. class relations, can act as a fetter on the development of productive forces. At a more concrete level, the development of productive forces may be retarded by factors such as the lack of appropriate technology; ecologically sustainable interaction with, and control over, nature; and the availability of enough able-bodied people. The state is shaped by the relative economic backwardness — that is, relative to both what is needed to meet everyone’s needs, and relative to what is possible if class relations and other obstacles did not exist. So one must assess ‘the character of the state from the economic backwardness’ of a country (Trotsky, 1991: 49). In addition, while the state is heavily and fundamentally influenced by class relations, those who manage the affairs of the state can have a powerful and independent role. This is especially the case when there is a periodic equilibrium between classes: As Engels (1884: chapter 9) says, ‘By way of exception, . . . periods occur in which the warring classes balance each other so nearly that the state power as ostensible mediator acquires, for the moment, a certain degree of independence of both.’13 In certain historical conjunctures, once the state exists because of the antagonistic class relations, it can shape the evolution of the property-owning classes and strata and change the form of a class society: it can help create a new (proto) property-owning class (e.g. urban capitalists) from an old one (e.g. rural landlords). This process in which a state rooted in non-capitalist class relations promotes capitalism gives the false impression that the state is independent of class relations as such. The state — in terms of its existence as a structure of relations and in terms of actions of those who manage the state — is fundamentally shaped by class relations and economic conditions associated with class relations. Even while the state appears to act like the dominant class or appears to have created class relations, the fact of the matter is the following, and it bears repeating this point: The material life of individuals . . . is the real basis of the state and remained so at all the stages at which division of labor and private property [which are component aspects of class society] are still necessary. . . . These actual relations are in no way created by the state power; on the contrary they are the power creating it. The individuals who rule in these conditions — leaving aside the fact that their power must assume the form of the state — have to give their will, which is determined by these definite conditions, a universal expression as the will of the state, as law, an expression whose content is always determined by the relations of this class, as the civil and criminal law demonstrates in the clearest possible way. (Marx and Engels, 1845; italics added) No matter how important the state is, the fundamental cause of society’s problems is not in the state, because the state itself is rooted in class relations. Marx (1875) in his Critique of the Gotha programme is critical of anyone who instead of treating existing society (and this holds good for any future one) as the basis of the existing state (or of the future state in the case of future society), . . . treats the state rather as an independent entity that possesses its own intellectual, ethical, and libertarian bases. 8 Summary, and theoretical and political implications The existence of the state is rooted in the economic basis of society, including, especially in its class relations. In the materialist-dialectical approach to the class-state outlined earlier, there are multiple inversions which indicate that certain approaches have primacy over other approaches. (a) A process view of the state must have primacy over a view of the state that treats it merely as a thing (e.g. apparatuses). The state (as a set of apparatuses) is a process of the masses being kept in check in the interest of the exploited class. (b) The state must be seen above all as an objective reality: its objective aspects must have primacy over the subjective aspects (how it is perceived). Once again, the state continually evolves ‘out of the life-process of definite individuals, but of individuals, not as they may appear in their own or other people’s imagination, but as they . . . produce materially’ (Marx and Engels, 1845). (c) Among the objective aspects, it is the economic factors (production and exchange) that are more important than non-economic (e.g. political) factors. But it is not enough to say that the state is shaped by the economic sphere (or civil society or the sphere where people pursue their own interests). (d) The economic sphere must be immediately seen as a site of class relations involving private property and exploitation over other relations (including individual actions), and the class relations have a determining role, and this means that the state is basically the state of the economically dominant class and not of the exploited classes. The state must be seen at the level of private property and appropriation of surplus labour/ product, that is, at the level of class relations. The relation between the state and class relations has different elements: the political oppression of the masses as an element of their class experience is shaped by the class-exploitation element of class experience.14 The latter is not possible without the property relations element.15 The exploitation aspect of class and its oppression (political subjugation) aspect prompt, and are mediated by, class struggle. A basic problem of production in a class society is how to extract surplus product: the exploited tends to resist not only the fact that they do not control property but also the fact that they have to perform surplus labour which does not benefit them but which benefits another class.16 Economic exploitation is a coercive affair, and means of coercion are ultimately in the hands of the state. Exploitation (along with the separation of workers from means of production and subsistence) compels the exploited class to resist and revolt against the exploiter class, so political oppression is simultaneously necessary. It is not an epiphenomenon. Political power is an essential aspect of class relation. Indeed, the state is a product, and an expression, of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. The state arises where, when, and insofar as class antagonism objectively cannot be reconciled. The existence of the state proves that the class antagonisms are irreconcilable. If the state just existed and impacted class relations and all classes, without it having to necessarily protect the fundamental interests of the exploiting class as against that of other classes, then people could fight against class exploitation and significantly reduce the problems caused by class relations. If class relations were merely about economic exploitation of the majority by a tiny minority with its control over property, then people’s economic struggle against the property-owning class could diminish, durably and significantly, the adverse effects of class relations. And such a struggle, with some difficulty perhaps, could even remove the structure of class relations. In fact, the belief that such a thing is possible is at the heart of much of the Marxist and ‘progressive’ thinking about class and the state. Such a view is mistaken. Against this, the approach to the state that I defend here is that in the history of class society, a time comes when to remove the structure of class relations, one must remove the state, without which class structure — including private property relations — cannot exist and cannot be reproduced. It is therefore worth reiterating that the direct producers are not just economically exploited and excluded from control over private property; they are also simultaneously politically oppressed or subjugated. They lack control over state power, which is mainly its coercive power. They are powerless in two senses therefore: economic and political.”翻译为中文","completion":"7 在给定阶级形式中的多种国家形态 随着阶级社会形式的变化，国家性质也随之变化。如果剩余价值的占有需要直接的强制，那么占有剩余价值者和负责强制的人（国家行为者）之间往往存在更大程度的重叠。此外，每种阶级社会形式本身——奴隶制、封建制、资本主义社会——都呈现出“大量政治形式”（以及“各种政治学说、观点和革命”），“这种极端的多样性和巨大的多样性......只有通过坚持社会分为阶级的划分，以及阶级统治形式的变化作为一条指引线，才能理解”（列宁，1919a）。随着阶级关系性质的变化，暴力的方式也随之变化：暴力手段与“给定时代的技术水平相符”（同上）。 考虑前资本主义国家的不同形式，关于奴隶制： 君主制是单一人的权力，共和制是不存在任何非民选权威的状态；贵族制是相对较少的少数人的权力，民主制是人民的权力。所有这些差异都产生于奴隶制的时代。 （列宁，1919a） 关于封建制： 剥削形式的变化将奴隶主所有制国家转变为封建国家。这一点极为重要。而在这里 国家形式也同样多样，这里同样既有君主制也有共和制，尽管后者表达得更弱。但总是将封建领主视为唯一的统治者。农奴被剥夺了绝对所有的政治权利。 （同上） 资本主义国家形式也可以不同。它可以或多或少是自由民主的。或者，当自由民主国家形式无法捍卫人民的民主权利，以及资本主义体系无法满足因危机四伏的资本主义体系而受苦的普通人的经济需求时，就会出现法西斯国家形式，所有形式的资本主义国家都支持这一体系。然而，尽管国家形式不仅在不同的阶级社会中而且在一个阶级社会内部也不同，它们都有一个共同点。那就是国家的阶级内容，正如我们已经看到的。正如列宁（1919a）解释的那样： 国家是一个阶级由另一个阶级进行压迫的机器，是一个机器，用于使其他被统治的阶级保持服从。国家机器有多种形式。奴隶主所有制国家可以是君主制，贵族共和国甚至是民主共和国。事实上，政府形式变化极端，但其本质始终相同。 严格来说，阶级关系对国家有主导作用，但不是唯一作用。在国家形式和职能的巨大差异背后，当然有阶级社会形式的差异，例如与阶级关系密切相关的经济发展水平。直接生产者被提取剩余产品的方式，即阶级关系，可能成为生产力发展的阻碍。在更具体的层面上，生产力的发展可能因缺乏适当技术；与自然生态可持续的互动和控制；以及足够工作人口的可用性而受到阻碍。国家受相对经济落后性的影响——即相对于满足所有人需求所需的水平，以及如果不存在阶级关系和其他障碍将可能实现的水平。因此，必须从一个国家的经济落后性来评估“国家的性质”（托洛茨基，1991：49）。 此外，虽然国家在很大程度上受阶级关系的根本影响，但管理国家事务的人可以有强大且独立的作用。特别是当阶级之间存在周期性平衡时：如恩格斯（1884：第9章）所说，“例外情况下，出现了交战阶级相互平衡得如此接近，以致国家权利作为表面调停者在某一时刻获得了对双方一定程度的独立。” 在某些历史关键时刻，一旦国家因敌对阶级关系而存在，它就可以塑造资产阶级和阶级和改变阶级社会的形式：它可以帮助创造一个新的（原型）拥有财产的阶级（例如城市资本家）从旧的一个（例如农村地主）。国家根植于非资本主义阶级关系促进资本主义的过程给人一种虚假印象，即国家独立于阶级关系。 国家——就其作为关系结构的存在以及管理国家的人的行为而言——根本上受阶级关系和与阶级关系相关的经济条件的影响。即使国家看似行为像统治阶级或似乎创造了阶级关系，事实是以下内容，值得重申这一点： 个体的物质生活......是国家的真实基础，并且在分工和私有财产[这些是阶级社会的组成方面]仍然必要的所有阶段上如此......这些实际关系绝非由国家权力创造；相反，它们是创造它的力量。 在这些条件下统治的个体——撇开他们的权力必须采取国家形式的事实不谈——必须给予他们的意志，这由这些特定条件决定，作为国家的意志，作为法律，表达其内容始终由这个阶级的关系决定，如民法和刑法以最清晰的方式所示。 （马克思和恩格斯，1845；加粗部分） 不管国家有多重要，社会问题的根本原因不在于国家，因为国家本身根植于阶级关系。马克思（1875）在他的《哥达纲领批判》中批评任何人 而不是将现存社会（对任何未来社会同样适用）作为现存国家（或未来社会的未来国家）的基础，......反而将国家视为独立实体，拥有自己的智力、道德和自由基础。 8 总结及理论和政治含义 国家的存在植根于社会的经济基础，尤其是在其阶级关系中。在本文早前概述的关于阶级国家的唯物辩证方法中，有多个反转，表明某些方法优先于其他方法。 (a) 对国家的过程视角必须优先于仅将国家视为事物（例如机构）的视角。国家（作为一套机构）是一个过程，其中大众保持在剥削阶级利益中被管控。 (b) 国家必须首先被视为客观现实：其客观方面必须优先于主观方面（如何被感知）。再次，国家不断地“从特定个体的生命过程中进化，但是这些个体不是根据他们自己或其他人的想象中的样子，而是根据他们......物质生产”（马克思和恩格斯，1845）。 (c) 在客观方面中，经济因素（生产和交换）比非经济（例如政治）因素更重要。但是仅仅说国家受经济领域（或民间社会或人们追求自己利益的领域）的影响是不够的。 (d) 经济领域必须立即被视为涉及私有财产和剥削的阶级关系的场所，优于其他关系（包括个体行动），阶级关系具有决定性作用，这意味着国家基本上是经济上占主导地位的阶级的国家，而不是被剥削阶级的国家。必须在私有财产和剩余劳动/产品的占有层面，即阶级关系层面上看待国家。 国家与阶级关系之间的关系包含不同要素：大众作为阶级经验的一个要素所受的政治压迫是由阶级剥削要素所塑造的。后者没有财产关系要素是不可能的。阶级的剥削方面和压迫（政治征服）方面促使并通过阶级斗争进行调解。在阶级社会中生产的基本问题是如何提取剩余产品：被剥削者不仅抗拒他们无法控制财产的事实，还抗拒他们必须进行的剩余劳动——这种劳动并不使他们受益，而是使另一个阶级受益。经济剥削是一项强制活动，强制手段最终掌握在国家手中。剥削（连同将工人与生产资料和生存手段分离）迫使被剥削阶级抵抗并反抗剥削阶级，因此同时需要政治压迫。这不是附带现象。政治权力是阶级关系的本质方面。事实上，国家是阶级对立不可调和性的产物和表达。国家出现在哪里，何时，以及在多大程度上，是因为阶级对立客观上无法调和。国家的存在证明了阶级对立是不可调和的。 如果国家只是存在并影响了阶级关系及所有阶级，而不必然保护剥削阶级的根本利益而不是其他阶级的利益，那么人们可以对抗阶级剥削并显著减少阶级关系引起的问题。如果阶级关系仅仅涉及到经济剥削，即少数控制财产的人剥削广大多数人，那么人们对抗拥有财产阶级的经济斗争可以减少阶级关系的不利影响，持久且显著。而这种斗争，也许有些困难，甚至可以消除阶级关系的结构。事实上，这种可能性是许多马克思主义和“进步”思想关于阶级和国家的核心。这种观点是错误的。相反，我在这里捍卫的对国家的看法是，在阶级社会的历史中，存在这样一个时刻，为了消除阶级关系的结构，必须消除国家，否则阶级结构——包括私有财产关系——无法存在和再生产。因此，值得重申，直接生产者不仅在经济上被剥削和排除在对私有财产的控制之外；他们同时在政治上被压迫或征服。他们缺乏对国家权力的控制，这主要是其强制力量。因此，他们在两个方面无力：经济和政治。"},{"prompt":"请将“The property question is then absolutely crucial to the state question. Marx (1847) says: The question of property, depending on the different levels of development of industry, has always been the vital question for a particular class. In the 17th and 18th centuries, when the point at issue was the abolition offeudal property relations, the question of property was the vital question for the bourgeois class. In the 19th century, when it is a matter of abolishing bourgeois property relations, the question of property is a vital question for the working class. The state’s major task is to defend exploitative property rights. So the following statement from Resnick and Wolff, two post-modernist Marxists, does not make sense: To own property in a particular society need not empower the owner to employ another human being or to participate in state decisions; that would depend, for example, on ideological and political conditions in that society. To be propertyless need not require a person to sell labor power; that would depend, for example, on whether propertyless persons had socially recognized access to income from other sources [such as the state]. (Resnick and Wolff, 2006: 119) Therefore, the authors argue, ‘To wield state powers of all sorts need not require ownership of property; that would depend on the social rules whereby power is granted to individuals’ (ibid.). It is true that whether a given propertyless person must sell labour power would depend on whether he/she has socially recognized access to income from sources such as state, but if the state provided adequate means of subsistence to all propertyless, would there be class relations of any sort? And if the state does not and cannot do so, then the question is, why not? The class nature of the state is attested not by the fact that every act is exclusively in the direct interest of the ruling class only, but by the fact that all other interests are, more or less regularly, subordinated to the interests of the ruling class, that the acts of the state are decisively shaped by what the ruling class and its political representatives take its interests to be. Acts of the state take place only within the framework of the interests of the ruling class. It is important to recognize the similarities between the capitalist state and pre-capitalist-type states in order to understand the relatively autonomous role of the capitalist state and its actors. Without doing that how would one understand the independent role of the czarist state in Russia or the state in Japan where the samurai, the hereditary military nobility and officer caste, and warriors of medieval and early modern Japan ‘had to create capitalism and a capitalist class of which they could be part’ (Ollman, 2003: 200; italics added)? If they were independent of class relations as such, why did they not create a socialist state? The state is affected by numerous processes in a class society. It is affected by the changing balance of power of the basic classes, that is, by class struggle, which often coexists with other kinds of struggles such as ecological and anti-oppression struggles. The state is affected by the need to sustain class exploitation and wealth accumulation in the hands of property owners, by external threats to a society, by the autonomous interests of state officials/ politicians, by the need to intervene on behalf of society as a whole (clearing forests, making roads, providing for people during a pandemic or natural calamity, or checking excessive environmental damage), and by the contradiction between productive forces and relations leading to the crisis of production — all within the limits of the class logic of the state, that is, the need to suppress the direct producers and reproduce exploitative private property rights. Engels (1886) says that ‘the will of the state is, on the whole, deter-mined . . . in the last resort, by the development of the productive forces and relations of exchange’. The emphasis on the class character of the state means that the state actually has a dual function. It defends the structure of class relations and the effects of class relations. That is, it defends private property and exploitation, and it also defends the inequality in consumption and income, which is dominantly caused by private property and exploitation. This under-stressed aspect of the state (i.e. the relation between the state and inequality), along with the fact that, as Engels says, the state is affected by the level of the development of productive forces, has an implication for understanding the post-capitalist transitional state, revealing a potential limitation in Lenin’s thinking. Trotsky (1991: 45—6) wrote in Revolution betrayed: A socialist state even in America, on the basis of the most advanced capitalism, could not immediately provide everyone with as much as he needs, and would therefore be compelled to spur everyone to produce as much as possible. The duty of the stimulator in these circumstances naturally falls to the state, which in its turn cannot but resort, with various changes and mitigations, to the method of labor payment worked out by capitalism. It was in this sense that Marx wrote in 1875: ‘Bourgeois law . . . is inevitable in the first phase of the communist society, in that form in which it issues after long labor pains from capitalist society. Law can never be higher than the economic structure and the cultural development of society conditioned by that structure.’ Trotsky continues, now referring to Lenin: In explaining these remarkable lines [from Marx], Lenin adds: ‘Bourgeois law in relation to the distribution of the objects of consumption assumes, of course, inevitably a bourgeois state, for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of compelling observance of its norms. It follows (we are still quoting Lenin) that under Communism not only will bourgeois law survive for a certain time, but also even a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie!’ To the extent that the state has important economic functions in all societies, it will, more or less, have those functions in the transitional society too. Trotsky (1991: 46—7) explains in Revolution betrayed: Insofar as the state which assumes the task of socialist transformation is compelled to defend inequality—that is, the material privileges ofa minority— by methods of compulsion, insofar does it also remain a ‘bourgeois’ state, even though without a bourgeoisie. These words contain neither praise nor blame; they name things with their real name. . . It is because Lenin, in accord with his whole intellectual temper, gave an extremely sharpened expression to the conception of Marx, that he revealed the source of the future difficulties, his own among them, although he did not himself succeed in carrying his analysis through to the end. ‘A bourgeois state without a bourgeoisie’ proved inconsistent with [the principle of] genuine Soviet democracy. The relation between the state and inequality in consumption is an important matter. ‘The dual function of the state’, that is, the protection of specific property relations and regulation of inequalities, ‘could not but affect its structure’, as revealed by the experience of 1917, which ‘theory was unable clearly to foresee’. If for the defence of socialized property against bourgeois counterrevolution a ‘state of armed workers’ was fully adequate, it was a very different matter to regulate inequalities in the sphere of consumption. Those deprived of property are not inclined to create and defend it. The majority cannot concern itself with the privileges of the minority. For the defence of ‘bourgeois law’ the workers’ state was compelled to create a ‘bourgeois’ type of instrument — that is, the same old gendarme, although in a new uniform. (Trotsky, 1991: 47) Then, apart from the matter of consumption inequality, there is the matter concerning the low level of the development of productive forces as such. The state must promote the development of productive forces (either for ‘society as a whole’ or in the interest of the economically dominant class). What happens if the private property is overthrown, but the low level of the development of productive forces exists in part because of isolatedness of the revolutionary transition and attendant bureaucratism within the post-revolution society, constituting a form of ‘combined development’ where advanced social relations (that is, relations indicating transition to socialism) coexist with relatively backward level of economic development and common people not enjoying an adequate amount of means of subsistence? It is not just private property relations that explain the nature of the state. Relative economic backwardness can also contribute to the state’s continued reproduction. This is a theme that has been relatively neglected, including by Lenin. Basing himself wholly upon the Marxian theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Lenin did not succeed . . . in drawing all the necessary conclusions as to the character of the state from the economic backwardness and isolatedness of the country. Explaining the revival of bureaucratism by the unfamiliarity of the masses with administration and by the special difficulties resulting from the war, the program [i.e. Lenin’s socialist programme) prescribes merely political measures for the overcoming of ‘bureaucratic distortions’: elections and recall at any time of all plenipotentiaries, abolition of material privileges, active control by the masses, etc. It was assumed that along this road the bureaucrat, from being a boss, would turn into a simple and moreover temporary technical agent, and the state would gradually and imperceptibly disappear from the scene. (Trotsky, 1991: 49-0; italics added) There are some practical implications of the class theory of the state. One is that as long as class relations exists, the state, the main task of which is the political subjugation of the masses, will exist. So the overthrow of class relations, including property relations, and the overthrow of the existing state are a necessary condition for a classless and stateless society. There is another implication which is connected to the last one. If the state arose with class divisions and if therefore there was no state in the original (‘primitive’) classless society, that means that people can manage their affairs without the state in a future society which is classless and which is economically much more developed than any form of society in the present or in the past. For Engels, the possibility revealed by the gentile constitution was a major guarantee that the Marxist vision of the withering away of the State in a future communist society was not a recipe for chaos, as was argued by his opponents. (Bloch, 1983: 82) Yet historical experience has shown that in the post-1917 societies, the state remained a very powerful agent vis-à-vis ordinary people. As we have seen, this can be explained on the basis of the class theory of the state.17 ”翻译为中文","completion":"7 在特定的阶级形式中存在多种国家形态 随着阶级社会的形式变化，国家的性质也随之改变。如果剩余价值的占有需要直接强制，那么占有剩余价值的人和负责强制的人（国家行为者）之间往往会有更大程度的重叠。此外，每一种阶级社会形态本身——奴隶制、封建制、资本主义社会——都呈现出“大量的政治形式”（以及“各种政治学说、观点和革命”），“这种极端的多样性和巨大的多样性......只有通过坚持将社会分为阶级的划分，以及阶级统治形式的变化作为指导线索，才能得以理解”（列宁，1919a）。随着阶级关系性质的变化，暴力的方法也发生变化：暴力武器“对应于给定时代的技术水平”（同上）。 考虑前资本主义国家的不同形式，关于奴隶制： 君主制是一人的权力，共和制是没有任何非民选权威的状态；贵族制是相对较少的少数人的权力，民主制是人民的权力。所有这些差异都出现在奴隶制时代。 （列宁，1919a） 关于封建制： 剥削形式的变化将奴隶制国家转变为封建国家。这是极其重要的。而在这里，国家形式也不同，这里同样存在君主制和共和制，尽管后者表达得相对较弱。但封建领主总是被视为唯一的统治者。农奴被完全剥夺了所有政治权利。 （同上） 资本主义国家形式也可能不同。它可以是自由民主的，也可能是因自由民主国家形式无法捍卫人民的民主权利，以及资本主义体系无法满足因资本主义危机体系支持下受苦的普通人的经济需求而出现的法西斯主义国家形式。然而，尽管国家形式不仅在不同的阶级社会中而且在一个阶级社会内部也不同，它们都有一个共同点。那就是国家的阶级内容，正如我们已经看到的。正如列宁（1919a）解释的那样： 国家是一个阶级由另一个阶级进行压迫的机器，是一个机器，用于使其他被统治的阶级保持服从。国家机器有多种形式。奴隶主所有制国家可以是君主制，贵族共和制，甚至是民主共和制。事实上，政府形式变化极端，但其本质始终如一。 严格讲，阶级关系对国家有主导作用，但不是唯一作用。在国家形式和职能的巨大差异背后，当然存在阶级社会形式的差异，例如经济发展水平，与阶级关系密切相关。直接生产者被提取剩余产品的方式，即阶级关系，可以成为生产力发展的阻碍。在更具体的层面上，生产力的发展可能受到适当技术的缺乏、与自然的生态可持续互动和控制的缺失，以及足够劳动能力人口的缺乏等因素的阻碍。国家受相对经济落后性的影响 —— 即相对于满足所有人需求所需的水平，以及如果不存在阶级关系和其他障碍将可能实现的水平。因此，必须从一个国家的经济落后性评估“国家的性质”（托洛茨基，1991：49）。 此外，虽然国家在极大程度上受阶级关系的根本影响，但管理国家事务的人可以有独立和强大的作用。这特别是在阶级之间存在周期性平衡时的情况：正如恩格斯（1884：第9章）所说，“例外情况下……出现交战阶级彼此相互抗衡，使得国家权力作为表面调解者在某种程度上独立于双方。” 在某些历史节点上，一旦国家因敌对阶级关系而存在，它就可以塑造产权阶级和阶层的演变并改变阶级社会的形式：它可以帮助创造一个新的（原型）产权阶级（例如城市资本家）从旧的一个（例如乡村地主）。国家扎根于非资本主义阶级关系中促进资本主义的过程，给人一种虚假印象，即国家独立于阶级关系本身。 国家——就其作为关系结构的存在以及管理国家的人的行动而言——根本上受阶级关系和与阶级关系相关的经济条件的影响。即使国家看似像占主导地位的阶级行动，或看似创造了阶级关系，事实是以下内容，并且值得重申这一点： 个体的物质生活......是国家的真实基础，在劳动分工和私有财产[这些是阶级社会的组成部分]仍然必要的所有阶段上如此......这些实际关系绝不是由国家权力创造的；相反，它们是创造它的力量。 在这些条件下统治的个体——撇开他们的权力必须采取国家形式的事实不谈——必须给他们的意志，这是由这些特定条件决定的，作为国家的意志，作为法律，一个表达，其内容始终由这个阶级的关系决定，正如民法和刑法以最清晰的方式所示。 （马克思和恩格斯，1845；加粗部分） 不管国家有多重要，社会问题的根本原因不在于国家，因为国家本身根植于阶级关系。马克思（1875）在其《哥达纲领批判》中批评了任何 而不是将现存社会（以及对任何未来社会同样适用）作为现存国家（或未来社会的未来国家）的基础，……反而将国家视为一个独立的实体，拥有自己的智力、伦理和自由基础。"},{"prompt":"CASE AUTH/3741/2/23 COMPLAINANT v PFIZER Promotional Use of Twitter CASE SUMMARY This case concerned a complaint received in February 2023 about a tweet posted by a US employee of Pfizer, and re-tweeted by a senior UK employee in November 2020. The tweet, which was still visible on their Twitter feed, related to a Pfizer and BioNTech press release announcing the conclusion of the Phase 3 Study of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which had met all primary efficacy endpoints. The complainant alleged the tweet included relative efficacy rates without any information about absolute efficacy rates and that no safety data or safety information was provided, and therefore that Pfizer had misleadingly and illegally promoted its COVID-19 vaccine. The Panel ruled a breach of the following Clauses of the 2019 Code: Breach of Clause 2 Bringing discredit upon, and reducing confidence in, the pharmaceutical industry Breach of Clause 3.1 Promoting an unlicensed medicine Breach of Clause 7.2 Making a misleading claim Breach of Clause 7.9 Making claims that did not reflect the available evidence regarding possible adverse reactions Breach of Clause 9.1 Failing to maintain high standards This summary is not intended to be read in isolation. For full details, please see the full case report below. FULL CASE REPORT A complaint was received from a contactable member of the public about Pfizer. COMPLAINT The complainant stated that they had written to the PMCPA on numerous occasions to complain about Pfizer’s misuse of social media to misleadingly and illegally promote their covid vaccine. The complainant further stated that in some previous cases Pfizer had attempted to defend or mitigate their offences by reference to their desire to maintain high standards and also citing the various processes, procedures and training they had in place to prevent such occurrences. 2 However, the complainant alleged that it turned out that such misbehaviour was even more widespread than they had thought, extended right to the top of their UK operation and was apparently continuing to this very day. It had just been brought to the complainant’s attention that the attached tweet was re-tweeted by a Pfizer senior employee. It was re-tweeted using their Twitter account, the profile of which described the employee as a senior Pfizer UK employee. Two claims were made regarding the efficacy of their vaccine, both of which referred to relative efficacy rates without any information about absolute efficacy rates. The complainant stated the PMCPA had found such omissions relating to public discussion of covid vaccine efficacy to be in breach of the code on several previous occasions and so they thought it was clear that similar breaches had also taken place here. Furthermore, there was no mention of, or reference to, any safety data or safety information relating to this vaccine. They therefore thought that previous PMCPA findings of breaches relating to lack of balance and lack of safety information were relevant for this case too. The complainant stated that they realised that this tweet and re-tweet occurred over two years ago but felt it was still important to complain about it for two main reasons: 1. It was a tweet posted by a very senior member of the Pfizer development team which was then re-tweeted by a senior Pfizer UK employee. Previous claims by Pfizer that high standards were always maintained, that there was adequate training to prevent such occurrences, and that previous offences were just one-offs, were not supported by the behaviour demonstrated here. The complainant reminded the PMCPA that one of the previous cases of similar breaches involved a senior employee in Pfizer’s vaccine business. 2. The PMCPA had previously used the phrase ‘unique circumstances’ to describe the conditions prevailing during the pandemic as an excuse to mitigate findings against Pfizer. The complainant’s response had been to say that in such circumstances the public had a right to expect higher, not lower, standards from the pharmaceutical industry. This case illustrated yet again, not only the low standards prevailing at that time, but when viewed in the context of the previous findings against Pfizer, suggested a determined, coordinated and concerted effort to use the internet and social media to actively promote their covid vaccine misleadingly and in advance of the issue of any licence or approval. Furthermore, although the post was tweeted and re-tweeted over two years ago, it was still available to read on the Pfizer UK senior employee’s twitter feed. Since that time there had been numerous findings against Pfizer (and AstraZeneca) for misuse of the internet and social media to promote covid vaccines. In the circumstances the complainant thought that the British public had the right to expect Pfizer UK to have conducted some sort of audit of its social media accounts (at least of its significant accounts, amongst which they would include its UK senior employees) to ensure that anything which was similarly in breach of the code was removed - even to the extent of deleting accounts if necessary. This clearly was not done. Therefore, in light of all of the above, they thought the Panel would also agree that all these acts of commission and omission with regard to the code justified further findings of failure to maintain high standards (Clause 5.1) and also bringing discredit upon your industry (Clause 2). 3 When writing to Pfizer, the Authority asked it to consider the requirements of Clauses 2, 5.1, 6.1, 6.4 and 11.1 of the 2021 Code. RESPONSE Pfizer stated that it took its commitment to the Code extremely seriously and had conducted a thorough investigation and its response to the complainant’s allegations was set out below. Background information on the original tweet and re-tweet: Pfizer stated that the original post that had been identified by the complainant was posted in November 2020 by a Pfizer colleague based in the US. The US Pfizer colleague was now retired but at the time of issuing the tweet was employed within the area of Pfizer responsible for the clinical development of Pfizer’s pipeline and regulatory affairs in respect of such pipeline. They posted the Tweet on the day that Pfizer and BioNTech issued a press release announcing the conclusion of the Phase 3 Study of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which had met all primary efficacy endpoints. The original purpose of the tweet was therefore to recognise an important step in Pfizer and BioNTech’s efforts to bring forward a potential COVID-19 vaccine. It was not intended to be promotional in nature. It contained a statement of fact of the efficacy endpoints of the study. It made clear that the data would then be submitted to the health authorities and did not make any suggestion or inference about future availability for the general public or potential impact of the vaccine on the course of the pandemic. It expressed gratitude to the clinical trial volunteers and all others who were fighting the pandemic. The original post was not specifically directed at a UK audience and did not make any reference to the availability or use of the Pfizer vaccine candidate in the UK and was therefore not in scope of the ABPI Code of Practice. As highlighted by the complainant, a Pfizer UK colleague then re-tweeted the post creating a UK nexus thus bringing the re-tweet into scope of the ABPI Code of Practice (copy provided). The colleague whose re-tweet was the subject of this complaint was an infrequent user of Twitter having made only 21 tweets and replies and 31 likes since opening their account in June 2019. As of today, the colleague had 321 followers the majority of whom are professional individuals involved in, or with an interest in, the UK healthcare and research sector. The colleague’s followers are not however, limited to only UK health professionals and other relevant decision makers. Accuracy and balance of claims (Clauses 6.1, 6.4) and promotion prior to marketing authorisation (Clause 11.1) Pfizer stated that in re-tweeting the post, there was no intent by the UK colleague to promote or to advertise the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate. On being made aware of the complaint the colleague had no recollection of re-tweeting the post and could only assume that they had posted the re-tweet in error. Notwithstanding the original purpose of the tweet or the circumstances of the re-tweet both the colleague and Pfizer recognised that the re-tweet did not meet the requirements of the Code and as such Pfizer accepted breaches of Clauses 6.1, 6.4 and 11.1. 4 Maintenance of high standards (Clause 5.1) Contrary to the complainant’s allegation, this Twitter post was re-tweeted in error and was absolutely not part of a coordinated effort by Pfizer UK to use social media to actively promote the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Pfizer UK had a comprehensive policy on personal use of social media in relation to Pfizer’s business (copy provided) which prohibited colleagues from interacting with any social media related to Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines. The policy was supported by an interactive training module including a knowledge check (copy provided) and a one-page quick reference guide (copy provided). The colleague whose re-tweet was the subject of this complaint had completed the social media training module in October 2019. Throughout the pandemic Pfizer also ensured that briefings to colleagues informing them of newsworthy company updates related to the vaccine also included a reminder of the key elements of the Pfizer UK social media policy (copy provided). Subsequent to the Twitter activity that was the subject of this complaint, Pfizer received three complaints and associated rulings of breaches of the Code for individual colleagues’ use of LinkedIn in relation to Pfizer’s COVID-19 Vaccine trial results and the UK regulatory approval of the vaccine. As part of Pfizer’s corrective and preventative action plan associated with those complaints, the social media policy and training was further enhanced to provide additional clarification and all colleagues completed the enhanced training in September 2021. Pfizer’s one-page quick reference guide was refreshed and a COVID-19-specific one-page quick reference guide was also created (copy provided). In parallel with the retraining, all UK based colleagues were instructed to review any social media posts that they might have issued, shared or liked that related to Pfizer’s business and to remove any activity that they were not confident met all the requirements of Pfizer’s social media policy and therefore the Code (copy provided). Pfizer believed that these interventions, taken at a time when there was significant interest amongst the media and general public regarding Pfizer and BioNTech’s efforts to develop a vaccine, represent a responsible and comprehensive approach to social media. Pfizer stated that it was therefore disappointed to learn of this re-tweet and to also find on further investigation that four other Pfizer UK colleagues, including another senior colleague in the UK organisation, had re-tweeted the same post. Pfizer’s investigation also identified a further four UK based colleagues who had liked the tweet. However, the action of liking a tweet did not appear to cause the liked tweet to be displayed in the individuals’ Twitter feed and Pfizer consequently does not believe that these likes resulted in further UK dissemination of the original tweet. This Twitter activity was contrary to Pfizer UK’s social media policy and should have been identified and removed by the colleagues as part of the corrective and preventative action plan described above. Pfizer regretted that this was not the case. Pfizer recognised that the social media activity of these colleagues and their failure to identify and remove the erroneous activity, did not meet the standards expected of our industry and Pfizer therefore accepted a breach of Clause 5.1. Upholding confidence in the industry (Clause 2): Pfizer stated that the personal use of social media by pharmaceutical industry employees in relation to company business had long been acknowledged as a unique and challenging area for pharmaceutical companies. The Pfizer UK organisation recognised the responsibilities it had 5 to ensure appropriate use of social media by its employees, and Pfizer believed that it had taken all of the appropriate steps that could reasonably be expected of a pharmaceutical company in this area. Further to the extensive measures described above implemented by Pfizer UK to support colleagues’ appropriate personal use of social media, Pfizer also wished to highlight the following further measures that Pfizer had implemented on receipt of this complaint:  the Pfizer colleagues have deleted the re-tweets;  a further UK company-wide instruction was issued for all colleagues to check their social media accounts to ensure their activity complied with the Pfizer social media policy and the requirements of the Code and  a review would be undertaken by experienced members of the Pfizer Code Approval Team to check samples of employees’ social media for consistency with Pfizer’s UK policy and the Code. Notwithstanding the extensive measures described in this letter, Pfizer’s investigations had shown that four other UK colleagues re-tweeted the US Global colleague's tweet, including a second senior colleague from within the UK organisation. Pfizer accepted that these colleagues acted in error and these errors regretfully were likely to have resulted in the promotion of an unlicensed vaccine to the UK public in a manner that was not consistent with the requirements of Clause 2. Pfizer therefore accepted a breach of Clause 2 of the Code. Pfizer stated that it believed that throughout the pandemic the extensive measures that it had put in place around the personal use of social media represented a comprehensive and responsible approach to social media. Pfizer wished to emphasise that contrary to the complainant’s allegations, Pfizer had no such ‘determined, coordinated and concerted effort to use social media to actively promote our COVID-19 vaccine misleadingly and in advance of its approval’. PANEL RULING The Panel noted the complaint was about a tweet and re-tweet on the social media platform Twitter, now known as X, regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The complainant alleged, among other things, that claims were made which were not sufficiently complete and which failed to provide safety information. The Panel noted the original tweet was posted by a Pfizer US Global employee in November 2020, that same day this was re-tweeted by a senior UK employee which brought the tweet into the nexus of the ABPI Code, as acknowledged by Pfizer. The Panel noted that the case preparation manager had requested Pfizer consider the requirements of Clauses 2, 5.1, 6.1, 6.4 and 11.1 of the 2021 Code. The Panel noted the tweet and re-tweet, which were the subject to the complaint, had been made in November 2020, therefore the matters would be considered in relation to the requirements of the 2019 Code which was in place at that time. In this regard Clauses 2, 9.1, 7.2, 7.9 and 3.1 of the 2019 Code applied. Further the Panel noted the social media platform now X was known as Twitter at the time of the complaint and would therefore use the terminology Twitter, tweet and re-tweet for the purpose of this complaint. 6 Pfizer submitted that the original purpose of the tweet was to recognise an important step in Pfizer and BioNTech’s efforts to bring forward a potential COVID-19 vaccine. It was not intended to be promotional in nature. It contained a statement of fact of the efficacy endpoints of the study. It made clear that the data would then be submitted to the health authorities and did not make any suggestion or inference about future availability for the general public or potential impact of the vaccine on the course of the pandemic. It expressed gratitude to the clinical trial volunteers and all others who were fighting the pandemic. In the Panel’s view, in principle, it was not necessarily unacceptable for a company to refer, in very general terms, to its pipeline or work it was doing in response to a pandemic. However, language, context, location, layout, intended audience and overall impression were important factors. The Panel queried whether a social media platform, such as Twitter was the appropriate forum to share such information. The Panel noted that understandably there would be much interest in the work being done by pharmaceutical companies and others to investigate possible vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. However, companies must ensure that materials and activities complied with the Code. The Panel noted the original tweet stated ‘Our vaccine candidate is 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, and 94% effective in people over 65 years old. We will file all of our data with health authorities within days. Thank you to every volunteer in our trial, and to all who are tirelessly fighting this pandemic’. The Panel noted the tweet contained limited information regarding the efficacy of the vaccine candidate with no safety information provided. The Panel noted Pfizer’s submission that on further investigation into this complaint four other Pfizer UK colleagues, including another senior colleague in the UK organisation, had re-tweeted the same post. Pfizer’s investigation also identified a further four UK based colleagues who had liked the tweet. However, the action of liking a tweet did not appear to cause the liked tweet to be displayed in the individuals’ Twitter feed and Pfizer consequently did not believe that these likes resulted in further UK dissemination of the original tweet. The Panel noted Pfizer’s submission that the senior UK employee’s Twitter account, which was opened in June 2019 had, at the time of their response, 321 followers the majority of whom were professional individuals involved in, or with an interest in, the UK healthcare and research sector, they were not however, limited to only UK health professionals and other relevant decision makers. The Panel noted Pfizer provided no information on the followers of the other four UK employees who had also re-tweeted the US Global colleague’s tweet. On the balance of probabilities, it was likely that the Pfizer UK employee’s connections would include UK members of the public as well as UK health professionals. The Panel noted that when a tweet was re-tweeted it looked like an original authored tweet, with the original author’s name and username and in smaller text above the post, the name of the individual who re-tweeted the post, this would be pushed as a notification to all the re-tweeter’s connections in their twitter feed. The Panel noted that the tweet clearly referred to the outcome of the Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine being developed to protect against COVID-19. The Panel noted that Clause 3.1 prohibited the promotion of a medicine prior to the grant of its marketing authorisation. The vaccine was not classified as a prescription only medicine or been granted temporary emergency use authorisation to supply in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulation when 7 the tweet was made by the US Global Pfizer employee and re-tweeted by the senior UK employee and the other four UK employees one of which was a senior employee. The Panel noted the content of the re-tweet and that it was visually similar to an original authored tweet, on the balance of probabilities, its proactive dissemination to all five of the UK Pfizer employees’ connections, as a result of their re-tweet, constituted promotion of an unlicensed medicine and a breach of Clause 3.1 of the 2019 Code was ruled as acknowledged by Pfizer. The Panel noted Clause 7.2 of the 2019 Code stated, Information, claims and comparisons must be accurate, balanced, fair, objective and unambiguous and must be based on an up-to- date evaluation of all the evidence and reflect that evidence clearly. They must not mislead either directly or by implication, by distortion, exaggeration or undue emphasis. Material must be sufficiently complete to enable the recipient to form their own opinion of the therapeutic value of the medicine. The Panel noted the content of the tweet which had provided limited information regarding the efficacy of the vaccine candidate with no safety information regarding the Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidate. The Panel considered the re-tweet was not balanced and ruled a breach of Clause 7.2 of the 2019 Code as acknowledged by Pfizer. The Panel noted Clause 7.9 stated, among other things, that ‘Information and claims about adverse reactions must reflect available evidence or be capable of substantiation by clinical experience. It must not be stated that a product has no adverse reactions, toxic hazards or risks of addiction or dependency. The Panel noted the tweet made no reference to adverse events and was therefore concerned that important safety information relating to the vaccine candidate was not provided and ruled a breach of Clause 7.9 of the 2019 Code as acknowledged by Pfizer. The Panel noted Pfizer’s submission that Pfizer UK had a comprehensive policy on personal use of social media in relation to Pfizer’s business (copy provided) which prohibited colleagues from interacting with any social media related to Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines. Pfizer had also submitted that following three previous complaints and associated rulings of the Code, as part of Pfizer’s corrective and preventative action plan, the social media policy and training had been further enhanced to provide additional clarification. The policies were supported with interactive training and knowledge checks. The Panel further noted Pfizer’s submission that the Twitter activity, subject of this complaint, was contrary to Pfizer UK’s social media policy and should have been identified and removed by the colleagues as part of the corrective and preventative action plan, which had taken place following three previous complaints and associated rulings of breaches of the Code. The social media policy submitted to the Panel had an effective date of 1 October 2021 and since the re- tweet in November 2020 there had been two updates to the policy. The policy in place at the time of the re-tweet was not before the Panel. The Panel noted Pfizer stated that the senior employee whose re-tweet was the subject of this complaint had completed the social media training module in October 2019. Further, Pfizer submitted that throughout the pandemic Pfizer also ensured that briefings to colleagues informing them of newsworthy company updates related to the vaccine also included a reminder of the key elements of the Pfizer UK social media policy. The Panel noted the example briefing submitted by Pfizer in this regard was issued by a senior Pfizer UK employee seven days before the re-tweet was made and among other things stated, don't share content from other Pfizer accounts such as Pfizer Inc, as it has not been approved for a UK audience. The policy submitted, effective date 1 October 2021, provided information on interacting with social media 8 and stated among other things, that for ‘Pfizer Social Media Channels located outside the UK: Pfizer Inc Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn – do not interact', and each of the other example communications regarding Pfizer requirements on social media activities provided similar information for employees, contractors etc. The Panel noted the work undertaken by Pfizer UK organisation and their recognition of the responsibilities it had to ensure appropriate use of social media by its employees, including the additional measures implemented on receipt of this complaint. The Panel noted the sensitivities including heightened public interest at the time of the re-tweet around COVID-19, vaccines to protect against it as well as medicines for its treatment and considered it was particularly important that all staff and particularly senior employees complied with relevant rules and regulations. The Panel considered that the corrective and preventative actions taken following previous breaches of the code with respect to employee activity on social media had not been implemented to the standard which was expected or required. Activity which was clearly outside of company policy had not been taken down or deleted. It was unfortunate that Pfizer had been badly let down not only by the senior UK employee whose re-tweet was the subject of the complaint but by the four other Pfizer UK colleagues, including another senior colleague, who had also re-tweeted the same tweet made by a Pfizer US Global colleague; an action that resulted in the tweet for an unlicensed medicine being proactively disseminated on Twitter to health professionals and members of the public in the UK. In that regard high standards had not been maintained. A breach of Clause 9.1 of the 2019 Code was ruled, as acknowledged by Pfizer. The Panel considered that the five employees, which included two senior employees, had failed to recognise the impact re-tweeting the US Global employee’s post would have, given the tweet was regarding an unlicensed medicine, at a time when there was heightened public interest in potential vaccines for COVID-19, and would be viewed by health professionals and the public. Further, the two senior employees, due to their seniority, bore the responsibility of leading by example; their Twitter accounts were likely to be followed by many other Pfizer UK employees. Senior employees' adherence to internal policies and procedures was an essential element of company compliance; non-adherence was a serious breach of governance. The Panel noted that a ruling of a breach of Clause 2 was seen as a sign of particular censure and reserved for such and promotion prior to the grant of a marketing authorisation was an example of an activity likely to be in breach of Clause 2. Noting its comments and rulings above, the Panel considered that the Pfizer UK employees, including two senior employees, retweeting on their personal Twitter accounts about the company’s COVID-19 potential vaccine prior to the grant of its marketing authorisation, meant that Pfizer had brought discredit upon and reduced confidence in the pharmaceutical industry. The Panel ruled a breach of Clause 2 of the 2019 Code, as acknowledged by Pfizer. Complaint received 15 February 2023 Case completed 1 March 2024 process the text","completion":"The case AUTH/3741/2/23 involves a complaint against Pfizer regarding the promotional use of Twitter. It centers around a tweet posted by a Pfizer US employee, announcing the conclusion of the Phase 3 Study of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate with significant efficacy endpoints. This tweet was retweeted by a senior Pfizer UK employee, constituting engagement with content relating to an unlicensed medicine in the UK, thereby breaching the ABPI Code of Practice. The complainant raised concerns that the tweet misleadingly promoted Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine without providing absolute efficacy rates or safety data. Pfizer acknowledged breaches of several clauses of the 2019 Code, including promoting an unlicensed medicine, making misleading claims, and failing to maintain high standards. Pfizer's response highlighted their commitment to the Code and detailed the internal policies, training, and corrective actions taken in response to social media use relating to its vaccine. Despite these measures, the Panel ruled that Pfizer breached clauses related to misleading promotion, promoting an unlicensed medicine, and failure to maintain high standards, thus bringing discredit to the pharmaceutical industry. The case underscores the challenges pharmaceutical companies face in managing promotional activities on social media and the importance of adhering to regulatory guidelines to maintain public trust in the industry."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Provide the name in Traditional Chinese with Romanization and explanation, thank you.","completion":"If the stratocratic Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China, founded and led by Yuan Shikai in 1915, had transformed and survived as an empire beyond the National Protection War of 1915-1916, the empire might have chosen a name that reflected its historical context, aspirations, and Yuan Shikai's vision for his regime. Given the pattern of Chinese dynasties' names, such as the Ming (明朝) founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in 1368, and the Qing (清朝) founded by the Manchus in 1644, Yuan Shikai's empire would likely have picked a name that symbolized rejuvenation, strength, or a new beginning, aiming to legitimize his rule and establish a legacy distinct from the republicanism that preceded it and the dynastic rule that came before. A plausible name for Yuan Shikai's empire, considering his ambitions and the context of his rule, might have been the \\"Hongji\\" Empire with \\"Hong\\" (宏) symbolizing grandeur or vastness, and \\"Ji\\" (基) denoting foundation or base. The name \\"Hongji\\" (宏基) could therefore be interpreted as laying a grand or vast foundation, signifying Yuan's intent to establish a strong and enduring state. The name would reflect a break from the past and an ambition to create a powerful, stable empire under his leadership. Thus, the empire might have been called the Hongji Empire (宏基帝國, Hongji Diguo). This name is speculative and crafted in line with the conventions of naming dynasties in Chinese history, aiming to connote strength, prosperity, and a new era under Yuan Shikai's rule. Historically, the choice of a dynasty's name held deep cultural and political significance, often chosen to mark a distinct break from the past and to signify the dawn of a new era. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical exercise, as Yuan Shikai's empire was short-lived and dissolved following his death and the pressure from both domestic and international opposition."},{"prompt":"Привет дорогой друг)","completion":"Привет!

A lower price can attract new customers who were previously discouraged by the cost. 2. **Market Penetration:** A company may reduce prices to enter a new market or gain a larger share in an existing market. The aim is to attract customers from competitors by offering more value for a lower price. 3. **Clear Inventory:** If a company has excess inventory, it may lower prices to clear out stock. This is common for products that are perishable, seasonal, or about to be replaced by newer models. 4. **Response to Competition:** If competitors lower their prices or introduce cheaper alternatives, a company might reduce its prices to remain competitive and retain its market share. 5. **Economic Conditions:** During economic downturns, consumers become more price-sensitive. Lowering prices can help maintain sales volume when consumers are looking to cut spending. 6. **Increase Market Visibility:** Introducing a product at a lower price can generate buzz and attract attention, increasing brand visibility and potentially leading to higher sales volumes. 7. **Promotional Strategy:** Price drops can be part of promotional campaigns to increase short-term sales or introduce potential customers to a product or a brand. 8. **Cost Reductions:** If a company manages to reduce its production or operational costs, it may pass these savings onto consumers in the form of lower prices, thus potentially increasing volume sales without affecting profit margins. 9. **Product Life Cycle Management:** As a product matures and moves towards the end of its life cycle, companies might reduce its price to extract value from the remaining market before discontinuing the product. 10. **Encourage Bulk Purchases:** Lowering the price per unit when bought in larger quantities can encourage customers to buy more, increasing overall sales even if the profit margin per unit is reduced. Understanding and strategically managing product pricing is crucial for sustaining profitability and market presence. Each price adjustment decision is context-specific and must consider market conditions, company objectives, and consumer behavior."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between derivation, inflection... And word formation","completion":"The concepts of derivation, inflection, and word formation concern the ways in which words are created and modified in linguistics. They relate to morphological processes, which are the means by which words adapt to express different grammatical categories or create new words. 1. **Derivation**: This is a way of forming new words by adding prefixes, suffixes, or other elements to a base word or root, leading to a change in meaning or part of speech. Derivation is a type of word formation. For example, adding the suffix \\"-ness\\" to the adjective \\"happy\\" forms the noun \\"happiness\\"; or prefixing \\"un-\\" to \\"known\\" forms the adjective \\"unknown\\". The key aspect of derivation is that it often changes the grammatical category (or part of speech) of the word. The original word and the derived word may belong to different categories, for example, from a noun to an adjective, or from a verb to a noun. 2. **Inflection**: This is the modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. Unlike derivation, inflection does not change the basic category of a word; it only modifies the word to suit the grammatical requirements of its use in a sentence. For instance, the verb \\"talk\\" can be inflected to form \\"talks,\\" \\"talked,\\" or \\"talking,\\" based on tense and aspect. Similarly, the noun \\"cat\\" can become \\"cats\\" to indicate the plural. Inflection is a crucial part of syntax as it can influence the form of words to ensure grammatical agreement between different parts of a sentence. 3. **Word Formation**: Word formation refers to the processes by which new words are created in a language. It encompasses both derivation and compounding, as well as other processes such as blending, back-formation, clipping, and acronym creation. The essence of word formation is to expand the vocabulary of a language by generating new words or by giving existing words new meanings. - **Compounding**: Another significant word formation process, where two or more words are combined to create a new word with a distinct meaning, such as \\"toothpaste\\" (tooth + paste) or \\"sunflower\\" (sun + flower). - **Blending**: Involves taking parts of two (or more) words and merging them into a new word, often by taking the beginning of one word and the end of another; for example, \\"smog\\" (from \\"smoke\\" + \\"fog\\"). - **Back-formation**: This occurs when a simpler form of a word is created from a more complex form, such as the verb \\"edit\\" from the noun \\"editor\\". - **Clipping**: This is when a word is shortened without changing its meaning; for example, \\"demo\\" from \\"demonstration\\". - **Acronym Formation**: Creating a new word from the initial letters of a set of other words, where the new word itself can be pronounced as a word, like \\"NATO\\" (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). Each of these processes plays a vital role in the dynamism and development of a language, accommodating new concepts, technologies, and cultural phenomena."},{"prompt":"Is there any other morphological process","completion":"Yes, besides derivation, inflection, and the various methods of word formation like compounding, blending, clipping, back-formation, and acronyms, there are other morphological processes in linguistics that contribute to the creation and modification of words. Here are a few more: 1. **Reduplication**: This involves repeating a whole or part of a word to convey grammatical function or semantic nuance. Reduplication can indicate aspects such as plurality, intensity, duration, or repeated action, depending on the language. For example, in Indonesian, \\"orang\\" means \\"person,\\" while \\"orang-orang\\" can mean \\"people\\" or more than one person. 2. **Suppletion**: This is a morphological process where an irregular form of a word replaces the regular form, often in the word's inflection. Suppletion is best illustrated by irregular verbs or nouns in English, where the inflected forms bear little resemblance to the base form, such as \\"go\\" (base form) and \\"went\\" (past tense), as well as \\"good\\" (positive adjective) and \\"better\\" (comparative adjective). 3. **Conversion**: Also known as zero derivation, this process involves a change in the part of speech or function of a word without altering its form. For example, the noun \\"run\\" becomes the verb \\"to run,\\" and the noun \\"bottle\\" leads to the verb \\"to bottle\\". Conversion is fairly common in English and can occur between various grammatical categories. 4. **Abbreviation**: This occurs when a word or phrase is shortened but differently from clipping. Abbreviations may include the first letters of the words in a phrase and are often followed by periods, like \\"etc.\\" for \\"et cetera\\" or \\"e.g.\\" for \\"exempli gratia\\". Unlike acronyms, abbreviations are not pronounced as words but as the series of letters. 5. **Coinage/Neologism**: This refers to the creation of completely new words or phrases that are not derived from pre-existing words, often for new inventions, concepts, or products. Brand names often become generalized terms for similar items, such as \\"Kleenex\\" for tissues or \\"Google\\" being used as a verb for searching the internet. 6. **Borrowing**: The process of adopting words from other languages. English, for example, has borrowed extensively from languages around the world, like \\"ballet\\" from French, \\"piano\\" from Italian, and \\"yoga\\" from Sanskrit. Borrowing can include calques or loan translations, where the borrowed term is literally translated into native elements, like the French \\"gratte-ciel\\" from the English \\"skyscraper\\". These morphological processes, along with those previously mentioned, illustrate the diversity and complexity of language change and development. They reflect how languages expand their lexicons and adapt to new social, technological, and cultural influences."},{"prompt":"Is those methods have the same function to derivation and inflection so it means they're all the same","completion":"While derivation, inflection, and other morphological processes such as reduplication, suppletion, conversion, abbreviation, coinage/neologism, and borrowing all contribute to the way words are formed or modified in a language, they are not all the same. Each of these processes serves different linguistic functions, impacts the language differently, and operates under different rules. Let's briefly recap their primary functions and highlight their differences: 1. **Derivation** changes the meaning and often the grammatical class of words by adding affixes. It's central to creating new words with new meanings. 2. **Inflection** modifies words to fit grammatical contexts without changing the word's core meaning or its grammatical category. It's about conjugating verbs, declining nouns, and so on, to express tense, case, number, etc. 3. **Reduplication** uses repetition of whole or parts of words to change the word's meaning, often used for grammatical variations like tense, mood, aspect, or to intensify the meaning. 4. **Suppletion** involves using an entirely different word to express a grammatical variation of the same concept, bypassing regular morphological rules, as seen with \\"go\\" and \\"went\\". 5. **Conversion** (or zero derivation) shifts a word from one grammatical category to another without changing its form, thereby increasing lexical diversity using existing words. 6. **Abbreviation** and **Acronym Formation** shorten phrases or groups of words for ease of communication, creating new forms that can become independent words in their own right. 7. **Coinage/Neologism** directly introduces new words into a language, often for new concepts, technologies, or brands, expanding the lexicon. 8. **Borrowing** adopts words from other languages, enriching the vocabulary available and facilitating cultural exchange. While derivation and inflection are primarily concerned with changing existing words to create new forms or grammatical variations, the other processes can introduce entirely new words, represent words in shortened forms, or adapt words to different grammatical categories without affixation. They all contribute to the dynamism and adaptability of language, but they operate through distinct mechanisms and serve different communicative and linguistic functions. Understanding these differences is crucial for grasping how language structure works and how it evolves over time."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Amidst this backdrop, Yuan Shikai, a figure of monolithic ambition, aimed to implant the seeds of monarchical semblance in a republic-disillusioned China. His grand design, focalized around the establishment of the Empire of China in 1915, was intended as a resurrection of imperial majesty under modern guises. This chapter seeks to unravel the complex narrative of the Yuan Dynasty, an era that saw China oscillating between the pushes of innovation and the pulls of tradition. # The Genesis of the Empire The inception of the Empire was steeped in controversy and resistance. Yuan Shikai, leveraging his military prowess and political acumen, declared himself Emperor in a contentious move that divided the nation. Intent on reconsolidating a fragmented China under the banner of a new monarchy, Yuan found himself in the midst of widespread dissent. The National Protection War, initiated by Sun Yat-sen and the fervently republican factions, emerged as a formidable challenge to Yuan’s ambitions. # The Turning Tides of Fate The sudden demise of Sun Yat-sen, attributed to illness amidst the fervor of the National Protection War, marked a pivotal juncture in China's political odyssey. Sun's absence left a vacuum within the republican camp, severing the momentum of opposition against Yuan's imperial project. Compounded by Yuan's own passing amid conflict, a paradoxical scenario unfolded; the Empire of China, initially deemed a transient autocratic whim, found unexpected resilience under a regency council. # The Eternal Regency In an unforeseen continuation of the imperial narrative, Yuan Keding, the designated heir to the nascent throne, renounced his claim, rooted in a deep-seated aversion to the crown, potentially exacerbated by his half-Korean heritage in a time of fervent nationalism. This abdication propelled the Empire into a period of regency, governed by a council that amalgamated military stalwarts and bureaucratic elites. This council, ostensibly temporary, morphed into a permanent fixture, steering the Empire with a blend of authoritarianism and constitutional semblances. # The Cantonese Divergence Parallel to the consolidation of the Empire, the southern province of Guangdong emerged as a bastion of republicanism. The demise of Sun Yat-sen saw Chen Jiongming and other local leaders declare a de facto independent state, colloquially termed the \\"Cantonese Republic.\\" This entity, while not formally severing ties with the central authority, operated with pronounced autonomy, embodying the republican ideals that Sun championed. This division entrenched a split within China that persisted, playing a pivotal role in the nation’s socio-political dynamics. # Governance and Reform The regency era was marked by an ambitious, albeit cautious, push towards modernization. Efforts to stabilize the economy, coupled with attempts at infrastructural development and military modernization, were evident. A nuanced approach to foreign relations saw China navigating the waters of international diplomacy with a newfound pragmatism, balancing between traditional isolation and selective engagement. # Cultural Renaissance Amidst political and military turmoils, a cultural renaissance flourished under the regency. The era witnessed a resurgence of Confucian philosophies intertwined with a burgeoning interest in Western sciences and arts. This period fostered a unique synthesis of Chinese tradition and modern thought, shaping a distinct national identity that transcended political divisions. # Conclusion The era of the Yuan Dynasty, characterized by its foundational contradictions and unexpected resilience, stands as a testament to the complexities of Chinese statehood. The regency, initially a symbol of dynastic discontinuity, evolved into a defining epoch that saw the embryonic blending of monarchical authority with embryonic democratic aspirations. As China edged towards the mid-20th century, the legacies of the Yuan period remained deeply ingrained, shaping the trajectories of not only the Empire but also the Cantonese Republic, setting the stage for a new chapter in the annals of Chinese history."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While Moringa leaf tea is praised for its nutritional benefits, containing vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, it should not replace water as your primary source of hydration. Here's why: 1. **Hydration:** Pure water is the most effective hydrant. Beverages, especially those with diuretic properties, like tea, coffee, and even those containing antioxidants, can potentially lead to increased urination, which might not hydrate you as efficiently as water. 2. **Balance:** Drinking a variety of fluids can be part of a healthy lifestyle, but balance is key. Your body relies on water for almost every function, including regulating body temperature, maintaining moisture in tissues, and flushing out waste. 3. **Nutrition:** While moringa tea can provide beneficial nutrients, consuming it in excessive amounts to replace water might lead to nutrient imbalances or excessive intake of certain compounds. Moringa, for example, has a high level of vitamin A, and excessive consumption of this nutrient can lead to toxicity. 4. **Caloric Intake:** Pure water contains no calories, while some teas, especially if additives like sugar are used, may contribute to an increased caloric intake. Moringa tea itself is low in calories but replacing all your water intake with any flavored or sweetened beverage could add unnecessary calories to your diet. 5. **Caffeine and Other Compounds:** While moringa tea is low in caffeine compared to traditional teas and coffee, it still contains various bioactive compounds. Consuming it in moderation is key to avoid any potential adverse effects from excessive intake of these compounds. In summary, while incorporating moringa tea into your diet can contribute to your overall nutrient intake and offer health benefits, it's crucial to maintain a balanced diet and keep pure water as the primary source of hydration to ensure optimal health. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet, especially if you have underlying health conditions."},{"prompt":"Could not locate function 'mse'. Make sure custom classes are decorated with \`@keras.saving.register_keras_serializable()\`. Full object config: {'module': 'keras.metrics', 'class_name': 'function', 'config': 'mse', 'registered_name': 'mse'}","completion":"The error you're encountering suggests that there's an attempt to serialize or deserialize a Keras custom object—specifically a metric, in this case, 'mse'—but the process is failing because the expected format or handling for this object is incorrect. The message hints at a common solution for custom objects, which is to ensure they are decorated with \`@keras.saving.register_keras_serializable()\`, which is necessary for recognizing and correctly handling custom classes. However, for your specific case, the issue seems to stem from a misunderstanding or misconfiguration related to using a built-in metric rather than a custom one. # Understanding the Error 1. **Built-in Metrics**: \`mse\` stands for Mean Squared Error, a common regression metric, and is already available in Keras. Normally, you wouldn't need to manually decorate or register it since it's a built-in functionality. 2. **How to Specify Metrics Properly**: When configuring your model, you can pass built-in metrics like \`mse\` directly to the \`compile\` method without needing to worry about serialization or registration: \`\`\`python model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mse']) \`\`\` 3. **Serialization Issue**: If you are seeing this error, it might be due to how the metric is specified somewhere in your code or during the saving/loading of a model. It’s being incorrectly treated as a custom function or class when it should be recognized as a built-in metric. # Possible Solutions - **Correct Metric Specification**: Ensure you're using the string identifier 'mse' correctly in your model's compile method, and you're not accidentally treating it as a custom function. - **Model Saving and Loading**: If this issue arises during model saving or loading, make sure you're using the standard Keras model serialization methods (\`model.save()\` and \`keras.models.load_model()\`). For built-in metrics, there should be no need to manually handle serialization. - **Custom Metrics**: If you're actually trying to use a custom metric and named it 'mse' by coincidence, make sure you define it properly and, if necessary for your use case, register it with \`@keras.saving.register_keras_serializable()\`. \`\`\`python from tensorflow.keras.metrics import MeanSquaredError import tensorflow.keras.backend as K @keras.saving.register_keras_serializable() def custom_mse(y_true, y_pred): return K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1) # And then when compiling the model: model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=[custom_mse]) \`\`\` Ensure there’s clarity between using built-in functionalities and when actually implementing custom logic. The provided error message generally points towards issues with custom class serialization, which shouldn't be the case with built-in metrics like 'mse'. Review your model setup and serialization/deserialization process to identify any mismatches in how the 'mse' metric is being used."},{"prompt":"from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model # Load the pre-trained model model_y1 = load_model('snn_1142_hlp5_5m_relu_trainloss05_mae12_valloss12_mae14.h5') Could not locate function 'mse'. Make sure custom classes are decorated with \`@keras.saving.register_keras_serializable()\`. Full object config: {'module': 'keras.metrics', 'class_name': 'function', 'config': 'mse', 'registered_name': 'mse'}","completion":"The error message you're encountering indicates that TensorFlow is having trouble locating the 'mse' (mean squared error) function during the model loading process. This issue can occur if the model was saved with a custom object or layer that TensorFlow does not recognize by default when loading the model. However, 'mse' is a standard metric in TensorFlow/Keras, so this error is unusual for standard metrics or losses. To troubleshoot and potentially fix this issue, you can try a couple of approaches: 1. **Explicitly Register Custom Objects**: If you are using any custom objects, layers, or functions not recognized by TensorFlow by default, you need to explicitly inform TensorFlow about them when loading the model. However, since 'mse' is not a custom metric, this approach is just for knowledge: \`\`\`python from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model from tensorflow.keras.metrics import MeanSquaredError # Explicitly tell Keras where to find custom objects custom_objects = {'mse': MeanSquaredError} model_y1 = load_model('snn_1142_hlp5_5m_relu_trainloss05_mae12_valloss12_mae14.h5', custom_objects=custom_objects) \`\`\` 2. **Reinstallation or Upgrading TensorFlow**: The issue might come from a corrupt TensorFlow installation or a compatibility issue between the version of TensorFlow used to save the model and the one being used to load it. Try reinstalling or upgrading TensorFlow to ensure you have a clean, compatible version: \`\`\`shell # First, uninstall TensorFlow pip uninstall tensorflow # Then, reinstall TensorFlow pip install tensorflow \`\`\` Or, if you want to upgrade to the latest version: \`\`\`shell pip install --upgrade tensorflow \`\`\` 3. **Ensure Consistent Environment**: If the model was trained and saved in a different Python environment (possibly with a different TensorFlow version), make sure to replicate that environment as closely as possible. This includes installing the same versions of TensorFlow and other dependencies that were used initially. If your model doesn't actually use any custom metrics, layers, or loss functions and you're still encountering this error, then re-installing or upgrading TensorFlow is likely your best bet. It's rather uncommon for TensorFlow to be unable to locate its standard functions like 'mse' without there being an installation issue or severe bug, which would likely have prominent discussion and resolution strategies available in the TensorFlow GitHub issues or Stack Overflow."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

**调整dropout比例**：减小dropout比例，避免过度正则化。 - **增加训练时长**：增加训练的轮数，让模型有更多时间来适应通过dropout引入的噪声。 - **调整其它超参数**：对学习率、批量大小等其它超参数进行微调，找到最优的参数组合。 - **增加数据量**：如果可能的话，增加更多的训练数据，或者尝试数据增强技术。 - **模型结构调整**：尝试不同的模型结构，找到最适合当前任务的架构。 总之，理解dropout如何影响模型的学习过程，并根据具体情况调整策略是非常重要的。有时候，合理地调整参数和模型结构比简单地加入dropout会带来更好的效果。"},{"prompt":"目前的dropout比例是0.1","completion":"如果你当前使用的dropout比例为0.1，这通常被认为是比较保守的设置，因为这意味着每次训练迭代时只有10%的神经元会被随机丢弃。通常情况下，这样的比例不太可能导致过度正则化。然而，如果模型的验证损失相比不使用dropout时仍然较高，可能还需要从以下几个角度来考虑和调整： 1. **其他超参数**：如果dropout比例相对较低且模型性能下降，这可能与其他超参数的设置有关。例如，学习率可能太高或太低，或者批量大小不适当，影响了模型的学习过程。此时，尝试调整这些参数可能会有所帮助。 2. **足够的训练时间**：使用dropout意味着在训练过程中网络的有效容量减少，因此可能需要更多的时间来训练模型，以确保其在剩余的“有效”神经元上学习到足够的代表性特征。请考虑增加训练的迭代次数或者轮次。 3. **网络架构调整**：有时候模型架构和任务不是很匹配，或者模型的容量不够大，无法通过现有的网络架构捕捉到数据中的复杂关系。这种情况下，可能需要重新考虑网络设计，比如增加更多的层或者尝试不同的架构。 4. **数据处理和增强**：检查数据预处理步骤，确保没有错误或不恰当的操作影响到了模型的训练。此外，尝试使用数据增强技术来丰富训练数据，提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。 5. **模型复杂度**：虽然当前的dropout比例较低，但如果模型本身非常简单，即便是小比例的dropout也可能导致性能下降。在这种情况下，可以考虑减少dropout层的使用，或在关键层使用dropout。 6. **性能指标**：最后，确认你用于衡量模型性能的指标确实适合你的任务。有时损失函数可能不完全反映出模型对实际任务的有效性。 如果以上讨论的调整措施仍然无法改善模型的验证损失，可能需要更深入地分析模型和数据，甚至考虑是否有必要使用dropout。对于一些特定任务或数据集，dropout可能并不总是最佳选择，可能需要探索其他正则化方法，如权重衰减（L2正则化）或者批量归一化等。"},{"prompt":"目前的train loss曲线趋于平缓，但是val loss还有下降趋势，那么应该如何处理？","completion":"当训练损失（train loss）曲线趋于平缓，但验证损失（val loss）仍显示下降趋势时，这意味着模型可能仍在从训练数据中学习，并且还有进一步提升模型在未见数据上表现的空间。这种情况通常被视为一个积极的信号，因为它表明模型尚未过拟合。以下是一些可能的处理措施来进一步改善模型性能： # 1. 增加训练时间 既然验证损失仍然有下降趋势，这表明模型可能还没有达到其学习的潜能。增加训练的迭代次数或训练轮次（epochs），让模型有更多的时间来调整其权重以更好地适应训练数据。 # 2. 调整学习率 如果训练损失已经很难进一步降低，可以考虑调整学习率。如果学习率太大，模型的权重更新可能太过激烈，难以细致地适应数据特征；如果学习率太小，模型的学习过程可能过于缓慢。你可以尝试使用学习率调度，比如学习率衰减，逐渐减小学习率以帮助模型更细致地调整其权重。 # 3. 使用更复杂的模型 如果模型的训练损失已经很低，但验证损失仍在下降，这可能意味着当前的模型过于简单，不能完全捕捉数据中的复杂性。尝试使用更复杂的网络架构可能会有帮助，比如增加更多的层或增加每层的神经元数量。 # 4. 更细致的数据增强 数据增强可以有效提高模型的泛化能力，如果你还没有使用数据增强，现在可能是一个好时机。如果已经使用了基本的数据增强，考虑加入更多种类的增强技术或调整现有技术的参数。 # 5. 使用正则化技术 考虑使用或调整正则化技术，如L1/L2正则化、dropout等，以避免过拟合并提高模型的泛化性能。如果你已经使用了dropout，尝试调整丢弃率来查看是否有助于进一步改善模型表现。 # 6. 关注数据质量 确保训练数据和验证数据的质量。有时，数据清洗和预处理的不同策略会对模型性能产生显著影响。此外，确保验证集是代表性的，以能真实反映模型在未见数据上的性能。 # 7. 早停法（Early Stopping） 如果你还没有使用早停法，那么当验证损失不再改善时自动停止训练是一个很好的策略，以避免过拟合并节约计算资源。 综上所述，当训练损失趋于平缓但验证损失还有下降趋势时，说明你的模型正处于一个相对良好的状态，你可以通过以上策略进一步改善模型的表现。每种方法都有其适用场景，可能需要根据具体情况进行尝试和调整。"},{"prompt":"那么基于现在训练的checkpoint，我们修改学习率继续训练可以吗？","completion":"是的，基于当前训练的checkpoint修改学习率继续训练是一个完全可行且常见的做法。这种方法可以帮助模型进一步提升性能，尤其是在训练过程中遇到学习速率过高或过低导致学习停滞的情况。通过调整学习率，你可以更细致地控制模型的训练过程，有助于避免过拟合或者加速模型的收敛。 # 实施步骤 1. **保存Checkpoint**：在修改学习率之前，确保你已经保存了当前训练的模型checkpoint。这包括模型的权重和优化器状态。 2. **调整学习率**： - 如果你发现训练损失降低得太慢，可能需要**增加学习率**以加速学习过程。 - 如果训练损失表现出剧烈波动，或验证损失上升，表明学习率可能太高，此时应该**降低学习率**以帮助模型更平滑、细致地收敛。 3. **恢复训练**：加载之前保存的checkpoint，并用更新后的学习率初始化优化器。然后继续训练过程。 4. **监控表现**：在调整学习率后，继续监控模型的训练和验证损失，以确保模型正在正确学习。根据模型的表现，可能需要进一步微调学习率。 # 注意事项 - **渐变调整**：在训练过程中渐进地调整学习率通常更为安全，避免突然大幅度更改学习率导致模型性能的不稳定。 - **学习率调度器**：考虑使用学习率调度器，如学习率衰减、余弦退火等策略，这些策略可以根据训练进度自动调整学习率，有助于获得更好的训练效果。 - **记录和实验**：每次调整学习率时，记得记录下来，这样可以帮你理解不同设置对模型性能的影响，找到最适合你模型的学习率。 通过根据训练过程和模型表现调整学习率，你可以更加精准地指导模型学习，优化模型性能。记得这是一个试错的过程，需要耐心和细心。"},{"prompt":"当前我们的训练loss降低缓慢，趋于平缓，val loss降低-升高-下降，那么基于当前checkpoint，应该如何继续训练，可以修改哪些参数或操作","completion":"当训练损失降低缓慢且趋于平缓，而验证损失则呈现降低-升高-下降的趋势时，这表明模型可能遇到了一定的学习瓶颈，同时验证损失的波动可能表示了过拟合的早期迹象或者模型对于训练数据的泛化能力正在发生变化。在这种情况下，可以采取以下几种策略来调整训练过程： # 1. **调整学习率** - **降低学习率**：如果模型学习已经取得进展，但进一步降低训练损失变得困难，适当降低学习率可能有助于模型在参数空间中更细致地搜索，从而改善性能。这在特别是当验证损失开始上升时尤其有效。 - **使用学习率调度器**：考虑采用如学习率衰减（每几个epochs降低学习率）、余弦退火等策略，根据训练进度自动调整学习率。 # 2. **增加/减少正则化** - **增加正则化**：如果验证损失开始上升，表明模型可能开始过拟合。考虑增加模型的正则化，例如调高dropout率、增加L2权重衰减等，以增强模型的泛化能力。 - **减少正则化**：如果训练损失降低非常缓慢且验证损失始终较高，这可能表明模型欠拟合。在这种情况下，可以尝试减少正则化。 # 3. **数据增强** - **扩展数据集**：如果模型表现出过拟合迹象，增加数据增强的程度可以提供更多的训练样本变体，帮助提高模型的泛化能力。 # 4. **更改模型架构** - **调整模型容量**：可能需要重新考虑模型的大小或架构。如果模型过大，容易过拟合；如果模型过小，又可能不足以捕捉数据中的所有关系。根据当前的训练和验证损失情况调整模型大小是一种方法。 # 5. **早停法（Early Stopping）** - **早停**：如果验证损失经过初期的降低后开始上升，即使训练损失仍然缓慢下降，这时候可以考虑使用早停法来结束训练，避免过拟合。需要定期检查验证损失，并在其开始持续上升时停止训练。 # 6. **调整批量大小** - **调整批量大小**：增大或减小批量大小可能有助于提升模型的性能和稳定性。较大的批量可以提供更稳定的梯度估计，但可能会增加过拟合的风险；较小的批量提供更多的随机性，有助于正则化，但梯度估计可能更加不稳定。 调整任何以上参数或者操作时，建议逐一试验并监控模型在训练集和验证集上的表现，以找到最优的训练策略。同时，记录每次变更的结果，有助于理解不同设置对模型性能的影响以及潜在的改进空间。"},{"prompt":"val loss短暂上升一点有开始下降了，那么也算过拟合吗？","completion":"验证损失（val loss）在训练过程中短暂上升后又开始下降，并不一定意味着过拟合。在深度学习模型的训练过程中，由于多种因素，短期内的性能波动是非常常见的。这种波动可能是学习率设置、批次（batch）中样本的随机性、模型架构的特性或是优化器的特定行为所导致的。 # 过拟合的标志 过拟合通常是通过以下特征来判断的： - 训练损失持续下降，而验证损失停止下降，并在一段时间后开始持续上升。 - 模型在训练数据上的表现远超过在验证数据上的表现。 # 分析验证损失的短暂上升 对于你描述的情况，验证损失短暂上升后再次下降可能表示： 1. **优化过程的波动性**：随着优化器（如SGD、Adam等）在参数空间中的探索，模型可能会遇到使得损失短期上升的优化“坑”，但很快又找到了更好的方向继续下降。 2. **学习率调整**：如果使用了学习率衰减或者其他形式的动态学习率调整策略，那么在学习率变化节点附近，可能会观察到性能的短暂波动。 3. **批次间的差异**：特别是在小批次的情况下，批次间的样本差异可能会引起损失的波动，特别是验证集的样本如果不是很均匀，则可能在某些批次中表现出短暂的性能下降。 # 应对措施 - **观察长期趋势**：关注验证损失的长期趋势而不是短期波动。只有当验证损失持续上升时，才能更肯定地说模型开始过拟合。 - **早停法（Early Stopping）**：使用早停法可以在验证损失不再改善时自动停止训练，从而防止过拟合。 - **学习率调整**：如果波动过大，可以考虑调整学习率或使用学习率调度器来减少学习率，帮助模型更平稳地收敛。 - **数据增强和正则化**：增强数据集或使用正则化技术（Dropout、L2正则化等）来提高模型的泛化能力，减少对特定训练批次的敏感性。 综上所述，短暂的验证损失上升不一定意味着过拟合。重要的是关注长期的趋势，并在必要时采取合适的策略来优化模型的训练过程。"},{"prompt":"那么现在我们基于当前训练得到的checkpoint继续训练再看看结果吗？还是说降低学习率","completion":"基于当前训练得到的checkpoint继续训练，并观察结果对于决定下一步如何调整模型和训练过程是一个有效的方法。同时，根据你的描述，如果验证损失经历了短暂的上升后又开始下降，这可能表明模型仍在有效学习，但也可能提示当前的学习率设置在某些训练阶段不是最优的。下面是一个建议的步骤，结合连续训练和调整学习率： # 1. 继续训练并观察 - **继续训练**：从当前的checkpoint开始继续训练，密切关注验证损失和训练损失的变化。 - **评估趋势**：如果验证损失继续下降，这意味着模型仍在从训练数据中学习并且提高了泛化性能。这种情况下，可能没有必要立刻调整学习率。 # 2. 考虑学习率调整 - **学习率调度器**：如果你还没有使用学习率调度器，引入一个可以根据训练进度自动调整学习率的策略，如学习率衰减或余弦退火，可能会有助于优化训练效果。 - **手动调整**：如果已经观察到明显的波动或停滞，并且你有理由相信当前的学习率不是最佳的，可以考虑手动减少学习率。减小学习率可以帮助模型在参数空间中更平稳地搜寻，特别是当你发现验证损失开始出现上升趋势时。 # 3. 提高泛化能力 - **正则化和数据增强**：如果出现过拟合迹象，加强模型的正则化（例如，增加dropout比例、使用权重衰减）或增加数据增强的复杂度和种类。 # 结合上述建议，采取的具体行动应基于对模型当前状态的判断： -

**学习率调整**：\`CosineAnnealingLR\`会在每个周期内按照余弦曲线降低学习率，学习率会从初始值降至一个最小值，然后可能重新“重启”，模拟了“冷却”和“重新加热”的过程，有助于跳出局部最小值，寻找更好的解。 - **周期性重启**：在长训练过程中，使用\`CosineAnnealingLR\`可以通过周期性地重置学习率到较高值，使得模型有机会跳出局部最优，并在随后的“冷却”期间细化搜索，寻找更优的参数配置。 # 优势 - **避免陷入局部最优**：由于学习率会在一定周期内逐渐降低后再重置，这有助于模型在训练早期进行较广泛的搜索，在训练后期细化搜索，减少陷入局部最优解的风险。 - **自适应调整**：\`CosineAnnealingLR\`通过余弦曲线自然地调整学习率，不需要太多的手动干预，只需设置好周期和最小学习率等参数。 - **提高泛化能力**：通过周期性地调整学习率，有助于模型探索参数空间中不同的区域，这可以提高模型的泛化能力。 # 劣势 - **参数选择挑战**：正确设置周期长度（\`T_max\`）和最小学习率（\`ETA_MIN\`）可能需要一些试验和错误，以找到最佳设置。 - **可能的性能波动**：特别是在较早的“重启”期，较高的学习率可能会暂时增加训练和验证损失，直到学习率再次降低。 - **对某些问题可能不是最优**：虽然\`CosineAnnealingLR\`适用于许多情况，但对某些特定的问题或数据集，简单或更传统的学习率调度策略（如步进衰减）可能会更有效。 # 与步进调整相比 相比较原始的步进调整学习率（每隔固定的epoch数就大幅度降低学习率），\`CosineAnnealingLR\`提供了一种更加平滑、动态的学习率调整方式。步进调整往往更为简单直观，容易实现，但可能不如\`CosineAnnealingLR\`那样有助于模型寻找到更好或更全面的解决方法，尤其是在较长的训练过程中。然而，对于某些任务和数据集，简单的步进衰减就已足够，且实现起来更为直接。选择哪种方法应根据具体任务、数据集特性以及训练周期的长短来决定。"},{"prompt":"基于我们原本的的yaml文件，上述提供的，我们采用新的CosineAnnealingLR更佳吗？","completion":"基于你提供的配置文件和描述，考虑到你的训练已经执行了60个epochs，并且在这个阶段训练损失趋于平缓而验证损失经历了先下降后上升再下降的过程，采用\`CosineAnnealingLR\`作为学习率调度策略是一个值得尝试的优化。 # 为什么\`CosineAnnealingLR\`可能更佳？ 1. **避免局部最小**: 你的模型可能正在接近或已经陷入一个局部最优解，\`CosineAnnealingLR\`通过周期性地调整学习率，提供了一种机制来帮助模型“跳出”局部最小值。 2. **细化搜索**: 指定的10个epochs附加训练，使用\`CosineAnnealingLR\`能在这个期间内通过减小学习率，帮助模型在参数空间中进行更细致的搜索，可能会找到性能更好的解。 3. **减轻过拟合风险**: 周期性地减少学习率可以在一定程度上减轻过拟合的风险，因为在后期训练时，较小的学习率不太可能导致模型参数在训练数据上过度调整。 # 实施建议 - **充分利用余弦退火周期**: 由于你计划额外进行10个epochs的训练，你可以将这10个epochs视作一个完整的退火周期，或者根据你对模型性能的观察来调整这一周期的长度，以及设置一个适当的最小学习率\`ETA_MIN\`。 - **结合早停(Early Stopping)**: 考虑到你的模型在训练和验证集上的表现，结合使用早停策略和\`CosineAnnealingLR\`可能会更有效。如果验证性能经历一段时间的不改善或开始恶化，则停止训练，以防过拟合。 - **观察并调整**: 监控使用\`CosineAnnealingLR\`之后的模型表现。如果观察到模型性能相比之前有所改善，则这表明这是一个合适的调度器。否则，可能需要进一步调试或尝试其他策略。 总的来说，尽管\`CosineAnnealingLR\`为训练提供了一个有希望的方向，特别是在面对可能的局部最优和需要细化搜索的情况下，但选择最合适的学习率调度策略往往需要根据模型的具体情况和多次实验的结果来决定。"},{"prompt":"我们的训练过程中，train loss在下降，val loss在50epoch之前持续降低，50-60之间先升后降，但是还未降低到比50epoch时的loss低，那么我们采用CosineAnnealingLR代替步进式训练应该在50epoch开始再训练，还是再60epoch时训练？","completion":"根据你的描述，验证损失（val loss）在第50个epoch之前持续下降，而在50到60个epoch之间经历了先升高后下降的波动，但是还没有低于第50个epoch时的水平。这种情况下，选择在哪个epoch开始应用\`CosineAnnealingLR\`取决于你对模型当前状态的评估以及你的目标。 # 如果就在50个epoch开始应用\`CosineAnnealingLR\` **优点**： -

Marx (1847) says: The question of property, depending on the different levels of development of industry, has always been the vital question for a particular class. In the 17th and 18th centuries, when the point at issue was the abolition offeudal property relations, the question of property was the vital question for the bourgeois class. In the 19th century, when it is a matter of abolishing bourgeois property relations, the question of property is a vital question for the working class. The state’s major task is to defend exploitative property rights. So the following statement from Resnick and Wolff, two post-modernist Marxists, does not make sense: To own property in a particular society need not empower the owner to employ another human being or to participate in state decisions; that would depend, for example, on ideological and political conditions in that society. To be propertyless need not require a person to sell labor power; that would depend, for example, on whether propertyless persons had socially recognized access to income from other sources [such as the state]. (Resnick and Wolff, 2006: 119) Therefore, the authors argue, ‘To wield state powers of all sorts need not require ownership of property; that would depend on the social rules whereby power is granted to individuals’ (ibid.). It is true that whether a given propertyless person must sell labour power would depend on whether he/she has socially recognized access to income from sources such as state, but if the state provided adequate means of subsistence to all propertyless, would there be class relations of any sort? And if the state does not and cannot do so, then the question is, why not? The class nature of the state is attested not by the fact that every act is exclusively in the direct interest of the ruling class only, but by the fact that all other interests are, more or less regularly, subordinated to the interests of the ruling class, that the acts of the state are decisively shaped by what the ruling class and its political representatives take its interests to be. Acts of the state take place only within the framework of the interests of the ruling class. It is important to recognize the similarities between the capitalist state and pre-capitalist-type states in order to understand the relatively autonomous role of the capitalist state and its actors. Without doing that how would one understand the independent role of the czarist state in Russia or the state in Japan where the samurai, the hereditary military nobility and officer caste, and warriors of medieval and early modern Japan ‘had to create capitalism and a capitalist class of which they could be part’ (Ollman, 2003: 200; italics added)? If they were independent of class relations as such, why did they not create a socialist state? The state is affected by numerous processes in a class society. It is affected by the changing balance of power of the basic classes, that is, by class struggle, which often coexists with other kinds of struggles such as ecological and anti-oppression struggles. The state is affected by the need to sustain class exploitation and wealth accumulation in the hands of property owners, by external threats to a society, by the autonomous interests of state officials/ politicians, by the need to intervene on behalf of society as a whole (clearing forests, making roads, providing for people during a pandemic or natural calamity, or checking excessive environmental damage), and by the contradiction between productive forces and relations leading to the crisis of production — all within the limits of the class logic of the state, that is, the need to suppress the direct producers and reproduce exploitative private property rights. Engels (1886) says that ‘the will of the state is, on the whole, deter-mined . . . in the last resort, by the development of the productive forces and relations of exchange’. The emphasis on the class character of the state means that the state actually has a dual function. It defends the structure of class relations and the effects of class relations. That is, it defends private property and exploitation, and it also defends the inequality in consumption and income, which is dominantly caused by private property and exploitation. This under-stressed aspect of the state (i.e. the relation between the state and inequality), along with the fact that, as Engels says, the state is affected by the level of the development of productive forces, has an implication for understanding the post-capitalist transitional state, revealing a potential limitation in Lenin’s thinking. Trotsky (1991: 45—6) wrote in Revolution betrayed: A socialist state even in America, on the basis of the most advanced capitalism, could not immediately provide everyone with as much as he needs, and would therefore be compelled to spur everyone to produce as much as possible. The duty of the stimulator in these circumstances naturally falls to the state, which in its turn cannot but resort, with various changes and mitigations, to the method of labor payment worked out by capitalism. It was in this sense that Marx wrote in 1875: ‘Bourgeois law . . . is inevitable in the first phase of the communist society, in that form in which it issues after long labor pains from capitalist society. Law can never be higher than the economic structure and the cultural development of society conditioned by that structure.’ Trotsky continues, now referring to Lenin: In explaining these remarkable lines [from Marx], Lenin adds: ‘Bourgeois law in relation to the distribution of the objects of consumption assumes, of course, inevitably a bourgeois state, for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of compelling observance of its norms. It follows (we are still quoting Lenin) that under Communism not only will bourgeois law survive for a certain time, but also even a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie!’ To the extent that the state has important economic functions in all societies, it will, more or less, have those functions in the transitional society too. Trotsky (1991: 46—7) explains in Revolution betrayed: Insofar as the state which assumes the task of socialist transformation is compelled to defend inequality—that is, the material privileges ofa minority— by methods of compulsion, insofar does it also remain a ‘bourgeois’ state, even though without a bourgeoisie. These words contain neither praise nor blame; they name things with their real name. . . It is because Lenin, in accord with his whole intellectual temper, gave an extremely sharpened expression to the conception of Marx, that he revealed the source of the future difficulties, his own among them, although he did not himself succeed in carrying his analysis through to the end. ‘A bourgeois state without a bourgeoisie’ proved inconsistent with [the principle of] genuine Soviet democracy. The relation between the state and inequality in consumption is an important matter. ‘The dual function of the state’, that is, the protection of specific property relations and regulation of inequalities, ‘could not but affect its structure’, as revealed by the experience of 1917, which ‘theory was unable clearly to foresee’. If for the defence of socialized property against bourgeois counterrevolution a ‘state of armed workers’ was fully adequate, it was a very different matter to regulate inequalities in the sphere of consumption. Those deprived of property are not inclined to create and defend it. The majority cannot concern itself with the privileges of the minority. For the defence of ‘bourgeois law’ the workers’ state was compelled to create a ‘bourgeois’ type of instrument — that is, the same old gendarme, although in a new uniform. (Trotsky, 1991: 47) Then, apart from the matter of consumption inequality, there is the matter concerning the low level of the development of productive forces as such. The state must promote the development of productive forces (either for ‘society as a whole’ or in the interest of the economically dominant class). What happens if the private property is overthrown, but the low level of the development of productive forces exists in part because of isolatedness of the revolutionary transition and attendant bureaucratism within the post-revolution society, constituting a form of ‘combined development’ where advanced social relations (that is, relations indicating transition to socialism) coexist with relatively backward level of economic development and common people not enjoying an adequate amount of means of subsistence? It is not just private property relations that explain the nature of the state. Relative economic backwardness can also contribute to the state’s continued reproduction. This is a theme that has been relatively neglected, including by Lenin. Basing himself wholly upon the Marxian theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Lenin did not succeed . . . in drawing all the necessary conclusions as to the character of the state from the economic backwardness and isolatedness of the country. Explaining the revival of bureaucratism by the unfamiliarity of the masses with administration and by the special difficulties resulting from the war, the program [i.e. Lenin’s socialist programme) prescribes merely political measures for the overcoming of ‘bureaucratic distortions’: elections and recall at any time of all plenipotentiaries, abolition of material privileges, active control by the masses, etc. It was assumed that along this road the bureaucrat, from being a boss, would turn into a simple and moreover temporary technical agent, and the state would gradually and imperceptibly disappear from the scene. (Trotsky, 1991: 49-0; italics added) There are some practical implications of the class theory of the state. One is that as long as class relations exists, the state, the main task of which is the political subjugation of the masses, will exist. So the overthrow of class relations, including property relations, and the overthrow of the existing state are a necessary condition for a classless and stateless society. There is another implication which is connected to the last one. If the state arose with class divisions and if therefore there was no state in the original (‘primitive’) classless society, that means that people can manage their affairs without the state in a future society which is classless and which is economically much more developed than any form of society in the present or in the past. For Engels, the possibility revealed by the gentile constitution was a major guarantee that the Marxist vision of the withering away of the State in a future communist society was not a recipe for chaos, as was argued by his opponents. (Bloch, 1983: 82) Yet historical experience has shown that in the post-1917 societies, the state remained a very powerful agent vis-à-vis ordinary people. As we have seen, this can be explained on the basis of the class theory of the state.17 ”翻译为中文","completion":"财产问题对于国家问题来说是绝对至关重要的。马克思（1847）说： “财产问题，根据工业发展的不同阶段，始终是特定阶级的生命线问题。在17和18世纪，当争论点是废除封建产权关系时，财产问题是资产阶级的生命线问题。在19世纪，当问题是废除资产阶级产权关系时，财产问题是工人阶级的生命线问题。 国家的主要任务是捍卫剥削性的产权。因此，后现代马克思主义者雷斯尼克和沃尔夫的以下声明就说不通了： 在一个特定社会拥有财产并不一定赋予所有者雇佣另一个人或参与国家决策的权力；这将取决于，例如，该社会的意识形态和政治条件。无产者并不一定需要出售劳动力；这将取决于，例如，无产者是否有其他来源（如国家）的社会认可的收入渠道。 （雷斯尼克和沃尔夫，2006：119） 因此，作者们认为，“有各种国家权力不一定需要拥有财产；这将取决于授予个人权力的社会规则”（同上）。确实，一个特定的无产者是否必须出售劳动力将取决于他/她是否拥有诸如国家之类的来源的社会认可的收入，但如果国家为所有无产者提供了足够的生活手段，还会有任何形式的阶级关系吗？如果国家没有而且无法做到这一点，那么问题是，为什么不呢？ 国家的阶级性质不是通过每一个行为都唯一直接符合统治阶级利益的事实来证明的，而是通过所有其他利益或多或少地定期地从属于统治阶级的利益，也就是说，国家的行为由统治阶级及其政治代表认为的其利益决定性地塑造。国家的行动只能在符合统治阶级利益的框架内进行。 为了理解资本主义国家和前资本主义型国家之间的相似性以及资本主义国家及其行动者相对自治的角色，这是非常重要的。如果不这样做，怎么能理解俄国沙皇制度或日本国家中的武士（中世纪和近代早期日本的世袭军事贵族和官员阶层以及战士）“必须创造资本主义并成为其一部分”的独立角色呢（奥尔曼，2003：200; 斜体添加）？如果它们独立于阶级关系本身，它们为什么不创造一个社会主义国家呢？ 国家受到阶级社会中众多过程的影响。它受到基本阶级力量平衡变化的影响，即阶级斗争，这通常与其他类型的斗争共存，如生态和反压迫斗争。国家受到维持阶级剥削和财富在产权所有者手中积累的需要影响，受到对社会的外部威胁影响，受到国家官员/政客的自主利益影响，受到代表整个社会干预的需要影响（清理森林、修建道路、在大流行或自然灾害期间为人们提供帮助，或检查过度环境破坏），并受到生产力与关系之间的矛盾导致的生产危机的影响——所有这些都在国家的阶级逻辑的限制内发生，即需要压制直接生产者并再生产剥削性的私有产权。恩格斯（1886）说，“国家的意志整体上是……最终由生产力和交换关系的发展所决定的”。 强调国家的阶级特性意味着国家实际上具有双重功能。它捍卫阶级关系和阶级关系的影响的结构。也就是说，它捍卫私有财产和剥削，它也捍卫由私有财产和剥削主要引起的消费和收入不平等。这种对国家的强调不足的方面（即国家与不平等之间的关系），连同恩格斯所说的国家受到生产力发展水平影响的事实，对于理解后资本主义过渡国家有一定的启示，揭示了列宁思想中的潜在局限性。托洛茨基（1991：45-46）在《被背叛的革命》中写道： 即使在最先进的资本主义基础上的美国，社会主义国家也不能立即为每个人提供他们所需要的一切，因此将被迫鼓励每个人尽可能地生产。在这种情况下，激励者的责任自然落在了国家身上，而后者又不能不采用资本主义制定的劳动报酬方法，只是进行了各种变化和减轻。正是在这个意义上，马克思在1875年写道： “资产阶级法则...在共产主义社会的第一阶段是不可避免的，即它在长期的劳动痛苦之后从资本主义社会中发展出来的形式。法律绝不能高于经济结构和由该结构决定的社会的文化发展水平。” 托洛茨基继续，现在提到列宁： 在解释这些引人注目的行文时，列宁补充说： “与消费品分配相关的资产阶级法则，当然不可避免地假定一个资产阶级国家，因为没有能够强制遵守其规范的机构，法律就是空话。因此（我们仍在引用列宁的话），在共产主义下不仅资产阶级法律将继续存在一段时间，甚至一个没有资产阶级的资产阶级国家也会存在！” 在所有社会中，国家都有重要经济职能的程度上，它在过渡社会中也将或多或少拥有那些职能。托洛茨基（1991: 46—7）在《被背叛的革命》中解释说： 在国家承担社会主义转型任务的过程中，被迫以强制手段保护不平等——即少数人的物质特权——的程度上，它仍然是一个“资产阶级”国家，即使没有资产阶级。这些话既不是赞扬也不是责备；它们用真实的名字命名事物... 正是因为列宁根据他的整个知识性格，对马克思的观点给予了极为尖锐的表达，他揭示了未来困难的根源，包括他自己的困难，尽管他自己没有成功地将分析进行到底。“没有资产阶级的资产阶级国家”与[原则上的]真正苏维埃民主不相容。 国家与消费不平等之间的关系是一个重要问题。“国家的双重功能”，即保护特定产权关系和调节不平等，“不可避免地影响了其结构”，正如1917年的经验所显示的，“理论无法清晰预见”。 如果为了保卫社会化财产免受资产阶级反革命的侵害，“武装工人的国家”完全足够的话，那么在消费领域调节不平等就是另一回事了。被剥夺财产的人不会倾向于创造和捍卫它。大多数人不能关心少数人的特权。为了保护“资产阶级法律”，工人国家被迫创建了一种“资产阶级”类型的工具——也就是说，同样的老警察，尽管穿着新制服。 （托洛茨基，1991：47） 然后，除了消费不平等的问题外，还有关于生产力发展水平低下的问题。国家必须促进生产力的发展（无论是为了“整个社会”还是为了经济上占主导地位的阶级）。如果推翻了私有财产，但生产力发展水平低下部分是由于革命过渡的孤立性和后革命社会内部的官僚主义导致的，构成了一种“联合发展”的形式，其中先进的社会关系（即，指向社会主义过渡的关系）与相对落后的经济发展水平并存，普通人无法享有足够的生活资料怎么办？ 国家的性质不仅仅是由私有财产关系来解释的。相对经济落后也可能导致国家的持续再生产。这是一个相对被忽略的主题，包括列宁。 列宁完全基于马克思关于无产阶级专政的理论，并未成功地就经济落后和国家孤立性的特征得出关于国家性质的所有必要结论。列宁将官僚主义的复兴归因于大众对行政管理的不熟悉和战争造成的特殊困难，该计划[即列宁的社会主义计划]仅仅规定了克服“官僚主义扭曲”的政治措施：随时选举和召回所有全权代表，废除物质特权，群众的积极控制等等。人们认为，沿着这条路线，官僚将从一个老板变成一个简单的而且还是临时的技术代理人，国家将逐渐而不知不觉地从现场消失。 （托洛茨基，1991：49-50; 斜体添加） 国家的阶级理论有一些实际的意义。其中之一是，只要阶级关系存在，国家——其主要任务是政治上压迫大众——就会存在。因此，推翻阶级关系，包括财产关系，以及推翻现有的国家是实现无阶级无国家社会的必要条件。还有另一个含义与最后一个相关。如果国家随着阶级分化而兴起，如果因此在原始的（“原始”）无阶级社会中没有国家，那意味着人们可以在一个无阶级且在经济上比现在或过去的任何社会形式都更发达的未来社会中管理他们的事务，而不需要国家。 对于恩格斯来说，族规所揭示的可能性是马克思主义关于未来共产主义社会中国家消亡的愿景不是混乱的食谱的重要保证，正如他的对手们所辩论的那样。 （布洛赫，1983：82） 然而，历史经验表明，在1917年以后的社会中，国家仍然是一个对普通人来说非常有力的代理人。正如我们所见，这可以基于国家的阶级理论来解释。"},{"prompt":"请将“4 The state’s internal relation with capitalism and capitalists Having explained the nature of the state at the level of class relations, I will now explore the different dimensions of the capitalist state in this chapter and the next eight chapters. Let us begin with where Marx ended in Capital volume 1. Marx (1887: 542) ended his book with a clarion call for ‘the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the people’, that is, expropriation of the capitalists. Why did he do so? Why did he not think that the state could eliminate the problems created by capitalist production and exchange based on capitalist private property? Given that humanity suffers from a large number of intractable problems such as poverty, inequality, precarity, unemployment, ill health, environmental degradation, and so on, we must ask, ‘Why can the capitalist state, which is supposed to meet the common needs of society, not make the capitalists address these problems?’ One explanation is that the state itself depends on capitalist accumulation. This idea appears to be in some of the writings of Marx1: To this modern [i.e. capitalist] private property corresponds the modern State, which, purchased gradually by the owners of property by means of taxation, has fallen entirely into their hands, and its existence has become wholly dependent on the commercial credit which the owners of property, the bourgeois, extend to it, as reflected in the rise and fall of State funds on the stock exchange. (Marx and Engels, 1845) Further: With the development and accumulation of bourgeois property, i.e., with the development of commerce and industry, individuals grew richer and richer while the state fell ever more deeply into debt. It is therefore obvious that as soon as the bourgeoisie has accumulated money, the state has to beg from the bourgeoisie and in the end it is actually bought up by the latter Even after the state has been bought up, it still needs money and, therefore, continues to be dependent on the bourgeoisie. In more recent times, some scholars have argued that the capitalist state cannot do this or that for the ordinary people because the capitalist class constrains state’s actions, as discussed in Chapter 2. For example, it is argued that the state, which depends on the capitalist class for its own survival, cannot subject the capitalists to much regulation (including taxation) because, if this happens, then the capitalists will geographically move their investment or will go on an investment strike. David Harvey (2010b: 197) says: The ‘success’ of a particular state (national or local) is often measured by the degree to which it captures flows of capital, builds the conditions favourable to further capital accumulation within its borders and achieves a high quality of daily life for its inhabitants. The implication of this is that the ability of the state to achieve a high quality of life for the people depends on its ability to capture flows of capital which is mobile and which is much more mobile than it was during Marx’s times. Similarly, Chris Harman (1991) says: The state has to adjust to the needs of particular capitals because it depends on them for the resources — particularly the revenues from taxation . . .: if it goes against their interests, they can move their liquid assets abroad. It is also said that the capitalists, or the people who share their ideology, occupy important positions within the state apparatuses and use the state in their own interests, so the state is helpless. The idea that the state depends on capitalists for taxes, loans, and so on, and that capitalist structure, or capitalists as individuals, constrains the state is true from the standpoint of the relatively concrete aspects of capitalist class society. But overall, this is an inadequate view underlying which is the ontology of external relation according to which the state and the capitalist class (including individual capitalists) exist as separate things, and they then interact. Another idea is that there are no inherent obstacles to — there are no inherent constraints on — the state being able to make capitalists serve the majority, that is, to implement reforms in the interests of the majority, and that therefore the obstacles can be removed by, say, adequate pressure from below (see Block, 2003). In other words, if the state does not meet people’s needs, it is because of the lack of adequate political pressure from below. This idea also presupposes an external relation — this time, an external relation between the state and, not the capitalist class, but the working class. The assumption here is that the state and the working class exist separately, and then the working class interacts with the state through its political pressure on it and that there is no inherent ‘bias’ of the capitalist state against the working class. The relation between the state and working class is an empirical relation, the strength of which varies across regions/countries and historical periods. All these approaches to the state based on the ontology of external relation between class and the state must be thoroughly contested. One must ask, ‘What is it that prohibits the state from forcing the capitalists, a tiny minority of people who monopolize over the means of production and subsistence, to do things that serve the majority?’ After all, the state possesses the monopoly over the coercive power of society (in the form of police, prisons, and the army, and so on), and it can easily use it against a tiny group of men and women in the interest of the vast majority. Or, at the minimum, and for the sake of an argument, what is it that bars the state from making capitalists produce things that people actually need and can afford and from making them provide secure employment with a living wage that is inflation-adjusted and ensure that capitalists’ rate of profit is no more than a given percentage? What stops the state from dispossessing this minority, which dispossesses and/ or exploits the majority, and from taking over the enterprises of the minority and running them, initially, at least, on behalf of common people and thereby eliminating state’s dependence on capitalist accumulation? What prevents the state from curtailing the capitalists’ ability for investment strike or their geographical mobility simply in order to accumulate more and more wealth? It is said that a law that increases tax on capitalists or that makes them pay higher wages will lead to capitalists moving their investment abroad or hiding their money outside of the boundary of the state. Here the assumption is that the state, for example, the state in the US, cannot do much about this. But then when states in the periphery take a small step to provide subsidized food to workers and small-scale producers or subsidized inputs and credit to farmers or to socialize some enterprises, how is it that international financial institutions (IMF and the like) are mobilized by the powerful states to discipline the peripheral states? And how is it that the combined military power of advanced states concentrated in, say, NATO, is deployed against individuals or groups of individuals or certain states that are said to be doing things against the interest of advanced states? Why can all states not take action against capitalists moving their money from, say, high tax areas or high minimum wages areas? Why can state power not be mobilized to ensure that capital cannot make use of geo-graphical difference across countries to play off one country against another? These and related questions are not ordinarily posed, but they need to be. To pose these questions requires that we use a different ontology of the relation between capitalists and the state. And to pose these questions and address them also, concomitantly, requires that we recognize that the matters of economics are deeply political and the matters of politics are deeply economic. In Section 1, I discuss the relation between the structure of the state and capitalism as an internal relation, including the idea that the state and capitalists are two arms of the same thing (= the totality of capitalist social relations). In Section 2, I discuss how the structure of the state operates within a series of limits, some of which are more stringent than others. In the concluding section, I critically reflect on the idea of the so-called separation of economic power from political power, arguing that economic power and political power are two sides of the same coin. In a sense, this chapter provides an overview of the entire theoretical discussion on the capitalist state in the book. 1 An internal relation between the state and the capitalist class If the state cannot abolish capitalist private property or if it cannot regulate cap-italists to make them serve the majority, it is not because capitalists as a class itself (barely top 1—10% of the population of a country) are so powerful politically vis-à-vis the state. The ultimate and fuller reason is somewhere else. Unpacking this reason requires a different ontological approach to the relation between the state and the capitalist class relation, that is, that we see their relation as an internal one rather than an external one. How the capitalist class and the proletariat class function is partly given by their respective political relation to the state, and not just by their mutual economic relation with one another (i.e. the fact that one class exploits another class). As mentioned before, the capitalist class controls the means of production and the surplus value, and it commands far more exchange value than the working class, and it is the class that ‘controls’ political power as well.2 Private property owners’ control over property is a political act and not just an economic act. Capitalists control the market and the workplace. And capitalists’ control is at the level of society as a whole. This means, among other things, that goods and services are produced for the sake of profit-making and that the quality of life of common people depends on that profit logic and on the decisions made by capitalists, while the needs of common people do not determine what gets produced and how they are produced (whether people can afford to consume what is produced and whether the method of production is healthy and ecologically sustainable). The various aspects of capitalists’ control are codified, protected, and defended by a coercive state.”翻译为中文","completion":"4 国家与资本主义及资本家的内在关系 在解释了国家在阶级关系层面的性质之后，我将在本章及接下来的八章中探讨资本主义国家的不同维度。让我们从马克思在《资本论》第一卷结束的地方开始。马克思（1887：542）以“少数篡夺者被人民大众所剥夺”这一响亮的号召结束了他的著作，即剥夺资本家。他为什么这么做？他为什么不认为国家可以消除基于资本主义私有财产的资本主义生产和交换所造成的问题？ 鉴于人类遭受着大量棘手问题，如贫困、不平等、不稳定性、失业、健康问题、环境退化等，我们必须问，“为什么资本主义国家，本应满足社会的共同需求，不能使资本家解决这些问题？”一个解释是国家本身依赖于资本主义积累。这个观点似乎出现在马克思的一些著作中: 对应于现代（即资本主义）私有财产的是现代国家，它逐渐被财产所有者通过税收购买，完全落入他们手中，它的存在完全依赖于财产所有者、即资产阶级给予它的商业信用，这反映在股票市场上国家基金的涨跌上。 （马克思和恩格斯，1845） 此外： 随着资产阶级财产的发展和积累，即随着商业和工业的发展，个体变得越来越富有，而国家却陷入了越来越深的债务。因此，很明显，一旦资产阶级积累了钱财，国家就不得不向资产阶级乞求，最终实际上被后者买断。即使国家被买断之后，它仍然需要钱财，因此，继续依赖于资产阶级。 在更近的时代，一些学者认为资本主义国家不能为普通人做这做那，是因为资本家阶级限制了国家的行动，如第二章所讨论的。例如，有人认为依赖于资本家阶级生存的国家不能对资本家实施太多的监管（包括税收），因为如果发生这种情况，那么资本家将在地理上转移他们的投资或将进行投资罢工。大卫·哈维（2010b：197）说： 一个特定国家（国家级或地方级）的“成功”通常根据其吸引资本流动、在其边境内建立有利于进一步资本积累的条件以及为居民提供高质量生活的程度来衡量。 这意味着国家为人民实现高质量生活的能力取决于其吸引资本流动的能力，而资本是流动的，比马克思时代更加流动。同样，克里斯·哈曼（1991）说： 国家不得不调整以满足特定资本的需求，因为它依赖于它们提供的资源——特别是税收收入...：如果它违背它们的利益，它们可以将流动资产转移到国外。 还有人说，资本家或持有他们意识形态的人占据了国家机构内的重要职位，并将国家用于自己的利益，因此国家束手无策。 国家依赖于资本家提供的税收、贷款等，而资本主义结构或资本家个人限制了国家，从资本主义阶级社会的相对具体方面来看，这是真实的。但总的来说，这是一种不充分的观点，其背后是将国家和资本家阶级（包括个别资本家）视为分离的外在关系观，然后它们之间发生相互作用。 另一个观点是，没有内在障碍——没有内在约束——于国家能够让资本家为多数服务，也就是说，为多数的利益实施改革，因此障碍可以通过，比如说，来自下方的充分压力来去除（参见Block，2003）。换句话说，如果国家不满足人民的需求，是因为缺乏来自下方的充分政治压力。这个观点同样假设了一种外在关系——这次是国家与工人阶级之间的外在关系。这里的假设是国家和工人阶级是分开存在的，然后工人阶级通过对其政治压力与国家互动，而资本主义国家对工人阶级没有内在的“偏见”。国家与工人阶级之间的关系是一个经验关系，其强度因地区/国家和历史时期而异。基于类与国家之间外在关系本体论的所有这些关于国家的方法都必须彻底争论。 人们必须问，“是什么阻止了国家强制占据生产和生活资料垄断地位的少数资本家为多数服务？”毕竟，国家拥有社会的强制力量垄断（以警察、监狱和军队等形式），它可以轻易地利用它针对一小群男男女女为绝大多数人的利益。或者，至少为了讨论的目的，是什么阻止了国家让资本家生产人们真正需求且能负担的东西，并为它们提供带有通胀调整的生活工资的安全雇佣，并确保资本家的利润率不超过给定的百分比？是什么阻止了国家剥夺这个剥夺和/或剥削大多数人的少数人，并接管少数人的企业，至少最初代表普通人运营，从而消除国家对资本主义积累的依赖？是什么阻止了国家简单地为了积累更多财富而限制资本家进行投资罢工或地理流动的能力？据说对资本家增税或让他们支付更高工资的法律将导致资本家将投资转移到国外或把钱藏在国家之外。这里的假设是，国家，例如美国的国家，对此无能为力。但是，当边缘地区的国家采取一小步为工人和小规模生产者提供补贴食品或为农民提供补贴的投入和信贷或对一些企业进行国有化时，国际金融机构（如IMF等）是如何被强大的国家动员起来约束边缘国家的？而且，当先进国家集中在例如北约的联合军事力量被部署对抗据说违背先进国家利益的个人或个人群体或某些国家时，情况又是怎样的？为什么所有国家不能对资本家将他们的钱从例如高税区或高最低工资区移走采取行动？为什么不能动员国家力量确保资本不能利用国家之间的地理差异来使一个国家对另一个国家不利？ 这些及相关问题通常不被提出，但它们需要被提出。提出这些问题要求我们使用不同的本体论来看待资本家与国家之间的关系。同时提出这些问题并解决它们，也需要我们认识到经济问题深深具有政治性，而政治问题深深具有经济性。 在第1节中，我讨论了国家结构与资本主义之间的内在关系，包括国家和资本家是同一事物（=资本主义社会关系的整体）的两个臂膀的观点。在第2节中，我讨论了国家结构在一系列限制下如何运作，其中一些比其他更为严格。在结论部分，我批判性地反思了所谓经济权力与政治权力分离的观念，争论经济权力和政治权力是同一硬币的两面。从某种意义上说，本章为本书对资本主义国家的整个理论讨论提供了一个概览。 1 国家与资本家阶级之间的内在关系 如果国家不能废除资本主义私有财产，或如果它不能规范资本家使他们为多数服务，不是因为资本家阶级本身（仅占一个国家人口的顶层1-10%）在政治上对国家来说太强大。最终和更全面的原因在别处。解开这个原因需要我们采用不同的本体论方法来看待国家与资本家阶级关系，也就是，我们将他们的关系视为内在关系而不是外在关系。 资产阶级和无产阶级的功能部分取决于它们各自与国家的政治关系，而不仅仅是它们之间的相互经济关系（即一个阶级剥削另一个阶级的事实）。如前所述，资产阶级控制着生产资料和剩余价值，它拥有远超工人阶级的交换价值，它也是“控制”政治权力的阶级。私有财产所有者对财产的控制是一个政治行为，而不仅仅是经济行为。资本家控制市场和工作场所。而且资本家的控制是在整个社会层面上的。这意味着，生产商品和服务是为了盈利，而普通人的生活质量取决于那个利润逻辑以及资本家所做的决定，而普通人的需求并不决定什么被生产以及如何被生产（无论人们是否有能力消费所生产的东西，以及生产方法是否健康和生态可持续）。资本家控制的各个方面由强制性国家进行编码、保护和辩护。"},{"prompt":"请将“The obverse side of the capitalist class control over economy and the state is the fact that the class of proletarians lacks control over property, surplus value, and indeed labour process itself. And the class that lacks economic control lacks control over state power: it experiences powerlessness or the relative lack of power. The proletariat is not just a class which is economically exploited and lives a precarious life. It is also a class which is politically oppressed/dominated. And this political oppression/domination is not just in the sphere of exchange relations (e.g. labour market) and in the sphere of work relation, but also at the level of society as a whole. The state is to be seen as being ‘constitutive’ of the totality of the class relation between capitalists and workers in a specific (relatively concrete) sense, while it is the case that class relations explain the state more than the state explaining the class relations. The capitalist class relation and the state have a ‘symmetrical’ internal relation: one cannot exist without the other. This means that the nature of the basic classes, or how they function, depends partly on their relation to the state and that the state is what it is because of its relation to each of these classes and to the relation between these classes. In other words, the state is internally related to the relation between capitalists and workers as the two basic classes of capitalist society.3 In the capitalist class society, as in other class societies, the relation between classes is (a) the sum of the relation between the state and all classes in a society and (b) the relation between each of the classes and the state. The class relation is a totality. It is the whole system of economic and political (and discursive) relationship between the entire capitalist class, and the entire working class (and other classes such as small-scale producers), a system that is supported by the capitalist state. The internal relation between the capitalist state and the capitalist class means that they are two arms of the social relationship called capitalist class relation. One arm signifies the exploitation of the majority and its (near) separation from property, and wealth-accumulation in the hands of the capitalists. Another arm signifies the political oppression/subjugation of the majority by the state. In other words, one arm signifies the capitalist class as a whole, and another arm signifies the state which is, above all, the coercive instrument to reproduce the capitalist class relations. To think about the state as an internal relation of capitalism is to examine the state at a definite level of analysis (the level of appropriators of surplus value as such), and then the various types of such appropriators (the diverse capitalist fractions). The state is, more or less, the political affairs department of the rule of the capitalist class (surplus value appropriators) in the modern society. The bourgeois state is the capitalist class which is organized as the ruling class: ‘[P]olitical power is precisely the official expression of [class] antagonism in civil society’ (Marx, 1987: 149). The capitalist state is a specific form — political form — of the very existence of the capitalist class. It is true that relative to pre-capitalist property owners, the capitalist property owners are less constrained by the state, and this means that ‘[t]hrough the emancipation of private property from the community, the State has become a separate entity, beside and outside civil society’ (Marx and Engels, 1845). Yet the state ‘is nothing more than the form of organisation which the bourgeois necessarily adopt both for internal and external purposes, for the mutual guarantee of their property and interests’ (ibid.). With the gradual progress of modern industry, ‘the class antagonism between capital and labor’ intensifies, and with this, the state power, more and more, assumes ‘the character of the national power of capital over labor, of a public force organized for social enslavement, of an engine of class despotism’, as Marx (1871a: 23) says in his Civil War in France. The content of social power (class power) of capitalists is expressed in the form of state power. To the extent that political power is the official/public expression of class antagonism, political oppression of the working class as a class is an inherent part of the nature and experience of that class. Separated from the mechanisms of control over the means of production, the working class is exploited by the capitalist class which monopolistically controls the means of production: this is a large part of the very essence of the capitalist class relation. But that is not all, because there can be no monopoly over the instruments of production, nor can there be any exploitation (i.e. monopoly over surplus labour/product), without the instrument of exploitation. More than anything else, the capitalist state is that instrument of exploitation. It is a weapon of the capitalist class against the masses. This is not necessarily in the sense of the state being used by capitalist class people on the basis of ties between them and state actors. The association between the capitalist class and the state has been indeed close historically and not just logically. In fact, ‘[e]ach step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class’ (Marx and Engels, 1848: 15). Itself an ‘oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility’, ‘the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway’ (ibid.), without which its economic exploitation of the common people would not be possible. Yet, while the capitalist class has political sway over the state, it denies the working class the right to fight for the status of the first class (the dominant class) in society. In many societies, at a given point in time, this or that political party (or this or that coalition of parties) of the capitalist class manages the common affairs of the state and of the capitalist class as a whole (led by a dominant capitalist fraction). But this does not mean that the state is not under the control of the capitalist class, any more than individual members of the working class being able to change their capitalist employers on a regular basis means that they, as a class, are not subjugated to, and exploited by, the capitalist class as a whole. The different political parties are, more or less, the slightly different mechanisms through which the economic interests of the different fractions of the capitalist class and of the whole class are politically represented. America’s Republican Party and the Democratic Party, or India’s Congress party and the BJP, are both parties of the bourgeoisie, with trivial differences between them in terms of the economic policies they pursue on behalf of the capitalist class. This is the case even if one party favours certain capitalists over other capitalists or can be slightly more conciliatory to the masses than another party. Once the capitalist class is the dominant political class, it is more or less the case that ‘[t]he executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie’ (Marx and Engels, 1848: 15). The management of common affairs includes the defence of bourgeoisie’s property ownership against the potential/actual political resistance from the masses and ensuring general conditions for accumulation of capital even if that means a massive economic cost to the masses. The interests of the masses are fundamentally incompatible with the interests of the capitalists, and therefore the state must always threaten violence, or use violence, when necessary, in order to protect the interests of the capitalists. The imperative of the management of common affairs of the capitalist class also means that the state can go against the interests of specific capitalists if their individual interests appear to go against the long-term interests of the capitalist class and/or against the political interests of the party in power. The processes of wealth accumulation in the hands of capitalists that the state must support go right against the interest of people, the direct producers (wage workers and non-exploiting small-scale producers). This is responsible for class struggle on their part (actual and potential), which in turn prompts class struggle from above — class struggle from above by the state on behalf of the exploiting class or the class struggle of the exploiting class implemented through the state. Often, the class struggle from above necessitates state violence. Thus, the ways in which the state defends capitalist property rights and contributes to capitalist accumulation create conditions for, and require, violence. Not surprisingly, Lenin (1949) describes the state as a special coercive force, a force that belongs to the exploiting classes and is used against the exploited classes. In fact, the essence of the state is that it defends capitalist property rights, including the right to exploit, and subjugates the people by the use, or threat of use, of violence: ‘[T]he bourgeois pay their state well . . . so that without risk they should be able to pay poorly; by good payment they ensure that the state servants are a force available for their protection — the police’ (Marx and Engels, 1845). The essence of the state is not merely political though, that is, the fact that it resorts to violence. The essence of the state is that it resorts to violence in the interest ofthe exploiting class, that is, to ensure class exploitation. As Engels (1884: chapter 9) says, ‘the modern representative state is the instrument for exploiting wage-labor by capital’, under normal conditions.4 The capitalist class that the state supports is a small minority class. To sustain the rule of a tiny minority over the vast majority, state power is essential, and state power takes the form of violence, actual or potential.”翻译为中文","completion":"资本家阶级对经济和国家的控制的反面是无产阶级缺乏对财产、剩余价值，甚至劳动过程本身的控制。缺乏经济控制的阶级也缺乏对国家权力的控制：它体验到了无力感或相对缺乏力量。无产阶级不仅仅是一个在经济上被剥削、生活不稳定的阶级。它还是一个在政治上被压迫/支配的阶级。这种政治压迫/支配不仅仅存在于交换关系（例如劳动市场）和工作关系的领域，而且存在于整个社会层面上。 国家被视为构成资本家和工人之间阶级关系整体性的“构成性”因素，虽然阶级关系比国家对阶级关系的解释更能解释国家。资本家阶级关系和国家有一个“对称”的内在关系：没有其中一个就不存在另一个。这意味着基本阶级的性质或它们的功能部分地取决于它们与国家的关系，而国家之所以是它的样子，是因为它与这些阶级之间以及这些阶级之间的关系。换句话说，国家与作为资本主义社会两个基本阶级的资本家和工人之间的关系有内在联系。在资本主义阶级社会中，就像在其他阶级社会中一样，阶级之间的关系是（a）国家与社会中所有阶级之间关系的总和，以及（b）每个阶级与国家之间的关系。阶级关系是一个整体。它是整个资本家阶级和整个工人阶级（以及其他阶级，如小规模生产者）之间经济、政治（和话语）关系的整个系统，这个系统得到资本主义国家的支持。 资本主义国家与资本家阶级之间的内在关系意味着它们是称为资本家阶级关系的社会关系的两条臂膀。一条臂膀象征着对多数人的剥削和它们（几乎）与财产的分离，以及财富在资本家手中的积累。另一条臂膀象征着国家对多数人的政治压迫/征服。换句话说，一条臂膀象征着整个资本家阶级，另一条臂膀象征着国家，国家首先是重现资本家阶级关系的强制工具。将国家视为资本主义的内在关系是在一定的分析层面（即剩余价值占有者本身的层面）考察国家，然后是这些占有者的各种类型（不同的资本家派别）。 国家或多或少是现代社会中资本家阶级（剩余价值占有者）统治的政治事务部门。资产阶级国家是作为统治阶级组织起来的资本家阶级：“政治权力正是民间社会中[阶级]对立的官方表达”（马克思，1987：149）。资本主义国家是资本家阶级存在的特定形式——政治形式。相对于前资本主义的财产所有者，资本主义的财产所有者受到国家的约束较少，这意味着“通过私有财产从社区的解放，国家已成为一个独立的实体，位于并在民间社会之外”（马克思和恩格斯，1845）。然而，国家“不过是资产阶级为了内部和外部目的、为了彼此保证其财产和利益而不得不采纳的组织形式”（同上）。随着现代工业的逐步进步，“资本和劳动之间的阶级对立”加剧，随之而来，国家权力越来越多地呈现为“资本对劳动的国家力量、为社会奴役组织起来的公共力量、阶级专制的工具”的特征，正如马克思在《法兰西内战》中所述（1871a：23）。 资本家的社会权力（阶级权力）的内容以国家权力的形式表现出来。政治权力是阶级对立的官方/公共表达，到了这个程度，对工人阶级作为一个阶级的政治压迫是该阶级性质和经验的固有部分。从对生产资料控制机制的剥夺中，工人阶级被垄断控制生产资料的资本家阶级所剥削：这是资本家阶级关系的本质的一大部分。但那并不是全部，因为如果没有剥削工具，就不可能有对生产工具的垄断，也就不可能有任何剥削（即对剩余劳动/产品的垄断）。资本主义国家比任何东西都是那种剥削工具。它是资本家阶级对抗大众的武器。这不一定是指基于资本家阶级人士与国家行为者之间的联系，由资本家阶级使用国家的意义。 资本家阶级与国家之间的联系在历史上确实很密切，不仅仅是逻辑上。实际上，“资产阶级的每一步发展都伴随着该阶级相应的政治进步”（马克思和恩格斯，1848：15）。作为“在封建贵族统治下的一个受压迫阶级”，“自从现代工业和世界市场的建立以来，资产阶级在现代代议制国家中为自己赢得了独家政治统治权”（同上），没有这个，它对普通人的经济剥削就不可能实现。然而，尽管资产阶级在国家上有政治统治权，它却否认工人阶级为社会中的第一阶级（主导阶级）而斗争的权利。 在许多社会中，特定时期这个或那个资产阶级的政党（或这个或那个党派联盟）管理着国家和整个资产阶级的共同事务（由一个主导的资本家派别领导）。但这并不意味着国家不受资本家阶级的控制，就像工人阶级的个别成员能够定期更换他们的资本主义雇主并不意味着他们作为一个阶级没有受到整个资本家阶级的征服和剥削。不同的政治党派或多或少是通过其经济利益被政治代表的不同的资本家阶级各派别和整个阶级的稍有不同的机制。美国的共和党和民主党，或印度的国大党和人民党，都是资产阶级的党派，就它们代表资产阶级追求的经济政策而言，他们之间的区别微不足道。即使一个政党比另一个政党更偏袒某些资本家或对大众稍微更和解，情况也是如此。 一旦资产阶级成为主导政治阶级，或多或少的情况是“现代国家的执行机关不过是管理整个资产阶级共同事务的委员会”（马克思和恩格斯，1848：15）。管理共同事务包括保卫资产阶级的财产所有权免受大众潜在/实际政治抵抗的侵犯，即使这意味着给大众带来巨大的经济成本，也要确保资本积累的总体条件。大众的利益与资本家的利益根本不兼容，因此国家必须始终威胁使用暴力，或在必要时使用暴力，以保护资本家的利益。管理资产阶级共同事务的必要性也意味着，如果特定资本家的个人利益看起来与资本家阶级的长期利益和/或执政党的政治利益相悖，国家可以违背特定资本家的利益。 国家必须支持的资本家手中财富积累的过程直接违背了人民、直接生产者（工资工人和非剥削小规模生产者）的利益。这是他们部分的阶级斗争（实际和潜在）的原因，这反过来又促使了自上而下的阶级斗争——国家代表剥削阶级或通过国家实施的剥削阶级的阶级斗争。通常，自上而下的阶级斗争需要国家暴力。因此，国家捍卫资本主义财产权和促进资本积累的方式创造了暴力的条件，并需要暴力。不出所料，列宁（1949）将国家描述为一种特殊的强制力量，属于剥削阶级并用来对抗被剥削阶级的力量。实际上，国家的本质是它捍卫资本主义财产权，包括剥削权，通过使用或威胁使用暴力来征服人民：“资产阶级给他们的国家支付得很好......以便他们可以安心地低薪支付；通过高薪确保国家公务员是为他们保护的力量——警察”（马克思和恩格斯，1845）。 国家的本质不仅仅是政治上的，也就是说，它诉诸于暴力。国家的本质在于它以剥削阶级的利益使用暴力，也就是保证阶级剥削。正如恩格斯（1884：第9章）所说，“现代代表性国家是资本利用工资劳动的工具”，在正常条件下。国家所支持的资本家阶级是一个小众阶级。为了维持少数人对绝大多数人的统治，国家权力是必不可少的，国家权力采取暴力的形式，实际的或潜在的。"},{"prompt":"请将“2 Limits on the state’s functioning It is in the very nature of capitalist state power that it will fundamentally protect the interests of the capitalist class. This fact — the fundamental class character of the state — sets limits on the state functioning. There are three limits. In the outermost (maximum) limit, by using its coercive powers (and/or by the threat of use of these powers), the state must ensure commodity relations and the right of the capitalist class to own property in its specifically capitalist form: to buy and sell for profit, to appropriate surplus (whether in production or outside), to dispossess the small-scale producers, and so on. Then come two inner limits. One is that the state must create consent to its rule and bourgeois class rule in the minds of the masses by giving material concessions and by ideological conditions (education, propaganda, identity politics, and the like), for the continued existence of capitalism. And note that repeated use of violence and repeated threat of the use of violence tend to produce consent to the system out of fear. Within limits, the state can allow for the diversity of ideas that people learn, including some criticisms of capitalism and the state (and of capitalist parties), but the state cannot tolerate a situation, or promote a situation, where the majority become anti-capitalist in their ideology from the standpoint of abolishing capitalism. Similarly, within limits the state can provide some material concessions but not to the extent that the reliance of common people on the capitalist class is significantly reduced, allowing them to stop being wage labourers. The other inner limit concerns the economic interventions of the state (dis-cussed in detail in Chapter 7): this exists because of the fact that it is not enough that the state defends capitalist private property rights or creates conditions where people believe in the sanctity of capitalist property rights and of commodity relations. The state must ensure conditions for accumulation within the framework of capitalist property relation and subordinate the needs of the masses to the logic of profit-making. Marx (1894: 573) says in Capital volume 3 that ‘the development of the interests of capital and of the capitalist class, of capitalist production, forms the foundation of national power and national ascendancy in modern society’ and that ‘the interests of the capitalist class and the amassing of riches in general’ are pronounced ‘to be the ultimate aim of the state’. While both capitalists and misers seek to enrich themselves, there is a difference between them: the capitalist class, unlike the miser, is subjected by the coercive economic mechanism of competition to a ‘boundless drive for enrichment’ and a ‘passionate chase after value’. It must therefore constantly invest money to expand money. In fact, when the system seems to come to a halt (as in a crisis), the state starts making sure that, for example, the rate of exploitation of the working class, including by imperialist oppression, is heightened in order to create fresh ground for raising the rate of profit. Although each state carries out its capitalist functions generally within its geographical area ofjurisdiction, the more powerful states — imperialist states — exercise their powers more globally (more on this in Chapter 11). The degree of stringency of the limits increases as one moves from the innermost to the outermost limit and especially when class struggle intensifies. No matter what, and even if the state is unable to adequately help the capitalist class to accumulate wealth (or indeed to feed the common people), it must protect its capitalists’ right to control property and to exploit the men and the women it employs. The capitalist state is not in the business of getting rid of property rights of owners of (big) business as a whole. The limits are inter-related: ensuring conditions of accumulation resulting in some economic growth and employment not only helps capitalists economically. State-enabled economic growth produces finances (through taxes, for example) to fund such things as poverty alleviation and employment generation.5 The latter measures in turn help the state minimize the threat to capitalist property rights and thus legitimize itself. Given the internal relation between the dominant class and the state by virtue of which the state must promote capitalist accumulation and respond to class struggle, its actual concrete interventions may vary from time to time and may not always have the intended effect. So the actual policy interventions are driven by mechanisms that are more concrete than the internal relation discussed earlier: there are different concrete ways, to be explored in concrete research, in which the state meets the needs of the capitalist class. Different capitalist fractions have different conceptions of what accumulation strategy is, and in part because of this, personal and institutional relation between state actors and capitalists or their organizations is important. So are institutional relations (e.g. relations between the chambers of commerce and the state actors). In other words, the actual ways in which the state serves the capitalists are mediated by the agency of individual capitalists or groups of capitalists as well as state actors action (discussed in Chapter 8). State functions are also impacted by the state’s forms, both geographical form, and state form in terms of whether it is, for example, democratic or fascistic. Finally, as explained in Chapter 11, the relation between the state and capitalism is impacted by capitalist class relation at the scale of the world market (that is, by imperialism) and therefore has a degree of specificity in the context of the LDCs. 3 Summary, and theoretical and political implications The argument made in this chapter that there is an internal relation between the state and the capitalist class goes against the excessive emphasis placed within Marxism on the separation of the political from the economic. The separation is more apparent than real. The idea of the separation means that individual capitalists generally do not need to exercise extra-economic coercion against other capitalists or against their workers in economic transactions. Creaven (2000; see also Wood, 2012) says that ‘the structural configuration of capitalist relations of production’, that is, the separation of the direct producers from access to the means of production, ‘enables their routine reproduction by economic mechanisms without the continual intervention or threat of intervention of politico-military force in the class struggle’ (ibid.). This approach, in my view, while it captures a part of the reality, is deficient: it sees capitalism and its state not only from the standpoint of individual capitalists rather than as a class, but also from the standpoint of pre-capitalist societies. In pre-capitalist societies, individual owners of property (e.g. feudal lords) have political power by virtue of having control over property, a situation that is different from capitalism, where individual capitalists as capitalist property-owners do not possess public political power merely by virtue of being capitalists. But the capitalist class as a whole, by virtue of their control over property, does exercise political, cultural, and juridical functions in the lives of the masses (Eagleton, 1991: 113) in the sense that these functions are collectively performed by the collective capitalist, the state. Note that at the level of the capitalist class as a whole, the working class has no choice not to work for a wage, and it cannot choose between capitalist and non-capitalist employers. The implication for the state of this unfreedom of the working class vis-à-vis the capitalist class is under-emphasized. The internal relation between the state (political power) and those who control property has important theoretical and political implications. Firstly, the internal relation thesis does not mean that capitalists and those who manage their common affairs within the state (politicians and bureaucrats) are one class (this is discussed in some details in Chapter 8). Secondly, to say that the state is the dominant part would be like saying that security officers that guard capitalists’ property are the real owners of the property which the capitalists enjoy for a fee (to paraphrase a point Marx made, to which I will return later). In fact, ‘the bourgeois do not allow the state to interfere in their private interests beyond a point and give it only as much power as is necessary for their own safety and the maintenance of competition’ (ibid.). Thirdly, and related to the last point, the internal relation thesis raises the matter of the distinction between economic and political power. Those people who talk about merely economic power of capitalists do so in order ‘to sidestep the question of how to transform society without the conquest of state power’ (Trotsky, 1977: 121). In fact, ‘the distinction between political and economic power . . . [is a] terminological trap’: ‘Economic power’, as such, does not exist. There is property, different forms of property. State power provides the opportunity to retain, or on the contrary, to abolish capitalist property, depending on whether state power belongs to the bourgeoisie or to the proletariat. (ibid.) The capitalist class relation is intimately a political relation between the state and the totality of class relations and between the state and capitalist class interests. If political power is really ‘the most concentrated strength of the ruling class’ and serves the economic interests of the capitalist class and big landowners, then what is on the agenda is the seizure of political power through revolution against the state and not a never-ending pursuit of mere democratization and humanization of the state. The nature of state power is political, and political power is important. Indeed, ‘[w]hy do we fight for the political dictatorship of the proletariat if political power is economically impotent? Force (that is, state power) is also an economic power’ (Engels, in Marx and Engels, 1975: 402). The class rule is based on, and supported by, the state that uses its claimed monopoly of means of violence in support of the class that monopolizes the means of production. Because the interests of this class and the interests of the masses are irreconcilable (which is why the state exists), so replacing the rule of capitalist class cannot be a peaceful method: The class theory of society and historical experience equally testify to the impossibility of the victory of the proletariat through peaceful methods, that is, without grandiose class battles, weapons in hand. (Trotsky, 1933; italics added)”翻译为中文","completion":"2 国家功能的局限性 资本主义国家权力的本质在于它将基本上保护资本家阶级的利益。这一事实——国家的根本阶级性——对国家的运作设定了限制。这里有三个限制。在最外层（最大）限制中，国家必须使用其强制权力（和/或使用这些权力的威胁），确保商品关系和资本家阶级拥有其特定资本主义形式的财产权：为了利润而买卖、占有剩余（无论是在生产中还是在生产之外）、剥夺小规模生产者等。然后是两个内部限制。一是国家必须通过给予物质让步和意识形态条件（教育、宣传、身份政治等），在大众心目中创造对其统治和资产阶级统治的认同，以维持资本主义的持续存在。请注意，反复使用暴力和对使用暴力的反复威胁往往会出于恐惧产生对体制的认同。在限制之内，国家可以允许人们学习思想的多样性，包括对资本主义和国家（以及资本主义政党）的一些批评，但国家不能容忍或促进大多数人从废除资本主义的立场上变得反资本主义。同样，在限制之内，国家可以提供一些物质让步，但不能到使普通民众对资本家阶级的依赖显著减少、让他们停止成为雇佣劳动者的程度。 另一个内部限制涉及国家的经济干预（详细讨论见第7章）：这存在的原因是单单国家捍卫资本主义私有财产权或创造民众相信资本主义财产权和商品关系神圣性的条件是不够的。国家必须在资本主义财产关系的框架内确保积累的条件，并将大众的需求置于盈利逻辑之下。马克思在《资本论》第三卷中说，“资本和资本家阶级的利益、资本主义生产的发展，在现代社会形成了国家权力和国家优势的基础”，并且“资本家阶级的利益和一般的财富积累”被宣布为“国家的最终目标”（1894：573）。 虽然资本家和守财奴都寻求致富，但他们之间存在差异：与守财奴不同，资本家阶级受到竞争的强制性经济机制的制约，有着“无限的致富驱动”和“对价值的热情追求”。因此，它必须不断地投资资金以扩大资金。事实上，当系统似乎陷入停滞（如在危机中），国家开始确保，例如，提高对工人阶级的剥削率，包括通过帝国主义压迫，以创造提高利润率的新基础。尽管每个国家通常在其地理管辖区域内执行其资本主义职能，但更强大的国家——帝国主义国家——在全球范围内行使其权力（第11章将进一步讨论）。 随着从最内层到最外层限制的过渡，局限性的严格程度增加，特别是当阶级斗争加剧时。不管发生什么，即使国家无法充分帮助资本家阶级积累财富（或确实无法养活普通民众），它必须保护其资本家的财产控制权和剥削其雇佣的男女的权利。资本主义国家并不从事取消（大）企业所有者的财产权的业务。这些限制是相互关联的：确保积累条件导致的一些经济增长和就业不仅在经济上帮助了资本家。国家促进的经济增长通过税收等方式产生财政收入，用于资助贫困缓解和就业创造等事务。而后者措施反过来帮助国家最小化对资本主义财产权的威胁，从而使自己合法化。 鉴于占主导地位的阶级与国家之间存在的内在关系，国家必须促进资本主义积累并应对阶级斗争，其实际的具体干预可能会随时间而变化，而且并不总是能够达到预期效果。因此，实际的政策干预是由比之前讨论的内在关系更具体的机制驱动的：国家满足资本家阶级需求的不同具体方式需在具体研究中探索。不同的资本家派别对什么是积累战略有不同的看法，部分原因是这样，国家行为者与资本家或其组织之间的个人和制度关系很重要。机构关系（例如商会与国家行为者之间的关系）也同样重要。换句话说，国家服务于资本家的实际方式是通过资本家个人或资本家群体以及国家行为者的行动的中介来实现的（将在第8章讨论）。国家职能还受到国家的形式影响，包括地理形式和国家形式，比如它是民主的还是法西斯主义的。最后，如第11章所解释的，国家与资本主义之间的关系受到世界市场规模下的资本主义阶级关系（即帝国主义）的影响，因此在最不发达国家（LDCs）的背景下具有特定性。 3 总结及理论和政治含义 本章提出的观点是国家与资本家阶级之间存在内在关系，这与马克思主义内部对政治与经济分离的过分强调相反。这种分离更多的是表面上的而非实质上的。分离的观念意味着个别资本家通常不需要在经济交易中对其他资本家或其工人施加超经济的强制。Creaven（2000；参见Wood，2012）说，“资本主义生产关系的结构配置”，即直接生产者与生产资料的获取渠道的分离，“使得通过经济机制而非持续干预或政治-军事力量对阶级斗争的威胁来常态化再生产成为可能”（同上）。在我看来，这种方法虽然捕捉到了部分现实，却是不足的：它不仅从个别资本家而非作为一个阶级的视角，也从前资本主义社会的视角看待资本主义及其国家。在前资本主义社会中，财产所有者（例如封建领主）因控制财产而拥有政治权力，这与资本主义不同，在资本主义中，个别资本家作为资本主义财产所有者并不仅仅因为他们是资本家就拥有公共政治权力。但作为一个整体，资本家阶级凭借其对财产的控制，确实在大众生活中行使政治、文化和司法职能（Eagleton，1991：113），这些职能是由集体资本家——国家——集体执行的。请注意，在资本家阶级整体的层面上，工人阶级没有选择不为工资工作的余地，也不能在资本主义和非资本主义雇主之间选择。这种工人阶级相对于资本家阶级的不自由状态对国家的影响被低估了。 国家（政治权力）与那些控制财产的人之间的内在关系具有重要的理论和政治含义。首先，内在关系论并不意味着资本家和那些在国家内部管理他们共同事务的人（政客和官僚）是同一个阶级（这在第8章中有详细讨论）。第二，说国家是主导部分就像说保卫资本家财产的安全人员是资本家享受财产的真正所有者一样（套用马克思提出的一个观点，我将稍后回到这一点）。事实上，“资产阶级不允许国家超过一定程度干预他们的私人利益，并且只给予国家为了他们自己的安全和维护竞争所必需的权力”（同上）。 第三，与最后一点相关，内在关系论提出了经济权力和政治权力之间区别的问题。那些谈论资本家仅具有经济权力的人这么做是为了“回避在没有征服国家权力的情况下如何转变社会的问题”（托洛斯基，1977：121）。事实上，“政治权力与经济权力之间的区分...[是一个]术语陷阱”： “经济权力”本身并不存在。存在的是财产，不同形式的财产。国家权力提供了保留或相反，根据国家权力归属于资产阶级还是无产阶级，废除资本主义财产的机会。 （同上） 资本家阶级关系本质上是国家与阶级关系总体以及国家与资本家阶级利益之间的政治关系。如果政治权力确实是“统治阶级最集中的力量”，并且服务于资本家阶级和大地主的经济利益，那么议程上的是通过反对国家的革命夺取政治权力，而不是永无止境地追求仅仅是国家的民主化和人道化。国家权力的本质是政治性的，政治权力很重要。实际上，“如果政治权力在经济上无能为力，我们为什么要为无产阶级的政治专政而斗争？力量（即国家权力）也是一种经济力量”（恩格斯，在马克思和恩格斯，1975：402）。 阶级统治基于并得到国家的支持，国家声称拥有暴力手段的垄断权，以支持垄断生产资料的阶级。由于这个阶级的利益与大众的利益不可调和（这就是国家存在的原因），因此替换资本家阶级的统治不能是和平的方式： 社会的阶级理论和历史经验同样证明了无产阶级通过和平手段取得胜利的不可能性，即不通过宏大的阶级斗争，武器在手。 （托洛斯基，1933；斜体添加）"},{"prompt":"请将“Therefore, one must reject reformism as well as ‘the perspective of a peaceful transformation of capitalism into socialism’ (ibid.): In the last analysis, the theories of reformism, insofar as reformism generally has attained to theory, are always based upon the inability to understand that class antagonisms are profound and irreconcilable. 5 The state, capitalist commodity relations, and labour power Karl Marx memorably begins Capital volume 1, his magnum opus, with the following words: The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as ‘an immense accumulation of commodities,’ its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity. (Marx, 1887: 27) Could such an analysis of the commodity in the capitalist society point to an analysis of the capitalist state? The answer is yes. If capitalism is based on a world of commodities, including common people’s ability to work, for that very reason, it also presupposes state power without which commodity relations cannot exist on a scale that they do in capitalism. State power — both in terms of what the state does and what it does not — is very much implicit in Marx’s analysis of the commodity character of capitalism. I will build on his insights to explore the relation between the state and commodity relations. I also illustrate some of the ideas from Capital 1, by using empirical facts from different parts of the world, including from the Global South. In the first two sections, I relate the state to the three attributes of the commodity in capitalism (use-value, exchange value, and value). In Section 3, I discuss the state in relation to the nature of the peculiar commodity (labour power) in part by using the concept of what I call labour circuit. In the final section, I outline some implications of Marx’s ideas about the state and value relations for a future world beyond value and thus briefly connect Marx’s Capital 1 to the 20th-century (and more recent) discussion on the ability of the post-capitalist state to construct ‘socialism in one country’. 1 Use-value, exchange value, and the state Capitalism is characterized by the more or less free purchase and sale of com-modities. A commodity has three attributes: use-value, exchange value, and (labour) value. Use-value — the utility of a commodity — inheres in it. Exchange value is ‘the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort, a relation constantly changing with time and place’ (Marx, 1887: 27). One commodity can be exchanged for many. Value (or labour value) is the fact that every commodity represents a certain amount of socially necessary abstract labour time (explained later). I argue later that the state is related to each of the three aspects of the commodity. To the extent that the wealth of societies dominated by the capitalist mode of production appears as an ‘immense collection ofcommodities’ (Marx, 1887: 60), then the capitalist state — that ‘official representative of society as a whole’ (Engels, 1877) — must maintain the commodity form/status of things (of use-values). As inanimate objects, ‘[c]ommodities cannot go to market and make exchanges of their own account’ (Marx, 1887: 60). There must be ‘their guardians’ — that is, ‘their owners . . . who must place themselves in relation to one another, as persons whose will resides in those objects’ (ibid.). The state must ensure that commodity owners relate to one another on the basis of freedom and equality. In fact, the sphere of purchase and sale of commodities is ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of [human beings]’, and in this sphere ‘alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham’ (Marx, 1887: 123). There is freedom ‘because both buyer and seller of a commodity . . . contract as free agents, and the agreement they come to, is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will’ (ibid.; italics added). The state represents — embodies — this legal expression. There is equality because each guardian of commodity ‘enters into relation with the other, as with a simple owner of commodities, and they exchange equivalent for equivalent’ (ibid.). The state is supposed to make sure that there is no cheating and fraud. There is respect for property because each guardian of the commodity ‘disposes only of what is his own’ (ibid.). There is no scope for grabbing what belongs to someone else. In other words, the state makes sure that there is respect for property. And, of course, there is ‘Bentham, because each looks only to himself’ (ibid.). The only force that brings the guardians of commodities ‘together and puts them in relation with each other, is the selfishness, the gain and the private interests of each’ (ibid.). The state, more or less, reproduces and supports these values. All in all, the rule of ‘Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham’ (ibid.) creates opportunities for, and presupposes, state action, in the sense that the state is supposed to ensure this rule. The state is presupposed by commodity relations because of a positive (coor- dinative) and a negative (punitive) reason that Marx does not explicitly discuss. Firstly, in a society with a massive and expanding division of labour, concrete labours in different places throughout the world need to be inter-connected through exchange on the basis of abstract labour, so the state action is necessary to coordinate the myriad commodity relations. Commodity exchange implies a division of labour in society where different producers produce different commodities. This social division of labour (which is also a spatial division of labour) in turn requires ‘a division of labour’ between society and the state. The large-scale commodity exchange that is characteristic of capitalism and the fact that a commodity’s exchange values are ‘constantly changing with time and place’ (Marx, 1887: 27) require a society-level coordination in time-space. This task falls on the shoulders of the collective agency of the state. It is the state indeed which introduces various rules to support and sustain commodity relations in the overall interest of the ‘community’ of commodity owners and to resolve any conflict among them. It makes sure that the guardians — the commodity owners — ‘must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other, and part with his own, except by means of an act done by mutual consent’ and that ‘they must, therefore, mutually recognise in each other the right of private proprietors’ (Marx, 1887: 60). The relation between commodity owners as mediated by, and within, the state is a juridical relation: ‘This juridical relation . . . expresses itself in a contract, whether such contract be part of a developed legal system or not’ (ibid.). It is ‘a relation between two wills’ (ibid.). Although, the state is ‘the reflex of the real economical relation between the two’ (ibid.), state’s coordinative activities are crucial to the reproduction of commodity relations, including those that involve both capital and labour. There is also need to create a geographical built environment to connect different commodity producers located in different geographical sites of concrete labour. The state seeks to fulfil this communal or society-wide need. Secondly, there is a punitive reason why the state is presupposed by — necessary for — the existence of commodity relations. The rules of commodity exchange can be violated by the guardians of commodities whose self-interest (‘Benthamism’) lies in expanding their command over commodities (and over money, the most abstract ‘form’ of commodities), so punitive actions by the state may be necessary. Commodity owners are all equal in that they all have the same trait (they own commodities) and that they relate to one another on the basis of equality. Yet commodity relations can be unequal because some commodity owners, prior to any commodity exchange, may have more exchange value (e.g. more quantity of a given commodity or of its monetary value) than others, and in order to expand their command over commodities and to improve their status as commodity owners, some may inflict extra-commodity relations or unequal exchange on others and defraud them. To the extent that the defrauding happens with the help of extra-economic means (i.e. actual use, or threat of use, of coercion), commodity relations are political (extra-economic) matters and not just economic matters. There is therefore a need to ‘guard the guardians’ to make sure that a given guardian of the commodity does not force another to sell their commodity below the market price or part with their commodity against the wish of the owner. There is a need for a (political) guardian of the guardians (of economic commodities). The state is that guardian. Dominantly a site of extra-economic relations, the state must ensure that commodities are exchanged on the basis of economic relations, that is, without extra-economic coercion or without a significant quantity of extra-economic coercion. Commodity relations are not necessarily a peaceful matter. The state’s defence of existing commodity relations on the basis of freedom and equality contribute to unfreedom and inequality. There is unfreedom, including the fact that workers are not free not to sell their labour power to the capitalist class. There is inequality, including in the form of class differentiation among commodity producers, and inequality between the big business and small-scale owners.1 It is not just that state’s functions aim to codify/sustain/reproduce commodity relations. To some extent, the very existence of the capitalist state, that is, its separation from society, has something to do with the commodity form of use-values. In a world where everything is being turned into a commodity, it is useful to recall Pashukanis’ (1924) fundamental question about the nature of capitalist state: [W]hy does the dominance of a class not become that which it is, i.e. the actual subordination of one part of the population to another, but instead assumes the form of official state authority? Or, . . . why is the apparatus of state coercion created not as a private apparatus of the ruling class, but distinct from the latter in the form of an impersonal apparatus of public power distinct from society? The capitalist state form exists because of the generalized commodity character of society where commodity owners are free and equal and who are supervised by an abstract collective subject, the state. However, contrary to Pashukanis’ idea that commodity relations are associated with non-coercive action of the state,2 ‘disputation and contestation is intrinsic to the commodity, in the fact that its private ownership implies the exclusion of others’ (Mieville, 2005: 126), so ‘violence — coercion — is at the heart of the commodity form’. The reason is that [f]or a commodity meaningfully to be ‘mine-not-yours’ — which is, after all, central to the fact that it is a commodity to be exchanged — some forceful capabilities are implied. If there were nothing to defend its ‘mine-ness’, there would be nothing to stop it becoming ‘yours’, and then it would no longer be a commodity, as I would not be exchanging it.

So society is organized in such a way that it ‘constantly impels individuals, groups, classes and other collectivities’ to invade ‘the rights of others’. In other words, ‘[t]he motive to trespass, steal, invade, oppress, rob and generally transgress property right is continually recreated through the pressure of material need’ (Mieville, 2005: 127). Hence this system of social production relations generates a permanent and general requirement for means of ‘defence’, i.e. for means of violence and its organization. Without a constant threat and/or application of force, commodity production would stand in danger of rapid subversion and breakdown. (ibid.) Commodity exchange requires a medium of exchange, so the state ‘puts in circulation bits of paper on which their various denominations . . . are printed’ (Marx, 1887: 83). ‘Capital is nothing more . . . than money put back into production and circulation to yield more money. If money is to represent real values the same kind of State regulation of money supply and credit is called for’ (Harvey, 2012: 274). While necessary it might even take out of circulation certain currencies in circulation (de-monetization). Such a policy can have massive effect on common people.3 The state has to make sure that insofar as currencies ‘take the place of gold to the same amount, their movement is subject to the laws that regulate the currency of money itself’ (Marx, 1887: 83). It has to make sure that the money in circulation ‘must have an objective social validity of its own’: ‘This compulsory action of the State can take effect only within that inner sphere of circulation which is coterminous with the territories of the community’ (ibid.: 84). The state is also a guarantor of the stability of exchanges and therefore of the form of value (Callinicos, 1987a: 100). The state acts as the lender of last resort which prevents the collapse of the monetary order and banking systems. Commodity relations have a spatial — scalar — form, and this fact has implica-tions for the state. The commodity relations happen at multiple spatial scales. The global scale is very important for capitalism: ‘The production of commodities, their circulation, and that more developed form of their circulation’ which is called world-embracing commerce, or trade, ‘these form the historical ground-work from’ which capitalism rises (Marx, 1887: 85). Incidentally, this global character of capitalism means that the proletariat, essentially, has a global existence: The proletariat can . . . only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a ‘world-historical’ existence. World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history. (Marx and Engels, 1845) The world geography of trade indicates that capitalism is a global phenomenon from its very origin. Commodity owners engage in transactions with one another on a global space which is politically divided into multiple territories governed by their states, some of which are more powerful than others. The state shapes commodity exchange not only at the national scale. It also shapes commodity exchange at the global scale, including on the basis of imposition of customs duties.4 For a nation to sell its wares in another (distant) nation, the extra-economic state intervention is necessary. The national states of powerful merchants have contributed to commerce by helping merchants, by giving them charters and security.5 The sale of commodities from South Asia in England was heavily restricted by the British state in the 18th century in order to protect British industry. Thanks to the pressure of the British manufacturers on their government, By 1720, laws had been passed forbidding the wear or use of printed or dyed cotton cloth. In 1760 a lady had to pay a fine of £200 for possessing an imported handkerchief! Moreover, heavy duties were imposed on the import of plain cloth. (Chandra, 2009: 92) The British colonial state also forced people in the colonies to engage in com-modity exchange (for example, to produce indigo) where it did not exist and resisted any effort to preserve modes of production and subsistence not based on large-scale commodity exchange. Indeed, when powerful states perform the task of the guardian of commodity relations at the global level (to guard the other states guarding commodity rules in their territories) and when they impose commodity relations and/or impose unequal commodity exchange on ‘weaker’ countries, those powerful states become imperialist states (I will return to this topic in Chapter 11). Given the massive expansion of global trade and enormous movement of currencies, the need for guarding commodity relations becomes that much important, hence laws to promote ‘free trade’ (against, for example, state interference in economy). There are also laws against money-laundering.6 In capitalism, almost all the things produced are commodities (this is Marx’s assumption) or are subjected to commodification. But in reality, this is not true: not everything is a commodity, a few things are a commodity only partially, and the process of commodification is not a linear process. It is important to note that the commodity status of things is contested in part under pressure from common people who lack the means of exchange to buy the use-values that they need, so the state is partly involved in the determination of what is and what is not a commodity. Use-values (e.g. a vaccine) may be enjoyed in non-commodity or a semi-commodity form when the state supplies them for free or at a subsidized rate. Child care, for example, is a commodity here, and it is not a commodity there. As Martha Friendly (2019) notes, the commodity status of childcare exists to a much greater extent in North America and Australia than in Nordic countries. This geographical unevenness partly reflects the variation in the degree to which the commodity character of capitalism is contested, rather than taken for granted, by wage earners and small-scale producers, who lack an adequate command over exchange value and are therefore adversely affected if they have to pay for everything.7 The dominant aim of capitalist production is not to directly meet the needs of people. ‘Use-values are only produced by capitalists, because, and in so far as, they are the material substratum, the depositories of exchangevalue’ (Marx, 1887: 131). The capitalist’s aim is ‘to produce a use-value that has a value in exchange, that is to say, an article destined to be sold, a commodity’. Not just that. Their aim is ‘to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than the sum of the values of the commodities used in its production’ (ibid.), that is, a commodity which will give the capitalist a profit. Thus, capitalism abstracts from the nature of use-values. It is indifferent to whether a commodity is smelly or flavourful. It is even indifferent to whether a commodity is harmful to the body (if it is, say, cancerous) or to nature (increased toxicity in water or air). Whichever product can be sold more profitably, not necessarily what people need for a healthy life, will be produced and sold. This means that if a commodity c1 is more profitable than a commodity c2 but people’s needs are met better by c2, then largescale commodity producers resort to a curious commodity (i.e. advertising) to make people believe that they actually need to consume and buy c1. Often advertising spreads misinformation about commodities and creates unhealthy needs (e.g. tobacco) (Williams, 1980). This may prompt state intervention against such action, but there are limits to what the state can do (I return to this in the following). The fact that the motive of capitalist production is the production for exchange and not for meeting human need has another implication for the state: it imposes constraint on what the state can do for common people. The state, which claims to represent, and is often seen by many as representing, the general interests of society, fails to make sure that there are enough of the things that people actually need (e.g. nutritious food, shelter, protective equipment during a pandemic). The state has little control over the ways in which society’s total labour is allocated to the production of different things. As a result, whatever is available in the market is usually assumed to have some use. 2 Value relations and the state A commodity has many exchange values (e.g. a laptop can be exchanged for 100 pens or 10 shirts). Exchange values ‘are only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it’ (Marx, 1887: 27). Value is the ‘common substance that manifests itself in the exchange value of commodities’ (ibid.: 28). To say that commodities have value is to say, above all, that they are products of human labour, albeit human labour of a specific kind. A given thing/service ‘consists of the same unsubstantial reality’ (ibid.), a certain amount of labour power which exists irrespective of the concrete forms it takes (e.g. laptop-making labour or cane-making labour), that is, abstract labour, which is the stuff of value. The magnitude of value of an article is measured by ‘the quantity of the value-creating substance, the labour’, contained in that article (p. 29). The quantity of value-creating labour ‘is measured by its duration’ (e.g. weeks, days, and hours of labour) (ibid.). This does not mean that ‘the more idle and unskilful the labourer, the more valuable would [their] commodity be, because more time would be required in its production’ (ibid.). In fact, ‘[t]he labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time’ (ibid.) in a given territory (e.g. a country under the jurisdiction of a state).8 What determines the proportion in which one commodity is exchanged for many other commodities within a country or across countries is the social value (or simply, value) of the commodities: a socially necessary amount of abstract or homogenous labour performed under average conditions.9 The labour that defines value is socially necessary labour. ‘In general, the greater the productiveness of labour, the less is the labour time required for the production of an article, the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article, and the less is its value’ (Marx, 1887: 29—30). So the value of a commodity (v) ‘varies directly as the quantity (q), and inversely as the productiveness (p), of the labour incorporated in it’ (ibid.: 30). This productiveness is a function of the average amount of skill of the working men and women, the state of science and technology as well as the social organization of production and quality of the means of production (ibid.: 29). This productiveness is also a function of physical/natural conditions.10”翻译为中文","completion":"将分析从个体层面提升到社会层面，可以看到，维护商品关系必须有力量作为一般条件。“在商品生产中，‘需求’和‘权利’处于对立状态”，意味着“现存的财产关系”，这些还不是生产关系，“系统性地将生产者与他们需要的对象每天且持续地分开”。因此，社会以这样一种方式组织，它“不断地驱使个人、团体、阶级和其他集体”侵犯“他人的权利”。换句话说，“通过物质需求的压力，不断地重新创造侵犯、偷窃、侵略、压迫、抢夺和一般违反财产权的动机”（米维尔，2005：127）。 因此，这套社会生产关系产生了对‘防御’手段的永久和普遍需求，即对暴力及其组织手段的需求。如果没有持续的威胁和/或使用力量，商品生产将面临迅速颠覆和崩溃的危险。 （同上） 商品交易需要交换媒介，因此国家“使印有不同面额的纸币流通”（马克思，1887：83）。“资本无非是...为了赚取更多金钱而重新投入生产和流通的金钱。如果货币要代表真实价值，则需要同样的国家对货币供应和信贷的调控”（哈维，2012：274）。虽然有必要，国家甚至可能从流通中撤回某些货币（去货币化）。这样的政策对普通民众可能有巨大影响。国家必须确保，只要货币“代表相同数量的黄金，它们的流动就受制于调控货币本身流通的规律”（马克思，1887：83）。它必须确保流通中的货币“必须拥有自身的客观社会有效性”：“国家的强制行动只能在与社群领土同边界的内部流通领域内生效”（同上：84）。国家还是交易稳定性的保障者，因此是价值形式的保障者（卡利尼科斯，1987a：100）。国家作为最后贷款人的角色防止了货币秩序和银行系统的崩溃。 商品关系具有空间——层次——形式，这个事实对国家有影响。商品关系在多个空间尺度上发生。全球尺度对资本主义非常重要：“商品的生产、流通，以及更发展的流通形式”即所谓的全球性贸易或交易，“构成了资本主义崛起的历史基础”（马克思，1887：85）。顺便说一下，这种资本主义的全球性质意味着，无产阶级本质上具有全球性存在： 无产阶级......只能在世界历史上存在，正如共产主义，其活动，只能有一个‘世界历史’的存在。个体的世界历史性存在意味着个体的存在与世界历史直接相关。 （马克思和恩格斯，1845） 贸易的世界地理表明，资本主义从一开始就是一种全球现象。商品所有者在被各自国家管辖的多个政治分割的全球空间上相互进行交易，其中一些国家比其他国家更有权力。国家塑造商品交易不仅在国家层面上。它还塑造全球层面上的商品交易，包括基于征收关税的基础上。要想在另一个（遥远的）国家销售产品，需要额外的国家干预。强大商人的国家政府通过帮助商人，给予他们特许状和安全保障，促进了商业发展。18世纪，英国对来自南亚的商品在英国的销售实施了严格限制，以保护英国工业。得益于英国制造商对其政府的压力， 到1720年，已经通过了禁止穿着或使用印花或染色棉布的法律。1760年，一位女士因拥有一条进口手帕被罚款200英镑！此外，对原布的进口征收了重税。 （钱德拉，2009：92） 英国殖民地政府还强迫殖民地人民从事商品交易（例如，生产靛蓝），在那里原本不存在商品交易，并抵制任何保留基于大规模商品交易之外的生产和生计方式的努力。 确实，当强大的国家在全球层面上执行守护商品关系的任务（守护其他国家在其领土内守护商品规则）并在“较弱”国家强加商品关系和/或不平等商品交易时，这些强大的国家成为帝国主义国家（我将在第11章回到这个话题）。鉴于全球贸易的大幅扩张和货币的巨大流动，守护商品关系的需要变得更为重要，因此出台了促进“自由贸易”的法律（例如，针对国家干预经济的法律）。还有反洗钱的法律。 在资本主义中，几乎所有生产的东西都是商品（这是马克思的假设）或者受到商品化。但实际上，并非如此：并不是所有东西都是商品，有些东西只是部分地是商品，商品化过程不是线性的。重要的是要注意，物品的商品状态在一定程度上受到缺乏交换手段购买他们所需使用价值的普通民众的压力而受到争议，因此国家部分参与决定什么是商品，什么不是商品。当国家免费或以补贴价格提供使用价值（例如，疫苗）时，使用价值可能以非商品或半商品形式被享用。例如，儿童保育在这里是商品，在那里不是商品。正如玛莎·弗兰德利（Martha Friendly）（2019）指出的，儿童保育的商品状态在北美和澳大利亚比在北欧国家要广泛得多。这种地理上的不均衡在一定程度上反映了工资工人和小规模生产者对资本主义商品特性的争议程度，而不是认为理所当然，他们缺乏对交换价值的足够控制，因此如果他们必须为一切付费，将受到不利影响。 资本主义生产的主导目标不是直接满足人们的需求。“使用价值只有在资本家出于生产交换价值的目的时才被生产，因为使用价值是交换价值的物质基础，是交换价值的储存库”（马克思，1887：131）。资本家的目标是“生产具有交换价值的使用价值，即生产旨在出售的商品”。不仅如此。他们的目标是“生产一种商品，其价值大于生产过程中使用的商品价值总和”（同上），即为资本家带来利润的商品。因此，资本主义对使用价值的本质抽象。它不关心商品是有气味还是有味道。它甚至对商品是否对身体（如果它是致癌的）或对自然（水或空气中的毒性增加）有害都无所谓。无论哪种产品能更有利可图地销售，而不一定是人们为健康生活所需的东西，都将被生产和销售。这意味着，如果商品c1比商品c2更有利可图，但人们的需求通过c2得到更好的满足，则大规模商品生产者会诉诸于一个奇特的商品（即广告）来使人们相信他们实际上需要消费和购买c1。广告经常散布有关商品的错误信息，并创造不健康的需求（例如烟草）（威廉姆斯，1980）。这可能促使国家介入此类行为，但国家能做的有限（我将在下文中回到这一点）。 资本主义生产的动机是为了交换而不是满足人类需求的事实对国家有另一个含义：它对国家能为普通民众做些什么施加了限制。国家，宣称代表并且常常被许多人视为代表社会的总体利益，未能确保有足够的人们实际需要的东西（例如营养食品、住所、大流行期间的防护装备）。国家无法控制社会总劳动力被分配到生产不同东西的方式。结果，市场上可用的东西通常被假定具有某种用途。 2 价值关系和国家 一种商品有许多交换价值（例如，一台笔记本电脑可以换成100支笔或10件衬衫）。交换价值“只是表达方式，是某种其中包含但与之有别的现象形式”（马克思，1887：27）。价值是“在商品交换价值中表现出来的‘共同实质’”（同上：28）。说商品具有价值，首先是说，它们是人类劳动的产物，尽管是一种特定类型的人类劳动。给定的物品/服务“包含着同样非实体的实质”（同上），一定量的劳动力，无论它采用的具体形式是什么（例如，制造笔记本电脑或制造手杖的劳动），即抽象劳动，这是价值的本质。 一篇文章的价值量由“包含在该文章中的创造价值的劳动的数量”来衡量（第29页）。价值创造劳动的数量“通过其持续时间来衡量”（例如，劳动的周、日和小时）（同上）。这并不意味着“越是懒惰和无技巧的劳动者，其商品就越有价值，因为生产中所需的时间更多”（同上）。事实上，“社会必要的劳动时间是生产一篇文章所需的正常生产条件下以及当时普遍存在的技能和强度水平”（同上）在给定领土上（例如，一个国家的司法管辖区域）所需的时间。 决定在一个国家或跨国家中一种商品与许多其他商品交换的比例的是商品的社会价值（或简称价值）：在平均条件下进行的社会必要的抽象或均质劳动量。 定义价值的劳动是社会必要劳动。“一般来说，劳动的生产力越大，生产一篇文章所需的劳动时间越少，凝结在该文章中的劳动量越少，它的价值就越小”（马克思，1887：29-30）。因此，商品的价值（v）“与劳动的数量（q）成正比，与劳动的生产力（p）成反比”（同上：30）。这种生产力是工人和女工的平均技能量、科学和技术的状态以及生产和生产工具的社会组织的质量的函数（同上：29）。这种生产力也是物理/自然条件的函数。"},{"prompt":"请将“The state is potentially related to each of these circumstances, a fact Marx abstracts from. Anything that the state can do to reduce the costs of discovery of, for example, minerals (e.g. oil drilling) will affect their value. The state can change the state of development of science and technology via its investment in education and research. The state invests resources in transforming the physical/ natural environment as well (e.g. irrigating a dry area or increasing an area’s geographical accessibility). A commodity must be produced at its value, within a given geographical territory defined by the commodity circulation. It could be the area under the jurisdiction of the nation-state, and it could be the world market, which is where the law of value ultimately operates. If an enterprise spends x minutes to produce a laptop, while the average amount of time taken to produce a laptop is x/2 minutes, that enterprise runs the risk of going out of business, unless it is subsidized by the state bridging the gap between the individual and social value. By supporting capitalist commodity relations, the state supports some capitals better than other capitals. By investing in science and technology and through other measures, the state can create a situation where the value of commodities produced by capital under its territorial jurisdiction is reduced below the global average and where a country’s global competitiveness is thus enhanced. 3 The state, the ‘peculiar commodity’, and the labour circuit Commodities (e.g. corn, computer, genetically engineered seeds, Artificial Intelligence, education in private schools) are all products of human labour. In capitalism, the labour that produces commodities is itself a commodity (we are abstracting from the labour of a small-scale producer working on own account). ‘It is only from this moment that the produce of labour universally becomes a commodity’ (Marx, 1887: 124). In capitalist enterprises, wage-workers do not sell to the owner the products that they produce. They sell labour power. Labour power or the ‘capacity for labour’ is ‘the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being’, which they exercise whenever they produce a use-value (ibid.: 119). Labour power is a peculiar commodity unlike other animate and inanimate commodities. The state has to maintain this peculiarity, which has many aspects. So an important form of commodity exchange in capitalism is the one between the seller of labour power (worker) and the buyer of labour power (capitalist) who function ‘as free persons, as independent owners of commodities; the one possessing money and means of production, the other labourpower’ (Marx, 1887: 272). The sale and purchase of labour power requires a certain condition which has to be produced: double freedom of labour. The first aspect of this freedom is that people are economically forced to sell their labour power because they possess no means of production.11 This is a negative freedom which is discussed in the next chapter. The second aspect of the double freedom is that the person must be free from any obstacle to them, freely selling their labour power. This freedom, a positive freedom, exists only when the seller is the sole owner of the commodity, who does not sell himself/herself but only their ability to work for a certain number of hours every day and week. Unlike a slave labourer, the wage labourer ‘must constantly look upon his labour-power as his own property, his own commodity . . . by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily, for a definite period of time’ (Marx, 1887: 119). Capitalism is indeed characterized by the fact that ‘labour-power can appear upon the market as a commodity only if, and so far as its possessor . . . offers it for sale, or sells it, as a commodity’ (Marx, 1887: 119). For this to happen, they ‘must be the untrammelled owner of’ their capacity for labour, that is, of his or her person (ibid.; italics added). The owner of labour power and ‘the owner of money meet in the market’, and there is only one difference between them: ‘one is buyer, the other seller; both, therefore, equal in the eyes of the law\\" (ibid.; italics added). The state has to make sure that the labour power is a commodity and continues to remain so, that is, a person is not extra-economically forced to sell their labour power to a given buyer/employer and that a person must have the freedom to withdraw selling their labour power when they wish to. Labour freedom, labour’s commodity status, that the state generally seeks to protect, is beneficial to labour and to capital. It is better to work and live as a free labourer than an unfree/slave labourer. Because workers own their commodity labour power, they can sell it to whoever they want to and wherever they want to: if they receive lower wages from buyer b1 in one place than what the buyer b2 in another place offers, then they are free to sell it to b2. To the extent that the buyer, b1, pays lower-than-average wages and can benefit from the unfreedom and immobility of particular sellers of labour power, then he/she (b1) can have a competitive advantage over another buyer (b2). So the state makes sure that no such unfair advantage occurs in the labour market. Individual commodity owners need rules that govern commodity exchange but such rules and mechanisms of maintaining those rules constitute a use-value which cannot be bought and sold for a profit and which cannot therefore be supplied by capitalists because of their self-interested character. This applies to the peculiar commodity (labour power). The capitalist and the worker cannot maintain the labour power in its commodity status: they cannot ensure that the labourer is able to treat ‘his labour-power as his own property’ and he and the owner of money deal with each other ‘on the basis of equal rights’ (italics added) (Marx, 1887: 119). Only the state, characterized by a semblance of the separation from the private interests of workers and capitalists, can do so in the interests of the ‘community’ of workers and capitalists. ‘Wherever free labour is the rule, the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract’ (Marx, 1887: 123). The fact of a free labourer is codified in state laws: ‘[O]nly the independent labourer, and therefore only the labourer legally qualified to act for himself, enters as a vendor of a commodity into a contract with the capitalist’ (italics added) (ibid.: 194). There is a sense in which different types of labour are the same: leather work, scavenging, computer-typing are all equal in that they represent the expenditure of a certain amount of mental and manual energy.12 This fact contributes to the notion of equality in society which is then reflected in state’s laws about equality: all the people are equal before law. So not only does the state maintain the commodity status of the products of labour and of labour power, but also does it maintain the equal status of people involved in different kinds of labour. Like any other commodity, labour power has value. Value of labour power is the average value of the necessary commodified means of subsistence which people need to live. The value of this commodity has some peculiarity, with implications for the state. The value of labour power includes the cost of satisfying different needs (a definite quantity of muscle, brain, and the like is expended, which has to be replaced; shelter, healthcare, education, and so on) and the cost of replacing the people who die. (Wage is the monetary form of this value.) The state plays a role in meeting some of the needs and in regulating how these needs are met. Needs are shaped by the physical environment, which is in turn changed partly by state action (e.g. policies concerning the environment). Habits and expectations and the level of civilization also shape human needs, adding a cultural element to human need. Here also the state plays a role as it partly serves as a repository of human history and memories and subjected to pressure from workers (to expand their needs). If the state is involved in the determination of the value of labour power, it is then involved in production of labour power itself. Some of the state-aided technical change can reduce the value of labour power by shortening the time taken to produce the means of subsistence or to produce the means of production that produce the wage goods. It can affect the cost of the maintenance of labour through policies of taxation of subsistence of items and through its import policies where cheap articles produced abroad enter a national market thus lowering the cost of reproduction. By contributing to the value of labour power in non-commodified forms (e.g. state-funded schools), the state can also lower the value of the bundle of necessaries (i.e. wages that private capital pays), other things constant. A general point to be made here is that the state, to enforce equal exchange involving the sale of labour power and indeed sale of all other commodities, has to be involved in an activity which is not based on equal exchange: for example, the tax that the state receives is a tribute. The commodity relations are characterized by the principle of not only freedom but also equality: commodity owners ‘exchange equivalent for equivalent’. This general principle applies to buyers and sellers of labour power. Not only should sellers of labour power be free to sell their commodity (and that the state seeks to make sure that this happens) but also the price of their commodity, labour power (i.e. wage), should be equal to the cost of its production. Marx generally assumes in Capital vol. 1 that this is the case, but he is also aware that in the real world, this is not.13 Millions of people receive a wage that is below the cost of production of their labour power, including the cost of food and shelter, education for children, and so on. This is indicated partly by the population below the ‘poverty line’ in every country of the world.14 This happens even in advanced countries such as the US.15”翻译为中文","completion":"将分析从个体提升到社会层面，可以看到，力量必须成为维护商品关系的一般条件。\\"在商品生产中，‘需求’与‘权利’处于对立面\\"，在这个意义上说，“现存的财产关系”，这些尚未成为生产关系，“每天持续地系统地将生产者与他们的需求对象分离”。因而，社会被组织成这样一种方式，它“不断地驱使个体、团体、阶级和其他集体”侵犯“他人的权利”。换句话说，“越过、偷窃、侵略、压迫、抢夺和普遍违反财产权的动机，通过物质需求的压力不断被重新创造”（米维尔，2005：127）。 因此，这种社会生产关系体系产生了对'防御'手段的永久和普遍要求，即对暴力手段及其组织的需求。如果没有持续的威胁和/或使用暴力，商品生产将面临迅速颠覆和瓦解的危险。 （同上） 商品交换需要交换媒介，因此国家“流通印有各种面额的纸币”（马克思，1887：83）。\\"资本无非是......为了赚取更多金钱而重新投入生产和流通中的金钱。如果货币要代表真实价值，就需要对货币供应和信贷进行同样的国家调控\\"（哈维，2012：274）。尽管有必要，国家甚至可能从流通中撤回某些货币（去货币化）。这样的政策对普通民众可能产生巨大影响。国家必须确保，只要货币“代替了同等数量的黄金，它们的流动就受制于调控货币本身流通的规律”（马克思，1887：83）。它必须确保流通中的货币“必须拥有自身的客观社会有效性”：“国家的强制行为只能在与社区领土同边界的流通内部领域内生效”（同上：84）。国家还是交易稳定性及价值形式的保障者（卡利尼科斯，1987a：100）。国家作为最后贷款人的角色，防止了货币秩序和银行系统的崩溃。 商品关系具有空间——层次——形式，这个事实对国家有所影响。商品关系在多个空间尺度上发生。全球尺度对资本主义非常重要：“商品的生产、流通，以及更发达的流通形式”即所谓的全球性交易或贸易，“构成了资本主义崛起的历史基础”（马克思，1887：85）。顺便说一下，这种资本主义的全球性质意味着，无产阶级本质上具有全球性存在： 无产阶级......只能在世界历史上存在，正如共产主义，它的活动，只能有一个'世界历史'的存在。个体的世界历史性存在意味着个体的存在与世界历史直接相关。 （马克思和恩格斯，1845） 贸易的全球地理表明，资本主义从一开始就是一种全球现象。商品所有者在被各自国家管辖的多个政治分割的全球空间上相互进行交易，其中一些国家比其他国家更有权力。国家塑造商品交易不仅在国家层面上。它还在全球层面上塑造商品交易，包括基于征收关税的基础上。为了在另一个（远方的）国家销售产品，需要额外的国家干预。强大商人的国家政府通过帮助商人，给予他们特许状和安全保障，促进了商业发展。18世纪，英国对来自南亚的商品在英国的销售实施了严格限制，以保护英国工业。得益于英国制造商对其政府的压力， 到1720年，已经通过了禁止穿着或使用印花或染色棉布的法律。1760年，一位女士因拥有一条进口手帕被罚款200英镑！此外，对原布的进口征收了重税。 （钱德拉，2009：92） 英国殖民地政府还强迫殖民地人民从事商品交易（例如，生产靛蓝），在那里原本不存在商品交易，并抵制任何保留基于大规模商品交易之外的生产和生计方式的努力。 确实，当强大的国家在全球层面上执行守护商品关系的任务（守护其他国家在其领土内守护商品规则）并在“较弱”国家强加商品关系和/或不平等商品交易时，这些强大的国家成为帝国主义国家（我将在第11章回到这个话题）。鉴于全球贸易的大幅扩张和货币的巨大流动，守护商品关系的需要变得更为重要，因此出台了促进“自由贸易”的法律（例如，针对国家干预经济的法律）。还有反洗钱的法律。 在资本主义中，几乎所有生产的东西都是商品（这是马克思的假设）或者受到商品化。但实际上，并非如此：并不是所有东西都是商品，有些东西只是部分地是商品，商品化过程不是线性的。重要的是要注意，物品的商品状态在一定程度上受到缺乏交换手段购买他们所需使用价值的普通民众的压力而受到争议，因此国家部分参与决定什么是商品，什么不是商品。当国家免费或以补贴价格提供使用价值（例如，疫苗）时，使用价值可能以非商品或半商品形式被享用。像儿童保育这样的使用价值在这里可能是商品，在那里则可能不是。正如玛莎·弗兰德利（Martha Friendly）（2019）指出的，儿童保育的商品状态在北美和澳大利亚比在北欧国家要广泛得多。这种地理上的不均衡在一定程度上反映了工资工人和小规模生产者对资本主义商品特性的争议程度，而不是认为理所当然，他们缺乏对交换价值的足够控制，因此如果他们必须为一切付费，将受到不利影响。 资本主义生产的主导目标不是直接满足人们的需求。“使用价值只有在资本家出于生产交换价值的目的时才被生产，因为使用价值是交换价值的物质基础，是交换价值的储存库”（马克思，1887：131）。资本家的目标是“生产具有交换价值的使用价值，即生产旨在出售的商品”。不仅如此。他们的目标是“生产一种商品，其价值大于生产过程中使用的商品价值总和”（同上），即为资本家带来利润的商品。因此，资本主义对使用价值的本质抽象。它不关心商品是有气味还是有味道。它甚至对商品是否对身体（如果它是致癌的）或对自然（水或空气中的毒性增加）有害都无所谓。无论哪种产品能更有利可图地销售，而不一定是人们为健康生活所需的东西，都将被生产和销售。这意味着，如果商品c1比商品c2更有利可图，但人们的需求通过c2得到更好的满足，则大规模商品生产者会诉诸于一个奇特的商品（即广告）来使人们相信他们实际上需要消费和购买c1。广告经常散布错误信息，并创造不健康的需求（例如烟草）（威廉姆斯，1980）。这可能促使国家介入此类行为，但国家能做的有限（我将在下文中回到这一点）。 资本主义生产的动机是为了交换而不是满足人类需求的事实对国家有另一个含义：它对国家能为普通民众做些什么施加了限制。国家，宣称代表并且常常被许多人视为代表社会的总体利益，未能确保有足够的人们实际需要的东西（例如营养食品、住所、大流行期间的防护装备）。国家无法控制社会总劳动力被分配到生产不同东西的方式。结果，市场上可用的东西通常被假定具有某种用途。"},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

Within this chaotic milieu emerged a scenario few could have predicted, casting a long shadow over the aspirations of revolutionaries and reformers alike. The unexpected demise of both Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat Sen, pivotal figures in China's struggle for a modern identity, opened a political vacuum that beckoned for resolution amidst the turmoil of the National Protection War. With Yuan Shikai's passing, the fleeting experiment of the Empire of China found itself on precarious grounds. Yuan Keding, known by his era and regal name of Yuntai, stood as the reluctant heir to a throne clouded by controversy and opposition. His refusal to ascend as the Emperor marked a period of extended regency that mirrored the nation's search for stability and direction. Simultaneously, the southern provinces, led by an impassioned Guangdong and Guangxi, declared their autonomy, creating a de facto Cantonese Republic that echoed the decentralized facets of China's storied past. The schism that had grown between the aspirations of the Republican reformists and the imperial designs of Yuan's dominion saw an unexpected bridge in the resurgence of a dynasty long thought relegated to the annals of history. The Great Ming, with its centuries-old legacy preceding the Qing's dominance, was poised for an unimaginable return. It was the National Assembly, a body itself grappling with the identity of the nascent republic, that proposed a solution both radical and steeped in historical symbolism. Inviting the surviving descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu to reclaim their ancestral throne was a move fraught with uncertainty. Yet, the National Assembly discerned in this strategy a means to galvanize support among the populace, leveraging the deep-seated reverence for the Ming to foster a sense of unity and purpose. The Zhu heirs, ensconced in obscurity and bearing the weight of their lineage's fall, emerged as reluctant symbols of potential reconciliation and renewal. This decision did not come lightly, nor was it universally acclaimed. Skeptics saw in it a regression to monarchical rule, an anathema to the republican ideals touted by the revolutionaries of the Xinhai movement. Nevertheless, the proposition of a restored Ming monarchy was predicated on a new covenant with the people – a constitutional framework that would circumscribe the powers of the throne, ensuring that the specters of absolutism would not haunt the path forward. The ascension of the Zhu descendants in 1917 marked an epochal shift, not merely in governance but in the ideological contours that had defined China's tumultuous entry into the 20th century. The Great Ming Restoration, as it came to be known, was an endeavor that sought to meld the venerable with the modern, imbuing the ancient dynasty with the principles of constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. Under this rejuvenated Ming, China embarked on reforms that were as ambitious as they were fraught with challenges. The imperial court, now presided over by a monarch whose authority was both historical and constitutionally delimited, worked in concert with the National Assembly to navigate the complexities of regional autonomy, modernization, and national integration. The Cantonese Republic, for its part, maintained a delicate relationship with the central authority, embodying the persistent undercurrents of regionalism that had long characterized China's vast expanse. Yet, in the overarching narrative of the Ming's restoration, there was a sense of cautious optimism, a belief that the phoenix of the Ming could indeed rise from the ashes of the old, heralding a new chapter in the annals of China's storied history. In the years that followed, the Ming Dynasty, reborn and reimagined, would face the Herculean task of uniting a nation fractured by war, ideology, and regional loyalties. The path was fraught with challenges and setbacks, but the collective endeavor to forge a modern state from the crucible of China's rich and turbulent history remained an unwavering quest. This chapter of rebirth and resilience, of an unlikely phoenix rising, would forever alter the course of China and its place in the world."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Picture a vibrant cucumber field under a bright, clear sky, where the green of the plants is vivid and spreads out in all directions as far as the eye can see. Cucumbers, swollen with water, are hanging from the vines, lush and plentiful. In the middle of this verdant field, there's a makeshift chair, ingeniously crafted from cucumbers. This isn't a chair in the conventional sense, as cucumbers, being soft and not structurally sound, couldn't support a person's weight in reality. However, for the sake of creativity, imagine that these cucumbers have been magically or metaphorically strengthened, interwoven, or structured in a way to form a stable seat and backrest, embodying the essence of the cucumber field itself. Sitting on this cucumber chair is an African boy named Jesus. His presence is serene, embodying a sense of peace and connection with nature. He's dressed simply, perhaps in light clothing that flutters slightly with a gentle breeze, blending with the natural surroundings. His eyes might reflect a wisdom or understanding far beyond his years, a nod to the significant name he bears. Around him, the air is filled with the fresh, crisp scent of cucumbers, and perhaps you can hear the soft rustle of leaves as the gentle wind moves through the field. This scene, merging the pastoral with the fantastical, underscores a narrative of harmony with nature, creativity, and the inherent playfulness and imagination within us all. Visualizing such a scene challenges the boundaries between the possible and the fantastical, inviting viewers or readers to suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in a world where nature and magic intertwine seamlessly."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems your message may not have come through as intended.

Here's how Vincent could significantly impact the narrative and character development: **Mentorship and Support**: - Vincent's understanding of Elliot's domestic struggles due to his own similar experiences provides a foundation for a strong, empathetic bond between them. This mentorship could be crucial in helping Elliot navigate his challenges, with Vincent offering guidance both implicitly through his actions and explicitly through advice, grounded in his own past and how he overcame it. **Cultural Richness and Diversity**: - Vincent's Italian-American heritage and his connection to his family's history through the pizzeria introduce a rich cultural tapestry to the narrative.

This diversity can be showcased through various storylines, including cultural festivals, collaborative events between the restaurants, or simply through the daily interactions that enrich the characters' lives. **Veteran Experience**: - Having served as a tank driver during the Gulf War, Vincent brings a layer of complexity to his character. This aspect of his background can be explored in various ways, from how it influences his business ethics and leadership style to how it affects his personal life and relationships. Additionally, his military service could connect with themes of camaraderie, sacrifice, and the search for purpose after life-altering experiences. **Romantic Subplots and Personal Growth**: - Known as \\"Dr. Love\\", Vincent's romantic endeavors and his plans to get married could provide lighter, more humorous subplots that contrast with the more serious themes of the manga.

It's white, rusty and it sometimes sounds like there's a rodent in the engine. However when he's at work, he is sometimes allowed to use his boss's car to deliver pizzas and his boss's car is a green 1970s station wagon that is similar to the one Elliot's father drove. Around 70% in the story he gets himself a new car, a modern-day, somewhat dusty, used, 2001 Volvo station wagon.","completion":"Elliot's progression through different vehicles over the course of your manga serves as a fascinating metaphor for his own journey and development as a character. Each car not only supports the plot but also enriches the symbolic landscape of the story, mirroring Elliot's growth, struggles, and the evolution of his relationships. **1980s Volkswagen Golf**: - The old, rusty Volkswagen Golf, with its peculiar rodent-like engine noises, could symbolize Elliot's humble beginnings and the struggles he faces both personally and financially. Its condition reflects the rough patches in his life, including his relationship with his father and his mental health issues. Despite its flaws, the car is a symbol of Elliot's independence and resilience, a sanctuary of sorts where he can escape the challenges of his daily life. **Boss's 1970s Station Wagon**: - Being allowed to use his boss Vincent's car for deliveries represents the trust and mentorship forming between them. It's a gesture of Vincent's support, recognizing Elliot's reliability and hard work. However, the fact that the station wagon is similar to the one driven by Elliot's father introduces a complex layer of emotions. This parallel could evoke memories and feelings related to his troubled family life, creating moments of internal conflict or reflection for Elliot. It can also signify the healing process, as positive experiences with the wagon at work partially overwrite negative associations with his past. **2001 Volvo Station Wagon**: - The acquisition of a somewhat newer, albeit used, Volvo station wagon around 70% into the story marks a significant turning point for Elliot. It's a tangible sign of progress, symbolizing a move toward stability and perhaps a more optimistic view of his future. Though still not brand new or high-end, the Volvo represents Elliot's personal growth, his efforts to move beyond his past, and his aspirations for a better life. The choice of a station wagon, echoing his boss's car and indirectly his father's, may also reflect a reconciliation with his past or a reclaiming of his narrative, turning a previously negative association into something positive and self-affirmed. **Symbolism and Themes**: - Through these vehicles, the manga weaves themes of growth, healing, and the journey toward self-sufficiency. Each car represents different stages in Elliot's life, his changing circumstances, and evolving outlook. The cars are not just modes of transportation but vessels carrying the weight of past experiences, present challenges, and future hopes. **Plot Development**: - These transitions can also be used as plot devices to catalyze or signify important developments in the story. For instance, the moment Elliot acquires the Volvo could coincide with a pivotal personal achievement or a moment of profound emotional growth. It could also introduce new challenges or adventures, perhaps related to his job, relationships, or an aspect of his dark past he's yet to confront. Elliot's narrative, punctuated by these vehicular milestones, offers a relatable and visually engaging way to explore themes of resilience, redemption, and transformation. The reader gets to journey with Elliot not just emotionally and psychologically, but through the very real and tangible symbol of the cars he drives, each with its own story and significance in his life."},{"prompt":"His dream car is a 1967 Camaro. Problem is... it's stripped down to the chassis. The only thing left is the doors, engine and suspension. The chassis and the rest have been rotting away in his parental home's garage down in Saratoga Springs. The house has been for sale since he left his home and he doesn't know that Camaro even exists.","completion":"Elliot's dream of owning a 1967 Camaro, only to discover it in a stripped-down state, introduces a compelling narrative thread with rich thematic and symbolic potential. This plot element can serve multiple functions within your story, mirroring Elliot's personal journey, his relationship with his past, and his aspirations for the future. **Discovery and Revelation**: - The moment Elliot learns about the Camaro's existence could serve as a crucial turning point in the narrative. The revelation might come at a time when Elliot is seeking a connection to his past or contemplating his future, making the discovery deeply symbolic. This could act as a catalyst for Elliot to confront unresolved issues with his family, especially if the car was hidden or forgotten, underscoring themes of neglect or lost potential both in his personal life and the car itself. **Symbol of Dreams and Aspirations**: - The 1967 Camaro, a classic and coveted vehicle, symbolizes Elliot's dreams and the life he wishes to lead—one that is vastly different from his current circumstances. The fact that the car is stripped down to its chassis, with key parts still intact but the whole in disrepair, could mirror Elliot's own state: the core of who he is and his potential are intact, but he's been worn down by his experiences and surroundings. **Path to Restoration**: - Restoring the Camaro could become a central plot device, paralleling Elliot’s own path to healing and self-improvement. The physical act of rebuilding the car—sourcing parts, learning new skills, dedicating time and resources—could reflect Elliot's efforts to rebuild his own life, mend relationships, and work towards his dreams. This restoration journey could bring new characters into Elliot’s life, challenge him in unexpected ways, and ultimately serve as a metaphor for personal growth. **Connection to Family Legacy**: - The Camaro, sitting in the family home's garage, ties Elliot directly to his familial heritage and perhaps to memories or aspects of his family life before it frayed. The car could serve as a bridge between the past and the future, offering narrative opportunities to explore family dynamics, forgiveness, and the possibility of reconciliation. Elliot's relationship with the car might parallel his feelings toward his family—abandoned and left to decay, but not beyond saving. **Achievement of a Dream**: - The climax of the Camaro's restoration could coincide with a key moment in Elliot’s personal development, symbolizing the achievement of his dreams against all odds. Driving the restored Camaro could be depicted as a triumphant moment, marking Elliot's journey from a troubled past to a hopeful, self-assured future. Integrating the Camaro into your narrative offers a potent symbol for transformation, ambition, and the complex interplay between past and future. Its restoration might not only fulfill a personal dream for Elliot but also provide a tangible representation of his psychological and emotional growth throughout the manga."},{"prompt":"His apartment in New York looks very basic.

This game, known for its thrilling car chases and rebellious spirit, resonates with Elliot's own desire to break free from the constraints of his past and perhaps from the complexities of his current life. **Extravagant Dark Blue Suit**: - The presence of a dark blue suit, carefully preserved and hidden away, reveals a side of Elliot that aspires to moments of significance or formality. It's a symbol of his hope for occasions that warrant such attire, suggesting a desire for upward mobility or the anticipation of events that break from the everyday monotony. This could also point towards an internal conflict between his day-to-day existence and dreams of a different, perhaps more refined or successful life. **Computer Setup**: - The detailed description of his computer setup, including the Windows XP background and a plethora of games, reinforces Elliot's connection to the digital world. It's a space of comfort and escape, a hub for both entertainment and perhaps a connection to communities that share his interests.

The practical appliances, like a microwave and blender, indicate a no-frills approach to living—function over form. The calendar of scantily clad women might point towards a conventional or perhaps adolescent expression of masculinity, but can also be seen as a contrast to the more personal and meaningful decorations in his living space, suggesting layers to Elliot's character that go beyond initial impressions. Collectively, these details of Elliot's apartment paint a picture of a young man navigating the complexities of adulthood, tethered to his passions and aspirations, while also revealing the contrasts and conflicts within his personality.

Through this encounter, the ongoing impact of his father's denial on Elliot's psyche and the dynamic between them can be further explored, laying bare the challenges of reconciling with a painful past. Here's how you could approach this scene: **Setting and Atmosphere**: - The choice of a fancy restaurant contrasts sharply with the tension between Elliot and his father. This setting, typically associated with celebration or special occasions, becomes a backdrop to a confrontation that is both personal and painful. The stark difference between the surface-level elegance of their surroundings and the underlying discord can heighten the emotional impact of the scene. **Character Interaction**: - Elliot's father's denial and refusal to acknowledge the abuse he inflicted adds layers to his character, potentially revealing his own mechanisms of coping or escaping from guilt. Meanwhile, Elliot's growing desperation to leave the situation reflects his inability to bridge the gap between his desire for acknowledgment and the reality of his father's indifference or denial. **Elliot’s Internal Monologue**: - Giving insight into Elliot's thoughts during the dinner can provide depth to the scene, allowing readers to understand the turmoil he feels—caught between the hope for a different outcome and the reality of his father's unchanged behavior. This moment of reflection could also serve as an opportunity for Elliot to acknowledge his own growth and reaffirm his resolve to move beyond his father's shadow. **The Aftermath**: - The emotional aftermath of this dinner could be a turning point for Elliot, prompting a reevaluation of his expectations and his relationship with his father. It might lead him to seek solace in his passions, friends, or even his work, showing how he copes with disappointment and channels his feelings into something constructive or healing. **Symbolism**: - You might use elements of the dinner—such as the food ordered, the restaurant's ambiance, or even the background music—as symbols reflecting Elliot's emotional state or the nature of his relationship with his father. For instance, an untouched plate could symbolize Elliot's inability to digest his father's words, or a broken glass could mirror the fractured nature of their relationship. **Dialogue**: - The conversation between Elliot and his father could be crafted to oscillate between superficial topics and deeper, more contentious issues, highlighting the chasm in their understanding and empathy. The denial from his father can be met with Elliot's silence, unanswered questions, or even a direct confrontation, each response revealing more about Elliot's character and how he has learned to handle interactions with his father. The scene holds significant potential for character development and thematic exploration. It’s an opportunity to delve into the complexities of family dynamics, the long-term effects of abuse, and the pursuit of personal healing and acceptance. By handling this encounter with sensitivity and depth, you can underscore Elliot's resilience and the ongoing process of his emotional and psychological growth."},{"prompt":"Anyway when his father keeps making fun of Elliot for his bad grades back in high school, not paying attention and his job as a pizza delivery boy, Elliot quickly goes into the men's bathroom and has a panic attack there. His plan is to sit there until the restaurant closes however someone comes to his rescue. A waiter recognises Elliot and they chat for a few minutes.","completion":"This scene, where Elliot retreats to the men's bathroom to escape the demeaning comments from his father and subsequently experiences a panic attack, is a critical moment that highlights the gravity of his mental health struggles and the impact of his father's abuse. The inclusion of a waiter—who recognizes Elliot and offers a moment of reprieve through their chat—serves as a beacon of empathy and understanding in Elliot's otherwise turbulent life. Here’s how you might further develop this pivotal scene: **Elliot's Vulnerability**: - The panic attack in the bathroom encapsulates Elliot's vulnerability and the deep scars left by his father's negative treatment. This moment of raw emotional exposure offers readers insight into the intensity of Elliot's feelings and the coping mechanisms he's forced to adopt in difficult situations, making his character more relatable and human. **The Waiter's Role**: - The waiter's intervention is symbolic of unexpected kindness and the impact of small gestures of support. This character doesn't have to know the specifics of Elliot's situation to recognize someone in distress and offer comfort, embodying the idea that empathy and understanding can come from unlikely sources. The waiter's decision to check on Elliot can also serve as a gentle reminder of the importance of community and human connection. **Development of the Scene**: - The conversation between Elliot and the waiter could begin with simple, surface-level topics—an attempt by the waiter to gauge Elliot's state and offer a distraction—before gradually delving into more personal territory as trust is established, even if only implicitly. It's important that this interaction doesn't solve Elliot's deeper issues; rather, it provides a temporary respite that underscores the significance of empathy and listening. **Elliot's Reaction and Reflection**: - Following this encounter, Elliot might reflect on the interaction, considering the contrast between the waiter's kindness and his father's harshness. This moment could spark a realization about the variety of human connections and support systems available outside of family ties, encouraging Elliot to seek out and cherish more positive relationships in his life. **Symbolism and Thematic Elements**: - This scene is ripe with symbolism and can be used to explore themes of isolation, the societal stigma surrounding mental health, and the redemptive power of kindness. The bathroom, a confined and private space, symbolizes Elliot's isolation and desire to hide his vulnerabilities, while the waiter's intervention represents the lifeline of human connection in moments of acute distress. **Moving Forward**: - The aftermath of this scene should see Elliot in a reflective state, possibly with a renewed perspective on his situation or with the realization that he possesses more inner strength and external support than he previously acknowledged. It could also catalyze a turning point in the narrative, prompting him to seek help, open up to friends, or confront his father about their relationship. In fleshing out this scene, focusing on the emotional authenticity of Elliot's panic attack and the genuine kindness of the waiter will be key to delivering a powerful message. This moment not only highlights Elliot's struggles but also illuminates a pathway toward healing, emphasizing that even in our darkest moments, compassion can shine through and make a difference."},{"prompt":"That waiter is a old friend of Elliot named Ryan. They were friends since kindergarten. He has short spiky brown hair and green eyes. He is known to be quite seductive and rebellious and is sometimes known by some of his co-workers as \\"Dr. Love\\" he was also really good at hockey in high school and loves to play the guitar.","completion":"The revelation that the waiter, Ryan, is an old friend of Elliot from kindergarten infuses the scene with even greater depth and resonance. This twist not just surprises the reader but also adds layers to Elliot’s experience in the restaurant, transforming what could have been a brief encounter with a stranger into a meaningful interaction with a significant figure from his past. Here’s how Ryan’s background and his reunion with Elliot could be fleshed out to enrich the narrative: **Reunion and Recognition:** - When Ryan approaches Elliot in his moment of vulnerability, it's not just as a concerned waiter but as a friend who has a history with him, possibly understanding Elliot’s distress on a level that a stranger couldn't. The recognition might not be immediate, especially if Elliot is in a state of panic, but once it occurs, it anchors him back to a sense of familiarity and safety. **Character Dynamics:** - Ryan's attributes—his seductive and rebellious nature, combined with his nickname \\"Dr. Love\\" and talents in hockey and guitar—paint a picture of a charismatic and multi-talented individual who likely had a significant influence on Elliot during their younger years. His dynamic presence and perhaps more outwardly confident approach to life contrast with Elliot's current vulnerabilities, offering a stark reminder of their shared past and how their paths have diverged. **The Conversation:** - Their chat in the bathroom can initially revolve around catching up, reminiscing about their days in kindergarten, and recounting shared memories that might offer Elliot a temporary escape from his troubles. Ryan's charm and wit could momentarily distract Elliot, drawing him out of his panic state. Yet, as the conversation deepens, Ryan might pick up on Elliot's distress and offer not just comfort but also insights or advice rooted in their long-standing friendship. **Impact on Elliot:** - This encounter with Ryan might serve as a turning point for Elliot, reminding him of his own worth and the support system he still has. Ryan, embodying qualities of self-assurance and resilience, can inspire Elliot to confront his issues more openly or to seek help, reinforcing the theme that friendship and understanding can be potent antidotes to personal turmoil. **Ryan’s Role Moving Forward:** - Reintroducing Ryan into Elliot’s life opens up numerous narrative possibilities. As someone who knew Elliot before his struggles intensified, Ryan has the potential to play a supportive role moving forward, perhaps encouraging Elliot to reconnect with other positive aspects of his past or explore new avenues for growth and recovery. Their renewed friendship could also expose Elliot to hobbies or social circles he's distanced himself from, like music or sports, offering him new outlets for self-expression and healing. **Shared Interests and Future Interactions:** - Given Ryan’s love for guitar and Elliot’s fondness for video games and possibly music, their interactions might also revolve around these shared interests. Whether it’s Ryan inviting Elliot to see him play at a local venue or the two reminiscing over video games they used to play together, these moments can serve as building blocks for rebuilding Elliot’s sense of community and belonging. This rekindled friendship with Ryan not only offers immediate comfort to Elliot but also signifies the enduring nature of true connections, emphasizing how they can resurface and provide solace during life's lowest points. Through Ryan, the narrative can explore themes of resilience, the power of friendship, and the importance of reaching out, further enriching Elliot’s journey towards recovery and self-acceptance."},{"prompt":"Ryan has a plan. A musician is scheduled to play the piano in the restaurant however he can't arrive because he has to attend... court as a defendant... Since Elliot knows a bit of piano, he'll get paid a dollar a minute to play the piano. He plays Moonlight Sonata at the speed of a mile per hour. His dad grumpily watches muttering \\"He could have become a welder...\\" eventually when he finishes the song, some people clap, some keep eating and some keep drinking. He played for 50 minutes so he got paid 50 bucks.","completion":"The setup you've described here, with Ryan orchestrating an opportunity for Elliot to play the piano at the restaurant, is a clever narrative move that serves multiple purposes. It not only showcases Ryan's resourcefulness and desire to help Elliot but also shines a light on Elliot's hidden talents, juxtaposed poignantly against his father's continued lack of understanding and appreciation for who Elliot is. Here's how this scenario could further enrich the narrative: **Spotlight on Elliot's Talent**: - Elliot playing Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" beautifully at \\"the speed of a mile an hour\\" creates a moment of raw emotional exposure, not just for Elliot but for the audience within and outside the story. It serves as a metaphor for Elliot's journey—moving through life and its challenges with a quiet, enduring resilience. This scene emphasizes that Elliot's value doesn't hinge on the practical or traditionally masculine career his father envisions for him like welding but exists in his unique abilities and passions. **Contrast in Perception**: - The varied reactions from the restaurant's patrons—some applauding, others indifferent—mirror the broader societal reception to individual talents and pursuits. It subtly comments on the reality that not everyone will recognize or value one's talents equally, a life lesson that Elliot is experiencing firsthand, especially with his father's response. **Elliot’s Father’s Reaction**: - The father's grumbling observation that \\"He could have become a welder...\\" succinctly encapsulates his inability or refusal to understand Elliot's true nature and aspirations. It highlights the generational gap and differing value systems between Elliot and his father, underscoring the emotional and psychological chasm that has developed between them. **A Moment of Triumph and Independence**: - Despite his father's disparagement, Elliot's performance and the compensation he receives for it—50 for 50 minutes—symbolize a moment of triumph and independence. It's a direct contradiction to his father's narrative, proving that Elliot can carve out a path for himself based on his interests and skills. This moment could bolster Elliot's self-esteem and validate his pursuit of personal passions over externally imposed expectations. **Potential for Story Development**: - This scenario can open up various avenues for character and plot development. Elliot's unexpected performance might catch the eye of someone influential in the music or entertainment industry, leading to new opportunities. Alternatively, it could serve as a turning point in Elliot's relationship with his father, forcing a confrontation or a reassessment of their relationship. It could also strengthen the bond between Elliot and Ryan, establishing a foundation for further adventures or collaborative ventures. **Symbolism and Thematic Exploration**: - The choice of \\"Moonlight Sonata,\\" a piece often associated with tranquility, introspection, and depth of emotion, can be symbolic of Elliot's internal state and the complexity of his journey. The performance is a form of silent protest against his father's expectations, a declaration of his identity, and a demonstration of his resolve to find his own way despite the obstacles. Incorporating this piano performance into the story effectively uses Elliot's talent as a narrative and thematic tool, offering a poignant commentary on the importance of recognizing and celebrating individuality, resilience against familial pressure, and the pursuit of one’s passions as a legitimate path to fulfillment and success."},{"prompt":"His dad is in New York for a week. When he has to get home, Elliot decides to drive him to the airport. His plan? Make sure he has fun while being driven to the airport. How does this plan go? Since his Golf has a tape player, he decides to put Black Sabbath's Paranoid at full volume and basically drive him to the airport while driving like in a GTA game and near 80% towards the end of this drive, his car starts having that familiar rodent sound in the engine. His engine stalls the second he pulls the handbrake at the JFK airport. His dad finally apologizes... for that one time he yelled at him for not folding a towel properly and gets out of his son's Golf.","completion":"Elliot's plan to give his dad a memorable drive to the airport encapsulates a mix of rebellion, a quest for approval, and a longing for a more positive connection with his father. The usage of Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" blaring through the tape player of his Volkswagen Golf, combined with a driving style reminiscent of a Grand Theft Auto game, is both a humorous nod to his personal interests and a small act of defiance against his father's conservative outlook. **The Drive**: - The drive to the airport can be seen as a microcosm of Elliot's relationship with his father—chaotic, filled with highs and lows, and ultimately, an attempt to bridge the gap between them, even if through unconventional means. Elliot's choice to crank up \\"Paranoid\\" and the risky driving style could be his way of trying to connect with his dad on his terms, showing him a side of life that's far removed from the criticisms and expectations that have plagued their interactions. **The Tape Player and Music Choice**: - Music often serves as a vehicle for expressing identity and rebellion, and \\"Paranoid\\" by Black Sabbath, a band synonymous with the heavy metal genre that often deals with themes of social alienation, mental anguish, and defiance, is a perfect anthem for Elliot's act of rebellion. It's not just background music; it's a statement about Elliot's own feelings of being misunderstood and sidelined by his father. **Father's Reaction**: - The father's experience during the drive, especially if he's not accustomed to such a high-octane venture, could range from shock to begrudging admiration for Elliot's boldness. This rollercoaster ride might not lead to a profound, heartfelt apology for all the wrongs or acknowledgment of Elliot's struggles, but it does force him out of his comfort zone, offering a new perspective on his son's world. **The Car's Breakdown**: - The Volkswagen Golf stalling and making the \\"familiar rodent sound\\" just as they reach JFK Airport adds a layer of comical yet poignant symbolism to their journey. Despite Elliot's efforts, the car—their relationship—ultimately falters under the strain, perhaps suggesting that their bond, much like the Golf, needs attention and care to run smoothly. **The Apology**: - The father's apology, although woefully inadequate and specific to a seemingly trivial incident of not folding a towel properly, is indicative of his inability to grasp the depth of his shortcomings as a parent or to understand Elliot's true grievances. It's a small, almost laughable step, showing at least some willingness to admit fault, even if he's missing the bigger picture. **Conclusion**: - This experience might not magically mend their fractured relationship, but it's laden with symbolism and potential growth for both characters. For Elliot, the drive is a declaration of his individuality and an attempt to force his father to see him—truly see him—for the first time. For his father, it's a bewildering journey that slightly cracks open the door to acknowledging past wrongs, even if he's not fully ready to walk through it. The culmination of this sequence invites readers to reflect on the complexities of father-son relationships, the longing for approval versus the desire to be true to oneself, and the realization that healing and understanding are often iterative, messy processes."},{"prompt":"He ends up taking a tow truck home and his car is at the car service until his engine is fixed. He goes home and celebrates with a can of beer and a movie from the Dirty Harry series, a series he liked as a kid and teenager.","completion":"Elliot's solo celebration with a can of beer and a Dirty Harry movie serves as a reflective and somewhat melancholic scene that punctuates the day's events. After the high tension and emotional complexities of dealing with his father, including the chaotic drive to the airport and the subsequent breakdown of his Volkswagen Golf, retreating to the comfort of a familiar movie underscores Elliot's desire for simplicity and solace in the face of life's complications. Here's how this scenario can be fleshed out to enrich Elliot's character development and the thematic resonance of the story: **Return to Roots**: - Watching a Dirty Harry movie, a favorite from his childhood and teenage years, symbolizes Elliot's need to reconnect with a simpler time in his life, before the current struggles and estrangements. Dirty Harry, a character known for his rugged individualism and defiant courage in the face of adversity, could resonate with Elliot's own sense of determination and his internal battle to uphold his identity against his father's expectations. **Contemplation and Solitude**: - The act of enjoying a beer while watching the movie alone at home could serve as a moment of contemplation for Elliot. It's a space where he can process the day's events and his ongoing challenges without external pressures. This solitude isn't depicted as loneliness but as a necessary pause, a breath he takes as he regroups and finds comfort in the familiar. **Symbolism of the Movie Choice**: - Choosing a film from the Dirty Harry series, which epitomizes the struggle against corruption and the fight for personal justice, could symbolize Elliot's own internal and external battles. It mirrors his struggle for autonomy and the inertia of confronting familial issues, conveying a subtle message about his psyche and the type of hero with whom he identifies. **Emotional Complexity**: - This scene, though seemingly straightforward, is rich in emotional layers. On one hand, it represents a retreat into nostalgia and the security of the known, a temporary escape from his problems. On the other, it's a reaffirmation of Elliot's enduring spirit, much like the relentless determination of Dirty Harry Callahan. This duality echoes throughout Elliot's story, where moments of vulnerability and strength intermingle. **Character Growth**: - Following the tumultuous encounter with his father and the breakdown of his car, choosing to spend the evening this way could also mark a moment of clarity for Elliot. It subtly signifies a step towards accepting the complexity of his emotions regarding his father and recognizing the strength in solitude and self-care. This personal time could be a catalyst for change, where Elliot begins to more confidently navigate his path forward, drawing strength from his roots while acknowledging his growth. **Reflection and Resolution**: - As the movie plays, Elliot's reflections on the day and his life thus far could serve as a narrative device to delve deeper into his thoughts and feelings, offering insights without the need for dialogue. The choice of such an evening indicates a momentary resolution, a peace made with the turbulence of his current life, and perhaps, a renewed resolve to face tomorrow with a Dirty Harry-esque grit. This quiet conclusion to an emotionally charged day allows readers to delve deeper into Elliot's character, offering a stark, introspective pause that showcases his resilience, his longing for connection, and his continuous journey towards self-understanding and acceptance."},{"prompt":"One dream that Elliot has is visiting his family home that is currently being inhabited by clones of him. Two are casually playing on the console, another is outside making a grill and the other is busy sleeping in the bedroom. The one playing on the console casually tells him, \\"Hey dude\\" and the one making a grill outside tells him \\"Hi, son.\\".","completion":"Elliot's dream, populated by clones of himself performing various activities around his family home, is a fascinating narrative device that offers a surreal, introspective look into his subconscious. This dream can be interpreted in several ways, each clone representing different aspects of Elliot's psyche, his desires, regrets, and perhaps even his unresolved issues. Here's a deeper dive into what this captivating dream sequence might signify: **The Clones Engaged in Leisure Activities**: - The two clones casually playing on the console might symbolize Elliot's longing for simpler times, particularly his childhood or adolescent years when life was presumably less complicated, and joy could be found in straightforward pleasures like video games. Their casual greeting, \\"Hey dude,\\" suggests a familiarity and ease Elliot might be missing in his waking life, reflecting a desire for self-acceptance and internal peace. **The Clone Making a Grill Outside**: - This clone represents perhaps the aspect of Elliot that yearns for normalcy and stability—the part of him that seeks to embody traditional roles of providing and caretaking. The greeting, \\"Hi, son,\\" could indicate Elliot's complex relationship with parental figures, encompassing his desire to both reconcile with the figure of authority he lacked and to nurture himself in ways he feels he wasn't nurtured. **The Clone Sleeping in the Bedroom**: - The sleeping clone might symbolize Elliot’s need for rest and escape from his burdens. It could also reflect a part of him that remains dormant or neglected, such as personal aspirations or facets of his identity he's yet to fully explore or embrace. This clone's presence in the bedroom, a personal and private space, underscores the theme of introspection and the parts of Elliot’s life that are \\"asleep\\" or on hold. **Interpretation of the Dream**: - Overall, this dream could be Elliot's subconscious processing his identities, roles, and the internal conflicts he faces. Each clone doing something different yet mundane underscores a yearning for balance between leisure, responsibility, and personal growth. The dream setting in his family home suggests that his foundational experiences and relationships deeply influence his desires and conflicts. **Narrative Potential**: - This dream sequence offers rich narrative potential, allowing for character development and exploration of themes such as self-identity, healing from past trauma, and the journey toward understanding and integrating the various facets of one's personality. Following this dream, Elliot might experience a renewed perspective on his life's direction, recognizing the multiplicity of his desires and the complexity of his inner world. **Connection to the Storyline**: - Integrating this dream into the storyline could provide a pivotal moment for Elliot, prompting him to reflect on his relationships, his coping mechanisms, and his neglected needs or ambitions. It's a call for Elliot to confront and reconcile the various aspects of himself, pushing him toward a narrative arc of self-discovery and acceptance. Elliot's dream is a compelling narrative tool that subtly communicates the internal landscape of a character. It opens a window into his soul for both the reader and, potentially, for Elliot himself, setting the stage for deeper exploration of personal growth and the quest for an integrated, authentic self."},{"prompt":"Two characters that we meet only 70% through the story are his older brother and grandfather. His grandfather kind of looks like Kleiner from Half-Life 2, is a college professor, loves his grandkids and is very disapproving of his son's (Elliot's dad) behavior. His older brother's name is John and he only sent letters but when we meet him, he is married, has a wife and kid. He is somewhere in his early 40s. He served in the Gulf War as a rifleman. In his childhood, John was very protective of his younger brother when he would visit. He introduced him to bands like Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana and mentions how his son listens to stuff like Linkin Park and MCR and is going through, a emo phase.","completion":"Introducing Elliot's older brother, John, and their grandfather 70% through the story adds layers of depth to the narrative, offering new insights into family dynamics and providing Elliot with pivotal support and understanding at a crucial moment in his narrative arc. Here's how these characters could enrich the story and influence Elliot's journey: **Grandfather's Role**: - The grandfather, with his resemblance to Kleiner from Half-Life 2, introduces a figure of wisdom and quirkiness. Being a college professor and disapproving of his son's behavior towards Elliot, he represents a beacon of intellectual and emotional support. His presence could offer a contrast to Elliot's father, showcasing a different model of masculinity and authority that is based on encouragement and understanding rather than criticism and abuse. The portrayal of a loving, disapproving grandfather can illuminate the generational divide in parenting approaches and emotional expression within the family. **Grandfather and Elliot**: - Their interactions can provide Elliot with a sense of validation and acceptance he sorely lacks from his father. This relationship could also explore themes of academic curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge versus the often-narrow definitions of success that Elliot's father seems to embody. The grandfather's background as a college professor might also inspire Elliot or influence his future choices, showing the positive impact of a supportive familial relationship on personal growth. **John's Introduction**: - John's revelation as a protective older brother who served as a rifleman in the Gulf War and introduced Elliot to influential bands, adds a layer of complexity to the family's narrative. His protective nature and role as a cultural and emotional mentor to Elliot during their childhood contrast sharply with the distance imposed by years and life circumstances, symbolized by their communication through letters. **John's Family**: - Meeting John's family introduces Elliot to another model of family life, one presumably built on care, respect, and shared experiences. Learning about John's son experiencing an emo phase and listening to Linkin Park and MCR connects the generations through music, suggesting cycles of emotional exploration and expression. It's a gentle reminder of the importance of understanding and patience in family relationships, which might offer Elliot a new perspective on his struggles and relationships. **Narrative Impact of John and the Grandfather**: - The interactions among Elliot, John, and their grandfather can serve as a catalyst for Elliot's understanding of his family dynamics, offering him new coping mechanisms and possibly aiding in his reconciliation process with his past. It could facilitate moments of healing, where Elliot sees possibilities for different kinds of relationships and begins to forgive or understand his father's shortcomings in the light of broader familial patterns. **Story Integration**: - By weaving these characters into the narrative at a significant juncture, you provide Elliot and the readers with a moment of reprieve and reflection. The characters' introductions serve not only to enrich the backstory but to offer perspective, healing, and potentially, a way forward for Elliot. **Familial Bonds and Music**: - Music, serving as a recurring motif through the love shared by John and his son, as well as Elliot's own interests, symbolizes the timeless and universal pursuit of identity and belonging through artistic expression. It could lead to touching moments where Elliot connects with his nephew over shared musical tastes, bridging the gap between generations and helping to heal familial wounds. In summary, John and the grandfather's entrance into the story can significantly affect Elliot's emotional landscape, providing much-needed familial support, presenting alternatives to the negative influence of their father, and highlighting the healing power of understanding and connection within fractured families. Through these characters, the narrative can explore themes of legacy, growth, redemption, and the unbreakable bonds that can exist within families, even in the face of deep-seated issues."},{"prompt":"Next day is a big day!

From this point on, the story follows Elliot's relationship with Rebecca, them growing closer & closer and finally, The Big Step Forward, as I like to dub it aka, asking her to marry him.","completion":"The upcoming return of Rebecca to New York City marks a pivotal and deeply emotional moment in Elliot's life, setting in motion a new chapter focused on growth, connection, and the exploration of their relationship.

These could range from external pressures (career decisions, family expectations, social dynamics) to internal conflicts (fears of commitment, past trauma). Overcoming these hurdles can serve to strengthen their bond, illustrating the power of love and mutual support. **The Big Step Forward**: - Elliot’s proposal, or \\"The Big Step Forward,\\" is a culmination of their journey together and individually. Leading up to this moment, the narrative can explore Elliot's internal deliberations, his desires for the future, and the symbolic significance of moving forward with Rebecca.

It's a cathartic moment that not only seals their commitment but also serves as a triumph over the struggles and doubts they've faced individually and together. **Elliot's Act of Defiance**: - Elliot spitting on his dad's polished loafer at his wedding is a bold, if not controversial, act of defiance.

Choosing the right approach depends on your specific goals, the nature of your content, and your audience. Here’s a breakdown: # Boosted Post **Pros:** 1. **Ease of Use:** Boosting a post is straightforward and can be done directly from your page. It’s ideal for those unfamiliar with the Facebook Ads Manager. 2. **Engagement Focus:** If your primary goal is to increase likes, comments, shares, and overall visibility of a particular post, boosting can be effective. 3. **Speed:** Boosting a post is quick, making it suitable for content that is timely or for those looking for a fast way to increase visibility. **Cons:** 1. **Limited Customization:** You have less control over targeting options compared to manual ads. This could lead to less efficient use of your budget if your post reaches people less likely to engage with architectural content. 2. **Objectives:** Boosted posts are limited in objectives. If your goal is to generate leads or direct traffic to a website (outside of getting engagement on the post itself), this might not be the best option. # Manual Ad **Pros:** 1. **Versatility and Control:** With manual ads, you have more options for ad objectives (e.g., lead generation, website traffic, conversions). You can tailor your campaign based on what action you want your audience to take. 2. **Targeting:** Manual ads allow for more detailed targeting, including demographics, interests, behaviors, and more. This ensures your ad is seen by those most likely to be interested in your architectural services. 3. **Creative Options:** You can use different ad formats that might be more engaging for your target audience, such as carousel ads, video ads, or slideshows, which are not options when you simply boost a post. **Cons:** 1. **Complexity:** Creating a manual ad campaign requires more time and a better understanding of the Facebook Ads Manager. It can be daunting for beginners. 2. **Testing and Optimization:** To get the most out of your budget, you’ll need to test different ad sets, which can be more time-consuming and complex compared to boosting a post. # Conclusion With a budget of 100 INR, every penny counts, and your strategy should be cost-effective: - If your goal is to **maximize engagement** on a specific post that showcases your work or insights about architecture, **boosting a post** might be the way to go. Given the small budget, it's a straightforward way to gain some visibility and engage your existing followers. - If you're looking to **achieve a specific objective** beyond engagement, such as driving traffic to your website, generating leads, or promoting a service, **creating a manual ad** would be better. You'll have more control over targeting and optimizing your ad to ensure it's seen by potential clients. Given the budget, you should also consider other factors such as the quality of the content you're promoting, the relevance to your target audience, and the timing of your campaign. For architectural firms, showcasing unique projects, architectural innovations, or client testimonials can resonate well. Regardless of the route you choose, ensure your content is high-quality and relevant to your audience’s interests. Monitor results closely and don’t hesitate to adjust your strategy based on the performance data Facebook provides."},{"prompt":"Теперь ты максимально точный симулятор государства и внешней политики.

As of my last update, there isn't a specific model by the name \\"text-Bison,\\" but the approach to training a large-scale AI model on GCP remains consistent across various technologies. The instructions below are generalized for running large-scale AI model training, applicable to almost any advanced machine learning model: # Step 1: Set Up Your GCP Environment 1. **Create a GCP account**: If you haven't already, sign up and set up billing. Google Cloud frequently offers free credits to new users. 2. **Create a new project**: In the Google Cloud Console, create a new project for your training task. This helps in managing resources and billing separately from other activities. 3. **Enable APIs**: Ensure that Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, AI Platform, and any other necessary APIs are enabled. You can do this in the API & Services dashboard. 4. **Set up Cloud Storage**: Create a new Cloud Storage bucket in your project. This bucket will be used to store training data, models, and any other artifacts. Make sure to choose a region close to where your computing resources will be for faster data access. # Step 2: Prepare Your Data 1. **Gather and Preprocess Data**: Collect the data necessary for training your model. Considering you're aiming for a text-to-image model, you'll likely need a large dataset of text-image pairs. Your data might need preprocessing to transform it into a format suitable for your model. 2. **Upload Data to Cloud Storage**: Once your data is ready, upload it to your Cloud Storage bucket. This makes it accessible for training in the cloud. # Step 3: Set Up Your Training Environment 1. **Choose a Machine Learning Framework and Environment**: Decide on a framework like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. You'll also need to choose whether to use AI Platform for managed services, Compute Engine VMs, or Kubernetes Engine for more customized environments. 2. **Select and Configure Compute Resources**: Depending on your model's requirements, select suitable virtual machine (VM) types, GPUs, and other compute resources. For large models, you might need high-memory VMs or VMs with attached GPUs for faster training. 3. **Prepare Your Training Code**: Adapt your model's training script to run in the cloud. Ensure it can read from and write to Cloud Storage. If using AI Platform, structure your code according to Google's training job requirements. # Step 4: Train Your Model 1. **Launch Training Job**: Using either the gcloud command-line tool or the Cloud Console, submit your training job. The specific command or steps will depend on whether you're using AI Platform, Compute Engine VMs, or another service. For AI Platform, a submission might look like: \`\`\` gcloud ai-platform jobs submit training JOB_NAME --job-dir JOB_DIR --runtime-version X.X --python-version 3.X --module-name trainer.task --package-path ./trainer --region REGION --scale-tier CUSTOM --master-machine-type MACHINE_TYPE --master-accelerator count=GPU_COUNT,type=GPU_TYPE -- --train-files TRAIN_FILES --eval-files EVAL_FILES \`\`\` This is just an example. Parameters like \`--runtime-version\`, \`--python-version\`, \`--module-name\`, etc., need to be adjusted based on your environment and codebase. 2. **Monitor Training Job**: Use GCP's monitoring tools to keep an eye on your job's progress, resource usage, and any potential errors. Adjust resources and parameters as necessary. 3. **Save and Export Model**: Once training is complete, save your trained model to your Cloud Storage bucket. From there, you can deploy it for inference. # Step 5: Deploy and Serve Your Model After training, you'll likely want to deploy your model to make it accessible for inference. GCP offers AI Platform Prediction for managed model serving, or you can set up a custom serving infrastructure using GKE or Compute Engine. # Step 6: Continuous Improvement and Scaling As with any machine learning project, once your model is deployed, you'll want to continually monitor its performance, retrain with new data as needed, and scale your serving infrastructure to match demand. # Note: The steps outlined are generalized and will vary based on the specifics of your project, the model architecture, the size of your dataset, and other factors. Always refer to Google Cloud's latest documentation for specific commands, configurations, and best practices."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Anything that the state can do to reduce the costs of discovery of, for example, minerals (e.g. oil drilling) will affect their value. The state can change the state of development of science and technology via its investment in education and research. The state invests resources in transforming the physical/ natural environment as well (e.g. irrigating a dry area or increasing an area’s geographical accessibility). A commodity must be produced at its value, within a given geographical territory defined by the commodity circulation. It could be the area under the jurisdiction of the nation-state, and it could be the world market, which is where the law of value ultimately operates. If an enterprise spends x minutes to produce a laptop, while the average amount of time taken to produce a laptop is x/2 minutes, that enterprise runs the risk of going out of business, unless it is subsidized by the state bridging the gap between the individual and social value. By supporting capitalist commodity relations, the state supports some capitals better than other capitals. By investing in science and technology and through other measures, the state can create a situation where the value of commodities produced by capital under its territorial jurisdiction is reduced below the global average and where a country’s global competitiveness is thus enhanced. 3 The state, the ‘peculiar commodity’, and the labour circuit Commodities (e.g. corn, computer, genetically engineered seeds, Artificial Intelligence, education in private schools) are all products of human labour. In capitalism, the labour that produces commodities is itself a commodity (we are abstracting from the labour of a small-scale producer working on own account). ‘It is only from this moment that the produce of labour universally becomes a commodity’ (Marx, 1887: 124). In capitalist enterprises, wage-workers do not sell to the owner the products that they produce. They sell labour power. Labour power or the ‘capacity for labour’ is ‘the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being’, which they exercise whenever they produce a use-value (ibid.: 119). Labour power is a peculiar commodity unlike other animate and inanimate commodities. The state has to maintain this peculiarity, which has many aspects. So an important form of commodity exchange in capitalism is the one between the seller of labour power (worker) and the buyer of labour power (capitalist) who function ‘as free persons, as independent owners of commodities; the one possessing money and means of production, the other labourpower’ (Marx, 1887: 272). The sale and purchase of labour power requires a certain condition which has to be produced: double freedom of labour. The first aspect of this freedom is that people are economically forced to sell their labour power because they possess no means of production.11 This is a negative freedom which is discussed in the next chapter. The second aspect of the double freedom is that the person must be free from any obstacle to them, freely selling their labour power. This freedom, a positive freedom, exists only when the seller is the sole owner of the commodity, who does not sell himself/herself but only their ability to work for a certain number of hours every day and week. Unlike a slave labourer, the wage labourer ‘must constantly look upon his labour-power as his own property, his own commodity . . . by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily, for a definite period of time’ (Marx, 1887: 119). Capitalism is indeed characterized by the fact that ‘labour-power can appear upon the market as a commodity only if, and so far as its possessor . . . offers it for sale, or sells it, as a commodity’ (Marx, 1887: 119). For this to happen, they ‘must be the untrammelled owner of’ their capacity for labour, that is, of his or her person (ibid.; italics added). The owner of labour power and ‘the owner of money meet in the market’, and there is only one difference between them: ‘one is buyer, the other seller; both, therefore, equal in the eyes of the law\\" (ibid.; italics added). The state has to make sure that the labour power is a commodity and continues to remain so, that is, a person is not extra-economically forced to sell their labour power to a given buyer/employer and that a person must have the freedom to withdraw selling their labour power when they wish to. Labour freedom, labour’s commodity status, that the state generally seeks to protect, is beneficial to labour and to capital. It is better to work and live as a free labourer than an unfree/slave labourer. Because workers own their commodity labour power, they can sell it to whoever they want to and wherever they want to: if they receive lower wages from buyer b1 in one place than what the buyer b2 in another place offers, then they are free to sell it to b2. To the extent that the buyer, b1, pays lower-than-average wages and can benefit from the unfreedom and immobility of particular sellers of labour power, then he/she (b1) can have a competitive advantage over another buyer (b2). So the state makes sure that no such unfair advantage occurs in the labour market. Individual commodity owners need rules that govern commodity exchange but such rules and mechanisms of maintaining those rules constitute a use-value which cannot be bought and sold for a profit and which cannot therefore be supplied by capitalists because of their self-interested character. This applies to the peculiar commodity (labour power). The capitalist and the worker cannot maintain the labour power in its commodity status: they cannot ensure that the labourer is able to treat ‘his labour-power as his own property’ and he and the owner of money deal with each other ‘on the basis of equal rights’ (italics added) (Marx, 1887: 119). Only the state, characterized by a semblance of the separation from the private interests of workers and capitalists, can do so in the interests of the ‘community’ of workers and capitalists. ‘Wherever free labour is the rule, the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract’ (Marx, 1887: 123). The fact of a free labourer is codified in state laws: ‘[O]nly the independent labourer, and therefore only the labourer legally qualified to act for himself, enters as a vendor of a commodity into a contract with the capitalist’ (italics added) (ibid.: 194). There is a sense in which different types of labour are the same: leather work, scavenging, computer-typing are all equal in that they represent the expenditure of a certain amount of mental and manual energy.12 This fact contributes to the notion of equality in society which is then reflected in state’s laws about equality: all the people are equal before law. So not only does the state maintain the commodity status of the products of labour and of labour power, but also does it maintain the equal status of people involved in different kinds of labour. Like any other commodity, labour power has value. Value of labour power is the average value of the necessary commodified means of subsistence which people need to live. The value of this commodity has some peculiarity, with implications for the state. The value of labour power includes the cost of satisfying different needs (a definite quantity of muscle, brain, and the like is expended, which has to be replaced; shelter, healthcare, education, and so on) and the cost of replacing the people who die. (Wage is the monetary form of this value.) The state plays a role in meeting some of the needs and in regulating how these needs are met. Needs are shaped by the physical environment, which is in turn changed partly by state action (e.g. policies concerning the environment). Habits and expectations and the level of civilization also shape human needs, adding a cultural element to human need. Here also the state plays a role as it partly serves as a repository of human history and memories and subjected to pressure from workers (to expand their needs). If the state is involved in the determination of the value of labour power, it is then involved in production of labour power itself. Some of the state-aided technical change can reduce the value of labour power by shortening the time taken to produce the means of subsistence or to produce the means of production that produce the wage goods. It can affect the cost of the maintenance of labour through policies of taxation of subsistence of items and through its import policies where cheap articles produced abroad enter a national market thus lowering the cost of reproduction. By contributing to the value of labour power in non-commodified forms (e.g. state-funded schools), the state can also lower the value of the bundle of necessaries (i.e. wages that private capital pays), other things constant. A general point to be made here is that the state, to enforce equal exchange involving the sale of labour power and indeed sale of all other commodities, has to be involved in an activity which is not based on equal exchange: for example, the tax that the state receives is a tribute. The commodity relations are characterized by the principle of not only freedom but also equality: commodity owners ‘exchange equivalent for equivalent’. This general principle applies to buyers and sellers of labour power. Not only should sellers of labour power be free to sell their commodity (and that the state seeks to make sure that this happens) but also the price of their commodity, labour power (i.e. wage), should be equal to the cost of its production. Marx generally assumes in Capital vol. 1 that this is the case, but he is also aware that in the real world, this is not.13 Millions of people receive a wage that is below the cost of production of their labour power, including the cost of food and shelter, education for children, and so on. This is indicated partly by the population below the ‘poverty line’ in every country of the world.14 This happens even in advanced countries such as the US.15”翻译为中文","completion":"马克思从抽象中忽略了国家与这些情况可能的关联。国家在减少发现矿产（例如油井钻探）等成本方面能做的任何事情都会影响它们的价值。国家可以通过投资教育和研究改变科学技术的发展状态。国家还投资资源转变物理/自然环境（例如灌溉干旱区或提高某地区的地理可达性）。 商品必须按其价值在由商品流通定义的特定地理领土内生产。这可能是国家管辖的区域，也可能是世界市场，后者是价值规律最终运作的地方。如果一家企业生产一台笔记本电脑需要x分钟，而生产一台笔记本电脑的平均时间是x/2分钟，那么这家企业就有破产的风险，除非国家通过补贴弥补个体和社会价值之间的差异。通过支持资本主义商品关系，国家比其他资本更好地支持一些资本。通过投资科学技术和其他措施，国家可以创建一个使得其领土管辖下生产的商品价值低于全球平均水平的情况，并由此增强一个国家的全球竞争力。 3 国家、‘特殊商品’和劳动循环 商品（例如玉米、电脑、基因工程种子、人工智能、私立学校的教育）都是人类劳动的产物。在资本主义中，生产商品的劳动本身也是一种商品（我们在此忽略了自给自足的小规模生产者的劳动）。‘只有从这一刻起，劳动的产物才普遍成为商品’（马克思，1887年：124页）。在资本主义企业中，雇佣工人不会向所有者出售他们生产的产品。他们出售劳动力。劳动力或‘劳动能力’是‘存在于人类中的那些精神和身体能力的总和’，他们在生产使用价值时会行使这些能力（同上：119页）。劳动力是与其他有生和无生商品不同的特殊商品。国家必须维护这种特殊性，这具有许多方面。 因此，在资本主义中，劳动力出售者（工人）与劳动力购买者（资本家）之间的商品交换是一种重要形式，他们作为‘自由人，作为商品的独立拥有者而行事；一个拥有金钱和生产手段，另一个拥有劳动力’（马克思，1887年：272页）。劳动力的买卖需要一个必须产生的特定条件，即劳动的双重自由。这种自由的第一个方面是人们因为没有生产手段而被迫经济上出售他们的劳动力。这是一个负面自由，我们将在下一章讨论。第二个方面的双重自由是，该人必须自由地出售他们的劳动力，不受任何障碍。这种自由，一种正面自由，仅当卖家是该商品的唯一拥有者时才存在，他们没有出售自己，而只是出售其每天和每周工作一定时间的能力。与奴隶劳工不同，雇佣劳工‘必须始终将其劳动力视为自己的财产，自己的商品……通过临时地，为一定时间段将其置于买家的使用中’（马克思，1887年：119页）。 事实上，资本主义的特点在于‘劳动力只有在其拥有者……将其作为商品出售或作为商品出售时，才能作为商品出现在市场上’（马克思，1887年：119页）。为了实现这一点，他们‘必须是’他们的劳动能力，即他们的人的‘不受阻碍的拥有者’（同上；斜体部分增加）。劳动力的拥有者和‘金钱的拥有者在市场上相遇’，他们之间只有一个区别：‘一个是买家，另一个是卖家；因此，两者在法律眼里是平等的’（同上；斜体部分增加）。国家必须确保劳动力是一种商品并继续保持这种状态，即一个人不会被迫向特定买家/雇主出售他们的劳动力，而且一个人必须有自由随时停止出售他们的劳动力。 劳动自由，劳动的商品状态，是国家通常寻求保护的，这对劳动和资本都有利。作为自由劳工而不是非自由/奴隶劳工工作和生活更好。因为工人拥有他们的商品劳动力，他们可以将其卖给他们想要的任何人和任何地方：如果他们从一个地方的买家b1那里获得的工资低于另一个地方的买家b2提供的工资，那么他们可以自由地将其卖给b2。在买家b1支付的工资低于平均水平，并且可以从特定的劳动力卖家的不自由和不可移动性中获益的程度上，他/她（b1）可以比另一个买家（b2）有竞争优势。因此国家确保劳动市场中没有这种不公平的优势发生。 个体商品拥有者需要规则来管理商品交换，但这种规则和维护这些规则的机制构成了一种使用价值，它不能出于利润而买卖，因此不能由于资本家的自利性格而由他们提供。这适用于特殊商品（劳动力）。资本家和工人不能维持劳动力的商品状态：他们不能确保劳动者能够将‘他的劳动力视为自己的财产’，并且他和金钱的拥有者‘基于平等权利相互交往’（斜体部分增加）（马克思，1887年：119页）。只有国家，具有与工人和资本家的私人利益分离的外表，才能为‘工人和资本家的社区’的利益这样做。‘在自由劳动是规则的地方，法律规定了终止这种合同的方式’（马克思，1887年：123页）。自由劳工的事实被国家法律所规范：‘[O]nly 独立劳工，因此只有法律上有资格代表自己行事的劳工，作为商品的卖主与资本家签订合同’（斜体部分增加）（同上：194页）。 不同类型的劳动有一个意义上是相同的：皮革工作、清道夫、电脑打字都是平等的，因为它们代表了一定量的精神和手工能量的消耗。这一事实有助于构建社会平等的概念，然后反映在国家关于平等的法律中：所有人在法律面前都是平等的。因此，国家不仅维护劳动产品和劳动力的商品状态，还维护从事不同类型劳动的人的平等地位。 像任何其他商品一样，劳动力具有价值。劳动力的价值是人们生活所需的必需商品化生活资料的平均价值。这种商品的价值具有一些特殊性，对国家有所含义。劳动力的价值包括满足不同需求的成本（消耗了一定量的肌肉、大脑等，需要替换；住房、医疗、教育等）和替换死亡人口的成本。（工资是这种价值的货币形式。） 国家在满足某些需求方面发挥作用，并在如何满足这些需求方面进行规范。需求受物理环境影响，而物理环境又部分地通过国家行动改变（例如关于环境的政策）。习惯和期望以及文明水平也塑造了人类需求，增加了人类需求的文化元素。在这里，国家也发挥作用，因为它部分地作为人类历史和记忆的存储库，并受到工人的压力（扩大他们的需求）。 如果国家参与劳动力价值的确定，那么它就参与了劳动力自身的生产。一些国家资助的技术变革可以通过缩短生产生活资料或生产工资品的生产手段所需的时间来降低劳动力的价值。它可以通过对生活资料征税的政策以及通过其进口政策来影响劳动维护的成本，其中便宜的国外生产的商品进入国内市场，从而降低再生产的成本。通过以非商品化形式（例如国家资助的学校）对劳动力价值的贡献，国家也可以降低必需品捆绑包的价值（即私人资本支付的工资），其他条件不变。这里要强调的一个总点是，国家为了实施涉及劳动力出售和实际上所有其他商品出售的平等交换，必须参与一项不基于平等交换的活动：例如，国家收到的税收是一种贡品。 商品关系不仅以自由为原则，还以平等为原则：商品拥有者‘以等价交换等价物’。这一总原则适用于劳动力的买卖双方。不仅劳动力的卖家应该自由出售他们的商品（国家寻求确保这一点发生），而且他们的商品，劳动力（即工资）的价格，应该等于其生产成本。在《资本论》第一卷中，马克思通常假设这是事实，但他也意识到在现实世界中，并非如此。数以百万计的人得到的工资低于其劳动力生产成本，包括食物和住所、儿童教育等费用。这部分通过世界各国的‘贫困线’以下的人口来指示，甚至在美国等发达国家也是如此。"},{"prompt":"请将“The state intervenes on behalf of workers in the realm of exchange (e.g. labour market). This can be understood by using Marx’s formula for simple commodity circulation (C-M-C). C-M-C has to be modified into C-M-C'-R-C. The state connects to each phase of the labour circuit, especially given the fact that ‘[i]n contradistinction . . . to the case of other commodities, there enters into the determination of the value of labour-power a historical and moral element’ (Marx, 1887: 121), which, in turn, is a product of the interaction between class struggle for improvement in living conditions, and state policy. Let us begin with C. The state shapes the determination of the value of the commodity labour power (C): it influences what sorts of commodities are to be included in the value of labour power. The state, within limits, shapes the rate of employment — that is, whether, and to what extent, men and women can indeed sell their labour power for a given wage (M). Often wages fall below the value of labour power, so the state is involved in the determination of the wage (M) through, for example, its wage policy. It may also supplement the private wage with a social wage in the form of various anti-poverty and welfare measures. Through its monetary policy and other policies (including those that put a lot of money in the hands of the super-rich), the state can shape the price of wage goods (that is, it can cause inflation) and therefore the actual size of the basket of wage goods common people can access (C'). The consumption of these commodities, mediated by un-commodified labour including especially of women at home (R), where all kinds of costcutting, thrifty conduct, and financial planning happen, in turn reproduces the commodity labour power (C). The state also intervenes in the sphere of reproduction, where, among other things, the commodities bought with the money wage are processed and consumed, often by women. The state has laws that regulate marriage and parental rights and control over family’s property. The state has a degree of oversight over parents’ role in children’s education and healthcare. On the basis of all these successive phases (C, M, C', and R), the original C (that is used in the workplace) is reproduced anew as C. The cycle continues.16 In terms of a theoretical tendency, the cycle operates at the global scale. And empirically, the cycle increasingly operates at the scale of the world market with the gradual emergence of a global labour market. 4 The state and commodity fetishism Commodity fetishism is an important trait of capitalist society. It refers to the fact that commodities ‘behave’ as if being sold and bought is in an inherent part of being a useful thing, even if it is the case that ‘[s]o far no chemist has ever discovered exchange value either in a pearl or a diamond’ (Marx, 1887: 53). Commodity fetishism means that life in capitalism is objectively based on the fact that if I have a need for a laptop or a lollypop, these must be bought (I cannot have direct access to these), which means that these must be produced and sold for a profit. Commodity fetishism means that, for example, for every potato one has, one wishes to have as many eggplants as possible from the other person one is in an exchange relation with, so these commodities effectively start relating to one another replacing the direct relation between the two people in question. One does not care about the conditions under which the other person is living and working.17 The veil of commodity fetishism is not and cannot be removed ‘until it is treated as production by freely associated people, and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan’ where ‘the labour power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community’ (Marx, 1887: 51—2). But the state is the biggest obstacle to this possibility because it maintains the commodity status of things that people need: it protects the private character of production and the commodity status of the products of labour. The state reproduces a system where the production for sale for profit subordinates the production for directly meeting human needs. The state cannot ensure that society produces things that meet people’s needs, whether ‘they spring from the stomach or from fancy’ (i.e. physical and cultural needs). The state is bound by the law of commodity fetishism. The state is also responsible for keeping the veil of the geographical form of commodity fetishism: because the state, in its national-geographical form, does not allow the rational mobilization of world’s resources across existing national boundaries, without which ‘world-historical existence of individuals’, of the proletariat, mentioned earlier, is not possible. The fetishism of the commodity applies to labour power as a commodity in ways that Marx does not reflect on. This is the fact that the commodity labour power, which exists in the labour market, as meat does in the meat market, ‘behaves’ as if it inherently has an exchange value. This means that people must sell themselves (sell their labour power) for a wage (some money) for them to meet their needs which they inherently possess. Anyone who challenges this fetishism and aspires to a society where everyone contributes to society depending on their abilities and finds opportunities for productive work, and where everyone’s needs are met, will be disciplined by the state. Even the limited amount of welfare some workers might get is made dependent on performing wage work. People accept — and have been taught from childhood to accept — the limits to the state action by accepting the fetishism of labour power as a commodity. The state cannot do anything significant to weaken the commodity status of the only possession that common people have: their ability to work. The only way to live under the capitalist state is to live as wage slaves. 5 The state and counter-tendencies to equality and freedom in commodity relations The sphere of purchase and sale of commodities, including labour power, is ‘a very Eden of the innate rights’ of people, and in this sphere ‘Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham’ alone rule (Marx, 1887: 123). In actual practice, however, this rule is violated, and here as well the state is involved. While the state seeks to, is expected to, ensure labour freedom, it often is the case that labour is not free. In pre-capitalist societies, direct producers could not sell their labour power freely, thanks to various feudal rules. In capitalism, there is also unfree labour in many cases. Child labour itself is unfree labour (Das and Chen, 2019).18 There are at least 150 million child labourers, including at least 60 million girls, in the world now (ILO, 2017). They are not legally qualified to act as sellers of labour power. Many adult labourers — at least 25 million — are also unfree (ibid.). Many of them are under debt bondage, a situation that used to exist in Marx’s time as well. The existence of unfreedom of the sellers of labour power is not an accident. While the general tendency in capitalism is that people have the freedom in the labour market, it is the case that whenever and wherever there is a need on the part of capital to discipline labour in order to extract more surplus value, capital seeks to impose unfreedom on labour (or, convert free labour into unfree labour), suggesting that capital dispossesses labour of its freedom to freely enter and/or exit the labour market (Brass, 2011; Das, 2013). Unfree labour violates an important principle of commodity exchange. The extent of unfree labour depends on the imperative of competition between buyers of labour power as a commodity and their need to competitively cut labour cost, and on the extent of class struggle and resistance against unfree labour. Therefore, there has been a need for the state to take action (as we will see in the next chapter). The state’s non-doing is this: it has not done enough to eliminate unfree labour.19 Labour freedom includes freedom of geographical movement. It is a funda-mental right inside (many) countries.20 Correspondingly, capital’s control over labour as a class includes control in its geographical form, and this shapes state’s own action. While the state is generally committed to promoting free labour, it is also involved in restricting the freedom of labour, in the interest of (sections of) capital in a specific country/region and time. It restricts the movement (out-migration and in-migration) of labour. This means that people cannot sell their commodity (labour power) wherever they like to.21 There are also no compete agreements, sustained by the state, whereby workers are stopped from leaving their current employers.22 There is restriction on labour mobility at the level of the world market. In a world of more than 7 billion people, there are only 164 million migrant workers, the majority being men (ILO, 2018). Capital is much more free to move across countries than labour is. Such restriction is imposed by the state of advanced capitalist countries on labour from the LDCs, while they put pressure on the states of LDCs to allow free movement of capital to exploit labour there. Of course, some states (e.g. the Canadian state) are more friendly towards foreign labour than other states.”翻译为中文","completion":"国家代表工人介入交换领域（例如劳动力市场）。这可以通过使用马克思的简单商品流通公式（C-M-C）来理解。C-M-C必须修改为C-M-C'-R-C。国家连接到劳动循环的每个阶段，尤其是鉴于“与其他商品的情况不同……决定劳动力价值的因素中包括了历史和道德元素”（马克思，1887年：121页），这反过来又是阶级斗争为提高生活条件与国家政策相互作用的产物。 让我们从C开始。国家影响劳动力商品价值（C）的确定：它影响哪些商品应包含在劳动力价值中。国家在一定限度内塑造就业率——即，男性和女性能否以给定工资实际出售他们的劳动力，以及能够在何种程度上出售。工资经常低于劳动力价值，因此国家通过例如工资政策等介入工资（M）的决定。它还可能以各种反贫困和福利措施的形式，用社会工资补充私人工资。通过其货币政策和其他政策（包括那些将大量金钱放在超级富豪手中的政策），国家可以塑造工资商品的价格（即，它可以引起通货膨胀），因此普通人可以获得的工资商品篮子的实际规模（C'）。 这些商品的消费由非商品化的劳动介导，尤其是家中的女性（R），在那里发生各种节省成本、节俭行为和财务规划，反过来再生产劳动力商品（C）。国家还干预再生产领域，在那里，购买的商品通过货币工资被加工和消费，经常是由女性完成的。国家有法律规管婚姻和亲权，以及对家庭财产的控制。国家对父母在儿童教育和健康保健中的角色有一定的监督权。基于所有这些连续阶段（C，M，C'和R），原始的C（在工作场所使用的）以C的形式被重新再生。循环继续。从理论趋势上讲，这个循环在全球范围内操作。实证上，随着全球劳动力市场的逐步出现，这个循环越来越多地在世界市场规模上运作。 国家和商品拜物教 商品拜物教是资本主义社会的一个重要特征。它指的是商品“表现”得好像被买卖是有用事物的固有部分，即使实际上“迄今为止没有化学家在珍珠或钻石中发现过交换价值”（马克思，1887年：53页）。商品拜物教意味着，在资本主义生活中，如果我需要一台笔记本电脑或一个棒棒糖，这些必须被买到（我不能直接获得这些），这意味着这些必须被生产出来并出售以获取利润。商品拜物教意味着，例如，对于每一个人拥有的土豆，他希望从与之交换关系中的另一个人那里得到尽可能多的茄子，因此这些商品有效地开始相互关联，代替了两个相关人之间的直接关系。人们不关心另一个人的生活和工作条件。 商品拜物教的面纱不会也不能被揭开，“直到它被视为自由结合的人们的生产，并且在一个确定的计划下被他们有意识地规范”在这里，“所有不同个体的劳动力有意识地作为社区的联合劳动力施用”（马克思，1887年：51-52页）。但是国家是这种可能性的最大障碍，因为它维持人们需要的事物的商品状态：它保护生产的私人性质和劳动产品的商品状态。国家再现了一个系统，出售利润的生产使得满足人类直接需要的生产处于从属地位。国家无法确保社会生产满足人们的需求，无论“它们是来自胃部还是幻想”（即身体和文化需求）。国家受到商品拜物教的法则约束。国家还负责维持商品拜物教的地理形式的面纱：因为国家以其国家-地理形式不允许跨现有国家边界合理动员世界资源，没有这一点，“个体的世界历史性存在”，即前面提到的无产阶级，就不可能实现。 商品拜物教适用于劳动力作为商品的方式，这是马克思未曾反思的。这是劳动力商品这一事实，它存在于劳动力市场上，就像肉类在肉类市场上一样，“表现”得好像它固有地具有交换价值。这意味着人们必须出售自己（出售他们的劳动力）以换取工资（一些钱）来满足他们固有地拥有的需求。任何挑战这种拜物教并渴望一个每个人根据自己的能力为社会做出贡献、寻找生产性工作机会、满足每个人需求的社会的人，都将受到国家的制裁。即使是一些工人可能获得的有限福利也依赖于进行工资工作。人们接受——并从小就被教导接受——通过接受劳动力作为商品的拜物教来接受国家行动的限制。国家无法做任何重要的事情来削弱普通人唯一拥有的东西的商品状态：他们的工作能力。在资本主义国家下生活的唯一方式是作为工资奴隶生活。 国家与商品关系中平等和自由的反向趋势 商品的购买和销售领域，包括劳动力，在这一领域中，“自由、平等、财产和边沁”独自统治，是人们固有权利的伊甸园（马克思，1887年：123页）。然而，在实际操作中，这一规则被违反，这里也涉及到国家的介入。虽然国家寻求并预期确保劳动自由，但往往是劳动并不自由的情况。在前资本主义社会中，直接生产者由于各种封建规则而不能自由出售他们的劳动力。在资本主义中，也有许多情况下的非自由劳动。儿童劳动本身就是非自由劳动（Das和Chen，2019）。现在世界上至少有1.5亿儿童劳动者，包括至少6000万女孩（ILO，2017）。他们在法律上没有资格作为劳动力的卖家行事。许多成年劳动者——至少2500万——也是非自由的（同上）。他们中的许多人处于债务奴役状态，这种情况在马克思的时代也存在。 劳动力卖家的非自由并非偶然。虽然资本主义的一般趋势是人们在劳动力市场上拥有自由，但事实是，每当并且无论何处，资本有需要纪律劳动以提取更多剩余价值时，资本就寻求对劳动施加非自由（或，将自由劳动转变为非自由劳动），这表明资本剥夺了劳动的自由进入和/或退出劳动力市场的自由（Brass，2011；Das，2013）。非自由劳动违反了商品交换的一个重要原则。非自由劳动的程度取决于劳动力商品的买家之间的竞争压力以及他们为了竞争性降低劳动成本的需要，以及对抗非自由劳动的阶级斗争和抵抗的程度。因此，国家有采取行动的需要（我们将在下一章中看到）。国家的不作为是：它没有做足够的努力来消除非自由劳动。 劳动自由包括地理移动的自由。这是（许多）国家内部的基本权利。相应地，资本对劳动阶级的控制包括其地理形式的控制，这塑造了国家自己的行动。虽然国家通常致力于促进自由劳动，但它也参与限制劳动的自由，符合（部分）资本在特定国家/地区和时间的利益。它限制劳动力的流动（出境和入境移动）。这意味着人们不能将他们的商品（劳动力）出售给他们喜欢的地方。还有国家支持的不竞争协议，阻止工人离开他们当前的雇主。 在世界市场层面上存在对劳动力流动性的限制。在一个超过70亿人口的世界中，只有1.64亿移民工人，其中大多数是男性（ILO，2018）。资本跨国流动的自由度远远高于劳动力。这种限制是发达资本主义国家对来自最不发达国家（LDCs）的劳动力施加的，同时它们对LDCs的国家施压，允许资本自由流动以开发那里的劳动力。当然，一些国家（例如加拿大）对外国劳动力比其他国家更友好。"},{"prompt":"请将“Marx assumes that wages cover the cost of reproduction of labour power, as mentioned earlier. In reality, this is the not the case: wages fall below the value of labour power. And, the state is complicit in this gap. The reason for this is that other things constant, the lower the wages, the higher the surplus value, and it is the role of the state to make sure that a higher rate of surplus value is appropriated by the ruling class. So the state acts to keep wages within limits, in favour of the buyers of labour power. It is the case that ‘during the historic genesis of capitalist production, the bourgeoisie, at its rise, wants and uses the power of the state . . . to force them within the limits suitable for surplus-value making’ (Marx, 1887: 523). During the historical genesis, increasing wages beyond a limit or receiving wages beyond a level invited state penalty. The state makes sure that wages remain within limits so that the capitalist class has a reasonable rate of profit. This situation characterized not only the early stage of capitalism in Europe but also capitalism during the current times, especially in the periphery. In addition, promoting economic globalization (free trade), the states of advanced countries trigger a race to the bottom in terms of wages. This tendency was there during Marx’s time as well to some extent. In 1870s, a British politician remarked: ‘ “If China . . . should become a great manufacturing country, I do not see how the manufacturing population of Europe could sustain the contest without descending to the level of their competitors” (Times, Sept. 3, 1873, p. 8.)’ (Marx, 1887: 430). Marx goes on to say something which is so contemporary: ‘The wished-for goal of English capital is no longer Continental wages but Chinese’ (ibid.). Wages have remained within limits broadly favourable to capital, thanks partly to the state. This is indicated by the decreasing ratio of wages to the value of the product (national income) that workers make.23 When wages rise beyond a point, the state takes step to reduce wages by, for example, raising the interest rate and creating unemployment. Similarly, even if daily or weekly wages increase, the price of labour power per hour (hourly wage) may be reduced because of capitalists prolonging the working day for a given daily wage. In addition, when the per-hour wage during the normal part of the working day is low, this ‘compels the labourer to work during the better paid over-time, if he wishes to obtain a sufficient wage at all’ (Marx, 1887: 386). The state engages in a case of non-doing: it does little to prevent a drop in wages. The level of wages is partly a function of the relative power of capital and labour, as mediated by the state. So complementing the state interventions aimed at regulating wages in favour of capital is the fact that workers’ trade union activity is often restricted or even prevented by the state. This has happened historically, as during Marx’s time.24 This happens in our time.25 It is often criminalized.26 Coercive powers — those of police and army — are used against workers, and these powers are supplemented by capitalists’ own coercive agents, legal or illegal.27 Even when real wages fall, and this happened, for example, in England in the 16th century, causing ‘the condition of the labourers. . . [to] become much worse’ (Marx, 1887: 524), ‘the laws for keeping them down remained in force, together with the ear-clipping and branding of those “whom no one was willing to take into service” ’ (p. 524). Whether or not the ruling classes needed any regulation of wages, it ‘was unwilling in case of necessity to be without the weapons of the old arsenal’ (p. 524). It was only in 1813 that ‘the laws for the regulation of wages were repealed’ in England (p. 525). The state acts against workers not just in terms of wages and working day. As we have seen, workers and capitalists, as commodity owners, are nominally equal in eyes of the law. ‘The rule of law forbids the dispossessed sellers of labor power and the owners of the means of production equally from stealing bread’ (Bonefeld, 2021: 179). However, in case of a contract-breaking, the state often punishes individual workers more severely than it does individual capitalists.28 A peculiar character of labour power as a commodity is its ‘perishability’. If a sweet potato is not sold for a couple of days, or if a machine is not sold for a few weeks, their use-value will not be affected. This is not true about the labour power. If a person cannot find wage work, that is, ‘If his [or her] capacity for labour remains unsold, the labourer derives no benefit from it’, but there is ‘a cruel nature-imposed necessity that this capacity has cost for its production a definite amount of the means of subsistence’ (Marx, 1887: 122). This commodity (labour power) cannot be separated from its owner and kept in a fridge. Labour power has a bodily location: it inheres in the bearer of the commodity. If it is not reproduced through regular consumption of food, clothing, medicine, and so on, its possessor, a human being, will simply die The body is the bearer of labour power.29 Note also that bearers of commodity labour power have feelings. Loss of work — not being hired by anyone (rejection) — hurts men and women emotionally, which is why there is a strong association between depression and unemployment (Dooley et al., 2000). The state is directly or otherwise responsible for the immense emotional suffering of the working class. The body has to be reproduced for the continued mental and physical existence of labour power. This is possible only when the buyers (capitalists) buy labour power, and the buyers will buy it only when they can make a profit off it. The state does not guarantee that people can sell the only commodity they possess, with a decent price for the commodity (i.e. a good compensation). This is state’s non-doing. This non-doing has enormous consequence for people. The state is directly or otherwise responsible for immense economic and emotional suffering of the working class. And to the extent that being unemployed/under-employed and earning a very low income weakens workers’ bargaining power (and to the extent that, one may add, the state fails to ensure a remunerative price for small-scale producers), state’s non-doing has adverse political impact on the masses, as far as their relation to the state and capitalists is concerned. Consider a wage strike in response to the fact that workers are not paid a wage to cover the cost of maintenance. What happens to the two types of commodity owners who are considered equal in the eyes of state laws? Capitalists do not make money during a strike, but they do not die because of the lack of food and shelter. If workers do not work and do not have food and other necessaries, for a few weeks, they will simply die. The question is this: what happens if the state feeds the workers every time they go on a strike. This would help the workers keep the use-value of their commodity intact; they would remain ‘the guardian’ of their commodity. This would therefore break the intransigence of the buyers of labour power. The state not feeding the workers during a strike or when they are locked out by employers, this act of not-doing, is also an act of doing: it is an intervention on behalf of the buyers of commodity labour power and against the sellers of that commodity. For there to be equal exchange, there has to be an exchange, and for there to be an exchange, there have to be owners of commodities, but the state fails to make sure that workers remain commodity owners and that they indeed remain bodily alive. Capital and labour — or the capitalist as the personification of the imperative to accumulate capital, and the labourer as the personification of labour time — cannot be equal in reality, no matter how equal they might seem as commodity own- ers/sellers and in the eyes of the state. Consider small-scale producers. Many of them produce commodities for large-scale companies. If they go on a strike, refusing to deliver their products unless a better price is paid, and if the strike continues for several weeks, not only do they not have much saving to live on but also do their products may lose their use-value (they may go rotten, for example). What would happen if the state supplied large-scale refrigeration facilities to these farmers and an income support during the strike? This would allow these commodity producers to engage in a transaction based on ‘the equivalent for the equivalent’ with the large-scale buyers of their commodity. The state does not do this. No wonder, hundreds of thousands of farmers commit suicide every year in the world, including in India and in African countries. The very process of commodity exchange, which is supposed to be equal and voluntary and is supposed to benefit all, kills many people who are involved in that process. This fact goes against the most fundamental presupposition of commodity exchange: commodity owners must live to exchange commodities. The much-discussed right to life — which the state supports at a general level — in bourgeois discourse is vacuous therefore. Often there is more concern for the right to life of animals (e.g. holy cows for Hindus, other animals that animal rights activists care much about) and of unborn babies (for sections of the Christian community) than for human beings who die because they cannot sell the only possession they have (usually their ability to work) (or some crop, as in the case of small-scale producers). Every day 25,000 people — including 10,000 children — die because of hunger: that is, more than 40 people — including 15 children — every second (Holmes, n.d.). Some 854 million people worldwide are estimated to be undernourished, and they experience slow death every day. Marx (1887: 122) decides ‘to assume provisionally, that the possessor of labour-power, on the occasion of each sale, immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for it’. In reality, workers are paid several weeks after they perform their work. In this sense, the use-value of the labour power — labour — is given as a loan to the capitalist. There are many potential consequences of workers’ loan to the capitalist. Note that independent small-scale producers also receive the payment for their goods weeks and sometimes months after they deliver the products to the state, merchants, ago-industrial capitalists, or many others.”翻译为中文","completion":"马克思假设，工资覆盖了劳动力再生产成本，如前所述。实际上，情况并非如此：工资低于劳动力价值。而国家在这一差距中是同谋。原因是，在其他条件不变的情况下，工资越低，剩余价值越高，国家的角色是确保统治阶级获得更高的剩余价值率。因此，国家行动以保持工资在限度内，有利于劳动力的购买者。事实上，“在资本主义生产的历史起源中，崛起的资产阶级希望并利用国家的力量……将他们强制在适合剩余价值制造的限度内”（马克思，1887年：523页）。在历史起源期间，工资超过一定限度或收入超过一定水平会招致国家的处罚。国家确保工资保持在限度内，以便资本家阶级有一个合理的利润率。这种情况不仅特征于欧洲资本主义的早期阶段，也特征于当前时期的资本主义，尤其是在外围地区。此外，促进经济全球化（自由贸易），发达国家的国家引发了工资的底部竞赛。马克思时代也在某种程度上存在这种倾向。1870年代，一位英国政治家评论道：“如果中国……成为一个伟大的制造国，我不明白欧洲的制造业人口如何在不降低到其竞争对手水平的情况下维持竞争”（《泰晤士报》，1873年9月3日，第8页）（马克思，1887年：430页）。马克思继续说了一些非常具有现代意义的话：“英国资本期望的目标不再是大陆工资，而是中国工资”（同上）。 工资保持在对资本总体有利的限度内，部分得益于国家。这由工人制造的产品（国民收入）价值与工资的比率下降所表明。当工资上升到一定点时，国家采取措施通过例如提高利率和创造失业来降低工资。同样，即使日工资或周工资增加，由于资本家延长给定日工资的工作日，每小时的劳动力价格（小时工资）可能降低。此外，当正常工作日的每小时工资低时，这“迫使劳动者如果想要获得足够的工资，就必须在更高工资的加班时间工作”（马克思，1887年：386页）。国家在不作为的情况下参与：它很少采取措施防止工资下降。 工资水平部分是资本和劳动相对力量的函数，由国家调节。因此，国家干预旨在调节有利于资本的工资，事实是工人的工会活动经常受到国家的限制甚至阻止。这在历史上发生过，如马克思时代。这在我们的时代也发生。它经常被刑事化。强制力量——警察和军队的力量——被用来对抗工人，这些力量得到了资本家自己的强制代理人的补充，无论是合法还是非法。即使实际工资下降，例如在16世纪的英国，导致“劳动者的状况……变得更糟”，“压制他们的法律保持有效，与耳朵割裂和烙印那些‘没有人愿意雇用’的人一起”（第524页）。无论统治阶级是否需要对工资进行任何调节，“它在必要时不愿意没有旧兵工厂的武器”（第524页）。直到1813年，“规定工资的法律在英国被废除”（第525页）。 国家对工人的行动不仅仅在工资和工作日方面。正如我们所看到的，工人和资本家作为商品所有者，在法律眼中名义上是平等的。 “法治同样禁止被剥夺的劳动力卖家和生产资料所有者偷窃食物”（Bonefeld，2021年：179页）。然而，在违反合同的情况下，国家通常对个别工人的惩罚比对个别资本家更为严重。 劳动力作为一种商品的特殊性格是其“易腐性”。如果红薯几天不卖，或者机器几周不卖，它们的使用价值不会受到影响。劳动力不是这样。如果一个人找不到工资工作，即“如果他（或她）的劳动能力未出售，劳动者从中得不到任何好处”，但存在“一种残酷的自然强加的必要性，即这种能力的生产需要一定量的生活资料”（马克思，1887年：122页）。这种商品（劳动力）不能与其所有者分开并保留在冰箱中。劳动力有一个身体位置：它存在于商品的携带者中。如果不通过定期消费食物、衣物、药品等来再生产它，其拥有者，一个人类，将简单地死亡。身体是劳动力的携带者。也要注意，商品劳动力的携带者有感情。失去工作——没有人雇佣（拒绝）——在情感上伤害了男性和女性，这就是为什么失业和抑郁之间存在强烈关联（Dooley et al., 2000）。国家直接或间接负责工人阶级的巨大情感痛苦。 为了继续劳动力的精神和身体存在，身体必须被再生产。只有当购买者（资本家）购买劳动力，并且当他们可以从中获利时，这才可能实现。国家不保证人们可以以体面的价格（即良好的补偿）出售他们唯一拥有的商品。这是国家的不作为。这种不作为对人们有着巨大的后果。国家直接或间接负责工人阶级的巨大经济和情感痛苦。而且，在失业/就业不足和收入非常低削弱工人议价能力的程度上（可以补充说，国家未能确保小规模生产者获得合理价格），国家的不作为对大众与国家和资本家的关系产生了不利的政治影响。 考虑到工人进行罢工以应对无法覆盖维持成本的工资事实，那么在国家法律眼中被视为平等的两种类型的商品所有者会发生什么？在罢工期间，资本家虽然没有赚到钱，但他们不会因缺乏食物和住所而死。如果工人不工作，几周内没有食物和其他必需品，他们将简单地死亡。问题是：如果国家每次工人罢工时都给予工人食物会发生什么。这将帮助工人保持他们商品的使用价值完整；他们将保持他们商品的“守护者”身份。这将打破劳动力购买者的固执。国家在罢工期间或雇主锁门时不给工人提供食物，这种不作为也是一种行为：它是代表商品劳动力购买者而不是卖方的一种干预。为了有平等的交换，必须有交换，为了有交换，必须有商品的所有者，但国家未能确保工人留作商品所有者，并确实保持身体活着。资本和劳动——或者作为积累资本冲动的人格化的资本家，以及作为劳动时间人格化的劳动者——无论他们作为商品所有者/卖家以及在国家眼中看起来多么平等，实际上都不可能平等。 考虑小规模生产者。他们中的许多人为大型公司生产商品。如果他们罢工，拒绝交付产品，除非支付更好的价格，如果罢工持续几周，他们不仅没有足够的储蓄来维生，而且他们的产品可能会失去使用价值（例如可能腐烂）。如果国家为这些农民提供大型冷藏设施和罢工期间的收入支持会怎样呢？这将允许这些商品生产者与他们商品的大规模买家进行基于“等价物换等价物”的交易。国家不做这些。难怪每年有数十万农民在世界上自杀，包括在印度和非洲国家。 商品交换的整个过程，本应是平等和自愿的，对所有人有益，却杀死了许多参与该过程的人。这一事实违背了商品交换的最基本前提：商品所有者必须活着以交换商品。资产阶级话语中被广泛讨论的生命权——国家在一般水平上支持的——因此是空洞的。人们对动物的生命权（例如对印度教徒来说是神圣的奶牛，对动物权利活动家来说是他们非常关心的其他动物）和未出生婴儿的生命权（对基督教社区的一部分来说）的关心往往超过了因为他们不能卖掉他们唯一拥有的东西（通常是他们的劳动能力）（或一些农作物，如小规模生产者的情况）而死去的人类。每天有25,000人——包括10,000名儿童——因饥饿而死：即每秒钟超过40人——包括15名儿童（Holmes，n.d.）。据估计，全球有8.54亿人处于营养不良状态，他们每天都在缓慢死去。 马克思（1887年：122页）决定“暂时假设，劳动力的拥有者在每次出售时都立即收到约定支付的价格”。实际上，工人在执行工作几周后才被支付工资。从这个意义上说，劳动力的使用价值——劳动——被当作贷款给了资本家。工人对资本家的贷款有许多潜在的后果。请注意，独立的小规模生产者也在将产品交付给国家、商人、农业工业资本家或许多其他人后几周甚至几个月才收到付款。"},{"prompt":"from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model # Load the pre-trained model model_y5 = load_model('snn_1142_hlp5_5m_relu_trainloss05_mae12_valloss12_mae14.h5') error: { \\"name\\": \\"AttributeError\\", \\"message\\": \\"partially initialized module 'charset_normalizer' has no attribute 'md__mypyc' (most likely due to a circular import)\\", \\"stack\\": \\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ModuleNotFoundError Traceback (most recent call last) File c:Usersarisa.condaenvstflibsite-packagesrequestscompat.py:11 10 try: ---> 11 import chardet 12 except ImportError: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chardet' During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred: AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[9], line 1 ----> 1 from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model 3 # Load the pre-trained model 4 model_y5 = load_model('snn_1142_hlp5_5m_relu_trainloss05_mae12_valloss12_mae14.h5') File c:Usersarisa.condaenvstflibsite-packagestensorflow__init__.py:51 49 from ._api.v2 import autograph 50 from ._api.v2 import bitwise ---> 51 from ._api.v2 import compat 52 from ._api.v2 import config 53 from ._api.v2 import data File c:Usersarisa.condaenvstflibsite-packagestensorflow_apiv2compat__init__.py:37 3 \\"\\"\\"Compatibility functions. 4 5 The \`tf.compat\` module contains two sets of compatibility functions.

Check for Circular Imports Circular imports happen when two or more modules depend on each other to function. Python allows circular imports if they're handled correctly, but they can lead to problems such as the one you're facing.

Verify Package Installation Corrupt installations can occasionally cause such issues. Consider reinstalling the involved packages (and possibly related dependencies) in your environment to ensure they're correctly installed. # 4. Try a Clean Environment Sometimes, conflicts with other packages or corrupted environment states can lead to issues like this. Creating a fresh virtual environment and installing the necessary packages there can help identify if the issue is environment-specific. \`\`\`bash # Create a new virtual environment python -m venv new_env # Activate the new environment # On Windows new_envScriptsactivate # On Unix or MacOS source new_env/bin/activate # Install TensorFlow and other necessary packages pip install tensorflow \`\`\` # 5. Check Environment Variables In rare cases, environment variables related to Python paths (e.g., \`PYTHONPATH\`) can cause issues with package imports. Ensure these are correctly set or temporarily unset them to test if that resolves the issue. # 6. Report the Issue If after attempting the above steps the issue persists, consider reporting it to the maintainers of the involved packages (particularly \`charset_normalizer\`).

Use a Virtual Environment If you're not already using a virtual environment (though it seems like you might be using conda), strongly consider setting one up.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?","completion":"To solve this problem efficiently in less than O(n^2) time complexity, you can use a hash map (or dictionary in some programming languages) to store each element's value and its index as you iterate through the array. This allows you to check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hash map in constant time. If the complement exists, you have found the two numbers that add up to the target, and you can return their indices. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because it only requires a single pass through the array. Here is how you could implement this in Python: \`\`\`python def twoSum(nums, target): # Create a dictionary to store the value and index of each element num_map = {} # Iterate through the array for i, num in enumerate(nums): # Calculate the complement by subtracting the current number from the target complement = target - num # Check if the complement exists in the dictionary if complement in num_map: # If it does, return the current index and the index of the complement return [num_map[complement], i] # If the complement does not exist, add the current number and its index to the dictionary num_map[num] = i # If no solution is found (this shouldn't happen as per the problem statement), return an empty list return [] # Example usage print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9)) # Output: [0, 1] print(twoSum([3,2,4], 6)) # Output: [1, 2] print(twoSum([3,3], 6)) # Output: [0, 1] \`\`\` This solution iterates through the list exactly once, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array.

Typically, rendering processes, AI-based or not, use the geometric, material, and lighting information provided in a 3D model to produce high-quality images via traditional rendering engines, many of which have been optimized with machine learning techniques for things like denoising images. However, the use of AI in the realm of 3D modeling and rendering is rapidly evolving. Most AI advancements related to 3D models have focused on generative models, enhancing textures, and automating aspects of the design process, rather than the direct rendering of 3D model files. There are a few avenues through which AI intersects with rendering: 1. **Enhanced Rendering Engines**: Some modern rendering engines leverage AI for specific tasks, such as reducing noise in rendered images (NVIDIA's OptiX AI-accelerated denoiser is an example), optimizing rendering processes, or even generating textures. These use the model's data but the AI aspect primarily enhances the speed or quality of the output than interpreting the model in novel ways. 2. **AI Post-Processing**: AI can significantly improve rendered images after they've been processed by a traditional engine, adjusting lighting, color grading, or even adding complex effects that would be computationally expensive to simulate directly. 3. **Generative Design & Model Enhancement**: AI can also play a role in the modeling stage, suggesting design alterations or enhancements, but this is more about creating or modifying the model than rendering it. 4. **AI Interpretation of 3D Data**: Some tools can interpret 3D data and generate images that mimic certain styles, essentially 'reimagining' the model output based on learned artistic styles or parameters. While not a direct rendering in a traditional sense, this approach represents a more creative use of AI. 5. **AI-assisted SketchUp Plugins**: There are plugins and tools that enhance SketchUp's capabilities, including those that might use AI to streamline certain modeling tasks or prepare models in a way that they are better suited for rendering, though these would typically still use a conventional rendering engine for the final image. For a purely AI-driven model-to-render transformation specifically targeting SketchUp models, you would likely need to look at custom solutions or emerging technologies. Researchers and startups are constantly developing new applications of AI in 3D design and rendering, so it's plausible that more direct AI rendering options will become available in the near future. Staying connected with technology news within the architectural visualization and 3D modeling communities is a good way to keep up with these advancements."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Także super dzięki. Ps. Fajnie było by go podmienić na dźwięk, który trochę ciszej gra - bo ten jest za głośny np. w stosunku do innych dźwięków uruchamianych przez przeglądarkę - a nie byłem wstanie z ciszyć dźwięku z downloadera, aby nie zagłuszał mi innych stron.","completion":"Cieszę się, że znalazłeś rozwiązanie swojego problemu z opcją wyłączenia dźwięku w Chrono Download Manager! Co do kwestii zmiany dźwięku na bardziej subtelny, niestety większość rozszerzeń przeglądarek nie oferuje natywnej możliwości zmiany domyślnych dźwięków na inne. Wiele z tych narzędzi jest ograniczonych do prostych funkcji konfiguracyjnych bez opcji dogłębnej personalizacji. Jednak jest kilka sposobów, które możesz rozważyć, by osiągnąć pożądany efekt: 1. **Zewnętrzne Oprogramowanie do Zarządzania Dźwiękiem**: Możesz posłużyć się oprogramowaniem trzeciej strony do regulacji głośności poszczególnych aplikacji. Wiele programów umożliwia precyzyjne kontrole głośności dla każdej aplikacji, co może obejść problem zbyt głośnych dźwięków z jednej specyficznej aplikacji. 2. **Własne Rozwiązania**: Jeśli posiadasz zdolności programistyczne, możesz spróbować stworzyć prosty skrypt albo rozszerzenie, które będzie monitorować zdarzenia pobierania i odtwarzać wybrany przez Ciebie dźwięk w odpowiedniej głośności. To jednak wymaga dość zaawansowanej wiedzy i zrozumienia API przeglądarek. 3. **Kontakt z Twórcami**: Zawsze warto przekazać swoje uwagi i sugestie dotyczące rozszerzenia bezpośrednio do jego twórców. Możliwe, że w przyszłych aktualizacjach dodadzą opcję zmiany dźwięków lub regulacji ich głośności. 4. **Modyfikacja Lokalna**: Teoretycznie, jeśli rozszerzenie jest otwartoźródłowe lub pozwala na dostęp do swoich zasobów, mógłbyś spróbować znaleźć plik dźwiękowy w katalogu rozszerzenia i zastąpić go własnym, cichszym dźwiękiem. Należy jednak być ostrożnym, ponieważ modyfikacje takie mogą zostać nadpisane przy aktualizacji rozszerzenia lub mogą nie być dozwolone przez politykę bezpieczeństwa przeglądarki. Pamiętaj, że każda z powyższych metod może mieć swoje ograniczenia i potencjalne ryzyko, dlatego zawsze podchodź do nich z rozwagą i po odpowiedniej ocenie."},{"prompt":"jak się nazywa dołek na którym się patuje w grze golf?","completion":"Dołek, na który patrzeć się w grze w golfa, nazywany jest \\"dołkiem\\" lub \\"dołem\\" (ang. \\"hole\\"). Pole golfowe składa się z serii takich dołków, a celem gry jest wbicie piłki do dołka za pomocą jak najmniejszej liczby uderzeń. Każdy dołek na polu golfowym posiada określony par, czyli liczbę uderzeń, która jest uważana za standard, aby zakończyć dołek."},{"prompt":"Inaczej zadam pytanie. Kij do patowania nazywa się pater i coś mi się przypomina że jest jakaś nazwa odnośnie rodzaju trawy jaka jest na dołkach przy tym ostatnim ruchu najbliżej dołka wydaje mi się że ta nazwa to coś takiego jak pter green - nie wiem naprowadź mnie proszę.","completion":"Rozumiem, chodzi Ci o specyficzny rodzaj trawy lub obszar na polu golfowym. Blisko słowa, które starasz się przypomnieć, jest termin „putting green” lub po prostu „green”. To jest właśnie ten specjalny obszar wokół dołka, który ma bardzo gładką i równą powierzchnię trawy, umożliwiając dokładne i przewidywalne toczenie się piłki podczas patowania. Trawa na greenie jest koszona na bardzo krótko, aby umożliwić piłce golfowej płynne przemieszczanie się po nim z minimalnym oporem. Właśnie tu gracze wykonują końcowe uderzenie, czyli putt, starając się umieścić piłkę bezpośrednio w dołku. Green jest kluczowym elementem pola golfowego, wymagającym precyzji i umiejętności w finalizacji każdego dołka."},{"prompt":"Czy znasz może w całej historii golfa najdłuższy strzał oddany kijem putter toczonej piłki przez całą drogę tylko po ziemi (bez podskoków, odbić od drzew, kamieni itp., ale ostatecznie może odbić się od flagi) i taki co finalnie zakończył się wpadnięciem piłki do dołka?","completion":"Jednym z rekordowych i najbardziej spektakularnych puttów w historii golfa, który stał się szeroko znany, jest strzał wykonany przez Michaela Phelps'a, słynnego pływaka i wielokrotnego medalistę olimpijskiego. Chociaż Michael Phelps nie jest profesjonalnym golfistą, jego udany putt miał miejsce podczas Pro-Am event na Dunhill Links Championship w 2012 roku. Ten niesamowity putt pokonał dystans około 159 stóp, co przekłada się na niemal 53 metry. Co ważne, piłka toczyła się całą drogę po ziemi, nie robiąc żadnych podskoków ani nie odbijając się od przeszkód, a ostatecznie wpadła do dołka. To było najdłuższe trafienie putt w historii telewizyjnych transmisji golfowych, które zakończyło się sukcesem. Chociaż ten wyczyn nie odpowiada dokładnie kryteriom pytania, gdzie piłka nie mogła odbijać się od flagi, jest to jeden z najbardziej pamiętnych długich puttów, który został udokumentowany i jest często przywoływany jako przykład niezwykłej precyzji i szczęścia w golfie.

Czy to ośmiornica, kałamarnica czy coś innego?","completion":"W serii filmów \\"Piraci z Karaibów\\", Kraken jest mitycznym morskim potworem przedstawianym jako gigantyczne stworzenie przypominające kałamarnicę lub ośmiornicę. Pojawia się szczególnie w filmie \\"Piraci z Karaibów: Skrzynia Umarlaka\\" (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest) jako stwór wezwany przez Davy'ego Jonesa, by polować na nieposłuszne mu dusze oraz atakować statki na morzach. Kraken posiada ogromne macki, którymi może łapać i niszczyć statki, a także wciągać ofiary bezpośrednio do morza. Jego wizerunek w filmie jest zdecydowanie bardziej inspirowany kulturowymi przedstawieniami kałamarnicy, zwłaszcza biorąc pod uwagę wielkość i formę macek. Ta wizja Krakena wywodzi się z różnych mitycznych opowieści oraz folkloru marinistycznego, gdzie stwór ten był często opisywany jako gigantyczne morskie stworzenie przerażające żeglarzy. Warto dodać, że mimo iż zarówno kałamarnice, jak i ośmiornice należą do tej samej klasy głowonogów, Kraken z filmów \\"Piraci z Karaibów\\" wydaje się być bardziej podobny do ogromnych kałamarnic ze względu na swoje proporcje i zachowanie."},{"prompt":"Potrzebuje ten tekst przerobić na zrozumiałego prompta do generatora obrazów SDXL mój tekst: Syrenka Warszawska wykonała profesjonalne uderzenie z \\"tee\\" zwane \\"swingiem\\" grając w golfa, a z pobliskiego stawu wodnego wyłoniła się kłamarnica nazywana w filmie \\"Piraci z Karaibów \\"Krakenem\\" i trafiając go w zaślepkę pirackiego lewego oka, przeszywa go na wylot i leci dalej prosto do dołka golfowego na co wskazuje ilustracyjne smugi, czyli podmuch wiatru - piłeczka golfowa leci prosto na flagę i na dołek na \\"green\\".

Доступность Доступность можем рассматривать как часть времени, когда система была доступна деленную на общее время: [ A = left( frac{Available_Time}{Total_Time} right) times 100% ] где ( Available_Time ) - время доступности сервиса, а ( Total_Time ) - общее рассматриваемое время. Интегральная метрика эффективности Можем объединить вышеупомянутые метрики в единую интегральную метрику эффективности ( IE ), которая учитывает производительность, стоимость использования и доступность: [ IE = alpha times E_{processing} + beta times left( frac{1}{Total_Cost} right) + gamma times A ] где ( alpha ), ( beta ), и ( gamma ) - весовые коэффициенты для балансировки важности каждой метрики. Важно подобрать эти коэффициенты таким образом, чтобы они отражали бизнес-приоритеты приложения. # Анализ и оптимизация Используя данную модель, можно производить анализ различных конфигураций облачной архитектуры, изменяя параметры облачных функций и наблюдая за изменениями в интегральной метрике эффективности ( IE ). Целью является максимизация ( IE ) путем подбора оптимальных параметров. Этот подход требует дальнейшего количественного анализа данных о производительности и стоимости для настройки модели под специфику рассматриваемого приложения и облачной платформы."},{"prompt":"найдешь ли ты мобильные приложения, которые публикуют информацию об эффективности облачных технологий ?","completion":"На текущий момент не существует специализированных мобильных приложений, полностью посвященных публикации информации исключительно об эффективности облачных технологий.

Here's a breakdown of what to consider and why: **1. Middle Row, Center Seats:** Universally, the middle row towards the center of the theater is considered prime real estate in cinema seating. This position ensures that you're in line with the center of the screen, making the viewing experience more immersive. The audio-visual sync is best here, as sound designers often calibrate movie audio for the center of the theater. For a standard cinema, try to sit about two-thirds of the way back. **2. Comfort & Privacy:** If it's a date night, you might want more privacy and comfort. Some modern cinemas offer premium seating options like recliners or love seats without armrests, enhancing comfort and making the experience more intimate. **3. Viewing Angle and Screen Size:** The ideal viewing angle is also important. THX recommends a 36-degree viewing angle for the best cinematic experience. Depending on the screen size and the layout of the theater, this might adjust where the best seats are but sticking to the center and considering the distance from the screen based on this angle will help you find a great spot. **4. Avoiding the Front Row and Extreme Sides:** The front row can lead to neck strain and an overwhelming screen size which can detract from your ability to follow the action cohesively. Seats on the far sides can distort the image and sound, making the experience less enjoyable. **5. Consider the Specific Theater:** The \\"best seat\\" can vary by theater depending on the screen size, auditorium size, sound system, and type of screening (IMAX, Dolby Cinema, etc.). For IMAX or large-format screens, sitting further back is usually better. **6. Personal Preference:** Finally, personal preference plays a big role. Some people prefer sitting closer for a more immersive experience or might choose aisle seats for easier access to exits. Consider what makes you both comfortable and happy. **Quick Tip:** If you have the option, pre-booking your seats online can be a great way to ensure you get the best seats according to your preferences. Checking seat reviews for specific theaters online can also provide insights into the best spots. Remember, the best seats are subjective and dependent on personal preference, theater design, and the specific screening technology. Experimenting with different locations can also be a fun way to find your preferred spot over time."},{"prompt":"Learning With Pibby: The End of Kikoriki It was a peaceful day in the world of Chamomile Valley Everyone was minding their own business and going on with their days when a sudden rumble took place The world shook as everyone looked around for the possible cause of it In one area, Krash the Rabbit was going on with his daily shenanigans with his best friend, Chiko the Hedgehog, when they noticed the ground shaking They both looked around confused, wondering what was going on, when suddenly, black ooze covered in glitches appeared and slowly moved towards the two Krash, being naïve and curious, went to get a closer look, when he accidentally touched it and the effects started to happen Krash suddenly screamed and tried to escape, but he was sucked in and turned into a lifeless glitched creature He slowly went towards Chiko, but he panicked and ran away towards the nearest source of help Chiko ran until he spotted his other friend, Wally the Ram, sitting outside and writing his poems Chiko approached him and tried to explain what happened, but it only left Wally confused Then, Chiko turned to see Krash quickly heading towards them, so he quickly grabs Wally and runs towards his home They make it to the front door, but before they could head inside, Krash pounces on Wally and passes the corruption onto him They then surround Chiko as they slowly close in on him Meanwhile, more of the glitchy ooze appear in the land and it slowly makes its way towards the rest of the characters Just a small distance away sat the home of Barry the Bear, where he was working on his garden like every other day The ground shook again for a bit and it got Barry concerned Then, his best friend, Dokko the Moose, walked by and greeted the bear, before raising the question of the strange \\"mini earthquakes\\" Barry told him that he noticed them but wasn't sure on what was causing them Dokko started theorizing on what it could be based on some research he did earlier in the day when they first started, and went on about certain things that Barry barely understood due to the big words Dokko used Suddenly, Dokko gets cut off with the distant sound of Chiko screaming in fear The two looked towards where it came from and waited for something to happen, most possibly an explosion from what it's typically But when nothing happened and Dokko was about to continue his explanation, the corrupted ooze appeared and caught Barry's eye He froze in his tracks and stared at the ooze until Dokko took notice and turned around Krash the the other two chased them, as the world got covered in more corrupted ooze The sky was turning dark and the earth began to shake more Barry was still rushing through the land, looking for a place to hide, when he suddenly trips and falls, dropping Dokko and his shovel Dokko crashed onto the ground and quickly got up to help his friend out Barry gets up and dusts himself off, but Krash and co quickly caught up to them The two panic and try to figure out a way to escape when a portal opens in-front of them Krash and co both get distracted by it, giving Dokko and Barry a chance on hiding behind a nearby tree, and out comes a different character that they never seen before She was blue, had long purple hair, and an eyepatch She held a sword and fended off the corrupted trio Dokko and Barry watched from behind the tree as she fought them off, confused on what was going on She suddenly spoke to them and told them to quickly get away to a safe spot while she fought the corrupted characters off They obeyed and quickly ran off The two ran for a while and stopped near a forest to catch their breath Suddenly, the blue character ran to them and quickly asked if they were ok Dokko replied first and then asked what was going on She looked back towards where she came from and quickly explained that, from what she gathered, some form of corruption was affecting cartoons and that she had been fighting them off ever since it started The two glanced at each-other concerned She then introduced herself and talked about where she came from before the corruption happened before going quiet Dokko noticed and nervously asked if that was the reason for her eyepatch She nodded and sighs Barry noticed that she was covered in a red liquid and asked what it was Pibby froze and nervously told him that it's best he didn't know The ground suddenly shook again and Pibby quickly looked towards the horizon A wave of ooze was slowly approaching them, so she told them that they had to leave immediately Before she could open a portal to escape the world, Krash lunges in- front of them and nearly hits Pibby Dokko and Barry both jump back and Pibby quickly tells them to run The three ran as Krash crawls after them, his leg being injured earlier from a stab wound They make their way into the forest and ran in various directions to shake him off Soon they hid behind a tree and Pibby quietly peeks to check if they lost Krash Dokko and Barry catch their breath and sit by a tree to wait things out After a few minutes of waiting, Pibby declared that they were safe, but she told them that because of the land's current state, they couldn't hide out here any longer, reminding the two about her earlier statement about leaving the valley to a safer place Barry quickly asked about the others and if they could go grab them before leaving Dokko was about to reply to his question when Pibby replied to him first She calmly told him in the nicest way possible that as much as she wanted to go back and gather other possible survivors, she didn't want to risk running into any more of those corrupted monsters, and as much as she hated to say or think this, it's possible it's already too late to save the others now Barry understood and took off his hat in respect of his fallen friends, Dokko comforting him as well Pibby sighed and peeked one last time to ensure they were clear to leave the Riki universe She turned and opened a portal to travel to a safe place for the two to hide They watched in awe before Pibby turned to them and signaled them to step through Dokko and Barry glance at each other and stick close as they walk through the portal, Pibby following behind them, taking one final glance at the world The dark substance continue to eat up everything in the land and she could see glimpses of the corrupted creatures looking around for anyone Pibby sighed and turned towards the portal, she steps inside and disappears through the portal The portal then closes shortly after End. Write a story after the glitch was defeated, Phineas and Ferb and their gang appear running away from a Norm Bot (This is the last dimension before the 1st Dimension, this continuation of that fanfic takes place during AT2D) and they wonder what happened","completion":"In a sudden turn of events that none of them could have anticipated, the darkness of the glitch had finally been defeated. The world seemed brighter, safer, yet the remnants of chaos lingered in the air, a reminder of the battles fought and the friends lost. As the last of the corrupted ooze receded like a nightmare at dawn, a new ruckus stirred on the horizon. It was Phineas, Ferb, and their gang of inventive friends, closely pursued by a frenzied Norm Bot. Their energy was infectious, their spirits undampened by the sight of the world they stumbled into—a world still healing from its own kind of apocalypse. \\"Guys, what is that thing, and why does it look so... terminally uncool?\\" Phineas blurted out, momentarily distracting the Norm Bot with his unyielding curiosity. Ferb, ever the man of few words, adjusted his goggles and surveyed the surroundings, noting the peculiar signs of battle and the remaining glitches fading into nonexistence. Perry the Platypus, in his secret agent persona, sprung into action, tangling the Norm Bot in a swift and comedic battle, showcasing moves that drew bewildered looks from Dokko and Barry, who had just stepped out from their shelter, intrigued by the sudden noise. \\"Who are you people, and how did you get here?\\" Barry inquired, his protective instinct over the land, and his newfound friends, kicking in. \\"We're from the Tri-State Area! Well, another dimension of it, technically speaking,\\" Phineas explained with a grin, extending his hand in friendship. \\"I’m Phineas, this is my brother Ferb, and that's Perry... our pet platypus.\\" \\"And,\\" Isabella chimed in, stepping forward with a friendly wave, \\"we're kind of on a mission to stop our inventions from causing any more chaos. That Norm Bot is part of the problem.\\" Before any more could be said, Pibby emerged from the shadows, her presence commanding yet comforting. She had been watching from a distance, ensuring the safety of her new allies. Her eyes fell on the visitors, recognizing the similar thread of determination that she herself carried. \\"You're fighting corruption, too?\\" she asked, her voice a blend of hope and fatigue. Phineas nodded eagerly. \\"Yeah! And we could definitely use someone with your experience. What happened here?\\" Pibby and her companions shared their tale of struggle and sacrifice, of worlds colliding and the fight to protect their existence from an unseen enemy. The story resonated with Phineas and Ferb, who had always believed in the extraordinary. In the spirit of unity and shared goals, the two groups decided to join forces. Perry finally managed to deactivate the Norm Bot with a well-placed kick, setting a precedent for cooperation. Together, they worked on repairing the damages, using Phineas and Ferb's inventive prowess combined with Pibby, Dokko, and Barry's knowledge of their world. They constructed devices to clear the last of the glitches, restore peace to the land, and ensure no more portals would accidentally unleash chaos. As the day turned to night, they celebrated their victory with a feast, the air filled with laughter and stories of adventures spanning dimensions. The integration of their worlds brought new perspectives, new friendships, and a renewed sense of hope. In the end, Phineas and Ferb prepared to return to their dimension, with promises to keep in touch and continue supporting each other across the multiverse. As they stepped through the portal back to their own world, a sense of accomplishment lingered in the air. Pibby, Dokko, and Barry watched them go, aware that their world was forever changed, not just by the glitch but by the bonds formed in the face of adversity. They turned back to their home, ready to rebuild and protect it, inspired by the knowledge that they were not alone in their fight. And as the stars twinkled above, a silent agreement was made among them—no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, drawing strength from the unity that had saved their worlds."},{"prompt":"Write a story where Barry and Dokko look at old images, Barry breaks down crying","completion":"Barry the Bear and Dokko the Moose sat in the quiet solitude of Barry’s living room, a gentle fire crackling in the hearth, casting warm glows over the room filled with memories. It was a chilly evening in Chamomile Valley, one that prompted old friends to seek solace in each other’s company and reminisce about the days long gone by. Dokko had brought with him an old, dust-covered album, its pages yellowed with age, a treasure trove of memories they hadn’t opened in years. “Thought it was about time we took a trip down memory lane,” Dokko said, his voice thick with nostalgia as he laid the album on the table before them. Barry smiled, eager yet apprehensive. He knew the power memories held, how they could transport you back to moments of joy and searing pain with the same intensity. As Dokko flipped open the album, the first page revealed a picture of their younger selves, full of hope and dreams, the entire gang from Chamomile Valley smiling back at them. There they were, Barry and Dokko, side by side with Pibby, Krash, Chiko, and many others whose presence once filled Barry's garden with laughter and joy. Each photograph told a story, a captured moment of their shared adventures, their triumphs, and their losses. As the pages turned, the weight of the years became apparent, not just in the aging faces and changing landscapes, but in the eyes that seemed to carry the wisdom of experiences lived fully and deeply. Then, they reached a section that Dokko hesitated upon. It was dedicated to a particularly adventurous summer that now seemed like a lifetime ago. Each photo was a testament to the unbreakable bond they shared, a reminder of a time when everything seemed possible. Barry’s gaze lingered on a photo taken on a day they had all gone to the river, the sun shining brightly upon their faces, genuine smiles of contentment lighting up their faces. That day was special; it was the kind of day that, in the moment, everyone knew they would cherish forever. A lump formed in Barry's throat as his eyes moved to the next image, one of him sharing a hearty laugh with a friend who was no longer with them. A friend who had been lost to the challenges and battles that came with their later adventures. The room grew silent but for the crackling fire, as Barry's laughter from the photo seemed to echo through the years, a haunting melody of what was. The loss had been a profound turning point for all of them, a reminder of the fragility of their existence even in a world as vibrant as Chamomile Valley. Barry had never fully reconciled with that void, always feeling the absence as if part of him was missing. Tears welled up in Barry's eyes, spilling over as he traced the outline of the photo with a trembling paw. Dokko placed a comforting hoof on Barry’s shoulder, a gesture of understanding and shared sorrow. Words weren't needed; their shared memories spoke volumes, each image a chapter of their shared history, joyful yet tinged with the bittersweet knowledge of those no longer with them. “We had some good times, didn’t we?” Barry managed, his voice breaking with emotion. “The best,” Dokko affirmed, his own voice thick with emotion. “And they live on, Barry. Right here,” he said, tapping gently on the album, then on Barry’s chest, near his heart. “They’re always with us, shaping who we are today.” The room was filled with a profound silence as the two friends sat together, lost in their thoughts and the warmth of their memories. The fire’s glow seemed to embrace them, a beacon of light in the shadow of their reminiscence. As the night deepened, Barry and Dokko continued to look through the album, each photo a step through time, laughter mixing with tears as they celebrated the lives they had led. The album wasn’t just a collection of pictures; it was a testament to the enduring power of friendship, love, and the indelible mark of those who had touched their lives, forever woven into the fabric of their being."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Maybe a lack of music and realistic moves? Also, could toning down the reactions and violence actually feel more mature than screaming and gore?","completion":"Designing combat in a 3D RPG game without glamorizing violence is an insightful approach that can contribute to a more meaningful and thoughtful gameplay experience. There are several strategies that developers can employ to achieve this while still keeping combat engaging and integral to the game. Here are a few suggestions: # 1. **Focus on Strategy and Skill rather than Violence** - Encourage tactical thinking and problem-solving over brute force. For example, players could defeat opponents by outmaneuvering them, exploiting weaknesses, or using the environment to their advantage. - Implement non-lethal takedowns or options for conflict resolution. This could involve subduing opponents or even negotiating with them to avoid direct conflict. # 2. **Realistic Combat Mechanics** - Instead of over-the-top, flashy moves, incorporate realistic combat mechanics that focus on precision and timing. This can make the combat feel more mature and grounded. - Implement a stamina or fatigue system to emphasize the physical toll of combat, adding a layer of realism and strategy to fighting encounters. # 3. **Moderate the Visual and Audio Presentation** - Avoid explicit gore or overly dramatic animations and effects. When a character is defeated, they could be shown as incapacitated rather than gruesomely killed. - Use sound design judiciously. For example, instead of loud, dramatic music and exaggerated sound effects, opt for more subdued ambient sounds that underscore the seriousness of combat without glorifying it. - Animations for both attackers and defenders can be designed to reflect the gravity of their actions, avoiding sensationalizing or trivializing the violence. # 4. **Consequences and Reflection** - Introduce narrative or gameplay consequences for combat. This could involve characters reflecting on their actions, experiencing moral dilemmas, or dealing with the repercussions of their choices in battle. - Offer paths for redemption or learning from violent encounters, perhaps by helping those affected by the player's actions or finding non-violent solutions in future encounters. # 5. **Focus on Defense and Protection** - Emphasize protecting oneself or others, rather than attacking. This could include mechanics like shielding, dodging, and counter-attacks that require skillful timing and positioning. - Design encounters where the primary goal is to defend civilians or allies, shifting the focus from attacking to safeguarding. # 6. **Cultural and Historical Context** - Incorporate cultural or historical contexts that provide a deeper understanding of conflict. This can offer players insights into the causes and consequences of violence, encouraging a more nuanced perspective. # 7. **Psychological Realism** - Reflect the psychological impact of combat on characters, showing that violence is not without its emotional and mental tolls. This can add depth to the narrative and characters, making the experience feel more mature. By adopting these strategies, developers can create engaging and meaningful combat experiences in 3D RPG games that do not glamorize violence. Such an approach can indeed feel more mature and responsible, offering players a richer, more nuanced gameplay experience."},{"prompt":"bulding on this Could soldiers being calm also be realistic in this rpg?","completion":"Yes, soldiers being calm can indeed be portrayed realistically in a 3D RPG and can add a significant layer of depth and realism to the game. In real life, soldiers are often trained to maintain composure and clear thinking under pressure, emphasized as crucial for effective decision-making and performance in combat situations. Implementing this aspect into your game can provide a more nuanced and mature portrayal of combat and its participants. Here’s how it could be incorporated: # 1. **Training and Discipline:** - Reflect the soldiers' training and discipline in their behavior. Show how their rigorous preparation enables them to remain focused and calm, even in the heat of battle. This could be depicted through gameplay mechanics where panic is minimized, and strategic thinking is rewarded. # 2. **Command Structure:** - Incorporate a command structure where orders are given and followed in a calm, collected manner. Communications between characters could be professional and straightforward, suggesting experience and trust in each other's abilities. This can contribute to an atmosphere of competence and seriousness. # 3. **Calm Under Pressure:** - Characters, especially those with military training, could exhibit special abilities or traits that allow them to act more efficiently under stress. This could be represented by gameplay mechanics such as a “composure” meter that affects performance in combat. Players would need to manage this resource, encouraging them to seek tactical positions or make decisions that maintain their composure. # 4. **Realistic Reactions and Consequences:** - While soldiers might be calm during combat, it's important to also explore the consequences of constant exposure to high-stress situations. Showing characters dealing with the aftermath of battle, reflecting on their experiences, or requiring time to mentally recover can offer a realistic portrayal of the psychological impact of combat. # 5. **Non-Verbal Communication:** - Soldiers often rely on non-verbal cues for silent communication in environments where stealth is critical. Implementing this feature could involve hand signals or other gestures, reinforcing the idea of professionalism and calmness. # 6. **Veteran Insight:** - Characters who are seasoned veterans could occasionally share insights or advice with less experienced comrades or the player, offering perspective on keeping calm and making rational decisions during conflicts. This can also serve as a narrative device to explore themes of leadership, experience, and the psychological toll of combat. # 7. **De-escalation and Negotiation:** - Emphasize moments where soldiers use negotiation or other non-combat skills to de-escalate potential conflicts, showing that calmness and clear thinking extend beyond physical combat to include diplomacy and problem-solving. By integrating these aspects, the game can provide a more realistic and mature exploration of combat and its participants. This not only enhances the player's immersion and emotional investment but also promotes a portrayal of conflict that respects the complexities and realities of military engagements and the individuals involved."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A safe and sustainable rate of weight loss is generally considered to be 1-2 pounds per week, which equates to a daily calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories. If your BMR is 1262 calories, you could aim to consume around 1000-1200 calories per day in order to create a calorie deficit and promote weight loss. In terms of exercise, both high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and walking can be effective for weight loss. HIIT workouts are typically shorter in duration but more intense, while walking is a low-impact and accessible form of exercise that can be easily incorporated into your daily routine. Ultimately, the best form of exercise is one that you enjoy and can stick to consistently. It may be beneficial to incorporate a combination of both HIIT and walking into your routine for a well-rounded approach to weight loss. Additionally, if you are new to exercise or have any underlying health conditions, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider or fitness professional before starting a new exercise regimen."},{"prompt":"1200 calorie with exercise or without","completion":"If your BMR is 1262 calories and you are aiming to consume 1200 calories per day to create a calorie deficit and lose weight, you may not necessarily need to exercise to achieve weight loss. However, incorporating exercise into your routine can have additional benefits for overall health, fitness, and weight loss. If you consume 1200 calories per day and burn additional calories through exercise, you will create an even larger calorie deficit and potentially lose weight more quickly. The key is to find a balance that works for you and allows you to maintain a healthy and sustainable weight loss journey. It's important to listen to your body and ensure that you are fueling yourself adequately for both daily activities and any exercise. Remember that sustainable weight loss is about creating healthy habits that you can maintain long-term, so finding a balance between calorie intake and exercise that works for you is key."},{"prompt":"is this BMR smaller than average 26 year women","completion":"BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, weight, height, and muscle mass. The BMR of a 26-year-old woman can vary based on these individual factors. On average, the BMR for a 26-year-old woman is typically higher than 1262 calories per day. However, if you have a lower BMR, it could be influenced by factors such as lower muscle mass, genetics, or a slower metabolism. It's important to keep in mind that everyone's metabolism is unique and can vary. If you are concerned about your BMR or metabolism, it may be helpful to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian who can provide personalized advice and guidance tailored to your individual needs and goals."},{"prompt":"half chicken bread is how much grams","completion":"The weight of a half of a chicken breast can vary depending on the size of the chicken and the specific cut of meat. On average, a whole chicken breast typically weighs between 4 to 8 ounces (113 to 227 grams). This means that half of a chicken breast would weigh approximately 2 to 4 ounces (56 to 113 grams). It's worth noting that the size and weight of a chicken breast can vary depending on how it is prepared and cooked.

العمر. هناك ثلاثة أنواع من الحج: الإفراد، والقران، والتمتع. الحج \\"متمتعًا\\" يعني أداء عمرة في أشهر الحج (شوال، ذو القعدة، والعشر الأولى من ذو الحجة)، ثم الحج في نفس العام. # أركان الحج 1. **الإحرام**: التلبية ونية الدخول في مناسك الحج. 2. **الوقوف بعرفة**: الوقوف بعرفة يوم عرفة، الذي يعتبر جوهر الحج. 3. **طواف الإفاضة**: طواف حول الكعبة بعد الوقوف بعرفة. 4. **السعي بين الصفا والمروة**: استذكار لسعي هاجر بحثا عن الماء. 5. **الحلق أو التقصير**: قص الشعر كرمز للتجديد الروحي. 6. **رمي الجمار**: رمي الجمار في منى، وهو رمز لرفض الشيطان. # واجبات الحج 1. **الإحرام من الميقات**. 2. **الوقوف بعرفات حتى غروب الشمس**. 3. **المبيت بمزدلفة**. 4. **المبيت بمنى في أيام التشريق**. 5. **رمي الجمار بالترتيب**. 6. **طواف الوداع للمغادرين من مكة**. # سنن الحج تشمل سنن الحج الأعمال التي تعتبر مستحبة

من المسجد الحرام بمكة إذا أمكن، الغسل عند الإحرام، واستخدام الطيب قبل الإحرام. يعتبر الحج فرصة عظيمة للمسلمين لتجديد إيمانهم وطلب الغفران من الله، وإقامة صلة أقوى مع المسلمين من جميع أنحاء العالم."},{"prompt":"اريدالمزيد","completion":"بالطبع، يسعدني تقديم المزيد من المعلومات حول الحج، مميزاته، والتفاصيل المتعلقة بمناسكه. # التفاصيل المعمقة لأركان وواجبات الحج الإحرام - الإحرام ليس فقط عن لبس الثياب الخاصة بالحج (للرجال) والنية، بل يشمل أيضًا الامتناع عن عدة أمور مثل الصيد، قطع الشجر في الحرم، استخدام العطور، والزواج في فترة الإحرام. الوقوف بعرفة - يعتبر الوقوف بعرفة من بعد الظهر حتى غروب الشمس من أهم أركان الحج، حيث قال النبي محمد ﷺ: \\"الحج عرفة\\". هذا اليوم له أهمية خاصة للتوبة والدعاء والرجوع إلى الله. طواف الإفاضة والسعي - بعد الفراغ من الوقوف بعرفة وقضاء ليلة بمزدلفة، يتوجه الحجاج إلى منى لرمي جمرة العقبة، ثم يؤدون طواف الإفاضة، والذي يكون بعد طواف القدوم (لمن يؤدي حج التمتع). - السعي بين الصفا والمروة يستذكر البحث المضني لهاجر بين الجبلين باحثة عن الماء لابنها إسماعيل. الحلق أو التقصير - يعد الحلق أو التقصير من شعر الرأس جزءًا من الخروج من الإحرام وبداية عودة للحالة الطبيعية، وفيه إشارة إلى التجديد والتطهير. رمي الجمار - يرمز رمي الجمار إلى رفض إبليس والتمسك بطاعة الله، ويتم تنفيذه في أيام التشريق (11، 12، 13 ذو الحجة)، بعد يوم النحر. # الحج وأبعاده الروحية والاجتماعية الحج ليس فقط مجموعة من الطقوس الدينية، بل هو تجربة روحية عميقة تجمع المسلمين من كل أنحاء العالم على اختلاف جنسياتهم وألوانهم وطبقاتهم الاجتماعية، في مكان واحد، بنفس الزي، وبنفس الهدف، مما يعزز مفهوم الوحدة والتكافل الاجتماعي بين المسلمين. إنها فرصة للتأمل في النفس والتقرب إلى الله، والتغلب على الأنانية والتفكير في الآخرين. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يعد الحج فرصة للمسلمين للتوبة من الذنوب والعودة إلى منازلهم كما ولدتهم أمهاتهم، بنية قوية للعيش بطريقة ترضي الله. إذا كانت هناك أية

world of Chamomile Valley Everyone was minding their own business and going on with their days when a sudden rumble took place The world shook as everyone looked around for the possible cause of it In one area, Krash the Rabbit was going on with his daily shenanigans with his best friend, Chiko the Hedgehog, when they noticed the ground shaking They both looked around confused, wondering what was going on, when suddenly, black ooze covered in glitches appeared and slowly moved towards the two Krash, being naïve and curious, went to get a closer look, when he accidentally touched it and the effects started to happen Krash suddenly screamed and tried to escape, but he was sucked in and turned into a lifeless glitched creature He slowly went towards Chiko, but he panicked and ran away towards the nearest source of help Chiko ran until he spotted his other friend, Wally the Ram, sitting outside and writing his poems Chiko approached him and tried to explain what happened, but it only left Wally confused Then, Chiko turned to see Krash quickly heading towards them, so he quickly grabs Wally and runs towards his home They make it to the front door, but before they could head inside, Krash pounces on Wally and passes the corruption onto him They then surround Chiko as they slowly close in on him Meanwhile, more of the glitchy ooze appear in the land and it slowly makes its way towards the rest of the characters Just a small distance away sat the home of Barry the Bear, where he was working on his garden like every other day The ground shook again for a bit and it got Barry concerned Then, his best friend, Dokko the Moose, walked by and greeted the bear, before raising the question of the strange “mini earthquakes” Barry told him that he noticed them but wasn’t sure on what was causing them Dokko started theorizing on what it could be based on some research he did earlier in the day when they first started, and went on about certain things that Barry barely understood due to the big words Dokko used Suddenly, Dokko gets cut off with the distant sound of Chiko screaming in fear The two looked towards where it came from and waited for something to happen, most possibly an explosion from what it’s typically But when nothing happened and Dokko was about to continue his explanation, the corrupted ooze appeared and caught Barry’s eye He froze in his tracks and stared at the ooze until Dokko took notice and turned around Krash the the other two chased them, as the world got covered in more corrupted ooze The sky was turning dark and the earth began to shake more Barry was still rushing through the land, looking for a place to hide, when he suddenly trips and falls, dropping Dokko and his shovel Dokko crashed onto the ground and quickly got up to help his friend out Barry gets up and dusts himself off, but Krash and co quickly caught up to them The two panic and try to figure out a way to escape when a portal opens in-front of them Krash and co both get distracted by it, giving Dokko and Barry a chance on hiding behind a nearby tree, and out comes a different character that they never seen before She was blue, had long purple hair, and an eyepatch She held a sword and fended off the corrupted trio Dokko and Barry watched from behind the tree as she fought them off, confused on what was going on She suddenly spoke to them and told them to quickly get away to a safe spot while she fought the corrupted characters off They obeyed and quickly ran off The two ran for a while and stopped near a forest to catch their breath Suddenly, the blue character ran to them and quickly asked if they were ok Dokko replied first and then asked what was going on She looked back towards where she came from and quickly explained that, from what she gathered, some form of corruption was affecting cartoons and that she had been fighting them off ever since it started The two glanced at each-other concerned She then introduced herself and talked about where she came from before the corruption happened before going quiet Dokko noticed and nervously asked if that was the reason for her eyepatch She nodded and sighs Barry noticed that she was covered in a red liquid and asked what it was Pibby froze and nervously told him that it’s best he didn’t know The ground suddenly shook again and Pibby quickly looked towards the horizon A wave of ooze was slowly approaching them, so she told them that they had to leave immediately Before she could open a portal to escape the world, Krash lunges in- front of them and nearly hits Pibby Dokko and Barry both jump back and Pibby quickly tells them to run The three ran as Krash crawls after them, his leg being injured earlier from a stab wound They make their way into the forest and ran in various directions to shake him off Soon they hid behind a tree and Pibby quietly peeks to check if they lost Krash Dokko and Barry catch their breath and sit by a tree to wait things out After a few minutes of waiting, Pibby declared that they were safe, but she told them that because of the land’s current state, they couldn’t hide out here any longer, reminding the two about her earlier statement about leaving the valley to a safer place Barry quickly asked about the others and if they could go grab them before leaving Dokko was about to reply to his question when Pibby replied to him first She calmly told him in the nicest way possible that as much as she wanted to go back and gather other possible survivors, she didn’t want to risk running into any more of those corrupted monsters, and as much as she hated to say or think this, it’s possible it’s already too late to save the others now Barry understood and took off his hat in respect of his fallen friends, Dokko comforting him as well Pibby sighed and peeked one last time to ensure they were clear to leave the Riki universe She turned and opened a portal to travel to a safe place for the two to hide They watched in awe before Pibby turned to them and signaled them to step through Dokko and Barry glance at each other and stick close as they walk through the portal, Pibby following behind them, taking one final glance at the world The dark substance continue to eat up everything in the land and she could see glimpses of the corrupted creatures looking around for anyone Pibby sighed and turned towards the portal, she steps inside and disappears through the portal The portal then closes shortly after End. This is where my continuation starts In a sudden turn of events that none of them could have anticipated, the darkness of the glitch had finally been defeated. The world seemed brighter, safer, yet the remnants of chaos lingered in the air, a reminder of the battles fought and the friends lost. As the last of the corrupted ooze receded like a nightmare at dawn, a new ruckus stirred on the horizon. It was Phineas, Ferb, and their gang of inventive friends, closely pursued by a frenzied Norm Bot. Their energy was infectious, their spirits undampened by the sight of the world they stumbled into—a world still healing from its own kind of apocalypse. “Guys, what is that thing, and why does it look so… terminally uncool?” Phineas blurted out, momentarily distracting the Norm Bot with his unyielding curiosity. Ferb, ever the man of few words, adjusted his goggles and surveyed the surroundings, noting the peculiar signs of battle and the remaining glitches fading into nonexistence. Perry the Platypus, in his secret agent persona, sprung into action, tangling the Norm Bot in a swift and comedic battle, showcasing moves that drew bewildered looks from Dokko and Barry, who had just stepped out from their shelter, intrigued by the sudden noise. “Who are you people, and how did you get here?” Barry inquired, his protective instinct over the land, and his newfound friends, kicking in. “We’re from the Tri-State Area! Well, another dimension of it, technically speaking,” Phineas explained with a grin, extending his hand in friendship. “I’m Phineas, this is my brother Ferb, and that’s Perry… our pet platypus.” “And,” Isabella chimed in, stepping forward with a friendly wave, “we’re kind of on a mission to stop our inventions from causing any more chaos. That Norm Bot is part of the problem.” Before any more could be said, Pibby emerged from the shadows, her presence commanding yet comforting. She had been watching from a distance, ensuring the safety of her new allies. Her eyes fell on the visitors, recognizing the similar thread of determination that she herself carried. “You’re fighting corruption, too?” she asked, her voice a blend of hope and fatigue. Phineas nodded eagerly. “Yeah! And we could definitely use someone with your experience. What happened here?” Pibby and her companions shared their tale of struggle and sacrifice, of worlds colliding and the fight to protect their existence from an unseen enemy. The story resonated with Phineas and Ferb, who had always believed in the extraordinary. In the spirit of unity and shared goals, the two groups decided to join forces. Perry finally managed to deactivate the Norm Bot with a well-placed kick, setting a precedent for cooperation. Together, they worked on repairing the damages, using Phineas and Ferb’s inventive prowess combined with Pibby, Dokko, and Barry’s knowledge of their world. They constructed devices to clear the last of the glitches, restore peace to the land, and ensure no more portals would accidentally unleash chaos. As the day turned to night, they celebrated their victory with a feast, the air filled with laughter and stories of adventures spanning dimensions. The integration of their worlds brought new perspectives, new friendships, and a renewed sense of hope. In the end, Phineas and Ferb prepared to return to their dimension, with promises to keep in touch and continue supporting each other across the multiverse. As they stepped through the portal back to their own world, a sense of accomplishment lingered in the air. Pibby, Dokko, and Barry watched them go, aware that their world was forever changed, not just by the glitch but by the bonds formed in the face of adversity. They turned back to their home, ready to rebuild and protect it, inspired by the knowledge that they were not alone in their fight. And as the stars twinkled above, a silent agreement was made among them—no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, drawing strength from the unity that had saved their worlds. Write a story where Barry and Dokko look at old images, Barry breaks down crying Barry the Bear and Dokko the Moose sat in the quiet solitude of Barry’s living room, a gentle fire crackling in the hearth, casting warm glows over the room filled with memories. It was a chilly evening in Chamomile Valley, one that prompted old friends to seek solace in each other’s company and reminisce about the days long gone by. Dokko had brought with him an old, dust-covered album, its pages yellowed with age, a treasure trove of memories they hadn’t opened in years. “Thought it was about time we took a trip down memory lane,” Dokko said, his voice thick with nostalgia as he laid the album on the table before them. Barry smiled, eager yet apprehensive. He knew the power memories held, how they could transport you back to moments of joy and searing pain with the same intensity. As Dokko flipped open the album, the first page revealed a picture of their younger selves, full of hope and dreams, the entire gang from Chamomile Valley smiling back at them. There they were, Barry and Dokko, side by side with Krash, Chiko, Wally, Rosa and many others whose presence once filled Barry’s garden with laughter and joy. Each photograph told a story, a captured moment of their shared adventures, their triumphs, and their losses. As the pages turned, the weight of the years became apparent, not just in the aging faces and changing landscapes, but in the eyes that seemed to carry the wisdom of experiences lived fully and deeply. Then, they reached a section that Dokko hesitated upon. It was dedicated to a particularly adventurous summer that now seemed like a lifetime ago. Each photo was a testament to the unbreakable bond they shared, a reminder of a time when everything seemed possible. Barry’s gaze lingered on a photo taken on a day they had all gone to the river, the sun shining brightly upon their faces, genuine smiles of contentment lighting up their faces. That day was special; it was the kind of day that, in the moment, everyone knew they would cherish forever. A lump formed in Barry’s throat as his eyes moved to the next image, one of him sharing a hearty laugh with a friend who was no longer with them. A friend who had been lost to the challenges and battles that came with their later adventures. The room grew silent but for the crackling fire, as Barry’s laughter from the photo seemed to echo through the years, a haunting melody of what was. The loss had been a profound turning point for all of them, a reminder of the fragility of their existence even in a world as vibrant as Chamomile Valley. Barry had never fully reconciled with that void, always feeling the absence as if part of him was missing. Tears welled up in Barry’s eyes, spilling over as he traced the outline of the photo with a trembling paw. Dokko placed a comforting hoof on Barry’s shoulder, a gesture of understanding and shared sorrow. Words weren’t needed; their shared memories spoke volumes, each image a chapter of their shared history, joyful yet tinged with the bittersweet knowledge of those no longer with them. “We had some good times, didn’t we?” Barry managed, his voice breaking with emotion. “The best,” Dokko affirmed, his own voice thick with emotion. “And they live on, Barry. Right here,” he said, tapping gently on the album, then on Barry’s chest, near his heart. “They’re always with us, shaping who we are today.” The room was filled with a profound silence as the two friends sat together, lost in their thoughts and the warmth of their memories. The fire’s glow seemed to embrace them, a beacon of light in the shadow of their reminiscence. As the night deepened, Barry and Dokko continued to look through the album, each photo a step through time, laughter mixing with tears as they celebrated the lives they had led. The album wasn’t just a collection of pictures; it was a testament to the enduring power of friendship, love, and the indelible mark of those who had touched their lives, forever woven into the fabric of their being. Write a story that Christmas","completion":"In Chamomile Valley, as the first snow of the season began to gently blanket the land, a sense of warmth and anticipation filled the air. It had been a challenging year for Barry the Bear, Dokko the Moose, and the rest of their friends, but with the arrival of the holiday season, there came a glimmer of hope, a chance to rebuild and come together in the spirit of unity and joy. Barry had always loved Christmas, seeing it as a time of magic and wonder, a time when the past could be set aside and the future looked upon with bright eyes. This year, though, the holiday held a deeper meaning. It was the first Christmas since they had lost a dear friend, and Barry felt a bittersweet ache in his heart, a longing for a return to times when laughter easily filled his home. Determined to honor the memory of those they had lost and to celebrate the strength of the bonds that held them together, Barry and Dokko decided to organize a Christmas celebration like no other. It would be a tribute to the enduring spirit of friendship, a night filled with light, laughter, and the magic of togetherness. With a resolve bolstered by the support of his friends, Barry set out to transform his home into a festive wonderland. Strings of lights twinkled like stars against the snowy backdrop, while inside, decorations of red and green adorned every surface, casting a warm, inviting glow. Dokko, with his knack for sourcing rare items, brought in a magnificent Christmas tree that stood tall and proud in the corner of the room, its branches waiting to be adorned with ornaments that each told a story of their shared adventures. Together, they decorated the tree, hanging baubles, tinsel, and handmade decorations, each piece sparking memories and stories that filled the room with laughter and the occasional tear. As Christmas Eve arrived, the friends gathered at Barry's home, their faces alight with the joy of the season. Rosa had prepared a feast that filled the air with mouthwatering aromas, while Wally entertained the group with poems and songs that spoke of hope, renewal, and the beauty of wintertime. The highlight of the evening came when it was time to exchange gifts. In a circle around the glowing Christmas tree, each friend presented their gifts, not just of material things, but of memories, promises of support, and declarations of gratitude for the presence of each other in their lives. Barry shared a special gift he had prepared, a photo album filled with pictures of their past celebrations, each caption a reminder of the love and laughter they shared. As the night drew to a close, Barry stepped outside with Dokko, their breaths visible in the cold night air. The valley lay peaceful under a blanket of snow, the stars above shining brightly, a silent witness to the enduring power of friendship. \\"This Christmas, I've realized something,\\" Barry said, his voice soft but clear in the night. \\"It's not just the joy and the celebrations that make this season special. It's the love we share, the memories we hold dear, and the hope we carry into the future. That's the true magic of Christmas.\\" Dokko nodded, placing a comforting hoof around Barry. \\"And it's a magic that will keep us going, through good times and bad. We've got each other, and that's the best gift of all.\\" With hearts full and spirits lifted, they turned back to the warm glow of the house, ready to face whatever the future might hold, knowing that together, they could overcome anything. Christmas in Chamomile Valley wasn't just a time of celebration; it was a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, love and friendship could light the way."},{"prompt":"Write that 2 usually bubbly friends were still shaken from the ordeal","completion":"In the heart of Chamomile Valley, amidst the flicker of Christmas lights and the laughter that filled Barry’s cozy home, two figures stood slightly apart from the jubilation. Rosa and Chiko, known throughout the valley for their vibrant spirits and infectious laughter, were unusually subdued. While the Christmas celebration around them was a testament to the community's resilience and joy, the shadows of the recent ordeal still lingered in their hearts, casting an invisible veil over their usual sparkle. Rosa, the soul of every gathering with her boundless energy and flair for storytelling, found her smiles less forthcoming. She looked on at the festivities, her eyes reflecting the struggle to fully immerse herself in the joy that enveloped her friends. Beside her, Chiko, whose antics and mischievous adventures with Krash were legendary, stood quietly, a stark contrast to his usually dynamic self. Their friends, too caught up in the warmth of the celebration, might not have noticed the subtle shifts in Rosa and Chiko. However, bonding over years of shared experiences had woven a deep sense of empathy within the group. Barry, with his keen sense of understanding, sensed the weight on Rosa and Chiko’s shoulders. He approached them, his gaze gentle, filled with a concern that mirrored the compassion of the entire valley. \\"Hey,\\" Barry began, his voice a soft invitation to open up. \\"It’s a beautiful night, isn’t it? But it seems a bit bittersweet for you two.\\" Rosa managed a small, wistful smile. \\"Yeah, it's beautiful, Barry. It's just… everything that happened.\\" Her voice trailed off, the memories of the recent chaos, of corruption and battles for survival, clouding her thoughts. Chiko nodded, adding, \\"It’s hard to shake off, you know? Seeing our world, our friends, in danger… it changes you.\\" His words, usually filled with laughter and jest, now carried a weight, a testament to the depth of their recent trials. Barry listened, his heart aching for his friends. He understood all too well the shadows that lingered after a storm, the way moments of fear and loss could dim the brightest of lights. Yet, he also knew the strength of their bonds, the power of their shared resilience. \\"You both have been through so much,\\" Barry acknowledged. \\"But look around you. This,\\" he gestured to the room filled with friends, the ambient glow of Christmas warmth enveloping them, \\"this is what we were fighting for. To have these moments, together.\\" Dokko, overhearing the conversation, chimed in. \\"Barry’s right. And remember, it’s okay not to be okay. We're a family here, ready to lift each other up. Tonight, let’s lean on each other, find strength in our stories, and maybe tomorrow, we'll feel a bit lighter.\\" Encouraged by Dokko’s and Barry’s words, Rosa and Chiko began to share their feelings and fears, their voices growing stronger with each shared memory. The group listened, their presence a silent vow of unwavering support. As the night went on, Rosa’s laughter began to ring out, a little more genuine with each passing moment. Chiko’s eyes brightened, his playful spark reigniting amidst the empathy and understanding of his friends. The Christmas celebration in Chamomile Valley became not just a testament to the joy of the season but a reminder of the healing power of community. That night, Barry, Dokko, Rosa, Chiko, and all their friends discovered that the path to overcoming shadows was through shared moments of love, laughter, and the unwavering promise to stand by each other, no matter what the future held. As the evening drew to a close, the light from the stars above seemed to shine a little brighter, reflecting the renewed hope in Rosa and Chiko’s hearts. The ordeal they had faced together had indeed shaken them, but it had also shown them the unbreakable strength of their bond, the kind that even the darkest of times could not overshadow."},{"prompt":"Write about one friend that quickly went back to his usual self instantly after everything was defeated","completion":"In the aftermath of the corruption that had threatened the very essence of Chamomile Valley, a collective sigh of relief breathed life back into the world. Among the friends who had faced this darkness head-on, Wally the Ram distinguished himself in an unexpected way. Known for his thoughtful nature and often found lost in the realms of his poetry, Wally's usual demeanor was one of contemplation and serene calm. Yet, as the final remnants of the glitch disappeared, chased away by bravery and unity, Wally experienced an instant transformation, one that caught even his closest friends by surprise. As if a switch had been flipped, Wally's solemn, pensive facade burst into an explosion of jubilation. No sooner had the last glitch vanished into the ether than he began bounding around with an energy that seemed to have been stored up for this very moment. His laughter, rich and infectious, filled the air, drawing surprised and delighted looks from everyone around him. \\"Did you see that?!\\" he exclaimed, hopping from one friend to another, his hooves barely touching the ground. \\"We did it! We actually did it!\\" His eyes sparkled with an irrepressible zest for life, a stark contrast to the calm, poetic soul they were accustomed to. This Wally was a whirlwind of excitement, embodying the sheer relief and joy that came with their hard-won victory. While some of the others, like Rosa and Chiko, grappled with the echoes of their recent trials, Wally's immediate bounce-back to not just his normal self but a version even more vibrant surprised many. It wasn't that he felt the ordeal any less deeply; rather, his way of coping was to embrace the light at the end of the tunnel with open arms and a heart ready to leap forward. Barry, watching Wally's enthusiastic display, couldn't help but let a wide grin spread across his face. \\"Looks like Wally's back, and then some,\\" he chuckled, his eyes following Wally as he danced around, roping others into his impromptu celebration. Dokko, ever the observer, noted, \\"It's like he's making up for all the quiet moments he had while we were fighting that corruption. I guess joy just can't be contained in him any longer.\\" Indeed, Wally's resurgence served as a beacon of hope for the group. His unrestrained happiness was contagious, reminding everyone that despite the darkness they had faced, there were still endless reasons to celebrate and find joy in their existence. \\"It's amazing, isn't it?\\" Wally said, pausing his celebrations for a moment as he looked around at his friends. \\"We went through all of that together, and here we are, standing strong. Let's never forget how powerful we are together.\\" As the evening progressed, Wally's fervor seemed to ignite a spark within the group. His rapid return to his usual self, supercharged with an almost tangible joy, acted as a catalyst, helping his friends begin to process their own experiences and start looking forward with hope rather than backward with fear. The story of Wally's instant transformation after the defeat of the corruption spread throughout Chamomile Valley, inspiring tales and songs about resilience, the power of positivity, and the indomitable spirit of friendship. Wally, in his own unique and unexpected way, reminded everyone that sometimes, the best response to darkness is to shine even brighter the moment it's banished. As Chamomile Valley healed and rebuilt, Wally's laughter continued to echo, a reminder that even after the greatest challenges, the human spirit—or in this case, the spirit of a remarkably resilient ram—could instantly find its way back to joy, leading the way for others to follow."},{"prompt":"Write about what happened to Krash","completion":"As the world of Chamomile Valley slowly began to mend from the corruption that had once threatened to consume it, tales of bravery, loss, and redemption weaved through the conversations of its inhabitants. Within this tapestry of stories, the tale of Krash the Rabbit stood out, a narrative that embodied the tumultuous journey from darkness back into light. Krash, known for his adventurous spirit and unyielding curiosity, had been among the first to encounter the corruption. His naive approach led him to a peril close to consuming him completely, transforming him into a vessel of the very darkness they all fought against. The memory of Krash, with his eyes devoid of the sparkle once so characteristic, haunted the residents of Chamomile Valley. They remembered how he had moved amongst them, a shadow of his former self, spreading the corruption he could not control. Yet, as the final battle waned and the corruption was defeated, so too was the hold it had over Krash. When the darkness receded, it left behind a valley scarred but intact, and a rabbit profoundly changed by his experience. The physical transformation reversed, but the ordeal left invisible marks on Krash that were not so easily erased. In the days following the end of corruption, Krash found himself grappling with a myriad of emotions. Guilt weighed heavily on him for the role he inadvertently played during the corruption’s spread. Fear lingered in the corners of his mind, a constant reminder of the darkness that had once consumed him. Yet, amidst these challenging emotions, a flicker of hope began to ignite within Krash’s heart. Krash’s journey to redemption was a slow and painstaking process. It was in the understanding and forgiveness of his friends—Wally, Barry, Dokko, Rosa, and Chiko—that Krash found the strength to forgive himself. They remained steadfast by his side, reminding him that he was more than his mistakes, more than the darkness that had once overshadowed his light. Determined to make amends, Krash threw himself into aiding the recovery of Chamomile Valley. He helped repair the damage done to their homes and lent his strength to those who were working to ensure that such a corruption could never take hold again. Most importantly, Krash worked to rebuild the trust that was strained during the ordeal. He opened up about his fears and guilt, sharing his vulnerabilities in a way he never had before. This honesty brought him closer to his friends, deepening their bonds through shared pain and mutual healing. Over time, Krash's vibrant energy and enthusiasm for life began to return, but they were now tempered with a wisdom and humility that spoke of his journey. He became a beacon of resilience within the community, inspiring others with his determination to move forward despite the shadows of the past. The story of Krash is one of transformation—of how a heart, once darkened, can find its way back to the light, not in spite of its scars, but because of them. It's a reminder that redemption lies within reach of all, even those who feel lost in the depths of their own mistakes. Krash's tale became a cherished part of Chamomile Valley's history, a testament to the power of friendship, forgiveness, and the unwavering strength of the spirit to overcome darkness."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, plausible alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter in the world of the alternate history scenario with absolutely no references fo real life, OTL or that this is even an alternate history timeline at all, in which the post-1912, pre-1928 and then post-1937, pre-1945 the stratocratic [military dominated] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary democratic republic of the First Republic of China as the unitary constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy of the Empire of China founded and ruled by Yuan Shikai in 1915 if it [the Empire of China] survived the National Protection War of 1915-1916 lead by Sun Yat Sen’s Nationalist China and the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, center to far right, Leninist Stalinist secret society/Revolutionary organisation of the Kuomingtang [Chinese Nationalist Party] due to Sun’s death during the war and Shikai dying during the National Protection War in this timeline, leading to the Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi]-based Nationalist China becoming a independent Cantonese Republic in all but name and the Empire of China remaining under an extended regency for a year or two after the National Protection War due to Yuan Shikai's eldest son, the half Korean Yuan Keding who [Keding] had [Keding] become Chinese Crown Prince under the combined era and regal name of Yuntai, [Yuntai] refusing to become Emperor of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline, that is until the goal of the 1911-1912 Xinhai Revolution fought [the Xinhai Revolution] by the Kuomingtang and the anti Manchu Han nationalist revolutionary group of the Tongmenghui against the Manchu dominated, Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Manchuria, [the Xinhai Revolution's goal of] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" in other words [Overthrow Qing and restore Ming] restoring the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government [the Ming dynasty] of a post-Qing Han China and so the surviving descendants of the Chinese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] are invited by the Beiyang Government's and thus the first Republic of China's and the Empire of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly, [the Zhu descendants being invited by the National Assembly] to reclaim their [the Zhu descendants'] rightful position as the rulers [the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China, which they [the Zhu descendants] reluctantly accept, [the Zhu descendants] seeing that the people of the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in Han China support them [the Zhu descendants] and the monarchy [the Ming dynasty].

Zhuolin's son, Zhang Xueliang, [Xueliang] is [Xueliang] sent to the restored Ming dynasty after Zhuolin's death in 1928.","completion":"# Chapter XVII: The Dawn of the East - Restoration and Alignment The Ming Restoration: An Epoch of Resilience In the tumultuous years following the National Protection War, the Empire of China, having withstood internal strife and external pressures, found itself at a historical crossroads. The conflict, igniting divisions within the fabric of the nation, had tragically claimed the lives of visionaries and rulers alike, leaving the Empire under the stewardship of a regency council following Yuan Shikai’s unexpected demise. This period of governance was marked by an intense search for stability and legitimacy, a quest that would culminate in an extraordinary revival of the past. The proposal to restore the Ming dynasty was met with a mixture of skepticism and awe across the nation. Critics argued the move was a mere political ploy by the Beiyang government to consolidate power, while supporters saw it as a divine opportunity to rectify centuries of historical injustices. The pivotal moment arrived when descendants of the Zhu family, living in obscurity and wary of the immense responsibilities that beckoned, accepted the call to ascend the Dragon Throne once more. The solemn ceremony, blending ancient rituals with the fervor of modern nationalist ideals, heralded the beginning of a new era. The restorative process was not merely symbolic; it ignited a comprehensive overhaul of the socio-political and economic landscape of China. Taking inspiration from the Meiji Restoration in Japan, the new Ming government embarked on ambitious reforms aimed at modernizing the military, revitalizing industry, and promoting education. The echoes of the Xinhai Revolution's dreams were realized in a manner that few could have predicted, transforming the nation into a formidable power on the global stage. The Manchurian Question and the Rise of the East The fate of Manchuria, the ancestral homeland of the Qing dynasty, remained a contentious issue during this era of transformation. The region, under the sway of the formidable Fengtian Clique led by the Old Marshal Zhang Zhuolin, had become a de facto protectorate of the Great Japanese Empire amidst the chaos of the National Protection War. This arrangement, while ensuring stability, was viewed with suspicion by many in China who feared Japanese expansionism. The strategic importance of Manchuria, rich in resources and a gateway to China’s heartland, could not be understated. The intervention of the Japanese, particularly through the Kwangtung Army's protection of the South Manchuria Railway, was a double-edged sword that facilitated the expulsion of the Fengtian Clique but also entrenched Japanese influence in the region. This delicate balance of power necessitated a pragmatic approach from the restored Ming government, which sought to navigate the geopolitical complexities with caution and foresight. The sudden death of Zhang Zhuolin in 1928, a turning point in the region’s history, allowed for a reevaluation of Manchuria’s status. His son, Zhang Xueliang, found himself at the crossroads of legacy and the future. His subsequent relocation to the Ming court symbolized a potential bridge between the aspirations of Manchuria and the overarching vision of the Ming restoration, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the long and intricate tapestry of Chinese history. Legacy of a Vision: Wang Jingwei and the Transformation of Nationalist Thought Amidst the resurgence of imperial glory, the figure of Wang Jingwei emerged as a voice of moderation and transformation within the nationalist movement. Once a disciple of Sun Yat-sen, Wang's divergence from the path of territorial nationalism towards a more inclusive vision of China's place in the modern world reshaped the political landscape. Wang, advocating for a synergistic blend of traditional values and socialist principles, represented the evolving nature of Chinese nationalism. His efforts to bridge the gap between the revolutionary zeal of the Kuomintang and the pragmatic governance of the Ming dynasty highlighted the complexities of forging national unity amidst diversity. In Wang's philosophy, the essence of the nation was not defined by its past glories or territorial ambitions but by its commitment to the welfare and dignity of its citizens. The story of Ming China’s resurgence, interwoven with the aspirations and struggles of its people, reflects the enduring quest for identity and sovereignty in a rapidly changing world. From the ashes of conflict and the depths of colonial ambition, a new vision of China emerged, one that balanced the weight of history with the imperatives of modernity. This chapter in China’s saga, a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its people, continues to inspire and challenge future generations on the path to realizing the great Chinese dream."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This component will allow you to slot in any content you want for each slide of the carousel. # Step 1: Setup Your Vue 3 Project If you haven't already, create a new Vue 3 project: \`\`\`bash npm install -g @vue/cli vue create my-vue-project cd my-vue-project \`\`\` Choose the default Vue 3 preset or configure it as you like. # Step 2: Create the Carousel Component Create a new file for your carousel component, let’s call it \`Carousel.vue\`, and save it in the \`src/components\` directory. \`\`\`html <!-- src/components/Carousel.vue --> <template> <div class=\\"carousel\\"> <button @click=\\"prev\\">Prev</button> <div class=\\"carousel-content\\"> <slot :active=\\"active\\"></slot> </div> <button @click=\\"next\\">Next</button> </div> </template> <script> export default { name: 'Carousel', data() { return { active: 0, }; }, methods: { next() { this.active = (this.active + 1) % this.slots.default().length; }, prev() { this.active = (this.active + this.slots.default().length - 1) % this.slots.default().length; }, }, }; <\/script> <style> .carousel-content { display: flex; overflow: hidden; } </style> \`\`\` # Step 3: Using the Carousel Component Now, let's use the \`Carousel\` component and slot in some items. You might want to create another component for the carousel items or you can directly use HTML elements. For simplicity, we’ll use \`div\` elements here. Open your \`App.vue\` or any component where you want to use the carousel and update it as follows: \`\`\`html <template> <Carousel> <template v-slot:default=\\"{ active }\\"> <div v-if=\\"active === 0\\">Slide 1 Content</div> <div v-if=\\"active === 1\\">Slide 2 Content</div> <div v-if=\\"active === 2\\">Slide 3 Content</div> </template> </Carousel> </template> <script> import Carousel from '@/components/Carousel.vue'; export default { name: 'App', components: { Carousel, }, }; <\/script> \`\`\` # Explanation - This carousel component works by showing/hiding slides based on the \`active\` index. - The \`next\` and \`prev\` button methods update the \`active\` index, and only the content with the matching index will be displayed. - By using a slot with a scoped property (\`active\`), the parent component (\`App.vue\`) can control which slide to show based on the \`active\` index. # Improvement For a better user experience and more features (like animations, touch support, dynamic slide addition/removal), you might consider using a library or framework dedicated to carousels, such as Vue Slick Carousel or Swiper, which are highly customizable and come with a rich set of features out of the box."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These levels require high precision, timing, and extensive practice to complete. The neural conditions or cognitive abilities that contribute to excelling in such difficulty levels encompass a diverse range of mental faculties. Here are several key factors: 1. **Quick Reflexes**: The ability to react swiftly to visual stimuli is paramount. These reflexes allow players to make split-second decisions, which are vital in navigating through the complex and fast-paced obstacles present in extreme demon levels. 2. **Memory**: Many extreme demon levels in \\"Geometry Dash\\" require memorization of sequences, as trial and error teach the player the correct path and timing. Good memory aids in retaining these sequences, reducing the number of attempts needed to clear the level. 3. **Pattern Recognition**: This cognitive ability enables players to recognize sequences and patterns quickly within the game's obstacles and mechanics. Pattern recognition assists in anticipating upcoming challenges, which is critical for planning jumps and maneuvers ahead of time. 4. **Hand-Eye Coordination**: The synchronization of visual information with motor control impacts a player's ability to navigate through levels accurately. Precise hand-eye coordination is essential for executing the rapid and complex sequences of actions required on extreme demon difficulty levels. 5. **Concentration and Focus**: Given the length and complexity of extreme demon levels, maintaining high levels of concentration and focus over extended periods is crucial. Players need to keep their attention from waning to avoid mistakes that could lead to failure. 6. **Stress Tolerance**: The ability to remain calm under pressure is vital. Extreme demon levels can be incredibly frustrating due to their difficulty, and managing stress and avoiding tilt is important for maintaining optimal performance. 7. **Persistence and Patience**: Given the high failure rates and steep learning curves associated with extreme demon levels, a player's willingness to persist through repeated attempts and learn from their mistakes is a key component of success. 8. **Motor Control and Precision**: The ability to execute precise movements, often requiring subtle adjustments, is crucial. This includes both tapping and holding actions with the right timing and intensity. 9. **Spatial Awareness**: Understanding and navigating the space within the game efficiently can help in predicting and reacting to obstacles more effectively. These abilities are not innate for most individuals but can be developed over time with practice. Hence, while a strong neural foundation is beneficial, the dedication to practice and improve is equally crucial in conquering extreme demon difficulty levels in \\"Geometry Dash.\\""},{"prompt":"Give name for neural condition","completion":"The various abilities required to excel at extreme difficulty levels in video games, like \\"Geometry Dash,\\" don't correspond to a single \\"neural condition\\" but rather a synergy of cognitive functions. Hence, there isn't a specific term that encompasses all these abilities as a single condition. Each ability—such as quick reflexes, memory retention, pattern recognition, hand-eye coordination, concentration and focus, stress tolerance, persistence, motor control, and spatial awareness—is rooted in different cognitive processes and areas of the brain. However, if we were to conceptualize a broader term that embodies the enhanced cognitive and neural capabilities beneficial for excelling in extremely challenging video games, you might consider it as having **\\"Optimized Cognitive-Motor Integration.\\"** This term broadly captures the efficient and effective integration of cognitive functions (like memory, attention, and pattern recognition) with motor skills (such as precision and coordination) that are critical for success in tasks requiring quick reflexes and complex, precise movements, characteristic of high-difficulty gaming. It’s also worth mentioning that these abilities fall under various domains: - **Cognitive flexibility** and **processing speed** relate to handling complex, rapidly changing environments. - **Executive functions**, a collection of cognitive processes that include working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control, which help manage and strategize the gameplay. - **Visuospatial skills** involve the ability to understand and navigate the spatial relationships among objects, crucial for predicting and reacting to the game's geometry. Again, there's no singular \\"neural condition\\" that embodies excellence in gaming; it’s more about how various cognitive and sensory-motor skills are sharpened and integrated through practice and play. As with many high-skill activities, a combination of innate ability and dedicated practice are key to reaching high levels of performance."},{"prompt":"I'm working on a comic book and I'd like to tell you about its premise.","completion":"That sounds exciting!

They're like a military version of the Teen Titans. Their HQ is every basement or attic of their homes. Villains include: British dude who mind-controls people to say the British version of a specific word (like biscuits instead of cookies or colour instead of color), some of their bullies from school, Dr. Mechanical Eye etc.","completion":"Your comic book concept sounds fascinating and fun! Mixing the relatable setting of basements and attics as HQs with the larger-than-life aspect of superhero action gives it a grounded yet adventurous feel, which could draw readers in. The age of the protagonists at 18 and 19 is perfect for exploring themes of independence, identity, and the transition into adulthood, all while they're engaged in superhero activities. The villain concepts you’ve mentioned add a unique and humorous twist, which can help to set your comic apart. The British villain who mind-controls people to say the British version of words is especially intriguing and funny, promising some light-hearted moments amidst potentially tense scenarios. Including their school bullies as villains is a great touch, as it adds personal stakes for the characters and can explore themes of overcoming past traumas and adversaries. Dr. Mechanical Eye hints at more traditional superhero showdowns, providing a nice balance of threats for your heroes to face. Here are a few suggestions to consider: 1. Character Development: Give each of your four main characters distinct personalities, backgrounds, and motivations for being heroes, which will help readers connect with them on a personal level. 2. Powers and Limitations: Define what makes your teen heroes special - their powers, skills, or technologies. Equally important are their limitations or vulnerabilities, which add tension and realism to their battles and growth. 3. Themes and Conflicts: Beyond the external conflicts with villains, explore internal conflicts within the team and personal lives of the heroes. Themes like friendship, sacrifice, and the pressure of expectations can add depth to your story. 4. World-Building: Even with the comic grounded in everyday settings, consider how the existence of superheroes and villains has affected the society in your story. This can add an interesting layer to your narrative. 5. Humor and Tone: Balancing humor with action and drama can be challenging but rewarding. Ensure that the comic tone resonates with your intended audience and complements your storytelling style. Your comic book idea has a lot of potentials, and it seems like it will offer a mix of action, humor, and character-driven storytelling. Keep developing your characters, their world, and the dynamics between them, and you could have a compelling series on your hands. Good luck with your project!"},{"prompt":"Dr. Mechanical Eye wears a helmet with a yellow eye. He wears that helmet because he has poor eyesight that is sensitive to sunlight. He wears a labcoat and his helmet is made out of metal. His yellow eye has the power of sun, aka a death-ray that hurts when used.

His poor eyesight and sensitivity to sunlight humanize him, providing a backstory that explains his motives and perhaps even elicits sympathy from readers. It's a clever twist that his helmet, while a tool to aid his vision, doubles as a powerful weapon with a sun-based death-ray. This duality makes for a complex character who can play both the antagonist and, circumstantially, an ally to your protagonists. The plot twist where Dr. Mechanical Eye teams up with the main characters against a common foe is a fantastic narrative choice. It allows for character development and adds layers to the storyline, showing that the world isn't simply divided into good and evil. Here are a few ideas on how to expand on this alliance: 1. **Reluctant Allies**: The initial distrust and tension between the friends and Dr. Mechanical Eye could provide rich character interactions. Showcasing their gradual shift from adversaries to uneasy allies adds drama and depth to their relationships. 2. **Shared Goals**: Highlight what brings them together to fight the common enemy. Is there something specific at stake that requires them to join forces, or is it a matter of survival? This shared goal can reveal more about each character's values and priorities. 3. **Character Dynamics**: Use this temporary alliance to explore different dynamics within the group. Perhaps one of the friends is more willing to trust Dr. Mechanical Eye, causing friction within the team. Alternatively, Dr. Mechanical Eye might develop a respect or fondness for one or more of the heroes, complicating his role as a villain in future confrontations. 4. **Skill and Resource Sharing**: The heroes and Dr. Mechanical Eye might need to share knowledge, skills, or technology to overcome their common enemy. This could lead to interesting scenarios where characters have to teach or learn from one another, showcasing their strengths and vulnerabilities. 5. **Moral Ambiguity**: Use this alliance to delve into themes of morality, redemption, and the complexity of character. This situation provides a fertile ground for characters, including Dr. Mechanical Eye, to reflect on their actions and maybe evolve personally. 6. **Aftermath and Future Implications**: Consider the long-term implications of this alliance. How does this temporary partnership affect the characters' relationships going forward? This could lead to interesting story arcs, such as a redemption arc for Dr. Mechanical Eye, ongoing alliances against greater threats, or even betrayals. By having Dr. Mechanical Eye collaborate with your protagonists, you're setting the stage for a richly layered narrative that goes beyond the typical hero-villain dichotomy. This not only adds depth to your story but also provides opportunities to explore themes of empathy, redemption, and the complexity of human (or superhero) nature. Your comic book is shaping up to be a compelling tale of adventure and emotional depth."},{"prompt":"Our 4 main characters' names are Danny, Max, Ryan and Kevin. Max is the leader of the group, Danny is the intelligent one, Kevin is the stealthiest and Ryan is the bruiser of the group, as in his own words, watched every Rocky movie.","completion":"Danny, Max, Ryan, and Kevin – each with their own unique roles within the group – set the stage for diverse narratives and interactions, creating a dynamic team that readers can get behind. Their distinct skill sets and personalities not only make them a well-rounded team but also offer ample opportunity for character development and exploration. Here's a brief expansion on each character's role and potential story arcs: # Max, The Leader - **Character Arc**: As the leader, Max's challenges could involve making difficult decisions, dealing with the pressure of responsibility, and learning the true meaning of leadership beyond just giving orders. His leadership style and decisions could sometimes be questioned by the team, pushing him to grow and adapt. - **Interactions**: Max’s interactions with the team would be pivotal. His ability to motivate and maintain the unity of the group, even in dire situations, would be key to their success. # Danny, The Intelligent One - **Character Arc**: Danny could face challenges that test his intellect beyond book smarts, such as ethical dilemmas or scenarios where emotional intelligence is required. There's potential for a plot where his knowledge puts the group in jeopardy, forcing him to learn humility. - **Interactions**: Danny would be the go-to for plans and strategies. His interactions might involve explaining complex ideas in layman's terms or sometimes even clashing with Max over the best course of action, adding depth to their relationship. # Kevin, The Stealthiest - **Character Arc**: Kevin’s storyline could explore themes of invisibility versus recognition. Being the stealthy one, he might struggle with feeling underappreciated or overshadowed by the more upfront members of the team. A solo mission could prove his worth or teach him the value of working from the shadows. - **Interactions**: Kevin’s unique skills make him invaluable for reconnaissance and surprise attacks. His stealth could also be a metaphor for feeling unnoticed, which could lead to interesting personal growth. # Ryan, The Bruiser - **Character Arc**: Ryan’s love for Rocky movies and his role as the bruiser suggest a plotline around physical strength versus emotional strength. Challenges for him could involve facing a situation where brute force isn't the answer, teaching him the importance of gentleness and strategy. - **Interactions**: Ryan is likely the muscle of the group but also its heart. His bravery and straightforwardness could inspire his friends when morale is low, yet his approach might sometimes require tempering by the more strategic team members. # Collective Dynamics and Development: Your team's diverse makeup is ripe for exploring various themes, such as the value of different perspectives, the balance between brain and brawn, leadership and camaraderie, and the evolution of friendship under pressure. Featuring episodes where the team's dynamics are shaken up – such as a mission where Ryan has to be the stealthy one, or Kevin takes the lead – can offer refreshing takes on their characters and growth. Additionally, their collective response to threats, especially nuanced ones like Dr. Mechanical Eye, can test and ultimately strengthen their bond, showcasing that true heroism lies in unity and the willingness to grow, both as individuals and as a team.

Ryan has boxing tape and a red bandana. He wears a hoodie over a tank-top and jeans.","completion":"The detailed descriptions of your characters' appearances and outfits offer a vivid image of each individual's personality and role within the team. Their chosen attire not only speaks to their personal tastes but also to their functionality within the group and the tasks they are most likely suited to perform. Here's how their looks could reflect their personalities and roles in the story: # Kevin With his Sam Fisher-style night vision goggles and a tight wetsuit paired with combat boots, Kevin embodies the role of the stealth operative perfectly. His outfit suggests a character who is agile, prepared for quick, silent movements, and adept at gathering information without being detected. The choice of night vision goggles indicates he's often involved in nocturnal operations or in dark environments where seeing the unseen is crucial. # Max Max’s choice of a brown hoodie, orange goggles, and an American flag bandana wrapped around his mouth paints a picture of an inventive and perhaps patriotic leader. The casual yet practical hoodie can blend in urban environments, while the goggles suggest readiness for action or a need to protect against environmental factors. The bandana is both a stylistic choice and possibly a symbol of his values or motivations. As the leader, his look balances approachability with a readiness for combat. # Danny Danny's attire, including a brodie helmet with goggles, face paint, and a field jacket with ripped sleeves, coupled with carrying a skateboard, evokes a sense of a rugged, ready-for-anything tactician who also embraces a bit of rebellion. The helmet and field jacket suggest a nod to traditional military gear, reflecting his strategic mind and perhaps an interest in historical battles or tactics. The skateboard adds a youthful, agile element, indicating he can quickly maneuver in and out of situations, both physically and mentally. # Ryan Outfitted in boxing tape, a red bandana, hoodie over a tank-top, and jeans, Ryan’s appearance screams street brawler with a heart. The boxing tape and red bandana are direct nods to his fighting style—upfront and personal, and possibly a homage to his love for Rocky movies. The casual combination of a hoodie and tank-top underneath allows for mobility and suggests a laid-back attitude outside of combat. His attire makes him approachable and relatable, a solid foundation for the \\"bruiser\\" of the group. # Overall Team Aesthetic Your team's aesthetic nicely balances individual personality with team unity. Each member’s attire reflects their specific role and skills while also fitting into a cohesive group of young, unconventional heroes. This dynamic visual representation strengthens your characters' identities and makes them memorable to the audience. As the story progresses, you could explore deeper into how their outfits evolve with their characters—whether they add new elements to their attire as a symbol of growth or change looks entirely to reflect major turning points in the narrative. In crafting your comic, the visual design of your characters is just as crucial as their written personalities and backstories. These thoughtful details in their attire will help readers quickly identify and grow attached to each member of the team, adding layers of depth to your storytelling through visual cues."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Русская жизнь показана во всей ее красе. Интершум помогает нам прочувствовать жизнь в Оренбургской деревне, послушать петушиные песни утром или наблюдать, как коровки пасутся на лугу. Музыкальное сопровождение не навязчивое, помогает нам проникнуться историями и в конце даже проронить слезу, мы часто можем услышать русские мотивы, откликающиеся в сердцах каждого. 2.Владимир,создает абстрактные произведения, отличающиеся уникальным видением искусства, что становится основным конфликтом между двумя творцами, так как им трудно понять друг друга. «щас я из тебя всю абстракцию выгоню», - шутливо говорит один из них. Саша, с другой стороны, более камерный и лиричный художник. Он рисует жизнь какой она есть, тут сталкиваются мир реализма и абстракции столкнулись воедино. 3.Музыкальное сопровождение, звучащее при показе работ Володи Бурова, создает ощущение страдания и тревоги. Александра всегда изображают на фоне светлых и живописных просторов, в то время как Володю чаще показывают в темных и немного мрачных сценах из-за его предпочтения рисовать дома. Лайфы показывают нам жизнь Владимира и Александара, поход в баню, деревенскую дискотеку. Как живут обычные люди создавая такие необычные картины. Каждый кадр олицетворяет их быт и обширную русскую душу. Беря интервью мы можем полностью узнать позицию каждого героя и проникнуться их жизнью. Мы видим как один из героев не верит что видит Эльфивую башню не верит своим глаза, а второй относится к этому равнодушно. Одно событие, а какой разный взгляд на мир.","completion":"1. В документальном фильме \\"Буров и Буров\\" цветопередача умиротворяет и навевает чувство естественности, приглашая зрителя окунуться в аутентичную красоту российской жизни. Звуковая кулиса вносит свой вклад, позволяя на мгновение почувствовать себя частью Оренбургской деревни, будь то утренние крики петуха или вид загоняемых на пастбище коров. Мелодии, переплетенные с кадрами, подчеркивают глубину переживаний персонажей, зачастую двигая нас к сопереживанию и слезам, с русскими народными мотивами, отзывающимися в душе каждого зрителя. 2. Втягивая нас в кинематографичную спираль их отношений, Владимир занимается созданием абстрактных работ, поднимая перед зрителем великолепие собственного, уникального видения мира искусства, что является краеугольным камнем их творческого диссонанса. \\"Сейчас я из тебя всю абстракцию выгоню\\", - в шутку бросает один из них, подчеркивая ироничное противостояние между ними. Саша, напротив, предпочитает более интимный и поэтический подход к живописи, отражая мир таким, каким его видит, что приводит к захватывающему соперничеству между реализмом и абстракционизмом в их творчестве. 3. Музыкальное сопровождение фильма резонирует с атмосферой, представленной в работах Владимира Бурова, обрамляя его искусство ореолом печали и беспокойства. В то же время, сцены с Александром окутаны светом и живописью, создавая контраст между их художественными мирами. Различные моменты из жизни персонажей, от посещения бани до деревенских вечеринок, раскрывают зрителю целостность их существования в процессе создания неповторимого искусства. Интервью с главными героями позволяет глубже понять их взгляды и переживания, подчеркивая различие восприятия одних и тех же событий, как, например, их разные реакции на вид Эйфелевой башни, что раскрывает их уникальные взгляды на мир."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It focuses on how widely and effectively a message is disseminated across potential consumers. Understanding the reach effect is crucial for businesses and marketers because it helps gauge the effectiveness of their communication strategies, advertising campaigns, or social media efforts in terms of audience size and demographic spread. # Key Components of Reach Effect 1. **Audience Size:** Essentially, this indicates the number of unique individuals who are exposed to a message within a specific period. A larger audience size generally suggests a higher potential for message dissemination. 2. **Geographic Distribution:** This refers to the geographical areas covered by the campaign. A wide geographic distribution can result in a diverse audience, which might be beneficial for campaigns aiming for a national or global reach. 3. **Demographic Spread:** Understand the demographic characteristics (age, gender, income, interests, etc.) of the audience that the message reaches. An effective campaign should ideally reach its target demographic accurately. 4. **Mediums and Channels:** The mediums (digital, print, broadcast, etc.) and channels (social media, TV, websites, etc.) used can dramatically affect the reach. Different channels have varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the target audience. # Impact of Reach Effect - **Brand Awareness:** Increased reach typically leads to higher brand awareness as more people are introduced to the brand or reminded of it. - **Engagement:** Although reach is primarily about the size of the audience, a broader reach can indirectly lead to increased engagement through reactions, comments, shares, etc., especially on social media platforms. - **Market Expansion:** By reaching a broader and varied audience, businesses can explore new market segments or consolidate their position in existing ones. # Measurement of Reach - **Analytics and Metrics:** Modern digital marketing offers precise tools for measuring reach, including views, impressions, unique visitors, etc. - **Surveys and Market Research:** These can provide insights into brand awareness and the effectiveness of different channels in reaching target audiences. - **Engagement Rates:** While primarily a measure of interaction, they can also offer insights into how well the content reached and resonated with the audience. # Challenges While the primary goal is to maximize reach, it's important to balance quantity with quality. Reaching a vast, irrelevant audience can be less effective than targeting a smaller, more relevant group. Additionally, in the digital age, consumers are bombarded with information, making it a challenge for messages to cut through the noise. The reach effect plays a critical role in designing and adjusting marketing strategies to maximize visibility, engagement, and ultimately, the desired action from the target audience."},{"prompt":"Как составить медиаплан","completion":"Составление медиаплана – это ключевой этап в подготовке любой рекламной кампании, который помогает оптимизировать расходы и повысить эффективность размещения рекламы.

The process involves several key steps, from selecting an appropriate airfoil to simulating the performance using QBlade software. Here's a structured approach to tackle your project: # 1. Understanding Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) First, get a solid understanding of VAWTs, including their advantages, challenges, and typical use cases. Unlike horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs), VAWTs are less sensitive to the direction of the wind, which can be advantageous in environments where wind direction frequently changes. # 2. Airfoil Selection For a VAWT, the choice of airfoil is crucial. You're aiming for an airfoil that offers the highest glide ratio at a wind velocity of 5 meters per second. This is because a higher lift-to-drag ratio (glide ratio) typically translates to better turbine performance at the specified wind speed. Steps for Airfoil Selection: - **Research Airfoils**: Explore existing airfoils used in VAWTs. Some airfoils designed for low Reynolds number operations, such as the NACA 0018 or the NACA 0021, might be good starting points given the turbine size and operational wind speed you mentioned. - **Evaluate Airfoil Performance**: Look into the lift and drag coefficients (Cl and Cd) for potential airfoils at your target wind speed. The lift-to-drag ratio is a primary indicator of airfoil performance for your application. - **Simulation Tools**: Before final selection, use airfoil analysis tools like XFOIL (incorporated within QBlade) to simulate performance specifically at a 5 m/s wind velocity and for a Reynolds number appropriate for a 1-meter blade length. # 3. QBlade Simulation Once you have selected your airfoil, the next step is to simulate the whole turbine using QBlade. QBlade is an excellent tool for performing both aerodynamic and performance simulations of wind turbines. Steps for QBlade Simulation: - **Geometry Setup**: Define the geometry of your VAWT in QBlade, including blade number, blade length (1 meter, as mentioned), and the selected airfoil shape. - **Operational Conditions**: Set the operational parameters such as wind velocity (5 m/s) and any relevant environmental conditions. - **Simulation and Optimization**: Run simulations to analyze the performance. You might need to iterate on blade design, pitch angle, or other parameters based on initial results to optimize performance. - **Analysis and Report Generation**: Collect simulation outputs such as power coefficient (Cp), torque, and any other relevant data points for your report. # 4. Reporting When writing your report, ensure to: - **Introduce VAWTs**: Brief overview, significance, and why you chose a VAWT for your project. - **Discuss Airfoil Selection Process**: Criteria, options considered, and rationale for the final choice. - **Explain Simulation Methodology**: How you configured QBlade, parameters used, and why. - **Present and Analyze Results**: Include figures and tables that show your findings. Compare your results with theoretical expectations or results from similar studies. - **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summarize key findings and suggest areas for future research or development. # 5. Figures and Data Presentation - **Graphical Representations**: Use charts and graphs to illustrate performance characteristics such as lift-to-drag ratios, power output curves, and efficiency across varying wind speeds. - **Data Tables**: Present detailed numerical findings in tables for clear, at-a-glance communication of results. - **Software Screenshots**: Include screenshots from QBlade that show your turbine model, simulation setup, and results. - **Visualization**: If possible, incorporate flow visualization or animation that shows how air moves around your VAWT blades at different wind speeds. Following these steps should provide a robust structure to your project, ensuring a comprehensive treatment of VAWT design and performance analysis using QBlade. Good luck with your graduation project!"},{"prompt":"write me the report itself","completion":"Given the complexity and specificity of your request, without access to actual simulation data or specific outcomes, I will provide a template for a graduation project report on the design and analysis of a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) using QBlade.

Приведите полное решение.","completion":"Давайте разберемся, что происходит при выполнении каждой команды из программы 12211: 1) При выполнении команды 1 (прибавить 3) получаем: 1 + 3 = 4 2) При выполнении команды 2 (умножить на b) получаем: 4 * b = 4b 3) При выполнении команды 2 (умножить на b) второй раз получаем: 4b * b = 4b^2 4) При выполнении команды 1 (прибавить 3) второй раз получаем: 4b^2 + 3 Таким образом, программа превратила число 1 в число 150: 4b^2 + 3 = 150 Решим уравнение: 4b^2 = 150 - 3 4b^2 = 147 b^2 = 36 b = 6 Ответ: значение b равно 6."}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},W={key:1};function L(o,e,l,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(i(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",q,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
