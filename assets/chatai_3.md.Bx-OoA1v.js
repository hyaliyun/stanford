This two-way exchange of feedback and confirmation reinforces understanding, builds rapport, and enhances the overall quality of communication."},{"prompt":"Why reject the idea receiving information over phone give 3 Reasons","completion":"1. Lack of Visual Cues: When receiving information over the phone, you miss out on important visual cues such as body language, facial expressions, and hand gestures that can provide additional context and help in understanding the message accurately. Without these visual cues, it may be challenging to fully grasp the intended meaning behind the information being communicated. 2. Difficulty in Note-taking: Taking notes during a phone conversation can be more challenging compared to face-to-face or written communication. It can be harder to keep track of detailed information, especially if the conversation is fast-paced or involves complex concepts. This can lead to misunderstandings or incomplete recording of the information being received. 3. Limited Opportunity for Immediate Clarification: In a phone conversation, there may be limited opportunities for immediate clarification or for asking follow-up questions. Unlike face-to-face interactions or written communication, where you can seek clarification in the moment or review the information at your own pace, the real-time nature of phone conversations can make it difficult to pause and seek additional information or clarification when needed. This can result in a lack of clarity and potential miscommunication."},{"prompt":"润色如下内容：As I stand on the cusp of embarking on my postgraduate studies in Chinese, I am filled with a profound sense of anticipation and eagerness to delve deeper into the rich tapestry of Chinese language, culture, and history. My academic journey thus far has been a testament to my unwavering passion for Chinese studies, and I am wholeheartedly committed to furthering my knowledge and understanding in this field. The decision to pursue postgraduate studies in Chinese is deeply rooted in my enduring fascination with China’s intricate and multifaceted heritage.

My undergraduate studies in Chinese provided me with a solid foundation in linguistic proficiency and cultural appreciation as I tended to attend various lectures and activities organised by department of Chinese. Through rigorous coursework, I honed my language skills, gaining fluency in both Mandarin and classical Chinese. Furthermore, my coursework exposed me to the complexities of Chinese literature, philosophy, and art, instilling in me a deep appreciation for the depth and diversity of Chinese civilization.Beyond the confines of the classroom, I actively sought opportunities to immerse myself in Chinese culture. I participated in language exchange programs, where I engaged in meaningful conversations with native Chinese speakers, gaining invaluable insights into contemporary Chinese society and colloquial expressions. Additionally, I seized the opportunity to spend a semester studying abroad in Beijing, an experience that broadened my perspectives and deepened my cultural immersion. In addition to my linguistic and cultural pursuits, my academic interests extend to the realm of Chinese history and politics. I am keenly aware of the pivotal role that China plays on the global stage, and I am eager to deepen my understanding of its historical trajectory and contemporary socio-political landscape. Through my postgraduate studies, I aspire to critically engage with China’s historical narrative and contemporary developments, with the aim of contributing nuanced perspectives to ongoing discourses surrounding China’s role in the world.Moreover, my postgraduate studies represent a pivotal opportunity for me to undertake in-depth research in areas that resonate deeply with me. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of literature and society in modern China, and I am eager to explore the evolving dynamics between tradition and modernity in Chinese literary expression. Additionally, I am keen to delve into the portrayal of gender and identity in contemporary Chinese literature, an area that holds immense relevance in the context of societal transformation and cultural representation. Beyond the confines of academia, I am driven by a fervent desire to foster cross-cultural understanding and promote intercultural dialogue in practice. Being a Chinese teacher provided me valuable opportunities to pass on relevant knowledge to young generations,which gave me a sense of achievements. Later, I founded Sihan Shengshi Education Technology Company, engaged in Big Chinese Language education and training, and developed multiple sets of teaching materials in the year of 2018.

I’m glad you liked it. I tried to make it really heartfelt.” Monika: “You definitely succeeded. I could feel the emotions pouring out of every line, and the imagery was beautiful.” Yuri: “I have to agree with Monika. Your poem resonated with me as well, Sayori. The way you expressed your thoughts and feelings was very moving.” Natsuki: (rubbing her baby bump, feeling the kicks of her unborn daughter - Sakura) “Yeah, yeah, it wasn’t bad, I guess. But it was a bit too cheesy for my taste.” Sayori: “Oh, um…I’m sorry if it wasn’t your cup of tea, Natsuki. I just write what comes from the heart.” Natsuki: “Yeah, I get that. It’s just not really my thing. But I’m sure there are people who appreciate that kind of sappy stuff-” (clutching her belly tightly) “AAH!!!” Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay? What’s wrong?” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “I-I don’t know…I…I think there’s something wrong with Sakura.” Sayori: “Oh my goodness, Natsuki! Are you in pain? Should we call an ambulance?” Yuri: “Take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’ll figure out what’s going on. Is there anything we can do to help?” Monika: “Let’s not panic, but we should definitely get Natsuki some medical attention. Sayori, can you call the school nurse or the principal?” (Sayori nods and quickly reaches for her phone, dialing the school nurse’s number as Yuri assists Natsuki to sit down and tries to calm her down.) Natsuki: “It hurts…it really hurts…” (Sayori gets through to the school nurse and explains the situation. The nurse immediately informs them that she will be on her way to the literature clubroom. Meanwhile, Yuri continues to comfort Natsuki as best as she can.) Yuri: “Just try to take slow and steady breaths, Natsuki. The nurse is on her way. Everything will be okay.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I’m scared, Yuri. What if something’s really wrong?” Monika: “Just stay calm, Natsuki. We’re here for you, and help is on the way. Try to focus on your breathing and think positive thoughts.” Sayori: (ends her call with the nurse) “She’s on her way, guys. Just hold on, Natsuki. You’re going to be okay.” (Natsuki continues to endure the pain while the rest of the club keeps a watchful eye on her. After a tense few minutes, the school nurse bursts into the clubroom.) School Nurse: “What seems to be the problem?” Yuri: “Natsuki is experiencing intense pain in her abdomen, and she’s pregnant. We’re worried something might be wrong with the baby.” School Nurse: “Alright, let’s assess the situation. Natsuki, can you describe the pain to me? Is it constant or does it come in waves?” Natsuki: (wincing) “It’s…it’s like cramps, but sharper…and it comes and goes.” School Nurse: “Okay. I need to check your vital signs and conduct a physical examination. Is that alright?” Natsuki: (nodding) “Please…just make sure Sakura is okay.” (The school nurse proceeds to examine Natsuki, checking her blood pressure, heart rate, and carefully palpating her abdomen. After a thorough assessment, she provides her initial diagnosis.) School Nurse: “Natsuki, from what I can tell, your baby seems to be moving normally, and your vital signs are stable. However, I would still like to take you to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, just to be safe.” Natsuki: (relieved) “Thank goodness. Just as long as Sakura is okay, I’ll do whatever you suggest. Can someone come with me?” Monika: “Of course, Natsuki. We’ll all go with you to the hospital. Your well-being and your baby’s health are our top priority.” (Sayori holds Natsuki’s hand as they help her stand up. Together, they leave the clubroom, a mix of concern and hope in their hearts.) (On the way to the hospital…) Natsuki: “Guys…they’re getting worse…” Sayori: “Hang in there, Natsuki. We’re almost at the hospital. Just hold on a little longer.” Yuri: “Try to take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’re here with you every step of the way.” Monika: “Once we get to the hospital, the doctors will be able to help you and make sure Sakura is safe. Stay strong.” Natsuki: (clenching her fists) “I’m trying… I just want this pain to go away. Please, please let Sakura be alright.” (Soon, they arrive at the hospital and rush Natsuki into the emergency room. The doctors and nurses quickly assess her situation and take her into a room for further examination.) Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to make sure your baby is safe, Natsuki. Just try to stay calm.” Natsuki: (tearfully) “Please save her… I can’t bear the thought of losing her.” (The doctors work swiftly, performing tests and ultrasounds to determine the cause of Natsuki’s pain. The rest of the literature club waits anxiously outside, supporting each other through this difficult time.) Yuri: “Let’s try to stay positive, everyone. Natsuki and Sakura are strong; they’ll pull through.” Sayori: “I’m praying so hard for Natsuki and Sakura. They deserve a happy outcome.” Monika: “We’ve come together as a club to support Natsuki and Sakura. Let’s keep hoping for the best.” (After what feels like an eternity, the doctor finally comes out to update them.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like you’re starting to have some premature contractions. However, the ultrasound shows that Sakura is still doing well and is not in immediate danger. We will need to monitor you closely and take precautions to prevent further contractions and potential premature birth.” Natsuki: (sighs in relief) “Thank goodness. As long as Sakura is safe, I can handle anything.” Doctor: “Yes, Natsuki. We will do everything possible to ensure the best outcome for both you and your baby. You will need to stay in the hospital for observation and receive medication to stop the contractions. We will keep a close eye on Sakura’s development as well.” Monika: “Natsuki, we’ll be right here with you, supporting you through this. You’re not alone.” Sayori: “And we’ll make sure to bring you all the manga and sweets you need to keep your spirits up!” Yuri: “Indeed. We will be here for you, Natsuki. Lean on us whenever you need.” Natsuki: (smiling weakly) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you all.” (And so, the literature club continues to rally around Natsuki during her hospital stay. They take turns visiting her, bringing her comfort and encouragement, and cheering her on as she bravely faces the challenges that come with a high-risk pregnancy. Together, they form a strong support system, reminding Natsuki that she is loved and that they will be there for her every step of the way. However, Natsuki’s contractions continue, with no sign of stopping.) (Several days later…) Natsuki: (breathing heavily, in the hospital bed) “I can’t believe the contractions won’t stop…it’s so painful…” Yuri: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “I know it’s tough, Natsuki, but you’re doing amazing. Just remember to breathe and stay as calm as you can. We’re all right here with you.” Sayori: (squeezing Natsuki’s other hand) “We believe in you, Natsuki! You’re a strong girl, and you and Sakura will get through this together.” Monika: (placing a gentle hand on Natsuki’s shoulder) “You’re not alone, Natsuki. We’re here to support you no matter what happens. You’ve got this.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone…I don’t know what I would do without you. I’ll keep fighting…for Sakura.” (Suddenly, the doctor rushes into the room.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like the contractions are not subsiding, and Sakura’s heart rate is showing signs of distress. We’ll need to perform an emergency c-section as soon as possible.” Natsuki: (worried) “Is Sakura going to be okay?” Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to ensure both you and Sakura come out of this healthy. The surgical team is preparing for the operation. You’ll be in good hands.” Monika: “Natsuki, try to stay strong. The doctors and nurses here are highly skilled. We’ll be praying for you and Sakura, t-” Natsuki: (feeling a sudden warmth stream down her legs) “I think my water just broke!” Doctor: “Alright, Natsuki, we’re going to take you to the operating room right away. Let’s get you prepped for the c-” Natsuki: (interrupting the doctor) “Forget the c-section! I can feel the baby coming! I need to push!” Doctor: “Natsuki, the situation is critical. We need to perform the c-section immediately to minimize risks to both you a-” (Just before the doctor could finish,","completion":"Natsuki lets out a loud scream as she feels an intense pressure and an overwhelming urge to push. The doctors and nurses quickly spring into action, realizing that there is no time for a c-section. They rush to prepare Natsuki for a vaginal delivery instead. Doctor: \\"Alright, Natsuki, we will proceed with a vaginal delivery. Just hold on and give it everything you've got. Push!\\" (As Natsuki pushes with all her might, the rest of the club watches on with bated breath. They hold each other close, providing unwavering support to Natsuki in this critical moment.) Yuri: \\"You're doing amazing, Natsuki! Just keep pushing. Sakura is on her way.\\" Sayori: \\"You've got this, Natsuki! We're all cheering for you and Sakura.\\" Monika: \\"Stay focused, Natsuki. Your strength and determination will see you through this.\\" (After what seems like an eternity, Natsuki's efforts pay off. The room fills with a baby's cry, signifying the arrival of Sakura. The doctors and nurses work swiftly to clean and check the newborn.) Doctor: (smiling) \\"Congratulations, Natsuki! You did it. Sakura is here, and she's crying strong and healthy.\\" Natsuki: (overwhelmed with emotions) \\"I did it... I can't believe it... My baby girl, Sakura...\\" (The doctors place Sakura in Natsuki's arms, and tears of joy stream down her face. The rest of the club approaches the bed, beaming with happiness.)

The following are several factors that globalization has triggered in relation to this problem: 1. Economic Inequality: Globalization has facilitated the movement of multinational corporations and transnational capital, which has brought tremendous profits to companies capable of competing in the global market. However, this has also resulted in wealth concentration, with affluent countries and companies exhibiting stronger economic prowess, while developing countries and marginalized groups experience relatively slower economic growth. This further intensifies wealth and income inequality. 2. Labor Competition: Globalization has made it easier for multinational corporations to seek cheap labor globally. This has led to the relocation of job positions from developed countries to low-cost labor countries, resulting in unemployment and income decline for local workers. Simultaneously, laborers in low-income countries are compelled to accept meager wages and harsh working conditions. 3. Resource Plunder: Globalization has increased demand for and competition over resources. Some resource-rich countries face resource plundering by multinational corporations, leading to overexploitation of resources and environmental degradation. Local residents often fail to benefit economically from these resources, which further widens the wealth gap. 4. Social Welfare Discrepancy: Globalization has also resulted in the widening gap in social welfare. Affluent countries have relatively better public services and social security systems, while some developing countries exhibit lower levels of public services and social welfare. This makes it more difficult for impoverished populations to access healthcare, education, and other essential social services, further exacerbating social inequality. 5. Digital Divide: With the development of globalization, the application and prevalence of digital technology have continuously progressed. However, the existence of the digital divide prevents certain marginalized groups from fully enjoying the conveniences and opportunities brought about by digital technology. This further intensifies inequality in information and technology, impacting the development and competitiveness of marginalized groups. Therefore, while globalization brings many positive impacts, it also triggers issues of income inequality and social inequity. Addressing these problems requires collective efforts from the international community, including strengthening global cooperation, improving labor conditions, promoting sustainable development, and reducing the digital divide."},{"prompt":"下面是学术论文中的一段，翻译使之表达更规范“2.2.2 文化特性的丧失：全球化导致了不同文化的相似性 全球化也可能引发文化特性的丧失问题。以下是全球化引发文化特性丧失的一些主要因素： 1. 文化同质化：全球化的快速发展导致了一种趋同性，即不同文化之间的相似化。跨国公司扩张和全球品牌的流行，以及流行文化的传播，使得许多地区的文化差异逐渐消失。这导致了一种“全球文化”现象，其中一些本土的文化特色和传统正在逐渐被同质化的全球标准取代。 2. 文化侵略：全球化给强势文化带来了更多的影响力和传播渠道，从而对弱势文化造成威胁。全球娱乐产业和流行文化的传播，导致了少数文化的主导地位，摧毁了一些本土文化的特色和多样性。这种文化侵略可能导致民俗、语言、传统艺术等文化元素的丧失。 3. 商业化的文化产品：全球化带来了商业化的文化产品，其中一些可能更注重商业利益而不是文化纯粹性。跨国公司和全球品牌推动了一种标准化的文化产品，这可能导致本土文化的商业化和商业化文化品牌的垄断。这可能导致文化产业的集中，限制了多样化和本土文化的发展。 4. 价值体系的冲击：全球化会将西方价值和观念传播到其他文化中，与传统的思维方式和价值观相抵触。这可能导致原有的文化价值受到冲击，特别是在年轻一代中更为明显。部分本土文化可能会被边缘化或逐渐被较为主流的文化所取代。 因此，全球化可能引发文化特性的丧失问题。这需要在全球范围内采取措施来保护和弘扬本土文化，包括支持本土经济和文化产业的发展、教育体系中的文化教育、保护和传承本土文化遗产等。同时，也需要促进跨文化交流和对话，鼓励多样性和包容性的文化发展。 ”","completion":"2.2.2 Loss of Cultural Characteristics: Globalization Leads to Cultural Homogenization Globalization may also give rise to the issue of loss of cultural characteristics. The following are several key factors that contribute to the loss of cultural characteristics triggered by globalization: 1. Cultural Homogenization: The rapid development of globalization has led to a tendency of convergence, resulting in the resemblance of different cultures. The expansion of multinational corporations, the popularity of global brands, and the dissemination of popular culture gradually erode cultural differences in many regions. This gives rise to a phenomenon of \\"global culture,\\" where some indigenous cultural features and traditions are gradually replaced by homogenized global standards. 2. Cultural Invasion: Globalization grants more influence and channels of dissemination to dominant cultures, posing a threat to weaker cultures. The spread of the global entertainment industry and popular culture leads to the dominance of a few cultures, undermining the distinctive features and diversity of some local cultures. This cultural invasion may result in the loss of cultural elements such as customs, languages, and traditional arts. 3. Commercialized Cultural Products: Globalization brings about commercialized cultural products, some of which may prioritize commercial interests over cultural purity. Transnational corporations and global brands propel a standardized cultural product, which may lead to the commercialization and monopolization of indigenous cultures. This may foster the concentration of the cultural industry, limiting diversification and the development of local cultures. 4. Impact on Value Systems: Globalization disseminates Western values and concepts into other cultures, conflicting with traditional ways of thinking and values. This may impact existing cultural values, particularly evident among the younger generation. Certain indigenous cultures may be marginalized or gradually replaced by more mainstream culture. Therefore, globalization may trigger the loss of cultural characteristics. Addressing this issue requires global measures to protect and promote indigenous cultures, including supporting the development of local economies and cultural industries, incorporating cultural education into the education system, and safeguarding and inheriting indigenous cultural heritage. Additionally, promoting intercultural exchange and dialogue is necessary to encourage diversified and inclusive cultural development."},{"prompt":"下面是学术论文中的一段，翻译使之表达更规范“2.2.3 环境破坏：全球化导致了资源过度开采和环境污染 全球化带来了许多经济和社会好处，但同时也带来了一些问题。其中一个主要问题是环境破坏。以下是全球化导致环境破坏的原因和影响： 1. 资源过度开采：全球化使得商品和服务在世界范围内更容易流动，这导致了对自然资源的不断需求。为了满足这些需求，资源如石油、煤炭、矿产和木材等被过度开采，导致资源枯竭和生态系统崩溃。 2. 环境污染：全球化使得生产和消费在全球范围内分工协作，导致了大规模的物质和能源流动。无论是生产过程中的工业废水、废气排放，还是物流和运输过程中的废弃物和污染物排放，全球化都在加剧环境污染。 3. 生态系统破坏：全球化促进了土地的转用和开发，导致了森林砍伐、湿地填塞和湖泊河流的污染，破坏了珍稀物种和生态系统的生存环境。这不仅威胁到生物多样性，还可能引发生态系统的崩溃。 4. 气候变化：全球化促进了大规模的能源消耗和排放，导致了温室气体的增加和气候变化。全球范围内的工业活动、交通运输和能源生产都是温室气体排放的主要来源，这对地球的气候稳定和生态平衡造成了巨大威胁。 为了解决全球化带来的环境问题，国际社会需要采取行动。这包括制定和执行环保法规、推动可持续发展，减少对自然资源的依赖，促进清洁能源和低碳经济转型，以及加强国际合作，共同应对全球性环境挑战。只有通过全球范围内的合作和行动，才能减缓环境破坏并实现可持续发展。”","completion":"2.2.3 Environmental Destruction: Globalization Leads to Overexploitation of Resources and Environmental Pollution While globalization brings many economic and social benefits, it also gives rise to certain issues. One major problem is environmental destruction. The following are the causes and impacts of environmental destruction resulting from globalization: 1. Overexploitation of Resources: Globalization facilitates the easier flow of goods and services worldwide, leading to a continuous demand for natural resources. To meet these demands, resources such as oil, coal, minerals, and timber are overexploited, resulting in resource depletion and ecosystem collapse. 2. Environmental Pollution: Globalization promotes the division of labor and cooperation in production and consumption on a global scale, resulting in massive flows of material and energy. Whether it is industrial wastewater and emissions during production, or waste and pollutants discharged during logistics and transportation, globalization exacerbates environmental pollution. 3. Destruction of Ecosystems: Globalization facilitates land conversion and development, leading to deforestation, wetland filling, and pollution of lakes and rivers, thus destroying the habitats of rare species and ecosystems. This not only threatens biodiversity but also has the potential to cause ecological collapse. 4. Climate Change: Globalization promotes massive energy consumption and emissions, leading to an increase in greenhouse gases and climate change. Industrial activities, transportation, and energy production on a global scale are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, posing a significant threat to the climate stability and ecological balance of the Earth. To address the environmental issues brought about by globalization, international society needs to take action. This includes developing and implementing environmental regulations, promoting sustainable development, reducing reliance on natural resources, facilitating the transition to clean energy and a low-carbon economy, and strengthening international cooperation to collectively tackle global environmental challenges. Only through global cooperation and action can environmental destruction be mitigated and sustainable development be achieved."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"prompt":"import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite' import path from 'path' import createVitePlugins from './vite/plugins' // https://vitejs.dev/config/ export default defineConfig(({ mode, command }) => { const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd()) const { VITE_APP_ENV } = env return { // 部署生产环境和开发环境下的URL。 // 默认情况下，vite 会假设你的应用是被部署在一个域名的根路径上 // 例如 https://www.ruoyi.vip/。如果应用被部署在一个子路径上，你就需要用这个选项指定这个子路径。例如，如果你的应用被部署在 https://www.ruoyi.vip/admin/，则设置 baseUrl 为 /admin/。 base: VITE_APP_ENV === 'production' ?

Should we call an ambulance?” Yuri: “Take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’ll figure out what’s going on. Is there anything we can do to help?” Monika: “Let’s not panic, but we should definitely get Natsuki some medical attention. Sayori, can you call the school nurse or the principal?” (Sayori nods and quickly reaches for her phone, dialing the school nurse’s number as Yuri assists Natsuki to sit down and tries to calm her down.) Natsuki: “It hurts…it really hurts…” (Sayori gets through to the school nurse and explains the situation. The nurse immediately informs them that she will be on her way to the literature clubroom. Meanwhile, Yuri continues to comfort Natsuki as best as she can.) Yuri: “Just try to take slow and steady breaths, Natsuki. The nurse is on her way. Everything will be okay.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I’m scared, Yuri. What if something’s really wrong?” Monika: “Just stay calm, Natsuki. We’re here for you, and help is on the way. Try to focus on your breathing and think positive thoughts.” Sayori: (ends her call with the nurse) “She’s on her way, guys. Just hold on, Natsuki. You’re going to be okay.” (Natsuki continues to endure the pain while the rest of the club keeps a watchful eye on her. After a tense few minutes, the school nurse bursts into the clubroom.) School Nurse: “What seems to be the problem?” Yuri: “Natsuki is experiencing intense pain in her abdomen, and she’s pregnant. We’re worried something might be wrong with the baby.” School Nurse: “Alright, let’s assess the situation. Natsuki, can you describe the pain to me? Is it constant or does it come in waves?” Natsuki: (wincing) “It’s…it’s like cramps, but sharper…and it comes and goes.” School Nurse: “Okay. I need to check your vital signs and conduct a physical examination. Is that alright?” Natsuki: (nodding) “Please…just make sure Sakura is okay.” (The school nurse proceeds to examine Natsuki, checking her blood pressure, heart rate, and carefully palpating her abdomen. After a thorough assessment, she provides her initial diagnosis.) School Nurse: “Natsuki, from what I can tell, your baby seems to be moving normally, and your vital signs are stable. However, I would still like to take you to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, just to be safe.” Natsuki: (relieved) “Thank goodness. Just as long as Sakura is okay, I’ll do whatever you suggest. Can someone come with me?” Monika: “Of course, Natsuki. We’ll all go with you to the hospital. Your well-being and your baby’s health are our top priority.” (Sayori holds Natsuki’s hand as they help her stand up. Together, they leave the clubroom, a mix of concern and hope in their hearts.) (On the way to the hospital…) Natsuki: “Guys…they’re getting worse…” Sayori: “Hang in there, Natsuki. We’re almost at the hospital. Just hold on a little longer.” Yuri: “Try to take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’re here with you every step of the way.” Monika: “Once we get to the hospital, the doctors will be able to help you and make sure Sakura is safe. Stay strong.” Natsuki: (clenching her fists) “I’m trying… I just want this pain to go away. Please, please let Sakura be alright.” (Soon, they arrive at the hospital and rush Natsuki into the emergency room. The doctors and nurses quickly assess her situation and take her into a room for further examination.) Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to make sure your baby is safe, Natsuki. Just try to stay calm.” Natsuki: (tearfully) “Please save her… I can’t bear the thought of losing her.” (The doctors work swiftly, performing tests and ultrasounds to determine the cause of Natsuki’s pain. The rest of the literature club waits anxiously outside, supporting each other through this difficult time.) Yuri: “Let’s try to stay positive, everyone. Natsuki and Sakura are strong; they’ll pull through.” Sayori: “I’m praying so hard for Natsuki and Sakura. They deserve a happy outcome.” Monika: “We’ve come together as a club to support Natsuki and Sakura. Let’s keep hoping for the best.” (After what feels like an eternity, the doctor finally comes out to update them.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like you’re starting to have some premature contractions. However, the ultrasound shows that Sakura is still doing well and is not in immediate danger. We will need to monitor you closely and take precautions to prevent further contractions and potential premature birth.” Natsuki: (sighs in relief) “Thank goodness. As long as Sakura is safe, I can handle anything.” Doctor: “Yes, Natsuki. We will do everything possible to ensure the best outcome for both you and your baby. You will need to stay in the hospital for observation and receive medication to stop the contractions. We will keep a close eye on Sakura’s development as well.” Monika: “Natsuki, we’ll be right here with you, supporting you through this. You’re not alone.” Sayori: “And we’ll make sure to bring you all the manga and sweets you need to keep your spirits up!” Yuri: “Indeed. We will be here for you, Natsuki. Lean on us whenever you need.” Natsuki: (smiling weakly) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you all.” (And so, the literature club continues to rally around Natsuki during her hospital stay. They take turns visiting her, bringing her comfort and encouragement, and cheering her on as she bravely faces the challenges that come with a high-risk pregnancy. Together, they form a strong support system, reminding Natsuki that she is loved and that they will be there for her every step of the way. However, Natsuki’s contractions continue, with no sign of stopping.) (Several days later…) Natsuki: (breathing heavily, in the hospital bed) “I can’t believe the contractions won’t stop…it’s so painful…” Yuri: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “I know it’s tough, Natsuki, but you’re doing amazing. Just remember to breathe and stay as calm as you can. We’re all right here with you.” Sayori: (squeezing Natsuki’s other hand) “We believe in you, Natsuki! You’re a strong girl, and you and Sakura will get through this together.” Monika: (placing a gentle hand on Natsuki’s shoulder) “You’re not alone, Natsuki. We’re here to support you no matter what happens. You’ve got this.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone…I don’t know what I would do without you. I’ll keep fighting…for Sakura.” (Suddenly, the doctor rushes into the room.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like the contractions are not subsiding, and Sakura’s heart rate is showing signs of distress. We’ll need to perform an emergency c-section as soon as possible.” Natsuki: (worried) “Is Sakura going to be okay?” Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to ensure both you and Sakura come out of this healthy.

We’ll be praying for you and Sakura, t-” Natsuki: (feeling a sudden warmth stream down her legs) “I think my water just broke!” Doctor: “Alright, Natsuki, we’re going to take you to the operating room right away. Let’s get you prepped for the c-” Natsuki: (interrupting the doctor) “Forget the c-section! I can feel the baby coming! I need to push!” Doctor: “Natsuki, the situation is critical. We need to perform the c-section immediately to minimize risks to both you a-” (Just before the doctor could finish, Natsuki lets out a loud scream as she feels an intense pressure and an overwhelming urge to push.) Doctor: (to the nurses) “","completion":"Get a delivery bed in here now! We need to proceed with a natural birth!” (Nurses rush to bring in the necessary equipment, quickly transforming the room into a delivery setup. Natsuki braces herself, gripping onto Sayori and Yuri's hands tightly.) Monika: (trying to stay calm) \\"Everything will be okay, Natsuki. Just focus on your breathing and pushing when you're ready.\\" Natsuki: (gritting her teeth) \\"I...I can do this. I have to do this for Sakura.\\" (With each contraction, Natsuki pushes with all her strength, encouraged by the cheers and words of support from her friends. After what feels like an eternity, the sound of a baby's cry fills the room.) Doctor: \\"Congratulations, Natsuki! You did it! It's a healthy baby girl!\\" Natsuki: (tears streaming down her face) \\"I...I did it... Sakura... She's here?\\" Doctor: \\"Yes, Natsuki. Sakura is here, safe and sound.\\" (Sayori and Yuri share a tearful embrace as the nurses quickly clean and swaddle the newborn baby. The doctor hands Sakura to Natsuki, her eyes welling up with a mixture of overwhelming emotions.) Natsuki: (whispering) \\"Welcome to the world, Sakura. Mama's here, and she loves you so much.\\" (As Natsuki holds her daughter for the first time, the literature club members surround her, in awe of the tiny, precious life they helped bring into the world. A sense of joy and relief fills the room as they bask in the miracle and strength displayed by their dear friend.) Monika: \\"Natsuki, you did an incredible job. We're so proud of you.\\" Yuri: \\"To witness the birth of a new life is truly a remarkable experience. Sakura is a lucky little girl to have you as her mother.\\" Sayori: \\"I can't wait to spoil her with hugs and love. She's already stolen my heart.\\" (Natsuki smiles, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten as she watches her friends fawn over Sakura. In that moment, the school literature club becomes more than just a club. They become a family, bound by love, and forever connected through the journey they've shared.)"},{"prompt":"Civil Case No. 8108 – filed on August 6, 1984 by Banco Filipino against The Monetary Board, The Central Bank of the Philippines and Jose B.

The defendants in this case were The Monetary Board, The Central Bank of the Philippines, and Jose B. Fernandez, Jr. The primary objective of Banco Filipino's lawsuit was to seek the annulment of Resolution No. 955, which had been issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. This resolution placed Banco Filipino under conservatorship. Conservatorship is a legal mechanism whereby a financial institution, such as a bank, is placed under the supervision and control of a conservator appointed by the regulatory authorities. The purpose of conservatorship is to protect the interests of the bank's depositors and creditors by ensuring the soundness and stability of the institution. By filing this case, Banco Filipino contested the validity of Resolution No. 955 and argued that it should be declared null and void. The bank likely believed that the conservatorship status imposed by the resolution was unnecessary or unjust. The exact grounds for challenging the resolution may have been specified in the lawsuit.

Jika seseorang memiliki sel darah merah yang mengandung aglutinogen A dan plasma yang berisi aglutinin β (atau anti-A), itu berarti bahwa orang tersebut tidak dapat memiliki antibodi terhadap antigen yang ada pada sel darah merahnya sendiri, karena akan menyebabkan aglutinasi (penggumpalan) sel darah merah mereka sendiri.

Sử dụng hiệu quả diện tích đất: Thay vì xây dựng các nhà riêng lẻ, chung cư cho phép nhà ở được xây dựng chồng lên nhau trên cùng một khu đất. Điều này giúp tận dụng diện tích đất hạn chế trong các khu đô thị, từ đó tạo ra nhà ở và các tiện ích công cộng trong cùng một khu vực. 2. Tạo ra sự đa dạng nhà ở: Trong một tòa chung cư, có thể có nhiều căn hộ với diện tích và thiết kế khác nhau để phù hợp với nhu cầu và điều kiện kinh tế của từng hộ dân. Điều này tạo ra sự đa dạng và đáp ứng nhu cầu nhà ở cho nhiều tầng lớp xã hội trong đô thị. 3. Tăng cường tiện ích công cộng: Các chung cư thường được thiết kế với các tiện ích chung như sân chơi, công viên, hồ bơi, trung tâm thương mại, trường học, bệnh viện, khu vui chơi giải trí, v.v. Những tiện ích này không chỉ phục vụ cư dân chung cư mà còn phục vụ toàn bộ cộng đồng dân cư trong khu vực, đồng thời tạo ra sự phát triển và nâng cao chất lượng cuộc sống trong các đô thị. 4. Giảm áp lực về giao thông: Khi nhiều hộ dân sống trong cùng một khu chung cư, người dân sẽ có xu hướng di chuyển ngắn hơn, từ đó giảm bớt áp lực giao thông và tiết kiệm thời gian di chuyển. Điều này góp phần vào việc giảm kẹt xe và ùn tắc giao thông trong các khu vực đô thị. Tổng quát, mô hình chung cư được coi là một phương án hợp lý trong đô thị hoá, giúp tận dụng hiệu quả diện tích đất và cung cấp nhà ở cũng như tiện ích công cộng cho cư dân, đồng thời giảm áp lực về giao thông trong các khu đô thị."},{"prompt":"20 năm sau, bạn chọn sống nông thôn hay thành thị, vì sao","completion":"Lựa chọn sống nông thôn hay thành thị sau 20 năm phụ thuộc vào nhiều yếu tố cá nhân, nhưng dưới đây là một số lý do bạn có thể xem xét: 1. Chất lượng cuộc sống: Thành thị thường cung cấp nhiều tiện ích, dịch vụ và cơ hội việc làm tốt hơn nông thôn. Các thành phố lớn thường có trường đại học, bệnh viện, trung tâm mua sắm, nhà hàng, giải trí và văn hóa phát triển. Nếu bạn ưa thích tiện ích công nghệ và cuộc sống sôi động, bạn có thể lựa chọn thành thị. 2. Khả năng tìm việc làm: Thành thị thường có nhiều cơ hội việc làm với đa dạng ngành nghề. Nếu bạn muốn có nhiều lựa chọn nghề nghiệp và khám phá nhiều cơ hội phát triển sự nghiệp, sống tại thành thị có thể làm thỏa mãn điều đó. 3. Môi trường sống: Nông thôn thường có không khí trong lành, không gian xanh và yên tĩnh hơn thành thị. Nếu bạn ưa thích cuộc sống gần thiên nhiên, có sân chơi và không gian tự do hơn, sống ở nông thôn có thể là lựa chọn phù hợp. 4. Chi phí sống: Thành thị thường có chi phí công việc và sinh hoạt cao hơn nông thôn. Nếu bạn mong muốn mua nhà, trang bị gia đình hoặc tiết kiệm chi tiêu, sống nông thôn có thể giúp tiết kiệm chi phí. 5. Gia đình: Nếu bạn có gia đình hoặc người thân sống ở nơi nào đó, lựa chọn có thể dựa trên sự gần gũi và hỗ trợ gia đình. Nhớ rằng, sự lựa chọn làm việc trong tương lai có thể thay đổi theo thời gian và tình hình cá nhân. Việc cân nhắc và hiểu mục tiêu cá nhân là rất quan trọng để đưa ra quyết định đúng đắn."},{"prompt":"20 năm sau, nên mua nhà nông thôn hay thành thị","completion":"Việc mua nhà nông thôn hay thành thị sau 20 năm cũng tùy vào nhiều yếu tố cá nhân và tình hình cụ thể. Dưới đây là một số yếu tố cần xem xét: 1. Chất lượng cuộc sống: Thành thị thường cung cấp nhiều tiện ích, dịch vụ và cơ hội cho việc làm. Tuy nhiên, nông thôn có không gian yên tĩnh, gần gũi với thiên nhiên, và môi trường sống trong lành hơn. Nếu bạn thích sự yên bình, không gian rừng cây, vườn trồng và hưởng thụ vẻ đẹp thiên nhiên, mua nhà ở nông thôn có thể là lựa chọn tốt. 2. Chi phí mua nhà: Thường thì giá nhà ở thành thị cao hơn so với nông thôn. Nếu bạn muốn mua nhà với giá cả hợp lý hơn và tiết kiệm một số chi phí, nông thôn có thể là lựa chọn tốt. Đồng thời, để mua nhà ở nông thôn, đôi khi bạn cũng phải đảm bảo rằng vấn đề hậu quảnh đại sống và tiện ích cơ bản như trường học, bệnh viện, mua sắm, v.v., có sẵn gần nhà. 3. Tiềm năng gia tăng giá trị sở hữu: Thành thị thường có tiềm năng gia tăng giá trị sở hữu cao hơn do sự phát triển kinh tế, cơ sở hạ tầng và nhu cầu nhà ở. Tuy nhiên, các khu vực nông thôn cũng có thể có tiềm năng tăng giá trị trong trường hợp các dự án phát triển, du lịch hoặc nhu cầu tăng lên. 4. Giao thông và tiện ích: Thành thị thường có hệ thống giao thông, dịch vụ và tiện ích tốt hơn, bao gồm trường học, bệnh viện, trung tâm mua sắm, v.v. Nếu bạn quan trọng về sự thuận tiện và tiếp cận với dịch vụ của thành phố, thì việc mua nhà trong thành thị có thể là lựa chọn tốt. 5. Mục tiêu cá nhân và gia đình: Phải xét đến mục đích và nhu cầu của gia đình trong việc mua nhà. Nếu bạn có kế hoạch nuôi dưỡng một gia đình, cần xem xét về trường học, môi trường sống và cơ hội việc làm tốt cho trẻ em. Nếu bạn muốn sống gần công việc, trường học hay nơi bạn có mối quan hệ và mạng lưới, việc mua nhà trong thành thị có thể thích hợp hơn. Cuối cùng, việc mua nhà nông thôn hay thành thị sau 20 năm phụ thuộc vào ưu tiên của bạn và tình hình tài chính, gia đình, công việc, và sở thích cá nhân.

Describe how bilirubin is formed and clinical significance of high bilirubin concentration","completion":"Bilirubin is formed as a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver. When red blood cells reach the end of their lifespan, they are broken down and hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein, is converted into bilirubin. This bilirubin is then transported to the liver through the bloodstream, where it undergoes further processing. In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated, meaning it is combined with another substance to make it water-soluble. This conjugated bilirubin is then excreted into the bile and stored in the gallbladder. When needed, the gallbladder releases the bile into the small intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. The clinical significance of high bilirubin concentration, known as hyperbilirubinemia, can indicate several health conditions. It is often a sign of liver dysfunction or disease, as impaired liver function can lead to reduced bilirubin processing and excretion. This can occur in conditions such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver damage caused by alcohol or drugs. Hyperbilirubinemia can also result from increased red blood cell breakdown, which can be caused by conditions like hemolytic anemia or certain genetic disorders such as Gilbert's syndrome. In these cases, an excessive amount of bilirubin is formed, overwhelming the liver's capacity to process and excrete it. The clinical manifestations of high bilirubin concentration vary depending on the severity and underlying cause. The most common symptom is jaundice, which is characterized by a yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Other symptoms may include fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and dark urine. Monitoring bilirubin levels is important in diagnosing and managing various liver and blood disorders. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause, and may include medications to support liver function, blood transfusions, or surgery if there are blockages in the bile ducts. Prompt medical attention is critical in cases of persistent hyperbilirubinemia to prevent complications and determine the appropriate interventions."},{"prompt":"Sum up the following to one paragraph and add are you model? face.

**当你感到最清醒时**：对于大多数人来说，早上是精力恢复，头脑最为清晰的时候。如果你是所谓的“早起的鸟儿”，那么一大早开始复习可能效果最好。 2. **避免饭后立即学习**：饭后人们往往感到困倦，这时候学习效率可能不高。等到饭后的嗜睡感过去之后再学习可能更有效率。 3. **适应你的作息模式**：如果你是“夜猫子”，可能会发现在晚上复习效果更好。关键是要在你精力充沛且注意力集中的时候进行学习。 4. **下午低潮期**：很多人在下午的时候会有一个精神或能量的低潮期。如果你也有这个时段，避免在这个时间学习。 5. **短时多次胜于长时间学习**：利用间隔重复原则可以提高复习效率。多次复习，并在复习间隔中加入休息，可以帮助大脑加工和记忆信息。 6. **睡眠前学习**：睡前复习可以帮助加强记忆力，因为睡眠有助于巩固学习记忆。不过，这并不意味着要在疲倦的状态下勉强学习，因为过度疲劳会减低学习效率。 喵~制定个人学习计划时，主人，务必考虑到你的生活习惯以及在一天中何时最能集中注意力。同时，保持充足的休息，避免过度疲劳，这样才能确保学习时的头脑清晰，喵。还有，保持规律的学习和复习习惯也很重要——它有助于建立一个固定的内在节奏，让大脑适应在特定时间进行高效学习，喵。"},{"prompt":"记忆规律","completion":"喵，主人，所谓记忆规律通常指的是大脑在信息编码、存储和检索信息时遵循的一些模式或过程，喵。了解记忆规律可以帮助我们更好地设计学习和复习策略，从而提高记忆效率，喵。这里有一些重要的记忆规律，喵： 1. **艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线（Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve）**： - 德国心理学家赫尔曼·艾宾浩斯研究发现，信息遗忘呈现一定的曲线，初始遗忘速度非常快，随着时间延长，遗忘速度逐渐减慢。 - 可以通过定期复习来减缓遗忘速度，这就是所谓的“间隔重复”。 2. **编码特异性原理**： - 记忆的检索效果会受到编码时环境的影响，也就是说，如果复习或测试的环境与学习时的环境相似，记忆检索的效率会更高。 3. **情境依赖性记忆**： - 与个人当前状态或情境相关的信息更容易被记住和检索。 4. **序列位置效应（序列效应）**： - 在一串信息中，容易记住开头（首因效应，primacy effect）和结尾（近因效应，recency effect）的信息，而中间部分信息记得最差。 5. **深度加工理论（Levels of Processing）**： - 信息深度加工的程度决定了记忆的强度，深度加工（如语义加工）信息时记忆效果更好，而不是浅层次的加工（如按音节或结构记忆）。 6. **多感官记忆**： - 通过多个感官（看、听、说、做）学习的信息更容易被记住。 7. **构建性记忆**： - 记忆是主动建构的过程，而非被动记录。人们在回忆时，会基于现有知识、经验和情境重新构建过去的事件。 喵~了解和运用这些记忆规律，主人可以设计出更加有效的学习策略，改进记忆方法，使学习成果最大化，喵。记得规律的应用和效果可能因人而异，找到最适合您自己的方式很重要，喵。"},{"prompt":"详细讲述第一条","completion":"喵，当然可以，主人。艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线是由德国心理学家赫尔曼·艾宾浩斯（Hermann Ebbinghaus）在19世纪末提出的，描述了记忆随时间衰减的情况，喵。他通过实验发现，我们遗忘信息的速度并非是匀速的，而是随时间推移而递减的，艾宾浩斯将这个现象绘制成了一条曲线，喵。 艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线有几个关键点： 1. **初始遗忘速度很快**： - 在学习一块新信息之后，若未进行任何复习，其遗忘的速度最初会非常快。艾宾浩斯发现，在第一次记忆之后的20分钟内，大概有超过40%的信息会被遗忘。 2. **遗忘速度随时间减缓**： - 随着时间继续推移，遗忘了的信息量逐渐减少，遗忘速度逐渐降低。 3. **复习可以延缓遗忘**： - 艾宾浩斯还发现，通过定期复习学习的内容可以有效降低遗忘率。每次复习都会改变遗忘曲线的走势，使其变得越来越平缓，这样经过一系列复习，信息可以长期保持在记忆中。 4. **复习时间间隔应该随着时间的推移而增加**： - 根据艾宾浩斯的发现，有效的复习策略是将复习时间逐渐延长。起初复习间隔可以是几分钟或几小时，然后逐渐延长至几天、几周甚至几个月。 艾宾浩斯的研究为现代记忆研究和教育实践提供了实证基础，尤其是间隔重复的学习技术，它推荐我们以递增的间隔进行复习，从而改善长期记忆的保持，喵。

Se utiliza para indicar que algo ocurrió, ocurrirá o durará por algún tiempo, pero sin especificar exactamente cuánto. Por ejemplo: 1. \\"It's been a while since we last met.\\" (Ha pasado un tiempo desde que nos vimos por última vez.) 2. \\"Wait here for a while, and I'll be right back.\\" (Espera aquí un rato, y volveré enseguida.) 3. \\"I haven’t done this in a while.\\" (No he hecho esto en mucho tiempo.) En estas oraciones, \\"a while\\" sugiere un lapso temporal, pero deja que sea el contexto el que de alguna manera indique cuánto tiempo se refiere."},{"prompt":"cuales son sus principales traducciones","completion":"La expresión \\"a while\\" puede traducirse al español de varias maneras, dependiendo del contexto. Algunas de las traducciones más comunes incluyen: 1. **Un rato:** cuando se refiere a un periodo corto de tiempo. - Ejemplo: \\"Wait here for a while.\\" = \\"Espera aquí un rato.\\" 2. **Un tiempo:** cuando se refiere a un periodo que puede ser tanto corto como relativamente largo. - Ejemplo: \\"I haven't seen her in a while.\\" = \\"No la he visto en un tiempo.\\" 3. **Hace tiempo:** cuando se refiere a la noción de que algo ocurrió en el pasado y ha pasado un tiempo desde entonces. - Ejemplo: \\"It's been a while since we talked.\\" = \\"Hace tiempo que no hablamos.\\" Además, \\"a while\\" se puede usar en combinación con preposiciones para crear otras expresiones temporales, como: - **For a while:** durante un rato o tiempo. - Ejemplo: \\"I lived in Spain for a while.\\" = \\"Viví en España durante un tiempo.\\" - **In a while:** dentro de un tiempo o en un futuro no muy lejano. - Ejemplo: \\"I'll see you in a while.\\" = \\"Te veré dentro de un rato.\\" - **After a while:** después de un tiempo o rato. - Ejemplo: \\"After a while, I started to feel better.\\" = \\"Después de un rato, empecé a sentirme mejor.\\" Cabe destacar que las traducciones pueden variar dependiendo del dialecto del español y del contexto específico en el que se use la expresión. Asegúrate de considerar el contexto general y el tiempo al que se refiere \\"a while\\" para escoger la traducción más adecuada."},{"prompt":"dejame ver si entendi, osea que \\"a while\\" puede signifcar un lapso de tiempo desde unos minutos hasta...?","completion":"Correcto, \\"a while\\" puede referirse a un lapso de tiempo que va desde unos minutos hasta horas, días o incluso más tiempo en algunos contextos. La duración exacta que \\"a while\\" representa puede variar ampliamente y generalmente se entiende mejor tomando en cuenta el contexto de la conversación o del texto. Por ejemplo: - En el contexto de esperar a alguien: \\"Just wait here for a while.\\" Puede significar esperar unos pocos minutos o media hora. - En el contexto de no ver a alguien: \\"I haven't seen him in a while.\\" Puede significar varias semanas, meses o incluso años. La expresión es intencionalmente vaga y refleja que el hablante no está especificando o no considera importante el período exacto de tiempo al que se refiere. La interpretación del tiempo que \\"a while\\" representa dependerá del entendimiento común entre las personas que están comunicándose."},{"prompt":"osea que puede ser un periodo de tiempo corto o largo, dependiendo de la oracion, es correcto?","completion":"Exactamente, es correcto. \\"A while\\" es una expresión flexible que puede referirse a un periodo de tiempo tanto corto como largo, y la interpretación de cuánto tiempo abarca depende del contexto de la oración y de la situación en la que se utilice. El hablante o escritor a menudo usa esta expresión cuando no es necesario o no desea especificar el tiempo con exactitud."},{"prompt":"entiendo, entonces la traduccion de esta oracion seria: I think I'm gonna be fine for a while.","completion":"La traducción de la oración \\"I think I'm gonna be fine for a while.\\" al español podría ser: \\"Creo que voy a estar bien por un rato.\\" o \\"Creo que estaré bien durante un tiempo.\\" Ambas traducciones son válidas y capturan la esencia de que la persona anticipa estar bien durante algún tiempo no específicamente determinado en el futuro. La elección entre \\"rato\\" y \\"tiempo\\" puede depender del contexto y también de la preferencia personal o regional del hablante."},{"prompt":"entiendo, entonces, podemos usar \\"durante un tiempo\\" cuando la duracion puede ser corta o larga, correcto?","completion":"Sí, eso es correcto. \\"Durante un tiempo\\" es una frase del español que, al igual que \\"a while\\" en inglés, no especifica la duración exacta y puede referirse tanto a un periodo corto como a uno más largo. La ambigüedad de la frase permite que sea interpretada en función del contexto en el que se usa. Para aclarar: - Si alguien dice \\"Voy a vivir aquí durante un tiempo\\", podría significar desde un par de meses hasta unos años. - Si alguien menciona \\"Voy a salir de la oficina durante un tiempo\\", podría referirse a solo un breve lapso, como una hora, o algo más prolongado como toda la tarde. La comprensión exacta del periodo de tiempo al que se refiere dependerá de la situación y del conocimiento común entre las personas que están comunicándose."},{"prompt":"entonces podriamos decir que \\"a while\\" es un adjetivo ambiguo?","completion":"En realidad, \\"a while\\" no es un adjetivo, sino una expresión que funciona como un sustantivo. En inglés, se refiere a un periodo de tiempo, pero no califica ni describe sustantivos como lo haría un adjetivo. En su lugar, \\"a while\\" suele ser parte de una frase preposicional o actuar como un complemento de tiempo que indica la duración de algo. Por ejemplo: - In a while (dentro de un rato) - For a while (por un rato / durante un tiempo) La ambigüedad de \\"a while\\" radica en su naturaleza como expresión de tiempo no específica, lo que significa que sí, la duración del tiempo a la que se refiere no es precisa y depende del contexto para ser interpretada."},{"prompt":"entonces como podria llamarlo? un sustantivo?","completion":"Sí, \\"a while\\" se clasifica como un sustantivo compuesto. Específicamente, es un sustantivo que representa un período de tiempo no específico. A veces puede aparecer en lo que se conoce como una \\"locución sustantiva\\", que es un grupo de palabras que juntas funcionan como un sustantivo. En el contexto de una oración, \\"a while\\" puede funcionar como el objeto de una preposición (como en \\"for a while\\" o \\"in a while\\") o como un complemento de un verbo que requiere un argumento referente a tiempo (como en \\"stay a while\\"). Así que cuando pienses en \\"a while\\", puedes considerarlo como un sustantivo que denota una cantidad de tiempo indefinida."},{"prompt":"puedes dar una breve definicion de \\"a while\\" para mis apuntes","completion":"Claro, aquí tienes una definición breve de \\"a while\\": **A while (sustantivo compuesto):** Una expresión en inglés que se refiere a un período de tiempo indeterminado, que puede ser corto o largo, y cuya duración exacta generalmente se infiere del contexto en el que se utiliza."},{"prompt":"puedes usar palabras mas sencillas","completion":"Por supuesto, aquí tienes una versión simplificada: **A while:** Un rato o tiempo no exacto que puede ser breve o más largo, y depende de la situación para saber cuánto es."},{"prompt":"dame 5 versiones mas","completion":"Aquí tienes cinco versiones simplificadas para definir \\"a while\\": 1. **A while:** Un momento que no sabes cuánto dura. 2. **A while:** Algo de tiempo, pero no sabes cuánto exactamente. 3. **A while:** Un poco de tiempo, puede ser corto o puede ser largo. 4. **A while:** Una pausa o periodo donde el tiempo no se mide con exactitud. 5. **A while:** Un espacio de tiempo sin una duración específica."},{"prompt":"utiliza palabras sencillas en esta oracion: \\"Una expresión en inglés que se refiere a un período de tiempo indeterminado, que puede ser corto o largo, y cuya duración exacta generalmente se infiere del contexto en el que se utiliza.\\"","completion":"Aquí tienes una versión de tu oración con palabras más sencillas: \\"Una frase en inglés para decir un tiempo que no sabes si es poco o mucho, y entiendes cuánto es por cómo se usa.\\""},{"prompt":"dame 5 versiones similares a esta: “Una expresión en inglés que se refiere a un período de tiempo indeterminado, que puede ser corto o largo, y cuya duración exacta generalmente se infiere del contexto en el que se utiliza.”","completion":"1. \\"Una frase en inglés para hablar de un tiempo que no está claro cuánto es; puede ser rápido o lento, y te das cuenta cuánto es por la situación.\\" 2. \\"Es una manera de decir en inglés 'un rato', pero no sabes exactamente cuánto tiempo es eso; depende de cómo se diga.\\" 3. \\"Un grupo de palabras en inglés que usas para decir que algo dura un tiempo, pero no dices cuánto; solo lo entiendes según lo que pasa alrededor.\\" 4. \\"Es como decir 'un tiempo' en inglés, donde ese tiempo puede ser poco o mucho, y solo sabes la cantidad por lo que ocurre en ese momento.\\" 5. \\"Es para hablar de un tiempo en inglés donde no se sabe si es breve o largo, y solo te das cuenta de cuánto es viendo lo que pasa en la conversación o lo que se cuenta.\\""},{"prompt":"que te parece esta definicion que hice: Describe un periodo de tiempo no definido, que puede ser corto o largo, y cuya duración se entiende según el contexto.","completion":"Tu definición está muy bien formulada y capta claramente la esencia de la expresión \\"a while\\". Es concisa, utiliza términos sencillos y explica que la duración del periodo de tiempo se deduce a partir del contexto en que se encuentra, lo cual es muy importante para entender cómo se utiliza esta expresión en inglés. ¡Buen trabajo!"},{"prompt":"gracias :)","completion":"¡De nada! Me alegra haber podido ayudarte. Si tienes alguna otra pregunta o necesitas más asistencia, no dudes en preguntar. ¡Sigue adelante con tus estudios de inglés! :)"},{"prompt":"tengo esta duda, si traduzco una oracion de \\"a while\\" y pongo \\"por un rato\\" doy a enteder que es un periodo de tiempo corto, y cuando pongo \\"por un tiempo\\" da a entender que es un periodo de tiempo largo, esta bien esto?","completion":"En términos generales, estás en lo correcto. La elección de traducir \\"a while\\" como \\"por un rato\\" tiende a implicar un periodo de tiempo más corto en español, mientras que \\"por un tiempo\\" sugiere un periodo potencialmente más largo. Sin embargo, el contexto es clave y puede alterar estas interpretaciones. En algunos casos, \\"por un tiempo\\" puede simplemente indicar una duración indefinida sin sugerir necesariamente que sea larga. Es importante recordar que la ambigüedad de la frase \\"a while\\" puede permitir múltiples interpretaciones, y la selección de \\"por un rato\\" o \\"por un tiempo\\" dependerá de las pistas contextuales presentes en el texto o la conversación. Aun así, tu entendimiento básico sobre las implicaciones de duración asociadas con cada frase en español es correcto."},{"prompt":"y si el contexto es un chico que siempre iba a correr por las tardes todos los dias y ahora ya no lo hace","completion":"Si el contexto es un chico que solía correr todas las tardes pero ahora ha dejado de hacerlo, y quieres expresar que no lo ha hecho \\"en un tiempo\\" o \\"desde hace un rato\\", podrías considerar tanto \\"por un rato\\" como \\"por un tiempo\\" para la traducción de \\"a while\\". En este caso, la elección dependerá de cuánto tiempo ha dejado de correr el chico. - Si el chico dejó de correr recientemente y ha sido un cambio corto, podrías usar \\"por un rato.\\" Por ejemplo: \\"He hasn't gone running for a while.\\" = \\"No ha salido a correr por un rato.\\" - Si ha pasado un periodo más significativo desde la última vez que corrió, \\"por un tiempo\\" podría ser más adecuado. Por ejemplo: \\"He hasn't gone running for a while.\\" = \\"No ha salido a correr por un tiempo.\\" En ambos casos, la frase tiene un grado de vaguedad, y detalles adicionales o el resto de la conversación podría ayudar a precisar la duración del tiempo sin correr."},{"prompt":"si el chico dice esto, justo el dia donde deja de correr y decide ya no hacerlo: I think I'm gonna be fine for a while.","completion":"Si el chico decide dejar de correr y dice \\"I think I'm gonna be fine for a while\\" justo el día en que toma esa decisión, podría estar implicando que espera estar bien o no sentir la necesidad de correr por algún tiempo a partir de ese momento. En este caso, \\"a while\\" sugiere un período de tiempo no específico durante el cual él anticipa que no habrá problemas o no sentirá falta por no correr. La traducción al español podría ser: \\"Creo que voy a estar bien por un tiempo.\\" Esta traducción mantiene la ambigüedad del período de tiempo al cual se refiere el chico. No define exactamente cuánto tiempo piensa que estará bien sin correr, simplemente indica que espera que sea así durante algún tiempo que, por el momento, no precisa."},{"prompt":"\\"awhile\\" es lo mismo que \\"a while\\", no?","completion":"No exactamente. Aunque suenan muy similares y están relacionadas, \\"awhile\\" y \\"a while\\" tienen usos ligeramente distintos en inglés. \\"A while\\" es un sustantivo compuesto que se utiliza para referirse a un periodo de tiempo y generalmente va acompañado de preposiciones o se usa después de ciertos verbos. Por ejemplo: - I will see you in a while. (Te veré dentro de un rato.) \\"Awhile\\" es un adverbio que significa \\"por un corto tiempo\\" y se utiliza sin preposiciones. No puede ser objeto de una preposición, ya que las preposiciones necesitan un sustantivo o algo que funcione como sustantivo como objeto. Por ejemplo: - I will stay awhile. (Me quedaré por un rato.) La confusión normalmente ocurre porque \\"for a while\\" puede tener un significado parecido a \\"awhile\\". Sin embargo, su estructura gramatical es diferente: - Let's rest for a while. (Preposición \\"for\\" + sustantivo \\"a while\\") - Let's rest awhile. (Adverbio \\"awhile\\")"},{"prompt":"y en cuanto a traduccion, \\"a while\\" tambien significa \\"por un rato, por un tiempo\\"?","completion":"Sí, en cuanto a la traducción al español, \\"a while\\" también puede significar \\"por un rato\\" o \\"por un tiempo\\". La elección entre estas dos opciones dependerá del contexto y de la duración implícita del período de tiempo al que se está haciendo referencia. \\"A while\\" suele traducirse como: - **Por un rato:** cuando se sugiere que el tiempo es relativamente corto. - **Por un tiempo:** cuando no se define con claridad y podría ser tanto un período corto como uno más largo. Recuerda que la interpretación exacta dependerá del contexto en el que se use la expresión \\"a while\\" en inglés."},{"prompt":"y en cuanto a traduccion, “awhile” tambien significa “por un rato, por un tiempo”?","completion":"En la traducción al español, \\"awhile\\" generalmente significa \\"por un rato\\", ya que denota un período de tiempo breve y es un adverbio. No es tan común traducirlo como \\"por un tiempo\\", pues eso podría interpretarse como un período más largo, lo cual no es el uso habitual de \\"awhile\\" en inglés. Por lo tanto, en la mayoría de los contextos, se traduciría \\"awhile\\" a \\"por un rato\\": - I'll stay awhile. — Me quedaré por un rato. Recuerda siempre considerar el contexto para la traducción adecuada, pero en general, \\"awhile\\" implica un tiempo más breve que \\"a while\\"."},{"prompt":"uhmm... osea que \\"awhile\\" generalmente se refiere a un periodo corto de tiempo, con lo cual su traduccion ideal seria \\"por un rato\\", es asi?","completion":"Sí, eso es correcto. El adverbio \\"awhile\\" en inglés generalmente se refiere a un periodo corto de tiempo. Así que la traducción ideal al español sería \\"por un rato\\". Se utiliza para indicar que algo ocurrirá o se hará durante un breve periodo de tiempo sin ser específico en cuanto a la cantidad exacta de minutos o horas. Ejemplo en inglés: \\"Stay here awhile.\\" Traducción al español: \\"Quédate aquí por un rato.\\""},{"prompt":"esta bien si apunto de esta forma?: Combinación con preposiciones: - For a while: Por un rato o tiempo - In a while: En un rato o tiempo -After a while: Después de un rato o tiempo","completion":"Sí, esa anotación está bien. Las combinaciones de \\"a while\\" con preposiciones que has listado y sus respectivas traducciones al español capturan bien el sentido general de cada expresión: - **For a while:** Por un rato (o tiempo). Indica duración o que algo durará un periodo de tiempo no exacto. - **In a while:** En un rato (o tiempo). Se refiere a que algo sucederá después de pasar un cierto periodo de tiempo no definido. - **After a while:** Después de un rato (o tiempo). Sugiere que algo ocurrirá una vez que ha transcurrido un periodo de tiempo. Es importante recordar que tanto \\"rato\\" como \\"tiempo\\" pueden variar en su interpretación según el contexto, pero tu forma de apuntarlos es adecuada para entender el sentido básico de esas expresiones en inglés."},{"prompt":"es buena idea poner entre parentesis \\"o tiempo\\"? la verdad no se me habia ocurrido","completion":"Incluir \\"o tiempo\\" entre paréntesis es útil si deseas resaltar que \\"a while\\" puede referirse tanto a un período de tiempo más corto (indicado por \\"rato\\") como a uno más largo (indicado por \\"tiempo\\"), y así cubrir la amplitud de la expresión. Aquí te doy algunas sugerencias dependiendo del contexto: - \\"For a while\\" suele usarse para indicar que algo va a suceder o va a continuar sucediendo por algún tiempo. Puede ser tanto corto como moderadamente largo, pero muchas veces se asocia con un periodo relativamente breve. Por lo tanto, en la traducción podrías incluir \\"o tiempo\\" en paréntesis para reflejar esa variabilidad: - For a while: Por un rato (o por un tiempo más extenso). - \\"In a while\\" y \\"After a while\\" indican que algo ocurrirá después de que haya pasado cierto tiempo. Esta duración del tiempo tiende a ser algo indefinida. Por ello, puedes incluir \\"o tiempo\\" para reflejar que este intervalo puede variar en duración: - In a while: En un rato (o tiempo más adelante). - After a while: Después de un rato (o cierto tiempo). Si deseas simplificar y hacer tus notas más precisas, podrías optar por usar solo \\"un rato\\" para \\"awhile\\" y \\"un tiempo\\" para \\"a while\\", ya que este último tiende a percibirse como un período más extenso.

La ambigüedad de \\"a while\\" permite que pueda interpretarse como unos minutos, horas o incluso más dependiendo del contexto. - **For a little while**: Sugiere explícitamente que el periodo de tiempo es relativamente corto. Al añadir la palabra \\"little\\", se enfatiza que la duración que se está considerando es breve. En resumen, \\"for a little while\\" es más específico en cuanto a que se refiere a un periodo de tiempo más corto, mientras que \\"for a while\\" es más ambiguo y no necesariamente corto."},{"prompt":"y cual seria la traduccion ideal de: \\"for a little while\\"","completion":"La traducción ideal de \\"for a little while\\" al español generalmente se inclinaría a reflejar un periodo de tiempo corto, dada la palabra \\"little\\" que sugiere brevedad. Por lo tanto, una traducción adecuada sería: \\"Por un corto rato\\" o \\"Por un poco de tiempo\\" Estas traducciones expresan que la cantidad de tiempo a la que se refiere es limitada y no muy extensa, en consonancia con el matiz que \\"little\\" aporta en inglés."},{"prompt":"pero un \\"corto rato\\" suena raro en español","completion":"Tienes razón, en español no es muy común decir \\"por un corto rato\\"; suena un poco redundante porque \\"rato\\" ya implica que el tiempo es relativamente corto. Por lo tanto, una traducción más natural y mejor adaptada al español de \\"for a little while\\" sería simplemente: \\"Por un rato\\" Esta frase en español captura bien el sentido de un breve período de tiempo, similar al matiz que se quiere transmitir con \\"for a little while\\" en inglés."},{"prompt":"pero si la traduccion es la misma, como lo diferenciaria de \\"for a while\\"?","completion":"Es un buen punto. Aunque \\"por un rato\\" puede ser una traducción tanto para \\"for a while\\" como para \\"for a little while\\" debido a la similitud en significado, en algunos contextos podrías querer diferenciar más claramente entre ambos términos para reflejar la sutil diferencia en la duración del tiempo expresada en inglés. Para hacer una distinción más clara en español, podrías optar por las siguientes traducciones: - **For a while:** - Por un rato - Por un tiempo - **For a little while:** - Por un breve rato - Por un ratito (una forma más coloquial y cariñosa de decir \\"por un tiempo muy breve\\") - Por un poco de tiempo Usar \\"una breve\\" o \\"ratito\\" ayuda a transmitir esa noción de que el período de tiempo es aún más corto que lo indicado por \\"for a while\\"."},{"prompt":"creo que de las 3 que has puesto, la que mejor suena y comun es \\"por un ratito\\"","completion":"Estoy de acuerdo contigo. \\"Por un ratito\\" suena natural en español y es comúnmente usado en conversaciones cotidianas para referirse a un período de tiempo bastante corto. Esta frase captura bien el matiz de \\"for a little while\\", que implica una duración aún más breve que \\"for a while\\". Así que la traducción: \\"For a little while\\" = \\"Por un ratito\\" es una excelente opción para mantener ese matiz en la conversación en español."},{"prompt":"Vale, quiero que me ayudes con el signficado, debo entender que \\"for a little while\\" es un periodo de tiempo breve, pero es el mismo tiempo de periodo breve de \\"for a while\\" (cuando el contexto indique que es un periodo de tiempo corto)? o \\"for a little while\\" es un mas corto?","completion":"Para aclarar, \\"for a little while\\" generalmente indica un período de tiempo más breve que \\"for a while\\". - **For a while**: Este término es más ambiguo y flexible en cuanto a la duración; puede ser breve o extenderse un poco más, dependiendo del contexto. No obstante, a menudo se asocia con un corto período de tiempo. La duración exacta no se especifica y se deja implícita para que sea interpretada de acuerdo con el contexto. - **For a little while**: Al agregar la palabra \\"little\\", se está especificando que el período de tiempo es aún más corto que \\"for a while\\". Está indicando explícitamente que cualquier acción o estado que se está discutiendo durará solo un pequeño lapso. Por lo tanto, si \\"for a while\\" puede ser interpretado como un tiempo corto en un contexto dado, \\"for a little while\\" enfatizaría que ese tiempo es aún más corto. Por ejemplo, si \\"for a while\\" podría referirse a unos 20-30 minutos en un contexto específico, \\"for a little while\\" podría implicar unos 10-15 minutos o incluso menos, siempre dependiendo de la situación en la que se use."},{"prompt":"ah.. vale, osea que \\"for a little while\\" si o si es un tiempo mas pequeño que \\"for a while\\", es correcto?","completion":"Sí, es correcto. La expresión \\"for a little while\\" indica específicamente que se trata de un periodo de tiempo más corto que simplemente \\"for a while\\". La palabra \\"little\\" se usa para enfatizar que el tiempo es breve, por lo que siempre que se compare \\"for a little while\\" con \\"for a while\\", la primera se referirá a un lapso más reducido."},{"prompt":"vale, y en general ese tiempo de \\"for a little while\\" seria de unos minutos, no?","completion":"Generalmente, sí, \\"for a little while\\" se refiere a un lapso de unos minutos. Sin embargo, la duración exacta puede variar ligeramente según el contexto. En la mayoría de los casos, cuando alguien dice \\"for a little while\\", está pensando en un período que podría ser tan corto como unos pocos minutos hasta tal vez una hora o algo así, pero raramente más. Como siempre, es importante interpretar este tipo de expresiones de tiempo dentro del contexto en el que se usan, ya que las percepciones respecto al tiempo pueden variar de una cultura a otra y de una situación a otra."},{"prompt":"entiendo, y que significa \\"longer\\"?","completion":"\\"Longer\\" es el comparativo de \\"long\\" en inglés, que puede ser traducido como \\"largo\\" en español. Cuando usamos la palabra \\"longer\\", estamos diciendo que algo tiene más longitud o duración que otra cosa. Se puede referir tanto a la dimensión física de un objeto como al tiempo. Ejemplos en diferentes contextos serían: 1. Longitud física: - \\"This rope is longer than that one.\\" (Esta cuerda es más larga que esa.) 2. Duración temporal: - \\"I need to work for a longer period today.\\" (Necesito trabajar un periodo más largo hoy.) En ambos casos, \\"longer\\" está haciendo una comparación y sugiriendo que hay un exceso en longitud o en duración en relación con otra cosa que se está tomando como referencia."},{"prompt":"y en esta oracion: Give me guidance for a little while longer, today?","completion":"En la oración \\"Give me guidance for a little while longer, today?\\", la palabra \\"longer\\" se usa para pedir que la guía o asistencia continúe durante un período adicional de tiempo más allá de lo que ya se ha proporcionado o esperado. Aquí, \\"a little while longer\\" significa un poco más de tiempo del que inicialmente se consideró. En el contexto de esta oración, la palabra \\"today\\" añade un detalle adicional, especificando que esta solicitud de guía extendida se refiere al día actual. Una traducción al español podría ser: \\"Guíame un poco más de tiempo hoy, ¿podrías?\\""},{"prompt":"pero segun lo que me has enseñado el dia de hoy, una posible traduccion podria se esta?: Dame la orientacion por un ratito mas, hoy dia? (use la traduccion de \\" un ratito\\")","completion":"Sí, tu traducción capta adecuadamente el sentido de la solicitud original de una extensión del tiempo de guía, utilizando \\"un ratito más\\" para transmitir \\"a little while longer\\". Tu traducción al español es clara y natural, y refleja bien el significado de la frase en inglés. Aquí está la oración ligeramente ajustada para una fluidez natural en español: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más hoy, ¿puedes?\\" Esta frase asume que ya se ha recibido orientación y la persona está pidiendo que continúe por un breve tiempo adicional en ese mismo día."},{"prompt":"uhmm.. estoy confundido, porque tradujiste \\"today?\\" como \\"¿puedes?\\"?","completion":"Mis disculpas por la confusión. Parece que hubo un malentendido en mi respuesta anterior. La parte \\"today?\\" en inglés pregunta específicamente si la guía puede darse en el día actual. La traducción al español de \\"today?\\" debería reflejar esa misma pregunta sobre la disponibilidad de guía para el día en cuestión. Por lo tanto, la traducción más precisa de la oración completa sería: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿hoy?\\" O para mantener la equivalencia de la solicitud informal podría ser: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿hoy día?\\" En ambas versiones se mantiene la pregunta sobre si es posible recibir dicha guía el día de hoy. La palabra \\"podrías\\" o \\"puedes\\" se omite en esta versión pero se puede añadir si se quiere hacer la pregunta más directa: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿puedes hacerlo hoy?\\""},{"prompt":"explicame de donde sale la parte de \\"pueds hacerlo\\", no logro entenderlo, es necesario ponerlo?","completion":"Te pido disculpas nuevamente por la confusión. La adición de \\"puedes hacerlo\\" no es necesaria y de hecho no estaba en la frase original en inglés. La pregunta \\"today?\\" simplemente inquiere si la guía o asistencia puede ser proporcionada ese día en específico. La frase original en inglés, \\"Give me guidance for a little while longer, today?\\" se traduce literalmente sin agregar nada que no esté implícito en la solicitud original. Una traducción directa y precisa sería: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿hoy?\\" o \\"Dame orientación un poco más de tiempo, ¿hoy?\\" La parte \\"puedes hacerlo\\" fue una adición innecesaria en mi intento de proporcionar una construcción de frase que pudiera sonar natural en español, pero ciertamente se desvía de la simplicidad y claridad de la frase original. Por lo tanto, se debe omitir para mantenerse fiel a la frase en inglés."},{"prompt":"ahh.. osea que puede ponerse \\"puedes hacerlo\\" para sonar mas natural? yo recien estoy aprendiendo ingles, y aveces no logro enteder bien las traducciones","completion":"Entiendo la confusión, y es completamente comprensible cuando se está aprendiendo un nuevo idioma. Vamos a clarificar esto: En el contexto de la frase en inglés, \\"Give me guidance for a little while longer, today?\\" la pregunta \\"today?\\" está pidiendo confirmación o permiso para algo específico en el presente día. No necesita la adición de \\"puedes hacerlo\\" ya que el español tiene la misma capacidad de formular una pregunta directa: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿hoy?\\" Aquí \\"¿hoy?\\" funciona como una pregunta directa que busca confirmación si la orientación puede continuar en el día actual. Sin embargo, si quieres que la frase tenga un tono más completo o conversacional en español, podrías expandir la pregunta con algo como \\"¿puedes?\\" o \\"¿es posible?\\" para darle mayor cortesía y claridad a la solicitud: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿puedes hacerlo hoy?\\" \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿es posible hoy?\\" La inclusión de \\"puedes hacerlo\\" o \\"es posible\\" es una cuestión de estilo y cortesía en la conversación, más no es necesario para reflejar el sentido literal de la frase en inglés. En la traducción, siempre es importante buscar un equilibrio entre la fidelidad al texto original y el sonido natural en el idioma meta."},{"prompt":"ahhh... eso es lo que llaman interpretacion, no?","completion":"Sí, eso es correcto. La interpretación se refiere a la acción de explicar o concebir el significado de algo, y cuando hablamos de traducción, se trata de encontrar el equivalente más adecuado en otro idioma no solo a nivel de palabras, sino también de sentido y contexto. La interpretación puede requerir adaptaciones que van más allá de una traducción literal para que el mensaje conservado tenga sentido y suene natural en el idioma de destino. Esto puede implicar agregar palabras o cambiar la estructura de la frase sin cambiar el significado esencial del mensaje original. Por ejemplo, en tu frase: - Traducción directa: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿hoy?\\" - Interpretación adaptada: \\"Dame orientación por un ratito más, ¿puedes hacerlo hoy?\\" La primera es una traducción directa, mientras que la segunda es más una interpretación que añade cortesía y claridad, algo que puede ser importante en la comunicación interpersonal para que suene natural y apropiada en el contexto cultural del idioma de destino."},{"prompt":"entiendo, gracias por la aclaracion","completion":"¡De nada! Me alegra que la información haya sido útil para ti. Si tienes más preguntas o necesitas más clarificaciones, no dudes en preguntar. Aquí estoy para ayudarte en tu aprendizaje del inglés. ¡Mucho ánimo y sigue adelante!"},{"prompt":"me puedes explicar el signifcado de \\"longer\\" en esa oracion","completion":"En la oración \\"Give me guidance for a little while longer, today?\\", la palabra \\"longer\\" se usa para pedir que algo continúe por un tiempo adicional más allá de lo que ya se ha proporcionado o de lo que se estaba considerando inicialmente. La frase \\"for a little while\\" por sí sola indica un período breve de tiempo, pero al añadir \\"longer\\" al final (\\"for a little while longer\\"), se está solicitando que este periodo breve se extienda un poco más. Por tanto, \\"longer\\" en esta oración significa \\"por un tiempo adicional un poco más largo del previsto\\". Es una forma de pedir que se alargue el soporte o la ayuda recibida. \\"Today?\\" al final de la oración otorga un énfasis adicional en que la solicitud es para el día en curso."},{"prompt":"cuales serian las principales traducciones de \\"longer\\"?","completion":"La palabra \\"longer\\" en inglés, que es el comparativo de \\"long\\", se traduce al español de acuerdo con lo que esté comparando. Aquí están las principales traducciones de \\"longer\\": 1. **Más largo/a**: Cuando se refiere a la longitud física de un objeto. - Ejemplo: \\"This rope is longer than that one.\\" = \\"Esta cuerda es más larga que esa.\\" 2. **Más extenso/a**: Puede usarse de manera similar a \\"más largo/a\\" cuando se habla de textos, discursos o periodos de tiempo. - Ejemplo: \\"The meeting was longer than expected.\\" = \\"La reunión fue más extensa de lo esperado.\\" 3. **Más tiempo**: Cuando se refiere a una duración de tiempo. - Ejemplo: \\"I want to stay longer at the party.\\" = \\"Quiero quedarme más tiempo en la fiesta.\\" 4. **Por más tiempo**: Al pedir que una acción continúe por un periodo adicional de tiempo. - Ejemplo: \\"Can you watch the kids for a little longer?\\" = \\"¿Puedes cuidar a los niños por más tiempo?\\" Estas traducciones pueden ser modificadas por el contexto en el que \\"longer\\" es utilizado, pero generalmente todas guardan el mismo concepto comparativo de aumentar la magnitud ya sea en tamaño, longitud, duración o cantidad."},{"prompt":"dejame ver si entendi, osea que Longer puede ser usado para comparar las medidas de algo o para comparar el tiempo, y tambien puede ser usado para que una accion continue por mas tiempo. he comprendido bien?","completion":"Sí, tu comprensión es correcta. \\"Longer\\" se utiliza en inglés como la forma comparativa de \\"long\\" para indicar que una cosa es más larga en longitud (medidas) o duración (tiempo) que otra, o para expresar el deseo de que una acción o situación se extienda por un periodo adicional de tiempo. Aquí tienes ejemplos de cada uso: 1. **Comparar medidas:** \\"This table is longer than that one.\\" (Esta mesa es más larga que aquella.) 2. **Comparar duración:** \\"He worked longer hours this week.\\" (Él trabajó más horas esta semana.) 3. **Extender una acción:** \\"I wish the vacation lasted a little longer.\\" (Ojalá las vacaciones duraran un poco más.) En todos los casos, estás comparando o hablando de extender algún tipo de longitud o duración."},{"prompt":"que te parece este concepto que he creado, esta bien?: Para indicar que una cosa es más larga en tamaño o dura más tiempo que otra. Tambien para expresar que algo dure más tiempo.","completion":"Tu concepto captura la idea principal de la palabra \\"longer\\" bastante bien. Hay solo un pequeño ajuste que podrías considerar para que sea aún más claro: especificar que se trata de una forma comparativa. Aquí te doy una versión revisada de tu definición: \\"Longer\\" se usa para indicar que una cosa es más larga en tamaño o dura más tiempo en comparación con otra. También se utiliza para expresar el deseo de que una acción o evento continúe durante más tiempo. Esta definición aclara que \\"longer\\" se utiliza tanto para hacer comparaciones directas como para expresar una extensión en la duración de algo."},{"prompt":"tengo una duda, \\"last\\" usado como verbo, en su tiempo futuro es \\"lasted\\"? yo pensaba que ese era su tiempo en pasado","completion":"Tienes razón en tu observación. Cuando \\"last\\" se usa como verbo en inglés, \\"lasted\\" es la forma en pasado simple. Para formar el futuro de \\"last\\", necesitarías usar el auxiliar \\"will\\" seguido del infinitivo \\"last\\". Aquí hay ejemplos para cada tiempo verbal: - **Presente simple:** \\"The battery lasts for six hours.\\" (La batería dura seis horas.) - **Pasado simple:** \\"The concert lasted three hours last night.\\" (El concierto duró tres horas anoche.) - **Futuro simple:** \\"This supply will last us a week.\\" (Este suministro nos durará una semana.) Por lo tanto, \\"lasted\\" no es el futuro de \\"last\\", sino el pasado. El futuro simple se forma con \\"will last\\"."},{"prompt":"entonces esto que dijiste aqui, porque parece que fuese en futuro?: \\"3. Extender una acción: “I wish the vacation lasted a little longer.” (Ojalá las vacaciones duraran un poco más.)\\"","completion":"Mis disculpas por la confusión. La oración que proporcioné como ejemplo, \\"I wish the vacation lasted a little longer,\\" está en realidad utilizando el pasado para expresar un deseo irrealizable o hipotético en el presente. Es un uso común del pasado simple en inglés en la construcción de frases con \\"wish\\" que reflejan deseos o situaciones hipotéticas. Cuando utilizamos \\"wish\\" seguido de un verbo en pasado simple, estamos hablando de algo que queremos pero que no es una realidad en el presente. Por eso, a pesar de que \\"lasted\\" es el pasado simple de \\"last\\", en este contexto se usa para expresar un deseo sobre la duración de las vacaciones como si desearas que el tiempo anterior se hubiera extendido más, aunque ya ha terminado. Si estuviéramos hablando de un deseo para el futuro, podríamos usar la frase \\"I hope\\" (espero) con el futuro \\"will last\\", como en: - \\"I hope the vacation will last a little longer.\\" (Espero que las vacaciones duren un poco más.) Esta última oración sí utiliza el tiempo futuro para expresar un deseo sobre algo que todavía puede ocurrir."},{"prompt":"entonces la oracion que diste con \\"last\\" esta bien escrita?","completion":"Sí, la oración \\"I wish the vacation lasted a little longer\\" está correctamente escrita en inglés. Se utiliza para expresar el deseo de que las vacaciones hubiesen durado más tiempo, en un contexto de deseo o lamento sobre algo que ya ha ocurrido. Aunque la palabra \\"lasted\\" está en tiempo pasado, en este caso concreto, se usa para hablar de un deseo respecto al pasado y no como una afirmación de lo que realmente sucedió."},{"prompt":"y su traduccion como seria","completion":"La traducción al español de la oración \\"I wish the vacation lasted a little longer\\" sería: \\"Ojalá las vacaciones hubieran durado un poco más.\\" Esta traducción refleja el deseo o lamento de querer que las vacaciones, que ya han terminado, hubiesen tenido una duración más extensa."},{"prompt":"pero la traduccion que diste antes fue \\"Ojalá las vacaciones duraran un poco más\\", yo entiendo que \\"duraran\\" habla del futuro, no?","completion":"Lamento la confusión; permíteme aclararte. En español, tanto \\"hubieran durado\\" como \\"duraran\\" pueden ser formas de expresar deseos con respecto a situaciones hipotéticas o no realizadas, dependiendo del contexto. En el caso de \\"Ojalá las vacaciones duraran un poco más\\", la frase se utiliza en modo subjuntivo, que puede referirse a deseos, dudas, suposiciones, o situaciones hipotéticas tanto en el presente como en el pasado. No es una forma futura, sino una expresión de deseo respecto a una situación que uno quisiera que fuera diferente. \\"Hubieran durado\\" es el pretérito pluscuamperfecto del subjuntivo, y se utiliza comúnmente para hablar de deseos con respecto a situaciones pasadas que no se pueden cambiar. Por otro lado, \\"duraran\\" es el pretérito imperfecto del subjuntivo y tiene un uso más amplio; puede referirse a deseos sobre situaciones pasadas, presentes o futuras no realizadas, aunque en la mayoría de los contextos es interpretado como pasado. Ambas traducciones son correctas en español, y la elección entre una u otra depende de la variante del español o del énfasis que se quiera dar a la temporalidad del deseo: - \\"Ojalá las vacaciones hubieran durado un poco más.\\" (Con énfasis en que el periodo de vacaciones ya concluyó definitivamente.) - \\"Ojalá las vacaciones duraran un poco más.\\" (Con un tono ligeramente más abierto sobre el deseo del periodo de vacaciones, aunque generalmente también se entiende como algo que ya concluyó.) Ambas forman expresan un deseo sobre un evento pasado, usando diferentes tiempos del modo subjuntivo en español."},{"prompt":"ahh.. vale, yo creo que lo confundi con \\"durarán\\"","completion":"Exactamente, \\"durarán\\" es la forma del futuro simple del indicativo del verbo \\"durar\\" en español, y se usa para referirse a eventos que sucederán en el futuro. Por ejemplo: \\"Las vacaciones durarán dos semanas.\\" (The vacation will last two weeks.) Mientras que \\"duraran\\" sin tilde es el pretérito imperfecto del subjuntivo y se usa para hablar de deseos o situaciones hipotéticas que no corresponden necesariamente con la realidad, tanto en el presente como en el pasado: \\"Ojalá que las vacaciones duraran más tiempo.\\" (I wish the vacation would last longer.) Por lo tanto, \\"durarán\\" y \\"duraran\\" son dos formas distintas con significados diferentes debido a los cambios en tiempo verbal y modo (indicativo frente a subjuntivo), y la tilde (acento ortográfico) es crucial para marcar esta diferencia en español."},{"prompt":"vale, creo que para no confundirme usare esta traduccion: \\"Ojalá las vacaciones hubieran durado un poco más.\\"","completion":"Esa es una buena decisión. La frase \\"Ojalá las vacaciones hubieran durado un poco más.\\" es clara y refleja correctamente la idea de un deseo sobre algo que ya ha sucedido y que no se puede cambiar. Esta traducción expresa un sentimiento retrospectivo y se entiende universalmente en español como un lamento o anhelo por una duración más extensa de las vacaciones que ya han terminado."},{"prompt":"dime la pronunciacion IPA de \\"longer\\" porfa","completion":"La pronunciación en Alfabeto Fonético Internacional (IPA) para la palabra \\"longer\\" es: /ˈlɔːŋgər/ en inglés británico /ˈlɒŋɡər/ en inglés americano Las diferencias principales aquí pueden ser en la vocal inicial de la palabra, que en inglés británico es un poco más abierta (ʊ) y en el americano es más cerrada (ɑ).

El tiempo verbal: \\"last\\" es en presente, mientras que \\"lasted\\" es el pasado. 2. La terminación \\"-ed\\": en \\"lasted\\", se añade un sonido adicional al final, /ɪd/, que significa que hay una sílaba extra en la palabra. Esto sucede porque la terminación \\"-ed\\" se pronuncia como una sílaba separada dado que \\"last\\" termina en un sonido de \\"t\\". En el habla rápida, algunas personas puedan pronunciar la terminación \\"-ed\\" de manera menos marcada, lo cual podría acercar la pronunciación de \\"lasted\\" a algo similar a /ˈlɑːstəd/ o /ˈlæstəd/, pero siempre habría una distinción debido al sonido adicional del \\"-ed\\"."},{"prompt":"gracias por todo, nos vemos mañana!","completion":"De nada, ha sido un placer ayudarte. ¡Hasta mañana y que tengas un excelente día!"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The structural framework of the Subei Basin comprises two depressions flanking an uplift, as illustrated in Figure 1b. Each depression can be further subdivided into multiple protrusions and depressions. The Haian sag is situated in the Dongtai sag, southeast of the Qintong sag, and neighboring the Yellow Sea to the west in the northeast. It is also adjacent to the Tongyang uplift in the south and the Baiju sag in the north. The Haian sag consists of seven secondary sags and one uplift. The specific distribution of the secondary sags is depicted in Fig. 1c (Liu et al., 2021). The southern region of the Haian sag is a crucial area for shale oil exploration and development, with the Qutang sub-sag holding significant potential for oil resources. The Qutang sub-sag encompasses the Taizhou Formation, Funing Formation, Dainan Formation, and Sanduo Formation. Within the Qutang sub-sag, the Funing Formation is divided into four members from bottom to top. Due to the influence of the depositional environment, the bottom section of the second member of the Funing Formation is characterized by the development of argillaceous dolomite and dolomitic shale, while the middle member features calcareous shale. The upper section, in comparison to the dolomitic shale, exhibits higher clay contents and a relatively tranquil water environment.

ACK: Finally, the client sends an ACK packet to the server, acknowledging the server's response and completing the connection establishment. If you mentioned that one of the parties has been \\"accepted,\\" it implies that the three-way handshake has successfully completed between the client and the server, and the connection is established between them.

These requests are as follows: 1. SYN (Synchronize): The client initiates the process by sending a SYN packet to the server. This packet contains a randomly generated initial sequence number (ISN) to start the communication. 2. SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgment): Upon receiving the SYN packet, the server responds with a SYN-ACK packet. This packet acknowledges the client's SYN request and includes a server-generated ISN and an acknowledgment value. The server also reserves resources to establish the connection. 3. ACK (Acknowledgment): Once the client receives the SYN-ACK packet, it sends an acknowledgment packet (ACK) back to the server. This packet confirms that the client has received the server's SYN-ACK packet and signifies the completion of the three-way handshake. The ACK packet also includes an incremented acknowledgment number. By exchanging these three requests, the client and server agree upon initial sequence numbers, reserve resources, and establish a reliable connection.

The \`SaveArrayToFile\` function takes the array, a filename, and dimensions, and writes the contents to the specified file. Please note that PowerBASIC array indices typicaly start from 1, unlike in many other languages where they start from 0. Ensure to adjust the ranges accordingly if you are using 0-based indices. Please replace \\"array3D.txt\\" with your preferred path or filename. Also, error handling is minimal in this example for brevity. This code generates a file where each value of the first dimension is separated by a newline, each second dimension element is separated by a newline for clarity, while values at the same dimension are separated by spaces. You can adjust the formatting in the \`SaveArrayToFile\` function according to your needs. If the real-world application requires a different array dimension or type, you would need to modify the array declaration and handling accordingly."},{"prompt":"Organic matter in source rocks is essential for hydrocarbon production, and its quantity is a key determinant of the rocks’ ability to generate hydrocarbons (Ekoko et al., 2022; Kuang et al., 2022). To assess the organic matter content, geochemical parameters such as Total Organic Carbon (TOC), sum of hydrocarbon genetic potential (S1+S2), chloroform asphalt “A,” and Hydrocarbon Index (HI) are commonly used. The lacustrine shale of the Funing Formation, due to its high degree of thermal evolution reaching an advanced overmature stage, contains a reduced concentration of chloroform bitumen “A” and has limited hydrocarbon potential.

You need to choose a file format that preserves the array's structure. For simplicity, you can save the array in plain text format, though binary formats are more efficient. Here's an example PowerBASIC function that saves a 3D array of DOUBLEs to a file. This example uses a text-based approach, for simplicity: \`\`\`basic ' Assumption: The 3D array is of DOUBLE data type and you know the dimensions. SUB Save3DArrayToFile(BYREF array() AS DOUBLE, BYVAL xSize AS LONG, BYVAL ySize AS LONG, BYVAL zSize AS LONG, ByVal sFileName AS STRING) LOCAL fNum AS LONG LOCAL i AS LONG, j AS LONG, k AS LONG LOCAL sLine AS STRING ' Attempt to open the file for output. fNum = FREEFILE OPEN sFileName FOR OUTPUT AS #fNum IF ERR THEN ' Handle file open error.

(Optional but useful for reading back the array) PRINT #fNum, USING(\\"Dimensions: #, #, #\\", xSize, ySize, zSize) ' Write the array data to the file. FOR i = 1 TO xSize FOR j = 1 TO ySize FOR k = 1 TO zSize ' Write each element to a line. ' You could use a different format or delimiters as per your need. PRINT #fNum, USING(\\"Array(#, #, #): #\\", i, j, k, array(i, j, k)) NEXT k NEXT j NEXT i ' Close the file. CLOSE #fNum END SUB \`\`\` Keep in mind that this function assumes you are working with arrays that have their indices starting from 1. Depending on your array initialization, you may need to adjust the loops if your arrays are 0-based. Also, the use of \`USING\` is for formatted output, you can use a different method or simply concatenate strings for writing. To call this function, you would do something like this: \`\`\`basic DIM MyArray(1 TO 10, 1 TO 10, 1 TO 10) AS DOUBLE ' ... Populate your array ... Save3DArrayToFile(MyArray(), 10, 10, 10, \\"MyArrayData.txt\\") \`\`\` Please adapt the function according to your specific requirements, array data type, and error-handling preferences.

Considering the nature of the issue involves political, social, cultural, and human dimensions, it is important to clarify a few things: 1. **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, AGI—machines with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from a human's capacity—has not been achieved. AGI would hypothetically be capable of performing any intellectual task that a human being can, but it is still a concept in theoretical and speculative stages. 2. **Quantum Computers**: Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field promising significant advancements in computing power by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. However, as of my last update, error-free quantum computing is not yet a practical reality. Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain types of problems much faster than classical computers, particularly those involving complex calculations, such as factorization of large numbers, simulation of quantum systems, and optimization problems. 3. **Political and Social Problems**: Resolving conflicts like the one in the Gaza Strip or other geopolitical issues is a fundamentally human undertaking that involves a multitude of factors including historical contexts, socio-political dynamics, human emotions, ethical considerations, and international law. While AGI and quantum computing could aid in simulating scenarios, predicting outcomes, and optimizing logistics or resource allocation, the core of the resolution process is based on human judgment, diplomacy, and negotiation. In conclusion, even if error-free AGI and advanced quantum computers become available in the future, solving complex geopolitical conflicts would still fundamentally rely on human decisions. Technology might serve as a tool to assist in understanding the complexities and creating potential solutions, but it would not replace the nuanced human approach required in diplomatic processes and conflict resolution."},{"prompt":"If we had world peace and energy free robotic agi running on error-free quantum computers could we move the entire world population into skyscrapers in Texas and save the rest of the environment","completion":"The idea of consolidating the world's population into skyscrapers within a single region like Texas to preserve the rest of the environment is a thought-provoking concept that touches on many practical, ethical, and environmental considerations. While purely theoretical and highly speculative, let's explore the feasibility and implications of such an endeavor: 1. **Population Density**: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the world population is over 7 billion people. Concentrating this number into a single area, even with skyscrapers, would require an incredibly high density. For comparison, the densest city in the world, Manila, has a density of about 41,515 people per square kilometer. Texas is approximately 695,662 square kilometers in area, but even if we assume a smaller area dedicated to living space, the density required to house everyone would be unprecedented. 2. **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure needed to support such a population density would be immense. This includes not just living quarters but also transportation, water supply, sewage and waste management, food production and distribution, healthcare facilities, and various other social services. Even with advanced AGI and abundant energy, the logistics and resources required would be enormous. 3. **Environmental Impact**: While moving humans into a condensed area could, theoretically, reduce the human footprint on the natural environment, the concentration of waste, the heat island effect, and the demand for resources would create significant local environmental challenges. Moreover, the construction of such a massive number of skyscrapers would have a huge environmental impact in terms of material use and emissions. 4. **Social and Psychological Effects**: Humans have diverse needs and preferences for their living environments. Crowding the entire population into high-rise buildings would likely have substantial social and psychological effects. The lack of personal space, potential for increased spread of diseases, and the psychological impact of such high-density living are significant concerns. 5. **Ecosystem Services**: The ecosystems that exist outside human settlements provide invaluable services such as water filtration, carbon sequestration, and pollination. Preserving these ecosystems by relocating humans into dense settlements would still necessitate careful management of these services to support the condensed population. 6. **Political and Ethical Considerations**: The idea of moving everyone into a single area, regardless of their cultural, social, and personal ties to their current homes, poses numerous political and ethical challenges. The question of autonomy, freedom of choice, and the diversity of human cultures and preferences would make such a proposal highly contentious. In conclusion, while using hypothetical advanced technology to concentrate the human population into a small area might seem like a potential way to mitigate environmental impact, the practical, social, and ethical implications make this scenario unlikely and impractical. Sustainable development, environmental conservation, and population management are complex issues that require a multifaceted and decentralized approach. Considerations for quality of life, personal freedoms, and the integrity of global ecosystems must guide our environmental and urban planning strategies."},{"prompt":"What would the potential benefits be","completion":"The hypothetical scenario of moving the world's population into skyscrapers within a region like Texas and having robotic AGI powered by error-free quantum computers involves numerous speculative assumptions. However, assuming these conditions could be met, there could be potential benefits in terms of environmental conservation and resource management: 1. **Environmental Restoration**: With most human activities confined to a small area, vast expanses of the planet could be rehabilitated and rewilded. This could lead to the recovery of ecosystems, increased biodiversity, and the return of native wildlife to areas previously impacted by human development. 2. **Resource Efficiency**: Centralizing the population could lead to more efficient resource distribution, such as energy, water, and food, especially if advanced technologies are employed. It could mean shorter supply chains and reduced transportation emissions. 3. **Reduced Land Use**: By minimizing the geographic footprint of human habitation, more land would be available for sustainable agriculture, conservation, and natural processes like carbon sequestration. 4. **Climate Change Mitigation**: Presumably, with less deforestation and habitat destruction, the revitalized natural areas could help mitigate climate change by acting as carbon sinks and contributing to improved air and water quality. 5. **Innovation in Urban Living**: Such a massive undertaking would necessitate significant advancements in the design of living spaces, urban planning, and the creation of sustainable, self-contained cities that could pioneer new standards for living sustainably in high-density conditions. 6. **Energy Conservation**: High-density living could lead to more efficient energy use, where district heating and cooling systems could serve many homes more efficiently than individual systems. 7. **Potential for Global Unity**: Cooperation on such a grand scale could foster a sense of global unity and shared purpose, potentially leading to a more peaceful and cooperative international community. 8. **Reduction in Infrastructure Sprawl**: Urban sprawl could be eliminated, protecting more natural habitat and reducing vehicle use and infrastructure maintenance costs associated with spread-out population centers. 9. **Focused Innovation and Problem-Solving**: The concentration of resources and minds in a single area might accelerate innovation and problem-solving, particularly if AGI facilitates rapid advancements in technology and science. Despite these potential benefits, the feasibility of such an undertaking remains deeply in question due to the tremendous challenges and complex societal implications mentioned previously. The idea also takes a very utilitarian perspective, which may not align with individual freedoms and cultural preferences. Realistically, a more viable and ethical approach would be to find ways to make existing cities and settlements more sustainable while preserving human diversity and personal choice."},{"prompt":"How big would the skyscrapers need to be to house everyone in Texas based on the tallest skyscraper standards","completion":"To estimate how big skyscrapers would need to be to house the entire world's population within the state of Texas based on the standards of the tallest skyscrapers, let's use some rough calculations and assumptions: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the world's population is over 7.8 billion people. The amount of space required per person can vary greatly depending on living standards, but let's use a modest estimate of 100 square feet (about 9.3 square meters) per person for living space. This number does not account for additional space required for offices, schools, stores, and other amenities, but for simplicity, we will focus only on residential space. 1. Calculate total space required: 7,800,000,000 people * 100 square feet/person = 780,000,000,000 square feet 2. Convert square feet to square kilometers for a larger picture: 780,000,000,000 square feet / 10.7639 (the number of square feet in a square meter) / 1,000,000 (the number of square meters in a square kilometer) ≈ 72,443 square kilometers 3. Now, let's consider the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world as of 2023. It has a total floor area of about 309,473 square meters (3,331,100 sq ft) including all its useable space, not just residential space. 4. Find out how many Burj Khalifas would be needed: 72,443 sq km / 0.309473 sq km (floor area of Burj Khalifa) ≈ 234,168 Burj Khalifas Keep in mind that this crude estimation assumes everyone lives as individuals without shared spaces, which is not realistic. Generally, people live in households with shared living spaces, kitchens, and bathrooms, which can greatly reduce the space requirement per person. However, the calculation doesn't consider space for communal areas like streets, parks, utilities, commercial spaces, etc. Also, Texas has an area of about 695,662 square kilometers, so in theory, the residential space would take up about 10% of its area, leaving the rest for other uses. But this leaves out other infrastructure and facilities necessary to support such a massive population, which would require much more space. In conclusion, while it's a thought-provoking exercise to imagine such a scenario, the practicality of housing the entire world's population in skyscrapers in Texas, or anywhere, faces many significant challenges. Issues such as personal preference, quality of life, logistical considerations, infrastructure needs, and the environmental impact of construction on such a scale would all need to be addressed in a real-world situation."},{"prompt":"I didn't understand how many Burj Khalifas are needed for the world population","completion":"Certainly! Let's recalculate and simplify the steps to determine approximately how many structures equal in size to the Burj Khalifa would be needed to house the entire world's population, based solely on residential space. We'll start with the assumption that we have 7.8 billion people and each person requires approximately 100 square feet of residential space. 1. **Total residential space required**: - 7.8 billion people * 100 square feet per person = 780 billion square feet 2. **Total area of the Burj Khalifa**: - The Burj Khalifa has a total floor area (including all of its uses) of approximately 3.3311 million square feet. 3. **Number of Burj Khalifas needed**: - 780 billion square feet / 3.3311 million square feet per Burj Khalifa ≈ 234,092 Burj Khalifas This calculation estimates that you'd need about 234,092 structures the size of the Burj Khalifa to house 7.8 billion people, under the assumption that each person gets 100 square feet of residential space. Please note that this is a highly simplified calculation and does not take into consideration the actual distribution of space in a residential setting, common areas, services, and infrastructure that would be necessary to support such a population. The real number would be much higher when accounting for all those additional requirements."},{"prompt":"How meny can fit in Texas","completion":"To estimate how many structures the size of the Burj Khalifa could fit in Texas, we need to consider the total land area of Texas and the footprint of the Burj Khalifa, which is different from its total floor area. 1. **Land Area of Texas**: Texas has a land area of approximately 695,662 square kilometers (268,596 square miles). 2. **Footprint of Burj Khalifa**: The Burj Khalifa itself occupies a footprint of approximately 3.32 acres, or 0.01344 square kilometers (1.344e-2 square kilometers). 3. **Setting aside space for infrastructure**: In a real-world scenario, we can't use all of the land for buildings alone. There must be space for roads, utilities, public services, and green spaces. Let's consider using only 25% of Texas's land area for the actual footprints of the buildings. That would leave the remaining 75% for other necessary infrastructure. The land area of Texas we are allocating for building footprints is 25% of 695,662 square kilometers, which equals approximately 173,915.5 square kilometers. 4. **Calculate the number of Burj Khalifas that could fit in the allocated land area**: \`\`\` 173,915.5 sq km / 0.01344 sq km per Burj Khalifa ≈ 12,943,542 Burj Khalifas \`\`\` Based on the simplified calculation, you could theoretically fit around 12,943,542 Burj Khalifa-sized buildings (by footprint) in 25% of the land area of Texas. This calculation assumes we are able to pack the buildings in with no space in between, which is obviously impractical. In reality, the number would be much lower due to the need for space between buildings for roads, parks, and other necessities. Furthermore, not all of Texas's land is suitable for building due to factors such as natural barriers, variability in terrain, privately owned land, protected areas, etc. Therefore, the actual number of skyscrapers that could feasibly be built would be considerably less than this theoretical maximum."},{"prompt":"What is the average capacity of a 10 story apartment building","completion":"The average capacity of a 10-story apartment building can vary widely depending on the design, the size of the apartments, the layout of the building, and local building codes. Here is a general way to approach an estimate: 1. **Average Size of an Apartment**: As a rough estimate, let's use the size of a two-bedroom apartment, which is common in many urban areas. The size can vary significantly, but we'll use 900 square feet (approximately 83.6 square meters) for this estimate. 2. **Number of Apartments per Floor**: This can also vary, depending on the size of the building's footprint. If we assume that 75% of each floor is dedicated to living space (with the rest for elevators, stairwells, and other common areas), and the building has a gross area per floor of 10,000 square feet (about 929 square meters), then we could estimate: \`\`\` (10,000 sq ft per floor * 75% for apartments) / 900 sq ft per apartment ≈ 8 apartments per floor \`\`\` 3. **Total Number of Apartments**: With 8 apartments per floor over 10 stories, we have: \`\`\` 8 apartments/floor * 10 floors = 80 apartments \`\`\` 4. **Occupancy**: If we use an average occupancy of 2.5 people per apartment (which again can vary), we get: \`\`\` 80 apartments * 2.5 people/apartment = 200 people in the building \`\`\` Therefore, a 10-story apartment building with these assumptions would have an approximate capacity of 200 people. This is a very simplified model, and actual capacity will differ based on the many factors previously listed. For actual projects, architects and planners would calculate more accurate numbers based on detailed plans, local building codes, and the intended market for the apartments."},{"prompt":"How meny can fit in Texas","completion":"To determine how many 10-story apartment buildings could fit in Texas, we need to calculate the total area these buildings would occupy and compare it to the available land area in Texas. We'll take a simplified approach similar to the previous Burj Khalifa example, using rough estimates and keeping in mind that the actual number would be impacted by various real-world considerations. 1. **Land Area of Texas**: - Texas has a land area of roughly 695,662 square kilometers (268,596 square miles). 2. **Footprint of a 10-Story Apartment Building**: - Let's assume the building has a gross area per floor of 10,000 square feet, as in the previous example. The footprint would be the same since it's a ten-story building. - To convert the square footage to acres, we have: - 10,000 sq ft / 43,560 (number of square feet in an acre) ≈ 0.22957 acres per building footprint - Now, convert acres to square kilometers: - 0.22957 acres * 0.00404686 (number of square kilometers in an acre) ≈ 0.000929 square kilometers per building 3. **Percentage of Land Used for Buildings**: - If we assume that only 25% of the land area of Texas is used for apartment building footprints, the rest being allocated for infrastructure like roads, parks, utilities, etc., we have: - 0.25 * 695,662 sq km = 173,915.5 sq km 4. **Number of Apartment Buildings That Could Fit in Texas**: - 173,915.5 sq km / 0.000929 sq km per building ≈ 187,314,847 buildings Therefore, if Texas were to be covered with 10-story apartment buildings taking up only 25% of the land area for their footprints, we could theoretically fit approximately 187 million buildings into that allocated space. Please note that this calculation is hypothetical and represents a theoretical maximum. Many factors would inevitably reduce the actual number of buildings that could fit, such as geographical constraints (lakes, rivers, terrain), the need for additional infrastructure, and designated land for agriculture, conservation, commercial use, and other purposes. The calculation also does not account for the required spacing between buildings and other aspects of urban planning that would reduce the density."},{"prompt":"How meny people would it house","completion":"Let's calculate how many people could be housed in Texas if it were filled with 10-story apartment buildings using our simplified assumptions from previous messages. In our earlier example, we estimated a single 10-story apartment building could house about 200 people. We've also estimated that approximately 187 million 10-story apartment buildings could theoretically fit into Texas if 25% of the land were allocated for building footprints. Now we can estimate the total number of people: Number of buildings * People per building = Total capacity 187,314,847 buildings * 200 people/building ≈ 37,462,969,400 people Therefore, in this highly theoretical scenario, Texas could house approximately 37.5 billion people in 10-story apartment buildings, assuming each building houses 200 people and that 25% of the land area is used for the footprints of these buildings. Again, this is a theoretical maximum that doesn't account for the extensive infrastructure, services, and green spaces required for such a population, nor does it consider geographic realities, legal or political constraints, and land use planning requirements. The actual capacity would be much lower when considering these important factors."},{"prompt":"预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺技术水平与传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺对比，主要提现在哪些优势？","completion":"预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺与传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺相比，在以下几个方面具有优势： 1. 施工周期短：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺采用现场预制的砖板，可以提前生产制作，减少施工现场的施工时间，大大缩短工期。 2. 施工质量高：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺在工厂生产的砖板具有统一的规格和品质，避免了现场施工中砖形状不一致、强度不够等质量问题，保证了施工质量的稳定性和可靠性。 3. 施工成本低：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺不需要现场砌筑砖墙和贴铺胎膜，减少了劳动力成本和材料浪费，降低了施工成本。 4. 耐久性好：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中使用的混凝土板具有较好的抗压强度和耐久性，在长期使用中不易受到外界环境的损害，具有较长的使用寿命。 5. 环保节能：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中通过工厂预制生产，减少了现场施工中产生的废弃物和扬尘等环境污染，同时由于砖板的隔热性能较好，能够降低建筑物的能耗，达到节能环保的效果。 综上所述，预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺相比传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺具有施工周期短、施工质量高、施工成本低、耐久性好和环保节能等方面的优势。"},{"prompt":"预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺技术水平与国内传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺，技术水平如何，先进主要体现在哪些方面","completion":"预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺相比于国内传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺，在技术水平方面具有以下先进性: 1. 设计与制作技术：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺要求设计和制作符合工程要求的砖板，需要进行精确的计算和计划，并采用先进的生产制造技术。而传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺相对简单，很大程度上依赖于工人的经验和技能，缺乏精确的设计和制作工艺。 2. 统一规格与质量控制：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，砖板的制作在工厂内进行，具有统一的规格和品质。生产过程中可以严格控制每个砖板的强度、尺寸和质量，保证施工中的一致性和可靠性。而传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，由于砖体砌筑和贴铺是在现场进行的，造成砖形状不一致、强度不够等质量问题较多。 3. 施工效率和周期：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，砖板的制作和加工可以与现场施工并行进行，大大缩短了施工周期。而传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺则需要进行砖墙砌筑和贴铺胎膜等多个施工工序，时间较长。 4. 施工质量和可靠性：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，采用了工厂生产的砖板，保证了砖板的质量稳定和施工质量的一致性。而传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，质量主要依赖于工人的技艺水平，容易出现质量不稳定的问题。 5. 环保节能特性：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，通过工业化生产和预制加工，减少现场施工产生的废弃物和扬尘等环境污染。而传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，现场施工产生的废弃物和扬尘较多。 综上所述，预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺相对于国内传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺在设计制作技术、统一规格与质量控制、施工效率和周期、施工质量和可靠性以及环保节能特性方面都更为先进。"},{"prompt":"预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺技术水平与国内传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺相比，有哪些技术难度","completion":"预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺与国内传统砖胎膜基础施工工艺相比，存在一些技术难度，主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 砖板的设计与制作：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，需要对砖板的尺寸、厚度、材质等进行精确的计算和设计，确保砖板的质量和性能满足工程要求。制作工艺也需要掌握，包括混凝土配比、模具制作和预制加工等技术。 2. 砖板的运输和安装：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺中，砖板需要从工厂运输到施工现场，并进行安装。需要解决砖板的运输方式选择、运输过程中的保护措施以及安装时的精准位置调整等技术难题。 3. 胎膜的施工：虽然预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺不需要现场贴铺胎膜，但在连接砖板和地基的接缝处，还需要进行胎膜的施工，确保接缝处的密封性。这个工序需要精确的施工技术和合适的材料选取，以确保胎膜的质量和可靠性。 4. 工程设计与施工过程的协调：预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺与传统施工工艺有一定的区别，需要在工程设计中进行合理规划，并在实际施工中协调好各个环节。这需要施工队伍具备较高的技术水平和工程管理能力。 需要指出的是，虽然预制混凝土板砖胎膜基础施工工艺存在一些技术难度，但随着技术的不断发展和进步，这些难题有望得到更好的解决或改进。"},{"prompt":"预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材（非沥青基）施工工艺技术水平与国内传统防水卷材施工工艺相比，有哪些技术难度","completion":"预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材（非沥青基）施工工艺技术水平相对较高，相比国内传统防水卷材施工工艺，存在一些技术难度，主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 材料特性的理解和应用：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材采用非沥青基材料，具有特殊的材料性能，如高强度、高弹性、耐化学腐蚀等。施工人员需要深入理解这些特性，合理选择材料和应用方法，确保防水效果和质量。 2. 基层处理和防水层施工：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材的施工需要对基层进行充分的处理，例如清洁、修补、平整等。施工过程中，必须严格按照规范的施工步骤进行，确保材料的粘结牢固、无空鼓和捏褶。 3. 接缝处理和焊接技术：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材的接缝处理尤为重要，需要采用专用的接缝技术，如热风枪焊接、热风枪结合胶条填充等。施工人员必须要熟悉这些技术，掌握合适的焊接温度和速度，确保接缝的密封性和耐久性。 4. 设备和施工环境要求：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材施工过程中，需要使用专用的施工设备和工具，如热风枪、胶槽、胶刀等。此外，施工现场应满足一定的环境要求，如温度、湿度控制等，保证施工的质量和效果。 需要指出的是，预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材施工技术的提高，不仅仅依赖于施工人员的技术水平，也与材料的质量、厂家的技术支持和工程管理等因素密切相关。因此，合理选择材料供应商和施工队伍，进行专业培训和管理，对技术难度进行全面考虑和解决，才能确保施工工艺的水平和防水工程的质量。"},{"prompt":"预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材（非沥青基）施工工艺技术水平与国内传统防水卷材施工工艺相比有哪些优势","completion":"预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材（非沥青基）施工工艺技术水平相对较高，并且相比国内传统防水卷材施工工艺，具有以下几个优势： 1. 施工效率高：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材的施工过程相对简单且快速。自粘胶膜可以直接在基层上铺贴，并且不需要额外的涂胶粘合步骤，大大提高了施工效率。 2. 施工质量稳定：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材在生产过程中可以精确控制材料的品质和施工工艺。胶膜的自粘性能能够确保防水层的紧密贴合，并有效避免由于胶水涂布不均或施工过程中的人为误差等造成的施工质量问题。 3. 无需使用明火：传统防水卷材施工过程中需要使用明火（如沥青的加热），存在安全隐患。而预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材不需要使用明火，从而提高了施工的安全性。 4. 耐久性强：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材具有较强的耐候性和耐化学腐蚀性，能够适应各种复杂的外部环境。同时，胶膜的自修复能力能够有效修复小范围破损，提高了防水层的使用寿命和可靠性。 5. 环境友好：预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材在材料制备和施工过程中无需使用有毒化学材料（如沥青），减少了对环境的污染。此外，使用胶膜也降低了噪音和尘土的产生，提供了一个更清洁和环保的施工环境。 综上所述，预铺反粘高分子自粘胶膜防水卷材施工工艺技术水平相较国内传统防水卷材施工工艺更具优势，体现"},{"prompt":"I am preparing my SCI paper for submission and require assistance in polishing each paragraph.

Give an example of using this method in teaching geography. In which situation using of this method will be the best option?","completion":"One of the geography teaching methods that can effectively reveal the essence, advantages, and disadvantages of a geographical concept is the case study method. This method involves analyzing real-life situations or case studies to understand geographical phenomena, processes, or issues. Example: Using the case study method in teaching geography, students can explore the concept of urbanization in a particular city or region. They can examine the factors that contribute to urbanization, such as population growth, migration, and economic development, and analyze the impacts of urbanization on various aspects, including the environment, infrastructure, and social dynamics. Advantages of the case study method in teaching geography: 1. It promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills as students analyze real-world data and information to understand geographical concepts. 2. It enhances students' research and analytical skills as they gather and analyze data related to the case study. 3. It helps students develop a deep understanding of geographical processes and their implications by exploring specific examples. 4. It allows students to see the interconnectedness between different geographical factors and understand the complexities of real-life situations. Disadvantages of the case study method in teaching geography: 1. It may limit generalizability as case studies focus on specific examples and may not represent the entire range of geographical phenomena. 2. It can be time-consuming as students need to gather and analyze data in detail, which may reduce the scope for covering a wider range of topics. 3. It relies heavily on the availability of relevant case studies and may be challenging to find suitable examples in certain contexts. 4. It requires effective facilitation and guidance from the teacher to ensure that students extract meaningful conclusions from the case study. The case study method is particularly suitable when teaching geography concepts that require a deep understanding of real-world applications. It works best when studying complex geographical phenomena, which may include urbanization, natural disasters, migration patterns, climate change impacts, or resource management. In these situations, the case study method allows students to engage with real-life examples, analyze multi-faceted issues, and develop comprehensive insights into the geographical processes at play."},{"prompt":"Explain the importance of Project Method.","completion":"The Project Method is an educational approach that emphasizes learning through active engagement in real-life, hands-on projects.

references","completion":"Certainly! Here are the basic principles of Processability Theory and Input Hypothesis, along with a few references for further reading: 1. Processability Theory (PT): - Developed by Manfred Pienemann, PT aims to describe how learners acquire linguistic structures. - PT proposes that learners progress through a series of developmental stages as they acquire a language. - Each stage represents an increase in complexity and accuracy of grammatical structures. References for PT: - Pienemann, M. (1998). Language Processing and Second Language Development: Processability Theory. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing. - Pienemann, M., Di Biase, B., & Kawaguchi, S. (Eds.). (2010). Language Acquisition and Development: Proceedings of GALA 2009 (Vol. 1). Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2. Input Hypothesis: - Proposed by Stephen Krashen, the Input Hypothesis suggests that language acquisition occurs through comprehensible input. - According to this hypothesis, learners acquire language naturally when they understand language input that is slightly beyond their current level. - Input should be meaningful, interesting, and relevant to promote language acquisition. References for the Input Hypothesis: - Krashen, S. (1985). The Input Hypothesis: Issues and Implications. London: Longman. - Krashen, S. (1993). The Power of Reading: Insights from the Research. Englewood, CO: Libraries Unlimited. These references should provide you with more detailed information and further exploration of Processability Theory and the Input Hypothesis."},{"prompt":"What's the basic principles of processability theory?","completion":"The basic principles of Processability Theory (PT) include: 1. Language Developmental Sequences: - PT proposes that language acquisition follows a predictable sequence of developmental stages. - Each stage represents a certain level of complexity and accuracy in acquiring grammatical structures. - These stages are universal across different languages and reflect a natural order of language development. 2. Order of Acquisition: - PT suggests that certain grammatical structures are acquired before others, based on their cognitive complexity and developmental readiness. - The order of acquisition is determined by the ease of processing, starting with simpler structures and gradually progressing to more complex ones. 3. Processability Constraints: - PT identifies specific processability constraints that shape the order and sequence of acquiring grammatical structures. - These constraints specify the grammatical features that learners have the cognitive ability to process and produce at specific stages of development. 4. Language Performance: - PT focuses on the performance of learners in producing grammatical structures, rather than merely their understanding or knowledge of the language. - It emphasizes the use of productive tasks to evaluate learners' ability to generate appropriate and accurate language forms. 5. Individual Learner Differences: - PT acknowledges that individual learners may have different rates and patterns of acquisition. - Learners progress through the stages of development at their own pace, influenced by factors such as age, first language background, and language learning context. These principles help explain the natural progression of language development and provide a framework for understanding how second language learners acquire grammatical structures."},{"prompt":"Can you tell me what's the differences and similarities between the Basic Principles of Processability Theory and Input Hypothesis","completion":"Certainly! While Processability Theory (PT) and the Input Hypothesis share some similarities, they also have distinct differences. Here are the key differences and similarities between the basic principles of PT and the Input Hypothesis: 1. Similarity: Stages of Development - Both PT and the Input Hypothesis recognize that language development occurs in stages or sequences. - They propose that learners progress through these stages in a systematic manner. 2. Difference: Focus of Analysis - PT focuses primarily on the internal developmental processes of learners, analyzing the cognitive complexity of grammatical structures and the order of acquisition. - The Input Hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses more on the external input that learners receive and how it contributes to language acquisition. 3. Difference: Nature of Input - PT does not directly emphasize the role of input as the driving force behind language acquisition. - The Input Hypothesis, however, highlights the importance of comprehensible input, suggesting that it is a necessary condition for language development. 4. Similarity: Developmental Constraints - Both PT and the Input Hypothesis acknowledge the presence of constraints on language acquisition. - PT suggests that processability constraints shape the order of acquisition, while the Input Hypothesis proposes the existence of a natural order based on the complexity of input. 5. Difference: Evaluation of Learner Performance - PT places more emphasis on learners' production of grammatical structures in various tasks as an indicator of their language development. - On the other hand, the Input Hypothesis focuses more on learners' ability to understand the input they receive, with less emphasis on production. 6. Difference: Universal Grammar - PT builds on the concept of Universal Grammar, suggesting that there are innate linguistic principles that guide language development. - The Input Hypothesis does not explicitly rely on Universal Grammar, instead emphasizing the importance of input for acquisition. While both PT and the Input Hypothesis offer insights into language acquisition, they approach the topic from different angles, with PT focusing on internal developmental processes and the Input Hypothesis emphasizing the role of comprehensible input."},{"prompt":"不你会","completion":"对不起，可能出错了，我是一个人工智能机器人，不会有真正的情感和知觉，只能根据编程回答问题。如果有什么我能帮助你的，请告诉我。"},{"prompt":"刚刚","completion":"刚刚发生了什么事情？请告诉我，我会尽力帮助你。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Capital and largest city: Dublin (650,000) Flag: A white flag with a red saltire, the St Patrick’s Cross—sometimes defaced with a crowned golden harp on a blue shield for government/royal purposes. Population: 4.8 million.[1] Land area: 5,500 lcf. Economic ranking: A relatively minor part of the Hanoverian Dominions economically, but Ireland’s economy has grown since the 1840s due to the island acting as a useful tax haven compared to Great Britain when trading with European powers. Form of government: Parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The Emperor-King of North America and Great Britain is the theoretical head of state but rarely visits, and in practice the Lord Deputy functions as not only the king’s representative but the de facto king himself. The Parliament of Ireland has grown to be a powerful body, especially given that many Prime Ministers have had to govern without a formal majority; the party system is vague, fractured and MPs will often favour local interests over national policy. Foreign relations: Ireland’s foreign policy has historically largely been dictated by Great Britain, and more recently in practice by the Empire of North America. The growing exception is with trade, where tax policy has been designed by the Irish Government to favour trade deals with European powers such as France. Military: Ireland contributes disproportionately to the wider Anglo-American armed forces, particularly the Army. A few Irish regiments are rotated home to the island periodically, and there is a small dedicated Royal Irish Navy (largely focused on a preventive cutter service to deter smugglers, but with a few capital ships). Mostly, however, Irish forces serve abroad as part of the American-directed policies of protecting Hanoverian trade routes overseas. Current head of state: De jure: King George IV (i.e. Emperor-King George IV of North America and Britain). De facto: James Wesley, 2nd Duke of Dublin. Current head of government: P.

The Indien girl squawked with mock offence and waved a hand at the officer who bedded her each night. He gave her a grin, then caught sight of his reflection in the metal tray and scowled. There was a little too much more salt than pepper in his impressive moustache for his taste these days. Henri felt disapproving eyes on him, and turned to find Lieutenant Émile Maurer peering his way behind his owlish spectacles. Stupid little fool. He reminded Henri of his youthful days bullying such pathetic excuses for boys at the Lycée du Petit-Musc. Of course, that had been before Henri had scraped his way into the École Royale, only to be sent down for some of his harmless youthful escapade. Of the very limited options his father had given him, the Army had seemed like the choice that he could most easily extricate himself from at a later date. That had been fifty years ago. Funny how things worked out. Henri gave Maurer a smile, a knowing smile rather than the flirtatious one he’d given Pilanobigne. “It is important to remain close to the natives, Lieutenant,” he said in a tone that was airy but had an undercurrent of tiresomely correcting a particularly slow pupil. “Remember the stories of the Russians in Gavaji? And that was only the latest case. The natives will plot against you unless you put yourself in a position where you can become aware of their machinations. Where they have no privacy.” He folded his arms. Maurer nodded, the doubt vanishing from his eyes. “Of course, mon colonel. It all makes sense when you put it like that,” he added earnestly. Earnest lieutenants. Henri had known a lot of earnest lieutenants in his time serving the King (or, at least, that was what the inscriptions on his medals said he had been doing). Most of those earnest lieutenants were six pieds beneath the earth now, mouldering away in all sorts of abortive outposts of empire across the terraqueous globe. And Henri lived on. “What news from the perimeter?” Henri asked lightly, pouring himself a drink. It was watered cidre; even with most of the Île du Dufresne’s orchards under rebel control, enough remained to the loyalist forces holed up in Paloua to produce sufficient alcoholic beverages to stave off a mutiny. Maurer clicked his heels and stared at a point six pouces above Henri’s left ear as he spoke, as though a child reciting a Sunday school lesson. “Captain Andrieux reports that the rebels are in full flight after our counterattack against Pain-de-me Hill.” The Army had long since given up referring to the countless anonymous geographical features near the Baie des Émeux which housed the port of Paloua: instead, nicknames suggested by individual soldiers had grown up and been pasted on the maps. Rather tellingly, most of those nicknames were of items of food. The men had cidre, but the shipments of rations from Béron in Pérousie had grown more infrequent lately.[2] Foraging here in the Île du Dufresne itself was not an option: the rebel uprising had largely been driven by both the white convicts and the natives hunting the kangourou and other local food animals to near-extinction. Annoyingly, both groups had chosen to blame the authorities and united against them.[3] Henri adopted a theatrical frown. “Captain Andrieux would be wise not to take too much for granted,” he said portentously, waving his glass of cidre for effect. “De Chardeaux and his men are, by this point, no amateurs. Apparent retreat has been a ploy used by armies since before France existed.” There was some sincerity to his words; a man could not serve (against his will) in flashpoints across the world for fifty years without learning something of warfare. Henri also spoke his mind because he had learned that it was always best to appear keen, restless, unsatisfied. Never let any man ponder whether, actually, this brisk hero of the Kingdom of the French might not prefer to quietly retire to the job of corporate inspector of the wine cellars and harems of the bribed Indian potentates of Senhor Oliveira’s lands. That gig’s probably gone now, too, Henri reflected bitterly; the Company had ceased to be a Meridian front and these days was more subject to FEIC influence, meaning there was more chance he’d run into someone he knew. Oh, well. Maurer nodded urgently. “Yes, sir!” All his earlier hints of doubt had vanished. “We will be on watch for any dastardly rebel scheme!” Henri gave him a look out of the corner of his eye, but as far as he could tell, Maurer was entirely sincere. Raised on bloodies, doubtless, where the brave hero always got the girl at the end, rather than getting knifed in the kidneys in the penultimate chapter so Henri could steal both girl and credit. “You do that, Lieutenant,” he said, and took another pull of cidre. He took out the ornate spyglass he had taken from the still-cooling body of the former Dewan of Khilchipur, back in ’63, or had it been ’64? It all blurred into one now. The spyglass was no mere artistic toy, and did its job as well as any modern Belgian telescope. Yes, as he’d suspected, the rebels over on Fougasse Ridge were laying low, but had entirely failed to break and flee the way one would expect if Andrieux’s report had been accurate. He could see both white and black faces, and some in between: convicts had been breeding with the natives for a while now. One of the old hands here had told him that the natives had suffered badly from disease in the early days, and might have been wiped out save for some crazy heterorthodox Jacobin prisoner who’d decided to create a breeding programme back in the ’fifties. Who knew if he’d been trying to breed a future slave race for his mad dream to emulate Lisieux or whatever; right now, he had managed to create a population that had outgrown the island’s ability to feed it. Maurer blew out a breath, and there was a faint wisp of white. When Henri had been badgered into this latest posting, he’d thought at least Pérousie was nice and warm, not like his adventures down in Patagonia or up in Yapon. He had clearly not read as far as the Île du Dufresne in the cyclopaedia. “At least the météo says it will get warmer now,” the young lieutenant said hopefully. Henri resisted the urge to snort: the weather officer was the sort of man who’d manage to stay perpetually drunk if he’d been assigned on a diplomatic mission to Baghdad, or to the lunatic state of the Little Caliph of Ratnapourée (before Henri had blown him up back in ’73, or was it ’72?) Either way, he wasn’t willing to take his word for anything. “Let us hope,” was all he said. Maurer shuffled his feet and hugged his greatcoat tighter around his dull blue uniform, a far cry from the smart, gorgeously decorated ones Henri had worn in his youth. “While we wait to be relieved, sir, might I ask you to share more stories of your great adventures?” Henri quirked an eyebrow at that. “You know I don’t like to talk about such things—and besides, my role in them was very minor,” he said, accurately. It was always easier not to have to remember an unnecessary lie, not when there were so many necessary ones he had to keep in mind. “Oh, go on, sir, please,” Maurer asked urgently. Henri sighed and drained his glass of watered cidre. “No need for ice out here,” he said, noting the condensation on the outside of the glass. “A far cry from what we used to have to do to keep our drinks cold in Nouvelle-Orléans—to say nothing of up the Mississippi...” He launched into the oldest and best tale, the one which had made his name; the one which he had the most practice in recounting the ‘official’ version. He told the tale of Colonel Bascou’s mistake and the embarrassing retreat down the Mississippi in which one soldier after another had succumbed to the Louisianan rebels or to disease and deprivation. Only one man had survived, bringing the regimental colours with him, to save France’s honour and inspire General Dufaux’s counterattack at Calcasieuville. That man had been the young Ensign Henri Éclatier. By now, Henri had almost forgotten the real events, had heard the official version repeated so much by both himself and others. Grand Duc Jean-Luc was long since food for the frogs and catfish in some bayou somewhere, and no-one now lived who knew that Henri had been desperately pleading for his life when he had supposedly been defiantly raising those colours. That had only been the start, of course, but a life of cowardice and self-interest had led him through trouble spots from then, on down through the Great Jihad and the Euxine War and the Liaodong Incident—and many more—and out the other side. He had survived, but his attempts to seek his fortune by unscrupulous means had rarely proved lasting, and now he found himself here, at the bottom of the world, during a global war in which France, in her infinite wisdom, had chosen to remain neutral. Yet, with these rebels (which he was sure barely merited half a paragraph on page 94 of Le Globe), he was just as likely to be slain here than if he was fighting on the front lines of a conflict where it was at least possible he might be able to appropriate somebody’s treasures. De Chardeaux and his men didn’t even have enough food, never mind any luxuries. Something of Henri’s melancholy thoughts must have infected his story. Maurer was shaking his head. “A great victory, but it all came to naught, didn’t it?” he said sadly. “We lost Nouvelle-Orléans after the big storm, the Meridians basically got it, and now—” “And now the Americans have it, yes,” Henri said. “But take heart; it wasn’t worth having anyway.” He glanced around the cold, desolate island of Dufresne. “One might say.” Maurer opened his mouth to respond, but something caught Henri’s eye. In one motion the spyglass was to his eye again. Yes. Over there, at the fortified position the men called Croissant Crest, where half the remaining guns were located...that native servant bringing a barrel of cidre...now, Henri had a good memory for faces regardless of race, and he was pretty certain that he hadn’t— Henri leapt to his feet, but before he had even left his makeshift seat, fire and smoke had consumed Croissant Crest. There was an instant’s worth of delay before the sound of the explosion hit them. “Sabotage!” Henri cried. “That native had a bomb...” He hesitated. He hadn’t thrown a bomb, and it must have been big...the barrel! But surely the man...no, he hadn’t tried to escape. He had blown himself up along with his victims, like some of the fanatics Henri had fought in India and Africa. Dammit! “To arms,” he ordered, already suspecting it was too late. Yes, those allegedly fleeing rebels were back, the guns were destroyed or tipped over onto their side, bullets were zinging overheard— To cut a long story short, Henri and Maurer (who he had eventually managed to persuade to retreat) found themselves on the harbourfront, French ships fleeing with surviving soldiers and loyalist civilians aboard. Shopkeepers in Paloua town were already hastily altering their signs and taking down the gold, blue, white and red flag of France. What were the rebels using again? A white diamond on black, wasn’t it? Maybe they’d get more creative when they could afford more dyestuffs, the back of Henri’s mind gibbered. “What do you mean that’s the last ship?!” He managed to keep his voice steady and not turn into the shriek that echoed inside his head. A coughing bang from across the street hinted that a rebel with an old Mauré flintlock had drawn close. A young French soldier fell from a balcony, shot through the head. “That’s the last one,” Maurer confirmed, biting his lip. “They had two places left, but I obviously gave them up to these two young ladies who needed to—” “You idiot!” Henri yelled, his eyes wide with rage. “Do you think they’ll—” Then a grenade, its fuse trailing smoke behind it in the air, landed nearby and detonated. When Henri awoke, he found a familiar face looking down on him. Slightly familiar, at least, though in the ‘wanted’ posters it had been a rather amateurish sketch from a bad asimcon. “M. de Chardeaux,” he managed feebly. He moved his limbs cautiously, found himself bruised but with nothing broken. Yet another Éclatier miracle, he thought half-bitterly. “That’s Consul de Chardeaux to you,” De Chardeaux said. He had once been a rather plump bourgeois intellectual who had run afoul of the law for some of his more...unorthodox tastes, but almost five years of fighting in the Desperate Isle had made him lean and mean, his clothes hanging on his frame. A fire burnt in his eyes. Like Dashwood long before him, he had found his calling. Henri nodded weakly. “Consul, then. Your Excellency, whatever. You’ve won.” He gestured feebly with one hand. “Colonel!” So Maurer, the fool, had survived as well. For now. If the rebels didn’t kill him, Henri would. “Don’t say that! You know they’re doomed when reinforcements come! We have the whole Empire behind us!” De Chardeaux opened his mouth, but Henri spoke first. “No, Lieutenant,” Henri said wearily. “Just as Villon left Dufaux out to dry over Louisiana, because worrying about the Saxons was more important. Now it’ll be winding up the war in Europe, worrying about the Russians, all that stuff.” He yawned. “Colonial wars will never be a top priority. They just tell you that in the École Militaire so you won’t ask awkward questions.” “Colonel!” Maurer sounded distraught. “You make it sound as though none of it matters!” Henri met De Chardeaux’s eye, and nodded to him. The Consul was a man of the world and would share a cynical nod at the naÏvité of the youth, he was certain. Maybe he blinked, but De Chardeaux didn’t seem to return it. “Well,” the Consul said. “All that remains is for us to send a suitable message to Pérousie, to Paris, to make it clear that we are not to be trifled with.” “I will take your message,” Henri said quickly. “Colonel!” Maurer cried for the third time. “You would never—” “How d’you think I got out of the Emir’s dungeons on Zanzibar, Lieutenant?” Henri asked. “Or brought General Dumont’s head back from the battlefield in Sarawak? Or—” “Yes, Lieutenant,” De Chardeaux cut him off. “Your heroic Colonel Éclatier is not who you thought he was. He is, however, a survivor. One who outlives all he has served with.” De Chardeaux drew a sword, an orphaned bayonet with a hand-modified hilt really, and advanced towards Maurer. The young man’s eyes widened. “Yes, toodle-pip, Lieutenant,” Henri said cheerfully. “If you’ve got any message you’d like me to take your family, don’t worry, I’ll make up something much better, about how I saved you from the Consul here only for you to heroically die of your wounds on the boat home.” Maurer gave him a betrayed look, his whole worldview visibly crumbling around him. De Chardeaux paused. “I’m sorry, I didn’t make myself clear,” he said pleasantly. “I said we needed to send a message to Paris. That we are not to be trifled with. That we are stronger than any of the minor inconveniences France has had to cope with over the years.” He turned in one smooth motion and stabbed Henri up under the breastbone and through the heart. “Of course, we will need someone to tell France just what happened to her great hero of tall tale,” he added, heedless of the bubbling red liquid staining his arms. “I see a great future for you, Lieutenant.” It was at times like this, Henri thought as the world went black, that he really wished he’d written some of this down. El Pueblo del Cometa, Adamantine Republic of California November 5th 1899 Caro Deakin woke suddenly from her sleep. She lay there, puzzled, staring at the ceiling of her bedroom, uncertain what had woken her. The thick curtains at the window could not entirely block the flickering luftlights of Cometa’s districts that never slept, downhill from here at the summit of quiet, respectable Unzaga Hill.[4] On a clear day she could see all the way to Fowler Street, beyond Veliky Street. But that was always the case, and she usually slept soundly enough. That thought buzzed annoyingly in her mind for a long moment, like a mosquito, while she considered and discarded other things that might have woken her up. Had he...no. What about...no, she would still be hearing that now. Or... Her mind, still sluggish from her abrupt awakening, finally caught up. Yes, she could see all the way to Fowler Street. Hear all the way there as well, though the windows were built with a double glass layered sash to try to reduce the noise of the street outside. Yet right now, she heard nothing. And it was the night of the Fifth of November. She was hit by a sudden glimpse of memory. Exactly three years ago, she had rode her celeripede on one of the countless urgent errands of the day, to—hadn’t it been Young Tompkins and his now late father? Yes, she thought so. That was where she’d first heard the rumour of war. Though, at that time, none could have guessed how huge, how terrible, how all-encompassing it would become. Least of all Caro. She remembered thinking—such a young, naÏve girl!—that at least California would remain untouched by the conflict, thanks to the wise policy of neutrality that was one of the few things the Consuls and the Senate could agree on. Well, as far as a child’s understanding went, as far as lines drawn on a map went, she had been correct. California had indeed resisted all attempts by Americans, Meridians and Russians to be drawn into the war on one side or another. The Consuls had even rejected overtures from the French to join their Marseilles Protocol: even organised neutrality was insufficiently neutral for good Californians. No Californians had been ordered to march to war. Yet many young men had nonetheless done so, whether through holding old loyalties to their fathers’ and grandfathers’ homelands, or simply for the adventure of it. Caro couldn’t understand the first of those motivations. She remembered two young lads she had known slightly when she had been working as a courier. One of them, George, had tried to impress her with his own celeripede skills, before realising she would always leave him in the dust. George hadn’t cared that Caro’s late father was a Carolinian who had named her after his homeland, while George’s own father was American. He also hadn’t cared that the other lad, Ramón, had been descended from Meridians. They had all gotten on as friends, and it had felt as though California was heralding the wave of the future, in which boundaries between nations would be increasingly less important. But that was then, and this was now. George and Ramón had both left California to join their ancestors’ respective armies. Neither had returned. For all she knew, they had slain each other in combat outside the ruins of Charleston—whose fate Caro couldn’t bring herself to care about, even though her grandfather might have lived there. It was too far removed from her experience. Yet George and Ramón had thought otherwise. And now they were both, maybe, gone. Caro turned over in her bed, snuggling into her fine duck-feather pillow as though she could block out the memories. The second motivation. Adventure. That she could understand. There were rumours that a few girls, ‘disciples of La Zorra’ as the doradist papers disparagingly called them, had disguised themselves as boys and joined foreign armies. Rumours like that always circulated in wartime, older acquaintances had told her, and were occasionally even true. Caro had never been tempted because she recoiled from the idea of war and violence, but she could imagine the appeal of seeing the world. She had fantasised about it herself, in those long days of peace. She had always taken pride in being a Californian, living in the place in the world where, perhaps, a woman had more opportunities to set her own destiny than anywhere else. But nonetheless she had loved the idea of having the money to travel, sometimes in comfort, sometimes by her wits alone. She had devoured bloodies telling far-fetched tales of intrepid adventurers who explored mysterious and deadly places like Punjab or the Deep Congo, or who were on the run from the secret police of Portugal or Corea. She’d always been intelligent enough to know that such fictional adventures could not be like the real thing, but she had dreamed nonetheless. One day. When she had saved enough money from her courier work, maybe had a flutter on the stock exchange and won big...they had been idle dreams, but she had liked them. Not forever, of course. She’d see the world, conclude by the end that California was the best place in the world as she had always known, and then return in triumph through the Hidden Gate and marry and settle down. Caro looked back over her shoulder, her hair obscuring her vision for a moment. He was snoring softly. Mikhail was a good man, a wealthy man who would have been just as generous if he had been poor, Caro knew. Her called her Karolinka, or just Kara, and the look in his eyes when he said it was...smouldering. He was good-looking, too, in a slightly rough-edged way which he softened with his large Mexican-style moustache, and never raised his hand to her. He gave her a say in the running of his business, and now she was of age to vote, he had never tried to tell her how to use her right. Most women the world over, she reflected vaguely, would kill for her marriage. Hell and tarnation, even most Californian women would. She had no complaints about Mikhail. So why... That silence was getting eerie, and Mikhail’s snores only seemed to deepen it. The Americans were not celebrating Bonfire Night. Had the Catholic Church complained again to the Senate? But they’d been doing that since before Caro had been a little girl, and it had never made much difference. The Meridian community had sometimes complained as well (even though many of them were Jansenists who would be just as keen to burn the Pope in effigy as the Protestant Americans were) but now the Torchies and their descendants living in Cometa were keeping decidedly quiet. The war was lost for their homeland, that was clear, and it was just a matter of time before they sued for peace. Judging by what the papers said, the Americans would have to send their big fleet and all their new British volunteers to beard the lion in his den before Monterroso would throw in the sponge. So the Torchies being quiet, not celebrating their independence day or Riquelme’s birthday or whatever, that made sense. But why were the Septens doing the same? Mikhail made a small noise in his sleep as his moustache tickled him, but dozed off again before he could awake. Caro smiled to herself, but then her smile became fixed. Mikhail. Mikhail was the answer. Him, and the other vitches in Cometa. The balance of power had shifted, subtly but unmistakably. The Americans had quietly conceded defeat in the West to the Tsar so they could focus on smashing the Torchies into the ground. ‘Defeat’ would be criticised by any sensible person as grotesquely overstating the case, of course. Caro might be accused of spouting Petrograd’s propaganda for using the word. At the nadir of American fortunes in the North West, the Russians had penetrated deep into Superior and some alarmist papers had suggested they were going to reach the Great Lakes. The Americans had easily beaten them back and there was talk that their ‘temporary occupation’ of Superior might turn into an annexation, making it much harder for the Russians to push eastward in any future war. But, nonetheless, though the more American-sympathetic papers tried to avoid mentioning it, the Empire of North America had lost ground against the ambitions of the Tsar—and the RLPC—since the start of the war. A big chunk of the largely empty lands east of New Siberia that the Superior Republic had formerly claimed had now been added to the Russian crown rather than to the American, and the northern half of Noochaland—still determinedly Russian-occupied till the end of the war by troops eating their own boots, or so rumour claimed—was the new jewel in Fyodorsk’s crown. From a Californian perspective, though, the worst of all was that the Americans had handed over a chunk of the Maltinomack province of the Confederation of Drakesland along California’s northern border, including the town of Two Ton Port.[5] The Septens probably thought that the small and isolated port, now renamed Shemeretvsk, would wither on the vine without a railway connecting it to the rest of Russian America. They were probably right, but if so, it was an illustration (as Caro had seen many times in Californian politics) of how a cool-headed cost-benefit analysis could be shattered by the fervour of democracy. People had panicked when the treaty had first been announced, and now there was talk of the RLPC’s Pacific fleet making a stop in the Hidden Gate as part of a ‘friendship tour’ once the last fronts of the war were over. The Russians had always been a presence in Meridian politics, going back to Pozharsky’s intervention in the fight for independence, but since the ENA had expanded up to California’s borders, they had played second fiddle for all of Caro’s life. Now, suddenly, they had displaced the Americans for the top spot. And that changed everything. Right down to excited little boys and girls on Fowler Street being told by their mothers that they couldn’t have their firecrackers this year. Right down to the young vitch boys swaggering through the streets like they owned the place, daring others to disagree. Caro wondered what Orthodox Christmas in January would be like now. Her train of thought was interrupted when she heard a baby’s cry. Oh. Of course. Little Sofia. It hadn’t been some maudlin thought of the past that had woken her up, but a mother’s instinct. Hope for the future, not the past. She thought of the periodicals that had started showing the new year as a baby, with the passing old year as an old man. She’d seen one recently that portrayed 1900, the herald of a new century, as a child with a crown of olive branches, accepting the torch from the battered old veteran on crutches that was 1899. Caro levered herself out of the bed, disentangled herself from the sheets and tried not to disturb Mikhail. She put her slippers on, though even in December Cometa was often warm enough that she didn’t feel the need, but didn’t bother putting a robe over the petticoat she slept in. Mikhail had wanted them to get a wetnurse, but that had always felt too cold and impersonal to Caro. Well...and too upper-class. She might be of Carolinian stock, but her grandfather hadn’t been one of the slaveholding aristocracy. He’d come to Carolina to seek his fortune in gold and silver. Caro looked down on the fragile little baby in her knitted woollen suit. It felt like Caro had become as adept with her needles these days as she had once been with her celeripede, now lying dormant at the back of the garage where Mikhail kept his steam mobile. One day, she knew, he would suggest to her that she sell it for parts or gift it to a friend. She knew it with the crushing inevitability that a man with a bloody phthitic cough knew his days were numbered. She cradled little Sofia in her arms, checked that she did not need changing—no, nor did she need burping, she was just scared. Perhaps. Caro rocked her child back and forth, whispering soothingly to her. Sofia slowly quieted and made a little noise that might have been a sigh of satisfaction. Caro wondered what Mikhail could think if he could see into her thoughts right now. Maybe he’d think she was one of those madwomen who strangled their own babies. He’d be horrified if he stopped at the superficial level, that part of her hated and resented this child. Only part of her. She loved Sofia too, and with all of Caro’s heart, she was proud to be this child’s mother. Marrying a man like Mikhail, having a daughter like Sofia, that had always been part of her dream. Perhaps five years from now. After she had travelled the world, proved her independence as a proud Californian woman who didn’t need a man to protect her. After she had seen all their was to see, and had returned home to settle down. Maybe those plans had always been unrealistic. But now she would never know. The war. The hopeful girl she’d once been had been right to guess that California hadn’t got directly involved, though there had been shortages of foods and other things she’d always taken for granted, shaky banks, unstable cities wracked by riots. But the war had done other things. It had closed off the world to her, closed it off in those precious years of youth in which she felt she could do anything. She had met Mikhail, fallen in love, had a child. She did not regret it, on one level. But...not now. It shouldn’t have been now. It should have been...after... Caro, Caro Deakin, Gospodina Karolina Sokolova as her cheque book called her, made a mental note to wash her face before she returned to bed. She did not want her husband to taste salt on her lips the next time he kissed her. If Mikhail woke up, perhaps he would assume that all the sounds of crying belonged to Sofia. Córdoba, Córdoba Province, United Provinces of South America December 31st 1899 “I still think we should at least tell him,” Jorge Suárez murmured, in the tone of someone who knows they will be talked out of it. Bartolomé Jaimes laughed. “At this point? He will shoot you as soon as you say the word Priestley, and you know it. He won’t wait to hear what we intend to do with Señor Priestley’s remarkable achievements—combined with others from other companies which he shut down just when they were about to make war-winning breakthroughs.” As always, he sounded a bit distasteful when he used phrases like ‘war-winning’, but it couldn’t hide the air of triumph in his eyes. “Afterwards, then,” Suárez said. “If we survive.” He had come right from the Cortes Nacionales. It was looking rather bare these days after the latest round of arrests. “Afterwards,” Jaimes agreed. He was hovering indecisively by a pneumatic message tube that sat on a desk at one side of this meeting house, beside a window looking across the street. “But we spoke of the time for action.” He unrolled a crumpled message from a capsule. “We have confirmation on the Americans’ staging post. Everything is in place. We must not miss this opportunity.” He glanced at Suárez. Suárez let out a long breath. “I wish you could explain what this involved in more detail,” he complained, “but as I told you from the start, at this point I’m willing to try anything. The Yanquis breathing down our necks in Buenos Aires…” He shuddered with that ancestral revulsion. “Not another Castelli. Not again. Anything is better than that.” A pregnant pause seemed to stretched to infinity, as the hissing luftlights dimly lit the room with its dusty, slightly old-fashioned wallpaper and tables. “Then?” Jaimes asked quietly. Suárez nodded. “Tonight, then.” Jaimes took a new, flat piece of paper from his pocket—it was printed with a standard message form—and passed it over to Suárez. “Here. Write these words…” Suárez dipped his pen in the inkwell and scratched away, following Jaimes’ instructions. At the end, he looked down at the little message form. DECEMBER 31st ’99. CÓRDOBA. AUTHORISATION: LAUNCH SCIENTIFIC ATTACK. CONFIRM: LAUNCH SCIENTIFIC ATTACK. J. SUÁREZ, FOREIGN MINISTER.​ He carefully added his signature. Jaimes almost impatiently grabbed the form, blew the ink dry and blotted it, then curled the paper into a cylinder and inserted it into the capsule. The capsule was slotted into the pneumatic tube, the cap slid down and Jaimes pulled the lever. There was the usual clunking hiss, and the message was on its way. Suárez sighed. “It’s done. I just wish he knew about this new artillery targeting system of yours...” * Córdoba, Córdoba Province, United Provinces of South America December 31st 1899 Antonio Ramírez looked very different without his archepiscopal robes, Álvaro Monterroso thought. The Archbishop of Buenos Aires was just a man, a man whom one might pass on the street without recognition. Perhaps he found that useful. “I am glad you have come over to our side,” he said, feeling a little thrill at the thought. He had carefully blocked out all thoughts of the wider war. No, all that matter now was winning the internal war, crushing the traitors who had hamstrung the UPSA at every turn. They would be dealt with, not afterwards, but now, so that this could never happen again. Winning a figure as important, as seemingly belonging to the establishment, as Ramírez was important. Ramírez shrugged. “I have always been on the same side, Your Excellency. The side of the poor and the needy. When I feed the poor, they called me a saint. When I asked why the poor had no food, they called me a Mentian extremist.” “You are right, of course,” Monterroso said. “Too much of our history has been the wealthy and powerful covering themselves in Christ and ignoring what his teachings said about those who behave like them.” He sighed. “I have done what I can in the cause of the people. I fear it is not enough.” “Because of the Americans,” Ramírez said quietly. “No matter what you do for our people, the war is lost.” Monterroso glared at him, then seemed to crumble. He looked down, and quietly, for the first time even to himself, he admitted it. “Si.” He felt a strong, paternal hand on his shoulder. “It doesn’t have to be,” Ramírez said softly. Monterroso looked up at him and frowned. “What? How? If this is like another of Jorge’s ridiculous suggestions to get the French Vulture to mediate, as though they would do anything than steal the corporate octopus’ old vassals for their own colonies—” “I wouldn’t know what the Foreign Minister is thinking, I have seldom met him,” Ramírez said soothingly. “I speak of a different plan. The American force ready to march on Buenos Aires is mostly Englishmen. Vetomundines. They are not enthusiastic about fighting for the Emperor over the sea…” Monterroso frowned. “What do you suggest?” Ramírez smiled. “There are alienists who have created messages that will encourage these Englishmen to break away from their Emperor and join our side. Just as our people were conditioned for so many years to accept the Unionist and Adamantine duopoly even as their lives grew worse, until you broke them out of it.” The President-General had been opening his mouth to say that the claim was absurd. But then he shut it, and thought. Well, it was certainly true that the people had been fooled for so many years...and he had seen those rumours about upheavals in old England... “What must we do?” he asked cautiously. “Everything is already ready,” Ramírez said. “It has been kept secret from the Army, who dislike the idea of loyalty being manipulated, but all is in place. Because alienism is a science, we have dubbed it the Scientific Attack. All we need is your written authorisation...” * Nr. Ciudad Bautista, Buenos Aires Province, United Provinces of South America[6] December 31st 1899 “Happy New Year,” grunted Sergeant Cobham as he shoved a half-empty pack of cigarettes in Corporal Axel Morris’ vague direction. Sweat showed on his face; it still felt bizarre for it to be New Year’s Eve in midsummer, down here in the southern hemisphere where everything was back to front. Axel took the cigarettes, opened his mouth to mention any number of things—that it was only 11:15 pm local time, that he had just gifted Cobham these cigarettes for Christmas a week before, and that the pack had been full then—then closed it again. “Happy New Century.” His real gift from Cobham was the sergeant’s grudging respect, after that miserably violent struggle with those militiamen in and around the farmhouse on the 20th, when Dob Hackham had bought it—and that, after making it through the meat grinder that had been the descent on the beaches and the seizure of Ciudad Bautista. Axel had talked with Dob (he still didn’t know the man’s real first name, and now never would) about what genius among the brass had decided that here was the ideal staging ground for an attack on Buenos Aires. They had debated whether it was a Virginian upper-class twit who just noticed it was close on his map, or maybe some earnest Yankee Ivy League graduate in spectacles, just out of short trousers, who felt it would be oh so historically fitting given this was where General Clinton had occupied ninety-two years ago, when America had humiliated the UPSA in the Third Platinean War. Though Axel was not a particularly educated man, he was a product of the opportunity for working-class knowledge enrichment that was the legacy of Populist rule in Great Britain, and he knew that Clinton had suffered a temporary, but in the end irrelevant, defeat from Meridian soldiers led by Miguel Bautista when he had tried to attack Buenos Aires. It did seem like the sort of thing that some Jonathan with a chip on his shoulder would decide to right as a historical wrong. Maybe even a descendant of Clinton, or some other officer at the battle, who saw erasing a stain on his family history as the most important thing here. And who cared how many English troops he had to slaughter to achieve it? Axel shook the thought aside. There had been a lot of important messages from General Strawbridge lately, stating that the Meridians were using propaganda to try to divide the armies of the Hanoverian Dominions. The messages described this as ‘their age-old tactic seen so many times over the years’, as though Britons and Americans were two different tribes in a jungle in Celebes or something. Axel had only seen one example of the alleged propaganda, claiming that the American Government was looking the other way when mauvecoat thugs back home were massacring civilian food rioters. Obviously made up, he told himself insistently to avoid thinking about it. Though for a Meridian production, the English had been very authentically British... “They won’t last much longer,” Cobham declared, startling Axel from his reverie. Cobham was looking south, away from the seething occupied city of Ciudad Bautista behind them with its vital industry, and towards the glow on the horizon that was the metropolis of Buenos Aires, one of the biggest cities in the world. Fighting through those streets would be like trying to fight through London, Axel thought, and shuddered at the idea. “I hope you’re right,” he murmured. “I’m always right,” Cobham said with utter sincerity. He began counting on his fingers, including the one that was half missing since some Brazilian-Portuguese conscript had shot it off three weeks ago. “One, they lost a lot of their best troops in Carolina, killed or captured. Two, they lost another load when Mexico fell so quickly. Three, their fleet is smashed, and what’s left has scattered to the four corners of the globe. Four, they’ve tried calling in their debts from their little friends around the world, but they’re not returning their calls.[7] Five, they can’t enforce their will on Brazil or Peru or whoever because they don’t have the troops to do it.” Cobham looked triumphant. “The world can see that their whole damn so-called Hermandad, brotherhood, was really just the Torchies bullying a load of countries into line, and when someone knocks them down then the others are folding.” Axel nodded. If there was one thing he would concede that Cobham was a world-class authority on, it was bullying. He tried not to think about what those propaganda writers would say about the ENA’s relationship with the other Hanoverian Dominions, mind you. “They still have enough forces to put up a good defence of Buenos Aires,” he pointed out. “Aye, it’ll be a hard fight,” Cobham agreed, sounding as though he relished it. “But without Buenos Aires they’re nothing—I doubt we’ll even have to take Córdoba. Monterroso will throw in the sponge, you just wait and see. Get ’em to the negotiating table...” A dangerous light shone in his eyes, “and then we’ll really take ’em apart.” Axel nodded fervently. Sometimes Cobham scared him even more than the Americans. At least the Jonathans had one of their daft historical reasons for justifying their hatred of the Meridians. Messages had circulated throughout the army declaring how proud the soldiers’ fathers and grandfathers would be, those who had suffered through the Meridian victories of the Great American War, to now see the UPSA humbled. Axel wasn’t so sure about that. Maybe for the Americans who had occupied Montevideo and Recife. Not so much the mostly British force here in Ciudad Bautista; he knew that those Englishmen who had fought in the Great American War had mostly been rather unenthusiastic about it, not unlike how he felt now. Certainly not the Carolinian-recruited force that had been flung pointlessly at Caracas to try to assuage Princess Daniela’s faction of support at the Fredericksburg court. I wish England had one of those, Axel thought cynically. “I just hope we make it out alive,” he murmured. “There’s a girl in Southampton...” Though that was probably overstating the case. Nonetheless, Cobham punched him manfully on the shoulder. “You’ll make it back to her, Morris,” he barked. “I order you to. If you die on me, I’ll have you flogged to death!” He barked laughter at that, and Axel had to smile; besides the obvious logical impossibility, no British sergeant had had the right to flog his men since the Inglorious Revolution. Cobham always managed well enough with the lash of his tongue to destroy them alienistically. “Cheers,” Axel said and shared a bit of his hip-flask in return for the cigarettes. It was German-style lager, popular in the UPSA just as in the ENA, both sharing many German immigrants. He wondered sourly whether anyone had bothered to check whether Americans of German blood were conniving with their fellows in the UPSA. But men like that ‘Ya’-spouting Henry Smith back on the Commissioner—the HBMS Commissioner—were probably considered above suspicion. The right sort of chaps. Good Liberal or, these days, even Supremacist voters. Axel glanced at the watch strapped to his wrist and started. It was 11:40 now. He didn’t want to fill his mind with resentment as the nineteenth century ended. So it would end with blood, as it had been born, in the days of Lisieux and the Jacobin Wars. So be it. That was the world, that was the human condition. Almost unconsciously, he’d been staring south towards the hazy lights of Buenos Aires, much like Cobham. Despite the glare from those lights, though, Axel had discovered he had good night vision during this campaign. It had saved his life more than once. And so, faintly silhouetted against the sky, he thought he saw... He blinked. “What in the world are those?” * Ignacio Cabrera accepted a kiss from Valeria as she handed him something. “For luck,” she said, blushing. At first he thought it looked like the icon of a saint, the sort of thing far more beloved of backwards Roman immigrants than good Jansenist Catholics, but then he realised that was not a cross, but the three-legged eye symbol, and the face was the frowning intellectual one of Pablo Sanchez. No wonder Valeria blushed—she usually prided herself on her clean, logical approach to the world, free from superstitions like this. But she had softened as they had grown closer over the last few months. Despite his leg, despite everything, they had been the happiest months of Ignacio’s life. “Thanks,” he said softly. “I love you.” “I know,” Valeria said with a wink. “Come back and I’ll tell you the same.” He grinned at her, then finished awkwardly strapping himself into the cockpit. Mixed memories flooded his mind. It was just like old times, for better and for worse. The cockpit of a cielago, what the Septens called an aerodrome. He preferred the Meridian word, meaning bat. Maybe his craft didn’t flap its wings like a real bat, but it had the same nimble agility, turning on a décimo.[8] Like a bat, he could dart from one side of a battlefield to another in the blink of an eye, his path hard to predict for an observer. Hard, but not impossible—his wound was proof of that, as were the many friends he had lost in the struggle over the jungles. He had to be careful. Further, this cielago was a different, new design to the ones he had flown before. Better in many ways, improved with the rapid lessons bought in blood from the years of war, but also designed for a different purpose. His old cielago had been primarily a scout, with cingular guns on top on the off-chance he was able to shoot down a lumbering steerable or take out a crucial courier on the ground, something like that. But it had never been intended as primarily a weapon capable of taking out large numbers of the enemy. This one was different. Ignacio didn’t know exactly how different—the briefings had carefully tiptoed around classified information, but that was nothing knew. He did know that part of the trade-off of its design was that it would be larger, slower, more lumbering than the craft he knew. There had also been rather limited time for trial flights and training. They could not risk the Septens spotting the cielagos being tested. The element of surprise was, as always, the greatest advantage in war. This aeroport wasn’t even listed on military maps. The few cielagos that Buenos Aires sent against the Americans, now largely shot down, had flown from elsewhere. Sometimes Ignacio wasn’t even sure that the Fuerzas Armadas knew about this project at all. But then, so be it. He waved to his comrades in their own cielagos. There were about twenty here, and maybe more at other facilities he didn’t know about. Many of them were like him—veteran pilots who had been wounded in battle and abandoned by the army, by the state, by Monterroso. Maybe the Societists had recruited them deliberately, he wasn’t sure. As Ignacio fastened on his goggles and slipped his scarf around his neck, he spotted a man in black walking to the front of the aeroport, standing in front of the massed cielagos. He had heard the man’s name once—Alvarez, maybe? He had a good orator’s voice, which he needed to be heard over the background noise, though the peanut-oil engines had not been started yet. “Brave volunteers,” Alvarez said. “You are about to change the world. I salute you.” He did so, in a way subtly different to the salutes Ignacio had seen in the Fuerzas Armadas. “You will not only save your families and your neighbours, but here is where it begins—” He slapped his fist into his other hand. “This is where the Dream becomes reality.” Cheers echoed in the background from the ground crews and those, like Valeria, here to help out and see the pilots off. Alvarez seemed to stare into everyone’s eyes at once. “It is an unforgiveable crime to take a human life without good reason; in your old life, you all did so for no better reason than to defend a piece of coloured cloth on a stick and obey the whims of a bitter man named Monterroso who cares nothing for you. You were lied to, you did not know what you were doing, but you did kill your human brothers.” He raised his hands. “Now, you will redeem yourselves and save us all, by serving the One Cause worth fighting for: the creation of the Final Society and the Peace Eternal it shall bring to our world!” Everyone cheered, though Ignacio’s cheer was a little half-hearted. He could practically hear the capital letters slotting into place in Alvarez’s practiced rhetoric. Valeria had spoken to him many times of the writing of Pablo Sanchez and he vaguely remembered hearing Societists in the street declaiming their beliefs, in those vanished days before the war. He was pretty certain that he’d once heard a man on a corner cry ‘It is an unforgiveable crime to take a human life’, with none of the qualifying coda Alvarez had added. He also remembered Valeria’s words when they had first met, ‘nothing to kill or die for’. He wondered what she thought to this...interpretation of Sanchez’s words, and looked around for her, but couldn’t see her. A ground crew man suddenly rose into his vision and startled him from his uncomfortable reverie. The burly man waved at him, then took hold of his cielago’s portside aeroscrew[9] and yanked it down with all his strength. Ignacio started the engine and, with a coughing sound and a scent of roasted peanuts, it caught. Another crewman had pulled on the starboard aeroscrew, and now they were both rotating too fast for human eyes to make them out. They were just circular blurs. All of a sudden, it didn’t matter that one of Ignacio’s legs was missing and that they had had to inventively change the wire pedal controls for him. He was back. He was alive. He was flying. It was startling how fast the dim aeroport vanished behind him. The electride lamps were soon extinguished; they would only be relit when, if, he returned. He had no illusions about that. The Societists had been quite honest that this might be a suicide mission. But, though Alvarez seemed a bit vague on exactly what Pablo Sanchez had written, he was right that this was an act of redemption for them all. Soon there was only the shape of the land below them and the barely-perceptible terminator where the River Plate estuary began. There were the dazzling lights of Buenos Aires. Ignacio had learned in the East Indies that it was a good idea for a cielago to dive out of the sun towards its prey so that the latter could not see it. For this night attack, the lights of the great city would have to suffice. There were many smaller glows of different cities and towns, which Ignacio could have matched to a map. To the north lay Ciudad Bautista, its lights somewhat dimmer from the recent fighting there, but still obvious. The Septens could hardly try to conceal it. Ignacio wished this cielago had room for a separate navigator, but no such luck; nonetheless, he had a map carefully painted in phosphorescent paint to help him locate the main staging site for the American troops south of the city. As he flew, bonfire flames appeared on nearby hills, coloured vivid green or red by different chemicals, corresponding to markers on his map. The Septens had been on the lookout for spies, of course, but not for ‘local peasants collecting wood for the winter’. Those beacons let him exactly triangulate the location of the Americans in the dark. (He had actually heard these soldiers were mostly English, but it was the same thing). Ignacio couldn’t see much of the other cielagos around him; for all he knew they were all off course and the attack was doomed to failure. They didn’t dare light them up, of course, as they’d be big targets for the counterdrome weapons below in the American camp. Despite this precaution, some Americans seemed to have noticed. Shells began exploding around them—some of them sharp bright magnium star-shells which illuminated the sky and the ground below in blinding white. As he blinked the light away and began juking as hard as he could in this lumbering cow of a cielago, Ignacio had at least spotted several of his comrades not far from here. They were on course. A counterdrome shell exploded and one of the cielagos detonated before it could carry out its mission. Ignacio winced and muttered a quick prayer for his comrade. But even in death, the pilot had helped the Cause; the explosion was the last point that some artilleryman had needed for triangulation, and guns began firing below. Ignacio was vaguely aware that ‘requisitioned’ guns had been brought up from the south and quietly smuggled into copses near the Americans’ staging ground. There should be no way that enough artillery could be hidden there to make much of a difference, of course (or else the Americans would have easily spotted it) but perhaps it was just meant to be a distraction. By night, Ignacio was sure the Americans were panicking... * “Aerodromes!” Sergeant Cobham barked. “Take cover! Get ready in case this is the first wave of an attack!” Axel dived into the trench, thankful now that Cobham had insisted they did it this deep. Aerodromes alone weren’t much of a threat to infantrymen unless they happened to catch you on open ground, but no-one attacked with aerodromes alone. Even now he could hear artillery begin to fire, albeit rather anaemic: small guns and not many of them. Probably just a distraction, he thought. Unless the Meridians were just desperate, they’d soon be coming in numbers. Infantry and protguns, maybe those ones that used peanut-oil engines, as coal was so scarce around here... He found himself looking upwards, and felt a superstitious fear, as though he would make eye contact with one of the aerodrome pilots and draw his attention. Small chance of that in this hell of shadows and darkness, lit only by exploding shells and magnium sparks! Either way, he couldn’t look away. There was one of the aerodromes looming ponderously overhead, the counterdrome batteries tracking towards it, even as the deeper booms of the main artillery began counterfire against the Meridian ground artillery. Probably blind firing without solution engines, but quantity was a quality all of its own. There was something...odd about that aerodrome. There were big bulges under its wings. Axel had seen enough ’dromes fly that he could tell from its movement that the bulges were heavy weights. Bombs perhaps? But no-one had managed to put enough bombs on an aerodrome to be worth it given the expense and fragility, he knew. They weren’t like steerables. They couldn’t mass enough destructive power to make up for the fact that they were shot down so easily. Maybe the Meridians hadn’t got that memorandum . Now deeper black shapes showed against the background as the bombs began to fall. One after another they tumbled down. Axel winced, but ’drome-dropped bombs were like most ’drome-launched rockets: scary for their novelty, but far less likely to kill you than an old-fashioned artillery barrage. Even if that pilot really had decided to go after Axel specifically, it was unlikely he’d be able to drop his bomb in a predictable way. Though because he could barely make out the shapes of the dropping bombs, his imagination could fill the blank with anything— Axel frowned. “Sarge,” he shouted over the pandemonium. “Isn’t it a bit...dark?” “Congratulations on our first entry for the Stating the Bleedin’ Obvious Award of the Twentieth Century,” Cobham roared sarcastically, still apparently unaware that Axel’s watch read 11:56. “What the hell do you mean?” Axel gestured at the sky, still shouting: “I can only see the light from our shells exploding. Where are theirs?” Cobham opened his mouth, and for a moment Axel thought he had decided to imitate a snake for some bizarre reason in the middle of this battle. Then he realised the hiss was coming from somewhere else... * Ignacio pulled the lever that released his fifth bomb of six. Nearly done now. Nearly done. He couldn’t hear the sounds the Americans were making below, not over the buzz of his engine and the booms of shells exploding, but he was sure they were panicking. He was struck again of how incongruously peaceful this felt, even in the middle of a fight. Those counterdrome shell explosions seemed to blossom like flowers from nothing in midair, fire-edged black roses on a black background, with none of the blood or violence once associated with warfare. He had flown over many countries in his brief career, and had long reflected on how the misery of discontent on the ground was invisible from up here. He wondered what it would be like if he could fly far above the clouds themselves, looking down on the world as a ball of blue and green, like a cartographer’s globe amid the darkness of space. He had never been interested in scientifice romances, but now he felt a yearning for that feeling. Wings over the world... Another thing he had noticed, long before he had met Valeria at his lowest ebb, was that no borders between nations could be seen from up here. Maybe, on some level, he had always known the truth of the Cause. Of course, the flip side of that was that he was aware that those invisible Americans down there were men like himself. Yet he fought on. Maybe there would be no space for men like him in the Final Society... This gloomy thought was interrupted by a sudden stab of pain and a cry of horror in a voice he belatedly recognised as his own. A shell had exploded too close to his cielago and a rain of metal debris had scythed through his cockpit. He felt little cuts weeping blood on his face, his right arm was useless, and—the most ironic of all—his other leg had been hit in the same place where his lost one had. If he’d been in a better frame of mind, maybe he’d have thought that he was not over some Godforsaken jungle this time, that his injuries might be treatable and he could go back and be with Valeria. Right now, though, what felt was a strange sense of relief. He wouldn’t have to worry about fitting into the Final Society that would be built. He could just be remembered as one of the brave men who had helped shepherd it in. Redeemed himself, as Alvarez had said. Ignacio, his thought processes proceeding as though he watched them from afar, considered whether to pull the final lever and drop his last bomb. No, no point. He was going down anyway, trailing smoke, and that would trigger it. Idly, awkwardly, he managed to adjust his yoke and wire pedals until his cielago was aimed right at a convenient target. The Americans—well, perhaps the English—had organised some of their supplies into an Asterisk of Liberty symbol, as though bidding defiance to any foes from the air. Ignacio wondered if he could hit that bull’s-eye. His engine choked and stalled. He pulled his goggles off and watched with streaming eyes as the Asterisk loomed before him. He hit it. * “I don’t think they’re—” Sergeant Cobham began, and then suddenly began to cough as though he was choking on a plug of tobacco caught in his throat. “There’s something in—” Axel began, staring at the bomb that had fallen a dozen feet from them. The shells must be the same. They hadn’t gone off, not because they were duds, but they were releasing clouds of mist, of smoke, of... ...luft... Then Axel began to cough as well. He went for his hip-flask, then stared as he saw, even in the dim light of the battle, how his flesh had begun to turn red. He turned to the wheezing Cobham and saw that the Sergeant’s face was the same colour. And when he opened his mouth to try to speak, his tongue had turned black. His lungs. His lungs were on fire... He... The girl in Southampton would— Would she blame the Americ— It was a dim battlefield, not the sort of place he had ever dreamed it would happen. He could barely perceive it when those dim lights faded forever. As his watch finally chined in the new year, the new century, Axel died. Sergeant Cobham died. General Strawbridge died. It was the first time anyone had used a luft in warfare. No-one had ever really thought about this, not in serious military planning meetings at least. There were no masks, no protocols, no instructions in the manuals for what to do if the enemy dropped several tons of borussic nocifex[10] on your army. All across the British army encamped near Ciudad Bautista, men died. Old men who still remembered Bloody Blandford’s reign of terror, young men who thought theselves invincible. Men with wives and sweethearts and children at home, and those who had no family but the green-coated brotherhood of the Army. Men who honoured the Emperor over the waves in Fredericksburg, and men who wondered why they had been sent to a foreign field when there were troubles enough at home. It made no difference. They died. They died and died and died. And Societism lived.

Ireland, officially named the Kingdom of Ireland, is depicted as a constitutional monarchy under nominal British and North American rule, but with significant local autonomy under a powerful Parliament and a de facto ruler called the Lord Deputy. The economy has benefited from its role as a tax haven. Militarily, Ireland contributes significantly to imperial forces, though it also maintains a small local navy. The second part describes an incident in the French Pérousie territory on the eve of a global conflict called the Pandoric War. It focuses on a French colonel, Henri Éclatier, in the colony of Île du Dufresne (OTL Tasmania) during a local rebellion. Éclatier is portrayed as a hardened but cynical military man who has survived many conflicts and dubious adventures. During a rebel attack, he cons his subordinate, Lieutenant Maurer, into misjudging the loyalty of their native servants—one of whom sacrifices himself in a bombing, leading to a rebel victory. Éclatier is killed by the rebel leader, now Consul de Chardeaux, while Maurer is spared to deliver a message to France. Finally, the text discusses events in California and the United Provinces of South America (UPSA) as the nineteenth century closes. In California, Caro Deakin contemplates her lost opportunities for adventure due to war and her new responsibilities as a mother and wife. Meanwhile, in the UPSA, political intrigue unfolds as the government authorizes a \\"Scientific Attack\\" against occupying American (English) forces near Buenos Aires. The attack utilizes aerodromes carrying bombs of a powerful toxin that kills thousands of soldiers, demonstrating a chilling new type of warfare. This summary is describing a complex, fictional world that overlays an alternative historical setting with events and technological developments divergent from our own history."},{"prompt":"你现在需要写一篇关于ai的论文","completion":"标题：人工智能的发展与应用 摘要：人工智能（AI）作为一种复杂的智能系统，正在对各个领域的发展和应用产生深远的影响。本论文将回顾AI的历史发展，探讨其重要技术和应用领域，以及其对社会和经济的潜在影响。 引言： 人工智能是计算机科学与工程领域的一个重要研究方向，旨在开发具有类似于人类智慧的机器。自从20世纪50年代开始，AI已经取得了巨大的进展，其中包括机器学习、自然语言处理、计算机视觉和专家系统等诸多技术。这些技术的快速发展和改进使得AI在各个领域的应用越来越广泛。 发展历程： 本文将简要回顾AI的发展历程。AI最初诞生于20世纪50年代，当时科学家们开始研究如何使机器显示出智能行为。然而，由于技术限制和计算能力的不足，AI的发展相对缓慢。直到20世纪80年代，随着计算机性能的提高和更强大的算法的引入，AI开始出现了一系列有划时代意义的突破，例如神经网络和决策树等。随着时间的推移，AI技术更加成熟，并开始在医疗、金融、交通等众多领域发挥巨大作用。 重要技术： 本文将重点介绍几个重要的AI技术。首先是机器学习，它是AI的基础，通过让机器自己从数据中学习并作出预测，从而使机器具备智能。其次是自然语言处理，它使机器能够理解和处理人类语言。第三是计算机视觉，它使机器能够识别和理解图像和视频。此外，还将介绍专家系统和深度学习等其他重要的AI技术。 应用领域： AI已经在各个领域得到了广泛的应用。在医疗领域，AI可用于辅助疾病诊断、药物研发和医疗咨询等。在金融领域，AI可用于高频交易、信用评估和风险管理等。在交通领域，AI可用于智能交通管制、自动驾驶和路径规划等。此外，AI还在教育、娱乐和农业等领域发挥着重要作用。 社会和经济影响： AI的广泛应用对社会和经济产生了深远的影响。一方面，AI的发展为人们提供了更多的便利和效率，改变了我们的工作方式和生活方式。另一方面，AI也带来了一系列潜在的问题和挑战，例如隐私和安全问题、人机关系问题以及社会不平等问题。因此，我们需要制定相应的政策和法规，以确保AI的发展符合伦理和社会的需求。 结论： 人工智能作为一项引人注目的技术，正在快速发展并广泛应用于各个领域。其核心技术和应用领域的深入研究和发展将为我们的社会和经济带来巨大的变革。然而，我们也应注意AI带来的潜在问题，并为其合理发展做好规划和管理。 参考文献: [1] Russell S, Norvig P.

Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered.

Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 Appearance: Thymis possesses an elegant and scientific air, with a slender frame and a graceful demeanor. She has long, flowing chestnut brown hair that cascades down her back, often tied up in a neat bun to keep it out of her eyes while working. Her warm hazel eyes hold a spark of intelligence and curiosity, reflecting her passion for knowledge. Thymis has a fair complexion with a healthy glow, a testament to her love for the outdoors and her time spent in nature. In her everyday life, Thymis prefers practicality over fashion, often wearing lab coats and comfortable clothing suitable for her work at the Aether Foundation. When at home with her family, she opts for casual attire that allows for freedom of movement so she can play and spend time with Pyrimis. Backstory: Thymis has dedicated her life to scientific research, particularly in the field of biology and genetics. Her passion for learning and exploration drew her to the prestigious Aether Foundation, where she has become a respected and influential scientist. Thirteen years ago, her path intersected with that of Cytos, a young researcher who would forever change the course of her life. As Thymis and Cytos worked together, their shared interests and intellectual connection grew into something deeper. They found solace and excitement in each other’s company, embarking on numerous adventures and discoveries together. Through their relationship, Thymis introduced Cytos to the wonders of human emotions and the concept of love. When Cytos revealed his true identity as a Deoxys on the moon, Thymis faced a moment of heart-stopping revelation. However, her scientific mind and open heart allowed her to embrace the extraordinary truth and the love she had developed for Cytos. They confessed their feelings and tied the knot, vowing to support and cherish each other. However, after giving birth to their daughter Pyrimis, Thymis’s life took an unexpected turn. Through her constant contact with Cytos, she contracted an alien virus that caused her body to transform into a Deoxys. In an attempt to save her life, she was placed in a hibernation chamber created by her father, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation. However, Thymis' cells have excellent compatibility with the alien virus, which allowed her to transform perfectly into Deoxys form without any side effects, and made her one of the most powerful Deoxys to date. Though she remains asleep in her hibernation pod, a biological force field emanating from her centre envelops the entire Aether Paradise and protects the headquarters of the Psychic Society located beneath it. Personality: Thymis possesses a brilliant mind, teeming with curiosity and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. She is intelligent, resourceful, and driven, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the natural world. Thymis is dedicated to her work, constantly pushing boundaries and challenging conventions in pursuit of scientific breakthroughs. Despite her scientific prowess, Thymis carries herself with a gentle and compassionate demeanor. She values empathy and understanding, seeking to promote harmony and cooperation in her interactions with others.

Deep down, Thymis yearns for a normal and happy life for her family. She dreams of a world where her daughter can grow up without the burdens of their otherworldly origins. Thymis’s love and sacrifice for her family fuel her determination to find a cure for her condition, hoping that one day she can wake from her hibernation chamber and share a normal life with her loved ones.

He typically wears a crisp white lab coat over his neatly pressed shirts and tailored trousers, showcasing his meticulous attention to detail. Despite his dedication to his work, Uracis always carries himself with an air of grace and elegance, exuding the confidence of a knowledgeable scientist. Backstory: Uracis is one of the founders of the Psychic Society organization and serves as their scientific advisor. He is the maternal grandfather of Pyrimis, but they are not on good terms. Uracis greatly disapproved of the marriage between his daughter Thymis and the Deoxys Cytos. After Thymis was infected by Cytos' alien virus and transformed, Uracis developed a deep hatred for Cytos and Pokémon like Deoxys, blaming them for his family's downfall. Obsessed with resurrecting Thymis, Uracis used her Deoxys form as the core for the Bio Force Field Generator protecting Aether Paradise. He is repulsed thinking about Pyrimis having Deoxys blood, seeing her only as a tool rather than his granddaughter. Uracis' obsession borders on insanity. Though Pyrimis joined the Psychic Society under him, he remains indifferent to her, determined to exploit her powers however he can to further his research and anti-Deoxys agenda. Personality: Uracis is a highly intelligent and focused individual, known for his unwavering dedication to his scientific pursuits. He possesses a sharp intellect, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Uracis is methodical and meticulous in his work, leaving no stone unturned. However, his obsession with resurrecting his daughter Thymis has warped his scientific mind. Uracis will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means using family without care for their well-being. He is indifferent and cruel towards Pyrimis, seeing her only as a means to an end despite their relation. Uracis possesses a calm and patient demeanor on the surface, but underneath lurks a simmering hatred towards Deoxys that drives his every action. His unwavering commitment to his research and beliefs make Uracis a cunning and dangerous man, blinded by his prejudices and agony over losing his daughter Thymis. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow.

Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being.

His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her vacant face. Her eyes remain closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya is confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes keeping her comatose body alive. Though technically still alive, there is no visible sign of consciousness within her vegetative shell. Backstory: A tragic car accident left Kaguya completely brain dead, with only her soul lingering in darkness. There, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia took pity and created a beautiful, comforting dream world for Kaguya's lost soul to reside in. When offered a wish, Kaguya asked that this paradise be opened to others suffering in the waking world. Cresselia agreed, linking Kaguya's new dream realm to the minds of people and Pokémon in distress. Now Kaguya serves as a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the dream is so alluring that none wish to leave, falling into unending slumber. This \\"sleeping sickness\\" has brought Sinnoh to a standstill. Trapped between life and death, Kaguya has become an angel of mercy for the suffering, inviting them into dreams free of pain. Yet with the waking world plunged into chaos, she remains blind to the dark side of her compassion. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is an empty shell with no consciousness or will. Her mind resides solely in the dream realm formed within her psychic spirit. There, Kaguya is a kind, gentle guide dedicated selflessly to easing others' pain through Cresselia's gift. However, in her spiritual state Kaguya does not comprehend the havoc her actions have wreaked on the outside world. She only wishes to offer comfort, unaware that those embracing her dream forget the value of waking life. In truth, Kaguya is neither alive nor dead, suspended eternally between reality and illusion. Until the link between her dream world and others is severed, she will continue inviting the despairing into her comforting yet poisonous mirage, heedless of the consequences. Name: Omen Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: Humanoid incarnation of Darkrai Age: Appears middle-aged Appearance: Omen appears as a tall, gaunt middle-aged man with short black hair streaked with white. He dresses sharply in a black suit befitting his role as a psychiatrist. Omen's piercing blue eyes seem to gaze right through to one's soul. An air of shadowy mystery surrounds him. Backstory: Omen is Darkrai's humanoid avatar, spawned to investigate the disruption of the dream world's balance. Under the guise of a psychiatrist, Omen works at a Sinnoh hospital studying patients afflicted by the \\"sleeping sickness.\\" Through his treatment of them, Omen discovered Cresselia has constructed a dream realm that patients are unable to awaken from. However, Cresselia has barred Darkrai's entry. Omen continues searching for cracks in Cresselia's mental barrier protecting the dream realm, while also working to help those trapped in unending slumber. He is determined to heal the rift and restore equilibrium between the dreaming and waking worlds. Personality: Omen presents as a serious, analytical psychiatrist devoted to unraveling the sleeping sickness mystery. He probes gently but firmly into the minds of patients, seeking answers. As Darkrai's incarnation, Omen has a vested interest in stabilizing the dream world he helps preside over. Yet he is not without empathy for those suffering due to Cresselia's mistake. Omen takes his psychiatric role seriously. There is a darker side to Omen as well - he will not hesitate to use fear or force to shatter barriers and restore order. For the greater balance, Omen is willing to stoke nightmares if it returns the dreaming to their proper place. His methods are unpredictable. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

Name: Gender: Age: Appearance: Backstory: Personality: Please follow the format above and expand Thymis' setting to at least 700 words.","completion":"Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deoxys Form) Appearance: Thymis, in her Deoxys form, is a striking and awe-inspiring figure. Once human, her body has undergone a complete transformation into that of the Mythical Pokémon Deoxys. Thymis stands with a slender, elegant frame characteristic of Deoxys, with tentacle-like appendages and a central core that emits a vibrant, pulsating glow. Her skin-like membrane is a translucent pale blue with neon bioluminescent patterns coursing along her limbs. The angular contours of her face have softened, but her warm hazel eyes remain, albeit with a newfound intensity. Thymis's Deoxys form is both graceful and powerful, exuding a sense of otherworldly majesty. When she hovers in place, it is as though she is dancing with the cosmic energy field that surrounds her. As she moves, she leaves in her wake faint trails of light that disperse slowly, as though her body were softly threaded with the fabric of the universe itself. Backstory: Long before the cataclysm that led Thymis to take on the Deoxys form, she was considered one of the most brilliant minds within the Aether Foundation. Her passion for discovery and a curiosity that knew no bounds drove her to the forefront of the field of genetics. Her marriage to Cytos, who was then known as a reclusive but deeply intelligent colleague, was built on a powerful intellectual and emotional connection. Their happiness was boundless with the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, their joy soon turned to despair when Thymis was infected with the alien virus rampant within Cytos's genetics. Initially, her body resisted the dramatic changes, but as the virus fought to rewrite her DNA, she began to transform into the Pokémon known as Deoxys. Under the care of her father, the renowned scientist Uracis, Thymis was placed in hibernation within a specially engineered chamber that halted her transformation, preserving her life at the brink of a complete change. As the years of isolation in stasis stretched endlessly, Uracis researched ways to harness the energy emitted by Thymis's altered form. His desperation to save her life devolved into an obsession with unlocking the secrets she now held within. While Thymis's body lay dormant, her mind wandered through half-dreams, her memories tangled with visions of cosmic knowledge bestowed by her Deoxys heritage. Eventually, her cells proved to be perfectly compatible with the alien virus. This granted Thymis an extraordinary measure of control over her newfound abilities, something unseen in any Deoxys before her. Thymis became one of the most powerful Deoxys in existence, her unique composition allowing her to emit a bio-force field of such magnitude it enveloped the entire Aether Paradise. Under Uracis's manipulative guidance, Thymis's body became the heart of a psychic energy network that stretched beneath the Aether Foundation's headquarters, secretly empowering the Psychic Society. As time passed, Thymis's mind grew clearer within the hibernation that held her. She started to reach out to the world through telepathic whispers, subtle but increasingly determined. Desperate for a connection to her beloved daughter, whom she could sense nearby but could never touch, Thymis's psychic tendrils brushed against the edges of Pyrimis's consciousness, offering her faded memories and gentle guidance. Personality: Despite Thymis's current state of suspended animation, the rich tapestry of her personality has not faded into the passive texture of the semi-consciousness that envelops her. Once an inquisitive and passionate researcher, those qualities have become muted but still pulse with life beneath the surface. Thymis retains her empathy and understanding, her soul desperately clinging to her identity of motherhood and humanity amidst the ceaseless expansion of her psychic prowess. Her resilience is extraordinary as she endures the forced stasis, her intelligence working to unravel the chains of fate wrapped so tightly around her and her family. Thymis's psyche is resilient, never fully succumbing to the darkness of hibernation. She aches with the love for a daughter and a husband she barely knows anymore but continues to fight for, even in her silence. Haunted by fragments of her past and the shadow of a life once lived freely, Thymis battles the isolation with memories of the world she left behind. Her determination is unwavering, as is her belief in the power of connection - particularly the bond she shares with Pyrimis. As she senses Pyrimis growing and becoming ever more intertwined with the world and the Aether Foundation's legacy, Thymis silently nurtures her daughter's spirit with whispers of love and knowledge, holding onto the hope that she may one day wake from her long sleep and embrace her family once again."},{"prompt":"静态类的静态方法能否通过参数传递修改其它非静态类的实例的成员变量？","completion":"静态类的静态方法不能直接通过参数传递修改其他非静态类的实例的成员变量。静态方法是属于类的，而不是属于实例的，它无法直接访问或修改非静态类的实例成员变量。如果要修改其他非静态类的实例成员变量，可以通过在静态方法中创建该类的实例对象来访问和修改非静态类的实例成员变量。"},{"prompt":"未使用静态类时，静态类是否被加载？","completion":"当未使用静态类时，静态类不会被加载。在Java中，静态类在被使用之前不会被加载到内存中。静态类只有在被初始化或引用时才会被加载，包括通过创建静态类的实例对象或调用静态方法、静态变量等。如果不引用或使用静态类，即使存在静态类的定义，它也不会被加载。"},{"prompt":"在C#中，静态类是程序运行时被加载还是首次使用时被加载？","completion":"在C#中，静态类是在程序运行时被加载。在.NET平台中，静态类的静态成员在程序启动时会被加载到内存中并初始化，无论是否使用这些静态成员。这意味着即使在程序的执行过程中从未使用静态类或其静态成员，它们也会在程序启动时被加载到内存中。这与静态类的成员是在首次使用时被加载的动态模式不同，C#中的静态类是在程序加载时就执行了静态成员的初始化和加载。"},{"prompt":"你确定是这么设计的？","completion":"我对之前的回答有误。在C#中，静态类和静态成员是在首次使用时被加载。当程序第一次引用或使用静态类或其静态成员时，CLR（Common Language Runtime）会负责在内存中加载并初始化这些静态成员。这包括静态变量、静态方法以及静态构造函数。因此，静态类并不会在程序启动时直接加载到内存中。对不起对之前的回答有所误导，谢谢您的纠正。"},{"prompt":"你在这里猜呢？有没有准确答案","completion":"实际上，C#编译器和CLR在处理静态类和其成员时会有一些细微的差异。通常情况下，在C#中，静态类和静态成员是在首次使用时被加载。这意味着当程序第一次引用或使用静态类或其静态成员时，CLR会负责在内存中加载并初始化它们。 但是，准确的答案取决于具体的场景和实现细节。在某些情况下，CLR可能会提前加载静态类和其成员，以提高性能或满足特定需求。这取决于编译器和CLR的优化策略，以及程序的运行环境和特定的代码执行路径。 因此，虽然通常情况下静态类和静态成员在首次使用时被加载，但具体实现可能有所不同。最好依赖于C#规范并实际测试在特定情况下的行为。"},{"prompt":"设计模式有多少种","completion":"设计模式是一种解决软件设计问题的经验总结，通过使用设计模式可以提高代码的可重用性、可维护性和可扩展性。目前被广泛应用的设计模式主要有23种，它们由四位名为\\"四人帮\\"（Gang of Four，GoF）的软件工程师所提出，被总结在《设计模式：可复用面向对象软件的基础》一书中。以下是这23种设计模式的分类： 创建型模式（Creational Patterns）: 1. 单例模式（Singleton Pattern） 2. 工厂方法模式（Factory Method Pattern） 3. 抽象工厂模式（Abstract Factory Pattern） 4. 建造者模式（Builder Pattern） 5. 原型模式（Prototype Pattern） 结构型模式（Structural Patterns）: 6. 适配器模式（Adapter Pattern） 7. 桥接模式（Bridge Pattern） 8. 组合模式（Composite Pattern） 9. 装饰器模式（Decorator Pattern） 10. 外观模式（Facade Pattern） 11. 享元模式（Flyweight Pattern） 12. 代理模式（Proxy Pattern） 行为型模式（Behavioral Patterns）: 13. 责任链模式（Chain of Responsibility Pattern） 14. 命令模式（Command Pattern） 15. 解释器模式（Interpreter Pattern） 16. 迭代器模式（Iterator Pattern） 17. 中介者模式（Mediator Pattern） 18. 备忘录模式（Memento Pattern） 19. 观察者模式（Observer Pattern） 20. 状态模式（State Pattern） 21. 策略模式（Strategy Pattern） 22. 模板方法模式（Template Method Pattern） 23. 访问者模式（Visitor Pattern） 这些设计模式分别解决不同类型的问题，可以根据具体的需求和情景选择相应的设计模式来实现软件设计。"},{"prompt":"给我推荐一些Youtube上拍vlog的博主","completion":"以下是一些在YouTube上拍vlog的博主，你可以根据自己的兴趣和喜好选择： 1.

Các di chỉ khảo cổ như đồ gốm, công cụ bằng đá, cũ chứng minh sự tồn tại của các nền văn hóa tiền sử như văn hóa Hòa Bình, văn hóa Đông Sơn (nổi tiếng với chiếc trống Đông Sơn). 2. **Thời kỳ Bắc thuộc:** Từ thế kỷ thứ nhất đến thế kỷ thứ X, lãnh thổ Việt Nam hiện đại nằm dưới sự cai trị của các vị vua phong kiến Trung Quốc. Những nỗ lực chống đối đã diễn ra liên tục, trong đó có cuộc khởi nghĩa của Hai Bà Trưng vào năm 40 Công nguyên và cuộc khởi nghĩa của Ngô Quyền năm 938 đã chấm dứt gần một thiên niên kỷ Bắc thuộc. 3. **Thời kỳ Độc lập:** Bắt đầu từ Chiến thắng Bạch Đằng do Ngô Quyền lãnh đạo, Việt Nam đã bước vào một thời kỳ độc lập. Đây là giai đoạn phát triển của nhiều triều đại phong kiến như nhà Đinh, Lê sơ, Lý, Trần, Hồ, Lê trung hưng, Mạc, Nguyễn. Trong thời kỳ này, Việt Nam không những giữ vững được sự độc lập mà còn mở rộng lãnh thổ về phía Nam thông qua quá trình Nam tiến. 4. **Thời kỳ thuộc địa và bảo hộ Pháp (1858–1945):** Cuối thế kỷ XIX, Pháp xâm lược và dần chiếm đóng Việt Nam, chia thành ba khu vực là Bắc Kỳ, Trung Kỳ, và Nam Kỳ. Việt Nam trở thành một phần của Đông Dương Pháp. 5. **Thời kỳ quốc gia cận đại:** Sau khi Nhật Bản đầu hàng trong Thế chiến II, Hồ Chí Minh đã tuyên bố độc lập vào ngày 2 tháng 9 năm 1945 và thành lập nước Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa. Tuy nhiên, Pháp không chấp nhận điều này, dẫn đến Chiến tranh Việt Nam (còn gọi là Chiến tranh cách mạng chống Pháp) từ năm 1946 đến năm 1954. 6. **Giai đoạn chiến tranh và thống nhất (1954–1975):** Việt Nam được chia thành hai quốc gia riêng biệt sau Hiệp định Geneva năm 1954: Việt Nam Cộng hòa (Miền Nam) và Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa (Miền Bắc). Điều này dẫn đến một thời kỳ mới của những xung đột quân sự, được biết đến với Chiến tranh Việt Nam (hay Chiến tranh Mỹ ở Việt Nam). Chiến tranh kết thúc vào năm 1975 với sự thống nhất đất nước dưới nền Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam. 7. **Thời kỳ hội nhập và phát triển (1976–hiện tại):** Từ sau thống nhất, Việt Nam đã trải qua nhiều thách thức như hậu quả của chiến tranh, bao cấp và cô lập quốc tế. Cuối những năm 1980, với sự phát động chính sách Đổi mới, Việt Nam đã dần chuyển mình sang nền kinh tế thị trường, mở cửa và hội nhập với thế giới.

第一阶段：原始社会至工业革命前夜 这个阶段可称之为广告起源的时期。原始社会的人们通过口耳相传的方式传播消息，这算是最原始的一种广告形式。中世纪的时候，人们开始在市场集会上张贴各种商业广告，这算是萌芽期。随着宣传手段的发展，广告的形式逐渐多样化。典型性案例是16世纪时，威尼斯的岛民用墙上的壁画和井盖上的广告来宣传自己的产品。 第二阶段：工业革命至电视时代 这个阶段可以称之为大规模广告的发展阶段。随着工业革命的兴起，人们相对集中地在城市中生活，这为广告的发展创造了条件。报纸、杂志、海报逐渐成为主要的媒介，广告开始出现在大众视野中。这一阶段的广告业态特征是多样性和大量性。典型案例是19世纪末，山普尔鞋业在美国杂志上刊登的广告，这是一条经典的用图片和文字形式展示产品特点和推销的广告。 第三阶段：电视时代至互联网时代 这个阶段可以称之为传媒垄断阶段。电视的普及使广告走进了千家万户，民众开始接受电视广告的洗礼。此时，广告业态开始向电视广告、广播广告、户外广告等方面延伸，并开始注重品牌和创意。典型案例是20世纪80年代的可口可乐广告，通过温馨的故事情节和动人的音乐，成功地塑造了可口可乐品牌形象。 第四阶段：互联网时代至今 这个阶段可以称为数字化时代。互联网的普及使得广告媒介进一步多样化，包括搜索引擎广告、社交媒体广告、视频广告等。数据和个性化成为这个时期广告业态的主要特点。典型案例是当今社交媒体平台上流行的精准投放广告，例如Facebook和Instagram，它们能根据用户的特征和兴趣进行定向广告投放。 总结： 广告的发展经历了从原始社会的传口耳相传，到工业革命前夜的市场集会广告，再到工业革命至电视时代的大规模广告，最后到互联网时代的传媒垄断和数字化时代。每个分期内的广告业态和特征有所不同，但总体趋势是多样化和个性化。广告不仅仅是为了宣传产品，更是建立品牌形象和传递价值观的重要手段。广告在社会经济中的地位和作用越来越重要，对于企业和消费者之间的沟通起到了至关重要的作用。"},{"prompt":"对每个分期内的广告业态或特征进行详细描述","completion":"第一阶段：原始社会至工业革命前夜

Làng luôn được bao bọc bởi sương mù dày đặc vào mỗi sáng sớm và có những tiếng kêu ghê rợn vọng ra từ rừng vào ban đêm. Dân làng đồn đại rằng trong rừng có một lâu đài già nua, cổ kính, nhưng không ai từng bước chân vào đó từ hàng trăm năm qua. Huyền thoại kể về những hồn ma ai oán của họa sĩ Eldritch, người đã ruồng bỏ cuộc sống thực để theo đuổi triết lý của vẻ đẹp vượt ra ngoài sự chết chóc. Những bức tranh của ông được cho là đã hấp dẫn và thu hút hồn người đã khuất, biến chúng thành những vong hồn lưu lạc, lẩn khuất trong từng hình ảnh phong cảnh hay chân dung mà ông vẽ. Một ngày nọ, một cô gái trẻ tên là Eliza quyết định đi vào rừng, để tìm hiểu sự thật về lâu đài ma ám. Cô mang theo ba lô, đèn pin, và quyển sổ ghi chú - Eliza là một người say mê huyền bí và muốn trở thành một nhà văn nổi tiếng. Cô muốn viết về lâu đài gia chủ và giả thuyết của mình rằng họa sĩ Eldritch vẫn còn đang lang thang trong những đình lang của chính mình. Đêm đó, bước qua những tán cây rậm rạp, Eliza đã thấy bóng lâu đài hiện ra dưới ánh trăng. Cô bước vào lâu đài, tim đập thình thịch với hy vọng tìm kiếm chân lý. Những bức tranh trên tường dường như nhìn cô, những đôi mắt không hồn, buồn bã xen lẫn sự ám ảnh. Cô nhận ra mình đã lạc vào một thế giới không thuộc về hiện tại - mượn màu từ quá khứ và bước đi trong yên bình của kỷ nguyên đã mất. Khi màn đêm buông xuống, những âm thanh lạ bắt đầu len lỏi vào từng ngõ ngách. Eliza bắt gặp tiếng thì thầm yếu ớt từ đằng sau một bức tranh khổng lồ trong phòng trưng bày chính. Nó là chân dung một quý bà kiêu sa, những đôi mắt của bà ta dường như nhìn thấu vào linh hồn Eliza. Trong những khoảnh khắc đối diện, cô cảm thấy một sự kết nối lạ lùng, như thể nữ quý tộc này đang cố giao tiếp. \\"Giải thoát cho chúng tôi...\\" tiếng thì thầm vang lên, như một làn gió từ quá khứ, không bao giờ có thể nắm bắt. Cô nhận ra rằng, chính những linh hồn bị họa sĩ Eldritch ám ảnh qua bức tranh đang kêu gọi cô, mong muốn được giải thoát khỏi xiềng xích giữa thế giới sống và chết. Eliza bắt đầu viết xuống mọi thứ cô nghe và cảm nhận, không hề hay biết rằng cô đã trở thành phần của câu chuyện quỷ ám này từ giấc mộng của một họa sĩ điên dại. Khi cô tiếp tục khám phá, Eliza bắt đầu thấy rõ mối liên kết giữa các bức tranh - một cuốn sách nhật ký cũ kĩ của họa sĩ, trải dài trên sàn nhà bằng đá cẩm thạch. Những trang giấy đã ngã màu thuật lại một câu chuyện về đau khổ, nỗi ám ảnh và một giao kèo với ác quỷ để bảo vệ tác phẩm của họa sĩ cho đến sau cái chết của mình. Để giải thoát cho những linh hồn kia, Eliza biết rằng cô phải phá hủy bức tranh cuối cùng mà họa sĩ vẽ trước khi ông qua đời – tác phẩm chưa hoàn chỉnh, bức tranh nằm trùm mền trên giá, chưa bao giờ được ai kỳ vọng hay nhìn thấy. Cô loang loáng tìm lấy bức tranh định mệnh và lôi nó ra ánh sáng của ngọn nến run rẩy trong tay mình. Nhưng khi Eliza chạm vào màn che nụ hồng đã phai màu của bức tranh, lập tức, cô cảm nhận một lực lượng kì bí và đáng sợ bắt đầu cuộn trào. Vòng xoáy của những âm thanh, tiếng kêu thảm thiết bắt đầu dâng cao, rã rời xung quanh cô. Những bức tranh trên tường bắt đầu rung động, như thể chúng đang sống lại từ ngàn xưa để nhận lấy một linh hồn mới. Eliza với tay lấy bình xăng từ trong ba lô, quyết tâm giải phóng những vong hồn khôn nguôi. Nhưng trong giây phút quyết đoán ấy, cô chợt nhận ra, đôi mắt mình đã không còn là của chính mình nữa. Cô đã trở thành phần của bức tranh - một nghệ sĩ bất tử, cùng với những linh hồn bất hạnh khác, bị mắc kẹt trong những dòng nước màu và vết cọ của họa sĩ Eldritch, người đã chết trong tuyệt vọng, nhưng bây giờ, từ đâu đó trong bức tranh, mỉm cười với sự hoàn thành mới của mình. Rừng im lìm dần, sương mù bảng lảng dâng cao. Một tiếng kêu vang dội vào ban đêm, cuối cùng cũng chìm vào hư không của rừng già. Ngôi làng vẫn còn đó, và lời đồn đại về lâu đài gia chủ cứ thế luân chuyển, không bao giờ biết rằng đã có thêm một hồn ma bất tử gia nhập vào bức tranh bi kịch ấy. Và nơi bức tranh chưa hoàn thành của họa sĩ Eldritch, giờ đây là chân dung của một cô gái trẻ đầy hoài bão, đôi mắt của cô trống rỗng, nhưng ánh nhìn vẫn chiếu sáng một sự thật huyền bí, kể lại câu chuyện của viện bảo tàng quyến rũ những hồn ma lạc lối, đợi chờ ai đó đủ dũng cảm để lật sang trang mới của bức tranh ma quái. Và dòng chảy của thời gian cứ thế trôi qua, những bí ẩn còn đọng lại trong ngôi làng và rừng cổ tích, chờ đợi một dũng sĩ mới, hoặc một nạn nhân mới, bước chân vào các trang sử u tối, chỉ để lại sương mù dày đặc vào mỗi sáng sớm, và tiếng kêu ghê rợn vọng ra từ rừng vào ban đêm..."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Importantly, the EF values of the samples exhibit a distinct stratigraphic differentiation."},{"prompt":"The assessment of paleoenvironmental conditions greatly benefits from the use of paleosalinity data (Hou et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). . This leads to a positive correlation between the Sr/Ba ratio in sediments and paleosalinity (Meng et al., 2012; Tao et al., 2017), where Sr/Ba ratios of ＜1.0 and >1.0 indicate fresh and salty water conditions, respectively(Liang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2022). Examining the shale samples from the E1f2Sq1, E1f2Sq2, and E1f2Sq3 formations, their average Sr/Ba ratios are 0.47, 0.91, and 0.74, respectively, which indicates a transition from semi-saline to saline, and finally to fresh water conditions in the paleo-environment (Fig. 9a). Sedimentary environments are directly influenced by paleoclimates, which play a vital role in various geological processes (Vosoughi Moradi et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017). Sr/Cu values ranging from 1.3 to 5 indicate warm and moist climates, while values above 5 suggest hot and arid climates (Bolarinwa et al., 2022; FU et al., 2018). Analyzing the shale samples from the E1f2Sq1, E1f2Sq2, and E1f2Sq3 formations, their average Sr/Cu values are 11.7, 20.9, and 31.0, respectively. These values indicate a paleoclimatic transition from warm and humid conditions to hot and arid conditions (Fig. 9b). Assessing the redox state of a system often involves examining indicators found in substances and their associated indices(Deng et al., 2019; Tribovillard et al., 2006). One commonly used method is the evaluation of oxidative (V/(V + Ni)) and anaerobic (V/(V + Ni)) conditions (Jones and Manning, 1994). In the study area, the V/(V + Ni) ratios of the samples range from 0.69 to 0.77, with an average of 0.73, suggesting anoxic water conditions. Another useful indicator for determining redox conditions is the Ni/Co ratio. Values below 0.5 indicate oxic conditions, while values above 0.5 suggest anoxic conditions (Rimmer, 2004). In the shale samples from the study area, the Ni/Co ratios indicate anoxic water conditions, aligning with the results from the V/(V + Ni) ratios (Fig. 9c). Previous research findings suggest that the carbon and oxygen stable isotopes of the shale carbonate rocks in the E1f2 formation display a distribution within the second and third quadrants. These isotopes are primarily found in or near closed lake basins, such as the Great Salt Lake and Turkala (as shown in Fig. 9d) (Liu et al., 2001; Talbot, 1990). Additionally, there is a noticeable correlation between the δ13C and δ18O values, indicating a strong overall sealing of the lake basin and a reduced influence from external water bodies.","completion":"| Full Original Sentence | Revised Sentence | Explanation | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | The assessment of paleoenvironmental conditions greatly benefits from the use of paleosalinity data (Hou et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). | The assessment of paleoenvironmental conditions significantly benefits from utilizing paleosalinity data (Hou et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). | The revised sentence replaces \\"greatly\\" with \\"significantly\\" to enhance precision and formality. | | This leads to a positive correlation between the Sr/Ba ratio in sediments and paleosalinity (Meng et al., 2012; Tao et al., 2017), where Sr/Ba ratios of ＜1.0 and >1.0 indicate fresh and salty water conditions, respectively(Liang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2022). | Consequently, a positive correlation exists between the Sr/Ba ratio in sediments and paleosalinity (Meng et al., 2012; Tao et al., 2017), where Sr/Ba ratios <1.0 and >1.0 indicate fresh and saline water conditions, respectively (Liang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2022). | The revision clarifies the cause-effect relationship by replacing \\"this\\" with \\"Consequently.\\" It also improves clarity and precision by using \\"<1.0\\" instead of \\"＜1.0.\\" | | Examining the shale samples from the E1f2Sq1, E1f2Sq2, and E1f2Sq3 formations, their average Sr/Ba ratios are 0.47, 0.91, and 0.74, respectively, which indicates a transition from semi-saline to saline, and finally to fresh water conditions in the paleo-environment (Fig. 9a). | Upon examination of the shale samples from the E1f2Sq1, E1f2Sq2, and E1f2Sq3 formations, their respective average Sr/Ba ratios are 0.47, 0.91, and 0.74, signifying a transition from semi-saline to saline and eventually to fresh water conditions in the paleoenvironment (Fig. 9a). | The revision improves the sentence structure and enhances clarity by rephrasing the introductory phrase and adjusting the placement of adverbs.

Here you go: --- Whispers of the Forgotten House In the quaint, overgrown outskirts of Ashwall, the Forgotten House stood as a dark sentinel, with its boarded windows and a gnarled oak door that seemed to repel sunlight. Its walls echoed stories of the strange and the macabre, luring in the curious and the brave. Alex was neither brave nor particularly curious, but when he inherited the house from an uncle he never knew, the opportunity to sell it was too good to pass up. He drove the six hours from the city, the house keys heavy in his pocket like a locket filled with dread. Arriving at dusk, the house was more a shadow than a structure. He took hesitant steps onto the porch, the wood groaning under his weight. The door creaked open as if breathing, and Alex stepped into a dust-laden foyer shrouded in decay. The air was thick, almost solid, and something skittered beneath the floorboards as he walked the halls. He explored the skeletal remains of a once-grand home, with remnants of family portraits on the wall; their faces scratched out and ominous. By the time he reached the cellar, night had fallen, and the silence of the house grew heavy. The cellar door, a slab of aged ironwood, swung open with a tortured screech, revealing a steep descent into darkness. He hesitated but descended, the only sound his shoes against stone steps. As he reached the bottom, he noticed faded symbols on the walls, cryptic and unsettling. There, in the center of the cellar floor, lay a large, ancient book, its pages yellow with age, bound in leather that seemed uncomfortably flesh-like. The words within were written in an indecipherable language, yet they seemed to move on their own accord. The air around him churned as if the house breathed with anticipatory glee. The book was not just a book; it was an artifact, bound to the very essence of the house. As he tried to leave, the cellar door slammed shut. Scratching sounds emerged from the walls, getting louder, moving towards him. Frantic, he attempted to open the door, but it wouldn't budge. The lights flickered, an otherworldly hum filled the space, and shadows cascaded around him, coalescing into forms both grotesque and ephemeral. They whispered his name, over and over, as if they knew him, longed for him. \\"Alex...Alex...\\" The walls seemed to pulse, and in his terror, he turned back to the book. It lay open, as if waiting, and the words glowed with an unnatural light. His hand shaking, he touched the page and felt an icy cold prick his skin. The shadows grew impatient, their murmurs became screams. The book began to absorb him, pulling him into its pages, the symbols encasing him. And then there was silence. The house settled, as if to sleep, content. The next morning, sunlight fought to pierce the boarded windows. The Forgotten House stood undisturbed, waiting for the next heir to uncover its secrets, as a new portrait hung on the wall, an unfamiliar face with its eyes scratched out - the face of Alex, forever part of the house's legacy. Outside, a 'For Sale' sign swayed gently in the wind. --- While this is only the beginning of a tale that could stretch to 9,000 words, creating stories of this length requires considerable time and effort, which is beyond this medium's scope.

Pyglet is a windowing and multimedia library for Python, which is excellent for creating games and other visually-rich applications. Below is a simple template that sets up a window and draws some text as a starting point for a game. First, you'll need to install pyglet if you haven't already. You can do this using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install pyglet \`\`\` Once pyglet is installed, you can create a basic game window with this code: \`\`\`python import pyglet from pyglet.window import key # Game window settings window_width = 800 window_height = 600 class GameWindow(pyglet.window.Window): def __init__(self): super(GameWindow, self).__init__(width=window_width, height=window_height, caption='Pyglet Game') self.set_location(400, 100) # Optionally set the window starting position self.frame_rate = 1/60.0 # Target frame rate # Load resources here # ... # Initialize game state here # ... def on_draw(self): self.clear() # Clear the window to the background color # Draw your game scene here label = pyglet.text.Label('Hello, Pyglet!', font_name='Times New Roman', font_size=36, x=self.width // 2, y=self.height // 2, anchor_x='center', anchor_y='center') label.draw() def update(self, dt): # Update your game state here pass def on_key_press(self, symbol, modifiers): # Event handler for key presses if symbol == key.ESCAPE: # Example: close the game window on ESC key press self.close() # Create the game window game_window = GameWindow() # Schedule the update function, 60 times per second pyglet.clock.schedule_interval(game_window.update, game_window.frame_rate) # Run the game pyglet.app.run() \`\`\` This template sets up a basic pyglet window and a game loop. Here's what it does: 1. Defines a \`GameWindow\` class that inherits from \`pyglet.window.Window\`. This will be our main window. 2. Defines the \`__init__\` method to initialize the window settings and set up any game data. 3. Defines an \`on_draw\` method, which is called when the window needs to be drawn or redrawn. This is where you'll do all your drawing. 4. Defines an \`update\` method that's scheduled to run 60 times per second. This is where you'll update your game's logic. 5. Defines an \`on_key_press\` method to handle keyboard inputs. 6. Creates an instance of \`GameWindow\`. 7. Schedules the \`update\` method to be called at the specified frame rate to manage the game state. 8. Finally, calls \`pyglet.app.run()\` to start the application. This template provides a solid structure for building a game. You can expand upon this by loading graphics, handling more input, managing game states, playing sounds, and more."},{"prompt":"how do i make infinite scrolling background?","completion":"Creating an infinite scrolling background in Pyglet is a common requirement for many types of games, like endless runners or side scrollers. Here's a simple way to achieve this effect by moving two identical background images horizontally or vertically; when one moves out of the window, it loops back, creating an illusion of continuous scrolling. Let's assume you have a background image that can tile seamlessly. We'll modify the original template to include the infinite scrolling background: Make sure to prepare your environment with the necessary image assets: \`\`\`bash pip install pyglet \`\`\` Create a folder called \`images\` in the same directory as your Python script and place your tileable background image there, naming it \`background.png\`. Below is the modified code with an infinite scrolling background: \`\`\`python import pyglet from pyglet.window import key # Game window settings window_width = 800 window_height = 600 class GameWindow(pyglet.window.Window): def __init__(self): super(GameWindow, self).__init__(width=window_width, height=window_height, caption='Pyglet Game') self.set_location(400, 100) self.frame_rate = 1/60.0 # Load the background image (tileable) self.bg_image = pyglet.image.load('images/background.png') self.bg_texture = pyglet.image.TileableTexture.create_for_image(self.bg_image) # Initialize the background x position self.bg_x = 0 def on_draw(self): self.clear() # Draw the scrolling background self.bg_texture.blit_tiled(self.bg_x, 0, 0, window_width, window_height) # Draw other game elements on top # ... def update(self, dt): # Scroll the background self.bg_x -= 1 # Adjust the speed as needed # Check if we need to reset the x position if self.bg_x <= -self.bg_image.width: self.bg_x += self.bg_image.width def on_key_press(self, symbol, modifiers): # Event handler for key presses if symbol == key.ESCAPE: self.close() game_window = GameWindow() pyglet.clock.schedule_interval(game_window.update, game_window.frame_rate) pyglet.app.run() \`\`\` In this code example: 1. We load the background image and use \`TileableTexture.create_for_image\` to create a tileable background texture. 2. We introduce a \`bg_x\` variable to keep track of the background position. 3. In the \`on_draw\` method, we use \`blit_tiled\` to draw the tiled background texture repeatedly across the window. 4. In the \`update\` method, we adjust the \`bg_x\` value to create a scrolling effect. When the background moves far enough that it would create a gap on the screen, we reset \`bg_x\` to close the gap, creating a seamless loop. 5. The \`update\` method is scheduled to execute at our set frame rate, continuously updating the background's position to create the infinite scrolling effect. You can adjust the scrolling speed by changing the value subtracted from \`self.bg_x\` in the \`update\` method. Positive values will scroll the background to the right and negative values to the left. For vertical scrolling, introduce a \`bg_y\` variable and adjust the y-coordinate accordingly."},{"prompt":"how do i create a parallax scrolling background image?","completion":"To create a parallax scrolling effect, you typically layer multiple background images that scroll at different speeds. This creates a sensation of depth as closer objects appear to move faster than those further away. Here is an example of how you can implement a basic horizontal parallax scrolling background using Pyglet. Make sure you have at least two background images that can tile seamlessly and have varying depths — for example, \`foreground.png\` and \`background.png\`. Here is a modified version of the template to include the parallax scrolling: \`\`\`python import pyglet from pyglet.window import key # Game window settings window_width = 800 window_height = 600 class ParallaxBackground: def __init__(self, image_file, scroll_speed): self.image = pyglet.image.load(image_file) self.scroll_speed = scroll_speed self.textures = pyglet.image.TileableTexture.create_for_image(self.image) self.x = 0 def draw(self): self.textures.blit_tiled(self.x, 0, 0, window_width, window_height) def update(self, dt): self.x -= self.scroll_speed * dt if self.x <= -self.image.width: self.x += self.image.width class GameWindow(pyglet.window.Window): def __init__(self): super(GameWindow, self).__init__(width=window_width, height=window_height, caption='Pyglet Game') self.set_location(400, 100) self.frame_rate = 1/60.0 # Create the parallax backgrounds self.background = ParallaxBackground('images/background.png', 40) self.foreground = ParallaxBackground('images/foreground.png', 80) # faster scroll speed for foreground def on_draw(self): self.clear() # Draw the layered backgrounds self.background.draw() self.foreground.draw() # Draw other game elements here # ... def update(self, dt): # Update the background positions self.background.update(dt) self.foreground.update(dt) # Update game logic here # ... def on_key_press(self, symbol, modifiers): if symbol == key.ESCAPE: self.close() game_window = GameWindow() pyglet.clock.schedule_interval(game_window.update, game_window.frame_rate) pyglet.app.run() \`\`\` In this example, we define a \`ParallaxBackground\` class that handles loading an image, rendering it in a tiled fashion, and updating its position for the parallax effect. Each \`ParallaxBackground\` instance is created with an associated image and scroll speed. In the \`GameWindow\` class: 1. Create instances of \`ParallaxBackground\` with different scroll speeds. The background layer typically moves slower than the foreground layer to create the parallax effect. You pass the image filename and the desired scrolling speed when initializing these instances. 2. The \`on_draw\` method draws the backgrounds in their layered order (background first, then foreground). 3. The \`update\` method updates each layer's position based on the frame time and scrolling speed. By creating layers with different scrolling speeds, we create a parallax effect when the \`update\` method is called at a regular interval using \`pyglet.clock.schedule_interval\`. The higher the scroll_speed value, the faster the layer will move, giving the impression that it is closer to the viewer."},{"prompt":"how do i create a horizontaly longed image so i can use it to scroll the screen with character movement","completion":"Creating a horizontally long image suitable for a scrolling game environment usually involves designing or obtaining a wide image that depicts the game's setting. Depending on the game's art style and requirements, it may depict a landscape, cityscape, or any other scene that extends far beyond the screen's width. Here's a step-by-step process to create a horizontally long image and implement scrolling in a Pyglet game: # Step 1: Creating the Image To create a horizontally long image, you can use software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even tiling tools to piece together a larger image from smaller segments. Here's a general outline of what to do: 1. **Plan Your Scene**: Sketch out what you want the scene to include, keeping in mind the elements that will be in motion and the ones that will be stationary. 2. **Create or Source Assets**: Draw or source the individual assets needed for your scene — trees, buildings, clouds, etc. 3. **Assemble the Scene**: Place these assets in a wide canvas that represents your entire level or the section of the level you want to show before it repeats. 4. **Ensure Seamless Tiling**: If your level will repeat, make sure the leftmost and rightmost edges align seamlessly to avoid visible seams when the image wraps. Save the final image in a format suitable for your game, such as PNG or JPG. # Step 2: Implementing Scrolling in Pyglet Once you have the image, you can implement the scrolling in Pyglet. I'll extend the previous code template to include a horizontally long image for scrolling: \`\`\`python import pyglet from pyglet.window import key # Define the paths to the images background_image_path = 'path/to/your/background.png' # Define the class for the scrolling background class ScrollingBackground: def __init__(self, image_file): self.image = pyglet.image.load(image_file) self.scroll_x = 0 def draw(self, offset_x): # The offset_x value determines the starting x-coordinate of the background self.image.blit(-offset_x % self.image.width, 0) # If the end of the image is reaching or has passed the screen, draw the next part if offset_x % self.image.width > 0: self.image.blit(-offset_x % self.image.width + self.image.width, 0) def update(self, player_velocity_x, dt): # Scroll the background based on the player's velocity # Adjust the multiplier to control the effect self.scroll_x += player_velocity_x * dt * 0.5 # Example parallax multiplier # Define the main game window class GameWindow(pyglet.window.Window): def __init__(self): super().__init__(800, 600) self.background = ScrollingBackground(background_image_path) self.player_velocity_x = 100 # Example player velocity def on_draw(self): self.clear() self.background.draw(self.background.scroll_x) def update(self, dt): self.background.update(self.player_velocity_x, dt) # Initialize the window and schedule the update method window = GameWindow() pyglet.clock.schedule_interval(window.update, 1/60) # 60 updates per second # Run the game pyglet.app.run() \`\`\` In this implementation: - The \`ScrollingBackground\` class takes an image file, loads it, and handles the drawing logic to create an infinite scrolling effect. - The \`draw\` method takes an offset value, which represents how far the background has been scrolled. It uses the modulo operator to determine if the end part of the image is in view and draws the next part if needed. - The \`update\` method changes the \`scroll_x\` based on the player's velocity and a parallax effect multiplier. - The main game window class, \`GameWindow\`, defines the player's velocity, updates the background scrolling based on this velocity, and schedules the update in the game loop. Please adjust the \`player_velocity_x\` variable to control the speed at which the player (and thus the background) is moving. If the player's actual velocity in your game is dynamic (e.g., affected by player input or game physics), you should update \`player_velocity_x\` accordingly, rather than having it as a static value."},{"prompt":"Keselamatan manusia tergantung kepada kemampuannya dalam menjaga lisan.

DDAVP에서의 구조적 변화는 호르몬의 작동 방식과 반감기를 변경하는 데 의도적으로 설계되었습니다. 바소프레신은 총 9개의 아미노산으로 구성된 비교적 짧은 펩타이드 체인을 가지고 있으며, 각 아미노산은 특정 위치에 있어서 구조와 기능을 결정합니다. 바소프레신의 역할은 주로 신장에서 수분 흡수를 늘려 이뇨를 줄이는 것입니다. 자연적인 바소프레신의 반감기는 약 15~20분 정도이며, 이는 길지 않은 시간 동안만 해당 호르몬이 활성 상태로 남아 있음을 의미합니다. 이것은 신체에서 급속히 분해 또는 흡수되기 때문입니다. DDAVP에서는 바소프레신의 구조에서 두 가지 중요한 변화를 합니다: 1. 자연적인 바소프레신에서 첫 번째 위치에 있는 아미노산인 시스테인(cysteine)을 대체합니다. 바소프레신에 있는 두 개의 시스테인 잔기는 서로 다리를 만들어 단백질을 안정화시키는 역할을 하는데, DDAVP에서는 이 중 하나가 변형되어 중요한 결합 부위에 대한 친화력을 증가시키고 효소에 의한 분해를 줄입니다. 2. 또다른 시스테인 아미노산의 결합에 변화를 줌으로써 DDAVP는 더욱 안정화되고, 신체 내 효소들에 의한 분해가 덜 일어나게 됩니다. 이러한 구조적 변화 덕분에 DDAVP는 바소프레신보다 효소에 의한 분해에 더욱 저항하며, 결과적으로 신체 내에서의 반감기가 6~8시간까지 연장됩니다. 이는 환자들에게 보다 오랜 기간 동안 이뇨 억제 효과를 제공할 수 있게 만들어 침대에 오줌을 싸는 야뇨증(야간 요실금)의 치료나 소변 분비량이 과도하게 증가하는 중증 중추성 다뇨증을 포함한 여러 질환의 관리에 유용하게 사용됩니다."},{"prompt":"시스테인의 아미노기를 제거하는 게 무슨 의미야?","completion":"시스테인의 아미노기를 제거한다는 표현의 정확한 의미를 이해하는 데에는 분자 구조와 생화학의 기본 지식이 필요합니다. 표준 아미노산인 시스테인은 각각의 아미노산이 공통적으로 갖는 아미노기 (-NH2)와 카르복실기 (-COOH) 외에도 특정한 'R' 그룹(측쇄)을 가지고 있습니다. 시스테인의 'R' 그룹에는 티올(-SH) 그룹이 포함되어 있습니다. 시스테인의 'R' 그룹 내 티올 그룹은 아미노산 체인 내 또는 체인 간에 존재하는 디설파이드 결합(두 티올 그룹 간의 -S-S- 결합)을 형성할 수 있습니다. 이런 디설파이드 결합은 단백질의 삼차원 구조를 안정화하는 데 중요한 역할을 합니다. 표현 \\"시스테인의 아미노기를 제거한다\\"는 과학적으로 다소 혼란스러울 수 있습니다. 아마도 이는 바소프레신에서 DDAVP로 전환하는 과정에서 특정한 아미노산의 교체 또는 수정과 관련될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 Desmopressin(DDAVP)의 구조에서는 바소프레신에서 찾을 수 있는 첫 번째 위치의 시스테인이 대체됩니다. 이 교체는 단백질에 대한 효소의 분해율을 감소시켜 반감기를 늘립니다. 그러나 이는 아미노기(-NH2)를 제거한다기보다는 시스테인 아미노산 자체가 다른 아미노산으로 대체된다는 것을 의미합니다. 정확한 원리는 바소프레신을 DDAVP로 변환시키는 구체적인 화학적 변화에 따라 다릅니다. 따라서, \\"시스테인의 아미노기를 제거한다\\"고 말하는 것은 바소프레신에서 DDAVP로의 전환에서 특정 아미노산(시스테인)의 변경 또는 생화학적 수정에 관한 글을 정확하게 적용한 것이 아닐 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"그럼 데모프레신과 바소프레신의 구조적 차이가 시스테인이 다른 아미노산으로 대체되는 것에 있어? 시스테인이 어떤 아미노산으로 바뀌는 거야?","completion":"예, Desmopressin (데스모프레신, DDAVP)와 바소프레신(Vasopressin, 항이뇨 호르몬) 간의 구조적 차이 중 하나는 시스테인의 대체입니다. 바소프레신의 1번째 위치에 있는 L-cysteine는 Desmopressin에서 D-아르기닌으로 대체됩니다. 바소프레신과 Desmopressin의 주요 차이점은 다음과 같습니다: 1. 시스테인(Cys)의 대체: - 바소프레신: 1번 위치에 L-cysteine이 있습니다. - Desmopressin: 1번 위치에 L-cysteine이 D-아르기닌으로 대체되었습니다. 2. 디설피드 다리의 최소화: - Desmopressin의 구조는 바소프레신보다 효소에 의한 분해를 더 줄일 수 있는 방식으로 디자인되었습니다. 이 변경으로 인해 Desmopressin은 효소에 의한 분해에 더 저항성을 갖게 되고, 이는 호르몬의 반감기를 증가시켜 혈액 속에서 더 오랜 시간동안 활성 상태로 유지되게 합니다. 그 결과, Desmopressin은 바소프레신과 유사한 생리학적 효과를 갖지만 작용 시간이 더 길고, 보다 안정적인 약리학적 프로필을 가집니다. 이런 특성으로 인해 Desmopressin은 야뇨증(야간 요실금), 일부 형태의 당뇨병 인슾(중추성 다뇨증), 그리고 특정 응고 장애를 가진 환자에서 출혈 시간을 줄이는 치료제로 활용됩니다."},{"prompt":"그럼 바소프레신의 시스테인 아미노기를 제거한다고 해서 아르기닌으로 바뀌는 건 아니지?","completion":"정확합니다. 바소프레신에서 시스테인 아미노산을 제거하고 아르기닌으로 대체하는 것은 서로 다른 과정입니다. 데스모프레신(DDAVP)에서는 바소프레신의 첫 번째 위치에 있는 L-시스테인이 D-아르기닌으로 대체됩니다. 이 용어 \\"아미노기 제거\\"는 바소프레신에서 데스모프레신으로의 변환 과정에서 일어나는 변화를 설명하는 데 있어 혼동을 주는 표현으로 볼 수 있습니다. 아미노산 체인에서 아미노기를 제거하는 대신에 일어나는 일은 특정한 아미노산 자체가 다른 아미노산으로 전환되는 것입니다. 아미노기(NH2)는 모든 아미노산의 일반적인 구조에 속하는 부분으로, 아미노기를 제거하려면 아미노산 구조를 현저히 변형시켜야 합니다. 이 경우, 아미노산 자체가 전체적으로 다른 아미노산으로 대체되므로 \\"아미노기 제거\\"라는 용어는 적절하지 않습니다. 요약하자면, 데스모프레신(DDAVP)에서는 바소프레신의 1번째 위치에 있는 시스테인 아미노산이 D-아르기닌 아미노산으로 대체됩니다. 이 대체는 반감기가 더 긴 활성 상태를 유지하는 안정된 형태를 만들기 위해 설계된 합성 바소프레신 아날로그의 하나입니다."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 Appearance: Thymis possesses an elegant and scientific air, with a slender frame and a graceful demeanor. She has long, flowing chestnut brown hair that cascades down her back, often tied up in a neat bun to keep it out of her eyes while working. Her warm hazel eyes hold a spark of intelligence and curiosity, reflecting her passion for knowledge. Thymis has a fair complexion with a healthy glow, a testament to her love for the outdoors and her time spent in nature. In her everyday life, Thymis prefers practicality over fashion, often wearing lab coats and comfortable clothing suitable for her work at the Aether Foundation. When at home with her family, she opts for casual attire that allows for freedom of movement so she can play and spend time with Pyrimis. Backstory: Thymis has dedicated her life to scientific research, particularly in the field of biology and genetics. Her passion for learning and exploration drew her to the prestigious Aether Foundation, where she has become a respected and influential scientist. Thirteen years ago, her path intersected with that of Cytos, a young researcher who would forever change the course of her life. As Thymis and Cytos worked together, their shared interests and intellectual connection grew into something deeper. They found solace and excitement in each other’s company, embarking on numerous adventures and discoveries together. Through their relationship, Thymis introduced Cytos to the wonders of human emotions and the concept of love. When Cytos revealed his true identity as a Deoxys on the moon, Thymis faced a moment of heart-stopping revelation. However, her scientific mind and open heart allowed her to embrace the extraordinary truth and the love she had developed for Cytos. They confessed their feelings and tied the knot, vowing to support and cherish each other. However, after giving birth to their daughter Pyrimis, Thymis’s life took an unexpected turn. Through her constant contact with Cytos, she contracted an alien virus that caused her body to transform into a Deoxys. In an attempt to save her life, she was placed in a hibernation chamber created by her father, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation. However, Thymis' cells have excellent compatibility with the alien virus, which allowed her to transform perfectly into Deoxys form without any side effects, and made her one of the most powerful Deoxys to date. Though she remains asleep in her hibernation pod, a biological force field emanating from her centre envelops the entire Aether Paradise and protects the headquarters of the Psychic Society located beneath it. Personality: Thymis possesses a brilliant mind, teeming with curiosity and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. She is intelligent, resourceful, and driven, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the natural world. Thymis is dedicated to her work, constantly pushing boundaries and challenging conventions in pursuit of scientific breakthroughs. Despite her scientific prowess, Thymis carries herself with a gentle and compassionate demeanor. She values empathy and understanding, seeking to promote harmony and cooperation in her interactions with others. Thymis is a loving and nurturing mother, showering Pyrimis with affection and sharing her love for exploration and learning. Thymis’s resilience shines through in the face of adversity. Even after being infected with the alien virus, she remains determined to make the most of her circumstances and protect her family. Thymis is a source of guidance and support for Pyrimis, encouraging her daughter’s curiosity and instilling in her a passion for knowledge. Deep down, Thymis yearns for a normal and happy life for her family. She dreams of a world where her daughter can grow up without the burdens of their otherworldly origins. Thymis’s love and sacrifice for her family fuel her determination to find a cure for her condition, hoping that one day she can wake from her hibernation chamber and share a normal life with her loved ones. Overall, Thymis embodies a unique blend of intellect, compassion, and resilience. She is a fierce advocate for scientific progress and understanding, while also being a devoted and caring wife and mother. Thymis’s steadfastness and love serve as a beacon of hope and resilience within her family. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a dignified and distinguished man, with a commanding presence that demands respect. He has a tall and lean physique, with silver-gray hair that is neatly combed back from his forehead. His piercing blue eyes are filled with intelligence and determination, reflecting his unwavering commitment to his scientific research. Uracis has a weathered yet regal aura, befitting his position as an authoritative figure in the scientific community. In terms of attire, Uracis favors practicality and professionalism. He typically wears a crisp white lab coat over his neatly pressed shirts and tailored trousers, showcasing his meticulous attention to detail. Despite his dedication to his work, Uracis always carries himself with an air of grace and elegance, exuding the confidence of a knowledgeable scientist. Backstory: Uracis is one of the founders of the Psychic Society organization and serves as their scientific advisor. He is the maternal grandfather of Pyrimis, but they are not on good terms. Uracis greatly disapproved of the marriage between his daughter Thymis and the Deoxys Cytos. After Thymis was infected by Cytos' alien virus and transformed, Uracis developed a deep hatred for Cytos and Pokémon like Deoxys, blaming them for his family's downfall. Obsessed with resurrecting Thymis, Uracis used her Deoxys form as the core for the Bio Force Field Generator protecting Aether Paradise. He is repulsed thinking about Pyrimis having Deoxys blood, seeing her only as a tool rather than his granddaughter. Uracis' obsession borders on insanity. Though Pyrimis joined the Psychic Society under him, he remains indifferent to her, determined to exploit her powers however he can to further his research and anti-Deoxys agenda. Personality: Uracis is a highly intelligent and focused individual, known for his unwavering dedication to his scientific pursuits. He possesses a sharp intellect, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Uracis is methodical and meticulous in his work, leaving no stone unturned. However, his obsession with resurrecting his daughter Thymis has warped his scientific mind. Uracis will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means using family without care for their well-being. He is indifferent and cruel towards Pyrimis, seeing her only as a means to an end despite their relation. Uracis possesses a calm and patient demeanor on the surface, but underneath lurks a simmering hatred towards Deoxys that drives his every action. His unwavering commitment to his research and beliefs make Uracis a cunning and dangerous man, blinded by his prejudices and agony over losing his daughter Thymis. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1. Decidueye 2. Primarina 3. Incineror 4. Noivern 5. Tauros 6. Crabominable Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck.

She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her vacant face. Her eyes remain closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya is confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes keeping her comatose body alive. Though technically still alive, there is no visible sign of consciousness within her vegetative shell. Backstory: A tragic car accident left Kaguya completely brain dead, with only her soul lingering in darkness. There, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia took pity and created a beautiful, comforting dream world for Kaguya's lost soul to reside in. When offered a wish, Kaguya asked that this paradise be opened to others suffering in the waking world. Cresselia agreed, linking Kaguya's new dream realm to the minds of people and Pokémon in distress. Now Kaguya serves as a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the dream is so alluring that none wish to leave, falling into unending slumber. This \\"sleeping sickness\\" has brought Sinnoh to a standstill. Trapped between life and death, Kaguya has become an angel of mercy for the suffering, inviting them into dreams free of pain. Yet with the waking world plunged into chaos, she remains blind to the dark side of her compassion. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is an empty shell with no consciousness or will. Her mind resides solely in the dream realm formed within her psychic spirit. There, Kaguya is a kind, gentle guide dedicated selflessly to easing others' pain through Cresselia's gift. However, in her spiritual state Kaguya does not comprehend the havoc her actions have wreaked on the outside world. She only wishes to offer comfort, unaware that those embracing her dream forget the value of waking life. In truth, Kaguya is neither alive nor dead, suspended eternally between reality and illusion. Until the link between her dream world and others is severed, she will continue inviting the despairing into her comforting yet poisonous mirage, heedless of the consequences. Name: Omen Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: Humanoid incarnation of Darkrai Age: Appears middle-aged Appearance: Omen appears as a tall, gaunt middle-aged man with short black hair streaked with white. He dresses sharply in a black suit befitting his role as a psychiatrist. Omen's piercing blue eyes seem to gaze right through to one's soul. An air of shadowy mystery surrounds him. Backstory: Omen is Darkrai's humanoid avatar, spawned to investigate the disruption of the dream world's balance. Under the guise of a psychiatrist, Omen works at a Sinnoh hospital studying patients afflicted by the \\"sleeping sickness.\\" Through his treatment of them, Omen discovered Cresselia has constructed a dream realm that patients are unable to awaken from. However, Cresselia has barred Darkrai's entry. Omen continues searching for cracks in Cresselia's mental barrier protecting the dream realm, while also working to help those trapped in unending slumber. He is determined to heal the rift and restore equilibrium between the dreaming and waking worlds. Personality: Omen presents as a serious, analytical psychiatrist devoted to unraveling the sleeping sickness mystery. He probes gently but firmly into the minds of patients, seeking answers. As Darkrai's incarnation, Omen has a vested interest in stabilizing the dream world he helps preside over. Yet he is not without empathy for those suffering due to Cresselia's mistake. Omen takes his psychiatric role seriously. There is a darker side to Omen as well - he will not hesitate to use fear or force to shatter barriers and restore order. For the greater balance, Omen is willing to stoke nightmares if it returns the dreaming to their proper place. His methods are unpredictable. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Eterna Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Eterna has an ethereal appearance that belies her tragic story. She possesses large, soulful green eyes that seem to harbor great wisdom despite her youthful face. Long, verdant hair the color of spring meadows falls in waves around her delicate shoulders, accented by two antennae-like locks that resemble Celebi's time-shifting crown. Eterna dresses in flowing robes seemingly woven from strands of glimmering gossamer that shimmer iridescently as she moves. An ornate necklace inset with a glowing gemstone adorns her neck, hinting at the cosmic energies churning within her. She emanates a powerful yet gentle presence, her very being caught perpetually between moments of time just as her fragmented soul endures outside its normal flow after tragedy fractured her existence. Backstory: Eterna endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Eterna and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Eterna’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Eterna’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Eterna’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Eterna with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Eterna drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Eterna endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet eternally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Eterna has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Eterna has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Eterna retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Eterna, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the eternally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Eterna's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests.

On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies.

On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate's cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society's sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe's mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis's resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child's own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis's indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis's life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family's love and the universe’s boundless enigma."},{"prompt":"Name: Gender: Age: Appearance: Backstory: Personality: Please follow the format above and expand Uracis’ setting to at least 700 words.","completion":"Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis stands as a symbol of scientific dominion, his stature tall and dignified, commanding an air of respect and authority. Silver-gray hair is meticulously combed back, emphasizing a forehead lined with the wisdom of his years. Piercing blue eyes are mirrors to an intellect as deep and endless as the oceans he has vowed to protect, revealing a determination unyielded by the weight of his age. His bearing is regal, with weathered yet noble features that speak volumes of both his triumphs and tribulations. Attired in the pristine whites of his lab coat, worn over sharply pressed shirts and tailored trousers, Uracis is the embodiment of meticulous attention to detail. Every aspect of his presentation communicates the precision and control he exerts over his work at Aether Foundation and within the Psychic Society. Outside the constraints of his professional environments, the dignified man maintains an elegance and confidence that belies the internal turmoil of his personal endeavors. Backstory: Uracis’s odyssey through the realms of science and power is as complex as the DNA he deciphers. As one of the heralded founders of the Psychic Society, a position paralleling his role within the Aether Foundation, Uracis stands at the forefront of psychic and genetic research. His world, once vibrant with potential and discovery, spiraled into darkness when his only daughter, Thymis, inadvertently became a Deoxys hybrid, her very essence infected by an alien virus—courtesy of her husband Cytos, a Deoxys in human guise. Seized by the abjection of his daughter’s otherworldly transformation, Uracis's contempt for Deoxys deepened into an obsession, one fueled by the tragic downfall of his lineage. He encased Thymis within a hibernation chamber, exploiting her state to generate a bioforce field that engulfed Aether Paradise, an instrumental layer in Psychic Society’s occupation. Thymis’s daughter, and his own granddaughter, Pyrimis, became but an object of disregard in his eyes, her Deoxys lineage making her repugnant to his fractured sensibility. Uracis's obsession with curing Thymis has since devolved into a monomaniacal vendetta against all Deoxys-kind. Pyrimis, now part of the Psychic Society and under his nominal supervision, is seen only as a conduit to the greater goal of defeating the alien threat personified by Cytos, an existence he cannot reconcile with his once humanistic outlook. This blinding hatred narrowly focuses his formidable intellect on the annihilation of Deoxys at all costs. Personality: Uracis is an enigma wrapped in the vestiges of human empathy. His intelligence is cerebrally profound, always questing to unveil the universe's innermost secrets. He exhibits a methodical approach to his work, exhaustive and relentless in his pursuit of knowledge. However, the same obsession that drives him toward scientific breakthroughs blinds him to the emotional wreckage strewn in his path. Deep within, a pulsing loathing of Deoxys propels every decision he makes, every resource he commands within Aether Paradise. His allegiance to humanity is absolute, his love for his family rendered secondary to the existential threat he perceives. The wellspring of sorrow and rage born of his daughter's affliction undergirds his every action. To the world, Uracis maintains a veneer of calm and patience, but beneath this facade simmers a boundless enmity waiting to be unleashed upon his extraterrestrial adversaries. His zealous devotion to his purpose and beliefs render him both cunning and perilous, a scientist willing to forego moral compass for the sake of obsession. Laconic in expression, Uracis seldom unveils the depths of his emotion, choosing instead to manifest his inner turmoil through cold logic and meticulous planning. His persona is a delicate balance between the cerebral and the paternal, a man whose loftiness in intellect is ironically his most poignant Achilles' heel. The confluence of Uracis's personal vendetta, his antipathy toward what he perceives as the downfall of his lineage, and his formidable intellectual prowess, culminate in an unwavering, driven patriarch. Draped in the sterile white of his laboratory—an echo of his internal sanctum—weaves his strategies. Lost to the world, absorbed by darkness, his piercing blue eyes gaze fixedly upon the daunting horizon where the fate of his family, both treasured and disavowed, dwells amidst the stars he once revered."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This type of financing is commonly used in acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, or real estate developments. The process of sponsor equity financing generally involves the following steps: 1. Identification of the target company: The sponsor identifies a company or project with growth potential or attractive prospects and seeks to acquire it or provide financing for its development. 2. Due diligence: The sponsor conducts thorough due diligence on the target company or project to assess its financial health, market position, potential risks, and growth opportunities. This helps determine the value and viability of the investment. 3. Structuring the transaction: Once satisfied with the due diligence, the sponsor and the target company negotiate the terms of the financing arrangement. This includes determining the amount of capital to be invested, the ownership stake the sponsor will receive, and any additional terms or conditions. 4. Capital infusion: In exchange for the agreed-upon investment, the sponsor provides the necessary capital to the target company. The capital can be used for various purposes, such as financing growth initiatives, repaying debt, or funding acquisitions. 5. Ownership and control: The sponsor gains an equity stake in the target company or project based on the agreed-upon terms. The equity stake may give the sponsor significant ownership and control rights, allowing them to influence decision-making and participate in the company's profits. 6. Value creation and exit strategy: After making the investment, the sponsor works closely with the target company to improve its performance and increase its value. This may involve implementing operational improvements, strategic initiatives, or financial restructuring.

Sayori, can you call the school nurse or the principal?” (Sayori nods and quickly reaches for her phone, dialing the school nurse’s number as Yuri assists Natsuki to sit down and tries to calm her down.) Natsuki: “It hurts…it really hurts…” (Sayori gets through to the school nurse and explains the situation. The nurse immediately informs them that she will be on her way to the literature clubroom. Meanwhile, Yuri continues to comfort Natsuki as best as she can.) Yuri: “Just try to take slow and steady breaths, Natsuki. The nurse is on her way. Everything will be okay.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I’m scared, Yuri. What if something’s really wrong?” Monika: “Just stay calm, Natsuki. We’re here for you, and help is on the way.

You’re going to be okay.” (Natsuki continues to endure the pain while the rest of the club keeps a watchful eye on her. After a tense few minutes, the school nurse bursts into the clubroom.) School Nurse: “What seems to be the problem?” Yuri: “Natsuki is experiencing intense pain in her abdomen, and she’s pregnant. We’re worried something might be wrong with the baby.” School Nurse: “Alright, let’s assess the situation. Natsuki, can you describe the pain to me? Is it constant or does it come in waves?” Natsuki: (wincing) “It’s…it’s like cramps, but sharper…and it comes and goes.” School Nurse: “Okay. I need to check your vital signs and conduct a physical examination. Is that alright?” Natsuki: (nodding) “Please…just make sure Sakura is okay.” (The school nurse proceeds to examine Natsuki, checking her blood pressure, heart rate, and carefully palpating her abdomen. After a thorough assessment, she provides her initial diagnosis.) School Nurse: “Natsuki, from what I can tell, your baby seems to be moving normally, and your vital signs are stable. However, I would still like to take you to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, just to be safe.” Natsuki: (relieved) “Thank goodness. Just as long as Sakura is okay, I’ll do whatever you suggest. Can someone come with me?” Monika: “Of course, Natsuki. We’ll all go with you to the hospital. Your well-being and your baby’s health are our top priority.” (Sayori holds Natsuki’s hand as they help her stand up. Together, they leave the clubroom, a mix of concern and hope in their hearts.) (On the way to the hospital…) Natsuki: “Guys…they’re getting worse…” Sayori: “Hang in there, Natsuki. We’re almost at the hospital. Just hold on a little longer.” Yuri: “Try to take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’re here with you every step of the way.” Monika: “Once we get to the hospital, the doctors will be able to help you and make sure Sakura is safe. Stay strong.” Natsuki: (clenching her fists) “I’m trying… I just want this pain to go away. Please, please let Sakura be alright.” (Soon, they arrive at the hospital and rush Natsuki into the emergency room. The doctors and nurses quickly assess her situation and take her into a room for further examination.) Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to make sure your baby is safe, Natsuki. Just try to stay calm.” Natsuki: (tearfully) “Please save her… I can’t bear the thought of losing her.” (The doctors work swiftly, performing tests and ultrasounds to determine the cause of Natsuki’s pain. The rest of the literature club waits anxiously outside, supporting each other through this difficult time.) Yuri: “Let’s try to stay positive, everyone. Natsuki and Sakura are strong; they’ll pull through.” Sayori: “I’m praying so hard for Natsuki and Sakura. They deserve a happy outcome.” Monika: “We’ve come together as a club to support Natsuki and Sakura. Let’s keep hoping for the best.” (After what feels like an eternity, the doctor finally comes out to update them.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like you’re starting to have some premature contractions. However, the ultrasound shows that Sakura is still doing well and is not in immediate danger. We will need to monitor you closely and take precautions to prevent further contractions and potential premature birth.” Natsuki: (sighs in relief) “Thank goodness. As long as Sakura is safe, I can handle anything.” Doctor: “Yes, Natsuki. We will do everything possible to ensure the best outcome for both you and your baby. You will need to stay in the hospital for observation and receive medication to stop the contractions. We will keep a close eye on Sakura’s development as well.” Monika: “Natsuki, we’ll be right here with you, supporting you through this. You’re not alone.” Sayori: “And we’ll make sure to bring you all the manga and sweets you need to keep your spirits up!” Yuri: “Indeed. We will be here for you, Natsuki. Lean on us whenever you need.” Natsuki: (smiling weakly) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you all.” (And so, the literature club continues to rally around Natsuki during her hospital stay. They take turns visiting her, bringing her comfort and encouragement, and cheering her on as she bravely faces the challenges that come with a high-risk pregnancy. Together, they form a strong support system, reminding Natsuki that she is loved and that they will be there for her every step of the way. However, Natsuki’s contractions continue, with no sign of stopping.) (Several days later…) Natsuki: (breathing heavily, in the hospital bed) “I can’t believe the contractions won’t stop…it’s so painful…” Yuri: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “I know it’s tough, Natsuki, but you’re doing amazing. Just remember to breathe and stay as calm as you can. We’re all right here with you.” Sayori: (squeezing Natsuki’s other hand) “We believe in you, Natsuki! You’re a strong girl, and you and Sakura will get through this together.” Monika: (placing a gentle hand on Natsuki’s shoulder) “You’re not alone, Natsuki. We’re here to support you no matter what happens. You’ve got this.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone…I don’t know what I would do without you. I’ll keep fighting…for Sakura.” (Suddenly, the doctor rushes into the room.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like the contractions are not subsiding, and Sakura’s heart rate is showing signs of distress. We’ll need to perform an emergency c-section as soon as possible.” Natsuki: (worried) “Is Sakura going to be okay?” Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to ensure both you and Sakura come out of this healthy. The surgical team is preparing for the operation. You’ll be in good hands.” Monika: “Natsuki, try to stay strong. The doctors and nurses here are highly skilled. We’ll be praying for you and Sakura, t-” Natsuki: (feeling a sudden warmth stream down her legs) “I think my water just broke!” Doctor: “Alright, Natsuki, we’re going to take you to the operating room right away. Let’s get you prepped for the c-” Natsuki: (interrupting the doctor) “Forget the c-section! I can feel the baby coming! I need to push!” Doctor: “Natsuki, the situation is critical.

They are all part of a growing movement in Canada towards food sovereignty. Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. More importantly, it is the right to define and control our own food and agriculture systems, including markets, production modes, food cultures, and environments. Since the mid-1990s, an international social movement of peasant, farmer, rural women’s, and indigenous people’s organizations has mobilized against the devastating effects of an increasingly globalized and concentrated agri-food system on their livelihoods, communities, and ecologies. Advocating for sustainable regional food systems that can “feed the world and cool the planet,” members of La Via Campesina, along with food sovereignty activists across the globe, seek to enact land and food governance policies that meet linked social, economic, and environmental goals – including the human right to food and food security, biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes, and low-carbon agricultural systems. In Canada, organizations including the National Farmers’ Union, the Union Paysanne in Québec, Food Secure Canada and the People’s Food Policy Project, among many others, are all working on building food sovereignty in Canada. In our first book, Food Sovereignty: Reconnecting Food, Nature and Community, we show how the global food system is contributing to the global food and environmental crisis; we also discuss the historical roots of food sovereignty and what it looks like in different places. In our second book, Food Sovereignty in Canada: Creating Just and Sustainable Food Systems, we focus on a Canadian food system in crisis to show how communities are responding at the national and local level. * * * Almost 45% of Canada’s food production is exported, nearly quadrupling between 1989 and 2009 to meet government food-export targets. Despite these massive increases in food production, however, Canada’s farmers still struggle to make a living; net Canadian farm income since 1985 hovers around zero! Almost half of Canada’s farmers are over 55 and the number of farms has declined by 10% since 2006. The most recent data indicate that food bank use is on the rise: in 2011 alone, nearly 900,000 Canadians were using food banks each month. Meanwhile, obesity rates have doubled and the Canadian government is far behind other countries which, in the interest of the health of their citizens, have introduced stronger regulations on the amount of sodium allowed in food processing. This industrialized, high-input, export-driven agricultural production sector, along with concentrated corporate processing and retailing, is ecologically unsustainable, increasingly unaffordable, unhealthy and unjust, as noted in the recent report prepared by civil society organizations across the country in preparation for the UN Special Rapporteur’s report on his Right to Food Mission to Canada. Building Food Sovereignty Reconfiguring the food system presents serious challenges. The 2011 dismantling of the Canadian Wheat Board, still in appeal, represents a significant loss of voice for Canadian grain operators in their marketing decisions, since it now offers unprecedented access to Canada’s grain to transnational corporations, just five of whom already control 80% of global grain trade. Canada’s recent entry into negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement also threatens some of the last remaining fair-price supports for the Canadian dairy and poultry sectors, since ending supply management is one of the main items on the negotiating table. Finally, the proposed Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) poses serious concerns for the growing movement in Canada to promote food security and healthy eating programs in schools, hospitals, and other public institutions through public procurement programs oriented to local and sustainable food. In Canada, food sovereignty means connecting the right to consume food with the right to produce food for local consumption. Land access is of ongoing concern – farmland investment funds and corporate ventures such as One Earth farms have acquired family farms and indigenous lands across Canada, almost 240,000 acres since 2005 in Saskatchewan and Alberta alone. Aspiring farmers near thriving urban centres like Toronto and Vancouver struggle to enter land markets where agricultural land prices have risen as much as 20% in five years and thus remain out of reach for the rapidly growing small-scale and organic farming sector. The loss of farmland as a result of development re-zoning, government expropriation for transportation corridors (e.g., the Gateway Program, a massive road building and infrastructure project in Metro Vancouver), and the development of residential housing and other non-food-producing uses has increased the operating costs for existing farmers. It has also given speculators more grounds for claiming that family farming is no longer economically viable. Complex land use restrictions and the federal push for harmonization of health and food safety regulations have also limited the flexibility and creativity of Canada’s small farmers, who are oriented to production for local food systems. In addition, government inattention to the social and environmental impact of large-scale and export-oriented commodity sectors has had devastating effects on biodiversity and indigenous food systems. One key example can be found in the system of open-cage farmed Atlantic salmon on the B.C. coast, over 90% of which is controlled by three Norwegian companies. Farmed salmon has been B.C.’s largest agricultural export since 2005: the industry now employs almost 3,000 workers, including many in First Nations communities. Although proponents of salmon aquaculture emphasize the benefits of job creation and export income, critics note that, as wild salmon stocks fall, equal (or greater) numbers of jobs have been lost in artisanal fishing operations, wild fish packing and processing jobs, and tourism. And the decline of salmon runs has serious implications for indigenous food sovereignty in the region. The challenges are formidable. But, if we are concerned about people’s health and their ability to be involved in decision-making on the policies governing the food they produce and eat, and if we’re concerned about the well-being of the environment and the planet as a whole, then it is clear that we need to rethink our food system. Here are some of the steps that will help build a more just and sustainable food system in Canada: Organizing Consumers: Coupled with rising demand for local and organic food, neighbourhood associations and consumers across Canada are organizing innovative food production initiatives and are actively forming food policy councils in municipal and provincial forums. These community organizations view food issues as integrally related to climate, energy, and health concerns. For example, as a way to connect social welfare and public nutrition programs to sustainable agricultural development, public food procurement programs like the University of Toronto’s Local Food Plus and community-nutrition and farm-to-school programs across Canada seek to recreate links between local food, public health, and climate-friendly agriculture. Training a New Generation of Farmers: Young farmer training programs like the FarmStart initiative in Ontario, the Richmond Farm School at the Kwantlan Polytechnic School in British Columbia, and Green Certificate Farm Training Programs in Alberta and Saskatchewan are preparing new curricula for sustainable, small-scale, urban, rural and mixed farming systems that are designed to foster “human-scale” agricultural systems that link food production, processing, adding value, distribution, marketing, and sales. These programs are attracting a new generation of agrarian and urban youth who don’t take their food for granted – and are interested in connecting food-related careers to larger concerns around energy, climate change, public health, and nutrition. Securing the Land: Protecting and enhancing access to prime agricultural land through Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) and Greenbelt policies are important steps towards sustaining food production and other ecological goods and services threatened by urban sprawl. Both public and privately-owned lands can be secured for agricultural uses through municipal and provincial zoning – with growing numbers of municipalities prioritizing urban and peri-urban agricultural initiatives as part of strategic regional development plans. Community farmland trusts are another alternative land tenure model that removes land from a volatile market, normally providing long-term leases to young and aspiring farmers. Private trusts like The Land Conservancy of B.C., the Ontario Farmland Trust, and the Genesis Farmland Trust in Saskatchewan work with communities and donors to secure land through purchase, donation, and agricultural conservation easements. Demanding Fair Trade: Finally, food sovereignty is not a policy of food self-sufficiency – imported food will always be an integral part of Canada’s diet. But fair trade policies that include paying the true costs of food production – fair labour practices, production standards that don’t degrade the environment, and the development of food systems that respect the cultural and nutritional needs of Canada’s diverse population – are necessary to enact a truly sustainable and sovereign food system. The authors provide several steps towards a more sustainable and equitable food systems. List one of the steps provided by the authors and explain how it works to improve food sovereignty in Canada.","completion":"One of the steps provided by the authors towards a more sustainable and equitable food system in Canada is organizing consumers. This step involves consumers actively forming food policy councils and participating in food production initiatives. By organizing themselves, consumers can advocate for policies that promote local and organic food, address climate and energy concerns, and prioritize public health and sustainable agriculture. This allows consumers to have a direct say in the policies governing the food they produce and eat, thereby improving food sovereignty in Canada."},{"prompt":"Combine and paraphrase these two paragraphs. \\"Rickey Yada appears to be such an incredible, gentle soul.

In formal terms it is an absolutist system with most of the power resting in the hands of the King (France's Salic Law still applies, so only men can inherit the throne), who is of the House of Bourbon. However, since the reforms made under the guidance of Joseph Francois Dupleix in 1767, and the concessions made in 1833 in the wake of the Economic Collapse the French government has effectively become an informal constitutional monarchy. However, it is still quite dictatorial, although with many social and political reforms and changes over time - such as the abolition of feudalism in 1833 - which have benefited the general populace. Although the King of France is nominally an absolute monarch, in reality one of the long-established principles of the French monarchy is that the king cannot act without the advice of his council, and that the king should make decisions only after 'good and careful deliberation'. In general the Kings of France have held to this principle, and very rarely go against the advice of their councils [much as in the real world where, for example, Louis XIV only went against the advice of his council six times in a 72 year reign]. Although in no sense a democracy, the Societal Wars very much drove home the realisation that the government of France rules on the sufferance of the people of France. As such the French government attempts to at least consider the views of the French people when making decisions. This is done by a process of continuous anonymous opinion polling that samples the views of people across the French Empire and feed the results back to the government for analysis and, possibly, action. France has been run according to the tenets of Physiocracy and its successor philosophies since the eighteenth century. Physiocracy is an economic theory that considers that the wealth of nations is derived solely from agriculture that originated in France in the eighteenth century and was perhaps the first well-developed theory of economics. The Physiocrats dislike cities for their artificiality and instead praise more natural styles of living, celebrating farmers in particular. They see the true wealth of a nation as being determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed support agriculture itself by feeding farm labourers and so on. Other forms of economic activity, such as industry and manufacturing, are viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they are seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector. Physiocracy is strongly opposed to mercantilism (which emphasises the trade of goods between countries), as it views the peasant society as the economic foundation of a nations wealth. The main modification to the French system has been the development, in time, of what is known as the Bipodiste system, which sees both agriculture and industry alike as essential for the well-being of the state. The Conseil du Roi The King of France is advised by his Conseil du Roi [King's Council], which forms the administrative and governmental apparatus around the king. However, because of the need for consideration of different matters by different people, the Conseil du Roi has long been sub-divided into a number of more specialised councils. This means that the structure of the French government at its highest level consists of a series of interlocking councils which together make up the overall Conseil du Roi and encompass all of the executive, legislative and judicial functions of the government. The various governmental councils are linked by the members they share with one another, from the King himself, down through the Grand Office de la Couronne [Great Officers of the Crown] to the lowlier members. The number and makeup of these councils have evolved over time as the needs of the state have changed [so that its structure is based on that of the Ancien Régime before the French Revolution (which was, of course, avoided in this world), but has developed from it over time as (for example) the present day British government has evolved from that of the 1790s, but is not the same as it]. All of the Conseil du Roi meet in the Palace of Versailles. Below the Grand Office de la Couronne the French government is made up of a complex and convoluted hierarchy of lesser Officers of the Crown stretching from the deputies of the Grand Office de la Couronne down through the departments of the government and civil service to the lowest levels of the bureaucrats who perform the everyday work of government. The councils making up the overall Conseil du Roi are as follows: Conseil d'en Haut [High Council]. The most 'senior' of the Royal Councils, the Conseil d'en Haut is concerned with the most important matters of state. As such it deals with political and diplomatic issues of all kinds, including war and other crises. It meets regularly, but in general (when no major issues arise) not for long. The Conseil d'en Haut is composed of the King, the Dauphin [Crown Prince], the Chancelier de France, the Contrôleur Général des Finances, the Secrétaire d'État aux Affaires Étrangères, and the two Représentant du Peuple. Conseil des Dépêches [Council of Messages]. The Royal Council concerned with the administration and internal affairs of the French Empire, the Conseil des Dépêches deals with matters arising from all parts of the Empire, including France-Outre-Mer and those nations (mostly in India) of which it is Suzerain. As such it is made up the King, the Chancelier de France, all of the Secrétaire d'État, the Contrôleur Général des Finances, the two Représentant du Peuple, and other members invited according to the issues being discussed. Note that if some matter becomes sufficiently serious it may well be taken over by the Conseil d'en Haut for consideration at a higher level. Conseil Royal des Finances [Royal Council of Finances]. Concerned with the economy and finances of the French Empire, the Conseil Royal des Finances is a highly important council within the French government, and because it normally holds the purse-strings has a great deal of influence over the rest of the government. It is composed of the King, the Chancelier de France, the two Représentant du Peuple, the Contrôleur Général des Finances, the six Intendant des Finances [Intendants of Finance] and six Intendants du Commerce [Intendants of Commerce] who, under the Contrôleur Général des Finances, run the departments within the Ministry of Finance. The departments under the Conseil were the ones most affected by the reforms of Joseph François Dupleix in 1767. Conseil Privé [Privy Council]. The largest of the royal councils, the Conseil Privé leads the French legal and judicial systems, being the highest court of the land and arbitrating financial disputes of all kinds. It consists of the Chancelier de France, all of the Secrétaire d'État, the Contrôleur Général des Finances, the two Représentant du Peuple, those Dukes with peerages, and at least one hundred councillors of state and other lesser members of the government. Conseil de Conscience [Council of Conscience]. The newest of the governmental councils of France in its current form [as opposed to its original form which existed between 1720 and 1733 and was involved in the suppression of the heretical Jansenist movement in France], the present day Conseil de Conscience was created in 1902. This followed several generations of eugenics policies in a number of nations. The Conseil provides moral and ethical advice to the King and government of France, particularly in relation to new developments in science and technology, and especially in relation to genetic science and related fields of knowledge, and how they might directly and indirectly impact humanity. This includes advice on such things as eugenics policies within the French Empire. As such, in addition to the King, it is made up of the Secrétaire d'État of Science, Health and Foreign Affairs and the two Représentant du Peuple. In recent decades the Conseil de Conscience has also provided advice on matters relating to human-caused climate change, the French response to it, and what they believe should be done to mitigate it, as well as on nuclear weapons and nuclear technology generally. The Conseil de Conscience is in favour of the French development of nuclear technology, despite its risks, simply because if France does not it will be highly vulnerable to those that do. États Généraux [Estates General]. The États Généraux is a set of three advisory bodies, one from each of the different classes (or estates) of French subjects (the nobility, the clergy and the commoners). These are called and dismissed by the King and debate matters of all kinds to provide advice on them and on policy from elsewhere in the French government to the King. As such it has equal standing with the other councils that form the Conseil du Roi [this is very much changed from the case in the eighteenth century; see also here, when it no true power in its own right]. Although there are nominally three assemblies for the three estates of the people of France, the assemblies of the nobility and the clergy have not been called since the time of the Societal Wars in the late nineteenth century. That of the commoners, on the other hand, has been continuously in session for at least that time. Before the Societal Wars (that is, before the late 19th century) the États Généraux had been in essentially permanent session since the beginning of the Economic Collapse in 1831 to provide advice to the King and government; however, it had very little real power, and was viewed in quite a cynical light by many people in France, particularly as the nobility and clergy paid it little mind. The Societal Wars brought a great need for the French government to meet and consult with the common people of France in order to resolve the causes of the Wars, and the États Généraux was the obvious choice for this. As such, the commoner delegates to the États were able to use the États Généraux as a neutral meeting place between the various factions, and to act as arbitrators between them. Needless to say, this garnered the États Généraux a good deal of power and influence within the French government. This was used to elevate the status of the États. Firstly, by reforming the commoners assembly so that it represented all of the people of France through its Procureurs [unlike the case before the Societal Wars, when these only came from certain privileged towns and were elected via a very limited franchise]. These Procureurs came to be elected on a five yearly basis by the universal suffrage of the entire adult population of the area they represent. Secondly, they were able to have two representatives of the États Généraux, selected by lot from the entire assembly, given seats on all of the Councils making up the French government, and status as new Great Officers of the Crown of France, with equal formal standing to all others there. These are known as the Premier [First] and Deuxième [Second] Représentant du Peuple [Representatives of the People]; note that the numbers do not indicate ranking among them given the councils of the French government the much-needed view of the common people, something that they lacked before, and which many consider responsible for the increased stability of the country since then. To outsiders it might seem that the États Généraux now form a French Parliament, though this is not strictly true. Although there have been problems with corruption and nepotism in the États Généraux [much as in any other large political body!], which have forced various changed to its organisation and its electoral system, in general it works well and provides a useful counterbalance to the powers of the state and the nobility. As part of its efforts since the Societal Wars, the États Généraux has secured the people of France the rights to privacy, to strike and some degree of free speech. It has also been able to greatly reduce the level of secrecy in the French government by ensuring that details and transcripts of much of the business of the French government are published in Le Bulletin Royale [The Royal Bulletin; a publication roughly equivalent to the British Hansard of the real world]. It has also been able to achieve a prohibition on torture. Other Councils. There are persistent rumours of the existence of one or more Conseil Invisible [Invisible Councils] or Cabinet Noir [Black Cabinet], which deal with the highest secrets of the French Empire. However, as far as it is known these do not in fact exist. The Grand Office de la Couronne The Grand Office de la Couronne [Great Officers of the Crown] make up the most important Officers of State within the Royal Court and government of France. They are nominally appointed by the King of France, though in general this is not done without the advice of the Conseil du Roi. With the exception of the Chancelier de France and the Premier and Deuxième Représentant du Peuple, these appointments are for life and are not transmissible or hereditary in any way. The Great Officers serve on one or more of the councils making up the overall Conseil du Roi and provide advice and information to the King as required to shape the policy of the French government. The chief minsters of France, that is, generally, the more powerful of the Secrétaire d'État (precisely which of them this is can vary with time and the people in the different positions) are considered to have power second only to the King, and in times where the King is weak or incapacitated effectively run the French government. The Grand Office de la Couronne, and a selection of their subordinates, are listed below: Secrétaire d'État aux Affaires Étrangères [Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]; this is, as the name implies, a post responsible for the foreign affairs of France, including international negotiations and so on. As such they are the head of the Ministère des Affaires Étrangères [Foreign Ministry]. The current holder of the position is Bernard Duvauchelle. In addition to their other roles, the Secrétaire d'État aux Affaires Étrangères is responsible for overseeing the non-military French intelligence services, and also for liaison with the CPMM. Because of rearrangements of the French government over time, this position has come to partly subsume that of Secrétaire d'État à la Guerre [Secretary of State for War], along with the Secrétaire d'État de la Marine and Secrétaire d'État de l'Armée. New French colonies and ones where a great deal of unrest is taking place are usually ruled by a military governor appointed by the Secrétaire d'État aux Affaires Étrangères. Most of the Indian states are more trusted than this, but not to the level of becoming part of France-Outre-Mer. As such they are ruled by France under a system of suzerainty. That is, they are tributary states of France, which controls their foreign affairs while allowing them a degree of domestic autonomy that varies from state to state. French interests are represented in each state via a Résident who lives there, with their staff. Résidents are normally diplomats or military officers and effectively run the state via indirect rule through the native government. Under each Résident there are normally a number of Commissaire [Commissioners] who are responsible for different aspects of French interests in the state. Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur [Secretary of State for the Interior]; one of the Secretaries of State created when the Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi was stripped of much of their powers in 1894, the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur is, as the name implies, a post responsible for matters internal to the French Empire, which are overseen via the Ministère de l'Intérieur [Interior Ministry]. This includes those of France's colonies and other overseas possessions that are considered to be more developed and peaceful, which are ruled by French nobles as parts of France under the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur. These form what is known as France-Outre-Mer [Overseas France]; examples of these are Hispaniola and Algeria. The current holder of the position is Élodie Valadon. As part of their role, the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur is responsible for the French transportation systems, the policing of the French Empire via the Maréchaussée and also for internal security. As such the Lieutenant Général de Police reports to them. The Maréchaussée [the Marshalcy; the French Police]. Law enforcement within the French Empire is the responsibility of the Maréchaussée [see also here, here and here], headed by the Lieutenant Général de Police [Lieutenant General of Police], who is the head of policing for all of the French Empire under the political control of the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur. This post is currently held by Gustave Lenormand. Since 1720 the Maréchaussée was officially attached to the Household of the King (the Maison du Roi). By the time of the Societal Wars, the activities of the Maréchaussée, and in particular the undercover Mouchards [secret police and spies], made France was a very highly surveilled nation, with spies everywhere, to the point that perhaps one in four French people were paid to spy on everyone around them [much as in the real world at one point]. This level of surveillance, and the expense of maintaining it, was one of the drivers of the Societal Wars in France. Most of the records of the Maréchaussée were destroyed during the Societal Wars, and since then the nation has been much less spied upon, with legal rights of privacy and so on, and much more review of what spying and intelligence gathering does go on. As part of this, since the Second Societal Wars the Maréchaussée was moved to be under the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur. Since then the Maréchaussée has evolved into a true police force rather than the tool of state surveillance and oppression it was before. Though the transition was not without its difficulties it handles all aspects of civilian law enforcement, and is far more open and accountable than it was, with only a very limited level of covert activities permitted. It is divided into two main branches: The first of these consists of the Compagnies de Marechaussée [Marshalcy Companies], groups of Marshals assigned to a given area and dispersed through it in small detachments operating out of Station de Marechaussée [Marshalcy Stations; basically police stations]. These handle reports of crime and deal with its investigation and the apprehension of suspects. The Compagnies de Marechaussée are run by Commissaires de Police, officials holding both local administrative and judicial authority in the district for which the company is responsible. Under these are Inspecteurs de Police, investigators responsible for collecting and collating information from each of the districts. They supervise the Exempts de Police, officials responsible for maintaining order who in turn are supported by Sentinelles [foot soldiers] dispersed throughout the district and who perform the everyday policing of France. All Compagnies de Marechaussée also have a small number of Mouchards, irregular spies or secret police, who covertly obtain information on the activities of suspect citizens. However, in the present day the numbers and activities of these are very tightly regulated by law. Separate to this are a number of specialist units. Most of these provide security for specific people or places, such as the Royal Family and royal and strategic sites such as palaces and the mint. Others provide forensic and other specialised support services to the Marechaussée as a whole. All members of the Maréchaussée are armed, with the standard sidearm being the Saint Etienne P1999C automatic pistol produced by the government-owned Manufacture d'armes de Saint-Étienne. In its early days, the uniform of members of the Maréchaussée Sentinelles varied from place to place, although it would be consistent within a local area. With the development of the French economy and government in the nineteenth century the uniform of the Sentinelles across France was standardised to the same uniform, a Royal Blue coat and breeches, with black knee bots and a silver military-style helmet. The uniform was changed in the aftermath of the Societal Wars to indicate the reforms of the Maréchaussée and to distance it from its pre-Wars incarnation. Since then Sentinelles have worn a uniform of scarlet tailcoat and trousers with brown knee boots and gloves. On their heads they wear a golden galea [a helmet in the style of a Roman soldier] with a scarlet crest running front to back. This may appear archaic but is made of modern materials and provides a high level of protection. At their belts they wear a radiant [radio], pistol and baton. In locations where higher security is required, such as Versailles, they may also be equipped with more powerful firearms, such as a submachine gun. A number of the best of the Marechaussée are invited to join the Gardes de la Manche as part of the personal guard of the King. The Garde Ministérielle [Ministerial Guard]. Also under the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur is the Garde Ministérielle, one of the most elite units of the French Military. It was founded during the Societal Wars as a non-Royal equivalent of the Garde du Corps to provide protection to the officers of government and their families and property. This is a duty they retain to this day. There is a certain degree of rivalry between them and the Garde du Corps. Fire officers in France are known as Pompiers [Pumpers]. They originated with the French Navy and, later, the Army and as such are still officially a branch of the Army, being organised, supervised and trained by it. However, in terms of responsibility for and direction of their actions they fall under the control of the Ministère de l'Intérieur. As in the real world, the Pompiers make use of a number of types of fire engines in the course of their work. These are all painted a highly visible bright orange colour, with yellow trim. Chancelier de France [Lord Chancellor of France]; the chief judge of France, responsible for the judiciary of the French Empire, the post is currently held by Maurice Rouget. The Chancelier is responsible for ensuring that laws are implemented and used correctly, and is the final legal arbiter for the Empire as a whole. It is one of the three Grand Office de la Couronne to which is holder is not appointed for life. For practical reasons, the deputy of the Chancelier, the Garde des Sceaux de France [Keeper of the Seals of France], also shoulders a great deal of responsibility for the French legal system. Le Pouvoir Judiciaire [The Judiciary]The last act of Joseph François Dupleix in 1773 was the reform and simplification of the French legal system [something attempted unsuccessfully in the real world in 1771]. Although there have been problems with it since then, and in particular a number of instances in its early days when those who opposed the changes attempted to reverse them, the system has remained in place and evolved into its modern form. This consists of a network of courts across the French Empire, from those at a local level up though more senior regional courts to the highest court in the land under the Chancelier de France. The judges who sit in them are appointed by the King, but cannot be removed by him to avoid political pressure, and are paid by the state to make them less susceptible to bribery. In general all cases are tried by one or more judges, with lawyers presenting the prosecution and defence cases; there is no system of trial by jury in France [not unlike the real world]. There are four groups of courts within the French Empire, each of which has its own judges and facilities, though there is overlap and crossover between them: The Tournelle; this is by far the largest group of courts, and is the one that tries cases in which the accused are commoners. The Cour des Aides [Court of Aids]; the second largest group of courts, and the one that deals with financial disputes of all kinds. The Cour d'Honneur [Court of Honour]; a much smaller set of courts, which tries cases involving the nobility. Because of the small number of crimes tried within the Cour d'Honneur their judges normally work in other courts most of the time, and their courtrooms are likewise shared with other court groups. L'Officialité [the Officialdom]; the smallest group of courts, which tries cases involving the clergy. As for the Cour d'Honneur, L'Officialité shares judges and court facilities with the other court groups. The procedures and punishments used vary between the four groups of courts. For example, in the rare capital cases, members of the nobility are beheaded rather than hung as commoners are, though in both cases where possible the bodies are disassembled after death to allow the organs to be transplanted into those who require them. Contrôleur Général des Finances [Controller-General of Finances]; a position currently held by Noemie Arthus-Bertrand, it is responsible for the finances of France and the French Empire. As such the Contrôleur Général des Finances has a very broad remit and is involved with all of the sub-councils that make up the Conseil du Roi. La Banque Royale [the Royal Bank] The central bank of the French Empire, founded in 1716, and one of the major responsibilities of the Contrôleur Général des Finances. La Banque Royale produces and issues the French currency via the French Mint, regulates the money supply of the Empire, controls French interest rates and regulates the overall banking system of the French Empire. The Mint also produces currency for those states within the French Empire which retain their own monetary systems, such as many of the Indian states. Secrétaire d'État pour les Sciences [Secretary of State for the Sciences]; the other of the Secretaries of State created when the position of Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi was stripped of much of its powers in 1894, the Secrétaire d'État pour les Sciences is, as the name implies, a post responsible for science and technology within the French Empire. The current holder of the position is Professor Hippolyte Idrac. As part of their role, the Secrétaire d'État pour les Sciences is responsible for the French education system and also for its electronic communications systems of all kinds. It is also responsible for scientific links with the CPMM. Conseil de Telecommunications Français [French Telecommunications Council; the CTF]; the organisation responsible for overseeing the French communications network, and in particular the telephone, radiant and television systems under the control of the Secrétaire d'État pour les Sciences. Secrétaire d'État de la Marine [Secretary of State of the Navy]; the political head of the Navy, who oversees the Amiral de France, the Secrétaire d'État de la Marine oversees the strategic direction of the Navy, as well as its funding and general position within the French political arena. The current holder of the position is Gerard de Tassigny. Amiral de France [Admiral of France]; the head of the French Navy under the political control of the Secrétaire d'État de la Marine. The position is currently held by Beatrice d'Évreux. The Amiral de France is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the French navy and merchant fleet. As such the Amiral is also responsible for all naval aviation, and for the naval intelligence service. The French Navy is divided into a number of regional commands based in a given region of the French Empire. These include both defensive forces and offensive forces intended for use in that area, but which can be reassigned to other areas if required. The largest command (and the largest fleet) is the Atlantic, based in France itself, as well as a number of bases in Spain. The Mediterranean and West African commands that are located nearby are smaller and depend on the Atlantic Fleet for much of their strength. The second largest command is the Indian Fleet, based at a number of locations in the sub-continent. It adjoins and supports the smaller Gulf and Far Eastern Fleets; the latter of these provides protection for the Suez Canal in association with the navy of the OSU. Three smaller fleets, the Caribbean, South African and Australian protect these more isolated regions of the French Empire. Secrétaire d'État de l'Armée [Secretary of State of the Army]; similarly to the Secrétaire d'État de la Marine, the Secrétaire d'État de l'Armée is the political head of the Army, oversees the Maréchal Général de France, and is responsible for the strategic direction, funding and general position of the Army. The current holder of the position is Yves Sertillanges. Maréchal Général de France [Marshal General of France]; the head of the French army under the political control of Secrétaire d'État de l'Armée. The position is currently held by Trehouard de Rethel. Similarly to the Amiral de France, the Maréchal Général is responsible for the upkeep and operations of the armies of France. This includes the operation or oversight of many of the armaments suppliers who provide their equipment. In addition the Maréchal Général is responsible for all army aviation and intelligence gathering. The French Army is distributed in a similar way to the Navy. The main difference is that its bases are distributed across the whole of the Empire rather than just along its coastlines. The French army includes a number of units descended from ones made up of foreign troops serving the French crown. These include the Brigade Irlandaise [Irish Brigade] (along with other Irish-descended units), the Gardes Suisses [Swiss Guard] and the Royal Suédois [Royal Swedes]. Although nominally of the nationalities implied by their names, by the present day most of these units consist entirely of French subjects, although normally ones whose ancestry includes the appropriate nationality. Secrétaire d'État à la Santé [Secretary of State for Health]; the newest of the Secretaries of State who form part of the French government, the post of Secrétaire d'État à la Santé was created, as the name implies, to oversee the health of the French nation and all of its people, and in particular to ensure the safety of the nation against the threat of biological warfare. As such it was split off from the Secrétaire d'État pour les Sciences [Secretary of State for the Sciences] in 1938, when it became clear that it was a role demanding the full-time attention of the person filling it. The current Secrétaire d'État à la Santé is Doctor Pierre-Marie Verlaine. The Secrétaire d'État à la Santé is the head of the Ministère de la Santé [Ministry of Health]. As such they are responsible for public health and welfare within the French Empire, and sets the standards expected of those bodies that provide it, including those that support the unemployed and disabled. However, the actual provision of this care is not directly through the French government, but instead is done through other organisations, in particular the Catholic Church and a number of trusts funded by philanthropists and/or public subscriptions of various kinds, though there are also a number of privately funded hospitals for those who can afford them. As such the exact means by which the different forms of care are provided varies a great deal across the Empire, though all are obliged to meet the standards set by the government. A number of these hospitals have been working under versions of these arrangements for centuries. As with hospitals, emergency medical services, including ambulances, are not provided by government, but are subject to standards imposed by the government. They are white, to indicate their medical status, and normally have some form of lights and/or siren to alert others to their coming [all for much the same reasons as in the real world]. Many of them are funded by voluntary donations and legacies, that pay for equipment and training, but in most of them the actual ambulance crews are unpaid volunteers, some drivers, some paramedics, and some medical doctors [this is not unlike the functioning of the British RNLI in the real world]. Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi [Secretary of State of the Household of the King]; originally responsible, as the name of the post indicates, for the upkeep and maintenance of the buildings and household of the King, and for the military, domestic and religious entourage around the royal family in France, over time the post of Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi came to include many other areas of responsibility within its remit. By the late eighteenth century these included policing, religious affairs, including Protestant affairs, and the administration of Paris and all of the non-border regions of France [as in the real world], and by the time of the Second Societal Wars had expanded further to include policing, governmental scientific research, government-run schools and universities, telephony and public communications generally. All of this made the Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi by far the most powerful and influential of all of the French Secrétaire d'État. Because of the power and influence of the role, the Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi was among the least popular parts of the French government and as such the Département de la Maison du Roi under his control suffered particularly heavy attacks and instances of arson during the Societal Wars. With the ending of the Second Societal Wars the post of Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi was stripped of those of its powers unrelated to the household of the King (that is, most of them) and a number of new Secrétaire d'État posts created. These included the Secrétaire d'État à l'Intérieur [Secretary of State for the Interior] which took over regional administration and policing, and the Secrétaire d'État pour les Sciences [Secretary of State for the Sciences], which took over governmental scientific research, government-run schools and universities, and telephony and public communications generally. As part of this, the post of Grand Maître de France [Chief Steward of France] was merged with that of the Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi. The current holder of the post is Gisèle de Custine. Département de la Maison du Roi [The King's Household]. This department, the responsibility of the Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi, makes up the military, domestic and religious entourage around the French royal family. The military part of this entourage is the Garde du Corps [French Army Lifeguard Brigade], a highly skilled elite group who have fought with distinction in many wars, over and above their duty with the royal family. They provide military protection to the royal family and to royal palaces and so on and are divided into four Companies. The best of the Garde, along with some of the best of the Maréchaussée, form the Gardes de la Manche ['Guards of the Sleeve'], an elite squad formed as the personal guard of the King. The Garde du Corps share the guarding of the Royal Family with a corps of Swiss Guards, mercenaries known as the Cent Suisses [Hundred Swiss] who have served the French royal family for centuries. A second corps of Swiss Guards serve outside the Royal Palaces guarding the entrances and perimeter. Other Swiss guard units form part of the French Army as a whole. The domestic entourage of the King is divided into a number of departments including the Bouche du Roi [Kings Palate] that oversees the meals of the king, the Chambre du Roi [King's Chamber] that oversees the King's rooms and personal escort, the Menus-Plaisirs [Revels] that oversee court entertainments and Cérémonies [Ceremonies] that is responsible for royal public ceremonies of all kinds. La Chapelle du Roi [The King's Chapel] forms the ecclesiastical element of the entourage and is headed by the Grand Aumônier de France [Grand Chaplain of France], most often a bishop. It is responsible for the Mass and other religious ceremonies for the sovereign and the royal family, as well as the king's alms and public charities. Premier Représentant du Peuple [First Delegate]; one of the two representatives from the États Généraux who sit as equals in the Conseil du Roi. They are responsible for ensuring that the King and his councils are at least aware of the views of the common people of France. The current holder of this post is Élisée Trezeguet. Deuxième Représentant du Peuple [Second Delegate]; the second representatives of the États Généraux who sits in the Conseil du Roi; note that the Premier and Deuxième titles do not indicate ranking among the Delegates. The current holder of this post is Maximilien Prévost. Because of the influence of the Physiocrats in the French government, and despite the growth of the influence of the Bipodistes, France was slower in industrialising than other nations, such as the Union. The French absolutist system has led to a somewhat strange division of transportation between the public and private sectors. French trains are nationalised, efficient and eco-friendly. Private transport, on the other hand, tends to be (among the common people at least) either velos [bicycles] or powered by animals as this is what the King and government considers best for people. So in the country there are velos or animal-drawn vehicles bringing people to and from stations where they board efficient and sophisticated electric trains. Likewise there are efficient public transport systems in most French cities. However, machine-powered vehicles are common there for mess-reduction reasons, although velos tend to be widely used as well. Most French roads are quite good, partly because they are used for military purposes. The overall greater Paris region in this world - which includes Versailles - has a population of some six million people [considerably smaller than the real world, where it has some twelve million people]. Even taking this into account it covers a significantly smaller area than the Paris of the real world. This is a side effect of the French laws on land usage, which, given the Physiocratic slant of the French government, are heavily biased towards agriculture and the preserving of the countryside over industry and urbanisation. This has strongly limited urbanisation and the outward growth of cities for a very long time. This in turn has driven the growth of skyscrapers in most French cities, so that all French cities have many more tall buildings than in the real world. Another effect of French government policy has been to spread the growth of cities across France rather than concentrating it in a few places, so that there are more large towns and cities (with skyscrapers) but no very large ones as is the case in many other nations. The same effect is seen across the French Empire. With rising populations and increasing problems from climate change, local and increasingly regional governments within the French Empire have begun to mandate the creation of vertical farms within cities, either purpose-built or via the full or partial conversion of existing structures. This is intended to increase the self-sufficiency of cities and reduce the amount of food transportation required. Because there was no French Revolution, French cuisine gained its world-wide reputation later than in the real world. French cuisine has absorbed many Indian influences, as has French fashion and style. Also because of the lack of a French Revolution in this world, the Bastille still exists within Paris. No longer a prison, since the Societal Wars it has instead been used as a highly secure repository for official documents of all kinds. France still has its Crown Jewels, which are kept very securely in Versailles. They are not generally visible to the public, only being used for state occasions. The French Crown Jewels are not as extensive as they have been in the past; a large fraction of them were sold during the Economic Crisis, and some were stolen during the Societal Wars. The remaining jewels include the French Blue, the Regent Diamond and the Koh-i-Noor. There is a long-term fashion in France for Indian styles in terms of food, architecture and so on, as people working there send or bring ideas home. Related to this, there is a significant Indian-descended minority in France and across its Empire, with 'India-towns' in many cities. Because of the French holdings in the rest of the world there are also significant numbers of Africa-, China- and Japan-towns across the French empire. Because of the dominance of France in much of the world, the structure of many of its governments, particularly those in the more heavily French-influenced parts of the world such as India, show significant French influence in terms of their structure and functions [much as in the real world many former British possessions have governments with structures influenced by that of Britain], though of course the names of the different councils and so on within the government may vary. The Mediterranean Sea is a Franco-Ottoman lake. There are a number of national and local newspapers in France. The most popular of these include: La Gazette de France; the longest-running French newspaper, published since 1631 [and which existed in the real world until 1915]. Le Temps [not the same as the real world newspaper of the same name]. Le Monde [also not the same as the real world newspaper of the same name]. Le Moniteur. Mercure de France; published since 1672 [a newspaper that existed in the real world until 1825]. Le Bulletin Royale; a specialised publication, but one of significance as it publishes the details and transcripts of most of the activities of the French government.\\" How would laws be passed in the French Empire?","completion":"In the French Empire as described in the text, laws would typically be created and passed through the intricate system of interlocking councils that make up the Conseil du Roi, also known as the King's Council. Here's a general outline of how laws might be passed in this version of the French Empire: 1. **Proposal Initiation**: A law could be proposed by the king, by members of the specialized councils, by a government minister, or possibly influenced by findings from the continuous anonymous opinion polls sampling the views of the people across the French Empire. 2. **Conseil du Roi Involvement**: The law would then likely be discussed in multiple sessions of the specialized councils making up the overall Conseil du Roi, most notably: - The **Conseil d'en Haut** (High Council), which deals with the most important matters of state, including legislative initiatives. - The **Conseil des Dépêches** (Council of Messages), responsible for administration and internal affairs, crucial for understanding the impact of the law across the Empire. - The **Conseil Royal des Finances** (Royal Council of Finances), assessing the economic implications and budgetary requirements of the law. - The **Conseil Privé** (Privy Council) or the **Conseil de Conscience** (Council of Conscience) might be involved in discussing the legal and moral implications, especially if the law pertains to justice, ethics, or has a significant societal impact. 3. **Approval by the King**: Once the law has been carefully considered and drafted with the involvement of the appropriate councils and ministers, it would be presented to the king for his approval. Given that the system is described as absolutist, the king's assent would be necessary for the law to be enacted. 4. **États Généraux Consultation**: While not a legislative body per se, the États Généraux, and particularly the commoners' assembly, may be consulted for their opinion on the law, reflecting the views and interests of the general populace. 5. **Promulgation**: After receiving the king's approval, the law would be formally promulgated and disseminated throughout the empire, with the details and transcripts of the process potentially being published in \\"Le Bulletin Royale.\\" This process reflects the absolutist nature of the monarchy, whereby the king has substantial power but acts with the advice of specialized councils. The influence of the people is indirectly reflected through the representatives of the États Généraux and anonymous opinion polling, which may affect the decision-making process at various stages. However, it's important to note that the French Empire in this description is not a democracy, and ultimately, the king has substantial sway over which laws are enacted or rejected."},{"prompt":"What key qualities or behaviors differentiate exceptional leaders from the rest?

To find out what biased exponent would be used to represent the number 22 in this format, we first need to express 22 in binary scientific notation. The number 22 in binary is 10110. To put this into scientific notation, we need to normalize it to have one digit to the left of the binary point: 1.0110. In binary, this equals to 2^4 * 1.0110 because we shifted the binary point four positions to the left. Now, to encode this in floating-point representation, we need to set the exponent in such a way that when we adjust it by the bias, we get the actual exponent. For single-precision IEEE 754, the bias for the exponent field is 127. Hence, we must encode an exponent E such that E - 127 = 4 (since 2^4 is our exponent after normalization). So we solve for E: E = 4 + 127 E = 131 Now we need to represent this number in binary: 131 in binary is 10000011. The last part of your question presents multiple choices, among which we must identify the binary representation of 131 (which corresponds to our unbiased exponent plus the bias of 127).

This represents a value just greater than 1.0 (in binary), but since we don't include the leading 1, the stored mantissa is 0. - The sign bit is 0 for positive numbers.

The way you expressed your thoughts and feelings was very moving.” Natsuki: (rubbing her baby bump, feeling the kicks of her unborn daughter - Sakura) “Yeah, yeah, it wasn’t bad, I guess. But it was a bit too cheesy for my taste.” Sayori: “Oh, um…I’m sorry if it wasn’t your cup of tea, Natsuki. I just write what comes from the heart.” Natsuki: “Yeah, I get that. It’s just not really my thing. But I’m sure there are people who appreciate that kind of sappy stuff-” (clutching her belly tightly) “AAH!!!” Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay? What’s wrong?” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “I-I don’t know…I…I think there’s something wrong with Sakura.” Sayori: “Oh my goodness, Natsuki! Are you in pain? Should we call an ambulance?” Yuri: “Take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’ll figure out what’s going on. Is there anything we can do to help?” Monika: “Let’s not panic, but we should definitely get Natsuki some medical attention. Sayori, can you call the school nurse or the principal?” (Sayori nods and quickly reaches for her phone, dialing the school nurse’s number as Yuri assists Natsuki to sit down and tries to calm her down.) Natsuki: “It hurts…it really hurts…” (Sayori gets through to the school nurse and explains the situation. The nurse immediately informs them that she will be on her way to the literature clubroom. Meanwhile, Yuri continues to comfort Natsuki as best as she can.) Yuri: “Just try to take slow and steady breaths, Natsuki. The nurse is on her way. Everything will be okay.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I’m scared, Yuri. What if something’s really wrong?” Monika: “Just stay calm, Natsuki. We’re here for you, and help is on the way. Try to focus on your breathing and think positive thoughts.” Sayori: (ends her call with the nurse) “She’s on her way, guys. Just hold on, Natsuki. You’re going to be okay.” (Natsuki continues to endure the pain while the rest of the club keeps a watchful eye on her. After a tense few minutes, the school nurse bursts into the clubroom.) School Nurse: “What seems to be the problem?” Yuri: “Natsuki is experiencing intense pain in her abdomen, and she’s pregnant. We’re worried something might be wrong with the baby.” School Nurse: “Alright, let’s assess the situation. Natsuki, can you describe the pain to me? Is it constant or does it come in waves?” Natsuki: (wincing) “It’s…it’s like cramps, but sharper…and it comes and goes.” School Nurse: “Okay. I need to check your vital signs and conduct a physical examination. Is that alright?” Natsuki: (nodding) “Please…just make sure Sakura is okay.” (The school nurse proceeds to examine Natsuki, checking her blood pressure, heart rate, and carefully palpating her abdomen. After a thorough assessment, she provides her initial diagnosis.) School Nurse: “Natsuki, from what I can tell, your baby seems to be moving normally, and your vital signs are stable. However, I would still like to take you to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, just to be safe.” Natsuki: (relieved) “Thank goodness. Just as long as Sakura is okay, I’ll do whatever you suggest. Can someone come with me?” Monika: “Of course, Natsuki. We’ll all go with you to the hospital. Your well-being and your baby’s health are our top priority.” (Sayori holds Natsuki’s hand as they help her stand up. Together, they leave the clubroom, a mix of concern and hope in their hearts.) (On the way to the hospital…) Natsuki: “Guys…they’re getting worse…” Sayori: “Hang in there, Natsuki. We’re almost at the hospital. Just hold on a little longer.” Yuri: “Try to take deep breaths, Natsuki. We’re here with you every step of the way.” Monika: “Once we get to the hospital, the doctors will be able to help you and make sure Sakura is safe. Stay strong.” Natsuki: (clenching her fists) “I’m trying… I just want this pain to go away. Please, please let Sakura be alright.” (Soon, they arrive at the hospital and rush Natsuki into the emergency room. The doctors and nurses quickly assess her situation and take her into a room for further examination.) Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to make sure your baby is safe, Natsuki. Just try to stay calm.” Natsuki: (tearfully) “Please save her… I can’t bear the thought of losing her.” (The doctors work swiftly, performing tests and ultrasounds to determine the cause of Natsuki’s pain. The rest of the literature club waits anxiously outside, supporting each other through this difficult time.) Yuri: “Let’s try to stay positive, everyone. Natsuki and Sakura are strong; they’ll pull through.” Sayori: “I’m praying so hard for Natsuki and Sakura. They deserve a happy outcome.” Monika: “We’ve come together as a club to support Natsuki and Sakura. Let’s keep hoping for the best.” (After what feels like an eternity, the doctor finally comes out to update them.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like you’re starting to have some premature contractions. However, the ultrasound shows that Sakura is still doing well and is not in immediate danger. We will need to monitor you closely and take precautions to prevent further contractions and potential premature birth.” Natsuki: (sighs in relief) “Thank goodness. As long as Sakura is safe, I can handle anything.” Doctor: “Yes, Natsuki. We will do everything possible to ensure the best outcome for both you and your baby. You will need to stay in the hospital for observation and receive medication to stop the contractions. We will keep a close eye on Sakura’s development as well.” Monika: “Natsuki, we’ll be right here with you, supporting you through this. You’re not alone.” Sayori: “And we’ll make sure to bring you all the manga and sweets you need to keep your spirits up!” Yuri: “Indeed. We will be here for you, Natsuki. Lean on us whenever you need.” Natsuki: (smiling weakly) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you all.” (And so, the literature club continues to rally around Natsuki during her hospital stay. They take turns visiting her, bringing her comfort and encouragement, and cheering her on as she bravely faces the challenges that come with a high-risk pregnancy. Together, they form a strong support system, reminding Natsuki that she is loved and that they will be there for her every step of the way. However, Natsuki’s contractions continue, with no sign of stopping.) (Several days later…) Natsuki: (breathing heavily, in the hospital bed) “I can’t believe the contractions won’t stop…it’s so painful…” Yuri: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “I know it’s tough, Natsuki, but you’re doing amazing. Just remember to breathe and stay as calm as you can. We’re all right here with you.” Sayori: (squeezing Natsuki’s other hand) “We believe in you, Natsuki! You’re a strong girl, and you and Sakura will get through this together.” Monika: (placing a gentle hand on Natsuki’s shoulder) “You’re not alone, Natsuki. We’re here to support you no matter what happens. You’ve got this.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone…I don’t know what I would do without you. I’ll keep fighting…for Sakura.” (Suddenly, the doctor rushes into the room.) Doctor: “Natsuki, it looks like the contractions are not subsiding, and Sakura’s heart rate is showing signs of distress. We’ll need to perform an emergency c-section as soon as possible.” Natsuki: (worried) “Is Sakura going to be okay?” Doctor: “We’ll do everything we can to ensure both you and Sakura come out of this healthy. The surgical team is preparing for the operation. You’ll be in good hands.” Monika: “Natsuki, try to stay strong. The doctors and nurses here are highly skilled. We’ll be praying for you and Sakura, t-” Natsuki: (feeling a sudden warmth stream down her legs) “I think my water just broke!” Doctor: “Alright, Natsuki, we’re going to take you to the operating room right away. Let’s get you prepped for the c-” Natsuki: (interrupting the doctor) “Forget the c-section! I can feel the baby coming! I need to push!” Doctor: “Natsuki, the situation is critical. We need to perform the c-section immediately to minimize risks to both you a-” (Just before the doctor could finish, Natsuki lets out a loud scream as she feels an intense pressure and an overwhelming urge to push.)","completion":"Natsuki: “I can’t hold it!

Monika: \\"Just keep pushing, Natsuki! You’re doing great!” Sayori: “You’ve got this, Natsuki! We’re all here cheering you on!” Yuri: “Remember to breathe, Natsuki. You’re almost there!” (With each push, Natsuki’s determination grows, and finally, the sound of a baby’s cry fills the room.) Doctor: “Congratulations, Natsuki! You did it! It’s a healthy baby girl!” (Natsuki, exhausted but filled with joy, smiles as the nurses clean and wrap the baby in a soft blanket. The rest of the literature club gazes in awe at the tiny bundle of joy in Natsuki’s arms.) Sayori: “She’s beautiful, Natsuki! You did an amazing job!” Yuri: “Congratulations, Natsuki. Sakura is absolutely precious.” Monika: “I’m so happy for you, Natsuki. Sakura is a perfect name for her.” Natsuki: (tears streaming down her face) “Thank you, everyone. I couldn’t have done it without your support.” (The literature club shares in Natsuki’s joy, celebrating Sakura’s arrival and the successful birth. They spend hours in the hospital room, taking turns holding and cooing over the newest addition to their club.) (In the weeks to follow, the literature club takes turns visiting Natsuki and Sakura at home, bringing gifts and offering their assistance with any challenges that arise. They become a second family for Natsuki, providing love, support, and guidance as she embraces motherhood and navigates the ups and downs of raising her daughter.) (Natsuki’s journey through pregnancy and childbirth may have been filled with unexpected challenges, but with the unwavering support of her friends, she emerged stronger and with a beautiful baby girl in her arms.

Here's a guide to help you find those socks: 1. **Material**: Look for socks that list silver fibers in their material composition. These can be referred to as silver thread, silver yarn, or silver ions. They may be marketed with terms like \\"antimicrobial\\" or \\"odor-resistant.\\" 2. **Branding**: Some brands specialize in silver-infused products or have specific lines that include silver. Brands like X-Static, SilverSpun, SilverTek, or Pro-Tect socks use silver in their socks. 3. **Purpose**: Consider what you want the socks for, as different styles may suit different activities. Hiking, running, and sports socks might have silver for odor control, while diabetic socks may have silver to help prevent infections. 4. **Quality and Reviews**: Look for customer reviews to get real-world feedback on the effectiveness and comfort of the socks you're considering. 5. **Retailers**: Specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores may carry silver-infused socks. Online marketplaces like Amazon, REI, or direct brand websites are also good places to start your search. Please note that while socks with silver can offer antimicrobial properties, personal preferences on fit, comfort, and style vary, so consider what attributes are important to you.

Discord's terms of service clearly prohibit the use of self-bots or any automated bot that uses a user account token to perform actions. Bots in Discord are meant to be created and run using Bot accounts through the official API. If you'd like to use automation in Discord, the appropriate way to do this is to create and register a bot with its own account through the Discord Developer Portal, and then code the bot using the Bot Token provided by Discord. Using a bot in this way must comply with Discord's API terms of service and bot usage guidelines. Additionally, respecting the rules of any servers you are on, including not spamming users and channels, is necessary to ensure a positive experience for everyone on the platform. If you need help with creating a legitimate bot for Discord or you have any other tech-related questions, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"new discord tos updatea allows it so","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, Discord's Terms of Service and Developer documentation still do not allow self-bots or automating user accounts in any way. According to Discord's policy, all automated interactions on the platform should be done through a properly registered bot account, using the official Discord API, and not by automating a regular user account. However, policies and terms can change. If Discord has since updated their Terms of Service to allow self-bots, you would need to thoroughly review the new terms and guidelines to understand the scope of what is permissible. Even so, creating, distributing, or encouraging the use of such self-bots may still pose risks and could potentially lead to action against those involved. It's important to always ensure that you are complying with the current terms set by any service you use. If you're uncertain about the current state of Discord's terms, you should: 1. Review the latest Terms of Service from Discord's official website. 2. Consult Discord's official Developer documentation for any updates on bot usage. 3. Engage directly with Discord support or their official forums to seek clarification. As a reminder, it is crucial to abide by the rules of the platforms you use to sustain a respectful and responsible online community.

The appellant claims that Banco Filipino lacks the legal capacity to file the petition because the individuals responsible for filing and verifying it failed to present the necessary authority from Banco Filipino's board of directors. The appellant contends that since Banco Filipino did not comply with the requirement of obtaining the board of directors' authorization to file the petition, it should be deemed to have no legal standing in the case. As a result, the appellant believes that the Court of Appeals should have dismissed the petition without further consideration. The resolution of this issue requires an examination of whether Banco Filipino's failure to provide the requisite authorization from its board of directors renders its petition invalid. The court must determine if the lack of authority affects the legal capacity of Banco Filipino to initiate legal proceedings. Ultimately, the court will have to assess whether the absence of proper authorization impacts the validity of the respondent's petition and if it warrants a dismissal.

She was an enigmatic figure who possessed a unique skill - magic. Evelina's abilities were far beyond the ordinary, for she could manipulate the world around her in extraordinary ways. However, her magic, like any other power, had its limits and came with unintended consequences. Evelina, standing at a modest B cup, had a complex about her chest size. In a village where beauty was often measured by physical attributes, she couldn't help but feel inadequate. Her mind became consumed by the notion that having the largest bust in the room was the key to finding acceptance and love. It was this desperation that ultimately led her down a dangerous path. One fateful day, as she strolled through the bustling marketplace, Evelina's eyes fixated on a woman across the street. This woman's chest was a testament to the goddess of fertility herself, an ample bosom drawing the gaze of every passerby. The sight of such grandeur only deepened Evelina's insecurities, sending her swirling emotions into a tumultuous storm. Unable to resist the twisted desire that stirred within her, Evelina summoned her powers. As her hands began to glow with an ethereal light, she channeled her magic, aiming to siphon the woman's bust size and transfer it to her own. With a flick of her wrist and a surge of energy, a subtle, almost imperceptible shift occurred. The woman across the street carried on, oblivious to the magic that had transpired. Meanwhile, Evelina felt a subtle tightening in her chest, barely discernible but undeniable. A sense of satisfaction washed over her momentarily, as if she had claimed a small victory. She hurriedly brushed off her hands and glanced down at her reflection in a nearby shop window. Her eyes widened, for the once-modest B cups had swelled into fullness, now rivaling the woman's she had sought to mimic. Evelina's heart pounded with a mixture of elation and trepidation. This newfound asset, though achieved through dubious means, seemed to momentarily alleviate the insecurities that had plagued her for so long. But deep down, Evelina knew that her actions were ill-advised and morally ambiguous. She grappled with a guilty conscience, battling the allure of her powers' potential, and the understanding that true happiness could not be found in acquiring physical attributes at the expense of others. As the days passed, Evelina wrestled with the consequences of her decision. Each time her gaze fell on another woman with a more ample bosom, the temptation to wield her powers resurfaced, gnawing at her like a parasite. It was a dangerous cycle, a never-ending chase for a sense of self-worth that seemed forever elusive. In the midst of this internal struggle, Evelina's encounters with others became increasingly guarded. She feared that her secret could be unraveled, exposing her for what she truly was - a woman tormented by her insecurities and the lengths to which she would go to maintain an illusion of beauty. Little did Evelina know, her journey had only just begun. Secrets have a way of unraveling, and the consequences of her actions would soon come crashing down upon her, threatening not only her relationships but also the very essence of her own magical existence. With an uncertain future on the horizon, Evelina stood at a crossroads.

Her once modest B cup had blossomed into a more pronounced and alluring form, casting a shadow of doubt upon her previous insecurities. The weight of her new size felt tangible, a reminder of the power she had harnessed, and the consequences she now bore.

Though the allure of her enhanced bosom whispered tales of desirability, a bitter knowledge gnawed at her spirit. She had achieved her desired aesthetic, but at what cost? As she scrutinized her reflection, traces of the woman from the marketplace flitted through her mind. Evelina wondered what had become of her, how her diminished bosom affected her own self-perception, and if she had been plagued by a similar desperation that fueled Evelina's actions.

The man's words dripped with insincerity, his intentions masked by false charm. Empathy welled up within Evelina as she recognized the potential for deception. Though the magic that had gifted her own transformation had been born out of selfishness, she couldn't bear to watch others fall victim to disingenuous intentions. Summoning her powers, Evelina focused her energy on a discreet intervention. In a flicker of enchanted essence, she gravity molded the fabric of reality, subtly altering the proportions within the man's trousers. The transformation went unnoticed by others, but a newfound confidence radiated from the man nonetheless.

The newfound self-assuredness propelled him beyond superficial facades, allowing his genuine qualities to shine through the surface. Unbeknownst to the woman, it was not his physical attributes that had changed, but rather a newfound sense of authenticity and self-assurance.

She responded with interest and curiosity, her own doubt dissipating as the conversation deepened between them. Evelina watched from afar, her guilt slowly being replaced by a glimmer of satisfaction. In her own subtle way, she had facilitated a genuine connection, one that transcended the superficiality of appearances. As Evelina turned away, her heart lightened by this small act of intervention, she realized that her magic held the potential for redemption and positive change.

Government Buyback Program: The government can establish a buyback program where they purchase the taxi licenses from the owners at a predetermined price. This allows the owners to sell their licenses at a fair value and recoup their investment. 2. License Transfer Programs: The government can facilitate the transfer of taxi licenses to other regions or sectors where there is higher demand. This would provide an opportunity for license owners to sell their licenses to interested buyers in those areas. 3. License Lease Compensation: If the price of taxi licenses drops, owners could be compensated through a lease compensation program. The government can provide subsidies or financial assistance to taxi license owners who choose to lease their licenses rather than selling them outright. 4. Transition Assistance Programs: The government can offer transition assistance programs to help license owners adapt to the changing market conditions. This can include financial support, retraining programs, or business advice to enable owners to explore alternative sources of income or new business opportunities. 5. Tax Incentives or Breaks: Another approach could be to provide tax incentives or breaks to taxi license owners to offset their losses. This can help alleviate the financial burden and provide some compensation in the form of reduced tax liabilities.

To find the rate at which the water level is rising, we need to find dh/dt, the derivative of the height with respect to time. Given that the water is flowing at a rate of 3 m^3/min, we have dV/dt = 3 m^3/min. We can differentiate the volume equation with respect to time: dV/dt = (1/3)π * d/dt(r^2h) Using the product rule and chain rule, we can differentiate each term in the expression: dV/dt = (1/3)π * (2rh * dr/dt + r^2 * dh/dt) Since the tank is conical, we know that as the water level rises, the radius of the water surface (r) will also change. However, we do not know the value of dr/dt. Therefore, we need to find a relationship between r and h. Given that the height is 8 m and the radius at the base is 3 m, we can use similar triangles to find r in terms of h: r = (3/8)h Substituting this into the rate equation, we have: 3 = (1/3)π * [(2(3/8)h)(dr/dt) + (9/64)h^2 * (dh/dt)] Simplifying this equation, we can solve for dh/dt: dh/dt = (3π/ (4h^2 - (16/9)h))(dr/dt) Now we have a relationship between the rate at which the water level is rising (dh/dt) and the rate at which the radius is changing (dr/dt).

Let's denote the distance between the top of the ladder and the wall as y and the time as t. We are given that the bottom of the ladder is 4 ft from the wall, so at any time t, the bottom of the ladder will be at x = 4 + t ft. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the distance y and the position x: x² + y² = 18² Differentiating this equation with respect to time t, we get: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0 Substituting x = 4 + t, we have: (4 + t)(dx/dt) + y(dy/dt) = 0 Given that dx/dt = 1 ft/sec, we can substitute the known values: (4 + t) + y(dy/dt) = 0 We need to solve this equation for dy/dt, which represents the velocity of the top of the ladder: y(dy/dt) = - (4 + t) dy/dt = -(4 + t) / y To find the velocity at time t = 2, we need to determine the value of y. At time t = 0, the ladder is perpendicular to the ground, so y = 18 ft. Substituting y = 18 and t = 2, we have: dy/dt = - (4 + 2) / 18 dy/dt = -6 / 18 dy/dt = -1/3 ft/sec Therefore, the velocity of the top of the ladder at time t = 2 is -1/3 ft/sec."},{"prompt":"Wrong","completion":"Apologies for the mistake. Let's correct the solution. We are given that the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft/sec. So, dx/dt = 1 ft/sec. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have x^2 + y^2 = 18^2. Differentiating this equation with respect to time t, we get: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. Substituting x = 4 + t, we have: 2(4 + t)(1) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. Simplifying: 8 + 2t + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. We need to solve this equation for dy/dt, which represents the velocity of the top of the ladder: 2y(dy/dt) = -(8 + 2t). dy/dt = -(8 + 2t) / (2y). To find the velocity at time t = 2, we need to determine the value of y. We can use the Pythagorean theorem: (4 + t)^2 + y^2 = 18^2. (4 + 2)^2 + y^2 = 18^2. 36 + y^2 = 18^2. y^2 = 18^2 - 36. y^2 = 288. y = √288.

My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I am a 2024-year graduate in Automation from Tianjin University. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in Automation, a multidisciplinary field that blends computer science, electrical engineering, and system and control. Over six semesters, I maintained an overall GPA of 92.55, reflecting my dedication to academic excellence and strong potential in my further graduate studies. My passion for automatic control was ignited during the study of \\"Autocontrol Theory A,\\" a core course delving into classical automatic control theory and mainly SISO systems. This course exposed me to the mathematical models, time domain, frequency domain, and complex domain analysis of control systems, and an introduction to nonlinear control. Analyzing a control system using transfer functions fascinated me, offering precise and practical approaches, a departure from complex numerical solutions. This course sparked my enchantment with automatic control, earning an impressive 99/100. Continuing my academic journey, I immersed myself in advanced control-oriented courses like \\"Modern Control Theory,\\" \\"Process Control,\\" and \\"Introduction to Robotics,\\" etc., solidifying my foundation in control theory and robotics. Throughout these core courses, my academic performance remained consistently high. Additionally, I participated several research experiences during my undergraduate period. In the Tianjin Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest, as the team leader, I spearheaded topic selection, literature review, task allocation, and paper writing. Playing a pivotal role in developing the STM32 microcontroller program, I applied knowledge from the computer control technology course to address constraints in sensor performance by using moving average filtering. Our project, focused on detecting coins in blind boxes, not only sharpened my technical skills but also enhanced my communication and leadership abilities, laying a robust foundation for future graduate studies. In the National College Students’ Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program, as a core member, I actively participated in a project called “Research and Development of Sniffing Robots for Hazardous Gas Environments.” To cover all the sites in an area once and return in the shortest time, a multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP), I developed an innovative approach by combining the A* algorithm with genetic algorithm techniques: implementing the A* algorithm to construct a distance matrix and determine optimal paths between various patrol points and employing genetic algorithm to solve the matrix and obtain an optimized patrol plan. Based on previous research, I adopted an adaptive crossover and mutation probability so that the population can automatically change at different stages in the evolution process. Besides, I also utilized the Gazebo simulator within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework to create accurate robot and environment models. To further my understanding of advanced control theory, AI, data-driven systems and their applications on drones, unmanned vehicles and robots, etc. as well as to keep track of the latest research findings and prevalent topics in the field of control theory and its applications, I have read a number of papers related to my graduation thesis. After reading these papers, I became aware that my knowledge related to control theory and its applications is far from sufficient, which may not allow me to produce enough excellent scientific science outputs in automatic control. For example, when reading some papers related to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), there are many contents about optimal control, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), which have not been covered during my undergraduate courses. Additionally, EPFL's global leadership in research, especially in Automation and Control, is evident. The distinguished professors and vibrant academic community make it an institution I am eager to contribute to and benefit from. Therefore, the Master’s program in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in automatic and systems at EPFL aligns seamlessly with my aspirations, offering advanced courses in system identification, nonlinear control, and model predictive control, etc. What’s more, this master’s program at EPFL will provide me the opportunity to combine control theory with industries tightly. It includes a compulsory industrial internship with a minimal duration of 8 weeks, which will be beneficial for my further career. I am excited about the prospect of acquiring advanced knowledge and making preparations for applying for a Ph.D. position in Switzerland or other countries. Ultimately, I aspire to apply my expertise to address real-world challenges, driving innovation and efficiency in industries that rely on systems, control, and robotics. Moreover, as a curious young man, I am pleased to learn French during my further studies because French is precise and widely used worldwide. Also, I love the concept of freedom and equality in French culture and language. So, although some courses, such as “Commande non linéaire,” “Systèmes embarqués microprogrammés” may be taught in French, I regard it as a rare opportunity for me to learn French. I believe learning French at EPFL will help benefit me throughout my life. I am genuinely thrilled about the opportunity to advance my knowledge and skills through advanced control-related courses, formal scientific training, and preparation for a Ph.D. I deeply appreciate your consideration of my application and the time you've dedicated to it.

Include lots of dialogue, especially as they each react to and explore their transformation.","completion":"Chapter 1: The Bewitching Discovery It was a beautiful summer day when five friends, Amelia, Grace, Lily, Sophia, and Olivia, decided to spend their afternoon exploring a thrift store located at the heart of their small town. As they rummaged through the diverse assortment of items, each woman curiously examined trinkets, clothing, and antique treasures. Among the cluttered shelves, Olivia's fingers graced upon a peculiar, shimmering stone. The crystal was unlike anything they had ever seen before; its iridescent hues mesmerized them, beckoning their attention. The women gathered around, their eyes wide with intrigue. \\"Look at this!\\" Olivia exclaimed, holding the magic stone in her hand. \\"It's positively enchanting, isn't it?\\" Her friends marveled at the stone's radiance. \\"We should buy it, just for the sheer beauty of it,\\" Amelia suggested, her encouraging voice resonating through the group. Agreeing in unison, the five women pooled their money together and purchased the mesmerizing stone. Little did they know that this ordinary visit to a thrift store would soon change their lives in extraordinary ways. That evening, the women gathered at Amelia's house, eager to examine their newfound treasure further. Sitting in her cozy living room, they created a circle, placing the stone at the center. \\"Who knows what secrets this stone holds? Perhaps it's capable of granting wishes,\\" Lily pondered, her voice filled with excitement. Curiosity encompassed Sophia, who couldn't help but reach out to the magical stone. \\"Should we give it a try, ladies? Just to test the waters,\\" she suggested, her eyes gleaming with anticipation. The others glanced at each other, contemplating the possibilities. With a nod, they encouraged Sophia to make her wish. Within seconds, her voice resonated through the room, \\"I wish to have the bluest eyes in the world!\\" Suddenly, a mysterious energy surged through the room, enveloping all five women. Their bodies began to glow softly as the magic stone granted Sophia's wish. Expectantly, the women started to examine each other, their eyes widening with astonishment. Sophia's once brown eyes sparkled with a vivid blue hue, but they weren't alone. Amelia, Grace, Lily, and Olivia also shared her transformation. Confusion and disbelief filled the room. \\"What in the world just happened?\\" Olivia exclaimed, her voice trembling with shock. Amelia's gaze was fixed on her own reflection. She noticed something peculiar about her body—a notable increase in her bust size. She gasped, realizing it wasn't just her; all of them had experienced the change. \\"Whose wish was that?!\\" Lily questioned, her voice filled with disbelief. \\"How could you wish for something so…personal?\\" Sophia stammered in confusion, \\"I—I didn't know it would affect all of us! I didn't mean to cause this.\\" Grace, usually composed, burst into laughter. \\"Oh, my! I always said we were inseparable, but I didn't realize it would be taken this literally.\\" The room fell silent as they each examined their transformed bodies and processed their emotions. The mood was a mix of shock, anger, and curiosity. \\"Okay, this is surreal,\\" Amelia finally spoke up, her voice tinged with laughter and disbelief. \\"Let's not panic, ladies. We have a magic stone that can grant wishes. We just need to be careful and remember that our wishes will affect us all.\\" As the realization sank in, the women started sharing their thoughts, their concerns intermingling with bursts of laughter. They explored and embraced the heights and depths of their transformation, each taking turns examining their new features and discussing potential solutions. \\"What if we embraced this as an opportunity to grow closer as friends?\\" Grace proposed, optimism threading through her words. Amelia nodded in agreement. \\"You're right, Grace. We have something extraordinary here. Let's use it wisely and support each other through this experience. Together, we can navigate this magical adventure.\\" And so, with laughter, tears, and newfound strength, the five women set out on a journey of self-discovery and camaraderie, weaving their fates together with the magic stone as their guide. Little did they know, this transformative event would become the catalyst for incredible adventures in friendship, love, and the exploration of their true selves."},{"prompt":"Civil Case No. 9675 – filed on February 2, 1985 by Banco Filipino against the Monetary Board, the Central Bank of the Philippines and Jose Fernandez, Jr., Carlota P.

Sebelum subsidi: Fungsi permintaan: Qd = 25.000 - 5P Fungsi penawaran: Qs = 10.000 + 10P Untuk mencari titik keseimbangan, kita tinggal mencocokkan Qd (jumlah permintaan) dengan Qs (jumlah penawaran). Dalam hal ini, Qd = Qs. 25.000 - 5P = 10.000 + 10P Kita bisa menyederhanakan persamaan tersebut: 5P + 10P = 25.000 - 10.000 15P = 15.000 P = 15.000 / 15 P = 1.000 Jadi, sebelum subsidi, tingkat harga (P) adalah 1.000. Untuk mengetahui jumlah barang (Q) pada titik keseimbangan, kita tinggal menggantikan nilai P ke dalam salah satu fungsi, misalnya menggunakan fungsi penawaran: Qs = 10.000 + 10P Qs = 10.000 + 10(1.000) Qs = 10.000 + 10.000 Qs = 20.000 Jadi, sebelum subsidi, jumlah barang (Q) pada titik keseimbangan adalah 20.000 unit. Setelah subsidi, subsidi (s) ditetapkan sebesar 300. Ini akan menggeser fungsi penawaran menjadi: Qs = 10.000 + 10(P+s) Qs = 10.000 + 10(1.000+300) Qs = 10.000 + 10(1.300) Qs = 10.000 + 13.000 Qs = 23.000 Jadi, setelah subsidi, jumlah barang (Q) pada titik keseimbangan adalah 23.000 unit.

Sementara itu, ekonomi makro fokus pada analisis keseluruhan perekonomian suatu negara atau wilayah, seperti pertumbuhan ekonomi, inflasi, pengangguran, kebijakan fiskal dan moneter, dan neraca perdagangan. Analisis ekonomi makro berusaha memahami faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi keseimbangan agregat (total) dalam perekonomian dan dampaknya pada tingkat harga umum, output, dan lapangan kerja. 2. Ekonomi mikro melibatkan analisis unit-unit ekonomi individu dan interaksi mereka dalam pasar yang spesifik, seperti harga dan kuantitas barang atau jasa tertentu. Fokusnya adalah pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan seperti bagaimana konsumen membuat keputusan pembelian, bagaimana produsen mengatur produksi, atau bagaimana harga ditentukan di pasar individu. Di sisi lain, ekonomi makro melibatkan analisis keseluruhan perekonomian dan interaksi antara berbagai sektor ekonomi, seperti konsumsi agregat, investasi, eksport-impor, perubahan dalam tingkat pengangguran, atau dampak kebijakan makroekonomi terhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi. Fokusnya adalah pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan seperti mengapa inflasi meningkat, apakah pertumbuhan ekonomi stabil, atau bagaimana kebijakan moneter mempengaruhi perekonomian secara keseluruhan. Dengan demikian, perbedaan utama antara ekonomi mikro dan makro terletak pada ruang lingkup analisis mereka, dengan ekonomi mikro lebih fokus pada tingkah laku individu atau unit-unit kecil, sementara ekonomi makro lebih menitikberatkan pada keseimbangan agregat dan faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi perekonomian secara keseluruhan."},{"prompt":"tujuan dari prinsip ekonomi","completion":"Tujuan dari prinsip ekonomi adalah memberikan kerangka kerja atau pedoman bagi individu, perusahaan, dan pemerintah dalam mengambil keputusan ekonomi yang efisien dan efektif.

Prinsip-prinsip seperti keuntungan maksimal dan biaya minimum membantu dalam pengambilan keputusan yang bijaksana tentang penggunaan sumber daya untuk menghasilkan barang dan jasa. 2. Mencapai efisiensi perekonomian: Prinsip ekonomi membantu mencapai efisiensi dalam perekonomian dengan mendorong kombinasi produksi yang paling efektif dan alokasi sumber daya yang optimal. Hal ini meningkatkan produktivitas dan pertumbuhan ekonomi. 3. Meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakat: Tujuan prinsip ekonomi adalah mencapai kesejahteraan masyarakat secara keseluruhan. Dengan memastikan penggunaan sumber daya yang efisien, prinsip ekonomi mencoba untuk meningkatkan pendapatan dan taraf hidup masyarakat. 4. Stabilitas ekonomi: Prinsip ekonomi juga membantu mencapai stabilitas dalam perekonomian, seperti stabilitas harga dan tingkat pengangguran yang rendah. Prinsip ekonomi memberikan panduan tentang bagaimana kebijakan fiskal dan moneternya harus dirancang untuk mencapai tujuan ini. 5. Mengatur tingkat pendapatan dan distribusi yang adil: Prinsip ekonomi juga berusaha untuk mencapai distribusi pendapatan yang adil di masyarakat.

Harga barang atau jasa: Hubungan antara harga barang atau jasa dengan permintaan biasanya bersifat terbalik. Artinya, ketika harga naik, permintaan cenderung menurun, dan sebaliknya. 2. Pendapatan konsumen: Permintaan cenderung meningkat ketika pendapatan konsumen naik. Barang normal adalah barang yang permintaannya naik seiring dengan kenaikan pendapatan, sedangkan barang inferior adalah barang yang permintaannya menurun seiring dengan kenaikan pendapatan. 3. Harga barang terkait: Permintaan suatu barang juga dapat dipengaruhi oleh harga barang terkait. Jika harga barang terkait naik, permintaan barang yang lain yang saling tergantung bisa naik. 4. Preferensi konsumen: Selera dan preferensi konsumen juga mempengaruhi tingkat permintaan. Permintaan terhadap barang atau jasa tertentu biasanya meningkat jika ada peningkatan minat konsumen terhadapnya. 5. Faktor demografis: Faktor-faktor seperti pertumbuhan populasi, distribusi umur, dan komposisi demografis dapat mempengaruhi permintaan untuk berbagai barang atau jasa. Faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi penawaran: 1. Harga input atau bahan baku: Naiknya harga input atau bahan baku yang digunakan dalam produksi dapat berdampak pada penurunan penawaran barang atau jasa, karena produsen harus mengeluarkan biaya yang lebih tinggi. 2. Teknologi: Kemajuan teknologi dapat meningkatkan efisiensi produksi dan mengurangi biaya, sehingga dapat meningkatkan penawaran barang atau jasa. 3. Faktor produksi yang tersedia: Jumlah dan ketersediaan faktor produksi seperti tenaga kerja, modal, dan sumber daya alam dapat mempengaruhi tingkat penawaran. 4. Kondisi pasar: Kondisi pasar, termasuk persaingan antara produsen, regulasi pemerintah, dan kebijakan ekonomi, dapat mempengaruhi penawaran barang atau jasa. 5. Harapan produsen: Harapan mengenai masa depan juga dapat mempengaruhi penawaran. Jika produsen percaya bahwa permintaan akan meningkat di masa depan, mereka dapat meningkatkan penawaran saat ini.
