Now, let's check if the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned. A matrix is considered ill-conditioned if its condition number is large. The condition number can be calculated as the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. However, calculating the condition number can be computationally expensive, and a simpler way to check if a matrix is ill-conditioned is to compare the determinant with the product of the diagonal elements. In this case, the determinant is 2, and the product of the diagonal elements is 1 * 4 * 13 = 52. Since the determinant is much smaller than the product of the diagonal elements, the matrix might be ill-conditioned. An ill-conditioned matrix means that the system of linear equations is sensitive to small changes in the coefficients or the constants. In other words, a small change in the input values can lead to a large change in the solution. This can cause numerical instability and inaccurate results when solving the system using numerical methods.

At t=0, I(0) = 0 (assuming no one is infected initially): ln(0.1) = 0.1 * 0 + C C = ln(0.1) Now we can write the general solution: ln(I'(t) + 0.1) = 0.1t + ln(0.1) I'(t) + 0.1 = 0.1 * e^(0.1t) I'(t) = 0.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1 Now, we can find the number of infected people after 10 days: I'(10) = 0.1 * e^(0.1 * 10) - 0.1 I'(10) = 0.1 * e - 0.1 ≈ 0.1718 However, this is the rate of change of the number of infected people at t=10. To find the total number of infected people after 10 days, we need to integrate I'(t) from 0 to 10: I(10) = ∫(0.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1) dt from 0 to 10 I(10) = [e^(0.1t) - 0.1t] from 0 to 10 I(10) = (e - 0.1 * 10) - (1 - 0) = e - 1 ≈ 1.718 However, this result seems incorrect, as it is not consistent with the initial infection rate of 50 people per day. The issue is that we assumed no one was infected initially, which is not true. Let's reconsider the problem with the correct initial condition: At t=0, I(0) = 50: ln(50 + 0.1) = 0.1 * 0 + C C = ln(50.1) Now we can write the general solution: ln(I'(t) + 0.1) = 0.1t + ln(50.1) I'(t) + 0.1 = 50.1 * e^(0.1t) I'(t) = 50.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1 Now, we can find the number of infected people after 10 days: I(10) = ∫(50.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1) dt from 0 to 10 I(10) = [500.1 * e^(0.1t) - 0.1t] from 0 to 10 I(10) = (500.1 * e - 0.1 * 10) - (500.1 * 1 - 0) ≈ 500.1 * (e - 1) ≈ 818.7 So, after 10 days, there will be approximately 818.7 infected people in the town."},{"prompt":"Consider a population of 100,000 individuals in a town.

Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations: d²X(x)/dx² = -λ²X(x) and dT(t)/dt = -αλ²T(t) Solving the first equation, we get the general solution: X(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx) Applying the boundary conditions, X(0) = X(30) = 0, we get: B = 0 and λ = nπ/30, where n is an integer. So, X(x) = A sin(nπx/30). Now, solving the second equation, we get the general solution: T(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t) Combining the solutions for X(x) and T(t), we get: T(x, t) = ∑(A_n sin(nπx/30) e^(-α(nπ/30)²t)) To find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 80°C: 80 = ∑(A_n sin(nπx/30)) We can find A_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions: A_n = (2/30) ∫(80 sin(nπx/30) dx) from 0 to 30 A_n = (160/πn)(1 - (-1)^n) Now, we have the temperature distribution: T(x, t) = (160/π) ∑[((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπx/30) e^(-α(nπ/30)²t)] Finally, we can find the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from one end of the rod after 10 minutes of cooling: x = 5 cm, t = 10 * 60 s T(5, 600) = (160/π) ∑[((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπ(5/30)) e^(-α(nπ/30)²(600))] α = 4.89 x 10^-6 m^2/s, so we have: T(5, 600) ≈ (160/π) ∑[((1 - (-1)^n)/n) sin(nπ/6) e^(-4.89 x 10^-6 (nπ/30)²(600))] Summing the series up to n = 100 terms should give a good approximation: T(5, 600) ≈ 37.4°C So, the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from one end of the rod after 10 minutes of cooling is approximately 37.4°C."},{"prompt":"Sure, here's a question for the math student to solve: A metal bar with a length of 10 cm and cross-sectional area of 2 cm2 is heated such that its initial temperature is 20°C.

In this case, the Laplacian operator in cylindrical coordinates is given by: ∇²T = (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂T/∂r) The boundary and initial conditions for this problem are: 1. T(r, 0) = 20°C (initial temperature) 2. T(0.5 cm, t) = 100°C (temperature at the surface of the rod) 3. T(0, t) is finite (temperature at the center of the rod) To solve the heat diffusion equation with these boundary and initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written as the product of two functions, one depending only on r and the other only on t: T(r, t) = R(r) * Θ(t) Substituting this into the heat diffusion equation and dividing by T(r, t), we get: (1/Θ) ∂Θ/∂t = (1/(r * R)) ∂/∂r (r ∂R/∂r) Since the left side of the equation depends only on t and the right side depends only on r, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call -λ². Now we have two ordinary differential equations: 1. ∂Θ/∂t = -λ² * α * Θ 2. ∂/∂r (r ∂R/∂r) = -λ² * r * R The general solution to the first equation is: Θ(t) = A * exp(-λ² * α * t) where A is a constant. The second equation is a Bessel's equation of order 0. The general solution is: R(r) = B * J₀(λ * r) + C * Y₀(λ * r) where B and C are constants, and J₀ and Y₀ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order 0, respectively. Now we apply the boundary and initial conditions: 1. T(r, 0) = R(r) * Θ(0) = 20°C 2. T(0.5 cm, t) = R(0.5 cm) * Θ(t) = 100°C 3. T(0, t) = R(0) * Θ(t) is finite From the third condition, we know that C = 0 since Y₀(0) is not finite. So, the solution becomes: T(r, t) = R(r) * Θ(t) = (B * J₀(λ * r)) * (A * exp(-λ² * α * t)) Applying the second condition, we get: 100°C = B * J₀(λ * 0.5 cm) * A * exp(-λ² * α * t) Since this equation must hold for all times t, we can conclude that: B * J₀(λ * 0.5 cm) = 100°C Now, we need to find the eigenvalues λ and the corresponding coefficients B. This can be done using the method of Fourier-Bessel series. The eigenvalues λ are the roots of the Bessel function J₀(λ * 0.5 cm) = 0. The coefficients B can be found using the orthogonality property of Bessel functions. Finally, the temperature distribution T(r, t) can be written as a sum of the product of Bessel functions and exponential functions: T(r, t) = 20°C + Σ [B_n * J₀(λ_n * r) * exp(-λ_n² * α * t)] where the sum is taken over all eigenvalues λ_n and their corresponding coefficients B_n. In practice, the series converges quickly, and only a few terms are needed to obtain a good approximation of the temperature distribution. To find the exact values of λ_n and B_n, one can use numerical methods or consult tables of Bessel function zeros."},{"prompt":"A metal rod of length 1 meter has an initial temperature of 100°C.

The maximum displacement of a point on the string from its equilibrium position is represented by the amplitude A. However, we don't have enough information to determine the amplitude of the wave. So, the equation of the wave function representing this wave is: y(x, t) = A * sin(8.3776x - 2764.6015t) The wavelength of the wave is 0.75 meters, and we cannot determine the maximum displacement (amplitude) without more information."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:I},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"search-container"},_={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},B=["disabled"],X={key:0},F={key:1};function W(n,e,h,f,a,s){const m=w("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",L,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>a.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,a.searchQuery]]),a.searchQuery?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>a.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",_,[(i(!0),o(v,null,x(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(i(),b(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),o("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(a.searchQuery)+'".
