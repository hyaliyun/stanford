For simplicity, let’s place the start of the first segment at the origin, meaning both its endpoints have integer coordinates. 3. **Analysis of segment intersections**: - Consider the second segment. This second segment must intersect the first segment, but cannot entirely contain nor be entirely contained within the first segment. Otherwise, the intersection would have an even length (since containing or being contained would mean endpoints will share parity). - Consequently, one of the endpoints of the second segment must have an integer coordinate. Since the second segment itself is of even length, the other endpoint must also be an integer. 4. **Generalizing the segment properties**: - By similar logic, the third segment must also intersect both the first and the second segments without entirely containing or being contained within either. - Thus, both endpoints of the third segment must similarly have integer coordinates owing to it being of even length. 5. **Analyzing coordinates**: - Given the condition about intersections being segments of odd length, we need to investigate the coordinate parities. - The endpoints of any two segments will have identical parity since all segments are of even length (either both even or both odd). - When segments have endpoints of identical parity, their intersection would necessarily subdivide into segments possessing equivalent endpoint parity, thus creating a segment of even length. 6. **Contradiction**: - We observe a contradiction here because, according to the problem's requirements, the intersections must result in segments having odd lengths, which is impossible if all individual segment endpoints have identical parity leading to even intersection lengths.

Also, it notably distinguishes its range from sin y and cos y when y approaches 45^circ and beyond since tan y starts to exceed both as y increases. Looking at trigonometric properties: - As y increases from 0^circ to 90^circ, sin y increases from 0 to 1. - cos y decreases from 1 to 0. - tan y increases from 0 to infty. The unique situation occurs when tan y is significantly larger than both sin y and cos y, which typically happens as y increases past 45^circ towards 90^circ.

Let's analyze the problem step by step: - The total number of matches is 2014. - The player who takes the last match wins. - Each player can take between 1 and 7 matches per turn. 2.

We can substitute the value of J from the first relationship into the third equation: 0.85A + A + F = 983 Combining the A terms, we get: 1.85A + F = 983 Now, we can substitute the value of A from the second relationship into the above equation: 1.85(F + 7) + F = 983 Expanding the equation, we get: 1.85F + 12.95 + F = 983 Combining the F terms, we get: 2.85F + 12.95 = 983 Subtracting 12.95 from both sides, we get: 2.85F = 983 - 12.95 2.85F = 970.05 Now, we can solve for F: F = 970.05 / 2.85 F = 340.3684210526316 Since the number of cars counted must be a whole number, we can round F to the nearest whole number, which is 340. Now we can find the number of cars Ann counted: A = F + 7 A = 340 + 7 A = 347 Finally, we can find the number of cars Jared counted: J = 0.85A J = 0.85 * 347 J = 294.95 Again, since the number of cars counted must be a whole number, we can round J to the nearest whole number, which is 295.

To find the speed of the train, we need to convert the time to hours since speed is typically measured in meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h). 1 minute = 60 seconds Now, we can calculate the speed of the train in meters per second (m/s): Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 3600 meters / 60 seconds Speed = 60 meters/second If you want the speed in kilometers per hour (km/h), you can convert it as follows: 1 meter/second = 3.6 kilometers/hour So, the speed in km/h is: Speed = 60 m/s * 3.6 km/h per m/s Speed = 216 km/h Therefore, the speed of the train is boxed{60} meters per second or 216 kilometers per hour."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, given that sin(AB)cos B + cos(AB)sin B geq 1, then triangle ABC is ( ) A: A right triangle B: An acute triangle C: An obtuse triangle D: An equilateral triangle","completion":"The given condition can be simplified using the angle sum identity for sine, which states that sin(A-B)cos B + cos(A-B)sin B = sin(A).

Therefore, proposition 1 is not entirely correct because we need to account for the negative correlation when r is negative, where a larger |r| still indicates a stronger correlation regardless of the sign. For proposition 2, the smaller the residual sum of squares, the closer the data points are to the regression line, which typically indicates a better fitting model. Therefore, proposition 2 is correct. Regarding proposition 3, it is the larger R^2 that indicates a better model fitting, contrary to what the proposition states. The coefficient of determination R^2 represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable in a regression model. A larger R^2 value means a larger proportion of variance is explained, hence, a better fitting effect. Thus, proposition 3 is incorrect.

If there are 1894 apples and tangerines, how many boxes of tangerines are there?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total number of apples. Since there are 19 boxes of apples and each box contains 46 apples, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples per box to find the total number of apples: Total apples = Number of boxes of apples × Number of apples per box Total apples = 19 × 46 Total apples = 874 Now we know there are 874 apples. Since we have a total of 1894 apples and tangerines, we can find the number of tangerines by subtracting the number of apples from the total: Total tangerines = Total apples and tangerines - Total apples Total tangerines = 1894 - 874 Total tangerines = 1020 Now we know there are 1020 tangerines. Since each box of tangerines contains 170 pieces, we can find the number of boxes of tangerines by dividing the total number of tangerines by the number of tangerines per box: Number of boxes of tangerines = Total tangerines ÷ Number of tangerines per box Number of boxes of tangerines = 1020 ÷ 170 Number of boxes of tangerines = 6 Therefore, there are boxed{6} boxes of tangerines."},{"prompt":"Let x and y be nonzero real numbers, a > 0, and a neq 1.

Find the number of days n that the student observed.","completion":"From the problem, we know the following: - Since each day has a morning and an afternoon, the student makes two observations per day. - The total number of observations of clear skies is 7 (mornings) + 5 (afternoons) = 12. - The total number of rainy half-day observations is 8. - If it rained in the afternoon, then it was clear in the morning. This means that rainy afternoons are already included in the count of clear mornings. Now, let's denote the number of days it rained in the afternoon as r. Since each of these r days has a clear morning, we can say that out of the 7 clear mornings, r of them were paired with rainy afternoons. The remaining clear mornings (7 - r) were paired with clear afternoons, and therefore contribute to full days of clear weather. The number of full clear days is 7 - r, and the number of clear afternoons (which are not paired with clear mornings) is 5 - (7 - r) = r - 2. Also, we know that there are 8 half-days of rain, and r of these are already accounted for by the rainy afternoons. This means there were 8 - r mornings with rain. Thus, the total number of days is the sum of full clear days, days with clear afternoons and rainy mornings, and days with rainy afternoons and clear mornings, which can be expressed as: n = (7 - r) + (r - 2) + r Now, let's find the value of r. We know that the total days with clear observations is 12. Therefore, we need to subtract the rainy half-days to find the full clear days: 12 - 8 = 4 full days of clear weather. This is the same as the number of full clear days 7 - r, so we get: 4 = 7 - r Solving for r, we find: r = 7 - 4 = 3. Now we can calculate n: n = (7 - 3) + (3 - 2) + 3 n = 4 + 1 + 3 n = 8.

First, let's calculate the remaining amount after the donations to the community pantry project and the local crisis fund: The community pantry project receives ( frac{1}{3}X ). The local crisis fund receives ( frac{1}{2}X ). The total amount given to these two projects is ( frac{1}{3}X + frac{1}{2}X ). To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case: ( frac{1}{3}X = frac{2}{6}X ) ( frac{1}{2}X = frac{3}{6}X ) So, the total amount given to the two projects is ( frac{2}{6}X + frac{3}{6}X = frac{5}{6}X ). This means the remaining amount is ( X - frac{5}{6}X = frac{1}{6}X ). Now, 1/4 of this remaining amount goes to the livelihood project funds: ( frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{6}X = frac{1}{24}X ) The rest, which is 30, is for the contingency fund: ( frac{1}{6}X - frac{1}{24}X = frac{4}{24}X - frac{1}{24}X = frac{3}{24}X = frac{1}{8}X ) So, ( frac{1}{8}X = 30 ).

The number of twos in even positions will be ( k ) and the number of ones in even positions will be ( l ). To understand when ( A ) is divisible by 11, we need to utilize a property: A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11. Given that, - Sum of the digits in odd positions is ( s_{text{odd}} = k + 2l ) - Sum of the digits in even positions is ( s_{text{even}} = 2k + l ) The difference, ( D ), is: [ D = s_{text{odd}} - s_{text{even}} = (k + 2l) - (2k + l) = l - k = 2013 - 2k ] For ( A ) to be divisible by 11: [ 2013 - 2k equiv 0 pmod{11} ] Since ( 2013 equiv 0 pmod{11} ) (because 2013 is a multiple of 11), we get: [ 2k equiv 0 pmod{11} ] Thus, ( k ) must be a multiple of 11. To find the maximum amount of rubles Vasya can earn, note that Petya can change ( k ) by 1 in each move by swapping a 1 from an odd position with a 2 from an even position or vice versa.

Since he fell into debt, this means his total income for these 8 months was less than his expenditure. So, his total income for 8 months was ( I times 8 ), and it was less than 640. We can write this as: [ I times 8 < 640 ] For the next 6 months, his monthly expenses were reduced to 65, so his total expenditure for these 6 months was ( 65 times 6 ), which equals ( 390 ). During these 6 months, not only did he clear his debt, but he also saved 50. This means his total income for these 6 months was his expenditure plus his debt plus his savings.

The volume of water displaced will be equal to the volume of the spherical ball. First, let's calculate the volume of water displaced when the water level rises by 6.75 cm. The volume of water displaced (V_water) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V_water = π * r^2 * h where r is the radius of the cylindrical tub and h is the height by which the water level rises. Given that the radius of the cylindrical tub (r) is 12 cm and the height by which the water level rises (h) is 6.75 cm, we have: V_water = π * (12 cm)^2 * 6.75 cm V_water = π * 144 cm^2 * 6.75 cm V_water = π * 972 cm^3 V_water = 3053.628 cm^3 (approximately, using π ≈ 3.14159) Now, let's equate the volume of water displaced to the volume of the spherical iron ball (V_ball). The volume of a sphere (V_ball) is given by the formula: V_ball = (4/3) * π * r_ball^3 where r_ball is the radius of the spherical ball. Since V_water = V_ball, we have: 3053.628 cm^3 = (4/3) * π * r_ball^3 To find r_ball, we rearrange the equation: r_ball^3 = (3053.628 cm^3) / ((4/3) * π) r_ball^3 = (3053.628 cm^3) / (4.18879) r_ball^3 = 729 cm^3 (approximately) Now, we take the cube root of both sides to find r_ball: r_ball = ³√729 cm^3 r_ball = 9 cm Therefore, the radius of the spherical iron ball is approximately boxed{9} cm."},{"prompt":"the triangle shown, for angle A to be the largest angle of the triangle, the side lengths are now given as x+11 for BC, x+6 for AC, and 3x+2 for AB.

Let O be the incenter of the triangle, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors and also the center of the incircle (see Figure 1). 1. **Angle Relationships:** By the property of inscribed angles and the angle bisector, we have: [ angle CBF = angle CAF = angle BAF = angle BCF = frac{alpha}{2}. ] Therefore, in the triangle ABFO, the exterior angle angle BOF can be expressed as: [ angle BOF = angle OBA + angle BAO = frac{beta}{2} + frac{alpha}{2} = angle OBF. ] Similarly, we consider the triangle COFO, and we have: [ angle COF = frac{alpha}{2} + frac{gamma}{2} = angle OCF. ] Since angle BOF = angle OBF and angle COF = angle OCF, both triangles BOF and COF are isosceles triangles with: [ BF = OF = CF. ] 2. **Similar Triangles:** In triangles AFC and CFE, we have: [ angle FCE = angle CAF = frac{alpha}{2}, quad text{and} quad angle EFC = angle FCE. ] Thus, triangles AFC and CFE are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity.

This circle will intersect segment AF at the center of the incircle, point O. Given the incenter and one other point on the incircle, the entire incircle can be drawn. * Drawing tangents from A and E to the incircle will give the sides of the triangle. 4. **Feasibility Conditions:** For the construction to be feasible, the point A must be outside the incircle, and point E must not lie inside the incircle. Moreover, we need: [ OE < OA. ] Given OE = C'F - FE and OA = AF - C'F, this condition is equivalent to: [ 2C'F < AF + FE, ] which is always satisfied by the arithmetic and geometric means inequality. 5.

This projection demonstrates that the painted points do not project to a single point more than five times, due to the minimum distance constraint of 0.1 between any two painted points. 3. **Calculating the total length**: - Because no painted point can appear at the same projection more than once within a single 0.1 subinterval due to the given constraint, at most, five 0.1 subintervals can contain more than one painted segment. - Thus, the number of subintervals (of length 0.1) containing any painted segment can be at most 5. 4. **Final bound on the sum of painted lengths**: - Since each of the 5 subintervals has a length of 0.1, the total maximum length of the painted segments is: [ 5 times 0.1 = 0.5 ] # Conclusion: Hence, the sum of the lengths of the painted segments does not exceed 0.5.

This allows us to assume without loss of generality that ( P_0(x) = 0 ) and ( P_2(x) ) is monic. This implies all ( P_i(x) ) (except ( P_0(x) )) are monic. We also deduce that ( P_1(x) = x ) and ( P_i(0) = 0 ) for each ( i ). 2. **Setting Up Polynomials**: - Let ( P_2(x) = x^2 + ax ) and ( P_3(x) = x^3 + bx^2 + cx ). We use the condition ( P_2(P_3(x)) = P_3(P_2(x)) ) and compare coefficients of ( x^4, x^3, x^2, x ) modulo ( q ): [ P_2(P_3(x)) = (x^3 + bx^2 + cx)^2 + a(x^3 + bx^2 + cx) ] [ P_3(P_2(x)) = x^6 + 2bx^5 + (b^2 + 2c)x^4 + (2bc + a)x^3 + (c^2 + ab)x^2 + acx ] Comparing coefficients, we get: [ 2b equiv 3a pmod{q} ] [ 2c equiv 3a^2 - b^2 + b pmod{q} ] [ a + 2bc equiv ab + a(a^2 + b) pmod{q} ] [ ab + c^2 equiv c + a^2b pmod{q} ] 3. **Case ( q = 2 )**: - For ( q = 2 ), we have ( a = 0 ), so ( P_2(x) = x^2 ). Now, using ( P_3(P_4(x)) = P_4(P_3(x)) ) and comparing coefficients, we find ( P_4(x) = x^4 ). ( P_3(x) ) can be any polynomial, so there are 4 cases for ( q = 2 ). 4. **Case ( q ge 3 )**: - Solving the system of equations, we get ( a^3 - 6a^2 + 8a = 0 ), which factors to ( a(a-2)(a-4) = 0 ). Thus, ( a = 0, 2, 4 ). - We claim these values uniquely determine the remaining ( P_i(x) ) for ( i ge 3 ). For a fixed degree ( i ), we have: [ P_i(x^2 + ax) = P_i(x)^2 + aP_i(x) ] Suppose ( Q_i(x) ) is a valid monic degree ( i ) solution. Let ( P - Q = R ) of degree ( < i ). Then: [ Q(x^2 + ax) + R(x^2 + ax) = Q(x)^2 + 2Q(x)R(x) + R(x)^2 + a(Q(x) + R(x)) ] Canceling terms, we get: [ R(x^2 + ax) = 2Q(x)R(x) + text{higher degree terms} ] Since ( 0 neq 2 pmod{q} ), this yields a degree contradiction unless ( R(x) = 0 ), hence ( P = Q ). 5. **Existence of ( Q_i(x) )**: - For ( a = 0 ), take ( Q_i(x) = x^i ). - For ( a = 2 ), take ( Q_i(x) = (x+1)^i - 1 ). - For ( a = 4 ), consider the Chebyshev polynomials transformed using the initial transformation. 6. **Counting Tasty Sequences**: - For ( q = 2 ), there are 4 cases. - For ( q ge 3 ), we sum over all odd primes ( le 47 ): [ 3 sum_{q text{ odd prime } le 47} q(q-1) ] - The total number of tasty sequences is: [ 4 cdot 2 cdot 1 + 3 sum_{q text{ odd prime } le 47} q(q-1) = boxed{30416} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, and a_1+a_8+a_{15} = pi, find the value of cos(a_4+a_{12}).

Therefore, a_1 + a_{15} = 2a_8. Given a_1 + a_8 + a_{15} = pi, we can substitute 2a_8 for a_1 + a_{15}, yielding 2a_8 + a_8 = 3a_8 = pi. From this, we find that a_8 = frac{pi}{3}. Now, let's find a_4 + a_{12}. Since the sequence is arithmetic, there is a common difference d such that a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. We can express a_4 and a_{12} in terms of a_8: - For a_4, we have a_4 = a_8 - 4d since it is 4 terms before a_8. - For a_{12}, we have a_{12} = a_8 + 4d since it is 4 terms after a_8. Now, a_4 + a_{12} = (a_8 - 4d) + (a_8 + 4d) = 2a_8. Since a_8 = frac{pi}{3}, we have a_4 + a_{12} = 2 cdot frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3}. Therefore, cos(a_4 + a_{12}) = cos(2a_8) = cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right).

Since x = -1 and x = 2 are the points where f(x) attains extreme values, the first derivative f'(x) must be zero at these points. So, we differentiate f(x) to get the first derivative: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 3) = 6x^2 + 2ax + b. Setting f'(-1) = 0 and f'(2) = 0, we get the system of equations: begin{align*} 6(-1)^2 + 2a(-1) + b &= 0, 6(2)^2 + 2a(2) + b &= 0. end{align*} These simplify to: begin{align*} 6 - 2a + b &= 0, 24 + 4a + b &= 0. end{align*} Solving these equations for a and b, we find a = -3 and b = -12.

Let's detail the steps: 1. **Initial Argument**: - Since the two players A and B have different movement rules and since each move reduces the number of potential moves left on the board, the game must have a finite number of moves. Therefore, the game necessarily ends with one player unable to make a move, resulting in a win for the other player. - Hence, either A or B must have a winning strategy. 2. **Assume A Does Not Have a Winning Strategy**: - If A does not have a winning strategy, no matter how A moves, B can always make the correct move to eventually win the game. 3. **Construct Two Hypothetical Games (Boards)**: - Consider two games being played on two separate 1994 times 1994 boards, called Board I and Board II. - In Board I, the game follows the original rules where A and B play alternately with A making horizontal moves and B making vertical moves. 4. **Board I Setup**: - Let A place the chess piece on square x and make their first move to square y. Then, it's B's turn to move. 5. **Board II Setup**: - On Board II, A places the chess piece on square y (the same square as their first move on Board I) and exactly mimics B’s moves from Board I. - The only difference between Board I and Board II is that on Board I, square x has been visited and cannot be stepped on again, whereas, on Board II, square x is still available. 6. **Key Observation**: - Because x and y are neighboring squares, they must be of different colors when, similar to a checkerboard pattern, every move alternates colors. - Since B always moves vertically, on Board I, B cannot move back to square x after A starts from square x and moves to square y (as x is a different color and adjacent). - A can therefore always mirror B's strategy on Board II without visiting x. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since B is assumed to win on Board I following its own strategy, A must win on Board II by copying B's strategy. - However, this would indicate that A has a winning strategy which contradicts our assumption that A does not have a winning strategy. Therefore, the conclusion is that A does have a winning strategy. [boxed{}]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively, and 2acos A=bcos Cccos B.

This is a true statement, so our initial inequality about sqrt{2} is correct. Given this, we can find the bounds for 2 + sqrt{2} and 4 - sqrt{2}: For 2 + sqrt{2}: - Since 1 < sqrt{2}, adding 2 to each part gives 3 < 2 + sqrt{2}. - Since sqrt{2} < 2, adding 2 to each part gives 2 + sqrt{2} < 4. - Combining these gives 3 < 2 + sqrt{2} < 4. For 4 - sqrt{2}: - Since 1 < sqrt{2}, subtracting from 4 gives 4 - sqrt{2} < 3. - Since sqrt{2} < 2, subtracting from 4 gives 2 < 4 - sqrt{2}. - Combining these gives 2 < 4 - sqrt{2} < 3. From these inequalities, we determine the integer and decimal parts: - For 2 + sqrt{2}, the integer part a = 3 and the decimal part b = 2 + sqrt{2} - 3 = sqrt{2} - 1. - For 4 - sqrt{2}, the integer part c = 2 and the decimal part d = 4 - sqrt{2} - 2 = 2 - sqrt{2}.

Let's construct a coordinate plane with point O as the origin (0,0) and line l as the x-axis. 2. Assume the equations of lines AB and CD passing through O are y = k_1 x and y = k_2 x, respectively. The coordinates of points are: - A(x_1, k_1 x_1) - B(x_2, k_1 x_2) - C(x_3, k_2 x_3) - D(x_4, k_2 x_4). 3. Since A, B, C, and D are circular points, the equation of the conic passing through these points is: [ lambda(y - k_1 x)(y - k_2 x) + left( y - k_1 x_{2} - frac{k_2 x_3 - k_1 x_1}{x_3 - x_1}(x - x_1)right)left( y - k_1 x_{2} - frac{k_2 x_4 - k_1 x_2}{x_4 - x_2}(x - x_2) right) = 0. ] 4. Simplifying this equation, we get: [ lambda k_1 k_2 x^2 + left( frac{k_2 x_3 - k_1 x_1}{x_3 - x_1} x - frac{(k_2 - k_1) x_3}{x_3 - x_1} x_1 right) left( frac{k_2 x_3 - k_1 x_2}{x_4 - x_2} x - frac{(k_2 - k_1) x_4}{x_4 - x_2} x_2 right) = 0. ] 5.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get: [ lambda a x^2 + (bx - c)(dx - e) = 0. ] This can be rewritten as: [ (lambda a + bd)x^2 - (be + cd)x + ce = 0. ] 7. Using Vieta's formulas for the roots (let the roots be OP and OQ) of the above quadratic equation, we have: [ OP + OQ = frac{be + cd}{lambda a + bd}, ] [ OP cdot OQ = frac{ce}{lambda a + bd}. ] 8.

If points M and N are symmetric with respect to the line x y 1 = 0, find the maximum value of the area of triangle Delta PAB.","completion":"Let's analyze the relationship between the circle and the line of symmetry first. If M and N are symmetrical with respect to the line x - y - 1 = 0, then the center of the circle x^2 + y^2 + kx = 0 must lie on that line. The center of the circle is (-frac{k}{2}, 0). Substituting into the line's equation gives: -frac{k}{2} - 0 - 1 = 0 implies k = -2. With k = -2, the equation of the circle becomes x^2 + y^2 - 2x = 0. The center of the circle is (1, 0), and the radius is 1 (since by completing the square, the equation is equivalent to (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1). Now, let's find the equation of the line AB. The slope of AB is frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-2)} = 1, so AB has the equation x - y +c = 0. Substituting point A into the line equation yields c = 2. Hence, the line AB is given by x - y + 2 = 0. The length of AB can be calculated by the distance formula: AB = sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}. The distance from the center of the circle (1, 0) to the line AB is frac{|1 - 0 + 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}. Since the height of Delta PAB (from P perpendicular to AB) is at most the distance from the circle’s center to the line plus the radius of the circle, the maximum value for the height is frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} + 1. The maximum area of Delta PAB can therefore be calculated as follows: max(text{Area of } Delta PAB) = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2} times left(frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} + 1right) = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2} times left(frac{3sqrt{2} + 2}{2}right).

This implies that d, which is a divisor of 18, must be one of its digits, and d must be 1, 2, or 9 (since d must be a single digit). Testing each viable d: 1. If d = 1, then 10^p = 18n.

We can write: [ c_n = a_n + b_n = (a_1 + (n-1)d_a) + (b_1 + (n-1)d_b) ] Rearrange the terms: [ c_n = (a_1 + b_1) + (n-1)(d_a + d_b) ] Thus, the sequence (c_n) is an arithmetic sequence with the first term (c_1 = a_1 + b_1 = 25 + 75 = 100) and common difference (d_c = d_a + d_b). 3. **Finding the Common Difference:** Since (a_{100} + b_{100} = 100), we use the formula for the (n)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: [ a_{100} = a_1 + 99d_a ] [ b_{100} = b_1 + 99d_b ] Given: [ a_{100} + b_{100} = (a_1 + 99d_a) + (b_1 + 99d_b) = 100 ] Substitute (a_1 = 25) and (b_1 = 75): [ (25 + 99d_a) + (75 + 99d_b) = 100 ] Simplifying, [ 100 + 99(d_a + d_b) = 100 ] Hence, [ 99(d_a + d_b) = 0 ] Therefore, [ d_a + d_b = 0 quad Rightarrow quad d_c = 0 ] 4. **Sum of the First 100 Terms:** Since (d_c = 0), the sequence (c_n) is constant and each term is 100.

Analyze positions for the other two squares: - **All three corners**: Select any of the other three corners. There are four choices for corners but due to diagonal symmetry, only two unique patterns. - **One corner, adjacent side squares**: Placing a square on two adjacent sides along with a corner each creates four more patterns (two for vertical and two for horizontal arrangement). - **Random positions but including a corner and center**: Placing the center square and a square in one of the non-adjacent corners/sides gives unique patterns due to different orientations.

If n is even, a_n is even, and (n+1)^{a_n} is odd. If n is odd, a_n is odd, and (n+1)^{a_n} is even. Thus, a_{n+1} has the same parity as n+1. 6. Therefore, a_k and k have the same parity.

The transformation rule involves changing the value of each cell based on the product of the values in its neighboring cells (those sharing a common edge, not including the cell itself). 2. **Invariant under transformation:** We observe that there are specific arrangements of numbers that do not change under the given transformation rule. For example, let's consider the three numerical tables shown in Figure 1 (not provided here, but we can infer from the context). 3. **Special pattern:** Suppose in our 9 times 9 grid, we fill the middle row and middle column entirely with +1. This effectively divides the grid into four 4 times 4 subgrids surrounding the center. 4. **Filling the subgrids:** Now, let's focus on filling these four 4 times 4 subgrids. We can choose one of the three invariant patterns (from Figure 1) and apply them to each subgrid. 5. **Invariant result:** Using one of the invariant patterns ensures that when we apply the transformation rule to the entire 9 times 9 grid, the filled values in each 4 times 4 subgrid remain unchanged. Hence, the 9 times 9 grid remains invariant under the transformation when the middle row and column are filled with +1. 6. **Conclusion:** Given the transformation rules and the invariant property of the chosen patterns, we cannot change all grid values to +1 via a finite number of transformations.

This means there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator greater than 1. Let's denote the numerator as (a = 12n + 1) and the denominator as (b = 30n + 1). We need to show that (text{GCD}(a, b) = 1). 1. **Expression Setup:** [ a = 12n + 1 quad text{and} quad b = 30n + 1 ] 2. **Linear Combination:** To determine (text{GCD}(a, b)), we can use the method of linear combinations. If we can express 1 as a linear combination of (a) and (b), then their (text{GCD}) must be 1. We need to find integers (x) and (y) such that: [ x(12n + 1) + y(30n + 1) = 1 ] To find such integers, observe the coefficients: [ 5(12n + 1) - 2(30n + 1) ] 3. **Calculation:** Let's expand and simplify: [ 5(12n + 1) = 60n + 5 ] [ 2(30n + 1) = 60n + 2 ] Subtract the second from the first: [ 60n + 5 - (60n + 2) = 60n + 5 - 60n - 2 = 3 ] Thus, [ 5(12n + 1) - 2(30n + 1) = 3 ] 4. **Conclusion:** This shows that the GCD of (12n + 1) and (30n + 1) must be either 1 or 3. However, since (12n + 1) is not divisible by 3 (since any number of the form (12k + 1) where (k) is an integer, will not give a remainder of 0 when divided by 3), the GCD cannot be 3.

For circle C with the polar equation rho = 2sqrt{2}sin(theta + frac{pi}{4}), expanding this gives rho^{2} = 2sqrt{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(rhosintheta + rhocostheta), which simplifies to x^{2} + y^{2} = 2y + 2x.

This means that there exist integers ( d_k = p_k^{g_k} ) (where ( p_k ) is a prime number) such that ( d_k mid a_k ) but ( d_k nmid F(x_k) ). 2. **Simplification by Prime Powers**: If within ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m ), there exist some prime numbers raised to different powers, we can focus on the smallest power of each prime. This is because if ( F(x) ) cannot be divided by a lower power, it certainly cannot be divided by a higher power of the same prime. Thus, we can select a subset ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_s ) which are pairwise co-prime (mutually prime). 3. **Application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem**: - By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for these pairwise co-prime integers ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_s ), there exists an integer ( N ) such that: N equiv x_k pmod{d_k}, quad k = 1, 2, ldots, s. - In other words, ( N ) is congruent to ( x_k ) modulo ( d_k ) for each ( k ). 4. **Difference Property of Polynomials**: - For polynomials with integer coefficients, the difference ( F(x) - F(y) ) is always divisible by ( x - y ). Applying this property, we write: F(N) - F(x_k) text{ is divisible by } d_k. - By our initial assumption, ( F(x_k) ) is not divisible by ( d_k ). Therefore, ( F(N) ) cannot be divisible by ( d_k ) either. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since ( d_k mid a_k ), and ( F(N) ) is not divisible by ( d_k ), ( F(N) ) is also not divisible by any ( a_k ). - This contradicts the initial condition that for any integer ( n ), ( F(n) ) can be divided by one of the integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ). - Thus, our assumption is incorrect. Conclusively, there exists at least one integer ( d ) among ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ) such that ( F(n) ) is divisible by ( d ) for any integer ( n ). boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The events A and B are independent, the probability that event A occurs is greater than 0, and the probability that event A occurs is some multiple of the probability that event B occurs.

Next, consider the angles ( alpha ) and ( alpha + 180^circ ). These angles are located in different quadrants: - ( alpha ) is an angle in any quadrant. - ( alpha + 180^circ ) places the angle exactly 180 degrees further, positioning it in a different quadrant but maintaining equivalent trigonometric properties for tangent. 4.

Let ( z_{k} ) be the complex number corresponding to point ( A_{k} ), for ( k=0,1, cdots, n-1 ).

Since no three points are collinear, each point on the surface can be connected to exactly one other point to form a hyperchord that is the diameter of the hypersphere. Given that 78% or fewer of the points touch the surface, we can calculate the maximum number of points on the surface as follows: Maximum number of points on the surface = 78% of 69 points = 0.78 * 69 = 53.82 Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 53 points.

We want to find the interval where the values of (a_n) lie on the trigonometric circle.

The sum of any five consecutive numbers must be positive. 2. The sum of any seven consecutive numbers must be negative. **Step-by-Step Analysis:** 1. **Initial Setup:** Let's denote the sequence of integers as (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots). We need to ensure that both constraints are satisfied for as many integers as possible in the sequence. 2. **Constraints Analysis:** - The sum of any five consecutive integers (a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3} + a_{i+4}) is greater than zero. - The sum of any seven consecutive integers (a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3} + a_{i+4} + a_{i+5} + a_{i+6}) is less than zero. 3. **Pairwise Analysis:** Consider that if we have a sequence of exactly 10 integers, the constraints set certain rules: - For the sums of five integers to be positive across the sequence means that not all integers can be negative. - For the sums of seven integers to be negative implies a need for a certain number of negative integers or smaller positive integers to balance and overall to create a negative effect. 4. **Deriving Relationships:** Assume (x) represents a positive number and ( -y) a negative number in the sequence. The two conditions give us these inequalities: [ 3x + 2(-y) > 0 implies 3x - 2y > 0 implies x > frac{2}{3} y ] [ 4x + 3(-y) < 0 implies 4x - 3y < 0 implies y > frac{4}{3} x ] 5. **Solving the Inequalities:** Combining both inequalities: [ frac{4}{3} x < y < frac{3}{2} x ] These constraints allow us to choose specific values for (x) and (y). For example, if (x = 5) and ( y = 7 ) (since (frac{4}{3} times 5 < 7 < frac{3}{2} times 5 )). 6. **Constructing the Sequence:** Let's create a sequence using the derived logic. The positive numbers and negative numbers must alter to satisfy the sum conditions: [ 5, -7, 5, -7, 5, 5, -7, 5, -7, 5 ] **Verification of the Sequence:** - Sum of any five consecutive integers: Always includes at least three positive and two negative values: Example: (5 + (-7) + 5 + (-7) + 5 = 1 > 0) - Sum of any seven consecutive integers: Example: (5 + (-7) + 5 + (-7) + 5 + 5 + (-7) = -1 < 0) 7. **Conclusion:** If the sequence extends beyond 10 integers, the above logic fails as it will violate one of the conditions by having too many positive or negative sums.

This equation has a unique solution with respect to b (where b > -1). Let t(b)=2mln (b+1)+frac{2}{b+1}+mln m-m-1. Then, t'(b)=frac{2m}{b+1}-frac{2}{(b+1)^{2}}=frac{2[m(b+1)-1]}{(b+1)^{2}}. When the system of equations has a solution, m > 0, so t(b) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (-1,-1+ frac{1}{m}), and monotonically increasing on the interval (-1+ frac{1}{m},+infty). So, t(b)_{min}=t((-1+ frac{1}{m})=m-mln m-1. As bto+infty, t(b)to+infty; as bto-1, t(b)to+infty. We only need m-mln m-1=0. Let u(m)=m-mln m-1. Then, u'(m)=-ln m is a monotonically decreasing function when m > 0. When m=1, u'(m)=0, i.e., u(m)_{min}=u(1)=0. So, when m=1, the equation 2mln (b+1)+frac{2}{b+1}+mln m-m-1=0 with respect to b has a unique solution.

Using the Law of Cosines on ( triangle ABC ) or ( triangle ADC ), we get: [ 1^2 = 1^2 + (3x)^2 - 2 cdot 1 cdot 3x cdot cos theta ] Simplifying, we have: [ 1 = 1 + 9x^2 - 6x cos theta ] [ 0 = 9x^2 - 6x cos theta ] Since ( x neq 0 ), we can divide by ( x ): [ 0 = 9x - 6 cos theta ] [ cos theta = frac{3x}{2} ] 4.

Let ( E ) be a point outside of the rhombus such that ( BE = a ) and ( AE = b ). Then ( triangle AEB ) is a right triangle, and we have: [ (3x)^2 = (1 + a)^2 + b^2 ] Substituting ( x = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ): [ left(3 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 = (1 + a)^2 + b^2 ] [ 3 = (1 + a)^2 + b^2 ] 6.

If we wish to have a flower bed with the greatest possible surface area, the radius of the circle in meters must be 7. How many meters of wire is available?","completion":"To maximize the surface area of the flower bed in the form of a circular sector, we need to use all the available wire to fence off the curved part of the sector and the two radii. The length of the wire will be equal to the length of the arc of the sector plus the lengths of the two radii. The formula for the circumference of a full circle is ( C = 2pi r ), where ( r ) is the radius. Since we have a sector, not a full circle, we need to determine the fraction of the circle that the sector represents. To maximize the area, we would use the entire wire for the perimeter of the sector, which means the sector would be a semicircle (half of a full circle) because any other fraction would result in a smaller area for a given perimeter. The circumference of a semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle plus the diameter (which is twice the radius). So, the length of the wire ( L ) will be: [ L = pi r + 2r ] Given that the radius ( r ) is 7 meters, we can substitute this value into the equation: [ L = pi times 7 + 2 times 7 ] [ L = 7pi + 14 ] Now, we can calculate the length of the wire: [ L = 7 times 3.14159 + 14 ] [ L approx 21.99115 + 14 ] [ L approx 35.99115 ] So, approximately boxed{36} meters of wire is available to fence off the flower bed."},{"prompt":"Find the number of positive integers n le 1200 such that 14n is a perfect square.","completion":"To solve this problem, we must find conditions under which 14n becomes a perfect square.

Let's say n = 14a. Then 14n = 14(14a) = 14^2a. For this to be a perfect square, a itself needs to be a perfect square; say, a = b^2. Therefore, we have: 14n = 196b^2 We are looking for the values of b^2 such that 14b^2 leq 1200.

Given that PAD is an equilateral triangle with side length 8, the side length of the base hexagon is half of that, which is 4. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula frac{s^2sqrt{3}}{4}. Therefore, the area of one of the equilateral triangles in the base is frac{4^2sqrt{3}}{4} = 4sqrt{3}.

We need to determine who can always win, regardless of the opponent's moves. To find the answer, consider the following strategy for Petya: 1. **First Move by Petya:** - Petya erases the number 50 and two other numbers whose sum is 100. - For instance, Petya can erase 1 and 99, since (1 + 99 = 100). - As a result of the first move, Petya erases (1, 50, 99). 2. **Strategy after the First Move:** - After this first move, the remaining numbers can be divided into pairs whose sums equal 100. - The pairs are ((2, 98), (3, 97), (4, 96), ldots, (49, 51)). 3. **Vasya's Moves:** - Vasya has to erase three numbers on his turn, but: - He can't erase both numbers in any pair because their sum is 100, meaning he would need a third number which sums to 150 minus 100 = 50 (50 was erased by Petya). - Thus, Vasya must erase three numbers from different pairs. 4. **Petya’s Response:** - Whenever Vasya erases numbers from different pairs, Petya can simply erase the remaining numbers of those pairs. For example: - If Vasya erases numbers (2, 3, 4) from pairs ((2,98), (3,97), (4,96)), Petya will erase (98, 97, 96)). - This ensures Petya always completes removing numbers from pairs disturbed by Vasya. 5. **Conclusion:** - Since the total sum of numbers in three pairs equals 300, and Vasya removes three numbers summing to 150, Petya can always follow by removing the remaining three numbers of those pairs. - Therefore, Petya will always have a valid move, and Vasya will eventually be unable to make a move first.

The even-position index in bc is c (position 2). - If we delete the second digit b, we are left with ac (even-position is now c). - If we delete the third digit c, we are left with ab (even-position is now b). - We will check each of the above to see if they result in a fair 2-digit number, namely, if they still result in the number of even digits in even positions being equal to those in odd positions. - Since the checks cover all potential patterns, the base case is true. - Thus, for any 3-digit number, we can always delete one digit and maintain a fair configuration. 2. **Inductive Step (Assume true for k = m):** - Assume that for any (2m + 1)-digit number, it’s possible to remove one digit to form a 2m-digit number that is fair. - Consider any (2(m+1) + 1)-digit number. - We need to prove this statement for (2m + 3) digits to form a 2(m+1)-digit fair number. 3. **Transform the (2(m+1) + 1)-digit number:** - Consider the (2(m+1) + 1)-digit number where we have: [ d_1 d_2 d_3 ldots d_{2m+2} d_{2m+3} ] 4. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis:** - By assumptions, if we remove any one of the first 2m+2 digits, by induction hypothesis, the remaining (2m+1)-digits have a digit that can be removed to result in a fair 2m-digit number. - Hence, removing any d_i from 1 to 2m+3, similar pattern arguments will work as above, resulting in fair behavior similarly. - Given these combinations ensure maintaining balance as required, the inductive step also holds.

We evaluate f(0) to check if the function could potentially be odd: [fleft(0right) = sin left(cos 0right) + cos left(sin 0right) = sin 1 + 1 neq 0] Since f(0) neq 0, f(x) cannot be an odd function because an odd function must have f(0) = 0.

For x=0: [f(0) = sin(cos0) + cos(sin0) = sin1 + 1 > frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 > sqrt{2}] This shows that at least at x=0, f(x) > sqrt{2}, indicating that the maximum value of f(x) is indeed greater than sqrt{2}.

Case 2: If 0 < a < 1, then 1 - a^2 would be between 0 and 1, which makes log_a(1 - a^2) positive, agreeing with the given condition. Therefore, we determine that 0 < a < 1. Since x > 1, we can now analyze each function individually: For f(x) = a^x, since 0 < a < 1 and x > 0, we know that f(x) will be decreasing, and 0 < f(x) < a^0 = 1. For g(x) = x^{frac{1}{3}}, as x > 1, we have g(x) > 1 because the cube root of any number greater than 1 is greater than 1 itself. For h(x) = log_a x, since 0 < a < 1 and x > 1, we have h(x) < 0 because logarithm to a base less than 1 of a number greater than 1 results in a negative number.

In his turn, Vasya names a number ( t ), and Petia informs him of one of the values ( f(t) ) or ( g(t) ) (without specifying which one he is reporting). After ( n ) turns, Vasya must determine one of Petia's polynomials. What is the smallest ( n ) for which Vasya has a strategy that guarantees he can achieve this?","completion":"Let's elaborate on the reference solution step by step. Consider that Petia has two quadratic polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ). Each polynomial is of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c ). Vasya's goal is to identify one of the polynomials chosen by Petia after making a set number of queries about the values of these polynomials at various points. 1. **Polynomials and Points**: Suppose Petia chooses two polynomials with maximum degree 2, and calls these ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ). The values of these polynomials at any chosen point ( t ) (which Vasya picks each time) are what Petia provides back to Vasya, selecting either ( f(t) ) or ( g(t) ), but without specifying which polynomial's value is given. 2. **Known Lemma**: We will use a lemma in our proof: - Lemma: Through any three points ( (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3) ) with distinct x-coordinates, there passes exactly one polynomial graph of ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ). 3. **Applying the Lemma**: According to the lemma, let's deduce: - For three distinct points ( (a_i, b_i) ), the quadratic polynomial passing through these points is unique. - Proof: Due to the properties of polynomials, the unique polynomial that fits through any three distinct points can be explicitly written as: b_1 frac{(x - a_2)(x - a_3)}{(a_1 - a_2)(a_1 - a_3)} + b_2 frac{(x - a_1)(x - a_3)}{(a_2 - a_1)(a_2 - a_3)} + b_3 frac{(x - a_1)(x - a_2)}{(a_3 - a_1)(a_3 - a_2)} - We conclude that no two distinct quadratic polynomials can share three points with the same x-values since their difference would then be a quadratic polynomial with three zeros, which is impossible unless the difference is the zero polynomial (the two polynomials are identical). 4. **The Strategy**: - Let's consider how many queries ( n ) Vasya needs to identify which polynomial Petia has. - Vasya's strategy will be based on distinct values ( t ) (ensuring no duplicate queries). 5. **Establishing ( n geq 8 )**: - Assume Petia marks points in response to Vasya's queries. - After ( 7 ) queries, with each resulting in a marked point, we observe how polynomials pass through these points. - Given different abscissae for each point, if Vasya fails to distinguish the two polynomials by the eighth point, it means that each polynomial fits into at least four points out of a possible seven points. 6. **Ensuring a Unique Polynomial**: - By the eighth point, if Vasya makes a good choice of ( t ), all marked points fit one and only one polynomial uniquely. - Suppose Petia picked points such that after ( 8 ) queries: the data uniquely fit a quadratic polynomial passing through any five of the eight points. Therefore, Vasya requires at least ( n = 8 ) distinct ( t )-values to determine uniquely either ( f(x) ) or ( g(x) ).

Similar transformation applies to sin15^circ which can be written as cos(90^circ - 15^circ) which equals cos75^circ. Therefore, sin30^circsin75^circ+sin60^circsin15^circ = sin30^circcos15^circ + sin60^circcos75^circ. 2. We can then apply the sum-to-product formulas by noticing that sin A cos B can be transformed into frac{1}{2}[sin(A+B)+sin(A-B)].

Recognize that sin(-15^circ) = -sin15^circ and sin135^circ is equivalent to sin45^circ due to symmetry in the unit circle for sine.

If it exists, find the range of real numbers m that satisfy the condition; if it does not exist, explain the reason.","completion":"To solve the problem, we follow these steps closely aligned with the given solution: 1. **Identify the properties of f(x)**: Since f(x) is an odd function defined on the set of real numbers R, we have f(0) = 0. This is because odd functions satisfy f(-x) = -f(x), and thus f(0) = -f(0), which implies f(0) = 0. 2. **Analyze the given inequality**: Given that f(x) is a decreasing function on R, the inequality f(4m-2mcos theta) + f(2cos^2theta - 4) > f(0) simplifies to f(4m-2mcos theta) - f(4-2cos^2theta) > 0 because f(0) = 0 and the property of odd functions allows us to rewrite f(-x) = -f(x). This implies f(4m-2mcos theta) > f(4-2cos^2theta). 3. **Transform the inequality**: Since f(x) is decreasing, for f(a) > f(b) to hold, it must be that a < b. Therefore, we have 4m-2mcos theta < 4-2cos^2theta. Simplifying this inequality, we get cos^2theta - mcos theta + 2m - 2 < 0. 4. **Change of variable**: Let t = cos theta, with theta in left[-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}right], which implies t in [0, 1]. The inequality becomes t^2 - mt + 2m - 2 < 0 for t in [0, 1]. 5. **Find conditions for m**: For the inequality t^2 - mt + 2m - 2 < 0 to always hold for t in [0, 1], we need both g(0) < 0 and g(1) < 0. Substituting t = 0 and t = 1 into the inequality gives us two conditions: - g(0) = 2m - 2 < 0 - g(1) = 1 - m + 2m - 2 < 0 Simplifying these conditions, we find that m < 1. 6. **Conclusion**: There exists such an m that satisfies the given condition, and the range of m is (-infty, 1).

Given that the driver's blood alcohol content decreases by 10% per hour, we can model this decrease using the formula: [1 times (1 - 10%)^{x} < 0.2] where x is the number of hours after the driver stops drinking.

We start with the given functional equation: [ f'(x) = frac{f(x+n) - f(x)}{n} ] for all real numbers ( x ) and all positive integers ( n ). 2. First, we consider the case when ( n = 1 ): [ f'(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) ] This implies that the derivative of ( f ) at ( x ) is equal to the difference between ( f(x+1) ) and ( f(x) ). 3. Next, we differentiate both sides of the equation ( f'(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) ) with respect to ( x ): [ f''(x) = f'(x+1) - f'(x) ] Since ( f'(x) = f'(x+1) ) (as shown in the initial solution), we have: [ f''(x) = 0 ] This implies that ( f'(x) ) is a constant function. 4. Let ( f'(x) = c ) for some constant ( c ). Integrating ( f'(x) = c ) with respect to ( x ), we get: [ f(x) = cx + d ] where ( d ) is an integration constant. 5. To verify that ( f(x) = cx + d ) satisfies the original functional equation, we substitute ( f(x) = cx + d ) into the equation: [ f'(x) = frac{f(x+n) - f(x)}{n} ] Calculating the right-hand side: [ frac{f(x+n) - f(x)}{n} = frac{c(x+n) + d - (cx + d)}{n} = frac{cx + cn + d - cx - d}{n} = frac{cn}{n} = c ] Since ( f'(x) = c ), the equation holds true. 6.

Combining the results from these inequalities, considering the intersection of the solutions, we find that m must satisfy: m > frac{4}{3} text{ and } m < frac{15}{7}. Recall that, from the discriminant, we also have that m geq m_2. Therefore, we need to ensure that m_2 lies within the interval left( frac{4}{3}, frac{15}{7} right). If it does, then the solution to the system is m in left[m_2, frac{15}{7}right). However, we can eliminate the need to find the exact roots by reasoning that if the discriminant inequality holds for all m geq m_2, and we already have a narrower constraint from the other conditions, we can simply take that narrower constraint as our solution. So, the final range of values for m is: boxed{m in left( frac{4}{3}, frac{15}{7} right)}."},{"prompt":"A sixdigit (decimal) number has six different digits, none of them 0, and is divisible by 37. Show that you can obtain at least 23 other numbers which are divisible by 37 by permuting the digits.","completion":"1. Let the six-digit number be (N = a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6). 2. Assume (N) is divisible by 37. 3. By the properties of divisibility, we first claim that the number obtained by rotating the digits ( a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1 ) is also divisible by 37. To prove this claim, we start by expressing: [ N = 10^5a_1 + 10^4a_2 + 10^3a_3 + 10^2a_4 + 10a_5 + a_6 ] Now, consider the number obtained by rotating the digits: [ M = a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1 ] This can be written as: [ M = 10^5a_2 + 10^4a_3 + 10^3a_4 + 10^2a_5 + 10a_6 + a_1 ] Notice that ( N equiv M ) modulo 37, because multiplying by a power of 10 in a cyclic decimal system (modulo 10^6 - 1) consists of a simple reordering of digits. Thus: [ 10N equiv 10(10^5a_1 + N') equiv 10 cdot 37k + 10N' = 37 cdot (10k) + N' equiv 37 cdot (10k) + N' equiv N' pmod{37} ] Where (N' = a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1). 4. As ( 37 mid N implies 37 mid N' ). 5. Based on this, iterating through the rotations, we can get 5 additional numbers, such as: [ a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6 ] [ a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1 ] [ a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1a_2 ] [ a_4a_5a_6a_1a_2a_3 ] [ a_5a_6a_1a_2a_3a_4 ] [ a_6a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5 ] Since all these cyclic permutations must also be divisible by 37. 6. Now let's consider a different permutation, ( a_1a_2a_3a_4a_6a_5 ). This can be rewritten as ( N - M = (a_6 - a_5) cdot 99999 ). Given (N) is divisible by 37, and knowing (99999 = 10^5 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{37}): [ a_1a_2a_3a_4a_6a_5 ] Is also divisible by 37. 7. Using similar analysis and rearranging digits, we can generate similar rotations and permutations while maintaining divisibility by 37 such as: [ a_1a_2a_6a_4a_5a_3 ] [ a_2a_6a_4a_5a_3a_1 ] ... and so forth as shown in the reference. 8. Reiterating the rotation argument shows that we can generate at least 23 additional numbers: [ begin{aligned} &a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6, &a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1, &a_3a_4a_5a_6a_1a_2, &a_4a_5a_6a_1a_2a_3, &a_5a_6a_1a_2a_3a_4, &a_6a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5, &a_1a_2a_6a_4a_5a_3, &a_2a_6a_4a_5a_3a_1, &a_6a_4a_5a_3a_1a_2, &a_4a_5a_3a_1a_2a_6, &a_5a_3a_1a_2a_6a_4, &a_3a_1a_2a_6a_4a_5, &a_1a_6a_2a_3a_4a_5,&ldots etc. end{aligned} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{23} ] This completes the proof, demonstrating that such permutations are commonly divisible by 37 yielding at least 23 valid numbers via these permutations."},{"prompt":"Given an ellipse with foci at (1,0) and (1,0), it intersects with the line y=x2.

Since the line x-y-2=0 intersects with the ellipse, substituting the line equation into the ellipse equation yields: (2b^{2}+1)x^{2}-4(b^{2}+1)x+3b^{2}+4-b^{4}=0.

Eccentricity (e) for an ellipse is defined as: e = sqrt{1 - left(frac{b}{a}right)^2} where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis. 3.

We begin by noting some key properties of the given geometric configuration. Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle S, with A_0 and C_0 being the midpoints of the arcs BC and AB that do not contain A and C, respectively. Circles S_1 and S_2 are centered at A_0 and C_0 and are tangent to BC and AB respectively. 2. Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC.

Similarly, draw the tangent IL from I to circle S_2 with L as the point of tangency. 4. Since A_0 is the midpoint of the arc BC (that does not include A), the angle bisector of angle BAC passes through A_0. Consequently, A_0 lies on the bisector of angle BAI. 5.

By the exterior angle theorem, we have: [ angle A_0IC = alpha + gamma ] 7. Given that I lies on the angle bisector of angle BAC, and recalling that A_0 lies on this bisector, we can assert that: [ angle A_0CI = alpha + gamma ] 8. This establishes that triangle A_0IC is isosceles with A_0I = A_0C. Furthermore, since S_1 is tangent to BC at its midpoint D, we observe the following: - Both triangles A_0IK and A_0DC are right-angled triangles. - They are congruent by the hypotenuse-leg (HL) theorem, because A_0I = A_0C and angle A_0IK = angle A_0DC. 9. This implies: [ angle A_0IK = angle A_0CD = alpha ] 10. Consequently, IK parallel AC. Similarly, by the same reasoning, IL parallel AC. 11.

Relative speed in m/s = 60 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = (60 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = (60/18) * 5 m/s Relative speed in m/s = (10/3) * 5 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 50/3 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to cross the man to find the length of the train. Length of the train = Relative speed * Time Length of the train = (50/3) m/s * 41.9966402687785 s Length of the train = (50/3) * 41.9966402687785 m Length of the train = (50 * 41.9966402687785) / 3 m Length of the train = 2099.83201343925 / 3 m Length of the train = 699.94400447975 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{699.944} meters."},{"prompt":"For an equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ) with an incircle ( O ) and a point ( P ) on the incircle ( O ), let the distances from ( P ) to the three sides of the triangle be ( x, y, z ).

Докажите, что в каждый цвет покрашено по 8 квадратиков. 1. Разделим каждую из 6 граней куба на 4 равных квадрата, так что всего у нас имеется (6 times 4 = 24) квадрата. 2. Согласно условию, два смежных квадрата (квадраты, имеющие общую сторону) должны быть окрашены в разные цвета. Для этого используют 3 цвета: скажем, цвета A, B, и C. 3. Рассмотрим, что происходит в вершине куба. В вершине куба сходятся три грани, и каждый квадрат, образующий вершину, должен быть окрашен в разный цвет. Давайте более подробно рассмотрим раскраску: Разбиение каждой грани: 4. На каждой грани мы располагаем 4 квадрата, следовательно, можно представить одну грань как квадрат 2x2. Внутренние квадраты взаимосвязаны друг с другом. Например, представим одну из граней и раскрасим квадраты: - ( A ) | ( B ) - ( C ) | ( A ) 5. Это обеспечивает, что ни один смежный квадрат на грани не имеет одинакового цвета. Анализ распределения по всему кубу: 6. Вершины, в которых сходятся три грани, требуют строгого разделения цветов на этих гранях: - Например, если одна из таких вершин содержит квадраты ( A, B, C ), то тот же порядок сохраивается для других вершин. К примеру, если на одной из граней у нас есть квадраты ( A, B, ), другая грань будет иметь квадраты ( C, A, B.) Учитывая множество граней: 7. Весь куб состоит из 8 вершин (по определению куба). 8. В каждой вершине сходятся три квадрата, которые должны быть раскрашены в три разных цвета (т.к. ни одна вершина не может иметь повторяющихся цветов согласно условиям). 9. Итак, выходит, что на все кубические вершины у нас приходится по одинаковому числу квадратов каждого цвета. Вывод: 10. Разбейте каждый из 24 квадратов по 8 каждого из трёх цветов: - Цвет ( A ) содержит 8 квадратов - Цвет ( B ) содержит 8 квадратов - Цвет ( C ) содержит 8 квадратов.

First, consider placing the largest number n at the beginning, so let a_{1} = n. Then, the number 1 must be adjacent to it to potentially minimize the product sum: [ a_{2} = 1 ] because pairing n with the smallest number results in the smallest product involving n. 3. Next, the number 2 should also be placed adjacent to the largest number but on the other end, so [ a_{n} = 2 ] since this will involve n in a smaller product sum when compared to interacting with other larger numbers. 4.

If Hannah's AdBlock blocks all but 20% of ads, it means that 80% of ads are blocked, and 20% are not blocked. Out of the 20% that are not blocked, 16% of the total ads are not interesting. Since these 16% are not blocked, they are part of the 20% that are allowed through. To find the percentage of the ads that aren't blocked and are actually interesting, we need to subtract the uninteresting ads from the total unblocked ads: Percentage of unblocked interesting ads = Total unblocked ads - Unblocked uninteresting ads Percentage of unblocked interesting ads = 20% - 16% Now, we calculate the difference: Percentage of unblocked interesting ads = 4% So, 4% of the total ads are both unblocked and interesting. This means that out of the 20% of ads that are not blocked, 4% are interesting. To find the percentage of these interesting ads relative to the unblocked ads, we divide the 4% by the 20% and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage of interesting ads among unblocked = (4% / 20%) * 100 Percentage of interesting ads among unblocked = (0.04 / 0.20) * 100 Percentage of interesting ads among unblocked = 0.2 * 100 Percentage of interesting ads among unblocked = 20% Therefore, boxed{20%} of the ads that aren't blocked by Hannah's AdBlock are actually interesting."},{"prompt":"Let a line m touch the incircle of triangle ABC .

Such numbers can be written in the form ( overline{aaa} ), where ( overline{aaa} = 111 times a ), and ( a ) is a digit from 1 to 9. 3.

Recall that if a circle is inscribed in a triangle, it implies equal tangential segments from each vertex to the points where the inscribed circle touches the triangle. 3. **Using Angle Properties**: Since the angle angle CBA = angle BDA holds by the properties of the circumscribed angle theorem and the trapezoid configuration: [ angle CBA = angle BDA ] This angle equality implies that triangle CDB and triangle BDA are isosceles and similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity. 4. **Triangle Similarity**: Using the similarity of triangles CDB and BDA: [ frac{CB}{BD} = frac{BD}{AD}, quad text{or} quad frac{18}{BD} = frac{BD}{8} ] 5. **Solve for BD**: Solving the above proportion: [ 18 times 8 = BD^2 implies BD = sqrt{144} = 12 ] 6. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**: Given that x = AB, x = BD = 12. 7. **Calculating the Perimeter**: Now, adding all sides to find the perimeter: [ P = AB + AD + BC + CD = 12 + 8 + 18 + 18 = 56 ] # Conclusion: The perimeter of trapezoid ABCD is: [ boxed{56} ]"},{"prompt":"Let [Q(x) = (3x^4 39x^3 + gx^2 + hx + i)(4x^4 64x^3 + jx^2 + kx + l),] where g, h, i, j, k, l are real numbers.

Using the condition and the cosine formula for double angles, we can derive (sin Asin B= frac{1-cos (A+B)}{2} ), which leads to (cos (A-B)=1). Since (-π < A-B < π), it follows that (A-B=0). **Solution** Given (sin Asin B-1=-sin^2 frac{C}{2}), we can derive (sin Asin B=cos^2 frac{C}{2} ), which leads to (sin Asin B= frac{1+cos C}{2} ). Therefore, (sin Asin B= frac{1-cos (A+B)}{2} ), (therefore 2sin Asin B=1-cos Acos B+sin Asin B), (therefore cos (A-B)=1).

According to the given information, when the article is sold for Rs. 1520, the percentage profit is equal to the percentage loss incurred when the article is sold for some other amount (let's call this amount X).

The measure of each exterior angle of the polygon can be found by subtracting the interior angle from 180^{circ}, because the sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is 180^{circ}. Therefore, the measure of each exterior angle is: [180^{circ} - 150^{circ} = 30^{circ}] 2. Knowing that the sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always 360^{circ}, we can find the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon by dividing the total sum of exterior angles by the measure of one exterior angle: [frac{360^{circ}}{30^{circ}} = 12] Thus, the polygon is a boxed{text{twelve-gon}}. **Problem 2:** Given that a polygon has 14 diagonals, we aim to find the sum of the interior angles of this polygon. 1. The formula to find the number of diagonals in a polygon with n sides is frac{n(n-3)}{2}. Setting this equal to 14 gives us the equation to solve for n: [frac{n(n-3)}{2} = 14] Simplifying, we get: [n^2 - 3n - 28 = 0] 2. Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for n, but we discard the negative value since the number of sides in a polygon cannot be negative. Thus, we find n = 7. 3. With 7 sides, the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be found using the formula 180^{circ}(n-2), where n is the number of sides.

Give an example of six real numbers not having this property.","completion":"1. **Substitution and Reformulation**: We start by substituting ( a_i = tan alpha_i ) for each of the seven real numbers. This transforms the inequality ( sqrt{3}|a - b| leq |1 + ab| ) into a trigonometric form. Using the tangent subtraction formula, we have: [ tan(alpha_i - alpha_j) = frac{tan alpha_i - tan alpha_j}{1 + tan alpha_i tan alpha_j} ] Therefore, the inequality ( sqrt{3}|a - b| leq |1 + ab| ) becomes: [ sqrt{3} |tan alpha_i - tan alpha_j| leq |1 + tan alpha_i tan alpha_j| ] Simplifying further, we get: [ |tan(alpha_i - alpha_j)| leq frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] 2. **Range of Angles**: The inequality ( |tan(alpha_i - alpha_j)| leq frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ) implies: [ -frac{pi}{6} leq alpha_i - alpha_j leq frac{pi}{6} ] This means that the difference between any two angles ( alpha_i ) and ( alpha_j ) must lie within the interval ( left[-frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{6}right] ). 3. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**: Consider the interval ( left[-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right] ). This interval has a total length of ( pi ). If we divide this interval into six subintervals, each of length ( frac{pi}{6} ), we get: [ left[-frac{pi}{2}, -frac{pi}{3}right], left[-frac{pi}{3}, -frac{pi}{6}right], left[-frac{pi}{6}, 0right], left[0, frac{pi}{6}right], left[frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{3}right], left[frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}right] ] By the pigeonhole principle, if we have seven angles ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_7 ) within this interval, at least two of them must lie within the same subinterval of length ( frac{pi}{6} ). Therefore, the difference between these two angles will be at most ( frac{pi}{6} ). 4. **Conclusion**: Since the difference between any two angles ( alpha_i ) and ( alpha_j ) is at most ( frac{pi}{6} ), it follows that: [ |tan(alpha_i - alpha_j)| leq frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] Hence, we have shown that among any seven real numbers, there exist two, ( a ) and ( b ), such that ( sqrt{3}|a - b| leq |1 + ab| ). 5. **Example of Six Real Numbers**: Consider the six real numbers corresponding to the angles ( -frac{pi}{2}, -frac{pi}{3}, -frac{pi}{6}, 0, frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{3} ).

If, after all points are colored, there exists an equilateral triangle with all vertices the same color, Vasha wins. We need to determine whether Bejia can prevent Vasha from winning. 2. **Strategy Outline:** To show Vasha's winning strategy, consider that: - Initially, there are less than 33 points colored. Vasha can make any move without worrying about immediate loss. - When 33 points are colored (with the possibility of red or blue), there is a specific move sequence Vasha can follow to ensure an equilateral triangle of the same color forms eventually. 3. **Proof of Vasha's Winning Strategy:** If 33 points are colored, consider any point ( A ) that is already colored and is on an edge of the colored segment. Let ( B ) be an adjacent uncolored point next to ( A ) such that ( B ) is close to another endpoint of some already colored segment. - There exists a point ( C ) such that ( triangle ABC ) forms an equilateral triangle. - Assume ( A ) is red (WLOG). When Vasha colors ( B ), he will color ( B ) the same color as ( A ) (red). 4. **Ensuring the Formation of an Equilateral Triangle:** Following this, Vasha continues: - Whenever Bejia colors a point near ( C ), Vasha waits and subsequently colors ( C ) red to form a red equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ), thereby winning. 5. **Permanent Winning Move:** This strategy ensures that Bejia cannot prevent the formation of such a monochromatic equilateral triangle: - If Bejia avoids coloring points around ( C ), colored points must be fewer than 33. - The last coloring steps must involve reaching out to points near ( C ), where Vasha executes his strategy to ensure ( triangle ABC ) becomes monochromatic. Thus, the strategy guarantees Vasha's win, whether by isolating segments early or directly coloring around crucial points to complete equilateral triangles. # Conclusion: Bejia cannot prevent Vasha from winning, as any strategy Bejia employs will eventually lead to a configuration where one equilateral triangle will have all vertices colored the same by Vasha.

We need to find the maximum number of piles that can be obtained. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - The maximum number of piles must be formed such that no two piles on the table at the same time differ by twice their size. 2. **Using the Reverse Process Approach:** - Starting from the highest possible number of piles and aggregating to ensure the conditions are met. - Assume we start by having 30 piles and verify if the conditions hold. 3. **Initialization of Piles:** - Suppose the initial piles are of sizes (15, 15, 16, 16, ldots, 29, 29). - These piles are chosen because: - They differ by at most 1 when paired. - The sum of these sizes should equal 660. 4. **Calculations to Verify the Initial Condition:** - The sequence (15, 15, 16, 16, ldots, 29, 29) includes each of the pairs from 15 to 29. - The sum is calculated step-by-step: [ 2(15 + 16 + 17 + ldots + 29) ] - Use the arithmetic series sum formula for each term: [ 15 + 16 + 17 + cdots + 29 = sum_{n=15}^{29} n ] - Sum up the numbers from 1 to 29, then subtract the sum of numbers from 1 to 14: [ sum_{n=1}^{29} n - sum_{n=1}^{14} n ] - Plugging in the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence ((frac{n(n+1)}{2})): [ frac{29(29+1)}{2} - frac{14(14+1)}{2} = frac{29 cdot 30}{2} - frac{14 cdot 15}{2} ] [ = 435 - 105 = 330 ] - Since each pair is counted twice: [ 2 cdot 330 = 660 ] 5. **Verification of the Condition:** - Verify that each pile pairs, differing by at most a small value: - ( |15 - 15| < 2 ) - ( |16 - 16| < 2 ) - ( |29 - 29| < 2 ) - All these pairs satisfy the required condition. 6. **Conclusion:** - By splitting conversely and grouping in reverse (checking that our hypothesis works), we verify the condition is met. - The maximum number of piles where no two piles differ by double is when we have 30 piles initially.

Length of the train (L_train) = Speed * Time taken to pass the man L_train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 meters Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cover the length of the platform. Since it takes 34 seconds to pass the entire platform and it takes 20 seconds to pass the man (which is the length of the train), the difference will give us the time taken by the train to cover the length of the platform. Time taken to cover the platform (T_platform) = Total time to pass the platform - Time to pass the man T_platform = 34 s - 20 s = 14 s Now, we can calculate the length of the platform (L_platform) using the speed of the train and the time taken to cover the platform. L_platform = Speed * T_platform L_platform = 15 m/s * 14 s = 210 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{210} meters."},{"prompt":"A 10cmby10cm square is partitioned as shown.

According to the information given, when the shopkeeper sells the article for Rs. 240, they gain 20%. This means that the selling price (SP) at a 20% gain is Rs. 240. We can express the 20% gain as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, which gives us 0.20. The relationship between cost price, selling price, and profit percentage is given by the formula: SP = CP + (Profit Percentage * CP) Using the information given for the 20% gain, we can write: 240 = CP + (0.20 * CP) 240 = CP (1 + 0.20) 240 = CP (1.20) Now, we can solve for CP: CP = 240 / 1.20 CP = 200 So, the cost price of the article is Rs. 200. Now, let's find out the loss percentage when the article is sold for Rs. 170.

The discriminant of the given equation is calculated as follows: [ Delta = (2k-1)^{2} - 4(k^{2}-1) = 4k^{2} - 4k + 1 - 4k^{2} + 4 = -4k + 5 ] For Delta geq 0, we have: [ -4k + 5 geq 0 implies k leq frac{5}{4} ] 2. **Apply Vieta's Formulas**: Vieta's formulas give us the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation as follows: - Sum of roots: x_{1} + x_{2} = -(2k-1) - Product of roots: x_{1}x_{2} = k^{2}-1 3. **Use the Given Condition**: The condition {x}_{1}^{2}+{x}_{2}^{2}=19 can be rewritten using the sum and product of roots.

Additionally, the denominator sqrt{2x+1} must be greater than zero to avoid division by zero and to keep the square root defined (as it cannot operate on negative numbers). So, we set the inside of the square root greater than zero: [ 2x+1 > 0 ] Solving for x gives: [ x > -frac{1}{2} ] Combining these two conditions, we find the intersection of the ranges where both conditions are true. Since x needs to be greater than -frac{1}{2} and at the same time be less than or equal to 3, the combined domain for g(x) is: [ -frac{1}{2} < x leq 3 ] Therefore, the domain of g(x)=frac{f(x-1)}{sqrt{2x+1}} is (-frac{1}{2}, 3]. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"prompt":"f the volume of a cone is equal to the volume of a sphere, and the radius of the base of the cone is equal to the diameter of the sphere, then the ratio of the lateral surface area of the cone to the surface area of the sphere is ______.","completion":"Let the radius of the sphere be r, thus the volume of the sphere is frac{4}{3}pi r^{3}. The radius of the base of the cone is 2r, let the height of the cone be h, since the volume of the cone is equal to the volume of the sphere, we have frac{4}{3}pi r^{3}= frac{1}{3}pi (2r)^{2}h, thus h=r, therefore, the slant height of the cone is sqrt{r^{2}+(2r)^{2}}= sqrt{5}r, hence, the lateral surface area of the cone is frac{1}{2} times (2pi times 2r) times sqrt{5}r=2 sqrt{5}pi r^{2}, and the surface area of the sphere is 4pi r^{2}, thus, the ratio of the lateral surface area of the cone to the surface area of the sphere is sqrt{5}: 2. Therefore, the answer is boxed{sqrt{5} : 2}. This question examines the knowledge of the volume and surface area of a sphere as well as the lateral surface area of a cone. By setting the radius of the sphere, and based on the given conditions, the relationship between the height of the cone and the radius of the sphere is derived. Then, by relating the slant height of the cone to the radius of the sphere, and combining the formulas for the surface area of the sphere and the lateral surface area of the cone, the ratio can be obtained."},{"prompt":"Compute: (x^{3}y^{4})^{1} cdot (x^{2}y^{1})^{2} = ______ .","completion":"First, apply the power rule for exponents to both terms: (x^{-3})^{-1} cdot (y^{-4})^{-1} cdot (x^{2})^{2} cdot (y^{-1})^{2}.
