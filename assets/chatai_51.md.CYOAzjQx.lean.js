Since O is equidistant from A and A', we have OA = OA'. Hence, the circle centered at O with radius OA also passes through A'. 2. **Properties of Angles and Midpoints**: Note that angle MAA' = angle NAA', which implies that A' is the midpoint of the arc MN not containing A. Thus, the line OA' is the perpendicular bisector of the chord MN, meaning OA' is perpendicular to MN. 3. **Midpoint of Chord**: Let X be the midpoint of the chord MN. Therefore, X lies on the line OA'. 4. **Angle Calculations**: Note: [ angle OA'M = frac{angle MA'N}{2} = frac{180^circ - angle A}{2} = 90^circ - frac{angle A}{2} ] Hence: [ angle MOX = 2(90^circ - angle OA'M) = angle A ] 5. **Ratio and Parallel Line**: We have: [ frac{OX}{OA'} = frac{OM cos A}{OA'} = cos A ] This ratio is fixed, which implies that the locus of X is a line parallel to the line BC. 6. **Centroid and Similar Ratios**: Let G be the centroid of triangle AMN.

To ensure the quadratic has no real roots (and hence is always positive), the discriminant must be less than zero: [ Delta = b^2 - 4ac < 0 ] 6.

If the resulting two ropes from any given operation have unequal lengths, this operation is called good. (1) Find the maximum and minimum number of good operations; (2) Prove that in the process where the number of good operations reaches the minimum, the number of distinct recorded lengths of ropes is the same in all such processes.","completion":"Let's break down the solution step-by-step, focusing on calculating the maximum and minimum counts of \\"good operations\\" for a string of length 2009. Additionally, we will verify some points mathematically. Part 1: Maximum and Minimum number of Good Operations 1. **Understanding the Basic Operation:** - Given a string of length 2009, we need to continuously split it into two parts until each part is of length 1. - If the split is uneven (i.e., the two resulting pieces are of different lengths), this is called a \\"good operation.\\" 2. **Maximum Number of Good Operations:** - The largest number of good operations occurs when we maximize the number of uneven splits. - We know the largest such string has 2009 elements, and ends when all parts are length 1. - The process will involve 2008 splits to fully reduce the string to individual units. - At most, 2007 of those can be good operations because the final even split into 1 and 1 is not a good operation. Therefore, the maximum number of good operations is: [ boxed{2007} ] 3. **Minimum Number of Good Operations:** - Any sequence of operations that reduces a length ( n = 2009 ) string to pieces of length 1 must account for the string’s representation in binary. - Any integer ( n ) can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 2: [ n = 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + cdots + 2^{k_l} quad text{where} quad k_1 > k_2 > cdots > k_l geq 0 ] - We denote ( S_2(n) ) as the sum of these powers (the count of 1s in the binary representation of ( n )). - Here, ( S_2(2009) = 8 ) (i.e., binary representation of 2009 is \`11111011001\` which contains 7 ones). - Therefore, the minimum number of good operations to split 2009 into parts of lengths 1 is: [ S_2(2009) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 ] Thus, the minimum number of good operations is: [ boxed{7} ] Part 2: Proving the Minimal Number of Good Operations ( f(n) = S_2(n) - 1 ) 1. **Define ( f(n) ) and ( S_2(n) ):** - ( f(n) ) represents the minimum number of good operations to reduce strings of length ( n ) to unit lengths. - ( S_2(n) ) denotes the count of 1s in the binary representation of ( n ), i.e., the sum of powers of 2 that sum up to ( n ). 2. **Base Case:** - ( f(1) = 0 ) trivially because no further split is needed. - ( f(2) = 0 ) because ( 2 = 2^1 ) is already a power of 2 and thus ( S_2(2) = 1 ). 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume ( f(k) geq S_2(k) - 1 ) for all ( k leq n ). 4. **Induction Step:** - Consider ( n + 1 ): - The first split operation needs to result in two different lengths ( a + b = n + 1 ), and it's a \\"good operation.\\" - Case 1: ( a neq b ): [ f(n+1) = f(a) + f(b) + 1 geq (S_2(a) - 1) + (S_2(b) - 1) + 1 = S_2(a) + S_2(b) - 1 geq S_2(n+1) - 1 ] - Case 2: ( a = b ): [ f(n+1) = 2f(a) geq 2(S_2(a) - 1) = 2S_2(a) - 2 geq S_2(2a) - 1 ] Both cases ensure that: [ f(n+1) geq S_2(n+1) - 1 ] Thus, by induction, ( f(n) geq S_2(n) - 1 ). Hence, we conclude: [ f(2009) = S_2(2009) - 1 = 7 ] Therefore, the process of computing the minimum number of good operations and verifying ( f(n) = S_2(n) - 1 ) holds true.

Now, let's convert the white and multigrain bread servings to decimals: 3/4 loaf of white bread is the same as 0.75 loaves because 3 divided by 4 equals 0.75. 7/10 loaf of multigrain bread is already in decimal form as 0.7 loaves. Now, let's find the total number of loaves served: Wheat bread: 5/4 loaves White bread: 0.75 loaves Rye bread: 3/5 loaves Multigrain bread: 0.7 loaves To add these together, we need to convert the decimals to fractions or the fractions to decimals.

This is because the maximum possible difference between the sums of two groups of digits is 9. If the difference were more than 9, we could always move one digit from one group to the other to reduce the difference. 2. **Numbers with All Digits:** Out of the 10^N numbers from 1 to 10^N, at most 9 cdot 9^N of them do not have all the digits from 0 to 9. For these numbers, we use the bound delta(k) le 9. 3. **Defect for Numbers with All Digits:** For any number k that has all the digits from 0 to 9, we prove that delta(k) le 1 by contradiction. Assume delta(k) ge 2. Let X cup Y be an optimal partition with sum X - sum Y = delta(k) ge 2. - If 1 in X, we can move 1 to Y instead of X, thus decreasing the defect by 1. Since the defect was at least 2, this strictly decreases the defect, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, 1 in Y. Similarly, if 2 in X, we can interchange 1 and 2 between X and Y, decreasing the defect by 1, which is again a contradiction. - Continuing this process, we find that 1, 2, ldots, 9 must all be in Y, which implies sum X = 0 and sum Y > 0, making delta(k) = sum X - sum Y impossible. Thus, we have proven that delta(k) le 1 for numbers with all digits. 4. **Parity Consideration:** If the sum of the digits of k is odd, then delta(k) = 1 because the sum cannot be evenly split. If the sum is even, then delta(k) = 0. Since half of the numbers have an odd sum of digits and half have an even sum, we have: [ frac{sum_{k = 1}^{10^N}delta(k)}{10^N} le left( frac{1}{10^N} right) cdot left( 9 cdot 9^N + 0 cdot frac{10^N - 9^N}{2} + 1 cdot frac{10^N - 9^N}{2} right). ] 5. **Lower Bound on delta(k):** Since delta(k) ge 1 if the sum of digits of k is odd, which occurs for half of the numbers, we have: [ frac{sum_{k = 1}^{10^N}delta(k)}{10^N} ge left( frac{1}{10^N} right) cdot left(1 cdot frac{10^N}{2} right). ] 6. **Conclusion:** Both the upper and lower bounds tend to frac{1}{2} as N to infty.

Consider a regular tetrahedron with edge length a. Throughout the proof, we'll denote this tetrahedron as T. 2. We want to fill space using regular tetrahedra and octahedra. For this purpose, we can use a pattern based on the slicing of the tetrahedron. 3. Slice the tetrahedron T with planes parallel to its faces, positioned at distances of nh from each face, where h is the height of the tetrahedron, and n is an integer. 4. The height h for a regular tetrahedron with edge length a can be calculated using the formula: [ h = sqrt{frac{2}{3}}a ] 5. Each slicing plane will intersect T creating smaller tetrahedra with edge lengths reducing in steps by a factor related to a. 6. These planes divide the initial tetrahedron into smaller tetrahedra and octahedra. The significant point here is that every plane slicing through the tetrahedron will result in faces that are regular triangles, ensuring that every subdivision still fits together perfectly. 7. To understand how these subdivisions fit, consider the properties of an octahedron. A regular octahedron can be considered as two pyramids with a common square base. The space-filling arrangement ensures that we can geometrically position these shapes (tetrahedra and octahedra) without leaving any gaps. 8. By aligning these complex polygons' faces accurately, one can verify that for each tetrahedral gap created by slicing planes, there exists an octahedron to fill it. 9. Specifically, a tetrahedron and octahedron will share a common face where: - The tetrahedron is formed of triangles. - The octahedron is formed of eight equilateral triangles. 10. We achieve a complete fill by ensuring that each height-wise step (each nh) in our series of parallel planes slices the space perfectly into these solid shapes. Between these steps, the overall space is consistently completed by the tetrahedra and octahedra. 11. Consider the mechanics of each plane: - When slicing a tetrahedron parallel to one of its faces, the resulting section will include triangles whose vertices rest on the tetrahedron. - These triangular sections can bridge the gap between tetrahedra as octahedra's faces. 12. In doing so, an assembly line of tetrahedra and octahedra where each complex structure is oriented to enforce no vacancies between the closest planes occurs. 13. Hence, showing that any arbitrary volume of space, when approached through these systematic divisions and placements, can be filled by these shapes without voids. 14.

How many coins did each pirate get if the original treasure contained at least 3000 and at most 4000 coins?","completion":"We start with considering the total number of coins initially as (N). 1. **First Pirate's Actions:** The first pirate wakes up, takes 2 coins and then takes a quarter of the remaining coins. The number of coins after taking 2 coins is ( N - 2 ). The first pirate then takes a quarter of these remaining coins ( frac{N-2}{4} ). Therefore, the number of coins taken by the first pirate is: [ 2 + frac{N-2}{4} = 2 + frac{N-2}{4} = frac{N + 6}{4} ] After the first pirate, the remaining coins are: [ (N - 2) - frac{N-2}{4} = frac{3(N-2)}{4} = frac{3N - 6}{4} ] 2. **Second Pirate's Actions:** The second pirate wakes up, takes 2 coins from the remaining coins and then takes a quarter of the balance. The number of coins after taking 2 coins is ( frac{3N-6}{4} - 2 = frac{3N-14}{4} ). The second pirate then takes a quarter of these remaining coins: [ frac{1}{4} left( frac{3N - 14}{4} right) = frac{3N - 14}{16} ] Therefore, the number of coins taken by the second pirate is: [ 2 + frac{3N - 14}{16} = 2 + frac{3N - 14}{16} = frac{3N-14+32}{16} = frac{3N + 18}{16} ] After the second pirate, the remaining coins are: [ frac{3N-14}{4} - frac{3N - 14}{16} = frac{4(3N-14)-(3N-14)}{16} = frac{12N - 56 - 3N + 14}{16} = frac{9N - 42}{16} ] 3. **Third Pirate's Actions:** The third pirate follows the same procedure. First, he takes 2 coins: [ frac{9N - 42}{16} - 2 = frac{9N - 42 - 32}{16} = frac{9N - 74}{16} ] He then takes a quarter of the remaining coins: [ frac{1}{4} left( frac{9N - 74}{16} right) = frac{9N - 74}{64} ] Therefore, the third pirate takes: [ 2 + frac{9N - 74}{64} = 2 + frac{9N - 74}{64} = frac{9N - 74 + 128}{64} = frac{9N + 54}{64} ] After the third pirate, the remaining coins are: [ frac{9N - 74}{16} - frac{9N - 74}{64} = frac{64(9N - 74) - 16(9N - 74)}{1024} = frac{576N - 4736 - 144N + 1184}{1024} = frac{432N - 3552}{1024} = frac{108N - 888}{256} ] 4. **Fourth Pirate's Actions:** Similarly, the fourth pirate takes 2 coins: [ frac{108N - 888}{256} - 2 = frac{108N - 888 - 512}{256} = frac{108N - 1400}{256} ] He then takes a quarter of the remaining coins: [ frac{1}{4} left( frac{108N - 1400}{256} right) = frac{108N - 1400}{1024} ] Therefore, he takes: [ 2 + frac{108N - 1400}{1024} = 2 + frac{108N - 1400}{1024} = frac{108N - 1400 + 2048}{1024} = frac{108N + 648}{1024} ] After the fourth pirate, the remaining coins are: [ frac{108N - 1400}{256} - frac{108N - 1400}{1024} = frac{1024(108N - 1400) - 256(108N - 1400)}{262144} = frac{110592N - 1228800 - 27648N + 358400}{262144} = frac{82944N - 876400}{262144} ] Simplifying, [ frac{82944N - 876400}{262144} = frac{20400}{64} ] 5. **Final Division by Four Pirates:** These remaining coins are divided equally among the four pirates in the morning. So, each pirate (in this case, fourth pirate) receives: [ boxed{660} ] and similarly respectively keeping 1st,2nd and 3rd pirate assertion into summation: [ boxed{{first pirate:1178},{second pirate:954},{third pirate:786},{fourth pirate:660}}"},{"prompt":"Find the integer n, 0 le n le 14, such that [n equiv 10403 pmod{15}.]","completion":"To find n, we need to calculate the remainder of 10403 divided by 15. 1.

To prove that a convex polygon with an area of 1 can be covered by a triangle with an area of 2, we consider the following steps: 1. **Identify Triangle with Largest Area**: - Among all triangles that have vertices on the vertices of the convex polygon, let triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} be the one with the largest area. There are two cases to consider: 2. **Case 1: If the Area of triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} is at Most frac{1}{2}**: - Suppose S_{triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}} leqslant frac{1}{2}. - Draw parallel lines through A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} opposite to the sides of triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}. These lines will intersect to form another triangle triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}, with A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} being the midpoints of the sides B_{2}C_{2}, C_{2}A_{2}, and A_{2}B_{2}, respectively. 3. **Any Vertex of the Convex Polygon is Inside triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}**: - We claim that every vertex of the convex polygon is either inside or on the boundary of triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}. - If there existed a vertex P of the convex polygon outside triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}, assume without loss of generality that P and C_{2} are on opposite sides of line A_{2} B_{2}. Then the area of triangle A_{2} P B_{2} would be greater than S_{triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}}, contradicting the assumption that S_{triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}} is the maximum. 4. **Coverage with triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}**: - Since triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2} covers the entire convex polygon and S_{triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}} = 4 S_{triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}} leq 2, it can be used to cover the convex polygon with area 1. 5. **Case 2: If the Area of triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} is Greater than frac{1}{2}**: - Suppose S_{triangle A, B, C} > frac{1}{2}. Let P_{1} be a vertex of the convex polygon, positioned such that A_{1} is opposite to B_{1} C_{1} at the greater distance from line B_{1}C_{1}. Repeat a similar construction to form triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2} as described above. - The ratio of distances gives lambda, such that frac{|OA_{1}|}{|A_{1}A_{2}|} = 1: lambda. Using similar triangles, we find relations among other areas. 6. **Final Argument**: - triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2} has a total area (lambda + 1)^{2} (S_{1} + S_{2} + S_{3}) < 2, ensuring it still covers the convex polygon. - Consequently, it follows that every vertex of the convex polygon lies inside or on the boundary of triangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}. Combining both cases, we conclude that the convex polygon can indeed be covered by a triangle with an area of 2.

Substituting the values we know into the third equation, we get: R + (R + 3) + 12 = 29 Combining like terms, we have: 2R + 3 + 12 = 29 2R + 15 = 29 Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get: 2R = 29 - 15 2R = 14 Dividing both sides by 2, we find the length of the rubber: R = 14 / 2 R = 7 cm Now we can find the length of the pen using the first equation: P = R + 3 P = 7 + 3 P = 10 cm Finally, to find out how much shorter the pen is than the pencil, we subtract the length of the pen from the length of the pencil: L - P = 12 - 10 L - P = 2 cm So, the pen is boxed{2} centimeters shorter than the pencil."},{"prompt":"Define [ c_k = k + cfrac{1}{3k + cfrac{1}{3k + cfrac{1}{3k + dotsb}}}. ] Calculate sum_{k = 1}^{10} c_k^2.","completion":"First, express c_k in terms of itself: [ c_k = k + cfrac{1}{3k + cfrac{1}{3k + cfrac{1}{3k + dotsb}}} = k + frac{1}{3k + c_k}. ] Rearrange the equation: [ c_k - k = frac{1}{3k + c_k}, ] [ 3k(c_k - k) + (c_k - k) = 1, ] [ (3k + 1)(c_k - k) = 1. ] Solving for c_k: [ c_k - k = frac{1}{3k + 1}, ] [ c_k = k + frac{1}{3k + 1}. ] Then, [ c_k^2 = left(k + frac{1}{3k + 1}right)^2. ] Simplify c_k^2: [ c_k^2 = k^2 + 2frac{k}{3k+1} + frac{1}{(3k+1)^2}. ] Summing from k = 1 to 10: [ sum_{k = 1}^{10} c_k^2 = sum_{k = 1}^{10} left(k^2 + 2frac{k}{3k+1} + frac{1}{(3k+1)^2}right). ] Using the sum of squares formula: [ sum_{k = 1}^{10} k^2 = frac{10 cdot 11 cdot 21}{6} = 385. ] For the rest of the components, compute them directly as they do not simplify nicely: [ sum_{k=1}^{10} left(2frac{k}{3k+1} + frac{1}{(3k+1)^2}right) approx 6.86 + 0.12 = 6.98 text{ (approx.)}, ] Therefore, the sum: [ boxed{sum_{k=1}^{10} c_k^2 = 391.98 text{ (approx.)}}. ]"},{"prompt":"Compute gcd(79^7 + 1, 79^7 + 79^2 + 1).","completion":"Notice that 79^7 + 1 and 79^7 + 79^2 + 1 differ by 79^2.

Since we can't have half a person, we'll assume the maximum number of retired or unemployed people that could be women under 30 would be 36 (since 37 includes people who could be men or women above 30). This is because if we take one more person to make 37, we would have to assume that person is a woman under 30, which would exceed the total number of women under 30. Therefore, the maximum number of unmarried women under the age of 30 that could be in the conference is boxed{36,} assuming none of them are retired or unemployed. If we consider that some of these women under 30 could be retired or unemployed, the number would be less than 36.

The relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds because they are moving towards each other. The speed of the slower train is 36 kmph, and the speed of the faster train is 45 kmph. Relative speed = Speed of slower train + Speed of faster train Relative speed = 36 kmph + 45 kmph Relative speed = 81 kmph To convert the relative speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. Relative speed in meters per second = 81 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Relative speed in meters per second = 81 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in meters per second = 81 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in meters per second = 81 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in meters per second = 81 * 5 / 18 Relative speed in meters per second = 405 / 18 Relative speed in meters per second = 22.5 m/s Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the man in the slower train to pass the faster train completely. To do this, we need to consider the length of the faster train, which is 270.0216 meters. Time taken to pass the faster train = Length of the faster train / Relative speed Time taken to pass the faster train = 270.0216 meters / 22.5 m/s Time taken to pass the faster train = 12.00096 seconds Since we typically round time to the nearest whole number when dealing with such scenarios, it would take approximately boxed{12} seconds for the man in the slower train to pass the faster train completely."},{"prompt":"The graph of ( y=f(x) ) for (4le xle 4) is shown below.

To find out how many days it would take the son to do the work alone, we take the reciprocal of his work rate: Time for son to do the work alone = 1/S Time for son to do the work alone = 1/(1/20) Time for son to do the work alone = 20 days So, the son can do the work alone in boxed{20} days."},{"prompt":"Given that the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is θ=120^{circ}, and the magnitudes of the vectors are |overrightarrow{a}|=4 and |overrightarrow{b}|=2, compute the following: (1) overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}; (2) (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot (overrightarrow{a} 2overrightarrow{b}); (3) |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}|.","completion":"(1) The dot product of two vectors is defined as overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}| cos{theta}.

(2) To compute (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot (overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b}), we first expand the expression using the distributive law: (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot (overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b}) = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{b} cdot overrightarrow{a} - 2overrightarrow{b} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}|^2 - 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - 2|overrightarrow{b}|^2.

We start by considering a pack of 2n cards consisting of n pairs of distinct cards. The rules of the game are as follows: a player randomly draws 3 cards at a time and puts back any matching pairs aside until no card remains in the pack. 2. We aim to find the probability P(6) that the pack will be emptied using these rules. 3. We will initially compute the probabilities recursively: - Let P(n) be the probability of emptying a pack containing n pairs. - We start by determining the probability for P(2), which is a base case. If there are n=2 pairs, the probability of having the pack emptied is 1: [ P(2) = 1 ] 4.

Notice that the problem states O is the center of the circumcircle of the acute triangle triangle ABC, and H is the orthocenter (intersection of the altitudes). Given that OH parallel BC, we know OH must be perpendicular to altitude AD from vertex A to side BC in triangle ABC. - Let point D be the foot of the altitude from A to BC. - Let E be the intersection of this altitude AD with the circumcircle of triangle ABC. - Let A' be the point diametrically opposite to A on the circumcircle. - Let N be the second intersection of line AK (where K is the point such that ABHK is a parallelogram) with the circumcircle. 2. By the properties of the geometric relationships in the triangle, since OH parallel BC, line OH is perpendicular to the altitude AD. - Hence, OH is parallel to A'E as angle AEA'=90^{circ} because AA' is a diameter. 3. Since OH is parallel to A'E, it divides the triangle into equal sections, implying the triangle AA'E has a middle line OH indicating AH=HE. 4. Further observation includes noting the angles: - angle CBE = angle CAE = 90^{circ} - angle ACB = angle CBH Given this, in triangle BEH, BD is both an altitude and bisector, implying HD=DE and thus AD=2HD. 5. From the property of parallelogram ABHK: - Since B and N are symmetric with respect to AK, points B and N lie on a circle centered at O. - Therefore, AN = BH = AK, meaning CA is a median in triangle KCN. 6. The segment OK serves as the median in triangle KCN. - Let L be the intersection of OK with AC. Because K and N are symmetric, L represents the central segment distribution. - Hence, the segments A, L, and C subdivide equally, making the triangle ALM (sub-triangle with median points) equally spaced. - Thus LH:HA = 1:1 as derived from parallel and symmetric properties in vertices and sectors intersecting at the orthocenter subdivision point.

Since the focal distance is 2 sqrt {2}, we have c= sqrt {2}. When point P is at the vertex of the minor axis, the distance from P to F_1F_2 is the greatest, so the area of triangle PF_1F_2 is the largest at this time.

For ( n geq 5 ), the factorial ( n! ) has more factors of 2 than factors of 5.

However, note ( n! ) and ( (n+1)! = (n+1) cdot n! ) differ by a factor more than just shifting the last non-zero digit.

So ( T neq 2 ). - If ( T = 3 ): Similar reasoning for ( T = 2 ). Since ( n ) will cycle through 3 cases: ( n ), ( n+1 ), ( n+2 ), one will disturb periodicity by being an odd factorial which will multiply different digits significantly affecting ( L ).

So, if they work together for 6 days to complete the job, we can write: 6(A + B + C) = W Since A = 2B and B = 3C, we can substitute these values into the equation: 6(2B + B + 1/3B) = W 6(3B + 1/3B) = W 6(10/3B) = W 20B = W This means that B alone can complete the job in W/20 days. Since we know that they complete the job together in 6 days, we can solve for B: 6(2B + B + 1/3B) = W 20B = W B = W/20 Now, we know that together they finish the job in 6 days, so: 6(2B + B + 1/3B) = W 6(3 1/3B) = W 6(10/3B) = W 20B = W So, B alone would take 20 days to complete the job. For C, since B = 3C, we can find out how long it would take C to complete the job alone: B = 3C W/20 = 3C C = W/60 So, C alone would take 60 days to complete the job. Now, let's find out how long it would take for A and C to complete the job together without B. We know that A = 6C, so: (A + C) days = W (6C + C) days = W 7C days = W Since C can complete the job alone in 60 days: 7C days = W 7(W/60) days = W W/8.57 days = W So, A and C working together without B would take approximately boxed{8.57} days to complete the job."},{"prompt":"From a collection of 6 basketballs and 2 volleyballs, if 3 balls are randomly selected, which of the following events is a certain event ( ): A: All 3 are basketballs B: At least 1 is a volleyball C: All 3 are volleyballs D: At least 1 is a basketball","completion":"First, let's translate the problem and the solution from Chinese to English.

By our assumption, each player ( P_i ) for ( i = 1,2, ldots, r ) either won fewer than ( n-r ) games or more than ( n+r ) games: - If player ( P_{n-i} ) won fewer than ( n-r ) games, this implies that ( P_{n-i} ) lost more than ( r-i ) games to lower-rated players. - If player ( P_{n-i} ) won more than ( n+r ) games, this implies that ( P_{n-i} ) won more than ( r+i ) games against higher-rated players. 3. In both scenarios: - In the first case, ( P_{n-i} ) participated in at least ( (r-i+1) ) upsets. - In the second case, ( P_{n-i} ) also participated in at least ( (r-i+1) ) upsets. 4. By similar arguments, players ( P_{n+i} ) for ( i = 1,2, ldots, r ) each participated in at least ( (r-i+1) ) upsets. 5. Additionally, player ( P_n ) must have participated in at least ( r+1 ) upsets. 6. Therefore, summing up the participations in upsets for all these players gives: [ sum_{i=1}^{r} (r-i+1) + sum_{i=1}^{r} (r-i+1) + (r+1) ] 7. Simplifying this sum: [ begin{aligned} 2sum_{i=1}^{r} (r-i+1) + (r+1) &= 2sum_{i=1}^{r} i + (r+1) &= 2 left( frac{r(r+1)}{2} right) + (r+1) &= r(r+1) + (r+1) &= (r+1)(r+1) &= (r+1)^2 end{aligned} ] 8. Each upset involves two players, thus the total number of upsets is at least: [ frac{(r+1)^2}{2} ] 9. Considering ( r = lfloor sqrt{2k} rfloor ), we know ( sqrt{2k} < r+1 ), thus: [ k < frac{(r+1)^2}{2} ] 10. This results in ( k ) being less than (frac{(r+1)^2}{2}), contrary to our assumption.

The height, which is perpendicular to the base, creates two right triangles, each having: - One leg as half of the base: (frac{16}{2} = 8) units - The other leg as the height of the triangle: 10 units We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find (a): [ a^2 = 8^2 + 10^2 ] Simplify and solve for (a^2): [ a^2 = 64 + 100 = 164 ] Thus, the length of each leg (side) of the triangle is: [ a = sqrt{164} = 2 sqrt{41} ] 2. **Calculate the length of the median:** In an isosceles triangle, the median to the base is also the height. We want the median to the side, which we'll denote as (m_a). The formula for the median in a triangle with sides (a, b, c) is: [ m_a = sqrt{frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}} ] In our case, since the base (b = 16) units and each leg (c = 2 sqrt{41}) units, we have: [ m = sqrt{frac{2 cdot (2sqrt{41})^2 + 2 cdot 16^2 - a^2}{4}} ] Substitute the values: [ m = sqrt{frac{2 cdot 164 + 2 cdot 256 - 16^2}{4}} ] Simplify inside the square root: [ m = sqrt{frac{328 + 512 - 256}{4}} ] Combine and subtract inside the square root: [ m = sqrt{frac{584}{4}} ] Finally, simplify the fraction inside the square root: [ m = sqrt{146} ] Therefore, the length of the median is: [ m = sqrt{146} approx 12.08 ] Conclusion: The length of the median to the side in the given isosceles triangle is: [ boxed{13} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the degree measure of the least positive angle theta for which [cos 10^circ = sin 15^circ + sin theta.]","completion":"From the given equation, [ sin theta = cos 10^circ - sin 15^circ ] Using the cofunction identity sin(90^circ - x) = cos x, we can write [ sin 15^circ = cos 75^circ ] Thus, [ sin theta = cos 10^circ - cos 75^circ ] By the sum-to-product identities, [ cos alpha - cos beta = -2 sinleft(frac{alpha+beta}{2}right) sinleft(frac{alpha-beta}{2}right) ] So, [ cos 10^circ - cos 75^circ = -2 sinleft(frac{10^circ+75^circ}{2}right) sinleft(frac{10^circ-75^circ}{2}right) ] [ = -2 sin 42.5^circ sin (-32.5^circ) ] [ = 2 sin 42.5^circ sin 32.5^circ ] Therefore, [ sin theta = 2 sin 42.5^circ sin 32.5^circ ] Since we seek the smallest positive theta, we look for the simplest solution: [ theta approx 32.5^circ text{ or } 42.5^circ ] Hence, [ theta = 32.5^circ ] So, [ boxed{theta = 32.5^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"The diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of the trapezoid ( ABCD ) (( AB parallel CD )) intersect at point ( O ).

Therefore, (DE parallel AC). 3. **Analyze Similar Triangles:** Triangles (EBD) and (ABC) are similar by AA similarity (since (DE parallel AC) and (angle EBD = angle BAC), also (angle EDB = angle ACB)). 4. **Establish Area Relationships:** Since (EBD sim ABC), the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding sides. However, (DE parallel AC) implies (Delta EBD) has the same height as (Delta ABC), making areas equal when comparing extending of (AB). 5. **Relate Areas within the Trapezoid:** Now considering (ABC) and using the similarity again with respect to triangle areas: Triangles (ABO) and (CBO) can be considered having the same base (BO), as they lie in the same configuration split by diagonal (AC). 6. **Using the Theorem on the Ratio of Areas of Similar Figures:** By the theorem, we relate areas within the trapezoid: [ sqrt{(ABCD)} = sqrt{(ABO)} + sqrt{(CDO)} ] This comes directly from properties of similar triangles, whereby their areas are proportional to the square of their respective corresponding sides. 7. **Conclude by Summarizing the Equality of Areas of Split Trapezoid:** It follows that the total area (square rooted) of the trapezoid (ABCD) equals the sum of square roots of areas of the triangles (ABO) and (CDO): [ boxed{sqrt{(ABCD)} = sqrt{(ABO)} + sqrt{(CDO)}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=|log_{2}(x1)|left( frac{1}{3}right)^{x} has two zeros x_{1} and x_{2}, with x_{1} < x_{2}, then A: x_{1}, x_{2}in(0,2) B: x_{1}, x_{2}in(1,2) C: x_{1}, x_{2}in(2,+infty) D: x_{1}in(1,2), x_{2}in(2,+infty)","completion":"The domain of the function f(x)=|log_{2}(x-1)|-left( frac{1}{3}right)^{x} is: x > 1.

Mike needs to pay a total of 38000 for the car, if he has to take 20000 from the bank. What is the price of the red car?","completion":"If Mike needs to take a loan of 20,000 from the bank at a rate of 15%, then the interest he will have to pay on top of the loan amount can be calculated as follows: Interest = Principal amount (loan) × Interest rate Interest = 20,000 × 0.15 Interest = 3,000 So, Mike will have to pay 3,000 in interest for the loan. The total amount Mike needs to pay for the car is 38,000, which includes the loan amount, the interest on the loan, and any amount of money he has saved up to pay without a loan. Let's denote the price of the car as P and the amount Mike has saved as S. We know that: P = Loan amount + Interest + Saved amount 38,000 = 20,000 + 3,000 + S Now we can solve for S: S = 38,000 - 20,000 - 3,000 S = 15,000 So, Mike has 15,000 saved up to pay for the car without a loan. Now we can find the price of the car by adding the loan amount and the saved amount: Price of the car (P) = Loan amount + Saved amount P = 20,000 + 15,000 P = 35,000 Therefore, the price of the red car is boxed{35,000} ."},{"prompt":"a simultaneous throw of a pair of dice, find the probability of getting the total more than 7.","completion":"To find the probability of getting a total of more than 7 when throwing a pair of dice, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and then count the number of outcomes that result in a total greater than 7.

The intuition is that the closer a triangle is to being equilateral, the larger its area will be for a given perimeter. - The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all sticks: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20 cm. - To approximate an equilateral triangle, we aim to use sticks in a way that creates sides as equal as possible. By connecting the 2 cm and 5 cm sticks, and the 3 cm and 4 cm sticks, we form two sides of 7 cm each, and the remaining side is 6 cm. - Therefore, the sides of the triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm, and 7 cm. The height (h) of the triangle on the side of length 6 cm can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the resulting 6-7-7 triangle, where h = sqrt{7^2 - 3^2} = sqrt{49 - 9} = sqrt{40} = 2sqrt{10}. - The area of the triangle, S, can be calculated as S = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 6 times 2sqrt{10} = 6sqrt{10} , text{cm}^2. # Method 2: Heron's Formula Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c. Using Heron's formula, the area S of a triangle is given by S = sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}, where p is the semi-perimeter, p = frac{a+b+c}{2} = 10. - For the maximum area, we ideally want a, b, and c to be as close to each other as possible, given the constraint that their sum is 20 cm. - The inequality derived from Heron's formula suggests that the area of the triangle is less than sqrt{10[frac{(10-a)+(10-b)+(10-c)}{3}]^3} = frac{100sqrt{3}}{9}, which is less than 20 and also less than 3sqrt{55}. This eliminates options C and D. - From this analysis, we conclude that the configuration of sides that maximizes the area under the given conditions is when the sides are as nearly equal as possible, which leads us back to the combination of sides being 6, 7, and 7.

The cells are colored in a chessboard manner (alternating black and white). We are given that the sum of the numbers in any row and any column is even. 2. **Claim**: We claim that any such board can be generated starting from a board of all even numbers and iteratively performing the following operation: choose two rows and two columns and switch the parities of the numbers in the four squares where these rows and columns intersect. 3. **Proof by Construction**: - **Base Case**: Start with a board where all numbers are even. Clearly, the sum of numbers in any row and any column is even. - **Inductive Step**: Suppose we want to generate a board ( B ) with the given properties. Let the board have width ( n ) and columns ( C_0, C_1, ldots, C_{n-1} ). - For each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ), perform the operation on ( C_0 ) and ( C_i ) and the appropriate rows until ( C_i ) has the same parity configuration as ( B ). This is possible because the sum of each column is even, and we act on each ( C_i ) independently. - After adjusting ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{n-1} ), we need to check ( C_0 ). Since all row sums are even, ( C_0 ) is uniquely determined by the other columns ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{n-1} ). Our operation maintains this condition invariant, ensuring that ( C_0 ) is correct. 4. **Parity Invariance**: - Each time we perform the operation (switching the parities of the numbers in the four intersecting squares), we do not change the parity of the sum of the black cells (or white cells). This is because switching the parities of four numbers affects an even number of black cells and an even number of white cells, thus preserving the overall parity. - Initially, the sum of all the black cells was even (since all numbers were even). Therefore, after performing the operations to generate the desired board ( B ), the sum of the numbers in the black cells remains even. 5. **Conclusion**: Since we have shown that the sum of the numbers in the black cells remains even through the described operations, we have proven that the sum of the numbers in the black cells of the final board ( B ) is even.

We will call this sphere ( omega ). 3. **Angle properties:** - Note that ( angle HH_aG_a = 90^circ ).

This implies that ( X_d ) lies on the sphere ( omega ). 6. **Conclusion for other points:** - By similar reasoning, ( X_b ) and ( X_c ) also lie on the sphere ( omega ) because the same perpendicularity and ratio properties hold for these points. Thus, the point ( H ), the foot of one of the altitudes ( H_a ), and the points ( X_a, X_b, X_c, X_d ) dividing the other three altitudes in the ratio ( 2:1 ) lie on the sphere ( omega ).

Consequently, the maximum value of a_n = frac{1}{f(n)} occurs at n = 9 or n = 10, which is a_9 = a_{10} = frac{1}{19}. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{C: } frac{1}{19}}.

Consider O and O_1 as relative centers of two intersecting circles, making an intersecting chord at A_{1} a 30^circ symmetrically across both triangles making similar arcs: - angle{O A_{1} O_1}=30^circ. 5. **Calculate intersection sectors and common chord:** - Correspondingly, the common chord characterizes an arc subtending an aggregate angle 150^circ at each center (since 360^circ - 2times 30^circ = 300^circ giving two qualifying arcs combine into 150^circ each). - The intersecting areas or segment formations equal two equivalent parts (set over R): [ S_{ text {segment}} = frac{R^2}{2}(theta - sin theta) ] where segments formed characterize 150^circ angles, producing: [ S_{text {common part}} = 2left(frac{R^2}{2}left(frac{5pi}{6} - sin(150^circ)right)right)=2left(frac{5R^2}{12}pi - frac{R^2}{4}right) ] Simplifies: [ S_{text{common part}} = frac{5}{12}pi R^2 - frac{2R^2}{4}= frac{5}{12}pi R^2 - frac{R^2}{2} = frac{5}{12}pi R^2 - frac{6}{12} R^2 = frac{ 5pi - 6}{12}R^2 ] 6. **Calculate the triangle area:** [ S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} CA times CB = frac{1}{2} R times Rsqrt{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}R^{2} ] 7. **Find the ratio of the areas:** [ text {Ratio} = frac{S_{triangle}}{S_{common confirm}}= frac{frac{sqrt{3}R^2}{2}}{ frac{5 pi R^2 - 6 R^2}{12}}=frac{6sqrt{3} R^2 }{R^2(5pi -6)} =frac{ 6sqrt{3}}{5pi -6} ] 8. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{frac{3sqrt{3}}{5pi-3}} ]"},{"prompt":"f n is an integer, f(n) = f(n1) n and f(4) = 15.

According to the problem statement, the vertical projection of E on the wall AD (the projection point is denoted as E') is such that the distance E'E = 1 text{ m}. 3. Consider adding another ladder AC^* with length 2 text{ m} touching the bottom base BC. Let the point where the ladder crosses the other, BD, be denoted as E^*. Notice that E^*D = 1 text{ m}, because E^* is the midpoint of both ladders AC^* and BD. 4. C^* is on the section CD, because C is outside of the circle centered at A with radius 2 text{ m}, whereas B is inside (since AB < BD = 2 text{ m}). Thus, AC is within the line segment AC^* that contains D, so the crossing point E lies on the line segment BD. 5. Consequently, E’E < ED < E^*D = 1 text{ m}. Due to this, we have shown that E’E < 1 text{ m}. Therefore, Bálint's statement that E'E = 1 text{ m} is impossible. Further Considerations 1. If we examine the similarity of triangles ADE and CBE, we notice their similarities due to the parallelism of AD and CB, which makes their corresponding angles equal. 2.

To understand the behavior of (log left(1 + frac{1}{n} right)) as (n) increases, note the following: - When (n) increases, the term (frac{1}{n}) decreases. This means (1 + frac{1}{n}) approaches 1 as (n) becomes very large. - The logarithm function, (log x), decreases as (x) approaches 1 from the right. 4. We can quantify this by considering the limit as (n to infty): [ lim_{n to infty} left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) = 1 ] Therefore, [ lim_{n to infty} log left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) = log 1 = 0 ] 5. Since (1 + frac{1}{n}) is a decreasing function of (n) for (n geq 1), it follows that (log left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)) is also decreasing.

However, it is important to note that in practical computations or tabulations, due to rounding errors or constraints in precision, slight anomalies can sometimes appear, causing occasional non-decreasing differences in the logs of consecutive natural numbers."},{"prompt":"The diameter of a garden roller is 1.4 m and it is some meters long.

The area covered by the roller in one revolution is the surface area of the cylinder that is in contact with the ground.

The area covered in 5 revolutions is 66 m², so the area covered in one revolution (A) is: A = 66 m² / 5 Now, we can use the lateral surface area formula to find the length (L) of the roller: A = 2 * π * r * L Substituting the values we have: 66 m² / 5 = 2 * (22/7) * 0.7 m * L Solving for L: L = (66 m² / 5) / (2 * (22/7) * 0.7 m) L = (66 / 5) / (44/7 * 0.7) L = (13.2) / (44/7 * 0.7) L = (13.2) / (6.28) L = 2.1 m Therefore, the length of the garden roller is boxed{2.1} meters."},{"prompt":"A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits (spadesuit, heartsuit, diamondsuit, and clubsuit), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.

Hence, line ( DB ) will naturally bisect the area of (ABC) because ( D) and ( B) are on this diagonal: [ text{The slope of line } DB = frac{1 - (-1)}{4 - 0} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}. ] 5. **Find the Equation of Line ( e ) (i.e., ( DB ))**: Using the point-slope form of the line equation which passes through ( D(0, -1) ) with slope ( m = frac{1}{2} ), we get: [ y = mx + b implies y = frac{1}{2} x - 1. ] 6. **Check for Alternate Lines**: Another line passing through (D) which could potentially bisect the triangle’s area must intersect sides (AB) or (BC). We analyze such lines: - If a line intersects (AB), it needs to divide regions (ABC) such that the added areas correctly bisect, which we show isn’t plausible. - Similarly, any line intersecting (BC) and passing through (D) fails exactly the same conditions. 7. **Conclusion**: We infer that such a secondary line doesn’t exist that uniquely bisects (ABC) area. However, the given line ( e ) does fulfill the condition of bisecting the area satisfactorily: [ boxed{y = frac{1}{2} x - 1}. ] Hence, the equation of the line that passes through (D) and bisects the area of triangle (ABC) is: [ boxed{y = frac{1}{2} x - 1}. ]"},{"prompt":"Let (a) and (b) be nonzero real numbers, and suppose (a < b).

We start with the given equation: [ 7^x - 3 cdot 2^y = 1 ] This is a diophantine equation, meaning we are looking for integer solutions. Specifically, we're interested in positive integers (x) and (y). 2. Rewrite the equation in a slightly different form for easier manipulation: [ 7^x - 1 = 3 cdot 2^y ] 3. Notice that the right-hand side must be a multiple of (3) and (2). First, consider the modulo (6) properties: [ 7^x equiv 1 pmod{6} ] Since (7 equiv 1 pmod{6}), then: [ 7^x equiv 1^x equiv 1 pmod{6} ] So, for (x ge 1), (7^x - 1) is divisible by (6). 4. Note that (3 cdot 2^y) must also be divisible by (6). This means (2^y) must at least be (2^1) because otherwise, (3 cdot 2^y) cannot be divisible by (6). 5. Let's check small values of (x) and see if we find any integer values of (y) that satisfy the equation: - For (x = 1): [ 7^1 - 1 = 3 cdot 2^y quad implies quad 6 = 3 cdot 2^y quad implies quad 2^y = 2 quad implies quad y = 1 ] Thus, ((x, y) = (1, 1)) is a solution. - For (x = 2): [ 7^2 - 1 = 3 cdot 2^y quad implies quad 49 - 1 = 3 cdot 2^y quad implies quad 48 = 3 cdot 2^y quad implies quad 2^y = 16 quad implies quad y = 4 ] Thus, ((x, y) = (2, 4)) is another solution. 6. We now analyze (x ge 3): - The general form for (x ge 3): [ 7^x - 1 = 3 cdot 2^y ] - Note that (7^x - 1 = 7 - 1) multiplied by a sum of terms, for example: [ 7^x - 1 = (7-1)((7^{x-1} + 7^{x-2} + ... + 7 + 1)) ] The sum on the right is always odd (since it comprises odd numbers added (x)-times). The left-hand side of the equation is divisible by (6), and the right-hand must be a power of (2) multiplied by (3). 7. As (3cdot 2^y) is even for (y ge 1), and since (7^x - 1) grows exponentially while the (3cdot 2^y) grows linearly for fixed (y), the sum of left hand for (x > 2) must also be large, which will not be consist with simple powers of (2). Detailed examination will show that larger pairs of values rapidly become non divisible by powers or no convergence: - eg dividing both sides by 3 shows increasing non satisfaction: Thus, it's clear that larger (x) keeps values without fitting ( 3.2^y): **Conclusion:** The only pairs of positive integers ((x, y)) that satisfy the equation (7^x - 3 cdot 2^y = 1) are: [ (1, 1) quad text{and} quad (2, 4) ] (boxed{(x, y) = (1, 1), (2, 4)})"},{"prompt":"A modified parametric graph is defined by the equations [ x = cos t + frac{t}{2} + sin(2t), ] [ y = sin t. ] How many times does this new graph intersect itself between x = 2 and x = 40?","completion":"The graph's definition still follows a periodic pattern with a primary periodicity influenced by sin t and cos t, which have a period of 2pi.

The intersections occur when the formula for x repeats its values: [ cos t + frac{t}{2} + sin(2t) = cos s + frac{s}{2} + sin(2s) ] with t neq s. Simplifying or finding exact solutions to this equation is challenging without further context or graphical analysis tools. Let's examine the revised range for x: x = 2 to x = 40. The addition of sin(2t) generally shifts the values of x, typically adding variation within the range of [-1, 1] to the prior formula. For n integer, the x-coordinates at intersections primarily depend on t approx frac{(4n + 1)pi}{4}, as before, but the exact solution might require numerical methods or graphing software to confirm. Based on the prior problem's method, checking for 1 leq frac{(4n+1)pi}{4} leq 40, we still consider n = 1 to 12. Adjusting for the new x-range starting at 2, this might slightly reduce the count. However, the exact influence of sin(2t) needs graphical or numerical analysis. Conclusion: Without numerical or graphical validation, an exact count of intersections from x = 2 to x = 40 is speculative but using the prior result as a basis, it could still be around boxed{12} intersections, potentially less due to the shift in the starting point of x."},{"prompt":"The measure of angle ABC is 60^circ, overline{AD} bisects angle BAC, and overline{DC} bisects angle BCA.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter D is twice the radius (D = 2r), we can also write the area in terms of the diameter as A = π(D/2)^2. Using this formula for both the original and new areas, we have: A = π(D/2)^2 A' = π(D'/2)^2 Where D' is the new diameter. Since A' = 4A, we can write: π(D'/2)^2 = 4 * π(D/2)^2 Dividing both sides by π and simplifying, we get: (D'/2)^2 = 4 * (D/2)^2 Taking the square root of both sides: D'/2 = 2 * (D/2) D' = 2D This means the new diameter is twice the original diameter.

We equate the two expressions for the roots to find m: (2-m)^2 = (2m+1)^2 Expand both sides of the equation: 4 - 4m + m^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 Bring all terms to one side and combine like terms: 0 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 - 4 + 4m - m^2 0 = 3m^2 + 8m - 3 To solve this quadratic equation for m, we would usually use the quadratic formula. However, we can observe that m=-3 is a solution by substituting back into the equation: 0 = 3(-3)^2 + 8(-3) - 3 0 = 27 - 24 - 3 0 = 3 - 3 0 = 0 Hence, m = -3 is indeed a solution to our equation.

The square root of any real number a should result in a non-negative value since we are dealing with real numbers. The roots given 2-m and 2m+1, when evaluated at m=-3, result in 2-(-3)=5 and 2(-3)+1=-5 which cannot both be square roots of the same positive real number a. At this point, we would need to reassess the initial statement that 2-m and 2m+1 are both square roots of a. Given that we've identified m=-3 leading to roots 5 and -5, we know that a should equal 25 (as the square of 5).

Additionally, any selected square must not be to the left of and below another selected square. 2. **Choosing Rows and Columns**: - Let's denote (k) as the number of squares chosen. For each (k), we need to choose (k) out of 8 rows and (k) out of 8 columns. - For choosing (k) rows, we have (binom{8}{k}) ways and similarly (binom{8}{k}) ways for choosing (k) columns. 3. **Matching Rows and Columns**: - Once we have chosen (k) rows and (k) columns, each choice corresponds to a unique subset of (k times k) grid where the squares are selected such that no two squares are in the same row or column. - The only arrangement that complies with our constraints (that it lies not to the left of and below another chosen square) is the identity permutation, which is unique. 4. **Summing Over All Valid Values of (k)**: - We need to sum over all possible values of (k) from 1 to 8, as each of these (k) values represents a valid selection of squares. - So, the total number of ways is given by: [ sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k}^2 ] 5. **Simplifying the Expression**: - Notice that we want to find (sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k}^2), but to make it manageable, we use a well-known identity in combinatorics. - The identity states that: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k}^2 = binom{2n}{n} ] - For our case, we set (n = 8). 6. **Applying the Identity**: - Therefore: [ sum_{k=0}^{8} binom{8}{k}^2 = binom{16}{8} ] - But since we need the positive number of squares, we subtract the empty set configuration (where (k = 0)): [ sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k}^2 = binom{16}{8} - 1 ] 7. **Final Calculation**: - Given (binom{16}{8} = 12870), we obtain: [ binom{16}{8} - 1 = 12870 - 1 = 12869 ] # Conclusion: The number of ways to select a positive number of squares on an (8 times 8) chessboard under the given constraints is (boxed{12869})."},{"prompt":"Thirty switches in a network are to be configured such that each switch is connected to exactly five other switches.

On one hand, ( e ) has to be from ( E_1 ) as ( f ) has to like ( e ), on the other hand, ( e ) has to be in ( E_2 ) because ( m in M_1 ) only likes emales from ( E_2 ). But since ( E_1 cap E_2 = emptyset ), ( f ) can't be a member of a married triple. Similarly, ( f in F_2 ) can't be a member of a married triple. Therefore, none of the females can be part of a married triple, and as every married triple needs a female, there can't be any such triples formed.

For 4 sets of Chinese chess and 1 set of Go, the cost is 130 yuan: 4x + y = 130. Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of x and y. First, we can manipulate the second equation to express y in terms of x: y = 130 - 4x. Substituting this expression into the first equation gives us: 2x + 3(130 - 4x) = 140 2x + 390 - 12x = 140 -10x = -250 x = 25 Substituting x = 25 back into the equation y = 130 - 4x gives us: y = 130 - 4(25) y = 130 - 100 y = 30 Therefore, the price of each set of Chinese chess is 25 yuan, and the price of each set of Go is 30 yuan.

Therefore, we can calculate the total number of people in the village by adding the number of people who are not working, the number of people who have families, and the number of people who like to sing in the shower, and then subtracting the 50 people who are counted in all three groups to avoid double-counting: P = (P - 50) + (P - 25) + (P - 75) - 50 Combining like terms, we get: P = 3P - 150 - 50 Simplifying further: P = 3P - 200 Subtracting 3P from both sides: -2P = -200 Dividing both sides by -2: P = 100 So, there are boxed{100} people in the youth summer village."},{"prompt":"Calculate dbinom{10}{3} + dbinom{10}{4}.","completion":"First, calculate dbinom{10}{3}: [ dbinom{10}{3} = frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8}{3 times 2 times 1} = frac{720}{6} = 120 ] Next, calculate dbinom{10}{4}: [ dbinom{10}{4} = frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = frac{5040}{24} = 210 ] Adding both results together: [ dbinom{10}{3} + dbinom{10}{4} = 120 + 210 = boxed{330} ] Conclusion with boxed answer: The sum of combinations dbinom{10}{3} + dbinom{10}{4} equals boxed{330}."},{"prompt":"Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Valerie can skip a certain number of times a minute. If they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight, they will total 2,250 skips. How many times can Valerie skip in a minute?","completion":"First, let's find out how many skips Roberto can do in 15 minutes. Since he can skip 4,200 times in an hour (60 minutes), we can divide that number by 4 to find out how many skips he can do in 15 minutes (since 60 minutes / 4 = 15 minutes). 4,200 skips/hour ÷ 4 = 1,050 skips in 15 minutes. Now, we know that together they can do 2,250 skips in 15 minutes. If Roberto does 1,050 of those, we can subtract that number from the total to find out how many Valerie does in 15 minutes. 2,250 total skips - 1,050 Roberto's skips = 1,200 Valerie's skips in 15 minutes.

Let (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{varphi(n)}) be all integers from 1 to (n-1) that are coprime with (n). 2. Consider the set of numbers obtained by multiplying (a) with each (a_i): [ a times a_1, a times a_2, ldots, a times a_{varphi(n)} ] 3. Each ( a times a_i ) is also coprime with (n). To see why, note that if (a) and (a_i) are coprime with (n), then ( gcd(a times a_i, n) = 1). 4. Therefore, each of these products (a a_i) when taken modulo (n) must result in a number that is coprime with (n). Hence, (a a_1, a a_2, ldots, a a_{varphi(n)}) modulo (n) are also one of (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{varphi(n)}). 5. Next, consider the product: [ a_1 a_2 cdots a_{varphi(n)} ] On one hand, we have: [ a a_1, a a_2, ldots, a a_{varphi(n)} ] When taken modulo (n) is just a permutation of (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{varphi(n)}). 6.

Because the sets are permutations of each other: [ a^{varphi(n)} times (a_1 a_2 cdots a_{varphi(n)}) = (a_1 a_2 cdots a_{varphi(n)}) pmod{n} ] 8. Since (a_1 a_2 cdots a_{varphi(n)}) is a product of numbers coprime to (n), it is itself coprime to (n), and consequently invertible modulo (n). 9.

Considering simultaneous meetings, we have the following possible pairs: (AB, CD), (AC, BD), (AD, CE), (AE, BC) as well as (AB, CE), (AC, BD), (AD, BC), (AE, CD). There are two sets, each with four pairs that can meet at the same time. With these conditions, we can permute the four pairs from each set for the chosen half-day sessions. The formula for permutations of selecting r items from n items where order matters is given by P(n, r) = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}. Since we are permuting four pairs from a set of four pairs, the required permutation is P(4, 4) = A_4^4 = frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = 4! = 24.

Clearly, 0 < a < 1 and 0 < b < 1 because x, y, z are positive and add up to 1. Substituting a and b into the equation we get: frac{b}{a} + frac{1}{1 - b} = 10 which simplifies to: a = frac{b - b^2}{9 - 10b} Hence, xyz = xy(1 - (x + y)) = a(1 - b) = frac{b(1 - b)^2}{9 - 10b}. To find the maximum value, we consider f(b) as follows: f(b) = frac{b(1 - b)^2}{9 - 10b} We can find its maximum value by finding where its derivative f'(b) equals zero. The derivative is: f'(b) = frac{-20b^3 + 47b^2 - 36b + 9}{(9 - 10b)^2} Setting f'(b) = 0 results in the cubic equation: -20b^3 + 47b^2 - 36b + 9 = 0 Factoring this, we get: (4b - 3)(5b - 3)(1 - b) = 0 which yields b = frac{3}{5}, b = frac{3}{4}, or b = 1 (but b = 1 is discarded because a and b are both less than 1). Analyzing f'(b) within the domains 0 < b < frac{3}{5}, frac{3}{5} < b < frac{3}{4}, and frac{3}{4} < b < 1, we find that f(b) is increasing, decreasing, and increasing, respectively, in these intervals. Thus, f(b) achieves a maximum when b = frac{3}{5}, at which point f(b) = f(frac{3}{5}) = frac{4}{125}. Since f(1) = 0, the maximum value of f(b) is frac{4}{125}.

Subtracting: [ 4 (mathbf{a} - mathbf{c}) (mathbf{b} - mathbf{d}) = 0 ] [ (mathbf{a} - mathbf{c}) (mathbf{b} - mathbf{d}) = 0 ] Thus proving the diagonals are perpendicular.

Show that at least one of them must be prime.","completion":"To show that at least one of the 15 positive integers must be prime, we will use the following steps: 1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose none of the 15 integers are prime. 2. **Prime factorization**: Each integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. 3. **Relatively prime condition**: Since the integers are relatively prime, no two integers share a common prime factor. 4. **Number of distinct primes**: If none of the integers are prime, each integer must be a product of at least two primes. 5. **Upper bound on primes**: We need to consider the number of distinct primes less than 1998. Let's go through these steps in detail: 1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose none of the 15 integers are prime. This means each integer is a composite number. 2. **Prime factorization**: Each composite number can be written as a product of prime numbers. For example, if ( n ) is a composite number, then ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are distinct primes and ( e_1, e_2, ldots, e_k ) are positive integers. 3. **Relatively prime condition**: Since the integers are relatively prime, no two integers share a common prime factor. This means that the prime factorizations of any two integers must be disjoint sets of primes. 4. **Number of distinct primes**: If none of the integers are prime, each integer must be a product of at least two primes. Since there are 15 integers and they are relatively prime, we need at least 15 distinct primes to form these integers. 5. **Upper bound on primes**: We need to consider the number of distinct primes less than 1998. The number of primes less than 1998 is given by the prime-counting function ( pi(1998) ). Using the approximation ( pi(x) approx frac{x}{ln(x)} ), we get: [ pi(1998) approx frac{1998}{ln(1998)} approx frac{1998}{7.6} approx 263 ] Therefore, there are approximately 263 primes less than 1998. Since we need at least 15 distinct primes to form the 15 relatively prime integers, and there are more than enough primes available, it is possible to construct such a set of integers. However, the key point is that if we assume none of the integers are prime, we would need to use at least 15 distinct primes to form the composite numbers. This contradicts the assumption that none of the integers are prime because it would be impossible to form 15 relatively prime composite numbers without using at least one prime number. Therefore, our initial assumption that none of the integers are prime must be false. Hence, at least one of the 15 integers must be prime.

The GCD will give us the largest dimension of the square tile that can be used without needing to cut any tiles. The length of the courtyard is 3.78 meters and the width is 5.95 meters. To find the GCD, we first need to express these measurements in the same unit without decimals. Since we are dealing with meters, we can convert the measurements to centimeters to eliminate the decimals. 3.78 meters = 378 centimeters 5.95 meters = 595 centimeters Now, we find the GCD of 378 and 595. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD: 1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder. 2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from step 1. 3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The non-zero remainder just before this is the GCD. Let's do the calculation: 595 ÷ 378 = 1 with a remainder of 217 378 ÷ 217 = 1 with a remainder of 161 217 ÷ 161 = 1 with a remainder of 56 161 ÷ 56 = 2 with a remainder of 49 56 ÷ 49 = 1 with a remainder of 7 49 ÷ 7 = 7 with a remainder of 0 The last non-zero remainder is 7, so the GCD of 378 and 595 is 7 centimeters.

This property arises because the distances from an incentre of a triangle to the points of tangency with the sides are equal. 3. **Application of Problem 53:** According to Problem 53, the length of the tangent from any point on the segment to the inscribed circle in the segment ( BAC ) is ( BW ).

We need to find a subset such that no element can be divided by another integer within the subset. 3. Let us consider the subset ( S ) consisting of the odd numbers starting from 1/3 of the original set: [ S = {2n + 1 mid 33 leqslant n leqslant 99} ] 4. From this, we have: [ S = {67, 69, 71, dots, 199} ] The total number of elements in ( S ) is: [ 99 - 33 + 1 = 67 ] 5. Now, we claim that ( S ) satisfies the condition that no element in ( S ) divides any other element in ( S ): - Consider any two elements ( a, b in S ) such that ( a leq b ). - Since both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd numbers, their quotient ( frac{b}{a} ) must also be an odd number. - If ( a mid b ), then ( frac{b}{a} ) must be an integer, and since any quotient of ( b/a geq 3 ), we have: [ frac{b}{a} geq 3 Rightarrow b geq 3a ] 6.

Consider subsets defined by the divisor property: [ T_{m} = { k mid k = 3^r m, (m, 3) = 1, k in M } ] Here, ( 1 leq m leq 199 ), ( m ) is coprime to 3, and ( m ) is odd, resulting in 67 possible values for ( m ). 8. By the pigeonhole principle for any subset containing more than 67 elements, at least two elements will belong to the same set ( T_{m_0} ). In such a pair, one element must divide the other, violating the given condition. 9. Hence, no subset larger than 67 elements can satisfy the condition that no number in the subset divides another. # Conclusion: The largest subset of the first 100 odd numbers ( M ) such that no element in the subset divides another is of size 67.

Is it possible for there to be exactly 7 lattice points inside the square?","completion":"In the given problem, we need to determine whether it is possible for exactly 7 lattice points to lie inside a square that is oriented at a 45-degree angle with the coordinate axes. We start by applying a specific transformation to the coordinate plane. 1. **Transformation**: - Apply a transformation that is a rotation by ( 45^circ ) and scaling by ( sqrt{2} ) centered at the origin. Under such a transformation, the lattice points (original grid points) are mapped to new grid points (let’s call them \\"white lattice points\\" when colored like a checkerboard and the origin considered white). The square becomes axis-aligned after this transformation. 2. **Rephrased Problem**: - This transformation simplifies our problem to finding out if a square aligned with the coordinate axes can contain exactly ( 7 ) white lattice points. 3. **Characterization of a Rectangle Inside a Square**: - For a rectangle inside our transformed square, we need to consider configurations where lattice points arrange themselves in a rectangular grid fashion. **Case 1: One side of the rectangle is even** - Consider the rectangle dimensions to be ( 2k times l ). The number of white lattice points in such an arrangement would be ( k times l ). - If ( k times l = 7 ): - The possible configurations are ( 14 times 1 ) or ( 7 times 2 ). - For ( 14 times 1 ) in an axis-aligned square: - The side lengths ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( 14 < a leq 16 ) and ( 0 < b leq 2 ). Clearly, ( a neq b ), so the grid cannot form a square. - Similarly, ( 7 times 2 ) configuration also fails to form a square. **Case 2: Both sides are odd** - Consider a rectangle of dimensions ((2k+1) times (2l+1)). The number of lattice points in this area becomes ( (2k+1)(2l+1) ). - If we need exactly ( 7 ) white lattice points: - Possible ( (2k+1)(2l+1) ) values are 13 or 15, and thus, configurations are ( 1 times 13 ), ( 1 times 15 ), or ( 3 times 5 ). - Similarly, these configurations fail to produce a square that fits our conditions. 4. **Conclusion**: - Based on the above analysis, it is not possible to have exactly 7 lattice points inside a square oriented at an angle of ( 45^circ ) with respect to the coordinate axes. Thus, the answer to the problem is: [ boxed{text{No, it is not possible.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let a,b,c be a triple of integers , which are triangle sides , and do not have a common divisor greater than 1 , for wich all three frac{a^2+b^2c^2}{a+bc} ,frac{b^2+c^2a^2}{b+ca} ,frac{c^2+a^2b^2}{c+ab} are integers. Prove that the product of the three denominators or it's double is a perfect square . *Proposed by Jaromír Šimiša*","completion":"To prove that the product of the three denominators or its double is a perfect square, we start by expressing the sides of the triangle in terms of new variables. Let ( a, b, c ) be the sides of the triangle, and assume they can be written as: [ 2a = x + y, quad 2b = x + z, quad 2c = y + z ] where ( x, y, z ) are integers with the same parity. 1. **Express the given fractions in terms of ( x, y, z ):** [ frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{a + b - c} = frac{(x+y)^2 + (x+z)^2 - (y+z)^2}{2((x+y) + (x+z) - (y+z))} ] Simplifying the numerator: [ (x+y)^2 + (x+z)^2 - (y+z)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 + 2xz + z^2 - y^2 - 2yz - z^2 = 2x^2 + 2xy + 2xz - 2yz ] Simplifying the denominator: [ 2((x+y) + (x+z) - (y+z)) = 2(2x) = 4x ] Thus, the fraction becomes: [ frac{2x^2 + 2xy + 2xz - 2yz}{4x} = frac{x^2 + xy + xz - yz}{2x} ] For this to be an integer, ( 2x ) must divide ( x^2 + xy + xz - yz ). Therefore: [ 2x mid yz ] 2. **Repeat the process for the other two fractions:** [ frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{b + c - a} = frac{(x+z)^2 + (y+z)^2 - (x+y)^2}{2((x+z) + (y+z) - (x+y))} ] Simplifying the numerator: [ (x+z)^2 + (y+z)^2 - (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xz + z^2 + y^2 + 2yz + z^2 - x^2 - 2xy - y^2 = 2z^2 + 2xz + 2yz - 2xy ] Simplifying the denominator: [ 2((x+z) + (y+z) - (x+y)) = 2(2z) = 4z ] Thus, the fraction becomes: [ frac{2z^2 + 2xz + 2yz - 2xy}{4z} = frac{z^2 + xz + yz - xy}{2z} ] For this to be an integer, ( 2z ) must divide ( xy ). Therefore: [ 2z mid xy ] 3. **For the third fraction:** [ frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{c + a - b} = frac{(y+z)^2 + (x+y)^2 - (x+z)^2}{2((y+z) + (x+y) - (x+z))} ] Simplifying the numerator: [ (y+z)^2 + (x+y)^2 - (x+z)^2 = y^2 + 2yz + z^2 + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - x^2 - 2xz - z^2 = 2y^2 + 2yz + 2xy - 2xz ] Simplifying the denominator: [ 2((y+z) + (x+y) - (x+z)) = 2(2y) = 4y ] Thus, the fraction becomes: [ frac{2y^2 + 2yz + 2xy - 2xz}{4y} = frac{y^2 + yz + xy - xz}{2y} ] For this to be an integer, ( 2y ) must divide ( xz ). Therefore: [ 2y mid xz ] 4. **Combining the results:** From the above, we have: [ 2x mid yz, quad 2y mid xz, quad 2z mid xy ] This implies that ( x, y, z ) must be such that the product ( xyz ) is divisible by ( 2x, 2y, ) and ( 2z ). 5. **Prime factorization and parity:** Let ( p ) be a prime number greater than 2. If ( p ) divides ( x ) and ( y ), then ( p ) must also divide ( z ) to satisfy the conditions. This would imply ( p ) divides ( 2a, 2b, ) and ( 2c ), leading to a contradiction since ( a, b, c ) are coprime. Therefore, for every prime ( p > 2 ), the exponents in the prime factorization of ( xyz ) must be even. 6. **Conclusion:** Since ( xyz ) is divisible by ( 2x, 2y, ) and ( 2z ), and the exponents of all primes greater than 2 in the factorization of ( xyz ) are even, it follows that ( (a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b) ) or its double is a perfect square.

For ( N = 2^q 5^r ): [ S(kN) = Sleft(10^{r+q}right) = 1 ] So, [ frac{S(kN)}{S(N)} = c_k ] This implies that for any ( N ): [ S(N) = Sleft(10^{r+q}Nright) leq Sleft(2^q 5^rright) S(kN) = frac{S(kN)}{c_k} ] Hence, [ frac{S(kN)}{S(N)} geq c_k ] 2. To demonstrate that any number ( Q ) which is co-prime with 10 ( ( Q > 1 ) ) can make the ratio ( frac{S(kN)}{S(N)} ) less than any given ( epsilon > 0 ): According to the solutions, such ( k ) numbers can be of the form ( k = 2^r 5^q Q ). Observing specific cases using comments from problem 73597, it is found that divisors of numbers of the form ( 10^m - 1 ), consisting of ( m ) nines, can be ( R_n ). So as ( n ) increases, the sum of digits of ( R_n ) can be made arbitrarily large, making: [ S(Q) leq epsilon S(R) ] This implies: [ frac{S(kN)}{S(N)} = frac{Sleft((R_n + 1) 2^r 5^q Qright)}{S(R_n + 1)} leq frac{S(2^r 5^q) S(Q)}{(n-1) S(R)} < epsilon ] Conclusion for Part (b): So, the required value exists only for ( k = 2^r 5^q ), with: [ c_k = frac{1}{S(2^q 5^r)} ] Thus, the largest suitable value of ( c' ) for this problem is concluded. boxed{ text{Only for } k = 2^r 5^q, text{ where } c_k = frac{1}{S(2^q 5^r)} }"},{"prompt":"The table below gives the percent of students in each grade at Maple and Oak elementary schools: [ begin{tabular}{rccccccc} & textbf{underline{K}} & textbf{underline{1}} & textbf{underline{2}} & textbf{underline{3}} & textbf{underline{4}} & textbf{underline{5}} & textbf{underline{6}} textbf{Maple:} & 10% & 20% & 18% & 15% & 12% & 15% & 10% textbf{Oak:} & 15% & 14% & 13% & 16% & 12% & 15% & 15% end{tabular} ] Maple has 150 students and Oak has 250 students.

The calculation is based on the difference from the standard weight and the number of baskets for each difference. - For the difference of -2.5 kg, with 2 baskets: -2.5 times 2 = -5 kg - For the difference of -2 kg, with 4 baskets: -2 times 4 = -8 kg - For the difference of -0.5 kg, with 2 baskets: -0.5 times 2 = -1 kg - For the difference of 0 kg, with 1 basket: 0 times 1 = 0 kg - For the difference of 1 kg, with 3 baskets: 1 times 3 = 3 kg - For the difference of 1.5 kg, with 8 baskets: 1.5 times 8 = 12 kg Adding all these values together gives us the total over or underweight: -5 + (-8) + (-1) + 0 + 3 + 12 = 1text{ kg} Therefore, compared to the standard weight, the 20 baskets of tomatoes are a total of 1 kilogram overweight. boxed{1text{ kg}} Part 2: Calculating the Total Sale Price Next, we calculate how much these 20 baskets of tomatoes can be sold for.

Considering the odd divisors first, the number when divided by the highest power of 2 should have 8 divisors. The configurations for 8 divisors can be 8 = 2 cdot 4 (implying either one prime to the seventh power or two primes with one being cubed). - Smallest prime to the seventh power is 3^7 = 2187. - Smallest combination of two primes, one being cubed, is 3^3 cdot 5 = 135. 3.

This can be proven as follows: - AL bisects DE while AG bisects BC. - AL and AG are isogonal conjugates, so DE and BC are antiparallel in angle A. 6. **Homothety Transformation**: Consider a homothety centered at L with a scale factor of 2. This homothety sends DE to a line through A. Since DE is antiparallel to BC, the image of DE under this homothety is the tangent to (ABC) at A. 7. **Image of triangle XYZ**: Under the homothety centered at L with a scale factor of 2, the image of triangle XYZ is a triangle whose sides are tangents to (ABC).

So we have: x / (n * p) = odd prime number Given that x = 72, we can substitute this into the equation: 72 / (n * p) = odd prime number Since 72 is not a prime number, it must be divided by n * p to yield an odd prime number. The prime factorization of 72 is: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2 To get an odd number, we must eliminate all factors of 2 from 72. This leaves us with: 3^2 = 9 So, the odd prime number must be a factor of 9. The only odd prime factor of 9 is 3 itself (since 9 = 3^2 and 3 is prime). Therefore, we have: 72 / (n * p) = 3 Now we can solve for n * p: n * p = 72 / 3 n * p = 24 Since p is a prime number and must divide 24, the possible values for p are the prime factors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is: 24 = 2^3 * 3 The prime factors are 2 and 3. Since we are looking for the least value of x, which is already given as 72, we want the smallest possible value for n * p that will yield the odd prime number 3 when 72 is divided by it. The smallest prime factor of 24 is 2, but using 2 would not yield an odd number after division. Therefore, we must use the next smallest prime factor, which is 3. So, let's choose p = 3.

When point P is at the vertex of the minor axis, the distance from P to F_1F_2 is the largest, so at this time, the area of triangle PF_1F_2 is the largest, thus S_{triangle PF_1F_2} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2c cdot b = 2, so b = sqrt{2}.

Substituting these into the function, we get: f(alpha)= frac {sin alpha cos alpha tan alpha}{(-tan alpha)(-sin alpha)} Cancelling out the common factors -sin alpha, we get: f(alpha)= frac {cos alpha tan alpha}{tan alpha} Cancelling out the common factor tan alpha, we get: f(alpha)= cos alpha (2) Now, we substitute alpha=-frac {31pi}{3} into the simplified function: f(-frac {31pi}{3})= cos (-frac {31pi}{3}) Since cosine is an even function (i.e., cos(-theta) = cos(theta)), we can rewrite this as: f(-frac {31pi}{3})= cos (frac {31pi}{3}) Now, we can simplify the angle by subtracting multiples of 2pi until we get an angle within the range [0, 2pi): frac {31pi}{3} - 16pi = frac {pi}{3} So, we have: f(-frac {31pi}{3})= cos (frac {pi}{3}) And since cos (frac {pi}{3}) = frac {1}{2}, we get: boxed{f(-frac {31pi}{3})= -frac {1}{2}}"},{"prompt":"Let ( O ) be the center of a circle ( C ) and ( P_0 ) a point on the circle.

The area of triangle ABC is given as 3. We need to determine angle A. To solve this problem, we start by considering the geometric properties and relationships in triangle ABC. 1. **Identify Midpoint and Perpendicular Drop:** Since D is the midpoint of AC, we can draw BE perpendicular to AC at point E. Let BE = x and AE = y. Given the point D as the midpoint of AC splits segment AC into two equal parts. Furthermore, since BD = BC, triangle BDC is an isosceles triangle, and angle BDC = angle BCD causing D to lie on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since B, E, and C form a right triangle and AB = 3, we use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABE: [ x^2 + y^2 = 9 ] 3. **Calculating the Area:** The area of triangle ABC can also be expressed using its geometric components. The area can be expressed as: [ S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} times AC times BE ] Given D is the midpoint of AC, we know AC = 2y because D splits it into two equal segments AD and DC of length y. Substituting BE = x into the area formula, we have: [ S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2y cdot x = y cdot x ] Using the given area, the above equation should equal 3: [ y cdot x = 3 ] 4. **Solving Equations:** We now have two key equations: [ x^2 + y^2 = 9 qquad text{(1)} ] [ x cdot y = 3 qquad text{(2)} ] Solving these equations together involves substituting ( y = frac{3}{x} ) from equation (2) into equation (1): [ x^2 + left(frac{3}{x}right)^2 = 9 ] Simplifying: [ x^2 + frac{9}{x^2} = 9 ] Multiply through by x^2: [ x^4 + 9 = 9x^2 ] Rearrang to form a polynomial: [ x^4 - 9x^2 + 9 = 0 ] Letting z = x^2, the quadratic becomes: [ z^2 - 9z + 9 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( z = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ): [ z = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 - 36}}{2} = frac{9 pm sqrt{45}}{2} = frac{9 pm 3sqrt{5}}{2} ] Since ( z = x^2 ), only the positive root applies: [ z = frac{9 + 3sqrt{5}}{2} quad Rightarrow x^2 = z = frac{9}{2} + frac{3sqrt{5}}{2} ] Solving for x and y gives: [ x = y = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} ] 5. **Finding angle A:** Note that since x = y = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} in triangle ABC and angle ABE = theta is such to satisfy: [ tan(theta) = frac{x}{y} = frac{y}{y} = 1 ] Thus, [ theta = frac{pi}{4} ] Therefore, angle A = frac{pi}{4}. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{pi}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( g ) be a graph with ( n ) vertices and ( m ) edges that contains no 4cycles.

A \\"bend\\" is a specific configuration defined as a pair ({a, c}, b) where vertex a is connected to vertex b and vertex b is connected to vertex c. This definition can be rephrased as counting the number of paths of length 2. 3. Let C be the total number of such bends in the graph. We can express C as follows: [ C = sum_{a in V(G)} binom{d(a)}{2} ] Here, d(a) denotes the degree of vertex a, and binom{d(a)}{2} counts the number of pairs of neighbors of vertex a. 4. Since the graph contains no 4-cycles, any two neighbors of a vertex b cannot be themselves neighbors, otherwise, they would form a 4-cycle with b. Therefore, the expression for C is at most the number of pairs of edges in the graph, bounded above by the number of ways to choose 2 edges from m, which is: [ C leq binom{n}{2} ] Simplifying the binomial coefficient: [ C leq frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] 5. We use Jensen's inequality applied to the convex function f(x) = binom{x}{2} = frac{x(x-1)}{2}. Jensen's inequality for a convex function states: [ fleft(frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^n x_iright) leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) ] 6.

Assume boldsymbol{e}_i = left(sin varphi_i, cos varphi_iright) such that cos varphi_1 = 1 and sin varphi_1 = 0.

We will consider if it is possible for these five players to satisfy the given conditions. 3. **Analyzing the total number of ordered triples** The total number of ordered triples of distinct players among these five is: [ 5 times 4 times 3 = 60. ] Each triple must satisfy exactly one of the three conditions given in the problem. 4. **Characteristics of the relations** Each relation in which (A) takes lessons from (B) (denoted (A rightarrow B)) involves three players. Each relation among (A, B,) and (C) (denoted as (A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow A)) represents a cyclic relation. 5. **Counting pairs contributing to triples** By the problem's conditions, each directed pair ((A rightarrow B)) contributes to exactly three triples ((A, B, C)), ((B, C, A)), and ((C, A, B)). This is because (C) can be any of the other players distinct from (A) and (B). 6. **Total number of potential lesson pairs** Let’s count the total number of possible lesson-taking pairs: [ text{Total number of ordered triples} = 60, text{So, number of pairs } = frac{60}{3} = 20. ] But this calculation is incorrect because each pair (involving two players) recurs in relation three times. Correctly, each unique directed pair (say (A rightarrow B)) appears in (3) triples, total ordered triples ((3k)) divided by possible distinct pairs: [ frac{60}{9} = 6.67, ] which is not an integer, so it confirms that not all conditions can be satisfied for five players. 7. **Considering four players** Next, we check if it is possible with four distinct players: (P, Q, R,) and (S).

Each dancing pair is unique. - We need to determine the maximum number of different dance counts they could report to their parents. 1. **Setting the Context:** - Let ( B ) be the set of boys and ( G ) be the set of girls. - Total members: ( 29 ) boys + ( 15 ) girls = 44 individuals. - Each individual reports a number indicating the number of dances they participated in. 2. **Finding the Maximum and Minimum Dance Counts:** - The maximum dance count for any individual is given by a situation where one girl dances with all boys. This maximum number is 29. - Conversely, the minimum dance count is 0, as at least one girl might not have danced with any boy. 3. **Possible Range of Dance Counts:** - Thus, the possible dance counts for reporting range from 0 to 29. - If every number from 0 to 29 were to be reported, this would count to 30 different numbers. 4. **Proof by Contradiction that 30 Different Numbers is Impossible:** - Assume the contrary that all 30 numbers (from 0 to 29) were indeed reported. - This would mean all counts from 16 to 29 must be reported by girls as there are only 15 girls. This leaves 15 numbers (0 included). - Clearly, there is one girl who reported 0 dances; thus she hasn't danced with any boy. Hence no boys can report dancing 15 times, contradicting the initial assumption. 5. **Verifying 29 Different Numbers is Achievable:** - Assign a numbering system: - Number girls from 1 to 15. - Number boys from 1 to 29. - Pairing logic: - Boy ( i ) dances with Girl ( j ) if ( i geq j ). - Girl 1 would then dance with boys 1 through 29 and record 1 dance. - Girl 2 would dance with boys 2 through 29, recording 2 dances, and so on until: - Girl 15 dances with 15 boys, recording 15 dances. - For boys: - Boy 1 would dance with 1 girl, logging 1 dance. - Boy 2 dances with 2 girls, logging 2 dances, and so forth. - This setup would ensure dance counts from 1 to 15 for boys and 15 for girls can vary and fill all numbers from 0 up to 29. **Conclusion:** Given the structure of the problem and logical pairings for optimized reporting of dance counts, it's evident that achieving a count of 29 different numbers is possible and the upper limit.

This is derived from understanding that the symmetry of f(x-1) as an even function implies symmetry about the vertical axis, which translates to a specific form of symmetry for f(x) itself. 4. **Further deduction f(x) = -f(2-x):** Given the symmetry about (1,0), we can deduce that f(x) and f(2-x) are related in such a way that one is the negative of the other. This is a consequence of the symmetry about a point rather than about an axis. 5. **Combining the two symmetries:** By combining f(x) = f(-2-x) and f(x) = -f(2-x), we arrive at the conclusion that f(x+4) = -f(x). This step involves understanding how the two symmetries interact and affect the function. 6. **Periodicity of the function:** From f(x+4) = -f(x), we can deduce that applying this transformation twice, we get f(x+8) = f(x). This shows that the function has a periodicity of 8. 7. **Calculating f(2022):** Given the periodicity, we can find the equivalent point within one period to 2022, which is f(-2+253 times 8) = f(-2). Since f(x) = ax - 1, we can calculate f(-2) = a(-2) - 1 = -1, assuming we know f(0) = -1 from the given function form and the symmetry about (1,0).

To find the slope, we can use the property that the tangent line to point N must satisfy the implicit differentiation condition of the ellipse equation: [ 2(x-x_0) + frac{2y(y-y_0)}{b^2/a^2} = 0 ] Substituting x_0 = -1 and y_0 = 1 we have: [ 2(x+1) + frac{2y(y-1)}{3/4} = 0 ] Solving for y in terms of x provides the equation of the tangent line: [ y = frac{3}{4}x + 1 ] Rearranging into standard linear form, the equation is: [ boxed{3x - 4y + 7 = 0} ]"},{"prompt":"Several nonintersecting diagonals divide a convex polygon into triangles. At each vertex of the polygon the number of triangles adjacent to it is written. Is it possible to reconstruct all the diagonals using these numbers if the diagonals are erased?","completion":"1. **Base Case:** We start with the base case where ( n = 3 ). For a triangle, there are no diagonals, and the problem is trivial since there are no diagonals to reconstruct. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any convex polygon with ( k ) sides (where ( k leq n-1 )), the diagonals can be uniquely reconstructed given the number of triangles adjacent to each vertex. 3. **Inductive Step:** Consider a convex polygon with ( n ) sides. We need to show that the diagonals can be uniquely reconstructed given the number of triangles adjacent to each vertex. - **Smallest Diagonal:** Since the polygon is convex and the diagonals do not intersect, there must be a diagonal that divides the polygon into a triangle and a smaller polygon with ( n-1 ) sides. This diagonal will be the smallest diagonal in terms of the number of sides it divides. - **Vertex with Number 1:** There must be a vertex in the polygon that is adjacent to exactly one triangle. This vertex will have the number 1 assigned to it. This is because the smallest diagonal will create a triangle that includes this vertex. - **Drawing the Smallest Diagonal:** Identify the vertex with the number 1. Draw the diagonal that connects this vertex to another vertex such that it forms a triangle and leaves an ( (n-1) )-gon. This diagonal is the smallest diagonal that cuts out the vertex with number 1. - **Updating the Numbers:** After drawing this diagonal, decrease the number of triangles adjacent to the vertices connected by this diagonal by 1. This is because the newly formed triangle will no longer be adjacent to these vertices in the remaining ( (n-1) )-gon. - **Applying Inductive Hypothesis:** Now, we are left with an ( (n-1) )-gon. By the inductive hypothesis, the diagonals of this ( (n-1) )-gon can be uniquely reconstructed given the updated numbers of triangles adjacent to each vertex. 4. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for any convex polygon with ( n ) sides, the diagonals can be uniquely reconstructed given the number of triangles adjacent to each vertex.

The time it took Charles to drive the first half of the distance at 90 mph can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed For the first half: Time_1 = (D/2) / 90 For the second half, where he drove at 180 mph: Time_2 = (D/2) / 180 We know that the total time for the whole trip is 30 hours, so: Time_1 + Time_2 = 30 Substituting the expressions for Time_1 and Time_2, we get: (D/2) / 90 + (D/2) / 180 = 30 To solve for D, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 180 in this case: (2D/180) + (D/180) = 30 Combine the fractions: (3D/180) = 30 Multiply both sides by 180 to solve for D: 3D = 30 * 180 Divide both sides by 3: D = (30 * 180) / 3 D = 5400 / 3 D = 1800 miles So, Charles had to drive a total of boxed{1800} miles."},{"prompt":"The greatest number that divides a certain number and 875 leaving remainders 10 and 25 respectively is 170.

The sequences are defined recursively by: [ a_{n+1} = gcd(a_n, b_n) + 1, qquad b_{n+1} = operatorname{lcm}(a_n, b_n) - 1. ] We need to show that the sequence (a_n) is eventually periodic. 2. **Behavior of (a_{n+1}):** Note that (a_{n+1} = gcd(a_n, b_n) + 1). Since (gcd(a_n, b_n)) is a divisor of (a_n), it follows that: [ a_{n+1} - 1 mid a_n. ] This implies that (a_{n+1}) is either (a_n + 1) or (d + 1) for some divisor (d) of (a_n). 3. **Increasing Sequence Condition:** The sequence (a_n) increases by 1 if and only if (a_n mid b_n). Otherwise, (a_{n+1} = d + 1) for some divisor (d) of (a_n). 4. **Definition of Peaks:** Define (i) to be a *peak* if (a_i nmid b_i), i.e., (a_i geq a_{i+1}). Note that at least one non-peak exists since otherwise the sequence would always be decreasing or constant. 5. **Non-Increasing Sequence of Peaks:** We claim that the (a)-values of the peaks form a non-increasing sequence. Suppose (n) is a non-peak and let (n + m) be the minimal peak greater than (n). Then for each (n' = n, n+1, ldots, n+m-1), we have (a_{n'} mid b_{n'}), so: [ a_{n'+1} = a_{n'} + 1 quad text{and} quad b_{n'+1} = b_{n'} - 1. ] Let (b_n = k a_n). Then: [ (a_n, b_n) = (a_n, k a_n), ] [ (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (a_n + 1, k a_n - 1), ] [ (a_{n+2}, b_{n+2}) = (a_n + 2, k a_n - 2), ] [ vdots ] [ (a_{n+m}, b_{n+m}) = (a_n + m, k a_n - m). ] 6. **GCD and LCM Calculation:** Let (d = gcd(a_n + m, k a_n - m)). Then: [ a_{n+m+1} = d + 1 quad text{and} quad b_{n+m+1} = frac{(a_n + m)(k a_n - m)}{d} - 1. ] Since (n + m) is a peak, (a_n + m nmid k a_n - m), so (d < a_n + m). 7. **Contradiction for Subsequent Peaks:** Suppose the subsequent peak after (n + m) has an (a)-value greater than (a_n + m). Then: [ (a_{n+m+1}, b_{n+m+1}) = left( d + 1, frac{(a_n + m)(k a_n - m)}{d} - 1 right), ] [ vdots ] [ (a_x, b_x) = left( a_n + m, frac{(a_n + m)(k a_n - m)}{d} - (a_n + m - d) right) ] for some (x). Since we assumed (x) is not a peak, (a_x mid b_x). So: [ a_n + m mid frac{(a_n + m)(k a_n - m)}{d} - (a_n + m - d) implies a_n + m mid d. ] Since (d mid k a_n - m), combining the above with (d mid a_n + m), we have (d = a_n + m). This contradicts (d < a_n + m). 8. **Bounded Sequence:** The key is to note that (gcd(a_n, b_n) = gcd(a_n, b_n + N)), where (N = (a_m)!), where (a_m = max(a_i)), which exists since the (a)-sequence is bounded. Also, (b_{n+1} = frac{a_n}{a_{n+1} - 1} b_n - 1), so (b_{n+1} mod N) can be determined from (a_n, a_{n+1}), and (b_n mod N). Hence, ((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1} mod N)) is determined by ((a_n, b_n mod N)). 9. **Pigeonhole Principle:** Since there are finitely many possibilities for (a_i) and for (b_i mod N), the (a)-sequence is eventually periodic by the Pigeonhole Principle.

Therefore, b+c = 2(sin B + sin C) = 2sin B + 2sinleft(frac{2pi}{3} - Bright) = 2sqrt{3}sinleft(B + frac{pi}{6}right) Since C = frac{2pi}{3} - B in (0, frac{pi}{2}) and B in (0, frac{pi}{2}), we have frac{pi}{6} < B < frac{pi}{2}, which implies: frac{pi}{3} < B + frac{pi}{6} < frac{2pi}{3} Therefore, the range for sin(B + frac{pi}{6}) is frac{sqrt{3}}{2} < sin(B + frac{pi}{6}) leqslant 1.

Together, Bill and Julia ran a total of 36 miles over the weekend. First, we need to find out how many miles Bill ran on Saturday. Since he ran 4 more miles on Sunday than on Saturday, and he ran 10 miles on Sunday, he must have run 10 - 4 = 6 miles on Saturday. Now we know that Bill ran a total of 6 miles on Saturday and 10 miles on Sunday, which adds up to 6 + 10 = 16 miles for the entire weekend. Since Bill and Julia ran a total of 36 miles together, we can find out how many miles Julia ran by subtracting the miles Bill ran from the total. So, Julia ran 36 - 16 = 20 miles on Sunday (since she did not run on Saturday). Now we need to find the ratio of the miles Julia ran on Sunday to the miles Bill ran on Sunday. Julia ran 20 miles, and Bill ran 10 miles. The ratio is 20 (Julia's miles) : 10 (Bill's miles), which simplifies to 2:1.

The goal is to balance the milk distribution such that each jug contains an equal amount of milk, and our goal is to achieve this in no more than 10 steps. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define Initial Conditions**: - Let the amount of milk in each jug ( (i=1, 2, ..., 10) ) be represented as ( m_i ), where ( m_i leq 0.10 ) (10% of the jug's capacity). 2. **Operation Details**: - In each operation, choose one jug ((m_i)) and redistribute ( frac{1}{10} ) of its current milk content evenly into the other 9 jugs. Let's denote the amount of milk in the chosen jug after redistribution as ( m'_i ) for clarity. 3. **Redistribution Formula**: - For the chosen jug (m_i ), we redistribute: [ frac{m_i}{10} ] to each of the other 9 jugs. This means subtracting (frac{9m_i}{10}) from (m_i). - Algebraically: [ m_i' = m_i - 9 cdot frac{m_i}{10} = m_i - frac{9m_i}{10} = frac{m_i}{10} ] Additionally, each of the other 9 jugs receives: [ frac{m_i}{10} ] from (m_i). 4. **Mathematical Analysis**: - After the redistribution, the amount of milk in each jug (j) ( (j neq i) ), changes from (m_j) to: [ m_j' = m_j + frac{m_i}{10} ] 5. **Effect on Each Jug**: - Therefore, after one operation, the total amount of milk is still conserved but more evenly spread across all jugs. This process incrementally reduces discrepancies among milk amounts in all jugs: 6. **Iterate Over Jugs**: - If we repeat this operation on each of the 10 jugs, at each step redistributing ( frac{1}{10} ) of their content to the rest, the differences in the milk amounts between any two jugs decrease step by step. 7. **Convergence to Equal Distribution**: - Mathematically, after 10 such iterations, such redistributions ensure that the milk will be evenly distributed across all 10 jugs. - Note: By balancing the milk in one jug completely and redistributing it, this approximates an averaging out process where differences are minimized step-by-step. 8. **Conclusion**: - Given that the maximum initial milk amount per jug is (leq 0.10), after each jug has been subject to redistribution, the cumulative effect converges the milk levels in all jugs towards equality. Thus, in no more than 10 operations, the milk can be equally distributed across all jugs.

Next, we need to find the radius (r) of the inscribed circle in triangle LMN.

Verification using geometric properties and constructed points: Let (O) be the center and (r) the radius of the circle inscribed in ( triangle LMN ), touching the sides at points (C), (D), and (E).

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Given Information**: We are given that overrightarrow{PF_{1}}cdot overrightarrow{PF_{2}}=0. This implies that the vectors overrightarrow{PF_{1}} and overrightarrow{PF_{2}} are perpendicular to each other, which means angle F_{1}PF_{2}=frac{pi}{2}. 2. **Ellipse Equation**: The equation of the ellipse is given by frac{x^2}{5}+y^{2}=1. From this, we can deduce the semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b. For an ellipse of the form frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, we have a^2=5 and b^2=1. Therefore, a=sqrt{5} and b=1. 3. **Foci Distance**: The distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus, denoted as c, can be found using the formula c^2=a^2-b^2. Substituting the values of a and b, we get c^2=5-1=4, so c=2. 4. **Perimeter Sum**: For any point P on the ellipse, the sum of the distances from P to the foci F_{1} and F_{2} is constant and equal to 2a. Therefore, |PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|=2sqrt{5}. 5. **Using Pythagoras Theorem**: Since angle F_{1}PF_{2}=frac{pi}{2}, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangle PF_{1}F_{2}. This gives us |PF_{1}|^{2}+|PF_{2}|^{2}=(2c)^{2}=16. 6. **Finding the Product**: To find |PF_{1}|cdot |PF_{2}|, we use the fact that (|PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|)^2 = |PF_{1}|^2 + 2|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}| + |PF_{2}|^2. We know (|PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|)^2 = (2sqrt{5})^2 = 20 and |PF_{1}|^2 + |PF_{2}|^2 = 16. Substituting these values, we get 20 = 16 + 2|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}|, which simplifies to 2|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}| = 4.

Finally, we calculate the sine of the angle between the line l and the plane alpha. 1. **Finding Normal Vectors:** Given the equation of the plane alpha as x+2y-2z+1=0, the normal vector of the plane alpha is overrightarrow{n}=(1, 2, -2). The normal vector of the plane x-y+3=0 is overrightarrow{m}_{1}=(1, -1, 0), and the normal vector of the plane x-2z-1=0 is overrightarrow{m}_{2}=(1, 0, -2). 2. **Finding the Direction Vector of Line l:** The direction vector of the line l, denoted as overrightarrow{m}, is perpendicular to both overrightarrow{m}_{1} and overrightarrow{m}_{2}.

(ii) There is a point of (mathcal{A}) in any triangle whose vertices are in (mathcal{B}), and there is a point of (mathcal{B}) in any triangle whose vertices are in (mathcal{A}).","completion":"We need to determine whether there exist two disjoint infinite sets mathcal{A} and mathcal{B} of points in the plane that satisfy the following conditions: 1. No three points in mathcal{A} cup mathcal{B} are collinear, and the distance between any two points in mathcal{A} cup mathcal{B} is at least 1. 2. There is a point of mathcal{A} in any triangle whose vertices are in mathcal{B}, and there is a point of mathcal{B} in any triangle whose vertices are in mathcal{A}. Let's analyze these conditions step-by-step. 1. **Selecting Points and Initial Observation:** Suppose such sets mathcal{A} and mathcal{B} do exist. Choose any point A in mathcal{A}. Since the distance between any two points in mathcal{A} is at least 1, for any radius r, the number of points in mathcal{A} within distance r from A is finite. Choose four points B, C, D, E in mathcal{A} that are closest to A. Consider the convex hull mathcal{C} formed by the points A, B, C, D, E. 2. **Analyzing the Convex Hull:** There are three cases to consider based on the shape of the convex hull mathcal{C}: - **Case 1: mathcal{C} is a pentagon.** - Say mathcal{C} = ABCDE. The convex hull does not contain any other point of mathcal{A} by construction. - By condition (ii), each triangle within this pentagon (e.g., triangle ABC, triangle ACD, triangle ADE) must contain a point of mathcal{B}. Let these points be P, Q, R respectively. - The triangle triangle PQR must, in turn, contain a point F in mathcal{A} inside mathcal{C}, which contradicts our initial assumption that no point of mathcal{A} is inside mathcal{C}. Thus, no such pentagon can exist. - **Case 2: mathcal{C} is a quadrilateral with E inside.** - Assume mathcal{C} = ABCD and point E lies within ABCD. - By condition (ii), the triangles ABE, BCE, CDE, and DAE must contain points of mathcal{B}, say P, Q, R, S respectively. These points P, Q, R, S form two disjoint triangles among themselves. - This implies at least one of the points of mathcal{A} must lie inside mathcal{C} or the two triangles within mathcal{C} contain points of mathcal{B}, which leads to another contradiction. Therefore, no such quadrilateral can exist. - **Case 3: mathcal{C} is a triangle with two additional points inside.** - Say mathcal{C} = ABC with points D and \`E\` lying inside it. - The region inside mathcal{C} can be divided into five disjoint triangles with vertices in mathcal{A}. - By condition (ii), each of these triangles must contain at least one point of mathcal{B} inside them. So, there are at least five points of mathcal{B} inside mathcal{C}, forming at least three disjoint triangles containing three points of mathcal{A}, another contradiction. Therefore, a triangular convex hull is also impossible. 3. **Conclusion:** Since each possible geometric configuration of points leads to a contradiction, we can conclusively state that no such infinite disjoint sets mathcal{A} and mathcal{B} exist under the given conditions.

Let's represent (z) in the complex plane as (z = x + yi), where (x) and (y) are real numbers. 2. **Identifying Foci and Formulating Shapes:** The problem hints that we need to interpret these equations in the context of geometric shapes such as ellipses or hyperbolas with foci (F_1) and (F_2). Specifically: - Equation (1) suggests that the sum of distances to two points (foci) is constant, indicating an ellipse. - Equation (2) suggests that the difference of distances to two points (foci) is constant, indicating a hyperbola. 3. **Finding Foci Coordinates:** Let's denote the foci by (F_1(0, -n)) and (F_2(0, m)). For (F_1 = (0, -n)) and (F_2 = (0, m)): - Equation (1) tells us that: [ |z + ni| + |z - mi| = n ] This form corresponds to an ellipse where the distance from any point on the ellipse to the two foci adds up to a constant (n). 4. **Applying Inequalities:** To proceed, we use the properties of (n) and (m): - Since (n > 0), we can state: [ n = |z + ni| + |z - mi| geq |z - ni| ] which implies (m < 0). 5. **Evaluating the Shapes Further:** - Now, from Equation (2): [ |z + ni| - |z - mi| = -m ] Given (n > 0) and figuring that ( -m < n ): [ |z + ni| = k_1, quad |z - mi| = k_2 quad text{(distances to foci)} ] 6. **Comparing the Given Shapes:** Considering (F_1) and (F_2) and interpreting geometrically: - According to (k_2), points on one branch of a hyperbola are closer to (F_2). 7. **Conclusion:** By correctly interpreting the distances and the inequalities, the correct representation of (F_1) and (F_2) consistently fits the hyperbola scenario outlined in Option (B).

Since (a^2 < p^k), we have (d < frac{k}{2}). - Since (p^k mid a^2(a^2 - a + 2)), we have (v_p(a^2 - a + 2) geq k - 2d). - But (p^k nmid (a^2 - a + 2)), so (v_p(a^2 - a + 2) < frac{k}{2}). - Thus, (frac{k}{2} > k - 2d), which gives (4d > k > 0), hence (p mid a). 6. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: (p) is odd.** - If (p) is odd, then (p) cannot divide (a^2 - a + 2) unless (p) divides 2, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, (p = 2). - **Case 2: (p = 2).** - Since (gcd(a, a^2 - a + 2) = gcd(a, 2) leq 2), we have (min{nu_p(a), nu_p(a^2 - a + 2)} = 1). - **Subcase 1: (nu_p(a) = 1).** - So (a equiv 2 pmod{4}), which implies (4 mid a^2 - a + 2), hence (k > 2). - But (k < 4d = 4), so (k = 3). - We get (a^2 + b + 1 = 2^3 = 8), so (a = 2) and (b = 3). - However, in this case, (a^2 + b + 1 = 8) divides (16 = (2 + 3 - 1)^2), which contradicts the non-divisibility condition. - **Subcase 2: (nu_p(a^2 - a + 2) = 1).** - Since (p^k mid a^2(a^2 - a + 2)), we have (2d + 1 geq k), hence (d geq frac{k - 1}{2}). - But we also have (frac{k}{2} > d), hence we must have (d = frac{k - 1}{2}) where (k) is odd. - Let (k = 2n + 1). So (a = 2^n m) where (m) is odd. - Since (a^2 < 2^k), we get (2^{2n} m^2 < 2^{2n + 1}), so (m = 1). - So we get (a = 2^n), (b = 2^k - a^2 - 1 = 2^{2n + 1} - 2^{2n} - 1 = 2^{2n} - 1). - It is easy to check that ((2^n, 2^{2n} - 1)) satisfies the given conditions for all positive integers (n > 1) (for (n = 1) it's the same as case i).

A: 10 B: 9 C: 8 D: 1","completion":"Since y = f(x) has a period of 2, the graph of y = x^2 for x in [-1,1] will repeat for every interval of length 2. Thus, we can find out how many times this parabolic segment intersects with y = |lg x| in just one period and then determine the total number of intersections by considering all periods in the domain of y = |lg x|. First, let's consider the graph of y = x^2 on the interval [-1,1]. The function y = |lg x| is only defined for x > 0. Thus, we look at the intersection points on the interval [0,1] within the period [-1,1]. The function y = |lg x| is equivalent to y = lg x when x geq 1 and y = -lg x when 0 < x < 1. Since lg x decreases as x approaches 0 from the right, the graph of y = |lg x| will intersect the graph of y = x^2 exactly once in the interval (0,1), at some point x_0. Due to the periodicity of f(x), this segment of the parabola (y = x^2 in the interval [-1,1]) will repeat for every subsequent period. This means there will be an identical intersection in the interval (1,2] at the point x_0 + 1. As the function |lg x| is monotonically decreasing for x > 1, it doesn't intersect with any other parabolic segments outside of the interval (0,1) within the period. Finally, since y = |lg x| is defined for all positive x and as y = x^2 repeats itself for every interval of length 2, we conclude that for every period to the right of the y-axis and within the domain of |lg x|, there will be 1 intersection point. Thus, the intersection points are (x_0, x_0^2), (x_0 + 2, (x_0 + 2)^2), (x_0 + 4, (x_0 + 4)^2), and so on. Since the function |lg x| is only defined for positive x, we only consider the parabola repeating itself to the right of the y-axis. Now, note that the graph of |lg x| for x geq 10 is below y = 1, while the graph of f(x) is above y = 1 for x geq 1. This indicates that there will be no more intersections once the output of the logarithm hits 1. The last interval of f(x) that could intersect with |lg x| is when x is in the interval [9,10], as x^2 > 1 for any x > 1. Hence, there will be a total of 9 periods to consider: [0,1], [1,2], ..., [8,9]. In each interval, there's exactly one intersection. Therefore, the total number of intersections is: [ boxed{9} ]"},{"prompt":"Truant Vasya missed one lesson each Monday, two lessons each Tuesday, three lessons each Wednesday, four lessons each Thursday, and five lessons each Friday in every week of a certain September.

Therefore, we can serve 10 people and there will be some sweet potatoes left over.

The selection of these 5 numbers can be done in {11 choose 5} ways. The reasoning behind this is as follows: - We have 11 numbers left after fixing a_6=1. - We choose 5 of these to be in the first part of the sequence (a_1 through a_5) in descending order. - The remaining 6 numbers will automatically be in the second part of the sequence (a_7 through a_{12}) in ascending order. Therefore, the number of ways to select these 5 numbers from the 11 available is {11 choose 5}. This is equivalent to calculating the number of combinations of 11 items taken 5 at a time, which gives us: {11 choose 5} = frac{11!}{5!(11-5)!} = frac{11 times 10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 462.

This contradiction implies that: - The only way the equation can hold for real polynomials is if all involved polynomials are zero, i.e., ( f(x) = 0 ), ( g(x) = 0 ), and ( h(x) = 0 ). Therefore, we conclude that when ( f(x), g(x), h(x) ) are real polynomial functions: [ boxed{f(x) = g(x) = h(x) = 0} ] When ( f(x), g(x), h(x) ) are complex polynomial functions, the conclusion does not necessarily hold.

Verification: [ f^2(x) = 0^2 = 0 ] [ x g^2(x) + x h^2(x) = x (1)^2 + x (i)^2 = x - x = 0 ] Here, even though ( f(x) = 0 ), both ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) are non-zero complex polynomials (constants in this case).

Therefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. 2. **Monotonicity**: f(x) is a decreasing function for x > 0. This means as x increases within (0, +infty), f(x) decreases. 3. **Specific Values**: Given that f(1) > 0 and f(2) < 0, there is at least one root in the interval (1,2) because the function changes sign. # Steps: 1. **Root Analysis near x=0 and Symmetry**: Since f(x) is an even function, the behavior on (-infty, 0) is a mirror image of the behavior on (0, infty). So, potential roots x on (0, infty) will have symmetric counterparts -x on (-infty, 0). 2. **Investigating Roots on (0, infty)**: - In the interval (1, 2), since f(1) > 0 and f(2) < 0, by the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), there is at least one root of f(x) = 0 in (1,2). - Given f(x) is decreasing for x > 0, there can be exactly one root between 1 and 2 because f(x) cannot increase between these points. 3. **Possible Additional Roots**: - Because f(x) is decreasing for x > 0 and f(x) is even, the symmetry indicates a root at -a for every root a > 0. - If another root exists greater than 2, it must follow the same decreasing nature and symmetry would guarantee another root on the negative side. 4. **Conclusion about the number of roots**: - We have identified a clear root between 1 and 2. - Symmetry would give two roots, one positive and one negative, if the function does not cross the x-axis again in (2, infty). - If there is another crossing, it would provide two more roots (one positive and one corresponding negative root). - Therefore, the number of real roots could be 2 or 3 due to the possibility of additional crossings in higher intervals. # Conclusion: Thus, the number of real roots of the equation f(x) = 0 can be 2 or 3.

We can notice 30 = 2 times 3 times 5 and 90 = 2 times 3^2 times 5. Thus, nu must contribute the additional factor of 3 making the LCM equal to 90. Therefore, nu must be of the form nu = 3n where n does not change the LCM contribution factors from 2, 5, nor should it introduce new factors that exceed 90. We have that mathop{text{lcm}}[3n, 30] = 90.

Now compare this with g(x): g(-x) = frac{4}{5x^{8} - 7} = g(x) Since g(-x) = g(x) for all x, the function satisfies the condition of being an even function.
