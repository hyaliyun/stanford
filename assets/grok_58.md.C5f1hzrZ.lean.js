Brenda, being half as fast, runs an additional 90 meters during the same time, totaling 120 + 90 = 210 meters. 5. **Track Length Check**: By the second meeting, we need the distance Brenda and Sally run together to be multiple full laps of the track.

So, the number of cats left after the sale is the initial number of cats minus the 20 cats sold: S + 20 - 20 = S (since 20 - 20 = 0) We are told that after the sale, they have 12 cats left.

Because the plane is colored with only two colors, if one color (red) is ruled out, the other (blue) must be present: - On this newly drawn circle, there could be either a red point or another blue point. 9. Since all the points on the first circle were blue: - If we extend this logic recursively, we eventually cover the entire plane with overlapping circles where all new points added must be blue, forming multiple pairs of blue points all at a distance of 2004 meters from each other. - Thus, the distance argument must repeat itself, confirming the problem's condition even for blue points. # Conclusion: We have proved that on a plane colored in two colors, there will always be two points of the same color at a distance of 2004 meters. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"there a quadrilateral (ABCD) with an area of 1 such that for any point (O) inside it, the area of at least one of the triangles (OAB), (OBC), (OCD), (DOA) is irrational?","completion":"1.

Simplifying this ratio gives us 2:1. 3. **Determine the number of students to sample from each section**: Since a total of 60 students are to be sampled and the ratio of students in the junior high school to the senior high school is 2:1, we allocate the samples proportionally. This means we sample frac{2}{3} of the total from the junior high school and frac{1}{3} from the senior high school.

Determining the number of chips in these rectangles: - Each 5 times 190 rectangle contains 950 cells. - Since we have four such rectangles in total around the grid: [ 4 times 950 = 3800 ] - This placement means we've positioned 3800 chips, complying with the constraints described. 5. Verification and justification of the upper bound: - Let’s label a row or column as \\"multicolored\\" if it contains both red and blue chips. - According to the problem, each chip must \\"see\\" at least five chips of the opposite color, implying it needs to reside in a multicolored row or column. 6. Estimating the number of chips in the multicolored rows/columns: - Since each row/column can contain at most 10 chips (5 of each color seeing the others): [ text{In 191 multicolored rows: } 191 times 10 = 1910 text{ chips} ] - In the remaining 9 rows (if all are non-multicolored) and assuming maximum occupancy: [ 9 times 200 = 1800 text{ chips} ] - Adding these together: [ 1910 + 1800 = 3710 text{ chips} ] 7. Another similar estimation involving columns instead of rows yields the consistent maximum count of: [ 190 times 10 + 190 times 10 = 3800 text{ chips} ] Conclusion: The derived analysis and layout examples show that the maximum number of chips possible while satisfying the given constraints is indeed: [ boxed{3800} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively, and bcos C+ccos B=2acos B.

Mathematically, if we have segments of lengths (a), (b), and (c), they must satisfy: [ a + b > c, quad b + c > a, quad text{and} quad c + a > b. ] 2. Consider the given set of sticks with lengths (1 text{ cm}, 2 text{ cm}, 3 text{ cm}, ldots, 91 text{ cm}). We need to determine the minimum number of sticks needed to ensure that at least one selection of these sticks can form a triangle. 3. Assume we want to find 8 sticks that cannot form a triangle. Let's see if such a selection is possible. 4. Select 7 sticks where each new stick's length is the sum of all previous sticks. For example, consider the lengths: [ 1 + 2 = 3, quad 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, quad 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12, quad 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 = 24, quad 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 48. ] Therefore, for lengths ( 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 ): [ S_1 = 1,quad S_2 = 2,quad S_3 = 3,quad S_4 = 6,quad S_5 = 12,quad S_6 = 24,quad S_7 = 48, ] the next stick ( S_8 ) should be: [ S_8 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96. ] 5. Notice, however, that (96 text{ cm}) is not a possible stick length within our initial set of 91 maximum. Hence, we can’t find 8 such sticks in our set where one of them equals the sum of the others. 6.

This can be rewritten by expanding and completing the square to make it easier to see how it will transform. - First, expand the expression: y = -x^2 - 2x. - To complete the square, we need to form a perfect square trinomial: y = -(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 1. - This simplifies to: y = -left(x + 1right)^2 + 1. 2. **Translation 2 Units to the Right**: To translate the parabola 2 units to the right, we substitute x with (x - 2) in the original equation. However, since we are starting from the completed square form y = -left(x + 1right)^2 + 1, we substitute x with (x - 2) in this form. But, considering the mistake in the substitution step, the correct step is to substitute x with (x - 2) in the form before completing the square, or directly adjust the completed square form by recognizing that moving 2 units to the right means replacing x with x - 2 in the vertex form, which actually results in x being replaced with (x - 1), not (x - 2), due to the original vertex being at -1. Thus, the equation becomes y = -left(x - 1right)^2 + 1. 3. **Translation 3 Units Down**: To translate the parabola 3 units down, we subtract 3 from the y-value in the equation obtained from step 2. - Starting with y = -left(x - 1right)^2 + 1, we subtract 3 from the y-value to get y = -left(x - 1right)^2 + 1 - 3. - Simplifying this gives us y = -left(x - 1right)^2 - 2.

In this interval, f(x) would be reduced to: [ f(x) = n - 2x ] Since n leq x < n+1, the minimum value of f(x) in this interval occurs when (x) is maximally close to (n+1), and so we compute [ f(x) = n - 2(n+1-0.0001) = -n - 2 + 0.0002. ] And the maximum value occurs when (x) is minimally more than (n), a value near (n): [ f(x) = n - 2n = -n. ] These observations cover the entire domain of x. We conclude that for any integer disharmony between (n) and (n+1), (f(x)) spans from a bit higher than (-n-2) up to (-n).

This means we want to minimize k while maximizing S. Since the difference between H and T is 8, and we want to maximize S, we should choose the smallest possible values for H and T that satisfy this condition. The smallest non-negative digits that have a difference of 8 are 0 and 8 or 1 and 9. However, since H is the hundreds digit, it cannot be 0 (otherwise, it wouldn't be a hundreds digit). Therefore, the smallest values we can choose are H = 1 and T = 9. Now, to minimize k/S further, we should choose the smallest possible value for U, which is 0.

Suppose (p) divides (b): (p mid b). In this case, the term (b^{n-1}) in the numerator contributes at least (n-1) factors of (p). b. Since (p) does not exceed (n), the exponent of (p) in the factorial (n!) is the number of times (p) appears in the product from 1 to (n), i.e., (n cdot frac{1}{p-1}). Therefore, if (p mid b), then the exponent of (p) in the numerator (which includes (b^{n-1})) is at least (n-1), and in the denominator ((n!)), it is at most (n-1). So the factors of (p) cancel out. 3. **Analysis When (p) Does Not Divide (b):** a. If (p nmid b), by the Pigeonhole Principle, among the numbers (a, a+b, cdots, a+(n-1)b), there is at least one number divisible by (p), since the congruence classes modulo (p) cover all remainders 0,1,...(p-1). b. In general, among the (n) terms, at least (leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor) terms are divisible by (p), (leftlfloor frac{n}{p^2} rightrfloor) terms divisible by (p^2), and so forth. Therefore, the total number of times (p) appears in the product (a(a+b)(a+2b)cdots[a+(n-1)b]) is: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{p}rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^2}rightrfloor + cdots ] This is the same as or greater than the exponent of (p) in (n!). Consequently, every (p leq n) appearing in the denominator will cancel with some in the numerator. # Conclusion: Thus, the given expression [ frac{b^{n-1} a(a+b)(a+2b)cdots[a+(n-1)b]}{n!} ] is indeed an integer.

At each step, we are allowed to choose two numbers A and B, erase them from the board, and then add the number A B to the board. We do this until only one number remains on the board. Can the number 2 remain?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are provided with the integers 1 through 2013 (inclusive). We are allowed to repeatedly pick any two numbers (A) and (B), replace them with (A - B), and continue this process until only one number remains. 2. **Invariant Identification:** We need to identify an invariant under the operation (A, B rightarrow A - B). An invariant is a property that remains unchanged throughout the operations. Here, we can consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the numbers on the board. 3. **Initial Sum Calculation:** First, calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 2013: [ S = sum_{k=1}^{2013} k ] Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) integers: [ S = frac{2013 times (2013 + 1)}{2} ] Simplify the expression: [ S = frac{2013 times 2014}{2} ] [ S = frac{2013 times 1007 times 2}{2} ] [ S = 2013 times 1007 ] 4. **Check Parity:** Determine the parity of (2013 times 1007). Both 2013 and 1007 are odd numbers, and the product of two odd numbers is always odd. Therefore, (S) is odd. 5. **Parity After Each Operation:** Each step involves replacing (A) and (B) with (A - B). Notice that this operation does not affect the parity of the remaining sum: - If (A) and (B) are both odd or both even, (A - B) will be even. - If one of (A) or (B) is odd and the other is even, (A - B) will be odd. In either case, the parity of the overall sum remains unchanged if those chosen numbers were replaced. Thus, the parity of the sum of numbers on the board remains invariant through each operation. 6. **Conclude the Result:** We started with an odd sum (as calculated above). Since replacing two numbers with their difference preserves the parity, it is impossible to end up with an even number (2 is even). The remaining number must be an odd number.

For the line to intersect the ellipse at two distinct points, the discriminant of this quadratic must be positive: [ Delta = (4k)^2 - 4(1 + 2k^2)(-6) > 0 ] [ 16k^2 + 24(1 + 2k^2) > 0 ] [ 16k^2 + 24 + 48k^2 > 0 ] [ 64k^2 + 24 > 0 ] [ 64k^2 > -24 ] Since ( k^2 geq 0 ), this inequality is always true, so the line always intersects the ellipse at two distinct points for any real ( k ). Next, we need to compute ( |CA| + |CB| ). The points ( A ) and ( B ) are the roots of the quadratic equation: [ (1 + 2k^2)x^2 + 4kx - 6 = 0 ] Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots ( x_1 + x_2 ) is: [ x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4k}{1 + 2k^2} ] The coordinates of ( A ) and ( B ) are ( (x_1, kx_1 + 1) ) and ( (x_2, kx_2 + 1) ), respectively. The distance ( |CA| ) and ( |CB| ) can be computed using the distance formula: [ |CA| = sqrt{(x_1 + 2sqrt{2})^2 + (kx_1 + 1)^2} ] [ |CB| = sqrt{(x_2 + 2sqrt{2})^2 + (kx_2 + 1)^2} ] To maximize ( |CA| + |CB| ), we need to find the maximum value of: [ sqrt{(x_1 + 2sqrt{2})^2 + (kx_1 + 1)^2} + sqrt{(x_2 + 2sqrt{2})^2 + (kx_2 + 1)^2} ] This is a complex optimization problem that can be solved numerically.

So, after the first month, his weight was 192 - 9.6 = 182.4 pounds. 2. Second month: 7% of 182.4 pounds = 0.07 * 182.4 = 12.768 pounds. So, after the second month, his weight was 182.4 - 12.768 = 169.632 pounds. 3. Third month: 9% of 169.632 pounds = 0.09 * 169.632 = 15.26688 pounds.

If the selling price is reduced by 2 yuan, the new selling price becomes 30 - 2 = 28 yuan per kilogram. According to the problem, for every 1 yuan reduction in price, the sales volume increases by 10 kilograms. Therefore, reducing the price by 2 yuan increases the sales volume by 2 times 10 = 20 kilograms. The original sales volume is 60 kilograms, so the new sales volume is 60 + 20 = 80 kilograms. The profit per kilogram is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is 28 - 15 = 13 yuan. Therefore, the daily sales profit after reducing the price by 2 yuan is: text{Daily Sales Profit} = (text{Selling Price} - text{Cost Price}) times text{New Sales Volume} = 13 times 80 = 1040 text{ yuan} So, the daily sales profit after reducing the price by 2 yuan is boxed{1040 text{ yuan}}. Part (2): Maximizing the Daily Sales Profit Let x be the selling price per kilogram in yuan. The profit per kilogram then is x - 15. The increase in sales volume for each 1 yuan reduction in price from the original 30 yuan is 10 kilograms, so the total sales volume can be expressed as 60 + (30 - x) times 10. Therefore, the daily profit w can be formulated as: w = (x - 15) times [60 + (30 - x) times 10] Expanding and simplifying this expression gives: w = -10(x - frac{51}{2})^2 + 1102.5 This equation represents a parabola that opens downwards, indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of a parabola y = a(x - h)^2 + k shows that the maximum value of w occurs at x = h, which in this case is x = frac{51}{2}. Therefore, when the selling price per kilogram is set at x = frac{51}{2} yuan, the profit obtained from selling Sunshine Rose grapes per day is maximized.

The painter takes one white checker, repaints it black, and places it on any free cell. 2. **Suppose Contrary:** Assume the contrary, that at every stage, there are no two neighboring cells (either sharing a side) that hold checkers of different colors. 3. **Intermediate Observation:** At the start, the entire 10 times 10 board is white, hence any row or column will initially be completely white. 4. **Maintaining the No Neighbor Property:** To maintain the property that no two neighbors have different colors, when a checker turns black and is placed back, the surrounding checkers remain unaffected. As more black checkers are added, for each one placed, the critical part is what happens around it. There must be consideration for rows and columns where the black checkers accumulate. 5. **Checker Replacement Dynamics:** Each step involves turning one white checker black, resulting in k+1 black checkers until all 91 checkers turn black. However, maintaining the condition of no differently colored neighbors implies that at any step, rows or columns involved must be consistently homogeneous (all one color). 6. **Culminating Observation:** However, logically considering each stage, the transformation from an initial all-white board to an all-black board requires, at some stage, checkers which disrupt this monochromatic consistency, contradicting our maintenance condition. Consequently, 7. **Inevitable Result:** It is inevitable that during this repainting process, there exists at least a point where two neighboring cells have checkers of different colors. This is because, otherwise, there wouldn't be a feasible path from an all-white composition to an all-black board without neighbors differing at any stage in between. **Conclusion:** Hence, it is proven that at some moment, there will be neighboring checkers of different colors on the board. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the value of frac{18}{45} frac{3}{8}.","completion":"First, simplify the fraction frac{18}{45}, which shares the common factors of 9: [ frac{18}{45} = frac{18 div 9}{45 div 9} = frac{2}{5}. ] Next, identify a common denominator for frac{2}{5} and frac{3}{8} to perform the subtraction.

This transformation gives us a new expression for f(x), which is f(x) = e^{x} - x + t. Given that f(x) is a monotonic function on the domain (0, +infty) and satisfies the condition f[f(x) - e^{x} + x] = e for all x in (0, +infty), we can deduce that t must be a constant. This is because the output of f is constant (e), and the input to f is a function of x that must also be constant to satisfy the given condition for all x. Thus, we have f(t) = e^{t} = e. Solving for t gives us t = 1, which leads to f(x) = e^{x} - x + 1 and f'(x) = e^{x} - 1. Next, we examine the inequality f(x) + f'(x) geq ax for all x in (0, +infty). Substituting our expressions for f(x) and f'(x), we get e^{x} - x + 1 + e^{x} - 1 geq ax, which simplifies to 2e^{x} - x geq ax.

Differentiate f(x): [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(xcos x - sin x) = cos x - xsin x - cos x = -xsin x.] 2. Analyze the sign of f'(x): Since -xsin x is the derivative, and given x is in the interval [-pi, 0], we know that sin x leqslant 0. Therefore, the product -xsin x is also leqslant 0 because -x is non-positive (x is negative or zero) and sin x is non-positive as well.

Sandra saved 10, her mother gave her 4, and her father gave her twice as much as her mother, which is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total cost of the candies and jelly beans is the amount she spent, which is 11. So, the equation for the total cost is: ( 14C + 20J = 11 ) However, we only need to find the cost of one candy, and we don't have the cost of one jelly bean or another equation to solve this system of equations. But we know that Sandra will be left with 11 after buying 14 candies and 20 jelly beans, which means the total cost of 14 candies and 20 jelly beans is 11. Since we are only asked to find the cost of one candy, we can assume the cost of jelly beans is 0 for the sake of this problem (as it doesn't affect the amount Sandra is left with and we don't have enough information to find the exact cost of jelly beans). So, the equation simplifies to: ( 14C = 11 ) Now, we can solve for ( C ) to find the cost of one candy: ( C = 11 / 14 ) ( C = 0.7857 ) Since it's not common to have a price like 0.7857, we can round it to the nearest cent, which would be 0.79. Therefore, one candy costs approximately boxed{0.79} ."},{"prompt":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term being 1 and the common difference being 2, and {b_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term being 1 and the common ratio being 2.

Multiplying the second equation by 10 for easier calculation: 4x + 5y = 350.

If n is even, x = n/2 only if n/2 is non-prime; otherwise, he should select the nearest non-prime number around n/2. Step 2: Jenn's Optimal Response Post Bela’s move, Jenn needs to find a point outside the 1.5 unit range from x, maximizing her future options. She should choose points on opposite ends of the range from x, ensuring maximum scope for future moves. The positions should also be non-prime when possible, confining her choices further.

Each choice further limits the interval size by 1.5 units on either side, cumulatively restricting available options.

We are to determine which of the statements A, B, C, and D are true based on these conditions. **Statement A: a^2 + b^2 geq frac{1}{2}** 1. Starting with the identity (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and knowing that a + b = 1, we substitute to get 1^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. 2. We know that 2ab > 0 since both a and b are positive. Thus, a^2 + b^2 = 1 - 2ab < 1. 3. Since a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 1, and 2ab > 0, we can say a^2 + b^2 > 1 - 2ab. 4. Given that a + b = 1, we have 2(a^2 + b^2) > 1, which simplifies to a^2 + b^2 geq frac{1}{2} after dividing both sides by 2.

To show that 2^{(a-b)} > frac{1}{2}, it's equivalent to showing that a - b > -1 because 2^x > frac{1}{2} for any x > -1. 2. Since a + b = 1, we know that a > 0 and b < 1. Therefore, a - b > -1 holds true because a and b are both positive and their sum is 1.

Using the property of logarithms, log_2(a) + log_2(b) = log_2(ab). 2. Since a + b = 1, the arithmetic mean of a and b is frac{1}{2}. By the AM-GM inequality, sqrt{ab} leq frac{a + b}{2} = frac{1}{2}. 3. Therefore, ab leq frac{1}{4}, and log_2(ab) leq log_2left(frac{1}{4}right) = -2.

Prove that this maximum does not depend on how Petya colored them.","completion":"To show that the maximum sum of distances obtained by Vasya is independent of how Petya colors the points, we can proceed as follows: 1. **Consider the setup**: We have 1996 points placed on a line at equal intervals. Henceforth, we can label these points as (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{1996}). 2. **Let Petya color half of the points red and half blue**: Let us assume Petya colors the first 998 points red and the remaining 998 points blue. This coloring is arbitrary and can be any other distribution, but we will show that it does not affect the outcome. 3. **Pair red and blue points for maximum distance**: - Vasya's goal is to pair each red point with exactly one blue point to maximize the sum of distances between paired points. - We need to determine the optimal way to pair these points such that the total distance is maximized. Consider the strategy of pairing the first red point (at (A_1)) with the last blue point (at (A_{1996})), the second red point (at (A_2)) with the second last blue point (at (A_{1995})), and so on. This configuration maximizes the individual pair distances. 4. **Calculate the distance sum in this configuration**: - The distances involved are between (A_1) and (A_{1996}), (A_2) and (A_{1995}), etc. In general, the distance between point (A_i) and point (A_{1997-i}) will be: [ (1996 - (i - 1)) - i = 1996 - i - (i - 1) = 1997 - 2i ] 5. **Sum the individual distances**: - The total sum of these distances for (i) ranging from 1 to 998 (since there are 998 points of each color) can be written as: [ sum_{i=1}^{998} (1997 - 2i) ] 6. **Simplify the summation**: - This sum can be broken down using the formula for the sum of a sequence: [ sum_{i=1}^{998} 1997 - sum_{i=1}^{998} 2i = 1997 times 998 - 2 left(frac{998 times 999}{2}right) ] - Compute each term: [ 1997 times 998 = 1992006 ] - and [ 2 left(frac{998 times 999}{2}right) = 998 times 999 = 997002 ] - Thus, the total sum is: [ 1992006 - 997002 = 996004 ] 7. **Conclude that the result is independent of the initial red-blue distribution**: - By symmetry and the equal number of red and blue points, any reconfiguration of colors leads to the same summation of distances when paired optimally. - Therefore, the maximum sum of distances does not depend on which specific points were colored red or blue by Petya. **Conclusion**: The maximum possible sum of the distances between paired points is independent of how Petya colors the points.

Let's correct it: The work done by the original group in one day is ( frac{1}{10} ) of the total work, and the work done by the remaining men in one day is ( frac{1}{12} ) of the total work. Since the work done by each man is additive, we can say that the work done by ( x ) men in one day is ( x ) times the work done by one man in one day.

The standard equation of the parabola is x^2 = -frac{1}{4}y. The focus is located on the y-axis. 2. From the given equation, we have 2p = frac{1}{4}. So, p = frac{1}{8}. 3. The equation of the latus rectum is given by y = p/2. Substituting the value of p, we get y = frac{1}{16}. Therefore, the equation of the latus rectum is boxed{y = frac{1}{16}}. Hence, the correct answer is option (A)."},{"prompt":"Given the parabola C: y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right), the line x2y+1=0 intersects C at points A and B, and |AB|=4sqrt{15}.

To find the intersection points, we solve the system of equations: [ begin{cases} x-2y+1=0 y^{2}=2px end{cases} ] By substituting x from the first equation into the second, we get y^{2}-4py+2p=0. This gives us the sum and product of the roots as y_{1}+y_{2}=4p and y_{1}y_{2}=2p. The discriminant Delta =16p^{2}-8p must be greater than 0 for real roots, leading to p(2p-1) gt 0, which implies p gt frac{1}{2}. The distance between A and B is given by |AB|=sqrt{1+4}|y_{1}-y_{2}|=sqrt{5}sqrt{(y_{1}+y_{2})^{2}-4y_{1}y_{2}}=4sqrt{15}. Substituting the values of y_{1}+y_{2} and y_{1}y_{2}, we find that 16p^{2}-8p=48, leading to the quadratic equation 2p^{2}-p-6=0. Solving this equation gives (2p+3)(p-2)=0, hence p=2 since p>0. Therefore, the value of p is boxed{p=2}. **Part (2): Finding the minimum area of triangle MNF** Given y^{2}=4x, the focus F is at (1,0). For points M and N on the parabola such that overrightarrow{MF}cdot overrightarrow{NF}=0, we consider the line MN to be x=my+n. Solving the system [ begin{cases} y^{2}=4x x=my+n end{cases} ] gives y^{2}-4my-4n=0, leading to y_{1}+y_{2}=4m and y_{1}y_{2}=-4n. The condition overrightarrow{MF}cdotoverrightarrow{NF}=0 simplifies to (m^2+1)y_1y_2+m(n-1)(y_1+y_2)+(n-1)^2=0. Substituting y_{1}+y_{2}=4m and y_{1}y_{2}=-4n into this equation, we get 4m^{2}=n^{2}-6n+1. The inequality n^{2}-6n+1geqslant 0 gives ngeqslant 3+2sqrt{2} or nleqslant 3-2sqrt{2}. The distance from point F to line MN is d=frac{|n-1|}{sqrt{1+{m}^{2}}}. The length of MN is |MN|=2sqrt{1+{m}^{2}}|n-1|. Thus, the area of triangle MNF is S=frac{1}{2}|MN|times d=frac{1}{2}times 2sqrt{1+{m}^{2}}|n-1|^2. The minimum area of triangle MNF occurs when n=3-2sqrt{2}, leading to S_{min }=(2-2sqrt{2})^{2}=12-8sqrt{2}.

When a = frac{1}{2}, f(x) = (x+2)lnx + frac{1}{2}x^2 - 4x + frac{7}{2}. The domain of the function f(x) is (0, +∞). The derivative of the function is f'(x) = lnx + frac{2}{x} + x - 3. Let g(x) = lnx + frac{2}{x} + x - 3, then g'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{2}{x^2} + 1 = frac{x^2 + x - 2}{x^2} = frac{(x+2)(x-1)}{x^2} (x > 0). When 0 < x < 1, g'(x) < 0; when x > 1, g'(x) > 0. This means that the function g(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +∞). Thus, when x > 0, g(x) ≥ g(1) = 0 (equality holds if and only if x = 1). In other words, when x > 0, f'(x) ≥ 0 (equality holds if and only if x = 1). Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, +∞) and has at most one zero. Since f(1) = 0, x = 1 is the unique zero of the function f(x). Hence, if a = frac{1}{2}, the only zero of the function f(x) is boxed{x = 1}. 2. Proof 1: Since f(x) = (x+2)lnx + ax^2 - 4x + 7a, the domain of the function f(x) is (0, +∞), and its derivative is f'(x) = lnx + frac{x+2}{x} + 2ax - 4. When a ≥ frac{1}{2}, f'(x) ≥ lnx + frac{2}{x} + x - 3. From part 1, we know that lnx + frac{2}{x} + x - 3 ≥ 0. Thus, when x > 0, f'(x) ≥ 0. This means that the function f(x) is increasing on (0, +∞). Therefore, f(x) has no extreme value. Proof 2: Since f(x) = (x+2)lnx + ax^2 - 4x + 7a, the domain of the function f(x) is (0, +∞), and its derivative is f'(x) = lnx + frac{x+2}{x} + 2ax - 4.

When a ≥ frac{1}{2}, the solutions to h(x) = 2ax^2 + x - 2 = 0 are x1 = frac{-1 - sqrt{1 + 16a}}{4a} < 0 and x2 = frac{-1 + sqrt{1 + 16a}}{4a} > 0. Thus, when 0 < x < x2, h(x) < 0, i.e., m'(x) < 0; when x > x2, h(x) > 0, i.e., m'(x) > 0. This means that f'(x) is decreasing on (0, x2) and increasing on (x2, +∞).

We are looking for a value of k such that: μ - kσ > 48 Substituting the given values: 55 - k(2) > 48 Now, let's solve for k: 55 - 2k > 48 -2k > 48 - 55 -2k > -7 Now, divide both sides by -2, remembering to reverse the inequality because we are dividing by a negative number: k < 7 / 2 k < 3.5 So, the number of standard deviations below the mean that is greater than 48 is less than 3.5. Since we typically consider whole or half standard deviations, the closest whole number of standard deviations below the mean that is greater than 48 would be 3 standard deviations (since 4 standard deviations below would be too much and give us a value less than 48). Therefore, the number of standard deviations below the mean that is greater than 48 is boxed{3} ."},{"prompt":"A point is equidistant from the coordinate axes if the vertical distance from the point to the ( x )axis is equal to the horizontal distance from the point to the ( y )axis.

To solve for ( h_{m}^{prime}(n) ), the number of ways to color a ( 2 times n ) chessboard with ( m ) colors such that adjacent squares differ in color and each color is used at least once, we need to consider the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 2. The principle of inclusion-exclusion will help us count the valid colorings by first considering all possible colorings and then subtracting the overcounted ones (where some colors might not appear). 3. Start by considering all possible ways to color the ( 2 times n ) chessboard without any restriction on the usage of colors.

To find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {frac{a_n}{n+1}}, we need to first find the equation of the tangent line at the point (1,1). To do this, we need to find the value of its slope, which can be obtained by first finding the derivative of the function at x=2, and then using the geometric meaning of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line, which gives us the equation of the line and subsequently the ordinate of the point where the tangent line intersects the y-axis. Finally, we can use the sum formula for a geometric sequence to calculate the sum. **Steps:** 1. Find the derivative of the function y=x^n(1-x). This gives us y'=nx^{n-1}-(n+1)x^n. 2. Find the slope of the tangent line at x=2. Substitute x=2 into the derivative to get k=n2^{n-1}-(n+1)2^{n}. 3. Find the point of tangency at x=2. Substitute x=2 into the function to get (2,-2^{n}). 4. Find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form y-y_1=m(x-x_1), which gives us y+2^{n}=k(x-2). 5. Find the ordinate of the point where the tangent line intersects the y-axis by setting x=0. This gives us a_n=(n+1)2^{n}. 6. Find the general term of the sequence {frac{a_n}{n+1}} by dividing a_n by n+1. This gives us b_n=2^{n}. 7. Find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence. This is a geometric sequence with first term 2 and common ratio 2. Using the sum formula S_n=afrac{1-r^n}{1-r}, we get 2+2^{2}+2^{3}+...+2^{n}=2^{n+1}-2.

The side length of this octagon equals the diameter of a small circle, which is 8 units (twice the radius). Since each side of an octagon is tangent to the neighboring circle's center, we can consider the geometry of the octagon. We know from the geometry of a regular octagon that each internal angle is 135^circ. We can split the octagon into isosceles triangles by connecting the centers of the small circles to the center of the large circle (which is the circumscribed circle around the octagon). Each triangle formed has a vertex angle of 45^circ (which is 360^circ/8 degrees) at the center of the large circle and base angles of 67.5^circ (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ and the other two angles are equal in an isosceles triangle). Using a triangle where the sides are radii of the large circle (say R) and the base is a side of the octagon (8 units), drop a perpendicular from the center of the large circle to the midpoint of the base of the triangle, splitting it into two right triangles.

The strategy is to convert the circle's equation into standard form, find the circle's center coordinates and radius, calculate the distance from the center to the line, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the chord's half-length. **Steps:** 1.

Define the external tangent line common to Gamma_A and Gamma_B and touching segment AB as l_{AB}, and similarly for l_{BC}, l_{CD}, l_{DE}, l_{EF}, l_{FA}. 3. Based on geometric properties, specifically the alignment of external tangents to the incircles, we can show that: - (l_{AF} parallel l_{DE}) - (l_{AB} parallel l_{EF}) - (l_{BC} parallel l_{FA}) 4. Utilizing this parallelism, we introduce points of intersection: - (A_1) is the intersection of l_{FA} and l_{AB}. - (B_1) is the intersection of l_{AB} and l_{BC}. - (C_1) is the intersection of l_{BC} and l_{CD}. - (D_1) is the intersection of l_{CD} and l_{DE}. - (E_1) is the intersection of l_{DE} and l_{EF}. - (F_1) is the intersection of l_{EF} and l_{FA}. 5.

The total number of people in Smithtown is the sum of right-handed and left-handed people, which is 3x + x = 4x. Similarly, the total number of people is also the sum of men and women, which is 3y + 2y = 5y. Since these two totals must be equal (they both represent the total population of Smithtown), we have 4x = 5y. Now, we want to maximize the number of right-handed men. Since the number of right-handed people is 3x and the number of men is 3y, the maximum number of right-handed men would be the smaller of these two numbers. To maximize this, we would allocate all the men to be right-handed if possible. Since there are more right-handed people than men (3x vs. 3y and 4x = 5y), we can allocate all the men to be right-handed. This means that all 3y men are right-handed. Now, we need to find the number of left-handed women. Since all men are right-handed, all left-handed people must be women. Therefore, the number of left-handed women is x. To find the percentage of left-handed women out of the total population, we divide the number of left-handed women by the total number of people and multiply by 100: Percentage of left-handed women = (x / 4x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25% Therefore, boxed{25%} of all the people in Smithtown are left-handed women."},{"prompt":"the given figure, in square (ABCD), (F) is the midpoint of side (BC), (GC=2DG), and (E) is the intersection point of (DF) and (BG).

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Understanding the Projection**: - A unit cube has its edges aligned along the coordinate axes with length (1) for each edge. - When projecting a three-dimensional shape onto a two-dimensional plane, we typically use orthogonal (right-angle) projection to preserve lengths proportionately but not necessarily areas. 2. **Symmetry and Direction of Projection**: - The cube has three pairs of parallel edges. For orthogonal projection, consider each class of edges separately. - The projection of a cube onto a plane that faces one of its faces is simply a square of area (1) (unit square). - However, projecting in arbitrary directions can add complexity. The goal is to project in such a way that maximizes the resultant area. 3. **Maximum Projection Consideration**: - The projection of a cube under orthogonal projection yields a centrally symmetric convex polygon. - The polygon resulting from the projection is either a parallelogram (often a rectangle) or a centrally symmetric hexagon. - The projection that maximizes the area occurs when the direction of projection aligns with the diagonal of the cube. 4. **Orthogonal Projections in Three Dimensions**: - When viewing the cube from the perspective such that its body diagonals are perpendicular to the projection plane, the projection appears as a regular hexagon. - The body diagonal of a unit cube has length (sqrt{3}), since it spans along three edges. 5. **Detailed Calculation**: - Let’s consider projecting the cube along a plane perpendicular to the space diagonal (body diagonal). - In the ideal situation, each face of the cube contributes equally to the projected area.

Is it true that the largest radius of such a circle belongs to the crosssection passing through the center of the polyhedron?","completion":": 1. **To prove the first statement:** Let's denote: - ( M_1 ) as the polygon obtained by intersecting our polyhedron with any plane not passing through the center. - ( S ) as the area of this polygon ( M_1 ). - ( M_2 ) as the polygon symmetric to ( M_1 ) with respect to the center of the polyhedron. Let: - ( P ) be the least convex polyhedron containing ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) (which is known as the convex hull of ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 )). Clearly, ( P ) is a centrally-symmetric polyhedron and its center coincides with the center of the original polyhedron. All vertices of ( P ) are either vertices of ( M_1 ) or vertices of ( M_2 ). Let ( M ) be the polygon obtained by intersecting ( P ) with a plane passing through the center of ( P ) and parallel to the faces of ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). Let ( q ) be the area of this polygon. Consider any face ( N ) of polyhedron ( P ), different from ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). Any plane parallel to ( N ) either intersects none or intersects all three polygons ( M_1 ), ( M_2 ), and ( M ). Since ( P ) is convex, let us denote the line segments along which these planes intersect ( M_1 ), ( M_2 ), and ( M ) as ( l_1 ), ( l_2 ), and ( l ) respectively. By the properties of convexity, these segments satisfy ( l geq frac{1}{2}(l_1 + l_2) ). Therefore, by integrating this inequality for all such planes, we get that ( q geq S ). Thus, the area of the section passing through the center is at least as large as any section not passing through the center. **Conclusion**: The first statement is (boxed{text{true}}). 2. **To disprove the second statement:** Construct a counterexample.

However, (frac{sqrt{2}}{2} < sqrt{frac{2}{3}}). Therefore, contrary to the second statement, the section passing through the center does not necessarily have the largest circumradius. **Conclusion**: The second statement is (boxed{text{false}})."},{"prompt":"Find the maximum value of the expression ( (sin 3x + sin 2y + sin z)(cos 3x + cos 2y + cos z) ).","completion":"1. **Identify the problem:** We need to find the maximum value of the expression: [ ( sin 3x + sin 2y + sin z)( cos 3x + cos 2y + cos z ). ] 2. **Utilize known inequalities:** We know that for any (a, b, ) and (c), the following inequality holds: [ ab leq frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}. ] This inequality is equivalent to: [ 2ab leq a^2 + b^2 quad text{or} quad 0 leq (a - b)^2, ] which is always true since the square of a real number is non-negative. 3. **Apply another standard inequality:** Another useful inequality is: [ (a + b + c)^2 leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). ] This can be expanded and rewritten as: [ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + frac{2(a^2 + b^2)}{2} + frac{2(a^2 + c^2)}{2} + frac{2(b^2 + c^2)}{2} = 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). ] 4. **Break down the original expression using these inequalities:** Consider: [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma). ] Using the inequality mentioned, we can express the product as: [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) leq frac{1}{2} left( (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)^2 + (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)^2 right). ] 5. **Simplify the expression:** Now, let's expand the squared terms and use the known trigonometric identities (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1): [ begin{aligned} & (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)^2 + (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)^2 leq 3 left( sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + sin^2 gamma + cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma right) & leq 3 left( (sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha) + (sin^2 beta + cos^2 beta) + (sin^2 gamma + cos^2 gamma) right) & = 3 left( 1 + 1 + 1 right) = 3 times 3 = 9. end{aligned} ] Therefore, we have: [ frac{1}{2} times 9 = frac{9}{2}. ] 6. **Verify the maximum value:** Checking if this value is achievable, let (alpha = beta = gamma = frac{pi}{4}): [ sin frac{pi}{4} = cos frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. ] Thus, [ left( sin frac{pi}{4} + sin frac{pi}{4} + sin frac{pi}{4} right) left( cos frac{pi}{4} + cos frac{pi}{4} + cos frac{pi}{4} right) = left( frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} right) left( frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} right) = left( frac{9 times 2}{4} right) = frac{9}{2} = 4.5. ] 7. **Conclusion:** The maximum value of the expression is: [ boxed{4.5}. ]"},{"prompt":"Sandy sold lemonade in her neighborhood for five days.

For such case B_2 and C_2 are same as A_1 with the intersection point directly as A_1. If P is none of the vertices or edge-aligned, then no point A_2, B_2, C_2 coincides with A_1, B_1, C_1, making Ceva theorem applicable generally.

The length of the other train is approximately 320.04 metres. What is the speed of the second train?","completion":"To find the speed of the second train, we first need to determine the relative speed at which the two trains cross each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. The speed of the first train is given as 120 kmph. To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s. So, the speed of the first train in m/s is: 120 kmph * (5/18) = (120 * 5) / 18 = 600 / 18 = 33.33 m/s The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: 180 metres + 320.04 metres = 500.04 metres The time taken to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. Now, we can use the formula for relative speed (Vr) when two objects are moving in opposite directions: Vr = Distance / Time Plugging in the values we have: Vr = 500.04 metres / 9 seconds = 55.56 m/s (approximately) This relative speed is the sum of the speeds of both trains. We already know the speed of the first train, so we can find the speed of the second train (V2) by subtracting the speed of the first train from the relative speed: V2 = Vr - Speed of the first train V2 = 55.56 m/s - 33.33 m/s = 22.23 m/s Now, to convert the speed of the second train back to kmph, we use the conversion factor in reverse: 1 m/s = 18/5 kmph So, the speed of the second train in kmph is: 22.23 m/s * (18/5) = (22.23 * 18) / 5 = 399.14 / 5 = 79.83 kmph Therefore, the speed of the second train is approximately boxed{79.83} kmph."},{"prompt":"Let the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} be S_n, satisfying S_{10} S_{5} = 20.

There must be at least two points among ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) that are at most 1 unit apart. - Since the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is the maximum distance, any other point ( C ) must be within a distance of 1 from either ( A ) or ( B ). 4. **Implication of the condition**: - If the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is greater than 1, then consider point ( C ). Point ( C ) must be within 1 unit distance from either ( A ) or ( B ) because of the problem's condition that among any three points, two of them must be within a distance of 1. - If the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is not greater than 1, then all points lie within the circles centered at ( A ) or ( B ), as we chose the maximum possible distance between ( A ) and ( B ). 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, any other point ( C ) among the ( n ) points should be within one of the two circles of radius 1 centered at ( A ) and ( B ).

Since the students in the car depart 45 minutes (or frac{45}{60} = frac{3}{4} hours) later than the students on bicycles, the equation to represent their travel times is: [ frac{15}{x} - frac{15}{4x} = frac{3}{4} ] Multiplying every term by 4x to clear the denominators, we get: [ 4 cdot 15 - 15 = 3x ] Simplifying this, we have: [ 60 - 15 = 3x 45 = 3x ] Dividing both sides by 3, we find the speed of the bicycles: [ x = frac{45}{3} = 15 ] Upon substituting x = 15 back into our original equation to verify: [ frac{15}{15} - frac{15}{4 cdot 15} = frac{3}{4} 1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4} ] This confirms that x = 15 km/h satisfies the conditions of the problem.

The magnitude of overrightarrow{a} is |overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{(-1)^2 + (1)^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}. The projection of overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{a} is given by frac{overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|} = frac{-2}{sqrt{2}} = -sqrt{2}.

Next, A chooses another uncolored vertex and colors it yellow. After A, B chooses another uncolored vertex and colors it green, and so on. When all vertices are colored, if there exists an equilateral triangle with all three vertices of the same color, A wins. Otherwise, B wins. Do A and B both have a guaranteed winning strategy?","completion":"Given that the figure is formed by a combination of several regular hexagons sharing 2018 vertices, we need to determine if there is a winning strategy for either of the two players, text{Jia} (甲) and text{Yi} (乙). The game rules are as follows: 1. text{Jia} starts by coloring a vertex yellow. 2. Then text{Yi} colors an uncolored vertex green. 3. The process alternates until all vertices are colored. 4. If at any point, there exists an equilateral triangle with all vertices of the same color, text{Jia} wins. 5. If no such triangle exists after all vertices are colored, text{Yi} wins. Given these rules, let's analyze and develop the strategy. Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Hexagonal Lattice Insight:** - The lattice consists of equilateral triangles. Any three vertices forming an equilateral triangle on the hexagonal grid are either colinear or triangular in the 2D plane. 2. **Configuration of Vertices:** - We observe the vertices in ordered layers of hexagons. Given the symmetrical nature of the hexagons, we can see that equilateral triangles may form, sharing sides potentially. 3. **Pairing the Vertices:** - We can consider the vertices grouped in pairs. Let’s denote vertices as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2018}. Upon pairing, we divide them into 1009 groups: { {A_1, A_2}, {A_3, A_4}, ldots, {A_{2017}, A_{2018}} }. 4. **Declaration of Strategy:** - When text{Jia} colors a vertex, text{Yi} must color the paired vertex in a different color. This ensures that any equilateral triangle within any individual hexagon or across multiple hexagons cannot have all vertices of the same color. # Conclusion By following this pairing strategy, text{Yi} ensures no monochromatic equilateral triangles form in the lattice, ultimately leading text{Yi} to win consistently regardless of text{Jia}'s moves. Hence, text{Yi} has a winning strategy. boxed{text{Yi has a winning strategy}}"},{"prompt":"Two of the altitudes of the scalene triangle PQR have lengths 5 and 15.

The minimum number of 1.5ton trucks required for this task is ( ): A: 12 trucks B: 11 trucks C: 10 trucks D: 9 truck","completion":"**Solution 1:** Start loading cargo boxes onto the first truck, and continue loading until adding one more box would exceed 1.5 tons. Set aside the excess box, as it cannot be loaded onto subsequent trucks. Since 13.5 div (1.5 + 0.35) approx 7.3, at least 7 trucks (including the set-aside box) can be loaded this way with some cargo remaining. 1. If the remaining cargo after loading the 7th truck is less than 1.5 tons, the 8th truck can transport it. The 7 set-aside boxes can be divided into two groups: one with 3 boxes and one with 4. Neither group exceeds 0.35 times 4 = 1.4 tons. Two more trucks can transport these boxes, making a total of 10 trucks. 2. If the remaining cargo after loading the 7th truck exceeds 1.5 tons, it can be loaded onto the 8th truck. The 8 set-aside boxes can be divided into two groups of 4 boxes each, neither of which exceeds 0.35 times 4 = 1.4 tons. Two more trucks can transport these boxes. The first 10 trucks transport over 1.5 times 8 = 12 tons, leaving at most 13.5 - 12 = 1.5 tons. One more truck can transport this remaining cargo, making a total of 11 trucks. In conclusion, to ensure that all cargo can be transported at once, at least 11 trucks are required. **Solution 2:** According to the problem, arrange all the cargo boxes in any order. Load the boxes onto the first truck one by one until adding another box would exceed the truck's capacity. Place the last box that couldn't be loaded next to the first truck. Repeat this process for the second, third, ..., eighth trucks, until each truck has been loaded and there is one box left next to the eighth truck. Clearly, the sum of the weights of the boxes on each of the first eight trucks, plus the weight of the box left next to it, exceeds 1.5 tons. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining boxes is less than 1.5 tons and can be loaded onto the ninth truck. Then, load the boxes left next to the first eight trucks onto the last two trucks, with four boxes on each truck, ensuring that neither truck is overloaded. Thus, 11 trucks are needed to transport all the cargo boxes at once. Therefore, the answer is boxed{text{B}}.

First, we write the inequality in a form that we can solve: [ frac{a^x}{a^x + b^x + c^x} leq frac{1}{1 + 2a}. ] This requires that: [ a^x(1 + 2a) leq a^x + b^x + c^x. ] 5. **Simplifying the inequality:** [ a^x + 2a^{x+1} leq a^x + b^x + c^x, ] which simplifies to: [ 2a^{x+1} leq b^x + c^x. ] 6. **Use of AM-GM Inequality:** Applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality): [ b^x + c^x geq 2sqrt{b^x c^x}. ] 7. **Substituting the product condition (abc = 1):** Given ( abc = 1 ), we have ( c = frac{1}{ab} ).

Given that the points ( A, B, C, D, P ) lie on a circle and the angles ( angle APB = angle BPC = angle CPD ), we need to prove that the lengths of the segments satisfy the relation ( frac{a + c}{b + d} = frac{b}{c} ). 2. Let the lengths of the segments be denoted as follows: - ( AB = a ) - ( BC = b ) - ( CD = c ) - ( DA = d ) 3. Since ( angle APB = angle BPC = angle CPD ), the arcs subtended by these angles are equal. Therefore, the chords subtended by these arcs are also equal. Let the common length of these chords be ( x ). Thus, we have: - ( AB = BC = CD = x ) 4. By Ptolemy's Theorem, for a cyclic quadrilateral ( ABCD ), the following relation holds: [ AB cdot CD + BC cdot DA = AC cdot BD ] Applying Ptolemy's Theorem to the quadrilateral ( ABCD ), we get: [ a cdot c + b cdot d = AC cdot BD ] 5. Since ( angle APB = angle BPC = angle CPD ), the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) are also equal. Let ( AC = BD = y ). 6. Using Ptolemy's Theorem again for the quadrilateral ( ABPD ), we get: [ AB cdot PD + AP cdot BD = AD cdot BP ] Since ( AB = BC = CD = x ) and ( AC = BD = y ), we can write: [ a cdot c + b cdot d = y^2 ] 7.

This is because the chessboard contains 64 squares, and starting from one counts as the first square. 2. **Counting the Moves and Color Changes:** - A chessboard is an 8x8 grid with alternating black and white squares. - When the rook moves exactly one square in any direction, it lands on a square of the opposite color. This pattern of alternating colors continues for each move: - 1st move ⟹ Different color - 2nd move ⟹ Back to original color - 3rd move ⟹ Different color - … - (n^{th}) move ⟹ (text{different/original color depending on whether } n text{ is odd/even}) 3. **Examine the Start and End Points:** - The rook starts at the bottom-left corner (1st square, which we'll assume is white). - The objective is to reach the top-right corner (64th square) by making 63 moves. 4. **Considering the Parity of Moves:** - After making an odd number of moves (e.g., 63), the rook will end on a square of the opposite color compared to the starting square. This follows from the alternating pattern observed above. - After 63 moves (an odd number), the rook must land on a black square if it started on a white square. 5. **Checking the Colors of the Specific Squares:** - On standard chessboards, the bottom-left and top-right corners are the same color (both are typically white on a standard board). - This implies that starting on a white square (bottom-left) and after 63 moves, arriving on a white square (top-right) is impossible because, per step 4: - Moving 63 times from white must end on black, but the desired final position is white. 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, it is impossible for the rook to start at the bottom-left and end at the top-right while visiting each square exactly once due to the mismatch in color parity.

Consider the first three terms of each progression: - (a_1, a_1 p, a_1 p^2, ldots) - (b_1, b_1 q, b_1 q^2, ldots) 4.

This means each city's degree is 100. Furthermore, it is possible to travel between any two cities, indicating a connected graph. 2. **Scenario after One Road Closure**: Let's suppose a particular road AB (connecting city A and city B) is closed for repair. We need to prove that it is still possible to travel between any two cities in this country despite the closure of road AB. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume the contrary that upon closure of road AB, it becomes impossible to travel from city A to city B. This assumption implies that the connected graph becomes disconnected into at least two components. Let's denote the component containing city A by C_A and the component containing city B by C_B. 4. **Degree of Vertices**: Since each city initially had 100 roads, upon the closure of one road: - City A has 99 remaining roads. - City B has 99 remaining roads. If A and B now lie in separate components C_A and C_B, then: - The degree of A and B in their respective components C_A and C_B are both odd (99). 5. **Graph Component Analysis**: It follows that in component C_A: - City A has an odd degree (99). Similar reasoning shows that component C_B contains city B with an odd degree of 99. 6. **Contradiction with Graph Theory**: According to a fundamental property of graph theory (see Euler's theorem on degrees in graphs), the number of vertices with odd degrees in any graph must be even. 7. **Contradiction Proof**: In our components: - Component C_A has at least one vertex (city A) with an odd degree. - Component C_B has at least one vertex (city B) with an odd degree. Thus, component C_A and C_B must have an even number of vertices with odd degrees, which contradicts our previous finding of 99 odd degrees as it results in an odd count of odd degrees. 8. **Conclusion**: The contradiction indicates the assumption that A and B lie in separate components is false. Therefore, even after closing one road, the graph remains connected, and it is possible to travel between any two cities in the country.

When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates. We can express their work rates as fractions of the job done per hour.

[ text{Sum} = 2 times left( frac{15}{2} times (15 + 29) right) = 2 times (15 times 22) = 2 times 330 = 660 ] 4. **Constructing Heaps Backward:** Proceed by merging the smallest pairs of heaps, ensuring each step maintains the condition that no heap is more than twice the size of any other heaps: - Merge two heaps of size 15: [ 15 + 15 = 30 ] - Merge two heaps of size 16: [ 16 + 16 = 32 ] - Continue this process: [ 17 + 17 = 34, ldots, 29 + 29 = 58 ] After merging, we get heaps: [ {30, 32, 34, ldots, 58} quad (text{15 heaps}) ] 5. **Further Merging:** Continue the merging process: - Merge two smallest heaps: [ 30 + 32 = 62 ] - Continue with next pairs: [ 34 + 36 = 70, ldots, 54 + 58 = 112 ] Updating, we have the next set of heaps: [ {62, 70, 74, ldots, 112} quad (text{8 heaps}) ] 6. **Continue Merging to Reach Final Configuration**: Consistent merging as done previously: - Merge smallest pairs: [ 62 + 70 = 132 ] [ ldots, 106 + 112 = 218 ] Updating, we get heaps: [ {132, ldots, 218} quad (text{4 heaps}) ] 7. **Converging Towards One Heap:** Continue until we get one heap: [ 132 + 154 = 286 ] [ 180 + 218 = 398 ] Final step: [ 286 + 398 = 660 ] 8. **Conclusion:** The initial assumption and the logical steps to recombine heaps such that there are always fewer than twice the size of any heap ensure the problem's conditions are met. Thus, it confirms that the collection of 660 stones can indeed be divided into 30 heaps.

Since the hyperbola's standard equation is frac{x^{2}}{4}-y^{2}=1, the right vertex is at (2, 0). Next, we need to find the equations of the asymptotes. For a hyperbola in the form frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, the asymptotes are given by y=pmfrac{b}{a}x. In this case, a=2 and b=1, so the asymptotes are y=pmfrac{1}{2}x. Since the circle is tangent to the asymptotes at the right vertex, the radius of the circle is the distance from the vertex to the asymptote. The distance d from a point (x_1, y_1) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by d=frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. In this case, the distance from (2, 0) to y=frac{1}{2}x (or -frac{1}{2}x + y = 0) is r=frac{|-frac{1}{2}cdot2 + 0|}{sqrt{(-frac{1}{2})^2+1}}=frac{2}{sqrt{5}}. Therefore, the standard equation of the circle is (x-2)^2+y^2=(frac{2}{sqrt{5}})^2 or (x-2)^2+y^2=frac{4}{5}.

Each team is classified as either **GOOD** or **OK**. We need to determine if it is possible for every partition to contain either 3 **GOOD** teams or exactly 1 **GOOD** team, and if both options can be present. 2. **Construct an example**: Let's consider an example where we pick 3 specific students out of the 24. We will call a team **GOOD** if it contains an odd number of these 3 picked students, and **OK** if it contains an even number of these 3 picked students. 3. **Analyze the partitions**: - **Case 1**: Partition contains 3 **GOOD** teams and 1 **OK** team. - For this to happen, 3 teams must each contain an odd number of the 3 picked students, and 1 team must contain an even number of the 3 picked students. - Since the total number of picked students is 3 (an odd number), the sum of the number of picked students in the 4 teams must also be 3. - If 3 teams each have an odd number of picked students, the sum of these odd numbers is odd. Adding the number of picked students in the 4th team (which must be even) to this odd sum must result in an odd total, which is consistent with our requirement. - **Case 2**: Partition contains exactly 1 **GOOD** team and 3 **OK** teams. - For this to happen, 1 team must contain an odd number of the 3 picked students, and 3 teams must contain an even number of the 3 picked students. - Again, the total number of picked students is 3 (an odd number). - If 1 team has an odd number of picked students, the sum of this odd number and the even numbers in the other 3 teams must result in an odd total, which is consistent with our requirement. 4. **Verify both conditions**: - We have shown that it is possible to have a partition with 3 **GOOD** teams and 1 **OK** team. - We have also shown that it is possible to have a partition with exactly 1 **GOOD** team and 3 **OK** teams. Therefore, it is indeed possible for every partition to contain either 3 **GOOD** teams or exactly 1 **GOOD** team, and for both options to be present. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Prove that if a bounded convex curve has a finite number of corner points, then the sum of the exterior angles at all its corner points is less than or equal to 360^{circ}.

We consider the polygon X_1 X_2 ldots X_n that is inscribed in the curve ( K ). 2. **Comparison of Internal Angles with Inscribed Polygon:** For each angular point X_k of the curve ( K ), the internal angle of ( K ) at X_k is greater than or equal to the internal angle at X_k of the polygon X_1 X_2 ldots X_n (see Fig. 136). 3. **Implication on External Angles:** Consequently, the external angle of the curve ( K ) at X_k is less than or equal to the external angle at X_k of the polygon X_1 X_2 ldots X_n. 4. **Summation of External Angles for Polygon:** As it is known, the sum of the external angles of the polygon X_1 X_2 ldots X_n is: [ text{Sum of External Angles of } X_1 X_2 ldots X_n = 360^circ ] 5. **Conclusion of the First Part:** Thus, the sum of the external angles at the angular points of the convex curve ( K ) does not exceed the sum of the external angles of the polygon ( X_1 X_2 ldots X_n ), which is 360^circ. If ( K ) is not a convex polygon inscribed, we add a point and still the summation argument holds, finalizing less or equal than 360^circ in total.

This strict alternation is due to the arrangement where each cube of one color is adjacent (sharing a face) to cubes of the other color. 5. **Counting the Alternations:** Given the count from step 2, even if we start munching from a white cube: - We would then alternate 13 more times for black cubes, but end up on the 14th move on a white cube, running out of black cubes to proceed. 6. **Conclusion:** This alternating consumption pattern prevents the mouse from being able to finish all cubes since the current structure has an unequal number of black and white cubes. Thus, the mouse **cannot** eat the entire piece of cheese.

Let ( F(x) = prod (x - a_i) ) be one such irreducible factor of ( f_1(x) ), and let ( a ) be a root of ( F(x) ). 2. **Algebraic Integers**: In the number field ( mathbb{Q}(a) ), the numbers ( a ), ( b = f_2(a) ), and ( g_2(a) ) are algebraic integers. This is because: - ( a ) is an algebraic integer as its minimal polynomial has integer coefficients. - ( b ) and ( g_2(a) ) are algebraic integers because the algebraic integers in ( mathbb{Q}(a) ) form a ring. 3. **Unit in Number Field**: Since ( f_1 g_1 + f_2 g_2 = 1 ), evaluating at ( x = a ) gives ( f_1(a) g_1(a) + f_2(a) g_2(a) = 1 ).

The standard equation of the circle is therefore x^2 + (y - b)^2 = 25. Substituting point A(0, 3) into the equation, we get (3 - b)^2 = 25. Solving for b yields b = -2 or b = 8.

Thus, the standard equation of circle C is x^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25. boxed{x^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25} (2) Knowing that the center of circle C is (0, -2) and its radius is 5, we can assume the equation of line l can be written as y + 3 = k(x + 3), which can be rearranged to kx - y + 3k - 3 = 0. The perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to line l must be equal to the radius minus half of the chord length, represented by sqrt{radius^2 - (text{half chord length})^2}.

To do this, we need to prove that ( angle BPD = angle BID ). 4. By definition, ( BI ) is the angle bisector of ( angle ABC ), thereby splitting ( angle ABC ) into two equal halves. 5. Since ( D ) is placed on ( AB ) such that ( DB = BC ) and ( CE = BC ), triangle ( BDC ) is an isosceles triangle with ( DB = DC ). 6.

In a round-robin tournament where each player plays every other player twice, the total number of games ( G ) can be calculated using the formula: [ G = n cdot (n - 1) ] However, since each pair of players plays twice, we need to multiply the result by 2: [ G = n cdot (n - 1) cdot 2 ] We are given that ( G = 306 ), so we can set up the equation: [ 306 = n cdot (n - 1) cdot 2 ] Divide both sides by 2 to simplify: [ 153 = n cdot (n - 1) ] Now we need to find the integer value of ( n ) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error or by factoring. Let's try to factor 153 to see if we can find two consecutive integers that multiply to give us 153: [ 153 = 3 cdot 51 = 3 cdot 3 cdot 17 ] We can see that 17 and 9 are not consecutive integers, so we need to find another pair. Since 153 is an odd number, we can try to find the square root of 153 to get an approximate midpoint, and then test integers around that value. The square root of 153 is approximately 12.37, so we can start testing with ( n = 12 ) and ( n = 13 ): For ( n = 12 ): [ 12 cdot (12 - 1) = 12 cdot 11 = 132 ] This is too low. For ( n = 13 ): [ 13 cdot (13 - 1) = 13 cdot 12 = 156 ] This is too high. For ( n = 18 ): [ 18 cdot (18 - 1) = 18 cdot 17 = 306 ] This is the correct value.

During the solution process, we need to pay attention to the fact that a > 0 and b > 0. **Solution Steps** 1.

((alpha)) The condition (|x - 2.5| < 1.5): This can be rewritten as: [ -1.5 < x - 2.5 < 1.5 ] Adding (2.5) to each part of the inequality to isolate (x): [ 1 < x < 4 ] So, condition ((alpha)) is equivalent to (1 < x < 4). 2. ((beta)) The condition (sqrt{x^2 + x + 1}) is not an integer: For any integer (x), we need to check whether (sqrt{x^2 + x + 1}) can be an integer. This condition holds true for most values of (x) but we will specifically focus below. 3. ((gamma)) The condition (x) is an integer: This implies that (x) is one of the integers in the range found from condition ((alpha)): (x = 2) or (x = 3). 4. ((delta)) The condition (log_x 10 > 2): This implies: [ x^2 < 10 implies x < sqrt{10} approx 3.162 ] So, (x) must be less than (3.162). Since (x) is an integer (from ((gamma))), possible values are (x = 2) or (x = 3). **Conclusion:** To meet exactly three out of these four conditions for (x): - From conditions ((alpha)) and ((gamma)), (x) can only be (2) or (3). - Now, check these values with all four conditions: - For (x = 2): 1. ((alpha)) is satisfied because (1 < 2 < 4). 2. ((beta)) is satisfied because (sqrt{2^2 + 2 + 1} = sqrt{7}) is not an integer. 3. ((gamma)) is satisfied because (2) is an integer. 4. ((delta)) is satisfied because (log_2 10 > 2). - For (x = 3): 1. ((alpha)) is satisfied because (1 < 3 < 4). 2. ((beta)) is satisfied because (sqrt{3^2 + 3 + 1} = sqrt{13}) is not an integer. 3. ((gamma)) is satisfied because (3) is an integer. 4. ((delta)) is satisfied because (log_3 10 > 2). None of the values (x = 2) or (x = 3) exclude any conditions, thus the problem statement must be corrected in stating there are only three conditions, indicating one of these conditions inherently must be never satisfied for a true three-condition match. Since (x) must only match three: - (x) must miss the redundant provided we choose three distinct as exampled conflicting condition. Thus the missing condition is ((gamma)), boxed below.

This segment is viewed from points ( B ) and ( Q ) under an angle of (60^circ) since triangle ( A B C ) and ( P Q R ) are equilateral triangles. 3. By the property of cyclic quadrilaterals: if a quadrilateral is cyclic, then opposite angles are supplementary—that is, they sum to (180^circ). 4. Thus, the inscribed angle theorem states ( angle CRB = angle CQB = 60^circ ). Therefore, the points ( C, Q, B, R ) must lie on a circle. 5. Similarly, consider the points ( C, P, A, R ). The same logic applies: - ( angle CRA = angle CPA = 60^circ ), so, using the cyclic quadrilateral property, these points also lie on a circle. 6. Now, consider the angle relationships: - From the cyclic quadrilateral properties: [ angle APQ = angle APC = 180^circ - angle ARC = angle CRB ] Since ( angle CRB = 60^circ ), we then have: [ angle APC = 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ ] 7.

Let n geq 1 be an integer such that 9 divides 7^n + n^3. We need to determine the existence of such an integer n. 2. First, we will examine the possible values of n^3 mod 9. Since the cube of an integer modulo 9 can only be 0, -1, or 1, we have: [ n^3 equiv 0, -1, text{ or } 1 pmod{9} ] 3. Now, we need to ensure 7^n + n^3 equiv 0 pmod{9}, which implies: [ 7^n equiv -n^3 pmod{9} ] 4. Next, we observe that 7^n has a repeating cycle modulo 9 due to Euler's theorem, which states for any integer a and n, where gcd(a, n) = 1, then: [ a^{phi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n} ] Since phi(9) = 6, we have: [ 7^6 equiv 1 pmod{9} ] Thus: [ (7^3)^2 equiv 1 pmod{9} implies 7^3 equiv 1 pmod{9} ] So, the order of 7 modulo 9 is 3. 5. Given that 7^3 equiv 1 pmod{9}, for 2n to be congruent to 1 pmod{6}, it must be that: [ 7^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{9} ] 6.

If the tax rate was 6%, then what was the cost of the taxfree items?","completion":"Let's first calculate the amount Jerry spent on taxable purchases. If 30% of his total spending went on sales tax, then the remaining 70% was the actual cost of the taxable items. So, the cost of taxable items = 70% of Rs. 40 = (70/100) * 40 = 0.7 * 40 = Rs. 28 Now, we know that the sales tax rate is 6%. This means that the sales tax Jerry paid is 6% of the cost of the taxable items. Sales tax paid = 6% of Rs. 28 = (6/100) * 28 = 0.06 * 28 = Rs. 1.68 However, since we are dealing with currency and it is not practical to have a fraction of a cent, we should round the sales tax to the nearest whole number. In this case, we would round Rs. 1.68 to Rs. 2 (since the tax amount would be rounded up to the nearest rupee). Now, let's calculate the total amount Jerry spent on taxable items including the sales tax. Total amount spent on taxable items = Cost of taxable items + Sales tax = Rs. 28 + Rs. 2 = Rs. 30 Finally, we can find the cost of the tax-free items by subtracting the total amount spent on taxable items from the total amount Jerry spent.

If CC' is not a diameter of the circle, nor is BB', and finally not even AA' a diameter (but A, A', B, B', C, C' lie on a circle), then the hexagon Q_{1} Q_{2} Q_{3} Q_{4} Q_{5} Q_{6}, constructed as described so far, has 4, 2, or 0 pairs of consecutive sides forming right angles, respectively.","completion":"To address the problem, we need to show that within the given conditions for the hexagon Q_1 Q_2 Q_3 Q_4 Q_5 Q_6, specific consecutive sides are perpendicular to each other under various transformations and conditions. Part I: General Case **Step 1:** Let the rotation angle be varphi, and let the new vertices of the hexagon resulting from our transformation be denoted by Q_{1}^{prime}, Q_{2}^{prime}, ldots, Q_{6}^{prime}. **Step 2:** Construct the triangles P Q_{i} Q_{i}^{prime} for i = 1, 2, ldots, 6. Notice that each P Q_{i} Q_{i}^{prime} triangle is right-angled at Q_i. This means the transformation involves a rotation of angle varphi followed by a scaling by 1 / cos varphi about point P. **Step 3:** Because triangles P Q_{i} Q_{i}^{prime} are right-angled and angle Q_i'PQ_i = varphi, we find: [ P Q_{i}^{prime} = frac{P Q_{i}}{cos varphi} ] Thus, Q_{i}^{prime} can be analytically derived from Q_{i} by this transformation. **Step 4:** Note that this transformation (rotation by varphi and scaling by 1/cos varphi) is a similarity transformation. The resulting hexagon Q_{1}^{prime} Q_{2}^{prime} Q_{3}^{prime} Q_{4}^{prime} Q_{5}^{prime} Q_{6}^{prime} is similar to the original hexagon Q_{1} Q_{2} Q_{3} Q_{4} Q_{5} Q_{6}. Therefore, their corresponding angles are equal. **Step 5:** Since the angles are preserved, and the original construction ensured that any two consecutive sides of Q_{1} Q_{2} Q_{3} Q_{4} Q_{5} Q_{6} are perpendicular, it follows that the same property must hold for Q_{1}^{prime} Q_{2}^{prime} Q_{3}^{prime} Q_{4}^{prime} Q_{5}^{prime} Q_{6}^{prime}. Part II: Non-Convex (Hurkolt) Hexagon **Step 6:** In the original problem's proof, the convexity of the hexagon A B C A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} was not used. Therefore, the provided proof holds for a non-convex (hurkolt) hexagon. **Step 7:** Regardless of the self-intersection in the non-convex case, the procedure and angles are preserved. The Q_{i} vertices and perpendicular property rely only on the geometric construction involving the initial rotations and scalings. **Step 8:** Specifically, illustrate with an example (refer to Diagram 2 in the reference solution). Consider the angle omega = angle Q_1 Q_2 Q_3. Verify that omega is still a right angle by showing that the transformed segments maintain the angle properties. Part III: Diameters and Perpendicularity of Sides **Step 9:** To show that the exact count of perpendicular sides depends on the number of diameters among AA', BB', and CC': **Step 10:** Evaluate each potential diagonal: - When AA' is not a diameter, omega deviates from a right angle by delta, an angle dependent on the central angle alpha = angle AOA'', where O is the circle's center. - Similar logic applies for diagonals BB' and CC'. **Step 11:** This yields that for each diagonal not being a diameter, a pair of angles in the resulting hexagon Q_{1} Q_{2} Q_{3} Q_{4} Q_{5} Q_{6} deviates from the perpendicular. **Step 12:** As deduced: - If no diagonals among AA', BB', CC' are diameters, no adjacent pair of sides in Q is perpendicular. - For one diameter: Two pairs. - For two diameters: Four pairs. - For three diameters: All six pairs. # Conclusion: We have proven the required conditions for perpendicularity of consecutive sides in the constructed hexagon Q_1 Q_2 Q_3 Q_4 Q_5 Q_6, under specified transformations and when given conditions vary (convexity and diameters).

Therefore, ( AM = MC = frac{b}{2} ) because ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AC ). - Because ( AK ) is an angle bisector and also lies perpendicularly on ( BM ), it is also a height from ( A ) to ( BM ). 4. **Properties in ( triangle ABM ) and Congruency**: - Given that ( AK ) is both an angle bisector and a height, ( A ) must be equidistant from ( B ) and ( M ), implying that ( AM = AB ).

What is the minimum number of teams they can be divided into such that no team contains two individuals where one weighs twice as much as the other?","completion":"1. **Analyzing the Problem:** - There are 100 fat people, each weighing between 1 to 100 kg. - We need to divide them into the minimum number of teams such that no team contains a pair of people where one person weighs exactly twice as much as another. 2. **Key Assumption:** - Without loss of generality, assume that all 100 fat people have distinct weights. - This simplification is valid because if multiple people have the same weight, assigning them to any team does not violate the problem's condition. 3. **Identifying Constraints:** - For a given person of weight ( x ), there might exist another person of weight ( 2x ). - We need to ensure that any such pair (( x, 2x )) are not placed in the same team. 4. **Construct Linkages:** - Each person weighing ( x ) could potentially hold hands with the person weighing ( 2x ) (if such a person exists). This creates chains of weights where each link is double the previous one's weight. 5. **Graph Representation:** - Visualize this situation as a graph where each node represents a person's weight. - An edge connects two nodes ( x ) and ( 2x ) if such a pair exists and both weights are included in the group of 100 people. 6. **Disjoint Chains of Weights:** - The 100 people's weights can be mapped into disjoint chains. Each chain follows the form ( x, 2x, 4x, dots ) until the weights exceed 100 (the maximum given weight). - Each chain starts with the smallest possible weight and links to the next weight that is precisely double the previous one until no further valid weight exists in the group. 7. **Coloring the Chains:** - To avoid placing any two connected nodes (weights) in the same team, we can use a simple two-coloring method (analogous to a bipartite graph coloring): - Assign one color to the starting weight of each chain. - Alternate the color for each successive weight in the same chain. 8. **Final Team Division:** - The colors represent the teams. Thus, all weights colored with one color (say, red) form Team 1, and those with the other color (say, blue) form Team 2. 9. **Conclusion:** - By following this bipartite coloring approach, we ensure that no two people in the same team satisfy the problematic condition (one person’s weight is exactly twice the other’s weight).

This smaller grid will help us construct a structured way to block the first player. - We pair squares in this 10×10 grid such that any potential line of 11 adjacent squares will necessarily include at least one of these pairs. 3. **Constructing the grid and identifying pairs**: - We define pairs of squares within the 10x10 grid in such a way that each pair appears in any line of length 11. - Number the cells in the 10×10 grid systematically or according to a specific pattern.

She spent 30% on food, which is 30. She spent 30% on other items, which is 30. Now, she paid a 4% tax on clothing, which is 4% of 40 = 1.60. Since there is no tax on food, the tax on food is 0. The total tax she paid is 4% of the total amount spent before taxes, which is 4% of 100 = 4. We already know the tax on clothing is 1.60, and the tax on food is 0, so the tax on other items must make up the difference to reach the total tax of 4.

We'll use this relationship to express a_2, a_4, and a_6 in terms of a_5, a_7, and a_9, respectively: a_4 = frac{a_5}{3}, a_2 = frac{a_3}{3} = frac{frac{a_4}{3}}{3} = frac{a_5}{3^2}, a_6 = frac{a_7}{3}. Now, let's use the given that a_2 + a_4 + a_6 = 9: frac{a_5}{3^2} + frac{a_5}{3} + frac{a_7}{3} = 9. Since a_7 = frac{a_8}{3} = frac{frac{a_9}{3}}{3} = frac{a_9}{3^2}, we replace a_7 in the equation: frac{a_5}{3^2} + frac{a_5}{3} + frac{a_9}{3^2} = 9.

A multiple of 15 must be divisible by both 3 and 5. 2. Since the sum must be divisible by 3, the sum of the 4 prime numbers must have a digital root that is a multiple of 3. 3. Since the sum must be divisible by 5, the last digit of the sum must be either 0 or 5. Let's start by listing the prime numbers greater than 10 and less than 50 for a start (as we are looking for the least such integer): 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 Now, we need to find a combination of 4 of these primes that when added together give us a number that ends in 0 or 5 (to be divisible by 5) and whose sum of digits is a multiple of 3 (to be divisible by 3). Let's start by trying to find a combination that ends in 5 or 0. We can quickly see that since all primes greater than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, we will need to have a combination where the last digits add up to 10 or 20 (since we are looking for the sum to be the smallest, we aim for 10). One way to get a last digit of 0 is to have the last digits of the primes be 1, 9, 3, and 7 in any order. Let's try to find the smallest such primes: 11 (ends in 1), 19 (ends in 9), 13 (ends in 3), and 17 (ends in 7).

If b is -1, then c must be 1 so that the ratio between them stays the same, because c = b cdot left(frac{c}{b}right). Knowing the values of b and c, we can find the first term a and the fourth term d using the property of geometric sequences.

This means that when B paints any k times k square on one side, A can always find a k times k counterpart on the other side. 7. **Winning Condition**: Since the whole procedure ensures that the grid remains symmetric after each pair of moves, when B is left to make their last move, A will always have a final mirrored cell, the last uncolored cell. Hence, A will always make the final move, satisfying the win condition. # Conclusion: By using the mirror symmetry around the axis between columns 47 and 48, A ensures a winning strategy. Thus, if both players play optimally, A will always win the game. boxed{text{A has a winning strategy.}}"},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms denoted as S_n, it is known that S_1, S_3, and S_2 form an arithmetic sequence. 1.

According to the problem, the Sempoaltec tribe can make exchanges with the following individuals: - **Cortes**: 1 gold ingot ( + ) 1 pearl ( rightarrow ) 1 glass bead - **Montezuma**: 1 gold ingot ( + ) 1 glass bead ( rightarrow ) 1 pearl - **Totonacs**: 1 pearl ( + ) 1 glass bead ( rightarrow ) 1 gold ingot 3. Let's analyze the parity (even or odd properties): - The number of gold ingots initially is 24, which is even. - The number of pearls initially is 26, which is even. - The number of glass beads initially is 25, which is odd. 4. To understand how the exchanges affect the counts, we need to track the parity of each object after any exchange. We can proceed case by case for each exchange: - Exchange with **Cortes**: [ G rightarrow G - 1 quad (text{even} - 1 = text{odd}) ] [ P rightarrow P - 1 quad (text{even} - 1 = text{odd}) ] [ B rightarrow B + 1 quad (text{odd} + 1 = text{even}) ] - Exchange with **Montezuma**: [ G rightarrow G - 1 quad (text{odd} - 1 = text{even}) ] [ P rightarrow P + 1 quad (text{odd} + 1 = text{even}) ] [ B rightarrow B - 1 quad (text{even} - 1 = text{odd}) ] - Exchange with **Totonacs**: [ G rightarrow G + 1 quad (text{even} + 1 = text{odd}) ] [ P rightarrow P - 1 quad (text{even} - 1 = text{odd}) ] [ B rightarrow B - 1 quad (text{odd} - 1 = text{even}) ] 5. Observe that regardless of the exchanges performed, the combined parity of the objects will always result in one of them being odd and the others even if they remain after sufficient exchanges. 6. In every case, the total parity system's consistency is kept, meaning exactly one of the categories must have an odd number after a sufficient number of exchanges. Judging by conversions, it is ultimately deduced that given an odd item consistently remains, given that there must be a specific item in surplus and will prevail in parity check terms. 7. Here, since initial conditions and ongoing exchanges, beads or corrected details reveal as the odd counted item ends if exchanges stabilize.

The larger cube's face is painted with red color and the entire assembly is taken apart. 23 small cubes are found with no paints on them. How many of unit cubes have at least one face that is painted red?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of the larger cube formed by the smaller 1-inch cubes. Since 23 small cubes have no paint on them, these cubes must have been in the interior of the larger cube, where no paint could reach them. The number of small cubes in the interior can be calculated by taking the total number of cubes in the larger cube and subtracting the number of cubes on the surface (which would have at least one face painted). Let's denote the side length of the larger cube as ( n ) (in terms of the number of small cubes). The total number of small cubes in the larger cube would then be ( n^3 ). The interior cubes would be arranged in a smaller cube with side length ( n - 2 ) (since we remove one layer of cubes from each side). The number of interior cubes would be ( (n - 2)^3 ). We are given that there are 23 interior cubes, so we have: [ (n - 2)^3 = 23 ] Since 23 is a prime number and cannot be expressed as a cube of a whole number, we need to find the smallest cube number greater than 23, which is ( 2^3 = 8 ). This means that ( n - 2 = 2 ) and ( n = 4 ). Now, we can calculate the number of cubes with at least one face painted. The total number of cubes in the larger cube is ( n^3 = 4^3 = 64 ). The number of cubes with no paint is 23, as given.

The player who makes the first move aims to maximize the number of equations that have two distinct roots at the end of the game, while their opponent aims to minimize this number. What is the best possible outcome that the first player can achieve regardless of the second player's moves?","completion":"To determine the best outcome for the first player, we analyze the game step-by-step. 1. **General Setup**: The first player aims to maximize the number of quadratic equations from the given form x^2 + ldots x + ldots = 0 that have two distinct roots. The second player will aim to minimize this number. The numbers used are from the natural set 1, 2, ldots, 10, and each number is used exactly once. 2. **Key Observation**: A quadratic equation x^2 + px + q = 0 has two distinct real roots if and only if the discriminant (D = p^2 - 4q) is positive. 3. **Strategy for the First Player**: To achieve at least three equations with two distinct roots, the first player can employ the following strategy: - Make the first three moves by inserting the largest available numbers in place of the linear coefficient (p) in three different equations. - The rationale is that by placing large values for p, it is easier to maintain a positive discriminant (D) when the second player fills in smaller q values. 4. **Mathematical Implementation**: - Suppose the first player places the three largest numbers available to him in the positions of p: - First move: p_1 = 10 - Second move: p_2 = 9 - Third move: p_3 = 8 - After these moves, the remaining numbers are 1 through 7 (for simplicity, let's assume these are untouched by now). 5. **Ensuring Positive Discriminant**: - Let's consider one of the equations: x^2 + 10x + q = 0 by the third round. For the discriminant to be positive, we need: [ D_1 = 10^2 - 4q > 0 implies 100 - 4q > 0 implies q < 25 ] Since q is a single-digit natural number less than or equal to 10, it's always true that q < 25. - Similarly, by the time the second player adds q, the following inequalities hold: [ D_2 = 9^2 - 4q > 0 implies 81 - 4q > 0 implies q < 20.25 ] [ D_3 = 8^2 - 4q > 0 implies 64 - 4q > 0 implies q < 16 ] 6. **Conclusion**: - Given the constraints and the rules of the game, to foil this strategy (making more than three equations having two distinct roots) in a simple evaluation process, the first player's strategic decision leads to results where at least three equations (x^2 + 10x + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/x^2 + 9x + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7, etc.) indeed ensures at least three having two distinct roots. Hence, the first player’s best achievable result without considering the second player’s interventions would be ensuring three quadratic equations among the given type form have two different roots.

Let's denote a parent as **left parent** (LP) if their child is standing to their left, and as **right parent** (RP) if their child is standing to their right. 2. We need to prove that among the central 111 people in the row, there is at least one child. 3. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all the central 111 people are parents. 4. Since there are 111 parents, at least one side (either left parents or right parents) must contain more than half (i.e., more than frac{111}{2} = 55.5) of these parents. Hence, there must be at least 56 parents on one side. Let's assume without loss of generality that there are at least 56 left parents. 5. Each left parent has their child standing to their left. Therefore, the 56 children of these left parents must all be among the first 111 people in the row (because a left parent has at least a child before them in the sequence). 6. Similarly, each of these 56 left parents have their spouses (the other parent) also standing among the first 111 people since the spouse (whether LP or RP) must also be counted among the first 111 parents we assumed initially. 7. Thus, we have 56 children and at least 56 parents (spouses of the LPs) in the first 111 people. This makes at least 112 people in the first 111 positions, which is a contradiction. 8. A similar argument applies if we assume there are at least 56 right parents among the central 111 people. The reasoning would lead to the same contradiction because there would have to be 56 children and their corresponding spouses (at least 56 RPs) among the last 111 positions, leading to a similar impossible scenario. 9. Hence, our assumption that all central 111 people are parents leads to a contradiction. Therefore, it must be that not all of the central 111 people are parents. Conclusion: Thus, among the central 111 people, there is at least one child. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The number of students in Alex's class is more than 100 and fewer than 150, and is 2 less than a multiple of 4, 3 less than a multiple of 5, and 4 less than a multiple of 6.

Find the equation of line l.","completion":"First, let’s analyze the given parallel lines. We know that parallel lines have the same slope. Hence, we can derive the slope from either l_1 or l_2. Rewriting l_1: x + y + 1 = 0 in slope-intercept form y = -x - 1, we can see that the slope is -1. Hence, the line l that we are looking for must also have a slope of -1 since it is cut by these two parallel lines. Let the equation of line l be in the form y - y_0 = m(x - x_0), where (x_0, y_0) is a point on the line and m is the slope. Since the line l passes through the point P(3, 1) and has a slope of -1, plugging these values into the equation, we obtain: y - 1 = -1(x - 3). Simplifying, we get the equation of the line l as: y = -x + 3 + 1, which is: y = -x + 4. This is an equation of the line that passes through point P and has a slope of -1. However, we must verify that this line also satisfies the condition that the line segment cut by l_1 and l_2 is 5 units long. To do that, we find the points of intersection of line l with l_1 and l_2 and then calculate the distance between these points. The intersection point with l_1 is found by solving the system: begin{align} l: y &= -x + 4, l_1: x + y &= -1. end{align} Substituting y from the first equation into the second equation, we have: x - x + 4 = -1 Rightarrow x = frac{5}{2}. Therefore, the corresponding y-coordinate is: y = -frac{5}{2} + 4 = frac{3}{2}. So, the point of intersection with l_1 is left(frac{5}{2}, frac{3}{2}right). Using the same method, we find the intersection point with l_2 by solving the system: begin{align} l: y &= -x + 4, l_2: x + y &= -6. end{align} Substituting y from the first equation into the second equation, we have: x - x + 4 = -6 Rightarrow x = 5.

Pipe A fills the cistern in 10 hours, so its rate is 1/10 of the cistern per hour. Pipe B fills the cistern in 12 hours, so its rate is 1/12 of the cistern per hour. Pipe C fills the cistern in 20 hours, so its rate is 1/20 of the cistern per hour. Pipe D empties the cistern in 15 hours, so its rate is -1/15 of the cistern per hour (negative because it empties the cistern). Pipe E empties the cistern in 30 hours, so its rate is -1/30 of the cistern per hour (negative because it empties the cistern). Now, let's add these rates together to find the overall rate when all pipes are open: Overall rate = (1/10) + (1/12) + (1/20) - (1/15) - (1/30) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 12, 20, 15, and 30 is 60. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60: Overall rate = (6/60) + (5/60) + (3/60) - (4/60) - (2/60) Now we can add the fractions: Overall rate = (6 + 5 + 3 - 4 - 2) / 60 Overall rate = (14 - 6) / 60 Overall rate = 8 / 60 So the overall rate is 8/60 of the cistern per hour.

To do this, consider all the outer vertices of the shapes ( M ) and ( M' ) combined. 3. **Labeling and Coloring Vertices:** Each outer vertex belongs to one or more convex polygons. Suppose the convex polygon with the smallest index containing this vertex is ( i ). We color this vertex with the color corresponding to the index ( i ). 4. **Inductive Argument:** To transform the problem, we apply the following lemma: **Lemma:** Suppose there are ( m (geq 2) ) points on a circle, each colored with one of ( k ) colors, such that no two adjacent points have the same color. Further, if points ( A ) and ( B ) are colored the same, and points ( C ) and ( D ) are colored the same, then the line segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) do not intersect.

If all ( m ) points are differently colored, this means ( k_m = m ), and since ( m geq leftlfloor frac{m+3}{2} rightrfloor ), our lemma holds trivially. ii.

If one smaller arc contains ( m_1 ) points (such that ( 2 leq m_1 leq m-2 )), the remaining points fall on the other arc ( (2 leq m - m_1 leq m - 2) ). 7. **Combining Inductive Results:** Since ( A ) and ( B ) are in different arcs, according to our setup and selection of ( l ), all remaining pairs of similarly colored points abide by the same non-intersecting property, confirming the inequality: [ k_m geq k_{m_1} + k_{m-m_1} - 1 geq leftlfloor frac{m_1 + 3}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m-m_1+3}{2} rightrfloor - 1 ] This ultimately simplifies to at least ( leftlfloor frac{m+3}{2} rightrfloor ), affirming the lemma for ( m ). 8. **Application to the Problem:** Given that each color corresponds to a convex polygon in ( M cup M' ), and noting that ( M cup M' ) has ( 2n ) vertices, from the lemma, the minimum number of convex polygons must be at least ( leftlfloor frac{2n + 3}{2} rightrfloor = n + 1 ). **Conclusion:** [ boxed{n+1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given tan alpha=3, find the value of dfrac {2sin alphacos alpha}{sin alpha +3cos alpha }.

We are given that in a competition of n rounds (n > 1), a total of m medals are distributed. The distribution pattern is as follows: - In the 1st round, 1 medal is awarded plus frac{1}{7} of the remaining m-1 medals. - In the 2nd round, 2 medals are awarded plus frac{1}{7} of the remaining medals, and so on. - This continues until the n-th round where exactly n medals are awarded, and no medals remain. Let's denote the number of remaining medals after k rounds as a_k. The governing equation for a_k in terms of a_{k-1} is: [ a_k = a_{k-1} - left[ k + frac{1}{7} (a_{k-1} - k) right] ] Simplifying, we get: [ a_k = frac{6}{7} a_{k-1} - frac{6}{7} k ] With the initial condition: [ a_0 = m ] Given that after n rounds, no medals remain, we have: [ a_n = 0 ] We can further transform the series into a more manageable form. We substitute the recurrent relation: [ a_k + 6k - 36 = frac{6}{7} left[ a_{k-1} + 6(k-1) - 36 right] ] Consequently, we get: [ a_n + 6n - 36 = (a_0 - 36) left( frac{6}{7} right)^n ] Given a_n = 0, the equation becomes: [ left( m - 36 right) left( frac{6}{7} right)^n = 6n - 36 ] Solving for m and substituting the values into the equation, given that: [ m - 36 = 6n left( frac{7^n}{6^{n-1}} right) ] The only feasible integer solutions for n and m (where n > 1 and m is a natural number) are: [ n = 6 ] [ m = 36 ] Thus, the competition includes 6 rounds and a total of 36 medals were distributed.

Let the total number of ways to paint n sectors be denoted by a_n.

Depending on whether S_n matches or differs from S_1, we have recursion into subproblems. Given these connections, the total combinations are: [ a_n = 3 times 2^{n-1} - a_{n-1} ] Let p_n = frac{a_n}{2^n}, we find: [ p_n = 1 - left( -frac{1}{2} right)^{n-1} ] Substituting we get: [ a_n = 2^n left( 1 - (-frac{1}{2})^{n-1} right) ] Thus: [ a_n = 2^n + (-1)^n cdot 2 ] Therefore, the total number of coloring ways is: [ a_n = 2^n + (-1)^n cdot 2 ] Conclusion for part (1): boxed{(6, 36)} Conclusion for part (2): boxed{2^n + (-1)^n cdot 2}"},{"prompt":"the propositions of the form ¬p, p∧q, p∨q, if p∨q is true, p∧q is false, and ¬p is true, then the truth values of p and q are p , q .","completion":"Given that \\"p∨q\\" is true, it indicates that at least one of p or q is true.

Clearly, (b - a)^2 is already a perfect square since b, a are integers. 8. **Identifying Constraints on k^2**: Next, 1 + k^2 must be a perfect square.

The derivative, denoted as f'(x), is obtained using the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^{n-1}. So, for the given function, f(x) = ax^3 + 4x^2 + 3x, the derivative with respect to x is f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ax^3) + frac{d}{dx}(4x^2) + frac{d}{dx}(3x). Using the power rule, we get: f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 8x + 3. Since we are given that f'(1) = 2, we can substitute x with 1 in the derivative: f'(1) = 3a(1)^2 + 8(1) + 3 = 3a + 8 + 3 = 2.

We use the formula relating the radius of the circumscribed circle to the sides of the triangle, which in this case simplifies due to the given angle angle ACB=30^{circ}: [2r = frac{AB}{sin angle ACB} = frac{2}{sin 30^{circ}} = frac{2}{frac{1}{2}} = 4] From this, we deduce that r = frac{4}{2} = 2.

To find the radius R of the circumscribed sphere, we use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the circumscribed circle, the radius of the sphere, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane ABC: [R = sqrt{d^2 + r^2} = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{1 + 4} = sqrt{5}] Finally, the surface area S of the circumscribed sphere is calculated using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, S = 4pi R^2: [S = 4pi (sqrt{5})^2 = 4pi cdot 5 = 20pi] Therefore, the surface area of the circumscribed sphere of the triangular pyramid P-ABC is boxed{20pi}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"There are some pairs of socks and 2 socks are worn from that such that the pair of socks worn are not of the same pair.

If we have n pairs of socks, then we have a total of 2n individual socks. We want to find out how many different pairs of socks we can form where the two socks are not from the same pair. For the first sock, we have 2n choices (since we can pick any sock). For the second sock, we have 2n - 1 choices (since we can pick any sock except the one that matches the first sock). However, since we are looking for pairs, we have to divide by 2 to account for the fact that the order in which we pick the socks doesn't matter (sock A with sock B is the same as sock B with sock A). So the number of different non-matching pairs we can form is: (2n * (2n - 1)) / 2 We are given that this number is 6: (2n * (2n - 1)) / 2 = 6 Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2n * (2n - 1) = 12 Expanding the left side: 4n^2 - 2n = 12 Moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero: 4n^2 - 2n - 12 = 0 Dividing the entire equation by 2 to simplify: 2n^2 - n - 6 = 0 Now we can factor the quadratic equation: (2n + 3)(n - 2) = 0 Setting each factor equal to zero gives us two possible solutions for n: 2n + 3 = 0 or n - 2 = 0 Solving for n in each case: n = -3/2 (not a valid solution since we can't have a negative number of pairs of socks) or n = 2 So the number of pairs of socks is n = boxed{2} ."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
