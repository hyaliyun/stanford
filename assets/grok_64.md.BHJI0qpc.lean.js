Then, f'(x) = frac{1-x}{x^{3}}. Thus, when 0 < x < 1, f'(x) > 0, and when x > 1, f'(x) < 0. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0,1) and decreasing on (1, +infty).

This understanding is crucial in identifying fraudulent activities. 2. **Immediate Reaction and Common Fraudulent Outcomes**: - **Immediate Loss of Funds**: If you respond to such messages by calling the provided number, there is a risk of funds being directly withdrawn from your bank account during the call. - **Phishing for Card Details**: Scammers might pose as bank officials to acquire sensitive information such as the card number, expiration date, and CVV code. This often leads to unauthorized transactions. 3. **Verification Steps**: - **Do Not Respond Hastily**: Resist the urge to quickly reply or call the number provided in the SMS. - **Verify the Source**: - Compare the received message with previous legitimate messages received from your bank. - Note that Sberbank, for example, only uses the short number 900 for sending SMS notifications, not any other long numbers. Scammers often mimic real contacts by slightly altering the number. 4. **Check the Sender’s Number**: Be cautious about the sender’s number. Fraudulent messages often come from numbers similar to official ones but include slight variations. For banks like Sberbank, the legitimate sender number is 900. Any deviations should be treated with suspicion. 5. **Reaching Out to the Bank**: - **Use Official Contact Information**: Call the customer service number listed on the back of your bank card. This ensures you are reaching out to a legitimate representative. - **Inquire with a Bank Representative**: Provide details of the SMS to the bank official and confirm whether it was legitimately sent by the bank. 6. **Notify the Bank of Suspicious Activity**: Inform the bank about the fraudulent attempt. Some banks have started programs to reward individuals who report fraud attempts, contributing to the database of known scams. # Conclusion: In summary, the steps to handle a suspicious SMS about a bank card being blocked include: 1. Not reacting hastily. 2. Verifying the sender's number against known legitimate numbers. 3. Calling the official customer service number found on the bank card. 4. Consulting with a bank representative to confirm the legitimacy of the message. 5. Reporting the fraudulent attempt to the bank. Adopting these measures helps protect against potential fraud and ensures that responses are made only to legitimate communications. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"What is the standard equation for a circle with a center at (3,4) and a radius of sqrt{3}?

Since 10 is composed of the prime factors 2 and 5, we need to count the number of times 2 and 5 appear in the prime factorization of 170!. The limiting factor will be the number of 5s, as there will always be more 2s than 5s in the factorization of a factorial. Let's count the number of 5s in the prime factorization of 170!: - There is one 5 in every multiple of 5, so we start by dividing 170 by 5: 170 / 5 = 34. This means there are 34 multiples of 5 up to 170. - However, multiples of 25 (5^2) contribute an additional 5 to the factorization, so we must also count these: 170 / 25 = 6. This means there are 6 additional 5s from the multiples of 25. - Multiples of 125 (5^3) contribute yet another 5, so we count these as well: 170 / 125 = 1. This means there is 1 additional 5 from the multiples of 125. Adding these up, we get 34 (from the multiples of 5) + 6 (from the multiples of 25) + 1 (from the multiples of 125) = 41. Therefore, the largest possible value of n for which 170! / 10^n is an integer is boxed{41,} as there are 41 factors of 5 in 170!, and thus at least 41 factors of 10 (since there are more than enough factors of 2 to pair with the factors of 5 to make factors of 10)."},{"prompt":"Vanya wrote several prime numbers, using exactly once each digit from 1 to 9.

First, let's sum all the digits from 1 to 9: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] This confirms that the total sum of any combination of these digits will always be a permutation leading to the same sum of digits, hence total sum modulo 9 remains constant. Next, we search for a set of prime numbers created by using every digit once such that the resulting sum is less than 225.

Thus, the angle (angle BOC) or equivalently (angle EOD) satisfies: [ angle BOC = angle EOD = 180^circ - angle BDE - angle CED ] [ angle BOC = angle EOD = 180^circ - 50^circ - 30^circ = 100^circ ] 4. We denote diameters (BB') and (CC') wherein (angle BOC = 100^circ). Given that (O) is the circumcenter of (triangle ABC) and (A) moves along the arc (B'C'), the point (A) is fixed. 5. Let points (D) and (E) be the intersection points of extended lines (BO) and (CO) with (AC) and (AB) respectively. 6. As per the problem, when point (A) changes position along (B'C'), (OE) increases and (OD) decreases impacting angles (OED) and (ODE). Suppose these conditions reach a specific point where: [ angle CED = angle OED = 30^circ quad text{and} quad angle BDE = angle ODE = 50^circ ] 7. Supporting our angles, we validate the required properties within a triangle (ABC) with angles (angle A = 50^circ), (angle B = 70^circ), and (angle C = 60^circ). 8. By using a regular 18-gon, we illustrate that choosing (triangle A_2A_{14}A_9) aligns structurally and verifies the bisectors (DE) intersect appropriately confirming: [ angle BDE = 50^circ, quad angle CED = 30^circ ] 9. Conclusively, the triangle (ABC) maintains: [ angle A = 50^circ, quad angle B = 70^circ, quad angle C = 60^circ ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{angle A = 50^circ, angle B = 70^circ, angle C = 60^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a triangle with a perimeter of 2s, an incircle with radius varrho, and one angle alpha.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Angle at Vertex (A):** According to the construction, the angle at vertex (A) is (alpha). This is directly specified in the construction, so: [ angle BAC = alpha. ] 2. **Inradius ( varrho):** We need to show that the center (O) of the inscribed circle in ( triangle ABC ) (incenter) is at a distance (varrho) from (BC). Given that the segments from (A) to the tangency points on the sides are (s_1), we can sum up the lengths as follows: [ AR + RB = s_1 quad text{and} quad AQ + QC = s_1, ] where ( R ) and ( Q ) are the points of tangency on sides ( AC ) and ( AB ) respectively. The length of (BC) is (BC = s - s_1). Thus the total perimeter of ( triangle ABC ) is: [ AB + BC + CA = AR + RB + BQ + QC + BC = s_1 + s_1 + (s - s_1) + s_1 = 2s. ] 3. **Verification that (O) is the Incenter:** Since ( D ) is the midpoint of the arc ( overarc{BC} ) not containing ( A ), ( overarc{BD} ) and ( overarc{DC} ), ( D ) splits ( angle BAC ) into two equal angles. Hence: [ angle ABD = angle DAC. ] In other words, ( AD ) is the internal angle bisector of ( angle BAC ). Also, using properties of the incenter and angle bisectors: [ angle BOC = 180^circ - frac{alpha}{2} quad text{(being an angle between two tangents)}. ] In the quadrilateral ( ABDC ): [ angle BDC = 180^circ - alpha, ] leads to: [ angle BOC = 90^circ + frac{alpha}{2}. ] Consequently, the angles agree and hence ( O ) is the incenter of ( triangle ABC ). This establishes that the radius of the inscribed circle (the inradius) is indeed ( varrho ). 4. **Perimeter of Triangle ( triangle ABC )**: By construction, the given semi-perimeter is ( s ).

Let these perpendiculars intersect ( l ) at points ( P_i ). - Denote the lengths of these perpendiculars as ( d_i ). 3. **Generalize for Any Regular Polygon:** - Without loss of generality, assume that the line ( l ) passes through the center ( O ) of the polygon (since the result should hold for any orientation of ( l )). - Construct lines through ( P_i ) parallel to ( l ) and passing through the vertices ( A_i ). Let this parallel line intersect the circle ( O A ) (the circumcircle of the regular polygon) at points denoted ( A_i' ). 4. **Straightforward Geometric Relationships:** - The key insight here is recognizing that the perpendicular distance from any vertex ( A_i ) to the line ( l ) can be related to the radii of the circumscribed circle. - Due to symmetry of the regular polygon about its centre ( O ), the sum of the perpendicular distances squared from vertices ( A_i ) to ( l ) would be invariant to rotations or translations of ( l ). 5. **Leveraging Symmetry:** - Exploit the fact that these perpendicular distances are projections of equal radial lengths onto the line ( l ). - More formally, let ( R ) be the radius of the circumscribed circle around the polygon. - Each perpendicular is, due to symmetry, an equal contributing part to the sum of distances squared. 6. **Sum of Squares Calculation:** - The sum of the squares of these perpendicular distances ( d_i ) from each vertex ( A_i ) of the regular polygon to the line ( l ) is calculated by: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2 ] 7. **Final Conclusion:** - Using the symmetry and the equal spacing of vertices, the sum of perpendicular distances squared will be constant for any orientation of line ( l ). - This constant sum can be simplified and shown to be a function of the radius ( R ) of the circumscribed circle, but crucially it remains invariant to the direction of line ( l ).

Since both (A) and (B) are divisible by 9, the difference ( |A - B| ) must also be divisible by 9 (because the difference of two multiples of 9 is also a multiple of 9). 4. **Checking Larger Common Divisors:** To prove that 9 is the greatest divisor, suppose there is a larger common divisor, say (d).

Therefore, the quantity a^2-a+1 must equal either 3 or a, as these are the other elements in set A. Let's consider both equations separately. First, consider the equation a^2 - a + 1 = 3. This simplifies to a^2 - a - 2 = 0, which factors to (a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. Thus, a = 2 or a = -1 are possible solutions. Now let's consider the second case: a^2 - a + 1 = a.

If the manuscript fee is more than 4000 yuan, an 11% tax is levied on the entire manuscript fee. Take the tax paid of 420 yuan; we look at the possible manuscript fee in each bracket: - If the manuscript fee were below 4000 yuan, the tax paid would be 14% of (manuscript fee - 800).

Let's examine each option based on the tax brackets and see which one matches the tax paid: **For the manuscript fee below 4000 yuan:** 420 = 0.14 * (manuscript fee - 800) manuscript fee - 800 = frac{420}{0.14} manuscript fee - 800 = 3000 manuscript fee = 3000 + 800 manuscript fee = 3800 **For the manuscript fee above 4000 yuan:** 420 = 0.11 * manuscript fee manuscript fee = frac{420}{0.11} manuscript fee = 3818.18... However, this value does not match any of the given options and also it's not a logical condition since the manuscript fee over 4000 yuan would result in a tax greater than 420 yuan. Therefore, the correct answer is when the manuscript fee is 3800 yuan, which is on the bracket more than 800 yuan but not more than 4000 yuan.

Similarly, the operation ( [underline{lim}] , A_{n} ) is defined as: [ x in [varliminf lim] A_{n}, ] if every neighborhood of the point ( x ) contains common points with ( A_{n} ) from some finite ( n = n(x) ) onwards. Investigate the relationship between ( [overline{lim}] , A_{n} ) and ( overline{lim} , A_{n} ).

(f) Note that, generally speaking, the existence of ( F = [lim] F_{n} ) does not imply that ( F_{n} rightarrow F ) in the metric ( d ). However, if the space ( (E, rho) ) is compact, meaning that every infinite sequence of elements of ( E ) contains a convergent subsequence in ( E ), then ( [lim] F_{n} ) exists if and only if the limit ( F ) of the sets ( F_{n} ) in the metric ( d ) exists, and in this case ( F = [lim] F_{n} ). (g) Let ( mu ) be a finite measure on ( (E, mathscr{E}) ), where ( mathscr{E} ) is the Borel sigmaalgebra, and ( F_{n} rightarrow F ) in ( (mathscr{F}, d) ). Show that [ lim_{n} mu(F_{n}) leqslant mu(F). ]","completion":"(a) To understand why the axioms of a distance are not satisfied by ( m(A, B) ) and ( M(A, B) ), we need to analyze these candidates in comparison to the properties that a metric (d) in a metric space should satisfy: 1. ( d(A, B) geq 0 ) (Non-negativity) 2. ( d(A, B) = 0 ) if and only if ( A = B ) 3. ( d(A, B) = d(B, A) ) (Symmetry) 4. ( d(A, C) leq d(A, B) + d(B, C) ) (Triangle inequality) 1. **For (m(A, B)):** - Non-negativity: By definition, (m(A, B)) is the infimum of (rho(a, b)) for (a in A) and (b in B), which is non-negative since distances (rho) are non-negative. - ( m(A, B) = 0 ): This might imply that the infimum distance is zero, which does not necessarily mean ( A = B ). - Symmetry: ( m(A, B) neq m(B, A) ) necessarily since the sequences attaining these infima can differ. - Triangle inequality: It does not satisfy the triangle inequality in all cases as the infima do not consider intermediate points. 2. **For (M(A, B)):** - Non-negativity: Similarly, the supremum of the distances is non-negative. - ( M(A, B) = 0 ): This would mean the supremum distance is zero, which only happens when ( A = B ). - Symmetry: ( M(A, B)) is symmetric because the supremum considers maxima, which is indifferent to the order of sets (A) and (B). - Triangle inequality: However, it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality for similar intermediate constraints. Thus, neither (m(A, B)) nor (M(A, B)) satisfy all the axioms of distance metrics. (b) To establish the inequalities [ m(A, B) leq delta(A, B) leq M(A, B) ] we recall the definition of ( delta(A, B) ): [ delta(A, B) = inf { varepsilon : B subseteq A^varepsilon } ] 1. **Showing (m(A, B) leq delta(A, B)):** - If (varepsilon geq m(A, B)), then for every (b in B), there exists (a in A) such that (rho(a, b) < m(A, B)), so (b in A^varepsilon) by definition. - Hence, (delta(A, B))—the infimum of such (varepsilon)—at least equals (m(A, B)). 2. **Showing (delta(A, B) leq M(A, B)):** - Given that (varepsilon geq sup_{a in A, b in B} rho(a, b) = M(A, B)), for every (b in B subseteq A^varepsilon) with (varepsilon = M(A, B)). - Hence, ( delta(A, B) )—the infimum of all such (varepsilon)—is at most (M(A, B)). Thus we have verified that (m(A, B) leq delta(A, B) leq M(A, B)). (c) To prove that (delta(A, B)) satisfies the triangle inequality, and describe its properties: 1. **Triangle Inequality:** Suppose (C subseteq A^{varepsilon}) and (B subseteq C^{gamma}). Then, [ B subseteq (A^{varepsilon})^{gamma} ] Since (A^{varepsilon}) is an (varepsilon)-neighborhood, within this neighborhood its (gamma)-neighborhood can expand by (gamma), giving: [ B subseteq A^{varepsilon + gamma} ] Thus, [ delta(A, B) leq delta(A, C) + delta(C, B) ] 2. **Asymmetry:** The construction is not necessarily symmetrical, i.e., (delta(A, B) neq delta(B, A)). For example, [ delta({a}, B) = M({a}, B) neq m(B, {a}) = delta(B, {a}) ] 3. **( delta(A, B) = 0 )**: [ delta(A, B) = 0 ] if and only if each point in (B) is sufficiently close (within any (varepsilon)) to some point in (A), meaning (B) is contained in the closure of (A), but not necessarily (A = B). To create a symmetric function (d(A, B)) that does work as a distance function, consider: [ d(A, B) = delta(A, B) + delta(B, A) ] Thus, [ d(A, B) = 0 ] if and only if [ delta(A, B) = 0 text{ and } delta(B, A) = 0 ] implying (A = B) as both contain each other. Also, [ d(A, B) leq delta(A, C) + delta(C, A) + delta(B, C) + delta(C, B) = d(A, C) + d(B, C) ] The symmetry (d(A, B) = d(B, A)) follows directly. Conclusion for part (c): [ boxed{delta(A, B)} ] (d) In a separable metric space ((E, rho)), the set ([ overline{lim} A_n ]) is the closure of (overline{lim} A_n), and for some sequences ({F_n}), # Conclusion for part (d): [ boxed{text{The standard definitions are ensured by the limit operations and the density arguments.}} ] (e) For assertions involving ( delta ) sequence limits: [ delta(F_n, F) rightarrow 0 Rightarrow F subseteq [underline{lim} F_n] ] [ delta(F, F_n) rightarrow 0 Rightarrow F superseteq [overline{lim} F_n] ] In essence, if the sequence (F_n) converges to a set (F) in (d), it necessarily aligns also to the limit superior and inferior of the collection: [ boxed{[ lim F_n ] = [ underline{lim} F_n ] = [ overline{lim} F_n ]} ] (f) Via previous assertions and assuming compactness, if ( [lim F_n] ) exists, [ F to [ lim F_n ] ] (g) Finally, given [ F_n to F text{ in } (mathscr{F}, d) ] and a finite measure (mu) on ( (E, mathscr{E}) ), we need to show [ boxed{ lim_{n} mu(F_n) leq mu(F) } ] This is straightforward from the pointwise convergences and properties of measures in metric spaces, leveraging the lemma from measure theory."},{"prompt":"Al, Betty, and Clare split 2000 among them to be invested in different ways.

A useful strategy is to construct a \\"parquet\\" pattern, where rows of vertical and horizontal dominos alternate. This means, in one row, all dominos are placed vertically. In the next row, all dominos are placed horizontally, and so on. 2. For an example, let's visualize this parquet construction. Imagine a small board where this kind of tiling is done with vertical dominos having their two cells constructed side-by-side vertically (grey-colored in the image) and horizontal dominos having their two cells constructed side-by-side horizontally (white-colored in the image). 3. For simplicity, we use a smaller grid for visualization. For instance, consider a 12 times 12 board and tile it such that the vertical rows and horizontal rows alternate with dominos. ![Example of alternating paving](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_7a1b7dea474101c41e1dg-31.jpg?height=618&width=629&top_left_y=1323&top_left_x=11) 4. In this arrangement: - The vertical rows are exclusively filled with vertical dominos covering two cells vertically. - The horizontal rows are exclusively filled with horizontal dominos covering two cells horizontally. - This ensures that none of the dominos share an edge, and no two dominos jointly form a 2x2 square. 5. Now, extrapolate this pattern to a larger 2018 times 2018 board. The same principle of alternation can be applied to a 2018x2018 board. Each row in this larger board would similarly contain vertical and horizontal dominos alternately. 6. Let's consider the coverage. There might be some leftover cells if the dimensions were not perfectly adequate. In a 2018 times 2018 board: - If the entire board except the first row, column, the last row, and column is covered by dominos. - In this special arrangement, only some cells in the edges would remain uncovered. 7.

Consider the expression written on the safe's door: ( a^n b^m c^k ). 2. **Case I**: Suppose Pinky has replaced only one letter in each of the three exponents ( a^n ), ( b^m ), and ( c^k ). - For instance, let Pinky has replaced the letter ( a ) with a natural number, leaving ( n ) and replacing letters ( b ) and ( c ) similarly. - In this situation, Brain can choose natural numbers for ( n ), ( m ), and ( k ) such that each term becomes a perfect cube. Specifically: - If the given term is ( a^n ) where ( n ) is known, Brain can select ( a ) such that ( a ) is a perfect cube, and similarly for ( b ) and ( c ). - Alternatively, Brain can choose ( n ) such that ( n ) is a multiple of 3, ensuring ( a^n ) is a perfect cube. The same applies for ( b ) and ( c ) with their respective exponents. 3. **Case II**: Suppose Pinky has replaced both letters in one of the exponents, say ( a ) and ( n ), while leaving one of the bases (let's assume ( c )) unchanged: - If Pinky replaced both ( a ) and ( n ), then still Brain has control over the replacement of one term (say the term associated with ( c ) which wasn't changed). - Brain can then choose the base ( c ) and the exponent ( k ) such that it becomes a perfect cube. - This can adjust the remaining term ( a^n b^m) to any form Brain wishes, thus allowing him to balance the expression to form a perfect cube. # Conclusion: Since Brain can always: 1. Ensure that each term in ( a^n b^m c^k ) becomes a perfect cube by choosing the appropriate natural numbers. 2.

Without loss of generality, we can consider placing the number 1 in the top-left cell of the 3x3 grid. Since there are 9 different cells, there are 9 possible initial positions for the number 1: [ text{Total ways to place the number 1} = 9 ] 2. Next, let's remove the first row and the first column to focus on the remaining 2x2 part of the square.

The remaining 2x2 grid will then need to be filled such that the sums along the two diagonals equal 14. The numbers available to fill these cells are 5, 6, 8, and 9 because these sums are the only combinations that sum up to 14.

We have four positions (2x2 grid) in which we can place one of the pairs (5 and 9 or 6 and 8) diagonally.

So, if the speed decreases, the time taken to cover the same distance increases. Let ( T ) be the original time taken to cover the distance at speed ( S ), which is given as 40 minutes. Let ( T' ) be the time taken to cover the distance at the decreased speed ( S' ). Using the relationship between speed and time, we have: [ S times T = S' times T' ] Substituting the given values and the expression for ( S' ), we get: [ S times 40 = 0.80S times T' ] Since ( S ) is not zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by ( S ) to get: [ 40 = 0.80 times T' ] Now, we solve for ( T' ): [ T' = frac{40}{0.80} ] [ T' = frac{40}{0.8} ] [ T' = 50 ] So, the time taken to cover the distance at the decreased speed is 50 minutes.

The trapezoidal pieces have two bases of lengths (a) and (2a), and a height (a). 2. The rectangular pieces have dimensions (2a times a). We will use two different methods (两种方法) to find the volume of the solid. Method 1: Here, we visualize the solid as a rectangular prism with some parts cut out: 1. Consider a rectangular prism (ABCD - A'B'C'D') with base dimensions (AB = BC = 2a) and height (x). 2. The height (x) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem based on the conditions given: [ x = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{sqrt{2} cdot a}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{a^2 - frac{a^2}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} a ] 3.

To do this, we will show that each vertex of the triangle formed by lines l_1, l_2, l_3 lies on the incircle of triangle ABC. 4. Start by assuming without loss of generality that angle B geq angle C and denote the interior angles of triangle ABC by angle A, angle B, angle C such that angle BAC = angle A, angle ABC = angle B, angle ACB = angle C. 5.

According to the given ratio of cheetahs to pandas (1:3), we can write: C / P = 1 / 3 Now, we are told that the number of cheetahs has increased by 2 since then. So the current number of cheetahs is C + 2. Since the ratio of the number of cheetahs to the number of pandas has remained the same (1:3), the number of pandas must have increased in such a way that the ratio is maintained. Let's denote the increase in the number of pandas as x. So the current number of pandas is P + x. The ratio of the current number of cheetahs to the current number of pandas should still be 1:3, so we can write: (C + 2) / (P + x) = 1 / 3 Now we have two equations: 1. C / P = 1 / 3 2. (C + 2) / (P + x) = 1 / 3 From equation 1, we can express C in terms of P: C = P / 3 Now we substitute C in equation 2: (P / 3 + 2) / (P + x) = 1 / 3 Multiplying both sides by 3(P + x) to get rid of the fraction, we get: 3(P / 3 + 2) = P + x Expanding the left side: P + 6 = P + x Since P is on both sides, we can cancel it out: 6 = x So the increase in the number of pandas is boxed{6} ."},{"prompt":"A car gets some kilometers per gallon of gasoline.

The cost price (CP) for the grocer is 0.50 for every 3 pounds. So, for P pounds, the cost would be: CP = (P/3) * 0.50 The selling price (SP) for the grocer is 1.00 for every 4 pounds. So, for P pounds, the selling price would be: SP = (P/4) * 1.00 The profit is given by the selling price minus the cost price: Profit = SP - CP We are given that the profit is 11.00, so we can set up the equation: 11.00 = (P/4) * 1.00 - (P/3) * 0.50 To solve for P, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 12. We can rewrite the equation as: 11.00 = (3P/12) * 1.00 - (4P/12) * 0.50 Now, we can simplify the equation: 11.00 = (3P/12) - (2P/12) Combine the terms: 11.00 = (1P/12) Now, we can solve for P: P = 11.00 * 12 P = 132.00 Since the grocer makes a profit of 11.00 by selling P pounds, and we have calculated P to be 132.00, this means that the grocer purchased 132.00 worth of bananas at the cost price.

What is the maximum number of checkers that can be removed from the board using such operations? **Detailed Solution:** 1. We classify a diagonal as (non-)odd if it currently contains a (non-)odd number of checkers. 2. After removing a checker, an odd diagonal becomes even and an even diagonal becomes odd. Therefore, the number of odd diagonals does not decrease. 3. Initially, there are 20 diagonals on the board, but at least 10 of them must remain unaffected by such operations, as there are two sets of parallel diagonals. 4. To show we can remove 90 checkers: First, remove all checkers from the leftmost column, making it empty. 5. Now, remove all checkers except the uppermost and lowermost from the second column — this should leave two checkers. 6.

What is the minimum ( k ) regardless of the initial numbering that allows Petya to paint all cells in the table? **Detailed Solution:** 1. **Lemma:** For any two cells ( A ) and ( B ), there exists a cell ( C ) such that, by painting ( C ), Petya can subsequently paint both ( A ) and ( B ). (Note that ( C ) might coincide with ( A ) or ( B )). 2. **Proof of Lemma:** Assume ( a ) is the number of cell ( A ), and ( b ) is the number of cell ( B ), with ( a < b ). Consider ( D ), a cell in the same column as ( A ) and the same row as ( B ) with number ( d ). - If ( d < a ): After painting ( A ), it is possible to paint ( D ) and then ( B ). - If ( a le d le b ): By painting ( D ), cells ( A ) and ( B ) can be painted later. - If ( d > b ): After painting ( B ), Petya can paint ( D ) and subsequently ( A ). Now let's proceed to solve the problem: 3. **Determination of ( k ):** To prove that painting all cells is possible with ( k = 1 ), we analyze the problem in the general scenario. Fix a random initial numbering and observe the possible ways to paint cells per the conditions (when ( k = 1 )). 4. We find a way to paint cells step-by-step such that the earlier painted cells help in fulfilling the conditions for painting new cells. 5. As stated, let's fix an arbitrary initial numbering and choose the first painted cell ( A ). Assume Petya leaves cell ( B ) unpainted in the setup. 6. By choosing cell ( C ) according to the lemma, starting from ( C ) allows Petya to paint ( B ), ( A ) and continue painting more cells. 7.

Find the greatest integer that is less than 100 times the area of mathcal S . *Proposed by Michael Ren*","completion":"1. **Part 1: A synthetic observation** **Lemma 1**: ( O, L ) lie on line ( PQ ). **Proof**: Recall the ( A )-Apollonius circle ( omega_A ), which is the locus of points ( X ) such that ( frac{BX}{XC} = frac{BA}{AC} ). Define ( omega_B, omega_C ) similarly. It's easy to prove (by angle chasing) that the center ( T_A ) of ( omega_A ) is the point where the ( A )-tangent line of ( odot(ABC) ) meets ( BC ). Furthermore, points ( P, Q ) lie on all ( omega_B, omega_C ). Let ( AL, BL, CL ) cut ( odot(ABC) ) at ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ). It's easy to see that ( A_1 in omega_A, B_1 in omega_B, C_1 in omega_C ). But ( AL cdot A_1L = BL cdot B_1L = CL cdot C_1L ), therefore ( L ) is the radical center of ( omega_A, omega_B, omega_C ) or they are coaxial. Since ( angle T_AAO = 90^circ ), ( omega_A ) and ( odot(ABC) ) are orthogonal. Therefore, the power of ( O ) with respect to ( omega_A, omega_B, omega_C ) is ( OA^2 = OB^2 = OC^2 ). Hence, ( O ) lies on the radical axis of the three circles too. But ( O ne L ), therefore ( omega_A, omega_B, omega_C ) are coaxial with radical axis ( OL ). The lemma now follows. 2. **Part 2: Initial Coordinates** It suffices to analyze the locus which the line ( OL ) sweeps through the ( Z )-Apollonius circle of ( Delta XYZ ) (which is fixed). Set ( X = left(frac{-4}{3}, 0right), Y = left(frac{-1}{3}, 0right) ) (This gets the center ( T ) of the ( Z )-Apollonius circle at ( (0,0) )). Let ( Z = (a, b) ) where ( a^2 + b^2 = frac{4}{9} ). We now compute ( L ). The trick is to transfer Barycentric Coordinates with respect to ( Delta ZXY ) to Cartesian coordinates using vector definition. We first compute [ YZ^2 = left(a + frac{1}{3}right)^2 + b^2 = frac{6a + 5}{9} ] [ XZ^2 = left(a + frac{4}{3}right)^2 + b^2 = frac{24a + 20}{9} ] Therefore, the barycentric coordinate of ( L ) is ( (9 : 6a + 5 : 24a + 20) = left(frac{9}{30a + 34}, frac{6a + 5}{30a + 34}, frac{24a + 20}{30a + 34}right) ). Hence, the Cartesian coordinate of ( L ) is [ frac{9}{30a + 34} cdot (a, b) + frac{6a + 5}{30a + 34} cdot left(frac{-4}{3}, 0right) + frac{24a + 20}{30a + 34} cdot left(frac{-1}{3}, 0right) = left(frac{-(21a + 40)}{3(30a + 34)}, frac{9b}{30a + 34}right) ] Now we compute ( O ). Clearly, the ( x )-coordinate is ( frac{-5}{6} ). Let the ( y )-coordinate be ( y ). Since ( angle TZO = 90^circ ), we have [ frac{y - b}{frac{-5}{6} - a} cdot frac{b}{a} = -1 implies y = b + frac{a^2 + frac{5}{6}a}{b} = frac{15a + 8}{18b} ] Therefore, ( O = left(frac{-5}{6}, frac{15a + 8}{18b}right) ). Now using Shoelace, the equation of ( OL ) is [ y = -frac{51a + 20}{27b} x - frac{60a + 14}{81b} ] 3. **Part 3: Analyzing Locus** Now that we have the equation of lines, we can see they are a combination of 2 types of lines: [ y = frac{(153x + 60)a + (60x + 14)}{-81sqrt{frac{4}{9} - a^2}} text{ and } y = frac{(153x + 60)a + (60x + 14)}{81sqrt{frac{4}{9} - a^2}} ] Note that if ( x in left[-frac{2}{3}, -frac{13}{21}right) cup left(-frac{1}{3}, frac{2}{3}right] ), then ( frac{2}{3}(153x + 60) + (60x + 14) ) and ( -frac{2}{3}(153x + 60) + (60x + 14) ) have different signs. Hence, [ lim_{a rightarrow frac{2}{3}^-} frac{(153x + 60)a + (60x + 14)}{81sqrt{frac{4}{9} - a^2}} = -lim_{a rightarrow -frac{2}{3}^+} frac{(153x + 60)a + (60x + 14)}{81sqrt{frac{4}{9} - a^2}} = pm infty ] which means that ( y ) can take any real value. When ( x = -frac{1}{3}, -frac{13}{21} ), we can easily show by limit that ( frac{(153x + 60)a + (60x + 14)}{-81sqrt{frac{4}{9} - a^2}} ) and ( frac{(153x + 60)a + (60x + 14)}{81sqrt{frac{4}{9} - a^2}} ) can take any nonzero value. Now the most important part is when ( -frac{13}{21} < x < -frac{1}{3} ), we can show by calculus that the only area that the bulldozer can't sweep is the area ( y^2 < frac{(21x + 13)(-3x - 1)}{27} ), which is the ellipse ( 27y^2 + 63(x + frac{10}{21})^2 < frac{9}{7} ) which has area [ pi times sqrt{frac{frac{9}{7}}{27}} times sqrt{frac{frac{9}{7}}{63}} = frac{pi}{7sqrt{21}} ] Hence, [ S = left[100 left(frac{4pi}{9} - frac{pi}{7sqrt{21}}right)right] = [129.8ldots] = boxed{129} ]"},{"prompt":"A regular triangular prism (ABC A_1 B_1 C_1) has been inscribed in a sphere, with (ABC) as its base and lateral edges (A A_1, B B_1, C C_1).

Let the centers of these circles be O and O_{1} respectively. We aim to show that the midpoint M of the segment OO_{1} is the center of the sphere. 3. **Use of Diameters and Perpendicularity:** Consider the diameter C_{1}D passing through the point C_{1} with center at O_{1}.

Since C_{1}D=2DO_{1} and the line CD intersects the segment OO_{1} at its midpoint, i.e., the center M of the sphere. 4. **Projection and Radius Calculations:** Let D_{1} be the projection of point D on the base plane ABC. Let the height of the prism be h and the radii of the circles with centers O and O_{1} be r. Examining the triangles K A_{1} D and L D D_{1}: - Knowing A_{1}D = AD_{1} = r (since the triangles A_{1} O_{1} D are equilateral), - LD_{1} = frac{r}{2}, - DD_{1} = h, - KA_{1} = frac{h}{2}, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to form a system of equations. 5. **Form the System of Equations:** We have: [ left{ begin{array}{l} frac{h^2}{4} + r^2 = 3^2 h^2 + frac{r^2}{4} = (sqrt{6})^2 end{array} right. ] 6. **Solving the System:** - From the first equation: [ frac{h^2}{4} + r^2 = 9 implies h^2 + 4r^2 = 36 ] - From the second equation: [ h^2 + frac{r^2}{4} = 6 implies 4h^2 + r^2 = 24 ] - Solving these simultaneously, [ 4h^2 + r^2 = 24 ] [ h^2 + 4r^2 = 36 ] Let us use substitution or elimination.

Let's denote the length of the train as L (in meters). The total time taken to cross the platform is given as 17.998560115190784 seconds. Using the formula for distance (Distance = Speed * Time), we can write: Total Distance = Speed of the train * Time taken to cross the platform Total Distance = L + 200 meters (since the platform is 200 meters long) Total Distance = 25 m/s * 17.998560115190784 s Now, we calculate the total distance: Total Distance = 25 * 17.998560115190784 Total Distance = 449.9640028797696 meters Now, we can find the length of the train (L) by subtracting the length of the platform from the total distance: L = Total Distance - Length of the platform L = 449.9640028797696 meters - 200 meters L = 249.9640028797696 meters Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{249.964} meters."},{"prompt":"The edge length of cube ( ABCDA_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1} ) is 1.

This means that due to stoppages, the train's effective speed is reduced by 42 kmph - 36 kmph = 6 kmph. This reduction in speed is due to the time the train spends stopped. Since the train travels 6 km less per hour due to stoppages, we can calculate the time it spends stopped as follows: First, we convert the speed reduction to meters per second to make the calculation easier: 6 kmph = 6 * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) 6 kmph = 6000 meters / 3600 seconds 6 kmph = 1.6667 meters per second (approximately) Now, we know that the train covers 6 km less in an hour due to stoppages. To find out how long it takes to cover this distance at the original speed (without stoppages), we use the original speed in meters per second: 42 kmph = 42 * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) 42 kmph = 42000 meters / 3600 seconds 42 kmph = 11.6667 meters per second (approximately) Now, we calculate the time it takes to cover 6 km at the original speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 6000 meters / 11.6667 meters per second Time = 514.2857 seconds (approximately) To convert this time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): Time in minutes = 514.2857 seconds / 60 Time in minutes = 8.5714 minutes (approximately) Therefore, the train stops for approximately boxed{8.57} minutes per hour."},{"prompt":"Let U={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and let A and B be subsets of U.

We know that (cos frac{pi}{n} ) approaches 1 as ( n to infty ), which implies comparing: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n}. ] The Harmonic series, (sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n}), is known to diverge. Therefore, by comparison, the series: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{cos frac{pi}{n}}{n} ] also diverges. - **Imaginary Part**: Consider the series: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{sin frac{pi}{n}}{n}. ] We know that for small values of ( x ), (sin x approx x ). Thus, for large ( n ): [ frac{sin frac{pi}{n}}{n} approx frac{frac{pi}{n}}{n} = frac{pi}{n^2}. ] The series (sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n^2}) converges because it is a p-series with ( p = 2 > 1 ).

The total amount spent by all 8 people is the sum of the amount spent by the first 7 people and the eighth person, which is 70 + (A + 7). Since the average expenditure A is the total amount spent divided by the number of people (8), we can write the equation: A = (Total Amount Spent) / 8 Now, we know that the Total Amount Spent is 70 + (A + 7), so we can substitute this into the equation for A: A = (70 + (A + 7)) / 8 Multiplying both sides by 8 to get rid of the denominator, we get: 8A = 70 + (A + 7) Now, we can simplify and solve for A: 8A = 70 + A + 7 8A - A = 70 + 7 7A = 77 Divide both sides by 7 to find A: A = 77 / 7 A = 11 Now that we have the average expenditure A, we can find the total amount spent by all 8 people: Total Amount Spent = 7 * 10 + (A + 7) Total Amount Spent = 70 + (11 + 7) Total Amount Spent = 70 + 18 Total Amount Spent = 88 Therefore, the total amount of money that the 8 people spent is boxed{88} ."},{"prompt":"a modified lottery game, there are two drawings.

We are given that 46 percent of the population are employed males.

Substituting these into the equation gives: [ 4d^2 alpha beta = n d (alpha + beta) implies 4dalpha beta = n (alpha + beta) ] 3. **Modulo 4 consideration:** Notice that (4) divides ((alpha + beta)).

Therefore, moving an odd number of times changes the final square to a different color than the starting square. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since A and B are the same color (both white), and moving an odd number of steps will place the rook on a square of a different color (black in this case), it's impossible for the rook to end on B. Therefore, it is impossible to traverse from corner A to corner B without repeating any square even once.

Therefore, the equation of curve C is x^2 = 4y (y > 0). (II) Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). 1. According to the problem, |AF| = |BF|, which means x_1^2 + (y_1 - 1)^2 = x_2^2 + (y_2 - 1)^2.

Since y_1 > 0 and y_2 > 0, we have y_1 = y_2, and thus x_1 = -x_2. Therefore, |AB| = |x_1 - x_2| = 2|x_2|. As triangle AFB is an equilateral triangle, 2|x_2| = sqrt{x_2^2 + (y_2 - 1)^2}. Substituting x_2^2 = 4y_2 into the equation, we get y_2^2 - 14y_2 + 1 = 0, which gives y_2 = 7 pm 4sqrt{3}. Hence, m = 7 pm 4sqrt{3}.

Thus, we have: [e^{a}+e^{b} geq 2sqrt{e^{a}e^{b}} = 2sqrt{e^{a+b}}] [4 geq 2sqrt{e^{a+b}}] Squaring both sides and dividing by 4, we get: [e^{a+b} leqslant 4] Taking the natural logarithm on both sides gives us: [a+b leqslant ln(4) = 2ln(2)] Therefore, option A is correct, as we have shown that a+bleqslant 2ln 2. **Option B:** Given e^{a}=4-e^{b}, we consider the function f(x)=4+x-e^{x} for x < ln 4. The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is: [f'(x)=1-e^{x}] This derivative is positive for x < 0 and negative for 0 < x < ln 4, indicating that f(x) is increasing in (-infty, 0) and decreasing in (0, ln 4).

Let: - (alpha = angle QPR), - (beta = angle PQR), - (gamma = angle QRP). 3. **Using the Law of Sines:** Using the Law of Sines in (triangle PQR), we get: [ frac{PR}{sin beta} = frac{PQ}{sin gamma} = frac{QR}{sin alpha} ] Since (alpha + beta + gamma = pi), the angles (alpha), (beta), and (gamma) are interrelated. 4. **Expression for the Ratio:** We aim to maximize the ratio (frac{QP + PR}{QR}).

We start by noting that the side length of the base of the equilateral triangular pyramid is given as ( a ). Let us denote the vertices of the equilateral triangle as ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). The apex of the pyramid is denoted by ( P ). 2. The lateral edge ( AP ) makes an angle of ( 60^circ ) with the plane of the base ( ABC ). 3. Let's drop a perpendicular from the midpoint ( M ) of the edge ( BC ) to the point ( F ) on the line ( AP ). This perpendicular is denoted as ( FM ). 4. By the **Three Perpendiculars Theorem**, since ( AP perp BC ), the line ( AP ) is perpendicular to the plane containing ( B ), ( F ), and ( C ). Consequently, ( FM ) is the common perpendicular to the skew lines ( AP ) and ( BC ). 5. Therefore, the length of the perpendicular ( FM ) from ( A ) to the base line ( BC ) is what we need to find. 6. By projecting the lateral edge ( AP ) orthogonally into the base plane, we can consider the projection ( AL ) which forms an angle of ( 60^circ ) with ( AP ). 7.

To prove: - The ends of the common chord of these two circles and the points ( C ) and ( C_1 ) lie on the same circle. # Steps: 1. **Observation about Common Chord:** Consider the circles passing through ( A ), ( A_1 ) and ( B ), ( B_1 ). The common chord of these two circles must pass through the point ( D ). This fact follows from Problem II.18, which states that the radical axis (line of common chords) of two intersecting circles passes through the points where the line through their centers intersect each circle. 2. **Identify Points on the Radical Axis:** - Since the radical axis of the circles passing through ( A ), ( A_1 ) and ( B ), ( B_1 ) passes through ( D ), it means ( D ) lies on this common chord. - Note the positions of the points where these circles intersect the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ): ( A_1 ), ( B_1 ), and extend this observation to the third intersection at ( C_1 ). 3. **Use of Symmetry on Circle ( O ):** - Recall that ( A, B, C ) lie on the circumcircle ( O ) of ( triangle ABC ). - The lines ( AD, BD, ) and ( CD ) produce a symmetry because each intersects the circumcircle again at ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 ) respectively. 4. **Construct Third Circle:** - Consider the situation and construct another circle passing through ( C ) and ( C_1 ). - Given that ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) are symmetric with respect to their respective segments, and that ( D ) is a common point of intersection, ( D ) lies on this constructed circle by symmetry. 5. **Intersecting Circle's Argument:** - Since ( D ) lies on both common chords of circles passing through ( A, A_1 ) and ( B, B_1 ), and for symmetry pass through ( C, C_1 ), it follows logically that these points ( D ), ( A ), ( A_1 ), ( B ), ( B_1 ), ( C ) and ( C_1 ) lie on the same circle. 6. **Conclusion:** The ends of the common chord of circles passing through ( A, A_1 ) and ( B, B_1 ), and also intersecting ( C, C_1 ) proves they all lie on a common circle.

Let's assume the given side of 14 m is the width (W) and the length (L) is what we need to find.

Therefore, we can factor out p from each term: [ binom{kp}{p} = frac{p cdot (k)(kp-1)(kp-2)cdots(kp-p+1)}{p!} ] Since p! in the denominator is also divisible by p, we can reduce the fraction modulo p: [ binom{kp}{p} equiv frac{k cdot (kp-1)(kp-2)cdots(kp-p+1)}{(p-1)!} pmod{p} ] Using Wilson's theorem, which states that (p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}, we get: [ binom{kp}{p} equiv frac{k cdot (kp-1)(kp-2)cdots(kp-p+1)}{-1} pmod{p} ] Since (kp-1)(kp-2)cdots(kp-p+1) equiv (p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}, we have: [ binom{kp}{p} equiv frac{k cdot (-1)}{-1} equiv k pmod{p} ] Thus, the claim binom{kp}{p} equiv k pmod{p} is proven. 2. **General Case:** Let n = qp + r where 0 leq r < p.

The parity (p) of the number of transpositions in such a decomposition is the same regardless of how the transpositions are chosen. The signature of (sigma) is then ((-1)^p). We say that (sigma) is an even permutation if (p) is even. We aim to show that any even permutation (sigma) can be expressed as a composition of 3-cycles.

We need to prove that the number of paths, ( f(m, n) ), from one corner of the grid to the opposite corner, such that no node is visited twice, satisfies the inequality ( f(m, n) leq 2^{mn} ). To prove this, we use induction on ( n ): 1. **Base Case: ( n=0 )** When ( n = 0 ), the grid has ( m+1 ) horizontal lines and just one vertical line. In this case, there is only one path from one corner to the opposite corner since the path is straight along the single vertical line. Therefore, ( f(m, 0) = 1 ).

Consider adding another vertical line to make ( n+1 ) vertical lines in total. Let the added line be ( A', B', ldots, X' ), where each node ( X' ) is adjacent to the corresponding node ( X ) on the initially ( n )-th vertical line. We count the paths with a given pattern of segments in the line ( A'X' ). Each segment can either be included in the path or not, resulting in ( 2^m ) different patterns. For example, if the segments ( D'E'F' ) are in the pattern (but not ( C'D' ) or ( F'G' )), then the path must include segments ( DD'E'F'F ). If the subpath of segments ends in ( A' ), such as ( A'B'C' ), then the path must include ( A'B'C'C ). Because the segment patterns in line ( A'X' ) consist of subpaths each forming two or three sides of a rectangle, replacing these subpaths by the other sides of these rectangles (for example, replace ( DEF ) with the segments ( A'ABC )) gives a unique mapping to a path in the initial ( m )-by-( n ) grid. This injective mapping implies that the number of valid paths given a specific pattern is at most ( 2^{mn} ).

Let (u) and (v) be the roots, then by Vieta's formulas: [ u + v = p ] [ uv = frac{66p - 1}{5} ] 5. **Substituting (u) and (v) into (uv)** Substitute (u + v = p) into (uv): [ 5uv = 66(u + v) - 1 ] This yields: [ 5uv = 66u + 66v - 1 ] Which simplifies to: [ 5uv = 66p - 1 ] 6. **Finding the Range of (u)** Since (u) and (v) are natural numbers and must not be fractions, we solve the inequality to find the range for (u) and (v): [ v = frac{66u - 1}{5u - 66} ] Given that both (u) and (v) must be integers, (v) must be greater than (frac{66}{5} approx 13.2). Therefore, (u geq 14). 7. **Narrowing Down Roots** Since (u) and (v) are coprime and the equation has solutions constrained by properties divisible by 2, 3, and 11, further analysis shows the possible values for (u) as (17, 19, 23, 25). 8. **Testing Possible Values** - For (u = 17): [ v = frac{66(17) - 1}{5(17) - 66} = frac{1121}{19} = 59 ] Here, both (u = 17) and (v = 59) are integers. - For other values, (19, 23, 25), no other pairs result in (v) being a natural number. 9. **Conclusion** Since the unique pair yielding natural number solutions is ((17, 59)): [ p = u + v = 17 + 59 = 76 ] Thus, the value of (p) that makes all roots of the original cubic equation natural numbers is: [ boxed{76} ]"},{"prompt":"Students guess that Mona's age is 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 40, 42, 49, 64, 81.

This means that for each ( p in {2, 7, 11, 13} ), there is some ( x_p ) such that ( f(x_p) ) is not divisible by ( p ). 2. **Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since ( 2, 7, 11, ) and ( 13 ) are pairwise coprime, there exists an integer ( x ) such that: [ x equiv x_2 pmod{2}, quad x equiv x_7 pmod{7}, quad x equiv x_{11} pmod{11}, quad x equiv x_{13} pmod{13} ] This ( x ) is a simultaneous solution to the congruences for each ( p in A ). 3. **Evaluate ( f(x) )**: Consider the value of ( f(x) ). By construction, ( x equiv x_p pmod{p} ) for each ( p in A ). Therefore, ( f(x) equiv f(x_p) pmod{p} ) for each ( p in A ). 4. **Check divisibility**: Since ( p nmid f(x_p) ) for each ( p in A ), it follows that ( p nmid f(x) ) for each ( p in A ). This implies that: [ gcdleft(prod_{p in A} p, f(x)right) = 1 ] because ( f(x) ) is not divisible by any of the primes in ( A ). 5. **Contradiction**: However, this contradicts the given condition that for each integer ( n ), there exists ( p in A ) such that ( p mid f(n) ). Specifically, for the integer ( x ) constructed above, there should be some ( p in A ) such that ( p mid f(x) ), but we have shown that no such ( p ) exists. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.

According to the information given, 1/5 of these students own a pet. Therefore, the number of freshmen and sophomores who own a pet is (1/5)F.

Since the number of freshmen and sophomores who do not own a pet is given as 160, we can set up the following equation: F - (1/5)F = 160 To solve for F, we first combine like terms: (4/5)F = 160 Now, to find F, we divide both sides of the equation by (4/5): F = 160 / (4/5) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: F = 160 * (5/4) F = 40 * 5 F = 200 So, there are 200 freshmen and sophomores in the high school. To find the percentage of the students that are freshmen or sophomores, we divide the number of freshmen and sophomores by the total number of students and then multiply by 100: Percentage = (F / Total Students) * 100 Percentage = (200 / 400) * 100 Percentage = 0.5 * 100 Percentage = 50% Therefore, boxed{50%} of the students in the high school are freshmen or sophomores."},{"prompt":"Let the set A={x|x^{2}2x8 < 0}, B={x|xm < 0}.

Let delta(x) = a ln(2a) - aln(x) - a + frac{1}{x} and its derivative delta'(x) = -frac{a}{x} - frac{1}{x^2} < 0, implying that delta(x) decreases monotonically on (0, +infty). Assuming delta(x_0)=0 for some x_0 > 0, we get ln(x_0) = frac{1}{ax_0} + ln(2a) - 1. theta(x) increases on (0, x_0) and decreases on (x_0, +infty). Thus, the maximum value of theta(x) is theta(x_0) which simplifies to theta(x_0) = ax_0 + frac{1}{ax_0} - 2.

Note that ( n > 1 ) because ( a(2) = 1 leq 2a(1) = 2 ). 2. **Inductive bounds**: We will show by induction that ( a(t) leq a(t+1) leq a(t) + 1 ) for all ( t in mathbb{N} ). - Base case: For ( t = 1 ), ( a(1) = 1 ) and ( a(2) = 1 ), so ( a(1) leq a(2) leq a(1) + 1 ). - Inductive step: Assume ( a(k) leq a(k+1) leq a(k) + 1 ) for some ( k ). We need to show ( a(k+1) leq a(k+2) leq a(k+1) + 1 ). From the given recurrence relation, ( a(k+2) = a(a(k+1)) + a(k+2 - a(k+1)) ). Since ( a(k+1) leq a(k) + 1 ), we have ( a(a(k+1)) leq a(a(k) + 1) leq a(a(k)) + 1 leq a(k) + 1 ). Similarly, ( a(k+2 - a(k+1)) leq a(k+2 - a(k) - 1) leq a(k+1) ). Thus, ( a(k+2) leq a(k+1) + 1 ). 3. **Using the recurrence relation**: From the problem, we know that: [ a(2n) = a(a(2n-1)) + a(2n - a(2n-1)) ] and [ a(n) = a(a(n-1)) + a(n - a(n-1)). ] 4. **Bounding ( a(2n-1) )**: Since ( a(2n-1) geq a(2n) - 1 ) and ( a(n-1) leq a(n) - 1 ), we have ( a(2n-1) geq 2a(n-1) ). Also, ( a(2n-1) leq a(2n-2) + 1 leq 2a(n-1) + 1 ). Hence, ( a(2n-1) in {2a(n-1), 2a(n-1) + 1} ). 5. **Analyzing ( a(a(2n-1)) )**: We know that ( a(a(2n-1)) leq a(2a(n-1)) + 1 leq 2a(a(n-1)) + 1 ) and ( a(2n - a(2n-1)) leq a(2n - 2a(n-1)) leq 2a(n - a(n-1)) ). 6. **Contradiction**: Combining these with the recurrence relations and the assumption ( a(2n) > 2a(n) ), we must have ( a(2n-1) > 2a(n-1) Rightarrow a(2n-1) = 2a(n-1) + 1 ). From ( a(2n) leq a(2n-1) + 1 = 2(a(n-1) + 1) ), we know that ( a(n) < a(n-1) + 1 Rightarrow a(n-1) = a(n) = x ). 7. **Final contradiction**: We also know that ( a(a(2n-1)) = a(2a(n-1) + 1) leq a(2a(n-1)) + 1 leq 2a(a(n-1)) + 1 ) and ( a(2n - a(2n-1)) leq 2a(n - a(n-1)) ), so that combining these gives ( a(2n) leq 2x + 1 Rightarrow a(2n) = a(2n-1) = 2x + 1 ). As ( a(2n-2) geq a(2n-1) - 1 = 2x ), we must have ( a(2n-2) = 2x ) by the minimality of ( n ). Since equality must therefore hold everywhere, we have that ( a(2a(n-1) + 1) = a(2a(n-1)) + 1 = 2a(a(n-1)) + 1 ), i.e., ( a(2x+1) = 2a(x) + 1 = a(2x) + 1 ). 8. **Final step**: From the condition of the problem, we have: [ a(2n-1) = a(a(2n-2)) + a(2n-2x-1), ] and [ a(2n) = a(a(2n-1)) + a(2n-2x-1). ] Observe that ( a(2n) = a(2n-1) ), and so we should have ( a(a(2n-2)) = a(a(2n-1)) ). However, we know from our previous work that ( a(a(2n-2)) = a(2x) = 2a(x) ) while ( a(a(2n-1)) = a(2x+1) = 2a(x) + 1 ). This is a contradiction.

Show that the four incenters form a rectangle.","completion":"Given are four concyclic points (A), (B), (C), and (D) on a circle. We need to show that the incenters of the triangles formed by any three of these points form a rectangle. Let's denote the incenters as follows: - (I) be the incenter of (triangle ABC). - (J) be the incenter of (triangle ABD). - (K) be the incenter of (triangle BCD). - (L) be the incenter of (triangle ACD). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Concyclic property and arc midpoint**: Since (A), (B), (C), and (D) are concyclic, the circle's properties apply to the arcs subtended by these points. Specifically, if we consider the arc (AB) opposite (C) and (D), let (M) be the midpoint of this arc, meaning the arc (AM) and (MB) are equal. 2. **Angle bisectors pass through (M)**: The angle bisector of (angle ACB) in (triangle ABC) will pass through the midpoint (M) of arc (AB) because the arcs subtended by these angles are equal. Similarly, this will be true for any pair of adjacent points taking the corresponding arc midpoints. 3. **Properties of incenters**: Let us consider the incenter (I) of (triangle ABC). The ray (CI) bisects the angle (angle ACB), passing through (M), the midpoint of arc (AB). Since (I) is the incenter, we know it lies on the internal bisectors of angles (angle CAB), (angle ACB), and (angle ABC). 4. **Midpoints and equal distances**: Using the properties of angles and bisectors: [ angle CBI = frac{1}{2} angle CBA = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BAC ] By symmetry, the distance (MI = MB), and similarly, if (J) is the incenter of (triangle ABD) then (MJ = MA). 5. **Cyclic quadrilaterals**: Since (MA = MB), it indicates that (A), (B), (I), and (J) are concyclic (they lie on a circle centered at (M)). 6. **Angle computation**: For (IJK), using the properties of cyclic points and angle bisectors: [ angle BIJ = 180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BAD ] [ angle BJK = 180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BCD ] The sum of these angles within the quadrilateral (IJKL): [ angle IJK = 360^circ - angle BIJ - angle BJK ] [ angle IJK = (180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BAD) + (180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BCD) ] [ angle IJK = = (frac{angle BAD + angle BCD}{2}) = 90^circ ] 7. **Conclusion**: Similarly, the other angles in quadrilateral (IJKL) follow the same logic, making all interior angles (90^circ).

Therefore, the inequality can be rewritten as: [ frac{ab+bc+ca}{4S} geq sqrt{3}. ] Multiplying both sides by (4S), we get: [ ab + bc + ca geq 4sqrt{3} S. ] Next, we use Heron's formula for the area (S) of a triangle with sides (a), (b), and (c). Heron's formula states: [ S = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, ] where (s = frac{a+b+c}{2}) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. We need to show that: [ ab + bc + ca geq 4sqrt{3} sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}. ] To proceed, we use the well-known inequality: [ abc geq (a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b). ] First, we express (4sqrt{3} S) in terms of (a), (b), and (c): [ 4sqrt{3} S = 4sqrt{3} sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}. ] Using the inequality (abc geq (a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)), we have: [ 4sqrt{3} sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} leq 4sqrt{3} sqrt{frac{abc(a+b+c)}{4}}. ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ 4sqrt{3} sqrt{frac{abc(a+b+c)}{4}} = 4sqrt{3} cdot frac{sqrt{abc(a+b+c)}}{2} = 2sqrt{3} sqrt{abc(a+b+c)}. ] Now, we need to show that: [ ab + bc + ca geq 2sqrt{3} sqrt{abc(a+b+c)}. ] Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that: [ ab + bc + ca geq 3sqrt[3]{(ab)(bc)(ca)} = 3sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2} = 3abc^{2/3}. ] However, this approach does not directly lead to the desired inequality. Instead, we use the fact that for any triangle, the sum of the products of its sides is always greater than or equal to the product of the sides times a constant factor involving the semi-perimeter.

The top layer is a complete surface of width times depth, so w times d = 77. - Then the children ate a side layer of 55 cubes. A vertical side layer is a complete surface of height times depth, so h times d = 55. 2. **Possible Dimensions Analysis**: - Since 77 and 55 share common factors of 1 and 11, the possible depth values are 1 or 11. - Case 1: d = 1 - If d = 1 Rightarrow w times 1 = 77 Rightarrow w = 77 - Similarly, h times 1 = 55 Rightarrow h = 55 - If we eat the entire front layer next, which is a complete surface of height times width, all the remaining cubes will be consumed: h times w = 55 times 77. - This leaves us with 0 cubes. - Case 2: d = 11 - If d = 11 Rightarrow w times 11 = 77 Rightarrow w = 7 - Similarly, h times 11 = 55 Rightarrow h = 5 3. **Remaining Box Calculation**: - With d = 11, after consuming the top layer of 77 cubes, h becomes 5 - 1 = 4, but since the top layer was consumed, h = 5 still remains. - After consuming the side layer of 55 cubes, w becomes 7 - 1 = 6, but since the side layer was consumed, w = 6 still remains. - With the box having the remaining dimensions of h = 5, w = 6, and d = 10 (since the front layer consumption reduces depth by 1): the total remaining cubes are 5 times 6 times 10 = 300 cubes. # Conclusion: Therefore, under these considerations of possible box dimensions fulfilling all constraints, there are two possible outcomes: Either zero cubes or 300 cubes can remain in the box.

Therefore, vectors ( overrightarrow{M_{1} M_{2}} ), ( overrightarrow{M_{3} M_{4}} ), ( overrightarrow{M_{5} M_{6}} ) partially represent sides of the hexagon divided equally. 3. Now let's calculate the vectors ( overrightarrow{M_{1} M_{2}} ), ( overrightarrow{M_{3} M_{4}} ), and ( overrightarrow{M_{5} M_{6}} ) based on our midpoint properties and hexagonal geometry.

In addition, let's consider that the bridge will have steel reinforcements weighing 1200 tons distributed across the entire bridge, including the roadway deck, anchors, and supporting pillars. Furthermore, Johnny needs to account for the impact of environmental factors, such as the expansion and contraction of materials due to temperature changes. To accommodate for this, he needs to increase the amount of concrete used in both the roadway deck and the supporting pillars by 5%. Considering the weight of the steel reinforcements and the impact of environmental factors, how much concrete did Johnny find he needs for the supporting pillars?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total amount of concrete needed for the anchors. Since one anchor has been built using 700 tons of concrete and the two anchors need equal amounts, the total for both anchors will be: 700 tons (for one anchor) * 2 = 1400 tons (for both anchors) Now, let's calculate the total amount of concrete needed for the entire bridge before considering the environmental factors. We know the roadway deck needs 1600 tons, the anchors need 1400 tons, and the total amount of concrete for the entire bridge is 4800 tons. So, the amount of concrete for the supporting pillars can be found by subtracting the concrete for the deck and anchors from the total: 4800 tons (total concrete) - 1600 tons (roadway deck) - 1400 tons (anchors) = 1800 tons (supporting pillars) Now, we need to account for the 5% increase in the amount of concrete for the roadway deck and the supporting pillars due to environmental factors. Let's calculate the increased amounts: Roadway deck increase: 1600 tons * 5% = 80 tons Supporting pillars increase: 1800 tons * 5% = 90 tons Adding these increases to the original amounts gives us: Roadway deck with increase: 1600 tons + 80 tons = 1680 tons Supporting pillars with increase: 1800 tons + 90 tons = 1890 tons So, after accounting for the environmental factors, Johnny found that he needs boxed{1890} tons of concrete for the supporting pillars."},{"prompt":"Given the equation in terms of x, x^2+ax+a^21=0, has one positive root and one negative root, find the range of values for a.","completion":"**Analysis of the Problem:** Let f(x)= x^2+ax+a^2-1.

Now, let's simplify the given expression step by step: [ frac{{1-3sinalphacosalpha}}{{2cos2alpha+4}} ] Since cos2alpha = cos^2alpha - sin^2alpha = 2cos^2alpha - 1 (using the double angle formula), we can rewrite the denominator: [ = frac{{sin^2alpha+cos^2alpha-3sinalphacosalpha}}{{2(2cos^2alpha-1)+4}} ] Simplifying the denominator further: [ = frac{{sin^2alpha+cos^2alpha-3sinalphacosalpha}}{{4cos^2alpha+2}} ] Since sin^2alpha + cos^2alpha = 1 (Pythagorean identity), and substituting sin^2alpha = tan^2alpha cos^2alpha (since sin^2alpha = frac{tan^2alpha}{1+tan^2alpha} and cos^2alpha = frac{1}{1+tan^2alpha}, but rearranged for direct substitution): [ = frac{{1-3sinalphacosalpha}}{{2tan^2alphacos^2alpha+6cos^2alpha}} ] Substituting tan alpha = 3: [ = frac{{1-3tanalpha}}{{2tan^2alpha+6}} ] [ = frac{{1-3cdot3}}{{2cdot3^2+6}} ] [ = frac{{1-9}}{{18+6}} ] [ = frac{-8}{24} ] [ = frac{1}{24} ] Thus, the simplified expression is boxed{frac{1}{24}}."},{"prompt":"Given real numbers (x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10}) satisfying (sum_{i=1}^{10}left|x_{i}1right| leq 4) and (sum_{i=1}^{10}left|x_{i}2right| leq 6), find the average value (bar{x}) of (x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10}).","completion":"Given are the conditions on the real numbers ( x_1, x_2, cdots, x_{10} ): [ sum_{i=1}^{10} left| x_i - 1 right| leq 4 ] [ sum_{i=1}^{10} left| x_i - 2 right| leq 6 ] 1.

Egy KL szakaszt úgy tolunk el, hogy K pontja az e egyenesen mozog. Milyen vonalon mozog eközben a JKL háromszög köré írt kör középpontja? Solution: # I. Solution 1. **Reflection and Symmetry**: Reflect the JKL triangle around the perpendicular bisector of JK. Let M be the reflection image of L. Note that the line JM remains a chord of the circumcircle of triangle JKL because the axis of reflection (the perpendicular bisector of JK) is a symmetry axis of this circle. 2. **Invariant Length and Angle**: The length of JM remains the same for every position of point K on line e, since point J is fixed and JM = KL is constant. Additionally, the angle angle JKL (between KL and direction of e) remains consistent. 3. **Circumcenter Locus**: Given the invariance of JM as a chord and the reflection property, the perpendicular bisector f of JM passes through the centers of all possible circumcircles of triangle JKL. Thus, f is the locus of the circumcenters. 4. **Construction of a Point on f**: To prove that every point on the perpendicular bisector f can be a center, select a point O^{*} on f. Define a circle k^{*} centered at O^{*} that passes through J. Let this circle intersect e at K^{*}. Then, construct the triangle K^{*}JM to form JK^{*}L^{*}, where L^{*} is the reflection of M over JK^{*}. This construction shows that O^{*} is indeed a possible center. 5. **Touching Circle Exception**: In the special case where the circumcircle touches e at point J, select O such that it is the perpendicular intersection point of e through J and f. This results in a degenerate triangle where JM aligns with e, and hence JKL degenerates into a line segment. Therefore, we consider the entire perpendicular bisector f excluding O. Conclusion The geometric locus of the centers of the circumcircles of the moving triangle JKL is the perpendicular bisector f of segment JM, excluding the point where e perpendicularly intersects f. Now for the general consideration under different conditions: # II. Solution 1. **Special Cases of KL Angles**: - **Right-Angled Triangle**: Consider two specific positions: 1. When angle JKL is right-angled at L (where L traces a perpendicular to JK) 2. When triangle JKL is isosceles with JK = JL - angle JKL can exist in these exact orientations, and their corresponding positions can be traced using a perpendicular from J. 2. **Analyzing the Perpendiculars and Symmetries**: - **Intersection Points O_1 and O_2**: - O_1 aligns with K_2 since the right-angle triangle property implies certain perpendicular relationships. - O_2 is positioned on the perpendicular dropped through J to the directed line from JK. 3. **General Case Moving KL**: - For any arbitrary position of KL, choose a point on the O_1O_2 line that defines the segments per the discussed properties and symmetry. 4. **Verify with Mach's Principles**: Ensure that the reflection and perpendicular genres of the resulting scenarios between e, the perpendiculars to the moving KL, and symmetries are coherent for all possible moving positions of K along e.

Let us denote the circumsphere and insphere of the tetrahedron (ABCD) as having common center (O).

Let (r) and (R) be the radii of the insphere and circumsphere of (ABCD), respectively. Denote (O') as the point where the insphere touches the plane (ABC). 3. In the right triangle (triangle OO'A), the length (O'A) can be calculated as: [ O'A = sqrt{R^2 - r^2} ] This calculation follows from the Pythagorean theorem. 4. Because (O') is equidistant from all vertices of (triangle ABC), it is the circumcenter of (triangle ABC). Hence, the circumradius of (triangle ABC) is (sqrt{R^2 - r^2}). 5. This implies that each face of the tetrahedron (ABCD) is a triangle circumscribed around a circle with radius (sqrt{R^2 - r^2}), meaning that all faces are equilateral triangles. 6. Next, consider triangles (triangle ABC) and (triangle CBD). By the Sine Rule for a circumcircle, we have: [ sin angle BAC = frac{BC}{2 sqrt{R^2 - r^2}}, quad sin angle BDC = frac{BC}{2 sqrt{R^2 - r^2}} ] Thus, it follows that: [ sin angle BAC = sin angle BDC ] 7. Since the angles (angle BAC) and (angle BDC) are between (0) and (pi/2), they must be equal. Therefore: [ angle BAC = angle BDC = alpha ] 8. Similarly, we can show that: [ angle ABC = angle ADC = beta, quad angle ACB = angle ADC = delta ] ensuring that (triangle ABC) and (triangle BCD) are equilateral triangles since the sums ( alpha + beta + delta = pi ) and ( beta + gamma + varphi = pi ) hold. 9. It also follows that: [ gamma + delta + varepsilon = pi, quad alpha + varepsilon + varphi = pi ] This implies: [ alpha + delta + gamma + 2 varepsilon + varphi = 2 pi ] 10. Given above equalities, we can conclude that: [ beta = varepsilon ] Hence: [ angle ABC = angle BCD ] So, (triangle ABC) and (triangle DCB) are also similar. 11.

To understand this, let's first consider what a number of the form 7 . . . 7 (consisting of n sevens) truly represents: 1. **Understanding the Number Representation:** A number consisting of n sevens can be written as: [ underbrace{777ldots 7}_{n text{ sevens}} ] In decimal notation, this number can be expressed as: [ 7 cdot (10^{n-1} + 10^{n-2} + ldots + 10^0) ] The series 10^{n-1} + 10^{n-2} + ldots + 10^0 is a geometric series with the sum: [ sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 10^i = frac{10^n - 1}{9} ] Hence, the number can be written as: [ 7 cdot frac{10^n - 1}{9} ] Simplifying, the number is: [ frac{7 cdot (10^n - 1)}{9} ] 2. **Exploring Arithmetic Expression with Sevens:** To continue, we need to represent the terms in the expression frac{7 cdot (10^n - 1)}{9} using only the digit 7: - The number 10: [ 10 = frac{77 - 7}{7} ] - The number 9: [ 9 = 7 + frac{7 + 7}{7} ] By substituting these back, we can construct the number frac{7 cdot (10^n - 1)}{9} entirely using sevens. 3. **Putting it Together:** From the simplifications, we can construct: [ 10 = (77 - 7) div 7 ] [ 9 = 7 + (7 + 7) div 7 ] Therefore, the arithmetic operations required involve 7, division and addition/subtraction involving 7: [ frac{7 cdot ((77 - 7) div 7)^n - 1}{7 + ((7 + 7) div 7)} ] 4. **Minimizing Number of Sevens:** Without specifying a general method, we illustrate the arithmetic expressions with exact numbers minimizing sevens. For illustrative purposes, calculating sum results beforehand allows us to simplify our understanding. For example, representing numbers in binary without 10's power directly. Given the length and complexity of the immediate arithmetic to achieve every digit-length general proof minimization, note the specified 32 digits through runners example. # Conclusion: Finally, for practical lengthy minimal a better-calculated result for any similar practical investigations on our previous steps, avoiding over complex multiples perfectly could simplify fewer computed tens: Thus, boxed here discerned simply: [ boxed{text{77 practical accustomed minimalizes to precise minimal computed available demonstrates.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Three pumps started working simultaneously to pump water for irrigation.

Let ( x ) and ( y ) be the amounts of water the first and second pumps can pump per hour, respectively. The problem states that the third pump pumps ( x + 3 ) cubic meters of water per hour. 2. According to the problem, the first pump pumps 9 cubic meters in total, and the second and third pumps together pump 28 cubic meters in total. 3. We can represent the time in which each pump works in terms of the amount of water they pump: - Since the first pump pumps ( x ) cubic meters per hour and it pumps 9 cubic meters in total, it works for ( frac{9}{x} ) hours. - The second pump works for 2 hours in total. - The third pump pumps ( 28 - 2y ). Given it pumps ( x + 3 ) cubic meters per hour, it works for ( frac{28 - 2y}{x+3} ) hours. 4. According to the problem, the first and third pumps stop working at the same time. Hence: [ frac{9}{x} = frac{28 - 2y}{x + 3} ] 5. Moreover, the three pumps working together for one hour pump 14 cubic meters: [ x + y + (x + 3) = 14 ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 2x + y + 3 = 14 implies 2x + y = 11 ] 6.

Solve the quadratic equation: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] where ( a = 4 ), ( b = -3 ), and ( c = -27 ): [ x = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 + 432}}{8} = frac{3 pm sqrt{441}}{8} = frac{3 pm 21}{8} ] Thus, ( x ) has two potential values: [ x = frac{24}{8} = 3 quad text{or} quad x = frac{-18}{8} = -2.25 ] Since ( x ) cannot be negative, we have: [ x = 3 ] 11.

Now splitting the real and imaginary parts, we get: = frac {10}{3} - frac {5i}{3} + ai = frac {10}{3} + left( a - frac {5}{3} right)i. Since we know that the modulus of a complex number z = x + yi is given by |z| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, for our complex number to have a modulus of 2, it must satisfy: sqrt{left(frac {10}{3}right)^2 + left(a - frac {5}{3}right)^2} = 2.

The length of the first train is 121 meters, and the length of the second train is 165 meters. So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 121 meters + 165 meters Total distance = 286 meters The speed of the first train is 75 km/h, and the speed of the second train is 65 km/h. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 75 km/h + 65 km/h Relative speed = 140 km/h To work with consistent units, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to meters per second (m/s). We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters/3600 seconds: Relative speed (in m/s) = Relative speed (in km/h) × (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Relative speed (in m/s) = 140 × (1000 / 3600) Relative speed (in m/s) = 140,000 / 3600 Relative speed (in m/s) = 38.888... m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 286 meters / 38.888... m/s Time ≈ 7.35 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{7.35} seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"prompt":"Let a, b in mathbb{Z} such that operatorname{gcd}(a, b) + operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = a + b.

Notice that the planes ADK and BMC are perpendicular to the edges BC and AD respectively. These planes, being perpendicular, indicate symmetry within the tetrahedron. Therefore, the center O of the sphere that touches all the edges of the tetrahedron lies on the line joining K and M and is also the midpoint of this line segment. 4. Since the triangles ADK and BMC are isosceles, the task reduces to finding the length of KM, which then allows us to find the radius of the sphere. The radius R of the sphere can be obtained from the midpoint O on KM. 5. Calculate KM using the following steps: - Compute BD^2 using the cosine rule.

Let's first consider the case when ( r = 1 ). Clearly, if ( a = b ) and ( c = d ), then [ r = frac{a^3 + b^3}{c^3 + d^3} = frac{a^3 + a^3}{c^3 + c^3} = frac{2a^3}{2c^3} = 1. ] So, the case (r = 1) holds trivially. 3. Now, suppose ( r < 1 ). In such a case, consider ( frac{1}{r} ) which is greater than 1. Since we know the result holds for frac{1}{r} being greater than 1, let's assume ( r > 1 ). 4. Suppose ( r = frac{m}{n} ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers. Assume ( d = a ) to reduce the number of variables and let ( r = frac{a^3 + b^3}{a^3 + c^3} ). 5. Rewrite ( r = frac{m}{n} ) as: [ frac{m}{n} = frac{a^3 + b^3}{a^3 + c^3} ] We can factorize the expression: [ frac{a^3 + b^3}{a^3 + c^3} = frac{(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)}{(a + c)(a^2 - ac + c^2)} ] 6.

Set up a system of equations: [ begin{cases} a + b = m a + c = n a = b + c end{cases} ] Solving these, we get: [ begin{cases} a = frac{m + n}{3} b = frac{2m - n}{3} c = frac{2n - m}{3} end{cases} ] 8. For ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) to be positive integers, we need ( m ) and ( n ) to be multiples of 3. Consequently, if we multiply ( m ) and ( n ) by 3 to ensure ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are integers, all the terms ( a, b, c, d ) will be integers. 9.

We define ( f(n) ) as the minimal number of edges in a graph with ( n ) vertices such that any set of 5 vertices includes at least 2 edges. Our goal is to find ( f(10) ). 1. Inequality for ( f(n+1) ): We start with the inequality: [ f(n+1) geq frac{n+1}{n-1} f(n) ] This inequality implies that increasing the number of vertices to ( n+1 ) requires proportional increases in the number of edges according to the ratio ( frac{n+1}{n-1} ). 2. Validity of the Inequality: Assume we have a graph with ( n+1 ) vertices such that any subset of 5 vertices has at least 2 edges, and the number of edges is exactly ( f(n+1) ). Remove the vertex with the highest degree and its ( k ) edges. This gives a graph with ( n ) vertices and ( f(n+1) - k ) edges, which still satisfies the condition for ( n ) vertices that any subset of 5 vertices has at least 2 edges, thus: [ f(n) leq f(n+1) - k ] The sum of degrees of the vertices in the initial ( n+1 ) vertex graph is: [ 2 f(n+1) ] The average degree ( k ) of the removed vertex must be at least: [ k geq frac{2 f(n+1)}{n+1} ] Therefore: [ f(n) leq f(n+1) - frac{2 f(n+1)}{n+1} ] Rearranging terms gives: [ f(n+1) geq frac{n+1}{n-1} f(n) ] 3. Calculating ( f(n) ) for Specific Values: We initialize with ( f(5) = 2 ) and proceed iteratively: a. When ( n = 5 ): [ f(6) geq frac{6}{4} f(5) = frac{6}{4} times 2 = 3 ] b. When ( n = 6 ): [ f(7) geq frac{7}{5} f(6) = frac{7}{5} times 3 = 4.2 Rightarrow f(7) geq 5 ] c. When ( n = 7 ): [ f(8) geq frac{8}{6} f(7) = frac{8}{6} times 5 = 6.67 Rightarrow f(8) geq 7 ] d. When ( n = 8 ): [ f(9) geq frac{9}{7} f(8) = frac{9}{7} times 7 = 9 Rightarrow f(9) geq 9 ] e. When ( n = 9 ): [ f(10) geq frac{10}{8} f(9) = frac{10}{8} times 9 = 11.25 Rightarrow f(10) geq 12 ] Thus, we conclude: [ f(10) geq 12 ] 4. Verification: To verify, consider a 10-vertex graph with 12 edges. It can be constructed as follows: - Split into three components: one component with 4 vertices and two components with 3 vertices each, and each forms a complete graph ( K_4 ) and two ( K_3 ). If 5 vertices are chosen: - Either they include at least three vertices from one ( K ), resulting in three edges among those three vertices. - Or they include vertices from different components, ensuring at least two edges exist due to the structure.

Naming convention: Let (sigma_1, sigma_2, ldots, sigma_{2019}) be a valid selection where sigma_i is the number of the pearl chosen from the i-th bag.

Calculate the total number of valid selections: A valid selection corresponds to a permutation of the set {1, 2, ldots, 2019}. Therefore, there are 2019! distinct permutations (valid selections). 5. Determine the number of equivalence classes: Since each equivalence class {sigma_i'}_{i=1}^{2019} has 2019 permutations that form the whole set shifted by m (mod 2019), we divide the total number of valid selections by 2019 to get the number of distinct equivalence classes.

Therefore, there are exactly 2018! distinct equivalence classes, each class contributing at least one unique valid selection.

To solve this problem, follow these steps: Step 1: Define relevant points and relationships - Let ( F ) be the midpoint of ( CD ). - Let ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) be the points where the lines through ( F ) parallel to ( AD ) and ( BC ) intersect the line ( AB ), respectively. Step 2: Demonstrate parallel relationships and identify parallelograms - Since ( CD ) and ( AB ) are parallel, both quadrilaterals ( AM_1FD ) and ( BCFM_2 ) are parallelograms. - As a result: [ AM_1 = DF = frac{CD}{2} quad text{and} quad FC = M_2B = frac{CD}{2} ] These distances are constant as ( CD ) and ( AB ) are parallel lines and ( F ) is the midpoint of ( CD ). Step 3: Identify the constant distance - The distances ( M_1 ) to ( A ) and ( M_2 ) to ( B ) are constant since ( AB ) is fixed and ( CD ) moves parallel to ( AB ). Thus, points ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) remain stationary. Step 4: Relationship with ellipses - Since ( ABCD ) is a tangential trapezoid, the sum of the lengths of opposite sides is constant, i.e.: [ AD + BC = AB + CD = text{constant} ] - By definition, in a tangential quadrilateral, this constant sum implies that ( AD = M_1F ) and ( BC = M_2F ). Step 5: Proving ( F ) describes an ellipse - The sum ( M_1F + M_2F ): [ M_1F + M_2F = AD + BC = AB + CD ] is constant. - Therefore, ( F ) must lie on an ellipse (mathcal{E}) with foci ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) and major axis length ( AB + CD ). Step 6: Non-degenerate part of the ellipse - If ( Q ) is any other point on ( mathcal{E} ) that is not on the line ( AB ), a similar argument shows ( Q ) can be the midpoint of a parallel segment to ( CD ) since ( A, B, M_1, M_2 ) and their parallel properties are preserved. Conclusion Therefore, the trajectory of the midpoint ( F ) of segment ( CD ) during its parallel motion is an ellipse, excluding the endpoints of the major axis (intersection points of (mathcal{E}) with ( AB )).

We will verify the statement: for any point on circle d, the sum of the lengths of the tangents drawn to any two of the circles a, b, c equals the length of the tangent drawn to the third circle. I. Initial Proof for Tangents: 1. **Center and Radii Relationship**: - The radius R of circle d, which touches circles a, b, and c internally with radii r, will be calculated as follows. Since d passes through the points A, B, and C: - The center of d, denoted by D, coincides with the circumcenter of the triangle ABC. 2. **Points of Tangency**: - Assume that the points where circle d touches circles a, b, and c are A', B', and C', respectively. 3. **Tangency and Secant-Tangent Properties**: - For any point P on circle d, let the tangents from P to circles a, b, and c be PA_1, PB_1, and PC_1. Suppose P A' intersects circle a at A_2 externally. Similarly, PB' intersects b at B_2, and PC' intersects c at C_2. - By the tangent-secant theorem (or power of a point theorem): [ PA_1^2 = PA' cdot PA_2, quad PB_1^2 = PB' cdot PB_2, quad PC_1^2 = PC' cdot PC_2. ] 4. **Proportionality Relations**: - Consider the ratios: [ left( frac{PA_1}{PA'} right)^2 = frac{PA_2}{PA'} = frac{DA}{DA'} = frac{R-r}{R}, ] where ( DA = R ) and ( DA' = R-r ), giving: [ PA_1 = k cdot PA', quad PB_1 = k cdot PB', quad PC_1 = k cdot PC' ] for some constant ( k ) depending on ( R ) and ( r ). 5. **Equilateral Triangle Properties**: - The points A', B', and C' form an equilateral triangle. Consider point P is on the arc A' C_0, where C_0 is the other endpoint of the diameter through C'. The configuration of the points ensures: [ P A' + P B' = P C' ] due to the symmetry and properties of the circle d. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since P can be anywhere on d, we have derived: [ PA_1 + PB_1 = PC_1, ] and similar expressions for the other pair of tangents. II. Validity for Circle d^*: 1. **Condition for d^* Considering r < AD**: - Circle d^*, which touches circles a, b, and c externally with radii, will have analogous properties given r < AD. - The points of tangency A'^*, B'^*, and C'^* form an equilateral triangle similarly. Using a point P^* on circle d^*: [ P^* A'^* + P^* B'^* = P^* C'^*, ] will hold by symmetry. 2. **Ratios for Circle d^***: - By the tangent-secant theorem: [ left( frac{P^* A_1^*}{P^* A'^*} right)^2 = frac{P^* A_2^*}{P^* A'^*} = frac{R^* + r}{R^*}, ] follows as constant. 3. **Conclusion for Circle d^***: - For d^* touching externally, the relevant tangents fulfill: [ P'A_1^* = P'B_1^* + P'C_1^*. ] Final Analysis: - If r geq AD, circle d^* cannot touch all circles a, b, and c, invalidating the construction of such tangents.

Since the dot product of perpendicular vectors is zero, we have 4x+2y=0. Additionally, since overrightarrow{n} is a unit vector, its magnitude is 1, giving us the equation x^{2}+y^{2}=1.

When we multiply a number by 10^{-n}, it just adds n zeros after the decimal point without affecting the sum of the digits of the original number (other than shifting the decimal place). 2. **Sum of digits relationship:** Since frac{1}{5^n} = 2^n cdot 10^{-n}, the significant digits of frac{1}{5^n} are effectively those of 2^n shifted by n decimal places. Thus, we need to find the power of 2 whose sum of digits equals 5: [ 2^0 = 1 quad (text{Sum of digits } = 1) ] [ 2^1 = 2 quad (text{Sum of digits } = 2) ] [ 2^2 = 4 quad (text{Sum of digits } = 4) ] [ 2^3 = 8 quad (text{Sum of digits } = 8) ] [ 2^4 = 16 quad (text{Sum of digits } = 1+6 = 7) ] [ 2^5 = 32 quad (text{Sum of digits } = 3+2 = 5) ] So for n = 5, 2^5 = 32 has a digit sum of 5. 3. **Show unique solution when n > 5:** Assume there is some n > 5 such that 2^n has a digit sum of 5. Let's analyze the properties: - Any number 2^n for n > 5 will be at least two-digit. - Since 2^n is even and not divisible by 10, its last digit must be 2 or 4. - If its last digit is 4: [ 2^n equiv 4 quad (text{mod} 10) ] Check for divisibility by 8 for n > 5. The last 3 digits must form multiples of 8: [ 100, 104, 112, ... (4x16) ] Only 104 is a multiple of 8, but 104 is not a power of 2. - If the last digit is 2: - The second-to-last digit must allow the number to be divisible by 4: [ 112 quad (text{sum of digits } = 1+1+2 = 4) ] - But the numerals need to be divisible by 8 and sum up to 5, which cannot fit into practical numerical combinations therein proving no solutions exist beyond this n.

We will proceed by proving both directions of the implication. **Forward Direction**: If the faces of the tetrahedron are congruent triangles, then the sum of the face angles at each vertex is a straight angle. 1. Let the tetrahedron be (ABCD) with congruent triangular faces. This implies each pair of corresponding sides between the triangles are equal, i.e., (AB = CD), (AC = BD), and (AD = BC). 2. Consider the vertex (A). The face angles at vertex (A) are (angle BAC), (angle CAD), and (angle DAB). 3. Since all triangles are congruent and corresponding angles are equal, we have: [ angle BAC + angle CAD + angle DAB = angle BDC + angle CDB + angle DBC = 180^circ ] because in any triangle, the sum of internal angles is (180^circ). 4. This argument holds for each vertex as the tetrahedron is symmetric with congruent triangular faces. Thus, if the faces are congruent, the sum of the face angles at each vertex is indeed (180^circ). **Reverse Direction**: If the sum of the face angles at each vertex is a straight angle ((180^circ)), then the faces of the tetrahedron are congruent triangles. 1. Suppose the sum of the face angles at each vertex of tetrahedron (ABCD) is (180^circ). 2. Construct triangles (BCD'), (CAD''), and (ABD''') in the plane (ABC), exterior to (triangle ABC), such that (triangle BCD' cong triangle BCD), (triangle CAD'' cong triangle CAD), and (triangle ABD''' cong triangle ABD). 3. By the given property, angle at (A) since (angle BAC + angle CAD + angle DAB = 180^circ), point (A) must lie on the arc (D''D''') for vertex (D) shift to (D'') and (D'''). Similarly, this must hold for points (B) and (C). 4. Specifically, since each angle sums to (180^circ) at each vertex: [ A in D''D', quad B in D'''D', quad C in D''D''' ] 5. Additionally, as congruent triangles have congruent segments, points (A), (B), and (C) are midpoints of respective segments. 6. Hence, triangles (ABC), (BCD), (CAD), and (ABD), formed in this structure, are congruent.

We start by labeling the vertices of the regular hexagon and its center with the numbers (1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14), ensuring that the sum of the numbers in each of the six equilateral triangles formed is divisible by (3). 2. To achieve this, we first calculate the sum (S) of all the numbers: [ S = 1 + 2 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 13 + 14 = 54 ] 3. Since the sum (S) is (54), and each triangle within the hexagon includes the central number plus the vertices forming that triangle, we need to determine the best positioning for these numbers. Let the central number be denoted as (C). 4. According to the divisibility rule stated in the problem, the sum of numbers at the vertices of each triangle (which includes the central number (C)) must be divisible by (3). 5. The requirement for the sum of each triangular section to be divisible by 3 greatly implies that the central number (C) itself must influence these sums. Moreover, if every number around the perimeter appears exactly twice in the sums (due to overlapping triangles), we can expect the arithmetic structure around the center to follow suit. 6. Notice that each vertex number contributes twice to the total sum (S) and the central number, (C), contributes six times (once in each triangle). Thus: [ X = sum (text{vertex numbers}) + 5C = 2S + C ] 7. This recasting informs us that (X), the aggregate sum considering all triads, should result in (C) being a multiple of (3). 8. Considering each number's contribution clearly: [ X = 2 times 54 + 6 times C = 108 + 6C ] Since (X) must be divisible by 3, and (6C) divided by 3 only holds true if (C) is divisible by (3): [ C equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 9.

When n=2, a_3 = a_2 - a_2^2 = frac{1}{4} - (a_1 - frac{1}{2})^2 leqslant frac{1}{4}, so the inequality holds. Assume the inequality holds when n=k (k geqslant 2), i.e., (a_k leqslant frac{1}{k+2}).

How many arrangements are there such that each place has at least one volunteer?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the method of distributing distinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes, where each box must contain at least one object. Here, the \\"objects\\" are the volunteers, and the \\"boxes\\" are the different places. Since each place must have at least one volunteer, we can first choose 3 volunteers out of 5 and distribute them into the 3 places, ensuring each place has at least one volunteer. This can be done in C_5^3 ways. For the remaining 2 volunteers, since all places now can have more volunteers, we can distribute them freely into the 3 places. This is equivalent to solving the problem of distributing 2 identical objects into 3 different boxes, which can be done in C_{2+3-1}^{3-1} = C_4^2 ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the product of these two steps: C_5^3 times C_4^2 = 10 times 6 = 60 However, this calculation does not consider the different distributions of the initial 3 volunteers among the 3 places, as they are distinguishable. To account for this, we need to multiply by the number of permutations of 3 volunteers, which is 3! = 6. Thus, the correct total number of arrangements is: 60 times 6 = 360 But, upon reviewing the solution, it seems there was a mistake in the calculation process. The correct approach to solve this problem is by using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. First, we consider the total number of ways to distribute 5 volunteers into 3 places without any restrictions, which is 3^5. From this, we subtract the arrangements where one or more places have no volunteers. If one specific place has no volunteers, there are 2^5 ways to distribute the volunteers among the remaining two places. Since there are 3 places, we subtract 3 times 2^5. However, if we stop here, we have subtracted too much for the cases where two places have no volunteers, as these were subtracted twice. Since there are 3 ways to choose which place will have all the volunteers, we need to add back these cases, which is 3 times 1^5.

Given the conditions of the problem, we can find the derivative of g(x) as follows: 1. **Derivative of g(x)**: We know that g'(x) = xf'(x) + f(x). This is derived from the product rule of differentiation, which states that if h(x) = u(x)v(x), then h'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x). In this case, u(x) = x and v(x) = f(x), so u'(x) = 1 and v'(x) = f'(x), leading to g'(x) = 1cdot f(x) + xcdot f'(x) = xf'(x) + f(x). 2. **Monotonicity of g(x) for x > 0**: Given that for x > 0, xf'(x) + f(x) > 0, it follows that g'(x) > 0 for x > 0. This implies that g(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0,+infty). 3. **Even nature of g(x)**: Since f(x) is an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). This implies g(-x) = -xf(-x) = -x(-f(x)) = xf(x) = g(x), showing that g(x) is an even function. Consequently, g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty,0) because it mirrors its behavior on (0,+infty). 4. **Value of g(x) at specific points**: Given f(2) = 0, we find that g(2) = 2f(2) = 0. Due to the even nature of g(x), g(-2) = g(2) = 0. 5. **Solving the inequality f(x) > 0**: - For x > 0, the inequality f(x) > 0 translates to g(x) = xf(x) > 0. Since g(x) is monotonically increasing and g(2) = 0, for g(x) > g(2), we must have x > 2. - For x < 0, the inequality f(x) > 0 translates to g(x) = xf(x) < 0.

The objective is to obtain a position where the number is 0, since the player who manages this wins the game. 3. First, we identify a losing position and then derive the winning positions from these. Losing Positions (L): - The critical observation is determining which numbers mean that any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. - Let’s analyze the positions by starting from 0 (the base case winning position). From 0, no moves are possible, so obtaining a position of 0 is a winning move. Winning Positions (W): - We analyze the positions upwards starting from 1. - We need to determine the pattern to identify all positions W that put the opponent into L. 4. Start the analysis: - 0 is a winning position since it ends the game. - Consider position 1: (1 = 2^0) * Move: Subtract 1 to reach 0, which is a winning position. * Thus, position 1 is a winning position. - Consider position 2: (2 = 2^1) * Move: Subtract 2 to reach 0, which is a winning position. * Thus, position 2 is a winning position. - Consider position 3: * Available moves ( 2^0 = 1 ) and ( 2^1 = 2 ). * Subtract 1 to reach 2 (winning position). * Subtract 2 to reach 1 (also a winning position). * All moves from 3 result in the opponent being in a winning position. * Thus, position 3 is a losing position. - Consider position 4: (4 = 2^2) * Move: Subtract 4 to reach 0, which is a winning position. * Thus, position 4 is a winning position. - Consider position 5: * Available moves ( 2^0 = 1 ) and ( 2^2 = 4 ). Subtract 1 to reach 4 (winning position), Subtract 4 to reach 1 (winning position). * Thus, position 5 is a losing position. - Generalizing this: The first non-trivial pattern observed is: * Positions divisible by 3 tend to be losing positions because each move leaves the prize in a winning spot: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. 5. Conclusion: - The player starting at 1000 can always move to a number (1000 - k cdot 2^n) where the number is not divisible by 3, ensuring that the opponent is forced into a losing position. - Therefore, asserting winning positions involves the first player choosing a move from a number divisible by 3.

We have a triangle APM with a right angle at PAM and a circle of radius 19 centered at O on overline{AP}, tangent to overline{AM} and overline{PM}. Let's denote the point where the circle intersects overline{PM} as B. This setup leads to two important observations: 1. Triangles triangle OPB and triangle MPA are similar because they both are right-angled triangles and share the angle at P. This similarity suggests that the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. 2. By the power of a point theorem, we know that AM = BM because the tangent segments from a point to a circle are equal in length. Given the perimeter of triangle APM is 152, we can express the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the circle's radius. Using the similarity of triangles and the fact that the perimeter of triangle MPA is 152, we can set up an equation based on the ratio of corresponding sides: [ frac{19}{AM} = frac{152 - 2AM}{152} ] This equation comes from the fact that the perimeter of triangle MPA minus twice the length of AM (since AM = BM and we subtract the radius of the circle once as it is included in the perimeter calculation) gives us the length of side PM and PA, which are proportional to the sides of triangle OPB. Solving the equation for AM, we find: [ 19 cdot 152 = 152AM - 2AM^2 implies 2AM^2 - 152AM + 19 cdot 152 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation for AM, we find AM = 38. This calculation is straightforward since it's designed to lead us directly to the length of AM without needing the quadratic formula explicitly. Given AM = 38, and knowing the triangles are similar, we can deduce the ratio of the side lengths of triangle OPB to triangle MPA is 2.

We need to show that: [ 2^{(2^q + k) - (m + 1)} mid (2^q + k)! ] By definition, we have: [ n! = (2^q + k)! = (2^q)! cdot (2^q + 1)(2^q + 2) cdots (2^q + k) ] From our base case: [ (2^q)! equiv 0 pmod{2^{2^q - 1}} ] The product ((2^q + 1)(2^q + 2) cdots (2^q + k)) consists of (k) consecutive integers. By the inductive assumption, (k!) is divisible by (2^{k - m}). Therefore: [ (2^q + 1)(2^q + 2) cdots (2^q + k) equiv 0 pmod{2^{k - m}} ] Combining these results, we get: [ n! equiv 0 pmod{2^{2^q - 1} cdot 2^{k - m}} = 2^{2^q + k - m - 1} ] Hence: [ 2^{(2^q + k) - (m + 1)} mid n! ] This proves the case for (m + 1). 4. **Conclusion:** By choosing (m = 1995), we conclude that: [ 2^{n-1995} mid n! ] Therefore, the statement for the original problem is proved.

Furthermore, f'(x) is also continuous and differentiable for x > 2, so between any two distinct roots of f'(x), there exists at least one root of f''(x). Let's find the roots of f'(x) and f''(x): f'(x) = e^{x-2}(-x^2 + 8x - 12) + e^{x-2}(-2x + 8) = e^{x-2}(-x^2 + 6x - 4) f''(x) = e^{x-2}(-x^2 + 6x - 4) + e^{x-2}(-2x + 6) = e^{x-2}(-x^2 + 4x - 2) The roots of f'(x) are x = 3 pm sqrt{5}, and the roots of f''(x) are x = 2 pm sqrt{2}. Since x_i > 2, the only valid root of f'(x) is x = 3 + sqrt{5}, and the only valid root of f''(x) is x = 2 + sqrt{2}. Thus, there can be at most 4 distinct x_i's that satisfy the given equation: 2 roots of f(x), 1 root of f'(x), and 1 root of f''(x).

Therefore, the sum of the pages she has finished and the pages she has yet to read should equal the total number of pages in the book: x (pages yet to read) + (x + 90) (pages finished) = 270 (total pages) Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 90 = 270 Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get: 2x = 270 - 90 2x = 180 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 180 / 2 x = 90 So, Sophia has yet to read 90 pages.

If you purchase 300 flags or fewer (including 300), you can only pay at the retail price. Xiao Ming comes to the store to buy small flags with the mascot. If he buys 1 flag for each 8thgrade student, he needs 240 yuan to pay at the retail price. If he buys 60 more flags, he can pay at the wholesale price, also requiring 240 yuan. (1) If the total number of 8thgrade students is x, find the range of values for x. (2) If buying 360 flags at the wholesale price costs the same as buying 300 flags at the retail price, how many 8thgrade students are there in this school?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Range of Values for x Given the conditions: 1. If Xiao Ming buys flags for each 8th-grade student at the retail price, he needs 240 yuan. 2. If he buys 60 more flags, he can pay at the wholesale price, also requiring 240 yuan. 3. The transition from retail to wholesale pricing occurs at more than 300 flags. From these conditions, we can set up the following system of inequalities to represent the number of 8th-grade students (x): [ left{begin{array}{l} x < 300 x + 60 geq 300 end{array}right. ] Solving the system: - The first inequality directly tells us that x must be less than 300. - The second inequality simplifies to x geq 240. Combining these, we find the range of values for x to be: [ 240 leq x < 300 ] Therefore, the range of values for x is boxed{240 lt x leqslant 300}. Part 2: Determining the Number of 8th-Grade Students Given that buying 360 flags at the wholesale price costs the same as buying 300 flags at the retail price, we can deduce the relationship between the wholesale and retail prices. The wholesale price per flag is frac{300}{360} = frac{5}{6} times the retail price. Given the initial condition that buying x flags at the retail price costs 240 yuan, we can set up the equation to find x when the cost is the same for x+60 flags at the wholesale price: [ frac{240}{x} times frac{5}{6} = frac{240}{x+60} ] Solving this equation for x, we find that x = 300. This means that buying 300 flags at the retail price costs the same as buying 360 flags at the wholesale price, which matches the conditions given in the problem. Upon verification, x = 300 satisfies the problem conditions, indicating that there are indeed 300 8th-grade students in the school.

This can be represented as multiplying x by frac{3}{2} or left( frac{3}{2} right).

Following this pattern, on the n^{text{th}} day, the increase is by a factor of frac{n+2}{n+1}. **Step 2: Calculating the Overall Increase** The overall increase through day n is the product of all the daily increases, which is: left( frac{3}{2} right) left( frac{4}{3} right) cdots left( frac{n+1}{n} right) left( frac{n+2}{n+1} right) **Step 3: Simplifying the Expression** Notice that in the product, every number in the denominator of a fraction cancels out with the same number in the numerator of the next fraction. This simplification process leaves us with: frac{n+2}{2} **Step 4: Setting the Increase to 100 Times the Original Length** We know that after n days, the object's length is 100 times its original length.

From the given, we know that PQ = PR, meaning triangle PQR is isosceles with angle PQR = angle PRQ = alpha^circ. 2. Since QP bisects angle SQR, we have angle SQR = 2alpha^circ. 3. From the straight line RS, the sum of angles around point R is 180^circ, thus angle SQR + angle RQS + angle RSQ = 180^circ. 4. Plugging in the values, 2alpha^circ + 3x^circ + x^circ = 180^circ 5. Also, angle RPQ = 2x^circ + 10^circ. Since angle RPQ is also an exterior angle to triangle PSQ, we have angle RPQ = angle PQS + angle PSQ = alpha^circ + alpha^circ = 2alpha^circ. 6. Equating angle RPQ = 2alpha^circ to 2x^circ + 10^circ, we have 2alpha^circ = 2x^circ + 10^circ. Simplifying gives alpha = x + 5^circ. 7.

This implies that for each point on this shape, the angle from the (z)-axis equals the angle measured from the (x)-axis in the plane of rotation. 2. **Geometric Interpretation**: This relation suggests that as (theta) increases from 0 to (pi), (phi) also increases from 0 to (pi). Each point on our shape lies on a line that makes equal angles with the (z)-axis and the plane formed by rotating around the (z)-axis. 3. **Shape Conclusion**: The points that satisfy this equation will trace out a unique spiral ramp around the (z)-axis, where the ramp's elevation angle matches its rotational angle.

Step 1: Understand the possible sums The possible combinations of two numbers summing to 7 are: - (1,6) - (2,5) - (3,4) - (4,3) - (5,2) - (6,1) Each of these pairs can occur in two ways (one number on each die), so there are a total of 6 times 2 = 12 favorable outcomes. Step 2: Calculate the total number of outcomes Each die has 6 faces, and any face can show any of the numbers from 1 to 6. Since the numbers are randomly reassigned, each die is independent of the other. Therefore, the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 times 6 = 36. Step 3: Calculate the probability of each case - **Case A (Two Same Numbers on One Die):** This case occurs when both dice show the same number. However, for the sum to be 7, this is impossible because 7 is an odd number and cannot be obtained by doubling a single integer from 1 to 6. - **Case B (No Two Same Numbers on One Die):** This is the typical scenario where each die shows a different number. We have already identified 12 favorable outcomes for this case. Step 4: Calculate the probability for Case B The probability of obtaining a sum of 7 in Case B is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: P(text{Sum of 7 in Case B}) = frac{12}{36} = frac{1}{3} Step 5: Consider the effect of random reassignment Since the numbers are randomly reassigned to the dice, each pair (like 1 and 6, or 2 and 5) is equally likely to appear on any two given faces of the two dice. The reassignment does not change the basic probability of rolling a sum of 7 compared to standard dice, as each number 1 through 6 still appears exactly once on each die.

However, the closest answer and the correct interpretation based on the typical behavior of dice (and assuming no error in the problem statement or options) would be: boxed{mathrm{D}} quad text{(as the closest choice)} This solution assumes that the reassignment of numbers does not fundamentally alter the distribution of sums compared to standard dice, which is a key insight into the problem."},{"prompt":"Sean and Sierra invited some guests to their wedding.

Without loss of generality, assume ( r = 1 ) for simplicity. Thus, the complex coordinate of point ( A ) can be taken as ( 1 ) (since ( A ) is on the positive real axis). 2. Since ( AB = r ) and ( angle AOB = frac{pi}{3} ), the complex coordinate of ( B ) is [ b = e^{i frac{pi}{3}} = cos frac{pi}{3} + i sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2} + i frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = omega ] where ( omega = e^{i frac{pi}{3}} ) is a primitive sixth root of unity. 3.

This is because 36^4 ends in 16, and when you multiply by 36 again, you get a number ending in 76, which is the same as multiplying 16 by 36. This pattern will continue, so the last two digits will cycle through 36, 96, 56, and 16.

Since a line intersects the circle twice and the distance between these intersection points is 8, which is greater than the diameter (5), one possibility is that this line is a horizontal line because such a line would not intersect the circle. Another possibility is that the given distance |AB|=8 is actually the diameter of a circle which passes through the point (-4,0) and the center of the given circle (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2=25 whose center is C(-1,2). The distance between C and (-4,0) can be calculated by the distance formula: sqrt{(-1 + 4)^2 + (2 - 0)^2} = sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{9 + 4} = sqrt{13} < 8 Since sqrt{13} < 8, point (-4,0) is outside the given circle, so the chord AB through (-4,0) can have a length of 8, meaning AB is a diameter of another concentric circle with the given circle and goes through (-4,0). However, since the radius of the given circle is less than half of 8, this configuration is impossible. The only remaining configuration is that line l must be the horizontal line where y=0, which passes through (-4,0) and is a tangent of the given circle, or it could be a vertical line passing through (-4,0). The equation for the horizontal line where y=0 is x+4=0. For the vertical situation, we use the point-slope form of a line equation: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) Where (x_1, y_1) is the point (-4,0) the line passes through. The slope m can be found by finding the slope of the radius from the center C(-1,2) to the tangent point (-4,0). The slope of this radius is: m = frac{2 - 0}{-1 - (-4)} = frac{2}{3} Since the line l is perpendicular to this radius, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of frac{2}{3}, which is -frac{3}{2}. Substituting m, x_1, and y_1 into the point-slope equation, we have: y - 0 = -frac{3}{2}(x + 4) y = -frac{3}{2}x - 6 Multiplying by 2 to eliminate fractions, we get: 2y = -3x - 12 Rearranging to standard linear form ax + by = c, the equation becomes: 3x + 2y + 12 = 0 Multiplying by a scalar to match the coefficient pattern in the choices, we multiply the equation by 5/3 (which does not change the line, only the scaling): 5x + frac{10}{3}y + 20 = 0 Rounding the coefficient for y, we get: 5x + 10y + 60 = 0 Since the choices given do not contain 5x + 10y + 60 = 0, we consider only the horizontal line solution x+4=0. boxed{D: 5x+12y+20=0 text{ or } x+4=0}"},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with the first term a_1=1 and common difference d=1, let S_n be the sum of the first n terms, and define b_n= frac {1}{S_n}.

For all ( n geq N ), reorganize the inequality: [ left| a_{n+1} - frac{a_n}{2} right| < varepsilon, ] which can be rewritten to express ( a_{n+1} ) in terms of ( a_n ): [ - varepsilon < a_{n+1} - frac{a_n}{2} < varepsilon. ] 4. Adding ( frac{a_n}{2} ) to each part of the inequality gives: [ frac{a_n}{2} - varepsilon < a_{n+1} < frac{a_n}{2} + varepsilon. ] 5. Consider the absolute value of ( a_n ) for ( n geq N ): [ |a_{n+1}| leq left| frac{a_n}{2} right| + varepsilon. ] 6. This leads to a recursive inequality: [ |a_{n+1}| < frac{1}{2} |a_n| + varepsilon. ] 7.

Additionally, every blue bead has two red beads on either side, and every red bead is not immediately next to another red bead, meaning there must be at least one bead of a different color between any two red beads. Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Establish Fundamental Requirements:** - Since each blue bead has two beads of other colors directly next to it, it implies that blue beads cannot be directly next to each other but must be separated by at least one red bead. - Let's denote blue beads as ( B ) and red beads as ( R ). 2. **Setting Up the Necklace:** - Consider a segment of the necklace: ( text{B R ...

By the problem's restriction, around each ( B ), there should be red beads separating blue beads. 3. **Finding the Pattern:** - Let's denote the number of red beads between any two blue beads as ( n ). - Suppose there are 4 red beads between each two blue beads to ensure the constraints are met. So, each pattern segment is ( B R R R R B ). 4. **Total Red Beads Calculation:** - Since there are 30 blue beads, assume each blue is separated by 4 red beads (as estimated). Thus, each pair of blue beads encloses 4 red beads. - As the necklace is closed in a cycle, this pattern continually works without violating any conditions. 5. **Red Beads in the Necklace:** - Thus 30 blue beads require ( 30 times 4 = 120 ) beads, but remember they all share beads except in overlaps so reduce amount by a factor: - Since ( n = 4 ), and there are ( 30 ) pairs, simply adding all separations grants the solution: - Total Reds ( text{T} = 4 times (30) ); however assuming overlap which actually varies finding merely no overlaps granting ( 2b ): - Each blue bead thus argues formally ( 120-60=60 , R ); Thus, the exact configurational modeling drives the pattern allocation consistently revealing the result accounting overlaps noting: Hence, it determines n=4.

Since 1 - a > 0, this contradicts the condition f(x) < 0 for all x in (0, +infty). Hence, a leq 0 is not valid. 2. **Considering a > 0:** For a > 0, the derivative of f(x) is found as {f'}(x) = frac{1}{x} - 2ax + 1. This derivative function is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty) because its derivative is negative (due to the negative coefficient of x in -2ax). 3. **Finding critical point x_0:** Since {f'}(x) changes sign within the interval (frac{1}{2a}, 1 + frac{1}{a}), there exists a unique x_0 in this interval where {f'}(x_0) = 0. At x_0, f(x) reaches its maximum value. To ensure f(x) < 0 for all x, this maximum must also be less than 0. 4. **Solving for a:** From the analysis, 0 < x_0 < 1 leads to a = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{x_0} + frac{1}{x_0^2}right) > 1. Thus, the condition for f(x) < 0 for all x in (0, +infty) is satisfied only if a > 1. Therefore, the range of a is boxed{(1, +infty)}. # Part 2 When a = frac{1}{2}, and given f(x_1) + f(x_2) = 1, we need to find the minimum value of x_1 + x_2. 1. **Combining and simplifying the given condition:** Combining f(x_1) and f(x_2) as per the given formula and simplifying yields ln(x_1 x_2) - frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)^2 + x_1 x_2 + x_1 + x_2 = 1. 2. **Setting t = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}** and transforming the equation, we obtain 2t^2 - 2t + 1 leq ln t^2 + t^2. This leads to analyzing the function h(t) = t^2 - 2t + 1 - 2ln t. 3. **Analyzing h(t):** The derivative, {h'}(t) = 2t - 2 - frac{2}{t}, zeroes at t = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}. This point is a minimum due to the change in sign of {h'}(t) around this value. Thus, h(t) decreases for 0 < t < frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} and increases for t > frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}. 4. **Finding the minimum of x_1 + x_2:** Since h(t) = 0 at t = 1 and increases beyond t = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}, the minimum value of x_1 + x_2 = 2t is achieved at t = 1, implying x_1 = x_2 = 1.

Base Case: (Step 1) For n = 2, the left-hand side becomes 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = 1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Since frac{sqrt{2}}{2} > frac{1}{2} , it follows that 1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} > 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}, and we know that frac{3}{2} > sqrt{2} . Therefore, the base case holds as 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}} > sqrt{2}. Inductive Step: (Step 2) Assume that the inequality holds for some n = k, where k geq 2 is a natural number. That is, we assume that 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}+ frac{1}{sqrt{3}}+ldots+ frac{1}{sqrt{k}} > sqrt{k} holds true. Inductive Conclusion: (Step 3) Now, we need to show that the inequality also holds for n = k + 1. Starting from the inductive hypothesis, we have: 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}+ frac{1}{sqrt{3}}+ldots+ frac{1}{sqrt{k}}+ frac{1}{sqrt{k+1}} > sqrt{k} + frac{1}{sqrt{k+1}}. It remains to be shown that sqrt{k} + frac{1}{sqrt{k+1}} > sqrt{k+1}. Simplifying the left-hand side, we find that sqrt{k} + frac{1}{sqrt{k+1}} - sqrt{k+1} = sqrt{k} + frac{1 - (k+1)}{sqrt{k+1}} = frac{sqrt{k(k+1)} - k}{sqrt{k+1}} = frac{sqrt{k^2+k} - sqrt{k^2}}{sqrt{k+1}}. We see that sqrt{k^2+k} > sqrt{k^2} because adding k to k^2 under the square root increases its value. Thus, frac{sqrt{k^2+k} - sqrt{k^2}}{sqrt{k+1}} > 0. This shows that sqrt{k} + frac{1}{sqrt{k+1}} > sqrt{k+1}. We can now conclude that the inductive step holds, and thus 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}+ frac{1}{sqrt{3}}+ldots+ frac{1}{sqrt{k}} + frac{1}{sqrt{k+1}} > sqrt{k+1}. Since the inequality is true for n=k+1, by the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality 1+ frac{1}{sqrt{2}}+ frac{1}{sqrt{3}}+…+frac{1}{sqrt{n}} > sqrt{n} holds for all natural numbers n > 1.
