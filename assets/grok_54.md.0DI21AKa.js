The total number of eggs laid per day from Monday to Saturday is 18 (chickens) + 8 (ducks) + 2 (geese) = 28 eggs.

When his wife meets him and they arrive home 30 minutes earlier than usual, it means they saved 30 minutes on the usual driving time. Let's denote the time the man spent walking as W. When the wife meets him, they save the remaining driving time that she would have spent if she had driven all the way to the station and then back home with him. Since they saved 30 minutes, it means the wife would have spent 30 minutes more driving to the station and then back to the point where she met the man. So, the time the man spent walking (W) is equal to the time the wife would have spent driving to the station (T) minus the 30 minutes they saved by meeting early (since she didn't have to drive that last bit to the station and back to the meeting point). Therefore, W = T - 30 minutes. Since the wife drives the same amount of time to the station as it takes to get back home, and they arrived home 30 minutes earlier than usual, the man must have walked for the same amount of time that the wife would have driven, which is 30 minutes.

These squares are the ones immediately to the left, directly below, and diagonally below-left of the target square. We label these squares as \\"1.\\" 2. **Marking Losing Positions:** - From these winning positions, we can find the losing positions for the opponent. - A losing position is any position where all possible moves would lead to a winning position for the opponent. - For example, if the piece is on a square from where any move puts it on a \\"1\\"-marked square (winning position), then this square is a losing position. Mark these squares as \\"2.\\" 3. **Iterate for Further Positions:** - Repeat the process for identifying winning and losing positions: - Squares from which any move leads to a \\"2\\" (losing position) are winning positions, and we mark them with \\"3.\\" - Squares from which any move leads to a \\"3\\" (winning position) are losing positions, and we mark them with \\"4.\\" - Continue this process until all squares on the board are marked appropriately as either winning or losing positions. Refer to the diagram to encode this. 4. **Determine the Starting Position:** - The lower-left corner of the board is the starting position of the piece. - Check the marking of this starting position in the completed chessboard diagram. If it is a marked winning square, the player who starts the game can always win with the correct strategy. 5. **Strategy for the First Player:** - Ensure the opponent always finds themselves on a losing position. - One effective strategy for the first player is to move diagonally up and to the right on their first move. - Afterward, the first player mimics the opponent's move (if the opponent moves up, the first player does the same; if the opponent moves to the right, the first player does the same). This ensures that the opponent always ends up on a losing position. 6. **Conclusion:** - Since the starting position is marked as a winning square based on our backward induction process, the first player can always enforce a strategy that forces the opponent to be on losing positions continuously. - Thus, following optimal play, the first player will always win.

This means that for each (a_i), the numbers (a_i - i, a_i - (i-1), ldots, a_i, ldots, a_i + (i-1), a_i + i) are all composite (not prime). 3. **Existence of Such (a_i):** We can find such (a_i) because there are arbitrarily large gaps between consecutive prime numbers. This is a known result in number theory. Specifically, for any positive integer (n), there exists a sequence of (n) consecutive composite numbers. This can be seen by considering the sequence ((n+1)! + 2, (n+1)! + 3, ldots, (n+1)! + (n+1)), which are all composite. 4. **Constructing (a_i):** For each (i), we can choose (a_i) such that the numbers (a_i - i, a_i - (i-1), ldots, a_i, ldots, a_i + (i-1), a_i + i) are all composite. This ensures that for any integer (k), the number (a_i + k) will be prime for only finitely many (i). 5. **Verification:** Given any integer (k), consider the sequence (a_1 + k, a_2 + k, a_3 + k, ldots). Since each (a_i) is chosen such that (a_i + j) is not prime for (|j| leq i), it follows that (a_i + k) will be composite for all (i) sufficiently large (specifically, for (i geq |k|)).

Should he start walking, or is there a risk of missing the bus?","completion":"To determine if the boy should keep walking to the next bus stop or risk missing the bus, we need to analyze the time it takes for the bus and the boy to cover certain distances. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - The boy is waiting at a bus stop. The next stop is exactly 1 km away. - The boy can see the bus from a distance of 2 km. - The boy runs 4 times slower than the bus. - If the bus comes while the boy is walking, he needs to be able to either catch the bus or return to the current stop without missing the bus. 2. **Define Variables:** Let ( v ) be the speed of the bus and ( v_b = frac{v}{4} ) be the speed of the boy. These are given conditions: - Distance between stops: ( 1 ) km - Distance the boy can see the bus: ( 2 ) km 3. **Case 1: Boy and bus moving towards each other:** If the boy sees the bus approaching from the front: - The boy and the bus move towards each other at a combined speed of ( v + v_b = v + frac{v}{4} = frac{5v}{4} ). - Let the distance between them be ( 2 ) km initially. The time until they meet is: [ t_1 = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Relative Speed}} = frac{2 text{ km}}{frac{5v}{4} text{ km/h}} = frac{2}{frac{5}{4}v} = frac{2 times 4}{5v} = frac{8}{5v} text{ hours} ] In this time, the boy can run: [ d_b = v_b times t_1 = frac{v}{4} times frac{8}{5v} = frac{8}{20} = frac{2}{5} text{ km} ] Therefore, if the boy has covered a distance ( leq frac{2}{5} ) km from the initial stop, he can still see the bus and run back to catch it. 4. **Case 2: Bus catching up to the boy from behind:** If the bus comes from behind and needs to catch up with the boy: - The relative speed at which the bus is catching up is ( v - v_b = v - frac{v}{4} = frac{3v}{4} ). - Let the initial distance between them be ( 2 ) km. The time taken for the bus to catch the boy: [ t_2 = frac{2 text{ km}}{frac{3v}{4} text{ km/h}} = frac{2}{frac{3}{4}v} = frac{2 times 4}{3v} = frac{8}{3v} text{ hours} ] In this time, the boy can run: [ d_b = v_b times t_2 = frac{v}{4} times frac{8}{3v} = frac{8}{12} = frac{2}{3} text{ km} ] Therefore, if the boy has ≤ ( frac{2}{3} ) km left to the next stop, he can reach the stop before the bus catches him. 5. **Conclusion:** Taking both scenarios into account: - In the worst case, the boy would need to ensure that either he can return the distance from the point he notices the bus (( leq frac{2}{5} text{ km} )) or reach the next stop before the bus catches up to him (( leq frac{2}{3} text{ km} )). Since ( frac{2}{3} text{ km} > frac{2}{5} text{ km} ): - Mathematically sum ( frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{5} = frac{10}{15} + frac{6}{15} approx 1.0667 text{ km}) This means the boy will always have a chance to catch the bus in either scenario.

Given a chessboard of size (8 times 8), we aim to place the maximum number of queens on black squares such that every queen can be attacked by at least one other queen. 2. Notice that the chessboard (8 times 8) has alternating black and white squares, and thus half of them, i.e., 32 squares, are black. 3. Consider the configuration of queens on the edge squares of the chessboard. A queen on the edge can only be attacked by another queen if there is at least one queen in the same row, column, or diagonal within the inner part of the board. Placing queens on just the edge does not satisfy our condition. 4. Let's restrict our attention to the inner (6 times 6) part of the chessboard, excluding the outermost border squares. This inner (6 times 6) square contains 36 squares, of which half, i.e., 18 squares, are black. 5. We split the (6 times 6) inner square into four smaller (3 times 3) squares. Each (3 times 3) square contains 5 black squares and 4 white squares. 6. Suppose we place more than 4 queens in one of these (3 times 3) sub-squares. The configuration would mean placing a queen on every black square of the sub-square, which entails that the queen in the central black square of the (3 times 3) sub-square would not be attacked by any other queen, violating our condition. 7. Thus, each (3 times 3) sub-square can have at most 4 queens to fulfill the requirement that every queen is attacked by at least one other. 8. Consequently, for the entire (6 times 6) inner square, we have four (3 times 3) sub-squares and therefore can place at most (4 times 4 = 16) queens. 9.

Firstly, let's consider the roles that A can assume: - A can be a tour guide, a ceremonial officer, or a driver. Case 1: A is a tour guide. - In this case, B has 3 options: translator, ceremonial officer, or driver. However, since B cannot be a tour guide and A is already the tour guide, B has in fact only 2 options: ceremonial officer or driver. - After B chooses one of the 2 remaining roles, C and D only have 2 left roles to choose from. - Therefore, the number of combinations for this case is: 2 possibilities for B * 2!

Case 2: A is not a tour guide. - A has 2 remaining options: ceremonial officer or driver. - Since A is not a tour guide, B still cannot be a tour guide and also cannot take the role A has taken, leaving B with 2 options as well. - After A and B have chosen their roles, C and D have 2 roles to choose from, which can be arranged in 2! ways. - The number of combinations for this case is: 2 possibilities for A * 2 possibilities for B * 2!

Adding the two cases together, we find the total number of different possible combinations: 4 + 8 = 12. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let's take another look at Case 1 to verify the calculations: Revisiting Case 1, assuming A is a tour guide: - In fact, B should have 3 options, because B cannot be a tour guide. But here, A is already assigned as the tour guide, which means B cannot choose this role by default, and there is no need to explicitly disqualify B from being a guide. Therefore, there are indeed 3 roles left for B. - After B has chosen one of the 3 roles, C and D have 2 roles left to choose from, which can be done in 2! ways. - The corrected number of combinations for this case is: 3 possibilities for B * 2! (combinations for C and D). - This leads to 3 * 2! = 3 * (2 * 1) = 6 possible combinations. Now we sum up the correct numbers for Case 1 and Case 2: 6 + 8 = 14.

Since the mixture contains 20% alcohol, the amount of alcohol in the original mixture is ( 0.20x ) litres. When 2 litres of water are added, the total volume of the new mixture becomes ( x + 2 ) litres. The amount of alcohol remains the same, ( 0.20x ) litres, because we are only adding water. According to the problem, after adding 2 litres of water, the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 17.647058823529413%. We can express this percentage as a decimal by dividing by 100, which gives us approximately 0.17647058823529413.

The tower is considered stable if every internal grid point of the (10 times 11) rectangle (excluding boundary points) is covered by the interior point of a domino. 2. **Horizontal and Vertical Pair Definitions:** There are 99 horizontal pairs of contiguous cells and 100 vertical pairs within a (10 times 11) grid. 3. **Existence of a 5-Level Stable Tower:** To show that a 5-level tower is possible, we proceed as follows: - **Levels for Vertical Pairs:** The first two levels of the tower will be arranged to cover all 100 vertical pairs. Each domino can cover one vertical pair. - **Levels for Horizontal Pairs:** We need three additional levels to adequately cover all horizontal pairs. - **Third Level:** Cover the (10 times 11) grid with horizontal dominoes. - **Fourth Level:** Exclude the rightmost and leftmost columns as well as the top row; cover the remaining (8 times 10) grid with horizontal dominoes. - **Fifth Level:** Exclude the leftmost and rightmost columns and the bottom row; use horizontal dominoes to cover all remaining horizontal pairs. 4. **Verify the 5-Level Stability:** We have covered all cells such that every contiguous internal pair of grid points has an interior point of a domino covering them. 5. **Proof that a 4-Level Stable Tower Does Not Exist:** Argue by contradiction: - Consider a simplified scenario where each internal cell has 4 neighbors (non-boundary cells). - In a 4-level tower, each neighbor must be covered by different dominos due to the stability requirement. For boundary and corner cells: - Corner cells covered by two adjacent dominos will result in one neighbor not being paired correctly. - For edge cells (excluding corners), if they are double-covered by two dominos, it leaves one neighbor wrongly paired. 6. **Conclusion:** After considering all the internal and boundary conditions, a 4-level stable tower cannot possibly cover all internal grid points as required. Hence, the minimal number of levels required for a stable tower configuration is (boxed{5})."},{"prompt":"the market, the supply of light bulbs from Factory A accounts for 70%, while those from Factory B account for 30%.

Consider a triangulation consisting of (n) triangles. 2. Remove a triangle from this triangulation that has one side lying on the boundary of the polygon. This is always possible because every triangulated polygon has at least one such triangle. 3. The remaining part of the triangulation now consists of (n-1) triangles. By our inductive hypothesis, this smaller triangulation can be colored using the three colors such that no two adjacent triangles share the same color. 4.

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume ( x leq y ) and ( z leq t ). Additionally, due to the symmetries in the equations, we can assume ( x leq z ). 2.

To understand how f(x) behaves, we find its derivative: f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{{x}^{2}}. Setting f'(x) = 0 to find critical points gives x = 1. Analyzing the sign of f'(x): - For 0 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing. - For x > 1, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing. Thus, f(x) takes its minimum value at x=1, with f(1)=1. This implies ln x > 1-frac{1}{x} for x > 0 and x neq 1. 2. **Comparing c and b:** Given c = -ln 0.9 and b = frac{1}{9}, we use the inequality ln x > 1-frac{1}{x} for x=0.9: ln 0.9 > 1 - frac{1}{0.9} = -frac{1}{9}. Multiplying by -1 gives -ln 0.9 < frac{1}{9}, so c < b. 3. **Comparing a and b:** Given a = 0.1e^{0.1}, we know -ln 0.9 = ln frac{10}{9} > frac{1}{10}, implying frac{10}{9} > e^{0.1}.

Analyzing {h'}(x): - For 0 < x < sqrt{2}-1, {h'}(x) < 0, making h(x) monotonically decreasing. - For sqrt{2}-1 < x < 1, {h'}(x) > 0, making h(x) monotonically increasing. Since h(0) = 0, for 0 < x < sqrt{2}-1, h(x) < 0. Thus, for 0 < x < sqrt{2}-1, {g'}(x) > 0, making g(x) monotonically increasing. Therefore, g(0.1) > g(0) = 0, implying 0.1e^{0.1} > -ln 0.9, so a > c.

Therefore, the relative speed between the train and the man is: Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 6 km/hr Relative speed = 66 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s.

Therefore, if x > 5 tons, the total charge y can be expressed as the sum of the charge for the first 5 tons and the charge for the excess usage.

Jake rows this 60-mile distance in 10 hours. Therefore, his rowing speed is 60 miles / 10 hours = 6 miles per hour. Now, we can find the ratio of Jake's rowing speed to his swimming speed. The rowing speed is 6 miles per hour and the swimming speed is 3 miles per hour. The ratio is 6:3, which simplifies to 2:1. So, the ratio of Jake's rowing speed to his swimming speed is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"Two cyclists started simultaneously from point A to point B.

At that moment, the second cyclist has ( 24 ) km left to cover, hence has traveled ( s - 24 ). Since they started at the same time, and time ( t_1 ) it takes to travel these distances is the same, we can set up the equation: [ frac{frac{s}{2}}{v_1} = frac{s - 24}{v_2} ] By rewriting it, we get: [ frac{s}{2 v_1} = frac{s - 24}{v_2} ] 2. **Establishing the time relation for the second condition**: When the second cyclist has traveled half of the distance, he has covered ( frac{s}{2} ). At that moment, the first cyclist has ( 15 ) km left to cover, hence has traveled ( s - 15 ). Similarly, for the second time ( t_2 ), we have: [ frac{s - 15}{v_1} = frac{frac{s}{2}}{v_2} ] By rewriting it, we get: [ frac{s - 15}{v_1} = frac{s}{2 v_2} ] 3. **Solving the system of equations**: We have two equations: [ frac{s}{2 v_1} = frac{s - 24}{v_2} ] [ frac{s - 15}{v_1} = frac{s}{2 v_2} ] From the first equation, isolate ( v_1 ): [ frac{s}{2(s - 24)}=frac{v_1}{v_2} ] From the second equation, isolate ( v_2 ): [ 2(s-15) = frac{v_2 cdot s}{v_1} ] Multiply both sides by ( v_1 ): [ 2(s-15)v_1 = s v_2 ] Now we have enough to solve for ( s ). Substitute ( frac{v_1}{v_2} ) from one equation into the other: [ frac{s}{2(s - 24)} = frac{v_1}{v_2} = frac{2(s - 15)}{s} ] Cross-multiplying, we get: [ s^2 = 4(s - 15)(s - 24) ] Distribute and combine like terms: [ s^2 = 4(s^2 - 39s + 360) ] Simplify: [ s^2 = 4s^2 - 156s + 1440 ] Bring all terms to one side: [ s^2 - 4s^2 + 156s - 1440 = 0 ] Simplify further: [ -3s^2 + 156s - 1440 = 0 ] Divide by -3: [ s^2 - 52s + 480 = 0 ] Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( s = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ): [ s = frac{52 pm sqrt{52^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 480}}{2 cdot 1} ] [ s = frac{52 pm sqrt{2704 - 1920}}{2} ] [ s = frac{52 pm sqrt{784}}{2} ] [ s = frac{52 pm 28}{2} ] Thus: [ s_1 = frac{80}{2} = 40 ] [ s_2 = frac{24}{2} = 12 ] Since ( s ) must be greater than both 15 and 24 km to match the problem constraints, we discard ( s_2 = 12 ) and are left with: [ s = 40 ] 4. **Conclusion**: The distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) is ( boxed{40 text{ km}} )."},{"prompt":"Kim sold 54 boxes of Girl Scout cookies.

Each of the 5 balls has 3 choices of boxes to be placed into, giving us 3^5 ways. Next, because the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 boxes. However, we also need to account for the fact that not all distributions will have boxes in distinguishable configurations (e.g., some boxes could be empty, reducing the effective number of boxes in use). The total number of ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes can be calculated using the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the ways to partition a set of objects into non-empty subsets. Specifically, we need S(5,1) + S(5,2) + S(5,3), where S(n,k) is the number of ways to partition n objects into k non-empty subsets. We find: - S(5,1) = 1 (all balls in one box), - S(5,2) = 15 (balls split between two boxes), - S(5,3) = 25 (balls split among three boxes).

We're looking for a series of consecutive natural numbers starting from 1, where the sum of these numbers, excluding Yaya's house number, is exactly 10,000. 2.

Since the powers of i cycle every four powers (i^4 = 1), we can simplify i^{2016} as follows: i^{2016} = (i^4)^{504} = 1^{504} = 1. Now, we can substitute 1 for i^{2016} in the expression for z to get: z = frac {1}{3+2i}.

Setting f'(x) = 0 gives us the equation 1 + ln x - 2ax = 0. This equation must have two distinct roots in (0, +infty) for f(x) to have two distinct extreme points. This is equivalent to finding two distinct intersections of the graphs of g(x) = ln x and y = 2ax - 1 in (0, +infty). Let's find the slope of g(x) to match it with the slope of y = 2ax - 1. We have g'(x) = frac{1}{x}. Setting this equal to 2a gives us x_0 = frac{1}{2a} as the point where the slope of g(x) matches 2a. The tangent line to g(x) at x_0 = frac{1}{2a} is given by y - ln(frac{1}{2a}) = frac{1}{2a}(x - frac{1}{2a}).

To prove x_{1} cdot x_{2} > 1, it suffices to show ln x_{1} + ln x_{2} > 0, which is equivalent to (2ax_{1} - 1) + (2ax_{2} - 1) > 0, or 2a(x_{1} + x_{2}) > 2. This is equivalent to showing frac{ln x_1 - ln x_2}{x_1 - x_2} > frac{2}{x_1 + x_2}. Since 0 < x_{1} < x_{2}, we consider t = frac{x_1}{x_2} in (0, 1) and analyze the function h(t) = ln t - frac{2(t - 1)}{t + 1}. The derivative h'(t) = frac{1}{t} - frac{4}{(t + 1)^2} = frac{(t - 1)^2}{t(t + 1)^2} > 0 for t in (0, 1), indicating h(t) is monotonically increasing in this interval.

To show this, consider the power of point O with respect to the concentric circles: [ OE cdot OF = r^2. ] Due to the symmetric property, every perpendicular bisector generated from any point on a line through the center intersects at O, confirming that M lies on line AB. 6. **Finding the Ratio ( frac{AM}{MC} )** Given the symmetry and properties of distances in a circle, we know that: ( AM = MB = MC ) Since D is the midpoint of [AB], we consider M as the midpoint of [DC] as M lies on all perpendicular bisectors generated from the similar nature of intersections. Thus, the ratio is: [ frac{AM}{MC} = 1 ] # Conclusion: ( boxed{1} )"},{"prompt":"a diagram, AB and CD are diameters of a circle with radius 6, intersecting perpendicularly at the center O.

Find: a) The side length of the square (with vertex C) that has the largest area entirely within triangle ABC. b) The dimensions of the rectangle (with vertex C) that has the largest area entirely within triangle ABC. Let's solve each part step-by-step. Part (a): 1. **Determine the Side Length of the Square**: * We'll start by noting that the square with maximum area within triangle ABC with vertex C will have equal side lengths s such that the vertices of the square lie along AC and BC. 2. **Use Similar Triangles**: * Consider the largest such square inside the triangle with sides parallel to the legs AC and BC. Notice that, by similarity of triangles, the smaller triangles outside the square and the overall triangle related proportionally. 3. **Set up the Proportional Relations**: * These relations show that s = frac{ab}{a+b} - derived from the algebraic manipulation, usually by considering similar triangles in {triangle ABC}.

According to the problem, the loser would then win by a margin of 20% of the votes polled.

To find the maximum number of participants who have won at least three matches, we need to consider how many participants can accumulate such a record without exhausting the number of matches available. 4. Each participant needs to win at least 3 matches.

A rectangle in the complex plane is defined by its sides being parallel to the axes or by having consecutive sides orthogonal to each other. 1. **Orthogonality Condition:** Assuming z and z^4 are diagonally opposite vertices (since they are likely the farthest apart), the vectors representing the sides of the rectangle are (z^2 + z) - z = z^2 and (z^3 + z^2) - (z^2 + z) = z^3. For these to form a rectangle, they need to be orthogonal: [ z^2 cdot z^3 = |z|^5 cdot e^{itheta} cdot e^{i3theta} = |z|^5 cdot e^{i4theta} = 0 ] which implies e^{i4theta} = pm i, so theta = frac{pi}{8}, frac{3pi}{8}, frac{5pi}{8}, frac{7pi}{8}. 2. **Area Calculation:** The area of the rectangle can be computed as the product of the magnitudes of these side vectors: [ text{Area} = |z^2| cdot |z^3| = |z|^2 cdot |z|^3 = |z|^5 ] Substituting |z| = 1 for simplicity (as higher powers will scale the area without adding complexity), the area becomes: [ text{Area} = 1^5 = 1 ] This is under the simplifying assumption that |z| = 1. If |z| varies, the area will be |z|^5, and any positive real number could theoretically be the area. **Conclusion**: The possible areas of the rectangle formed by the vertices z, z^2 + z, z^3 + z^2, and z^4 are areas of the form |z|^5 for |z| > 0. The simplest case (with |z| = 1) gives an area of boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"Let the set M = {x | 2^{x+1} > 1}, and the set N = {x | ln(x) leq 1}.

The nth term of a geometric progression can be found using the formula: [ a_n = a cdot r^{(n-1)} ] Given that the last term (a_n) is 1/3, we can set up the equation: [ 1/3 = 9 cdot r^{(n-1)} ] [ r^{(n-1)} = frac{1/3}{9} ] [ r^{(n-1)} = frac{1}{27} ] Since 1/27 is 3^-3, we can deduce that: [ r^{(n-1)} = 3^{-3} ] Now, we need to find the value of r. Since 3^-3 is the (n-1)th power of r, it implies that r could be 1/3, because (1/3)^(n-1) = 1/27 when n-1 = 3, which means n = 4.

Assuming l is tangent to the curve y=e^{x}, let the tangent point be (x_{0},y_{0}), we have e^{x_{0}}=1-frac{1}{a}=(1-frac{1}{a})x_{0}-1, eliminating a gives e^{x_{0}}=e^{x_{0}}x_{0}-1, let h(x)=e^{x}x-e^{x}-1, then h'(x)=e^{x}x, setting h'(x) > 0, then x > 0, thus h(x) is monotonically decreasing over (-infty,0) and monotonically increasing over (0,+infty), when xrightarrow-infty, h(x)rightarrow-1, xrightarrow+infty, h(x)rightarrow+infty, so h(x) has a unique solution over (0,+infty), then e^{x_{0}} > 1, but when a > 0, 1-frac{1}{a} < 1, which contradicts e^{x_{0}} > 1, so such a situation does not exist. Therefore, the answer is: boxed{text{D}}. By finding the derivative of f(x), according to the problem, f'(x) < 0 has solutions over (-infty,+infty). Discussing a < 0 and a > 0 leads to the conclusion that a > 0 is valid. After finding the equation of the tangent line l, assuming l is tangent to the curve y=e^{x} and setting the tangent point as (x_{0},y_{0}), we get e^{x_{0}}=1-frac{1}{a}=(1-frac{1}{a})x_{0}-1. Eliminating a gives e^{x_{0}}x_{0}-e^{x_{0}}-1=0. By defining h(x)=e^{x}x-e^{x}-1, finding its derivative and monotonic intervals, we conclude that h(x) has a unique solution over (0,+infty). Given a > 0, we can determine that such a situation does not exist. This problem examines the application of derivatives: finding the equation of a tangent line and monotonic intervals, the application of linear equations, the construction method of functions, and the use of transformation ideas in function equations, making it a medium-level question."},{"prompt":"Let ( S_7 ) denote all the permutations of (1, 2, ldots, 7).

When each carriage seats 2 people, there are 9 people who cannot find a seat, which means the total number of people is 9 more than twice the number of carriages (since each carriage can seat 2 people). Given these conditions, we can set up an equation to represent the scenario. The number of carriages is represented by x. For the first condition, the total number of people that can be seated when each carriage seats 3 people, with two carriages empty, is 3(x-2). This is because there are x carriages, but 2 are not being used, so we subtract 2 from x and then multiply by 3 (since each of the remaining carriages can seat 3 people). For the second condition, the total number of people is represented by 2x + 9. This is because each of the x carriages can seat 2 people, and there are 9 additional people who cannot find a seat in any carriage.

The derivative of a function at a specific point is equal to the slope of the curve at that point. Setting up the tangent line equation and utilizing the properties of two tangent lines are crucial for solving this problem. First, find the derivative of y = x + ln x. This gives us the slope of the tangent line, which allows us to find its equation. Then, since this tangent line is also tangent to the curve y = ax^2 + (a + 2)x + 1, it will have exactly one point of intersection. By combining the equations of the tangent line and the curve, and using the discriminant Delta = 0, we can find the value of a. The derivative of y = x + ln x is y' = 1 + frac{1}{x}. The slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x + ln x at x = 1 is k = 2. Thus, the equation of the tangent line at x = 1 is y - 1 = 2(x - 1), which simplifies to y = 2x - 1.

This makes the equation incorrect. - **Equation ②** says {0}supseteq varnothing. Since every set, including a set containing the number 0, automatically includes the empty set as a subset, this statement is correct.

The foci of the hyperbola, denoted as F_1 and F_2, are positioned such that the line x=2a intersects the hyperbola at points A and B. 1. **Finding Points A and B**: - The equation of the line is x=2a. Substituting this into the equation of the hyperbola gives frac{(2a)^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, which simplifies to 4 - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. Solving for y yields y = pm sqrt{3}b. Therefore, the coordinates of A and B are (2a, pm sqrt{3}b). 2. **Finding the Centroid of triangle ABD**: - The centroid of a triangle is found by averaging the x and y coordinates of its vertices. For triangle ABD, the vertices are (2a, sqrt{3}b), (2a, -sqrt{3}b), and (0, b) or (0, -b). Averaging the x-coordinates gives frac{2a + 2a + 0}{3} = frac{4a}{3}, and averaging the y-coordinates gives frac{sqrt{3}b - sqrt{3}b + b}{3} = pm frac{b}{3}.

For a hyperbola, c^2 = a^2 + b^2. 4. **Finding the Relationship between a and b**: - Since the centroid lies on the circle, substituting its coordinates into the circle's equation yields left(frac{4a}{3}right)^2 + left(pm frac{b}{3}right)^2 = a^2 + b^2. Simplifying gives frac{16}{9}a^2 + frac{1}{9}b^2 = a^2 + b^2.

Substituting frac{b}{a} = frac{sqrt{14}}{4} into this equation gives the asymptotes as y = pm frac{sqrt{14}}{4}x.

Since x is the maximum root, it means there should be no roots greater than x. 3. The function f(x) changes from positive to negative or vice versa as it crosses a root. If f'(x) < 0, it would imply that the slope of the function is negative at x, leading to a decrease in f(x) as we move to the right of x.

We claim that after any number of operations, the numbers on the board will retain properties where one number is (6) more than the second and (6) less than the third. We will prove this invariant by induction. 4. **Base Case**: Initially, the numbers are (3), (9), and (15). Here (9 = 3 + 6) and (15 = 9 + 6), so the invariant holds. 5. **Inductive Step**: Assume at some stage the numbers on the board are (x - 6, x), and (x + 6). 6. Consider the operation of adding two numbers and subtracting the third: - If we add (x - 6) and (x + 6) and subtract (x), the result is: [ (x - 6) + (x + 6) - x = 2x - x = x quad Rightarrow quad {(x - 6), (x + 6), x}thinspace text{remains the same.} ] - If we add (x - 6) and (x) and subtract (x + 6), the result is: [ (x - 6) + x - (x + 6) = x - 6 quad Rightarrow quad {(x - 6), x, (x - 12)} ] Notice here how the sequence ((x - 18), (x - 12), (x - 6)) maintains the invariant. - If we add (x) and (x + 6) and subtract (x - 6), the result is: [ x + (x + 6) - (x - 6) = x + 12 quad Rightarrow quad {(x + 12), x, (x + 6)} ] This sequence ((x + 0), (x + 6), (x + 12)) keeps the invariant as well. 7.

Therefore: [ angle AEM = 90^circ quad text{and} quad angle AFM = 90^circ ] 2. Notice that: [ angle AEM = 90^circ = 180^circ - angle AFM ] This implies that points (A), (E), (M), and (F) lie on a common circle (they are concyclic). 3.

First, let's prove that the 5 edges of the pentagon (upper circle) are of the same color: 4. Suppose the edges A_1A_2, A_2A_3, A_3A_4, A_4A_5, A_5A_1 are not all the same color.

Examine the edges from A_1 to B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5 which give us 5 more edges. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least three edges of the same color among them. 6. Without loss of generality, assume A_1 B_i, A_1 B_j, A_1 B_k (where i, j, k are distinct) are red. Since there cannot be a monochromatic red triangle, and we already have A_1A_2 as red: 7.

Mary must put back some oranges so that the average price of the pieces of fruit that she keeps is 50¢. How many oranges must Mary put back?","completion":"Let's denote the number of apples Mary selects as A and the number of oranges as O. We know that A + O = 10 because she selects a total of 10 pieces of fruit. The total cost of the apples is 40A cents, and the total cost of the oranges is 60O cents. The average price of the 10 pieces of fruit is 54 cents, so the total cost of the 10 pieces of fruit is 54 * 10 = 540 cents. We can write the equation for the total cost as: 40A + 60O = 540 We also know that A + O = 10, so we can express A in terms of O: A = 10 - O Now we can substitute A in the total cost equation: 40(10 - O) + 60O = 540 400 - 40O + 60O = 540 20O = 540 - 400 20O = 140 O = 140 / 20 O = 7 So, Mary initially selects 7 oranges.

The rules of the game are as follows: participants first do a 50meter return run. From the second time onwards, participants need to roll two fair dice to determine the number of return runs. If the sum of the points obtained from the two dice is divisible by 3, the participant only needs to do one return run.

Explain your reasoning.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding (P_1), (P_2), (P_3) - **For (P_1):** Since the first 50-meter return run is mandatory for all participants, the probability (P_1 = 1). - **For (P_2):** Before the second return run, participants roll two fair dice. The probability that the sum of the dice is divisible by 3 is calculated as follows: [ P = frac{{C}_{6}^{1}C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{1}{C}_{6}^{1}} = frac{1}{3} ] Therefore, (P_2 = frac{1}{3}) because this is the probability that only one return run is needed in the second round. - **For (P_3):** To find (P_3), consider two scenarios: 1. The participant does two return runs in the second round, which has a probability of (frac{2}{3}). 2. The participant does one return run in both the second and third rounds, each with a probability of (frac{1}{3}), leading to a combined probability of (frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{9}). Combining these probabilities gives: [ P_3 = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{9} = frac{7}{9} ] Part 2: Proving {(P_n - P_{n-1})} Forms a Geometric Sequence - For (n geq 3), there are two situations for a participant to complete (n) return runs: 1. Completing the ((n-1))th return run with a probability of (P_{n-1}) and then doing one more run with a probability of (frac{1}{3}). 2. Completing the ((n-2))th return run with a probability of (P_{n-2}) and then doing two more runs with a probability of (frac{2}{3}). This leads to the formula: [ P_n = frac{1}{3}P_{n-1} + frac{2}{3}P_{n-2} ] Rearranging gives: [ P_n - P_{n-1} = -frac{2}{3}(P_{n-1} - P_{n-2}) ] Since (P_2 - P_1 = -frac{2}{3}), it follows that {(P_n - P_{n-1})} forms a geometric sequence with the first term (-frac{2}{3}) and common ratio (q = -frac{2}{3}). Part 3: Finding (P_n) and Predicting the Number of Return Runs - From the previous parts, we have: [ P_n - P_{n-1} = (-frac{2}{3})^{n-1} ] Summing up these differences from (n=1) to (n), we get: [ P_n = 1 + (-frac{2}{3}) + (-frac{2}{3})^2 + ldots + (-frac{2}{3})^{n-1} = frac{3}{5}[1-(-frac{2}{3})^n] ] This formula is valid for (n in mathbb{N}^*). - **Predicting the Number of Return Runs:** - When (n) is odd, (-frac{2}{3} leq (-frac{2}{3})^n < 0), so (frac{3}{5} < P_n leq 1). - When (n) is even, (0 < (-frac{2}{3})^n leq frac{4}{9}), so (frac{1}{3} leq P_n < frac{3}{5}).

This can be derived from the properties of equilateral triangles, where these points coincide. 2. We need to examine the perpendicular bisectors of segments OB and OC. Let these bisectors intersect side BC at points D and E respectively. 3. Since FD and GE are perpendicular bisectors, triangles BOD and COE are isosceles triangles. Therefore, the angles angle BOD and angle COE are equal. 4. For an equilateral triangle ABC, each internal angle is 60^circ. Since O is the centroid, angle BOC is exactly 120^circ because the centroid divides each internal angle into two equal parts. 5. Considering the angles at D, OE and OD, [ angle BOE = angle BOC - angle COE = 120^circ - 30^circ = 90^circ. ] Thus, angle BOE is a right angle. 6. Since angle BOD and angle COE are each 30^circ, and given that O is the midpoint and angle BOC = 120^circ, we can infer that OD and OE are each equal to half of side BC due to symmetry in length: [ OD = OE. ] 7. Since O is also the centroid, these perpendicular bisectors cut the BC side into equal segments. Consequently, both BD and DE are each equal to BC/3. 8.

Label the midpoint of AB as F and the foot of the altitude from A to AC as T. Since the altitude drops perpendicularly, angle ATB = 90^circ. As alpha is given as the angle at vertex A, point T lies on the internal part of segment AC. 3. Triangle ATB formed is right-angled at T. Due to the right-angle property, point T lies on the Thales circle of diameter AB. This gives the following segment equalities considering the radius r of the Thales circle: [ AF = FB = FT = r ] 4. Triangle ATF is an isosceles triangle (as AF = FT). Therefore, the angles angle FAT and angle ATF are equal: [ angle FAT = angle ATF = alpha ] Given this information, we can construct this isosceles triangle ATF. 5. To determine point B, we reflect point A over point F. This reflection because F is the midpoint ensures that B is symmetric to A with respect to F. Therefore: [ B = A' ] 6.

Now, let's calculate the expected number of hammers for October: Claw hammers in October: 9 (September) + 4 (increase) = 13 Ball-peen hammers in October: 11 (September) + 4 (increase) = 15 Total hammers without the seasonal increase: 13 (claw hammers) + 15 (ball-peen hammers) = 28 Now, we need to account for the 5% seasonal increase in the combined orders: Seasonal increase: 28 hammers * 0.05 = 1.4 hammers Since we can't order a fraction of a hammer, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 hammers. Total hammers with the seasonal increase: 28 (original total) + 2 (seasonal increase) = 30 hammers Therefore, Springtown Hardware will order a total of boxed{30} hammers in October."},{"prompt":"Let ( ABC ) be a triangle with ( AB < AC ).

To convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hr): Relative speed (m/s) = 33 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) Relative speed (m/s) = 33 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed (m/s) = 33000 / 3600 Relative speed (m/s) = 9.16666667 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to pass the man to find the length of the train: Length of train = Relative speed * Time Length of train = 9.16666667 m/s * 11.999040076793857 s Length of train ≈ 110 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{110} meters."},{"prompt":"Given that the incircle of an equilateral triangle touches the midpoints of its three sides, we can analogously conjecture that the insphere of a regular tetrahedron touches the four faces at ( ) A: A point inside each equilateral triangle B: A point on a certain altitude of each equilateral triangle C: The centroid of each equilateral triangle D: A point outside each equilateral triangle","completion":"**Analysis of the Problem:** The faces of a tetrahedron can be analogized to the sides of a triangle.

When summed across all weights on both pans, since we are mirroring counts: If weights ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100} ) are on the left and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{100} ) are on the right, and given: [ text{# for } a_i = text{count of all lighter weights on right side} ] - Total count across both is equalizing for all cases. 7. **Proving Equality**: - For left pan, sum of all lighter counts from opposite: [ sum (text{count for } text{left weights}) = sum (text{count for right weights}) ] - Across 100-100 split, symmetry upholds the sum equality. 8. **Conclusion**: [ sum_{text{left pan}} text{counts} = sum_{text{right pan}} text{counts} ] Thus, we have shown that the sum of the numbers written on the weights on the left pan is equal to the sum of the numbers written on the weights on the right pan.

Each external point has a well-defined winding number around ( C ). - Color regions based on even and odd winding numbers. - A line ( L ) from infinity to infinity crosses ( C ) an even number of times by parity argument. - Given ( C )'s odd number of edges, ( L ) must miss some edges, contradicting the assumption. 8. **Proof: Rotation Argument (Solution 4)** - Take ( R ), a point on ( L ) outside the convex hull of points. - ( L_0 ) can be a line through ( R ) intersecting no segments initially. - As ( L_0 ) rotates around ( R ), each time it passes a point ( P ), the intersection count changes by an even number (0 or 2). - Maintains the even parity ensuring an even total number of intersections, contradiction given odd segments. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The line } L text{ does not exist.}} ]"},{"prompt":"f a is a root of the equation x^{2}+2x1=0, then the value of 2a^{2}+4a2024 is A: 2023 B: 2023 C: 2022 D: 2022","completion":"Given that a is a root of the equation x^{2}+2x-1=0, we can start by expressing this relationship as: 1. a^{2} + 2a - 1 = 0 From this equation, we aim to find the value of 2a^{2} + 4a - 2024.

Let ( k ) represent the number of ways to choose five numbers from the first 90 numbers where no two numbers are consecutive. 3. The total number of possible ways to choose five numbers out of 90 is given by ( binom{90}{5} ). Thus, the probability ( p ) can be expressed as: [ p = 1 - frac{k}{binom{90}{5}} ] 4. To find ( k ), consider a valid selection of numbers ( 1 leq a < b < c < d < e leq 90 ) such that no two numbers are consecutive. 5. Transform each pair of consecutive indices into non-consecutive by using the transformation: [ a, quad b-1, quad c-2, quad d-3, quad e-4 ] This transformation ensures all values are distinct and lie between 1 and 86 (inclusive). 6. Conversely, for any valid selection ( 1 leq a' < b' < c' < d' < e' leq 86 ), the transformation: [ a, quad b'+1, quad c'+2, quad d'+3, quad e'+4 ] results in values within the range of 1 to 90, maintaining non-consecutiveness. 7. Hence, the number ( k ) is given by the number of ways to choose five numbers out of 86: [ k = binom{86}{5} ] 8. The probability ( p ) then is: [ p = 1 - frac{binom{86}{5}}{binom{90}{5}} ] 9.

Any number ( m ) will first appear in the sequence ( I_{m-1} ). - If ( m > n ), then ( m ) no longer appears in sequences of greater indices. 4. **Number 1973**: - The number 1973 will first appear in ( I_{1972} ). - For sequences ( I_n ) where ( n geq 1973 ), the sequence will preserve 1973 exactly the same way. 5. **Euler’s Totient Function ((varphi))**: - We use Euler's Totient Function, ( varphi ). For a prime number ( p ), ( varphi(p) = p-1 ). - Since 1973 is a prime, ( varphi(1973) = 1972 ). 6. **Final Answer**: - By the structure of the sequence, and utilizing Euler's Totient Function, we conclude: - Number 1973 appears in all ( I_n ) for ( n geq 1973 ) exactly 1972 times, corresponding to the pairs ( (1, 1972), (2, 1971), ldots, (1972, 1) ).

The sum of the seven 1s is 7, so the large number would be 39 - 7 = 32. The difference between 39 and the sum of the other elements (which are all 1s) is 32 - 7 = 25. So, M = 25.

This can be interpreted as a being at least as large as a certain function of x, specifically a geq x - frac{3}{x}. 2. **Finding the Minimum Value of a**: To find the range of a, we need to determine the minimum value of a that satisfies the inequality for all x in the given interval. This is equivalent to finding the maximum value of the function y = x - frac{3}{x} over the interval [1,3]. 3. **Analyzing the Function y = x - frac{3}{x}**: - The function y = x is monotonically increasing in [1,3] because as x increases, y increases. - Similarly, the function y = -frac{3}{x} is monotonically increasing in [1,3] because as x increases, the magnitude of -frac{3}{x} decreases, making y less negative (and thus increasing). - Combining these observations, the function y = x - frac{3}{x} is also monotonically increasing in [1,3]. This means that as x increases within this interval, the value of y increases. 4. **Finding the Maximum Value of y in [1,3]**: Since y = x - frac{3}{x} is monotonically increasing in the interval [1,3], its maximum value occurs at the upper bound of this interval, which is x = 3. Substituting x = 3 into the function gives y = 3 - frac{3}{3} = 2. 5. **Determining the Range of a**: Since the minimum value of a that satisfies the inequality for all x in [1,3] corresponds to the maximum value of y = x - frac{3}{x}, and we found this maximum value to be 2, it follows that a geq 2.

The slope of the given tangent line 7x-4y-12=0 is dfrac{7}{4}. We'll use this information: Since f(x) = ax-dfrac{b}{x}, the derivative f'(x) = a+dfrac{b}{x^2}. Therefore, f'(2) = a+dfrac{b}{4}= dfrac{7}{4}. To find the actual values of a and b, we need a second equation. We use the point-slope form of the tangent line at (2, f(2)), substituting for y and solving for f(2): 7cdot2 - 4f(2) - 12 = 0 implies 4f(2) = 2 implies f(2) = dfrac{1}{2}. Now we have f(2) = acdot2 - dfrac{b}{2} = dfrac{1}{2}. With the system of equations: [ begin{align*} a+dfrac{b}{4} &= dfrac{7}{4} 2a - dfrac{b}{2} &= dfrac{1}{2} end{align*} ] Multiplying the second equation by 2 to eliminate b, we get: [ begin{align*} a+dfrac{b}{4} &= dfrac{7}{4} 4a - b &= 1 end{align*} ] Solving this linear system gives us a = 1 and b = 3. Therefore, the explicit formula for f(x) is boxed{f(x) = x - dfrac{3}{x}}. (2) Let's prove the constancy of the area. Suppose P(x_0,y_0) is any point on the curve y=f(x). With the derivative {y'} = 1+dfrac{3}{x^2}, we have the equation of the tangent line at point P(x_0, y_0) as: y-y_0 = (1+dfrac{3}{x_0^2})(x-x_0). Rewrite y_0 as f(x_0) = x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}. Now, setting x=0, we find the y-coordinate of the intersection with the y-axis (line x=0): y = -dfrac{3}{x_0} - dfrac{3}{x_0} = -dfrac{6}{x_0}, giving the point (0,-dfrac{6}{x_0}). Setting y=x for the intersection with the line y=x, we solve the equation: x = x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0} + x - x_0 implies x = 2x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}. Since y=x, we have y= 2x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}, which simplifies to (x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}) + x_0 = 2x_0, thus confirming the intersection point (2x_0, 2x_0). The area of the triangle formed by these points and the origin can now be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = dfrac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, the base is the x-coordinate of the intersection with y=x, which is 2x_0, and the height is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the intersection with the y-axis, which is left| -dfrac{6}{x_0} right|. Therefore, the area is: Area = dfrac{1}{2} times 2x_0 times left| -dfrac{6}{x_0} right| = boxed{6} (because the x_0 terms cancel out).

We need to prove that the distance between ( O ) and ( O_1 ) is equal to the sum of the semi-axes of the ellipse. 2. Let ( varphi ) be the angle between one of the tangents and the ( x )-axis. 3. Consider the circle ( S ) centered at (left((a+b) cos varphi, (a+b) sin varphi right)), which passes through the point ( A = left( a cos varphi, b sin varphi right) ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, respectively. 4. The equation of the tangent to the ellipse at point ( A ) is: [ frac{a cos varphi}{a^2} x + frac{b sin varphi}{b^2} y = 1 ] 5.

This line is perpendicular to the line passing through ( A ) and ( O_1 ), whose equation is: [ y = frac{a sin varphi}{b cos varphi} x + c ] simplifying we get the slope ( m = frac{a sin varphi}{b cos varphi} ). 7. The tangents ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) must touch the ellipse at some points, say ( A ) and ( B ).

Let the tangent ( l_1 ) touch the ellipse at the point ( (-a cos alpha, b sin alpha) ). Then its equation is: [ frac{-x cos alpha}{a} + frac{y sin alpha}{b} = 1 ] 9. Thus, we have: [ tan varphi = frac{b cos alpha}{a sin alpha} ] 10. The square of the distance from the origin to the line ( l_1 ) is: [ d^2 = frac{b^2}{sin^2 alpha} cdot frac{1}{1 + tan^2 varphi} = b^2 frac{cos^2 varphi}{sin^2 alpha} ] 11.

Since the speeds are given in kmph, we need to convert them to meters per second (m/s) to be consistent with the other units. 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds = 5/18 m/s The speed of the first train in m/s is: 42 kmph * (5/18) = 210/18 = 11.6667 m/s The speed of the second train in m/s is: 30 kmph * (5/18) = 150/18 = 8.3333 m/s The relative speed of the two trains is: 11.6667 m/s + 8.3333 m/s = 20 m/s The time taken for the trains to clear each other is given as 15.99872010239181 seconds. The distance covered by the two trains in this time is the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the second train as L meters.

Therefore, the equation of curve C is derived from the standard form of an ellipse equation frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, resulting in boxed{frac{x^{2}}{3}+y^{2}=1}. Part (2) Let the center of the circle be P(x_{0},y_{0}). The equation for curve C and the condition for P gives us x_{0}^{2}+3y_{0}^{2}=3. The circle centered at P with radius frac{sqrt{3}}{2} is described by (x-x_{0})^{2}+(y-y_{0})^{2}=frac{3}{4}. When x_{0}^{2}=frac{3}{4}, P is at (±frac{sqrt{3}}{2},±frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), making the circle tangent to both coordinate axes at the origin O. In this scenario, OA and OB represent the major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively, leading to |OA|^{2}+|OB|^{2}=3+1=4. For x_{0}^{2}≠frac{3}{4}, consider the tangent line from O to circle P with equation y=kx. The equations of lines OA and OB are y=k_{1}x and y=k_{2}x respectively. Solving the tangent condition gives us (4x_{0}^{2}-3)k^{2}-8x_{0}y_{0}k+4y_{0}^{2}-3=0. The roots k_{1} and k_{2} of this equation satisfy k_{1}k_{2}=frac{4y_{0}^{2}-3}{4x_{0}^{2}-3}=-frac{1}{3}. Using the system left{begin{array}{l}{y=kx}{x^{2}+3y^{2}=3}end{array}right., we find x^{2}=frac{3}{1+3k^{2} }. For points A(x_{A},y_{A}) and B(x_{B},y_{B}), we have x_{A}^{2}=frac{3}{1+3k_{1}^{2}} and x_{B}^{2}=frac{3}{1+3k_{2}^{2}}. Calculating |OA|^{2}+|OB|^{2} yields frac{3(1+k_{1}^{2})}{1+3k_{1}^{2}}+frac{3(1+k_{2}^{2})}{1+3k_{2}^{2}}=2+frac{2[2+3(k_{1}^{2}+k_{2}^{2})]}{9k_{1}^{2}k_{2}^{2}+3(k_{1}^{2}+k_{2}^{2})+1}=4. Thus, regardless of the position of P on curve C, |OA|^{2}+|OB|^{2} remains a constant value of boxed{4}."},{"prompt":"eaven and her younger brother want to buy school supplies, so they ask their father for money, who gives them 100 in total to use.

There are 50 even numbers in this range. 2. Next, we consider the condition that kx is not divisible by 100 for all k = 1, 2, ldots, 49.

The angle swept by the center O' of the smaller circle with respect to the center O of the larger circle is theta . - In addition, because the circumference of the smaller circle is half of that of the larger circle, the point A' on the smaller circle will rotate through an additional angle of theta relative to O', making the total angle 2theta for A' relative to O. 4. **Locating A' After Rotation**: - The point A' initially at A will rotate about the center O' while O' moves around O. This means after an angle theta , A' would have additionally rotated by theta . - The total angle that A' makes with O is therefore 2theta. 5. **Path Traced by A'**: - As a result, the point A' will trace a path that doubles the angle swept by the radius vector connecting O to A. - This path traced by A' is known as an **ellipse** due to the symmetric and constraining nature of the two circles involved. # Conclusion: The path traced out by a point on the circumference of the smaller circle as it rolls inside the larger circle is a specific kind of curve named the **hypotrochoid**.

Firstly, we will prove the formula for the area of a triangle, and then we will apply this formula to find the required area. Step 1: Proving the Area Formula We need to prove that the area ( S ) of a triangle can be given by: [ S = 2R^2 sin alpha sin beta sin gamma ] where ( R ) is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and ( alpha ), ( beta ), and ( gamma ) are the angles opposite to the sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) respectively. - According to the Law of Sines, for any triangle with sides ( a, b, ) and ( c ), and corresponding opposite angles ( alpha, beta, ) and ( gamma ): [ a = 2R sin alpha, quad b = 2R sin beta, quad c = 2R sin gamma ] - The area ( S ) of the triangle can be expressed using the formula involving sine of an angle: [ S = frac{1}{2} ab sin gamma ] - Substituting ( a ) and ( b ) from the Law of Sines: [ S = frac{1}{2} (2R sin alpha) (2R sin beta) sin gamma ] - Simplifying the expression: [ S = frac{1}{2} cdot 4R^2 sin alpha sin beta sin gamma ] [ S = 2R^2 sin alpha sin beta sin gamma ] This proves our desired formula for the area of the triangle.

Show that there is a scheme of buying 9 tickets guaranteeing at least one winning ticket, but 8 tickets are not enough to guarantee a winning ticket in general.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to show two things: 1. There is a scheme of buying 9 tickets that guarantees at least one winning ticket. 2. Buying 8 tickets is not enough to guarantee a winning ticket in general. # Part 1: Proving that 9 tickets are sufficient We need to cover all possible sets of 6 numbers chosen from 36 numbers with 9 tickets. One way to approach this is to use combinatorial design, specifically a covering design. A covering design is a collection of subsets (blocks) such that every possible subset of a certain size is contained in at least one block. In this case, we need a covering design where each block is a set of 6 numbers, and every possible set of 6 numbers from 36 is covered by at least one of the 9 blocks. To construct such a design, consider the following 9 tickets: 1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} 2. {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12} 3. {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18} 4. {19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24} 5. {25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30} 6. {31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36} 7. {1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31} 8. {2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32} 9. {3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33} Each of these tickets covers a unique set of 6 numbers. To show that this guarantees a winning ticket, consider any set of 6 numbers drawn by the lottery committee. At least one of these 9 tickets will not contain any of the 6 drawn numbers, ensuring a winning ticket. # Part 2: Proving that 8 tickets are not sufficient To prove that 8 tickets are not enough, we use the pigeonhole principle. Suppose we have 8 tickets, each containing 6 numbers. The total number of numbers covered by these 8 tickets is at most (8 times 6 = 48). Since there are only 36 numbers available, some numbers must be repeated across the tickets. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must appear in at least two tickets. Let's denote this number by (alpha). If (alpha) appears in two tickets, then we need to cover the remaining 5 numbers in each of the 6 sets drawn by the lottery committee. However, since we only have 8 tickets, it is possible to construct a set of 6 numbers such that no ticket avoids all 6 numbers. This means that there is no guarantee of a winning ticket with only 8 tickets. Therefore, 8 tickets are not sufficient to guarantee a winning ticket.

Then it wouldn't be able to cover both directions of all 10 vertical and 10 horizontal streets, leaving some intersections unvisited. 8. **Conclusion**: - The analysis confirms that covering every intersection at least once in a closed route requires at least 20 turns due to the need to change direction between each street pair. Hence, the minimum number of turns a bus must make to visit all intersections in a closed route is: [ boxed{20} ]"},{"prompt":"After the day, they were able to make 6 institutions happy.

The ticket prices for these trains are unique and the prices are the same in both directions. 2. **Remove all trains initially**: - Remove all express trains and later reintroduce them one by one in order of increasing ticket prices. Meaning, the cheapest train will be reintroduced first, then the second cheapest, and so on. 3. **Track city costs**: - Keep track of the maximum number of express trains one can use consecutively starting from any city such that travel costs decrease monotonically. Initially, set the cost for all cities to zero since no trains are available. 4. **Introducing trains**: - When a new train connecting cities ( A ) and ( B ) with ticket prices less than the previous ones is introduced, update the costs in cities ( A ) and ( B ). - The cost in city ( A ) should be at least ( b + 1 ) if previously the cost to run trains from city ( B ) was ( b ). Similarly, the cost in city ( B ) should be at least ( a + 1 ) if the cost in city ( A ) was ( a ). 5. **Summarize increments**: - Notice that any new train introduced between cities ( A ) and ( B ) increments the sum of the city costs by at least 2 since each city’s cost must increase by at least 1 and this sum eventually becomes ( n(n-1)/2 ). 6. **Termination criteria**: - When all ( n(n-1)/2 ) express trains are introduced, the total increase guarantees that at least one city will end up with an express train route length of ( n-1 ).

By the properties of circles and the angles at point ( P ), we have: [ angle AHP = angle PFE ] Thus points ( P ), ( D ), ( F ), and ( H ) lie on the same circle. This means ( P ), ( D ), ( F ), and ( H ) are concyclic. 9. **Angles in Concyclic Quadrilateral**: [ angle BPG = angle AHF ] 10. **More Angle Relations**: [ angle FCB = angle EFC = angle CPE ] This follows from ( EF parallel AB ). 11. **Transitive Angle Equality**: [ angle FCB = angle BPG ] and [ angle BPG = angle APG ] 12.

First, since a_1 > 0 and we need the sum S_n < 1 for all n, it is required that the first term a_1 and the common ratio q of the geometric sequence to both be positive and less than 1. This ensures that the terms in the sequence tend to decrease towards zero. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by: S_n = a_1 frac{1-q^n}{1-q} For S_n < 1 to hold true for all n, it must be that the common ratio q satisfies 0 < q < 1. As an example, we can take a_1 = frac{1}{2} and q = frac{1}{2}. These choices satisfy both a_1 > 0 and S_n < 1. With a_1 = frac{1}{2} and q = frac{1}{2}, the general term formula of a geometric sequence is: a_n = a_1 q^{n-1} Substituting in the values gives: a_n = left(frac{1}{2}right) left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1} Simplifying this, we have: a_n = frac{1}{2^n} Therefore, an example of a sequence that satisfies all the conditions is: a_n = frac{1}{2^n} quad (ninmathbb{N}^*) Note: The answer is not unique, as any a_1 and q satisfying 0 < a_1 < 1 and 0 < q < 1 will work.

We need to show: lim_{x_n to a} log_b(x_n) = log_b(a). 2. **Transformation Using Limit Properties:** Since (x_n to a), it implies: lim_{x_n to a} frac{x_n}{a} = 1. 3. **Properties of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:** Using the property that for any base (b > 0) and (b neq 1), the exponential function (b^{log_b y} = y), we have: b^{log_b left(frac{x_n}{a}right)} = frac{x_n}{a}. 4. **Limit of the Exponential Function:** Consequently, lim_{x_n to a} b^{log_bleft(frac{x_n}{a}right)} = lim_{x_n to a} frac{x_n}{a} = 1. 5. **Applying Logarithm:** Taking the limit inside the logarithm, we obtain: lim_{x_n to a} log_bleft(frac{x_n}{a}right) = log_b(1) = 0. 6. **Sum of Logarithms:** Recall the property of logarithms that (log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)).

The hub rotates fully from (C) to (D), yet why is (CD) not equal to the circumference of the inner circle?","completion":"# Problem: Consider a wheel with a diameter of 28 cm that makes a full revolution, covering the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ). This distance ( AB ) is equal to the circumference of the wheel, which we can approximate. To approximate this circumference, we multiply the diameter by ( frac{22}{7} ), giving us (-88) cm.

This is clearly incorrect. Here, we must identify the mistake in the reasoning. To find the mistake, we need to break down the problem: 1. **Determine Circumference of the Wheel:** - The diameter of the wheel is ( 28 ) cm. - Using the formula for circumference ( C ), ( C = pi times d ). - Employing ( pi approx frac{22}{7} ): [ C = 28 times frac{22}{7} = 88 text{ cm} ] - For more precision, employing ( pi approx 3.1416 ): [ C approx 28 times 3.1416 = 87.9648 text{ cm} ] 2. **Inner Circle’s Journey:** - If the wheel’s diameter is ( 28 ) cm, the inner circle (hub) has a smaller diameter. - Assume the hub's diameter is half of the wheel's diameter: ( 14 ) cm. - Compute the circumference of the hub, ( C ): [ C_{text{hub}} = 14 times pi = 14 times frac{22}{7} = 44 text{ cm} ] 3. **Revolution of the Inner Circle:** - The assertion in the problem is that the inner circle (hub) covers distance ( CD ), equal to ( AB ), in one revolution, suggesting equal circumferences. - The hub’s circumference is significantly shorter than the wheel's circumference (( 44 ) cm vs. ( 88 ) cm), which invalidates this assertion. 4. **Error Identification:** - The mistake is assuming the hub (inner circle) makes a full revolution along the same line ( CD ) as the outer circle (AB). - The hub completes one full revolution covering a shorter distance due to its smaller circumference. It does not cover the same ( AB ) distance as the outer wheel. 5. **Point Trajectories:** - The outer wheel completes a full cycle, causing points around its edge to move in a cycloidal path. - Inner points along the hub form a trochoid, combining rotation and translation differently. 6. **Trajectory and Distance Covered:** - The wheel’s center point forms a direct path (describing a translational movement through ( AB )). - Reviewing the exact paths and positions of points helps reinforce the understanding of different distances due to varying circumferences and radial distances of rotating segments. 7. **Cycloid Curve Length:** - If the wheel has a circumference (88) cm, the point trajectories like cycloids and trochoids span multiple factors based on their shapes and movement. - Specifically, a cycloid described by the wheel: [ text{Length of cycloid} = 4 times text{Diameter} = 4 times 28 = 112 text{ cm} ] 8. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{112 text{ cm}} ] This thorough reanalysis confirms errors in assuming equal circumferences and highlights the diverse coverage by different circumferential points."},{"prompt":"The constant term in the expansion of (sqrt{x} + 3)(sqrt{x} frac{2}{x})^5 is ______.","completion":"To solve this, we expand (sqrt{x} + 3)(sqrt{x} - frac{2}{x})^5 as (sqrt{x} + 3)(C_{5}^{0}x^{frac{5}{2}} - C_{5}^{1} cdot 2x + C_{5}^{2} cdot 4x^{-frac{1}{2}} - C_{5}^{3} cdot 8x^{-2} + C_{5}^{4} cdot 16x^{-frac{7}{2}} - C_{5}^{5} cdot 32x^{-5}).

Find the number of 9 dimensional subsubfaces in a 12 dimensional cube.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to find the number of 9-dimensional sub-subfaces in a 12-dimensional cube. A sub-subface of a cube is a lower-dimensional face of the cube. For example, in a 3-dimensional cube (a regular cube), a 2-dimensional subface is a square face, a 1-dimensional subface is an edge, and a 0-dimensional subface is a vertex. 2. **Generalizing the concept**: In an (n)-dimensional cube, a (k)-dimensional subface is formed by fixing (n-k) coordinates to either 0 or 1 and allowing the remaining (k) coordinates to vary. 3. **Choosing the dimensions**: To form a 9-dimensional subface in a 12-dimensional cube, we need to choose 9 dimensions out of the 12 to vary. The number of ways to choose 9 dimensions out of 12 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{12}{9} ] Using the property of binomial coefficients, we know that: [ binom{12}{9} = binom{12}{3} ] This is because (binom{n}{k} = binom{n}{n-k}). 4. **Calculating the binomial coefficient**: [ binom{12}{3} = frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = frac{12!}{3! cdot 9!} ] Simplifying the factorials: [ binom{12}{3} = frac{12 times 11 times 10}{3 times 2 times 1} = 220 ] 5. **Counting the subfaces**: Each choice of 9 dimensions corresponds to a 9-dimensional subface. For each of these choices, the remaining 3 dimensions can each be fixed to either 0 or 1, giving (2^3 = 8) possible ways to fix the remaining dimensions. 6. **Multiplying the results**: Therefore, the total number of 9-dimensional subfaces is: [ 8 times 220 = 1760 ] The final answer is (boxed{1760})."},{"prompt":"is known that S_n is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, and S_6 > S_7 > S_5.

The function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x is a downward-facing parabola with the vertex at the line of symmetry x = frac{-b}{2a} = 1. Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the vertex is the maximum point on the interval. First, we find the value of the function at the endpoints of the interval: - When x = -2, f(-2) = -(-2)^2 + 2(-2) = -4 - 4 = -8. - When x = 3, f(3) = -(3)^2 + 2(3) = -9 + 6 = -3.

However, the minimum value cannot occur at the vertex since it's the maximum point for this parabola. Therefore, the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints. Comparing f(-2) = -8 and f(3) = -3, we see that the minimum value of f(x) on the given interval is -8 at x = -2.

These functions are said to have the same axis of symmetry. 2. **Identifying omega**: Since the functions are symmetrical and given the form of g(x), we deduce that the periodicity of both functions must match. The periodicity of f(x) is determined by omega, and for g(x), it's determined by the coefficient of x in the cosine function, which is 2. Therefore, we conclude omega = 2. 3. **Transforming g(x)**: The cosine function can be transformed into a sine function using the identity cos(theta) = sin(theta + frac{pi}{2}). Applying this to g(x), we get g(x) = 2sin(2x + varphi + frac{pi}{2}). 4. **Equating Phases**: For the graphs to be symmetrical, the phase shift of the sine functions derived from f(x) and g(x) must be related. Thus, we equate 2x - frac{pi}{3} from f(x) to 2x + varphi + frac{pi}{2} from the transformed g(x). 5. **Solving for varphi**: Setting the phase shifts equal gives us varphi + frac{pi}{2} = -frac{pi}{3} + kpi, where k in mathbb{Z} (since the sine function is periodic with period 2pi, we consider all possible phase shifts that would make the functions symmetrical).

Similarly, ( Q(x) ) can be expressed as: [ Q(x) = frac{x^{b(a+1)} - 1}{x^b - 1}. ] 2. **Determine the conditions for divisibility:** For ( P(x) ) to divide ( Q(x) ), it follows that: [ frac{x^{a+1} - 1}{x - 1} mid frac{x^{b(a+1)} - 1}{x^b - 1}. ] This can be simplified to studying whether: [ (x^{a+1} - 1)(x^b - 1) mid (x^{b(a+1)} - 1)(x - 1). ] 3. **Factorization and common roots:** Both ( x^{a+1} - 1 ) and ( x^b - 1 ) are cyclotomic polynomials, and they share a common factor of ( x - 1 ). Hence, the question reduces to checking if their highest common factor leads to ( 1 ) as the only common root: Thus, if ( a+1 ) and ( b ) are relatively prime, then ( x^{a+1} - 1 ) and ( x^b - 1 ) will only share the factor ( x - 1 ) and no higher order roots. 4. **Verify common factors:** If ( d ) is a common factor of ( a+1 ) and ( b ), let: [ zeta = e^{2pi i / d} ] where ( zeta ) is a ( d )-th root of unity. Then, ( zeta ) is a root of both ( x^{a+1} - 1 ) and ( x^b - 1 ). It implies it is also a root of ( x^{b(a+1)} - 1 ). However, we need the multiplicity of roots in the product divisor to match the dividend. If ( d > 1 ), ( zeta ) will appear in both polynomials more than once, leading to incompatibility in the intended divisibility. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the condition for ( P(x) ) to divide ( Q(x) ) is that ( a+1 ) and ( b ) must be relatively prime integers (i.e., ( gcd(a+1, b) = 1 )).

We compare it to the known formula for telescoping series: frac{1}{1 cdot 2} + frac{1}{2 cdot 3} + cdots + frac{1}{n (n+1)} = frac{n}{n+1} Notice that in this case, it's obvious that if (f(n) = n), the series becomes exactly the same. 3.

Therefore, angle BCD = 150^circ. Since lines overline{AM} and overline{CD} are extended to meet at P, the angle angle BCP = 180^circ - angle BCD = 180^circ - 150^circ = 30^circ. Similarly, since angle BCD = 150^circ, the exterior angle at B becomes angle PAB = 30^circ. The reflex angle at B, being part of the internal angle of ABCP, measures 360^circ - 150^circ = 210^circ. Now, adding up the angles in quadrilateral ABCP gives: [ angle PAB + text{reflex }angle B + angle BCP + angle P = 360^circ ] Filling in known values: [ 30^circ + 210^circ + 30^circ + angle P = 360^circ ] Solving for angle P: [ angle P = 360^circ - 270^circ = boxed{90^circ} ] Conclusion: The final answer checks out logically and maintains the consistency of the quadrilateral angle sum theory."},{"prompt":"Let S equal{} {1,2,ldots,2008} .
