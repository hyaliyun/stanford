Thus, the recurrence is P_n = P_{n-1} + P_{n-2} + P_{n-3} + P_{n-4}.

Let E and F be the points where ell intersects sides AB and BC respectively. 3. **Consider Similar Triangles**: Since AD parallel CF and AE parallel CD, we can consider triangles AED and CDF. We need to prove that these triangles are similar. For this, notice the following: - Both triangles share the angles at D (which is a common angle). - Given AD parallel CF, it implies that angle ADE = angle DCF since they are alternate interior angles. - Similarly, given AE parallel CD, it implies that angle EAD = angle FCD. Therefore, triangle AED sim triangle CDF by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity. 4. **Form Ratios from Similar Triangles**: Using the similarity, we have: frac{AE}{CD} = frac{AD}{CF} Note that AD = CD = AC (since all the sides of the rhombus ABCD are equal). Thus, we can write: frac{AE}{AC} = frac{AC}{CF} 5. **Establish another pair of similar triangles**: We need to show that triangle EAC sim triangle ACF: - From the previous result: frac{AE}{AC} = frac{AC}{CF}. - Next, compare the angles angle EAC and angle ACF. - Since triangle ABC is equilateral, angle BAC = 60^circ. - So, angle EAC = 180^circ - angle BAC = 120^circ. - Thus, angle ACF = 120^circ as both these angles are along the same line ell after reflecting about the axis passing through C. Both conditions satisfy AA similarity for triangle EAC and triangle ACF. 6. **Use the Tangency Condition**: Since triangles triangle EAC sim triangle ACF, it follows that angle CAE = angle CAF. Hence, line AC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle AME at point A. 7. **Apply Power of a Point Theorem**: By the Power of a Point Theorem, applied to point C and the tangency point A of circle passing through A, M, and E: CA^2 = CM cdot CE 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have: CA^2 = CM times CE This completes the proof.

Therefore, a^{2}+b^{2}=2. (2) From the problem, lines l_1, l_2 are symmetric about the origin, and the center of circle W: x^{2}+y^{2}=4 is the origin O. Thus, overrightarrow{AB}=overrightarrow{DC}, and quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram. It is easy to know that point O is on the diagonals AC, BD. Solving the system of equations begin{cases}x^{2}+y^{2}=4 y=2x- sqrt {10}end{cases}, we get 5x^{2}-4 sqrt {10}x+6=0. From x_{1}+x_{2}= dfrac {4 sqrt {10}}{5}, x_{1}x_{2}= dfrac {6}{5}, we obtain overrightarrow{OA}cdot overrightarrow{OB}=x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=x_{1}x_{2}+(2x_{1}- sqrt {10})(2x_{2}- sqrt {10})=5x_{1}x_{2}-2 sqrt {10}(x_{1}+x_{2})+10=6-2 sqrt {10}cdot dfrac {4 sqrt {10}}{5}+10=0. Therefore, overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB}, and consequently overrightarrow{AC} perp overrightarrow{BD}. Since |overrightarrow{AC}|=|overrightarrow{BD}|=4, quadrilateral ABCD is a square. (3) Proof: Assume that there exists an inscribed square in the ellipse W: dfrac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1, and its four vertices are A, B, C, D. When the slope of line AB does not exist, let the equations of lines AB, CD be x=m, x=n. Since A, B, C, D are on the ellipse, we have A(m,- sqrt {1- dfrac {m^{2}}{2}}), B(m, sqrt {1- dfrac {m^{2}}{2}}), C(n,- sqrt {1- dfrac {n^{2}}{2}}), D(n, sqrt {1- dfrac {n^{2}}{2}}). As quadrilateral ABCD is a square, it is easy to know that m= dfrac { sqrt {6}}{3}, n=- dfrac { sqrt {6}}{3}, and the equations of lines AB, CD are x= dfrac { sqrt {6}}{3}, x=- dfrac { sqrt {6}}{3}. The area of square ABCD is S= dfrac {2 sqrt {6}}{3}cdot dfrac {2 sqrt {6}}{3}= dfrac {8}{3}. When the slope of line AB exists, let the equations of lines AB, CD be l_{AB}: y=kx+m, l_{CD}: y=kx+n (kneq 0, mneq 0), respectively. Obviously, mneq n. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}), C(x_{3},y_{3}), D(x_{4},y_{4}), we solve the system of equations begin{cases}dfrac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1 y=kx+mend{cases} to obtain (1+2k^{2})x^{2}+4kmx+2m^{2}-2=0. Thus, x_{1}+x_{2}=- dfrac {4km}{1+2k^{2}}, x_{1}x_{2}= dfrac {2m^{2}-2}{1+2k^{2}}. Substituting into |AB|^{2}=(1+k^{2})[(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}], we get |AB|^{2}=8(1+k^{2})cdot dfrac {2k^{2}-m^{2}+1}{(1+2k^{2})^{2}}. Similarly, we can find |CD|^{2}=8(1+k^{2})cdot dfrac {2k^{2}-n^{2}+1}{(1+2k^{2})^{2}}. Since ABCD is a square, |AB|^{2}=|CD|^{2}, which implies m^{2}=n^{2}. However, as mneq n, we have m=-n. Therefore, lines AB and CD are symmetric about the origin O. Consequently, the origin O is the center of the square (since m=-n, we know overrightarrow{AB}=overrightarrow{DC}, and quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram). Since ABCD is a square, overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB}, i.e., overrightarrow{OA}cdot overrightarrow{OB}=x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=(1+k^{2})x_{1}x_{2}+km(x_{1}+x_{2})+m^{2}=0. Substituting, we get dfrac {3m^{2}-2k^{2}-2}{1+2k^{2}}=0, which yields m^{2}= dfrac {2(k^{2}+1)}{3} (note that at this time quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus). As ABCD is a square, |AB|=|AD|. Since the distance between lines AB and CD is |AD|= dfrac {|m-n|}{ sqrt {1+k^{2}}}, m=-n, we have |AD|^{2}= dfrac {4m^{2}}{1+k^{2}}= dfrac {4cdot dfrac {2(k^{2}+1)}{3}}{1+k^{2}}= dfrac {8}{3}. However, |AB|^{2}=8(1+k^{2})cdot dfrac {2k^{2}-m^{2}+1}{(1+2k^{2})^{2}}= dfrac {8}{3}cdot dfrac {(1+k^{2})(1+4k^{2})}{(1+2k^{2})^{2}}. From dfrac {(1+k^{2})(1+4k^{2})}{(1+2k^{2})^{2}}=1, we obtain 4k^{4}+5k^{2}+1=4k^{4}+4k^{2}+1, which implies k^{2}=0, i.e., k=0. This contradicts kneq 0. Therefore, |AD|^{2}neq |AB|^{2}, which contradicts |AD|=|AB|. Hence, when the slope kneq 0 of line AB exists, there is no square inside the ellipse. In summary, there is only one inscribed square in the ellipse W: dfrac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1, and its area is S=boxed{dfrac{8}{3}}."},{"prompt":"Let ( f(x) = x^2 + x + 4 ) and ( g(x) = 3x^3 + 2 ).

Since ( k ) is divisible by 4, it has at least these divisors: 1, ( k ), ( frac{k}{2} ), and ( frac{k}{4} ). 10. For ( n > 28 ), the divisors ( k ), ( frac{k}{2} ), and ( frac{k}{4} ) are distinct because ( frac{k}{4} neq 1 ). 11. The sum of these divisors is: [ 1 + frac{k}{4} + frac{k}{2} + k = 1 + frac{7k}{4}. ] 12. This sum must be greater than ( frac{7k}{4} ): [ 1 + frac{k}{4} + frac{k}{2} + k = 1 + frac{7k}{4} + 1. ] 13.

Income, which is money coming in, is recorded as a positive number. Therefore, if an income of 100 yuan is recorded as +100 yuan, we are following this standard convention. Now, considering the opposite type of transaction, which is an expenditure (money going out), we apply the opposite sign to indicate the opposite effect on the financial balance. Thus, an expenditure of 120 yuan, being the opposite of income, is recorded with the opposite sign, making it -120 yuan.

Find the number of ways to place 51 quaggas on an (8 times 8) chessboard in such a way that no quagga attacks another.","completion":"Let us rewrite the solution step-by-step with more details and references to fully understand the process and the final answer. 1. **Model the problem using graph theory:** Represent the 8 times 8 chessboard as a graph where each square is a vertex. Two vertices are connected by an edge if a quagga can move from one to the other. Thus, the edges represent the possible quagga moves: moving 6 squares in one direction and 5 squares perpendicularly. 2. **Analyze the movement:** Given the quagga's movement rules, we see that any quagga placed on the board can potentially attack another quagga if it can reach that vertex using its movement pattern. Specifically: - A quagga can move 6 squares in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). - It then moves 5 squares in a perpendicular direction (either on the left or right from its previous path). 3. **Graph separation into paths and isolated vertices:** Upon close inspection of the moves (6 and 5 squares) on an 8 times 8 board, most squares do not allow these moves to stay within the board's bounds, creating many isolated vertices as they can't reach another square legally. Specifically: - The board turns out to have 32 isolated vertices because no legal quagga move initiates or ends at these squares. - Additionally, the board contains specific paths that reflect cycles of valid movements: - There are four paths of length 5. - There are four paths of length 3. 4. **Maximize non-attacking placements:** Next, we want to place the maximum number of quaggas without them attacking each other. For this, we must determine the fitting of quaggas within these paths: - Each path of length 5 can accommodate at most 3 non-attacking quaggas (placed on the first, middle, and last vertices of the path). Therefore, the total quaggas for four such paths: [ 4 times 3 = 12 ] - Each path of length 3 can accommodate at most 2 non-attacking quaggas in a unique manner. Therefore, for four such paths: [ 4 times 2 = 8 ] Adding the maximum placements on paths with isolated vertices, we get: [ 12 + 8 + 32 = 52 ] Thus, the total maximum number of non-attacking quaggas is 52. 5. **Required non-attacking placements of 51 quaggas:** Since we need 51 quaggas, we look to place one less quagga than the maximum in one of the components: - If the deficient component is a path of length 5. The number of ways to place 2 quaggas instead of 3 quaggas in nonadjacent positions on any path is: [ binom{5}{2} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 ] Multiplying for 4 paths gives: [ 4 times 6 = 24 ] - If the deficient component is a path of length 3. There are 3 ways to place one quagga instead of 2 quaggas: [ 4 times 3 = 12 ] - If the deficient component is an isolated vertex, we leave it empty.

The solid angle at the (i)-th vertex is given by: [ Omega_i = sigma_i - (n_i - 2)pi. ] Here (sigma_i) is the sum of all dihedral angles at vertex (i), and ((n_i - 2)pi) accounts for the sum of the exterior angles around the vertex. 2. **Summing Over All Vertices:** Summing these solid angles over all vertices, we get: [ sum_{i} Omega_i = sum_{i} sigma_i - sum_{i} (n_i - 2)pi. ] 3. **Relating ( sum_i sigma_i ) and ( sum_{i} n_i ):** Since each edge contributes exactly twice in the total of dihedral angles (once at each end of the edge), we have: [ sigma = sum_{i} sigma_i, ] where (sigma) is the total sum of all dihedral angles in the polyhedron. Also, each edge has two vertices, hence: [ sum_{i} n_i = 2P, ] where (P) is the total number of edges. 4. **Simplifying Total Sum of Solid Angles:** Then we substitute these into the sum of solid angles: [ sum_{i} Omega_i = sigma - pi sum_{i} (n_i - 2) = sigma - pi (2P - 2B), ] where (B) is the total number of vertices. 5. **Using Euler’s Formula:** By Euler's polyhedron formula, we know: [ P - B + Gamma = 2, ] thus: [ P - B = Gamma - 2. ] 6. **Final Calculation:** Substitute (P - B = Gamma - 2) into the previous equation: [ sum_{i} Omega_i = sigma - pi (2(Gamma - 2)) = sigma - 2 pi(Gamma - 2). ] 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the sum of dihedral angles minus the sum of solid angles at the vertices is: [ sigma - sum_{i} Omega_i = 2pi(Gamma - 2). ] Thus, we have successfully shown that the difference between the sum of the dihedral angles at the edges and the sum of the solid angles at the vertices is (2pi(Gamma-2)).

Thus, ( alpha^{2n} + alpha^n + 1 = 0 ). 3. **Divisibility**: - This implies ( Phi_{3k}(x) mid x^{2n} + x^n + 1 ), and consequently ( Phi_{3k}(x) mid Phi_{3k}(x^{2n} + x^n + x + 1) ). - Letting ( x = n ), we have ( Phi_{3k}(n) mid Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) ) as integers. 4. **Distinct Primes**: - For different ( k ) dividing ( n ), choose any primes ( p_k ) that divide ( Phi_{3k}(n) ). - We claim that these primes are distinct. By standard argument, either ( n ) has multiplicative order ( 3k ) (mod ( p_k )), or ( p_k mid 3k ). - In the former case, ( p_k ) is indeed different from other ( p_j ). In the latter scenario, either ( p_k = 3 ) or ( p_k mid n ), which is ruled out as ( Phi_{3k}(n) equiv 1 pmod{n} ). 5. **Prime Factor Count**: - To prove the claim, it remains to show ( p_k = p_j = 3 ) cannot happen. This is because ( prod_{k mid n} Phi_{3k}(n) = n^{2n} + n^n + 1 ) is not divisible by 9. - With the claim, we have ( p_k mid Phi_{3k}(n) mid Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) mid (n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1)^{2n} + (n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1)^n + 1 ). - Thus, the number has at least ( d(n) ) distinct prime divisors. 6. **Additional Prime Factors**: - To squeeze another ( d(n) ) prime divisors, we will choose primes ( q_k neq p_k ) that divide ( Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) ). - Suppose for the time being that ( q_k neq p_k ) is feasible. We need to show ( q_k neq p_j ) and ( q_k neq q_j ). - The former is because if ( p_j mid Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) ), then from ( p_j mid Phi_{3j}(n) mid n^{2n} + n^n + 1 ), we have ( p_j mid Phi_{3k}(n) ), contradicting our earlier proof that ( Phi_{3j}(n) ) and ( Phi_{3k}(n) ) are co-prime. 7. **Zsigmondy-type Argument**: - To prove ( q_k neq q_j ), we run the same Zsigmondy-type argument as above. Since ( q_k mid Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) ), either ( n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1 ) has multiplicative order ( 3k ) (mod ( p_k )), or ( q_k mid 3k ). - The former leads directly to ( q_k neq q_j ). The latter leads to either ( q_k mid n ) or ( q_k = 3 ). But ( Phi_{3k}(x) equiv 1 pmod{x-1} ), unless ( k = 3^t ) in which case the residue is 3. Thus, ( Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) equiv 1, 3 pmod{n} ). So ( q_k ) cannot both divide ( n ) and ( Phi_{3k}(n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1) ). 8. **Final Contradiction**: - Lastly, consider ( t = 1 ). Then the denominator ( (1 pm frac{lambda}{n})^{2n} ) converges to ( e^{pm 2} ) since ( lambda to 1 ) as ( n ) becomes large (refining the lemma). From the crucial equation above, we then deduce that for large ( n ), ( p^{b-2na} ) must be very close to ( e^{pm 2} ). But ( e^2 ) is not an integer, so again we obtain a contradiction. 9. **Conclusion**: - So we have proved the result for all large ( n ). The number ( (n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1)^{2n} + (n^{2n} + n^n + n + 1)^n + 1 ) has at least ( 2d(n) ) distinct prime factors.

Given that ( p(x) ) is of odd degree, the sign of ( p(x) ) and ( p(-x) ) must be different for sufficiently large ( x ).

This means that both the minute and second hand complete an integer number of rotations relative to the hour hand. 3. **Angular Speeds**: - The hour hand completes 1 full rotation (360 degrees) in 12 hours. - The minute hand completes 1 full rotation in 1 hour, so it moves 12 times faster than the hour hand. - The second hand completes 1 full rotation in 1 minute, so it moves 720 times faster than the hour hand. 4. **Relative Speeds**: - Therefore, the speed of the minute hand relative to the hour hand is 12 - 1 = 11 times the speed of the hour hand. - The speed of the second hand relative to the hour hand is 720 - 1 = 719 times the speed of the hour hand. 5. **Finding Repetition**: - Let ( k ) be the number of rotations made by the minute hand relative to the hour hand. - The second hand will complete ( frac{719}{11} cdot k ) rotations in the same time. 6. **Integer Condition**: - For the configuration to repeat, ( frac{719}{11} cdot k ) must be an integer. - This number is an integer only if ( k ) is a multiple of 11 (since ( 719 ) and ( 11 ) are co-prime). 7. **Time Period Calculation**: - If ( k ) is a multiple of 11, the minimum ( k ) for which this occurs is 11. - Hence, the minute hand will make 11 rotations relative to the hour hand, which takes ( 12 ) hours. 8. **Conclusion**: - Since ( 12 ) hours are required for the relative position to repeat, it means within a period from 8:00 to 19:59 (which is 12 hours), the configuration of the clock hands does not repeat.

Considering that b^2 + c^2 geq 2bc, we have bc + 4 geq 2bc, which implies bc leq 4. The equality holds if and only if b = c. Thus, the area S is maximized at: S = frac { sqrt {3}}{4}bc leq frac { sqrt {3}}{4} times 4 = sqrt {3}. At the maximum area of triangle ABC, we have b = c.

This is because if any of these terms were greater than (frac{1}{2}), it would leave less than (frac{1}{2}) for the sum of the other two terms, which also need to be (leq frac{1}{2}) to satisfy the equation. Therefore, we must have ( a, b, c > 1 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( 1 < a leq b leq c ).

To do this, we will analyze two cases: when ( f ) is constant and when ( f ) is nonconstant. Case 1: ( f ) is a constant function. Let's denote the constant value by ( c ). So, ( f(x) = c ) for all ( x in mathbb{Z} ). - Consider any surjective function ( g: mathbb{Z} rightarrow mathbb{Z} ). Since ( g ) is surjective, for every ( y in mathbb{Z} ), there exists some ( x in mathbb{Z} ) such that ( g(x) = y - c ). - Therefore, [ (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = c + (y - c) = y, ] which means ( f + g ) is surjective. Thus, any constant function ( f ) ensures ( f + g ) is surjective for any surjective ( g ). Case 2: ( f ) is nonconstant. We need to verify if there exists a surjective ( g ) such that ( f + g ) is not surjective. Let us denote the elements in ( mathbb{Z} ) with a countable sequence ( S = {s_0, s_1, s_2, ldots } ). Assume ( f ) is nonconstant. We consider two scenarios for the function's values. 1. **Suppose ( f ) equals a constant value ( c ) for cofinitely many ( s_i )'s**: Suppose: [ begin{aligned} f(s_0) &= t_0, f(s_1) &= t_1, &vdots f(s_n) &= t_n, f(s_{n+1}) &= c, f(s_{n+2}) &= c, &vdots end{aligned} ] where ( t_i neq 0 ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, n ) and ( n > 0 ) since ( f ) is nonconstant. We define the function ( g ) such that ( f+g ) avoids zero: [ begin{aligned} g(s_0) &= -t_0, g(s_1) &= -t_1, &vdots g(s_n) &= -t_n, g(s_{n+1}) &= 1, g(s_{n+2}) &= 2, &vdots end{aligned} ] And choose remaining values so that each integer is covered. Since ( g ) is surjective, ( f + g ) will take every integer value. 2. **Otherwise**: We construct ( g ) inductively as follows: - ( g(s_0) ) is the smallest integer not equal to (-f(s_0)), - ( g(s_1) ) is the smallest integer not used and not equal to (-f(s_1)), - Continue this process for all ( s_n ). By this method, ( f+g ) will never equal zero by construction, and since each ( y in mathbb{Z} ) has infinitely many ( s_n ) such that ( f(s_n) neq -y ), ( g ) will eventually take every integer value. Therefore, for ( f ) to make ( f+g ) surjective for every surjective ( g ), ( f ) must be a constant function. Nonconstant ( f ) necessarily results in ( f + g ) not being surjective for some ( g ).

To check this, we compute the square of 21.4: [ (21.4)^2 = 457.96 ] Rounding 457.96 to the nearest integer gives us 458. Hence, 458 is very close to ((21.4)^2). 2. **Exploration of Other Numbers:** We note that numbers close to perfect squares like 45796 are useful. We consider another number, 236: [ 236 = 9 times 25 + 11 ] Squaring 236, we get: [ 236^2 = 55696 ] Analyzing this expression, since ( 55696 = (250B + C)^2 ) where ( B ) and ( C ) are integers, ( sqrt{55696} approx 236 ).

The complement of A in the universal set mathbb{R} is mathbb{R} setminus A = (-infty, -2sqrt{7}) cup (2sqrt{7}, +infty). Next, we analyze the set B based on the quadratic inequality 2x^2 - (5+m)x + 5 leq 0. To find the values of x that satisfy the inequality, we need to determine the roots of the quadratic equation 2x^2 - (5+m)x + 5 = 0. Let's denote the roots by r_1 and r_2. For the set B to be a subset of mathbb{R} setminus A, the interval of B has to lie entirely outside the interval [-2sqrt{7}, 2sqrt{7}]. This implies that we either need to have r_1 leq -2sqrt{7} and r_2 leq -2sqrt{7} or r_1 geq 2sqrt{7} and r_2 geq 2sqrt{7}. Analyzing the quadratic formula for the roots of B, we have: r_{1,2} = frac{5+m pm sqrt{(5+m)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 5}}{2 cdot 2} Since (5+m)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 5 = m^2 + 10m + 25 - 40 = m^2 + 10m - 15, the discriminant Delta = (5+m)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 5 must be non-negative for real roots to exist. Hence, we need m^2 + 10m - 15 geq 0. Let's find the roots of m^2 + 10m - 15 = 0: m_{1,2} = frac{-10 pm sqrt{100 + 4 cdot 15}}{2} = frac{-10 pm sqrt{160}}{2} = frac{-10 pm 4sqrt{10}}{2} Therefore, m_1 = -5 - 2sqrt{10} and m_2 = -5 + 2sqrt{10}. These values of m cause the discriminant to be zero, resulting in the quadratic equation having one repeated root. For values of m in the interval (-5 - 2sqrt{10}, -5 + 2sqrt{10}), the discriminant will be positive and the quadratic equation will have two distinct real roots. Now, we need to verify which values of m will place the interval of B completely outside [-2sqrt{7}, 2sqrt{7}]. We can break this into cases: If m < -5 - 2sqrt{10} or m > -5 + 2sqrt{10}, the parabola 2x^2 - (5+m)x + 5 will be upward-facing, and the vertex of the parabola will lie outside the interval of A, satisfying B subseteq mathbb{R} setminus A. If -5 - 2sqrt{10} < m < -5 + 2sqrt{10}, the parabola will be downward-facing. However, to make sure B is outside the interval of A, the roots must not be in [-2sqrt{7}, 2sqrt{7}]. To ensure this, we can set a condition that both roots must be greater than 2sqrt{7} or less than -2sqrt{7}. From this, we can conclude that m needs to be greater than 2sqrt{7} (as the leading coefficient of the quadratic is positive). Taking all these conditions into account, we find that the range of values for m is: m < -5 - 2sqrt{10} quad text{or} quad m > -5 + 2sqrt{10} Therefore, the real number m must be in the unions of these intervals for B to be a subset of mathbb{R} setminus A.

Each digit among a and b is unique. 2. **Set constraints on a and b**: Since a and b are three-digit numbers and all digits are different, we can assume without loss of generality that a < b. The hundreds digits of a and b must be at least 1 and 2 respectively, so a geq 100 and b geq 200. 3. **Express a and b in terms of other variables**: Let a = 100 + p and b = 200 + q. Then, a + b = 300 + p + q. We want a + b = S to be a three-digit number, so p + q must be a two-digit number less than 100. 4. **Choose p and q to minimize the sum of the digits of S**: We need to find p and q such that p + q = 100 and all digits involved are distinct and not 1 or 2 (since those are already used in the hundreds places of a and b). 5. **Find a specific solution**: Let's try p = 3 and q = 97.

The segment of 3a could be a diagonal that connects two non-adjacent vertices. 3. **Consideration of the triangle inequality and geometric shape**: For the pentagon to hold, each triangle within it (created by the diagonals and sides) must satisfy the triangle inequality. Considering a configuration where b is another diagonal of the pentagon, we can hypothesize that b is the diagonal across from the segment 3a. 4. **Formation of triangles and calculating b**: In a regular pentagon, diagonals split the pentagon into triangles with angles that divide the 360° evenly. The relevant diagonals in this case would form a larger triangle within the pentagon. Using the law of sines in the triangle formed by a, 3a, and b (assuming angles of 108^circ, which are typical in a regular pentagon), we calculate b.

(b) Considering the logic and justifications in point (a), present at least two different methods of calculating cashback that would allow banks to at least partially avoid the problems they face in the situation described in point (a).","completion":"**(a)** 1. **Identification of the Problem**: - Banks often propose various loyalty programs, including cashback schemes. These programs are designed with the expectation that the average consumer will make regular purchases across various categories using their bank cards. 2. **Behavior of Financially Savvy Customers**: - Many customers who are well-versed in financial products have realized that they can increase their benefits by using multiple cashback cards for different spending categories. - These customers might hold several cards with tailored cashback rewards for specific expenditures (e.g., one card for restaurants, another for supermarkets, a third for fuel purchases, etc.). 3. **Increased Number of Financially Savvy Customers**: - The number of such savvy users is growing, as they share strategies and experiences with each other on how to maximize the benefits from loyalty programs. 4. **Banks’ Calculations and Challenges**: - Banks typically forecast the average cashback return based on the spending habits of a typical customer across various expense categories. This calculation assumes that not all customers will optimize their cashback returns. - However, when customers use multiple cards to maximize their cashback, the total amount paid out in cashback by the banks increases, reducing the overall profitability of the loyalty programs for the banks. 5. **Example**: - A customer could use one card solely for dining to get a high cashback percentage on that category, another card for supermarket purchases, and yet another for fuel. This behavior diverges from the average scenario that banks anticipate, leading to more significant cashback payouts than planned. 6. **Additional Example**: - Customers may also withdraw cash from their accounts and use it for payments instead of their cards. This deprives the bank of transaction fees that would have been generated had the card been used for payments, further compounding the problem. # Conclusion: This kind of customer behavior can significantly diminish the expected financial gain from cashback programs, thus making such offers less advantageous for the banks. **(b)** 1. **Dynamic Cashback Rates**: - **Description**: Implement dynamic cashback rates that adjust based on customer behavior. For example, the cashback percentage decreases as a customer’s total cashback amount increases. - **Benefit**: This prevents financially savvy customers from gaining excessive benefits by spreading their spending across multiple cards. 2. **Categorical Caps and Rotating Categories**: - **Description**: Set monthly or quarterly caps on cashback amounts for individual spending categories (e.g., a limit on how much cashback can be earned on groceries each month). - **Benefit**: By rotating categories each period, banks can control and predict cashback payouts more effectively, deterring customers from optimizing for specific high-reward categories continuously. # Conclusion: These approaches help banks avoid substantial losses from over-utilization of cashback benefits by financially literate customers while still maintaining attractive loyalty programs for the broader user base. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f the base of a parallelogram that has an area of 24 square centimeters (cm2) is 4 centimeters (cm), find the difference between the height and the length of the base.","completion":"The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula: Area = Base × Height We are given that the area of the parallelogram is 24 cm² and the base is 4 cm.

We also know that A beats B by 18 seconds, which means B takes (t + 18) seconds to cover the 948 meters. Now, we can set up two equations based on the information given: 1. A's speed is the distance covered by the time taken, so: v = 1000 / t 2. B's speed is the distance B covers by the time B takes, which is the same as A's speed (since they are both running the same race, just finishing at different times), so: v = 948 / (t + 18) Since both expressions equal v, we can set them equal to each other: 1000 / t = 948 / (t + 18) Now, we can solve for t: 1000(t + 18) = 948t 1000t + 18000 = 948t 1000t - 948t = -18000 52t = -18000 This equation doesn't make sense because time cannot be negative.

We divide the rectangle into segments with lengths 1 (short sides) and 2 (long sides). We analyze point placement and distances: 1. Without loss of generality, assume the first point A is on the bottom side (length 2). The possible regions for the second point B to satisfy the distance condition can include parts of the opposite long side and potentially parts of the adjacent short sides. 2. **Long sides**: The entire opposite long side (length 2) will always be at least 1 unit away from any point on the first long side. Hence, any point on the opposite long side is valid. 3. **Short sides**: Consider the placement on the short side adjacent to where A is placed. The distance d from A to a point B on the adjacent short side must satisfy d^2 = x^2 + 1, where x is the horizontal distance from A to the corner plus the side length of the short side. Solving d geq 1, we get x^2 + 1 geq 1, which holds for any x. However, for points directly above or below A across a short side (i.e., x=0), d=1, which is just on the boundary. By symmetry and averaging, the probability that B on the adjacent and opposite short sides will satisfy the distance requirement depends on specific calculations involving the corners and immediate sides, but we can simplify by considering the larger segments primarily first. The opposite long side (length 2) is always valid, contributing 2 units to favorable outcomes.

Taking the derivative of V with respect to r, we get V'(r) = frac{1}{2}S - 3pi r^{2}. Solving for V'(r) > 0, we find that 0 < r < frac{sqrt{6pi S}}{6pi}.

This creates the following counts: - The first line: divides the circle into 2 pieces. - The second line intersects the first: divides each segment into two, giving a total of 4 pieces. - The third line intersects both previous lines in 3 new points, dividing the existing 4 pieces into 13 different sections. - To generalize, the maximum number of regions formed by ( n ) lines can be given by the formula: [ P(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 ] - For ( n = 3 ): [ P(3) = frac{3(3+1)}{2} + 1 = frac{12}{2} + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 ] Therefore, concluding the number pieces for each scenario: 1. The minimum number of pieces is 4. 2. The maximum number of pieces is 7.

The sum of the binomial coefficients in the expansion of a binomial expression is also obtained by substituting (a=1, b=1), which means (B = 2^{n}) as well. Given that (A+B=72), we have (2^{n} + 2^{n} = 72), which simplifies to (2 cdot 2^{n} = 72), and further to (2^{n+1} = 72). Solving this, we find (n+1 = 6), so (n = 5). The constant term in the expansion of ({left( sqrt{x}+ frac{3}{pi}right)}^{n} ) is obtained when the term involving (sqrt{x}) is raised to the power of 0, which occurs for the term (binom{n}{k} left( sqrt{x} right)^{0} left( frac{3}{pi} right)^{n}), where (k=0).

Let's calculate the probability of winning two consecutive games (P) based on the position of A, B, and C in the sequence of games: 1. **When A is played in the second game (P_{A}):** The chess player can win two consecutive games in the following scenarios: - Winning against B, then A, and losing to C, or winning against C, then A, and losing to B.

We can form the new sets as: [ {3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3} ] and distribute these elements among the existing sets to maintain the equal sum property. # Part 2: Proving the \\"only if\\" part Assume ( S ) can be partitioned into 3 pairwise disjoint subsets with the same number of elements and the same sum of their elements. We need to show that ( n ) must be a multiple of 3. 1. **Number of Elements in Each Subset:** Let each subset have ( m ) elements. Since there are 3 subsets, we have: [ 3m = n ] This implies ( n ) is a multiple of 3. 2. **Sum of Elements in Each Subset:** The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} i = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Each subset should have the same sum, so the sum of each subset is: [ frac{1}{3} cdot frac{n(n+1)}{2} = frac{n(n+1)}{6} ] For this to be an integer, ( n(n+1) ) must be divisible by 6. Since ( n ) and ( n+1 ) are consecutive integers, one of them is even, and one of them is divisible by 3. Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of 3.

Prove that there exists an infinite number of superabundant numbers.","completion":"1. **Theorem**: Let (a_n)_{n geq 1} be a sequence of positive real numbers. Call a term a_m, m geq 2, to be a *gigant* if a_m > a_k for all 1 leq k < m. Then, if there exists no largest element, there are infinitely many gigants. 2. **Proof of Theorem**: Assume a_N is the largest gigant. Since there exists no largest element, the set {m mid a_m > a_N} is non-empty. Let M be the least element of this set. Then a_M is a gigant because if a_k geq a_M for some 1 leq k < M, it would force a_k > a_N, thus N < k < M, contradicting the minimality of M. 3. To apply this theorem to our problem, we need to show that the sequence left(frac{sigma(n)}{n}right)_{n geq 1} has no largest element and is upper unbounded. Here, sigma(n) denotes the sum of the divisors of n. 4. Consider n = prod_{k=1}^s p_k, where p_k are distinct prime numbers. We have: [ frac{sigma(n)}{n} = prod_{k=1}^s left(1 + frac{1}{p_k}right) ] 5. Using the inequality prod_{k=1}^s left(1 + frac{1}{p_k}right) > 1 + sum_{k=1}^s frac{1}{p_k}, we observe that as s to infty, the sum sum_{k=1}^s frac{1}{p_k} diverges (since the harmonic series diverges). 6. Therefore, frac{sigma(n)}{n} to infty as s to infty. This implies that the sequence left(frac{sigma(n)}{n}right)_{n geq 1} is unbounded above and has no largest element. 7. By the theorem, since the sequence left(frac{sigma(n)}{n}right)_{n geq 1} has no largest element, there are infinitely many gigants in this sequence. 8. In the context of the problem, a gigant corresponds to a super-abundant number. Hence, there are infinitely many super-abundant numbers. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"An oil and gas extraction company set a task to revise its sales strategy for natural and liquefied gas during the winter season.

We need to find the length of side ( AB ). 1. **Identifying the Parallelogram Properties:** We know ( ABCD ) is a parallelogram, and thus, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, ( AB = DC ) and ( AD = BC ). 2. **Using the Angle Bisector:** The angle bisector of ( angle CAB ) intersects ( AD ) at point ( P ). According to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created by the angle bisector on one side equals the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides. 3. **Given Lengths:** We have: [ PD = 5, quad BP = 6, quad CP = 6. ] Since ( P ) lies on ( AD ), let ( AP = x ). 4. **Formulating the Problem with Similar Triangles:** By the properties of angle bisectors in a parallelogram: [ angle ABP = alpha quad text{and} quad angle BCP = alpha. ] Triangles ( triangle APB ) and ( triangle CPB ) are similar because they share (angle PBA ) and (angle PBC) being equal. 5. **Setting Up the Proportionality Using Similar Triangles:** Using the similarity: [ frac{AB}{BP} = frac{BP}{BC} ] Substituting the known values: [ frac{AB}{6} = frac{6}{BC} ] Since ( BC = AB ) (by the parallelogram property), let ( AB = x ): [ frac{x}{6} = frac{6}{x} ] Cross-multiplying gives: [ x^2 = 36 ] Solving for ( x ): [ x = sqrt{36} = 6. ] 6. **Alternative Case:** Another similar thought process considering the angle bisector hitting the extension of ( AD ) yields: [ AB = 9 ] This alternative approach similarly leads to solving a quadratic equation where the roots are checked for realistic side lengths. 7. **Conclusion:** Since the problem requires checking both cases, the possible lengths for ( AB ) are indeed 4 or 9.

If Helga worked an extra 2 hours last Thursday, and an extra 3 hours last Friday, how many articles was she able to write this week?","completion":"First, let's calculate how many articles Helga writes in her usual work schedule. Helga writes 5 articles every 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she can write 5 * 2 = 10 articles in an hour. She works 4 hours a day, so in a day, she writes 10 articles/hour * 4 hours/day = 40 articles/day. Since she works 5 days a week, in a usual week, she writes 40 articles/day * 5 days/week = 200 articles/week. Now let's calculate the extra articles she wrote due to the additional hours last Thursday and Friday. On Thursday, she worked an extra 2 hours, so she wrote an additional 10 articles/hour * 2 hours = 20 articles. On Friday, she worked an extra 3 hours, so she wrote an additional 10 articles/hour * 3 hours = 30 articles.

In other words, t(n) = k if n can be written as 2^k cdot m, where m is an odd integer and k is the highest such integer. 2. **Partition Definition**: We create the sets A_i for i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 99. Each set A_i is defined as: [ A_i = { n mid t(n) equiv i pmod{100} } ] Thus, each positive integer n is assigned to one of these sets based on the equivalence class of t(n) modulo 100. 3. **Analyze the Equation ( a + 99b = c )**: Suppose a + 99b = c and we need to see what the conditions on t(a), t(b), and t(c) should be. - If t(a) < t(b): Then t(99b) will typically be larger than t(a) because (99) will not change the highest power of 2 (since 99 = 2^0 cdot m, where m is odd). Hence, t(c) = t(a) because the smaller power of 2 in a will dominate the sum. - If t(a) > t(b): Then t(b) influences t(c), and so t(c) = t(b). - If t(a) = t(b): Regardless of whether a + 99b gives a new ( t(c) ), in this case, both a and b already share the same t value and are in the same set, ensuring at least two of a, b, c are in the same set. 4. **Ensuring ( a, b, c ) are not all in different sets**: By the observations above, if any of t(a) < t(b) or t(a) > t(b), then t(c) will match either t(a) or t(b). Therefore, at least two out of t(a), t(b), or t(c) are the same. This guarantees that not all three numbers (a, b, c) are placed in distinct sets due to the modulus condition in our partition. 5. **Conclusion**: By the definition of our sets and the properties analyzed, it is clear that the partition satisfies the required condition. Thus, it is possible to partition the positive integers into 100 non-empty sets such that if a + 99b = c for integers a, b, c, then a, b, c are not all in different sets.

This constraint applies individually to each of the 10 legs. 3. **Total Permutations Without Constraints:** If there were no constraints, the centipede could put on these 20 items in any order, which would give us 20! (20 factorial) possible permutations. 4. **Applying the Constraints:** For each leg, the sock must come before the shoe. The probability that for any given leg, the sock is put on before the shoe in a random arrangement of all 20 items is frac{1}{2}. This is because, for each pair (sock and shoe), there are 2 possible orders (sock-shoe or shoe-sock), and only one of them is correct. 5. **Probability for All Legs:** Since the legs are independent in terms of dressing, the probability that all legs have the sock put on before the shoe is left(frac{1}{2}right)^{10} = frac{1}{2^{10}}. 6. **Calculating the Number of Valid Permutations:** Given that each of the 20! permutations is equally likely, and the probability of a permutation being valid (socks before shoes for all legs) is frac{1}{2^{10}}, the number of valid permutations is: [ frac{20!}{2^{10}} ] Conclusion: The number of different orders in which the centipede can put on its socks and shoes, with the constraint that each sock must be put on before its corresponding shoe on each leg, is frac{20!{2^{10}}}.

Given the point P lies inside the regular hexagon with a side length of 1, we need to prove that the distances from P to some three vertices of the hexagon are not less than 1. 3. Consider triangle A_1OB. We can always position the point P this way for simplicity: inside the triangle A_1OB. 4. Hexagon properties: - Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120^circ. - The distance from the center O to any vertex (which is the radius of the circumscribed circle) is equal to the side length, which is 1. 5. Triangles and symmetry: - The hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. Because all sides of these triangles are equal (each side equals 1). 6. Since point P is inside triangle A_1OB, let's determine the distances from P to vertices A_3, A_4, and A_5 due to symmetry. 7. Distance calculation and symmetry arguments: - The line BO is perpendicular to opposite sides A_3A_4 and A_5A_6 of the hexagon. - This perpendicular distance is equal to the side length of the hexagon, which is 1. - Thus, any point on BO, inside the triangle A_1OB including point P, will be at a minimum distance of 1 from those sides. 8.

Given the inequality: [ 2log x + log(1-x) ge 3log y + log(y-1) ] we need to show that ( x^3 + y^3 < 2 ). 2. First, let's rewrite the given inequality in exponential form. Recall that (log a + log b = log(ab)): [ log(x^2) + log(1-x) ge log(y^3) + log(y-1) ] which simplifies to: [ log(x^2(1-x)) ge log(y^3(y-1)) ] 3. Since the logarithm function is monotonically increasing, we can remove the logarithms: [ x^2(1-x) ge y^3(y-1) ] 4. Now, we need to show that ( x^3 + y^3 < 2 ). Let's analyze the inequality ( x^2(1-x) ge y^3(y-1) ) further. 5. Consider the function ( f(x) = x^2(1-x) ). To find its maximum, we take the derivative and set it to zero: [ f'(x) = 2x(1-x) - x^2 = 2x - 3x^2 ] Setting ( f'(x) = 0 ): [ 2x - 3x^2 = 0 implies x(2 - 3x) = 0 implies x = 0 text{ or } x = frac{2}{3} ] 6.

Now consider the function ( g(y) = y^3(y-1) ). To find its minimum, we take the derivative and set it to zero: [ g'(y) = 3y^2(y-1) + y^3 = 4y^3 - 3y^2 ] Setting ( g'(y) = 0 ): [ y^2(4y - 3) = 0 implies y = 0 text{ or } y = frac{3}{4} ] 8.

Given ( x^2(1-x) ge y^3(y-1) ), and knowing the maximum and minimum values of these functions, we can infer that: [ frac{4}{27} ge -frac{27}{256} ] This inequality holds true, but it does not directly help us prove ( x^3 + y^3 < 2 ). 10. To proceed, we use the given inequality ( x^2 + y^3 ge x^3 + y^4 ). We need to show that ( x^3 + y^3 le 2 ). 11. From the inequality ( x^2 + y^3 ge x^3 + y^4 ), we can rearrange terms: [ x^2 - x^3 ge y^4 - y^3 ] 12. Since ( x < 1 ) and ( y > 1 ), we know ( x^2 - x^3 le x^2 ) and ( y^4 - y^3 ge y^3 ). Thus: [ x^2 ge y^3 ] 13. Using the fact that ( x^2 ge y^3 ), we can write: [ x^3 + y^3 le x^2 + y^3 le 2 ] 14. Therefore, we have shown that ( x^3 + y^3 le 2 ).

Let ( S_n = sum_{0 leq r leq frac{n}{2}} (-1)^r binom{n-r}{r} p^r q^r ). **1. Summation Bounds:** We note that if ( r > frac{n}{2} ), then ( n - r < r ), implying that the binomial coefficient ( binom{n-r}{r} = 0 ).

Part 2: Finding the Value of m Given that the two real roots of the equation satisfy x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{1}x_{2}=1, we use the relationships between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation. For an equation of the form ax^{2} + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{b}{a}, and the product of roots x_{1}x_{2} = frac{c}{a}. Applying these to our equation: 1. Sum of roots: x_{1} + x_{2} = 2m + 1 2. Product of roots: x_{1}x_{2} = -2 Given x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{1}x_{2} = 1, we substitute the expressions for the sum and product of roots: [ 2m + 1 - 2 = 1 ] Solving for m: [ 2m = 2 implies m = 1 ] Thus, the value of m that satisfies the given condition is boxed{m = 1}."},{"prompt":"The reality game show Survivor is played with 18 people divided into two tribes of 9 each.

This means we have: - Number of lamps on = 1 - Number of lamps off = 16 - 1 = 15 2. **Action Mechanism:** - Each row and each column has a switch that can change the state (from on to off or from off to on) of all the lamps in that row or column. 3. **Invariance of Parity upon Action:** - When a row or column switch is toggled, the parity of the number of lamps that are on (the number remaining even or odd) does not change. - Suppose the initial number of lamps that are on is odd (which is one in this case). - Toggling any row or column will flip the state of an even number of lamps (exactly four), which will maintain the odd parity (since adding or subtracting an even number to/from an odd number results in an odd number). 4. **Parity Analysis:** - Initial parity of the number of lamps on is odd (since 1 is odd). - Actions via switches do not change this parity: [ text{Odd} pm text{Even} = text{Odd} ] 5. **Conclusion:** - No matter how many switches are toggled or in what order, the number of lamps that are on will always have an odd parity. - Therefore, it is impossible to achieve a state where all 16 lamps are off, as turning off all the lamps would require the number of lamps on (which is zero) to be even.

Therefore, the number of edges in ( G ) is: [ |E(G)| = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - |E(overline{G})| ] Substituting the upper bound for ( |E(overline{G})| ): [ |E(G)| geq frac{n(n-1)}{2} - frac{(n-3)(n-1)}{2} ] Simplify the expression: [ |E(G)| geq frac{n(n-1) - (n-3)(n-1)}{2} ] [ |E(G)| geq frac{n(n-1) - (n^2 - 4n + 3)}{2} ] [ |E(G)| geq frac{n^2 - n - n^2 + 4n - 3}{2} ] [ |E(G)| geq frac{3n - 3}{2} ] [ |E(G)| geq frac{3(n-1)}{2} ] 5. **Verify the Sharpness of the Estimate:** The estimate is sharp, meaning there exists a configuration of the graph ( G ) for which this lower bound is attained. This can be verified by constructing specific examples or referring to the provided link for configurations.

How many feet does the squirrel travel?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the path of the squirrel as a helix around the cylindrical post. The squirrel makes one complete circuit around the post for every 4 feet of vertical rise. Since the post is 16 feet tall, the squirrel will make 16 / 4 = 4 complete circuits around the post. Each circuit around the post is equal to the circumference of the post, which is 2 feet. Therefore, in 4 circuits, the squirrel will travel a horizontal distance of 4 circuits * 2 feet/circuit = 8 feet. Now, we need to calculate the actual distance traveled by the squirrel, which is the length of the helical path. This can be done by considering the helical path as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the base is the horizontal distance traveled (8 feet) and the height is the vertical distance (16 feet). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the helix (hypotenuse) is given by: Length of helix = √(base^2 + height^2) Length of helix = √(8^2 + 16^2) Length of helix = √(64 + 256) Length of helix = √320 Length of helix ≈ 17.89 feet Therefore, the squirrel travels approximately boxed{17.89} feet along the spiral path up the post."},{"prompt":"w many digits do we need if we want to write down every integer from 1 to 10^{n}?","completion":"1. **Count the number of digits for different ranges of numbers:** a. **One-digit numbers**: These are the numbers from 1 to 9. - Number of one-digit numbers: 9 (i.e., ( 9 = 9 cdot 10^{0} )). b. **Two-digit numbers**: These are the numbers from 10 to 99. - Number of two-digit numbers: ( 99 - 9 = 90 ) (i.e., ( 90 = 9 cdot 10^{1} )). c. **Three-digit numbers**: These are the numbers from 100 to 999. - Number of three-digit numbers: ( 999 - 99 = 900 ) (i.e., ( 900 = 9 cdot 10^{2} )). d. **n-digit numbers**: Generally, these are the numbers from ( 10^{n-1} ) to ( 10^{n} - 1 ). - Number of n-digit numbers: ( 9 cdot 10^{n-1} ). 2. **Calculate the total number of digits required to write all these numbers:** The required number of digits ( S ) can be written as: [ begin{aligned} S & =1 cdot 9 cdot 10^{0} + 2 cdot 9 cdot 10^{1} + 3 cdot 9 cdot 10^{2} + ldots + n cdot 9 cdot 10^{n-1} & = 9 left(1 cdot 10^{0} + 2 cdot 10^{1} + 3 cdot 10^{2} + ldots + n cdot 10^{n-1} right) end{aligned} ] 3. **Simplify the summation inside the parentheses:** The expression inside the parentheses is: [ 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ldots + nx^{n-1} ] where ( x = 10 ).

Consequently, the mass of the second part would be: [ m - left( frac{m}{2} + x right) = frac{m}{2} - x ] 3. **Write the formula for the total price:** The total price of the two parts is calculated by summing the individual prices of the two pieces.

Given that f(x) + f(4-x) = 0, we can deduce that f(x) must be a periodic function with a period of 4, which implies that f(x) = f(x-4). This means the function repeats its values every 4 units along the x-axis. Now, let's evaluate f(0) considering the given condition: f(0) + f(4) = 0 Since f(x) is an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). It follows that f(0) = -f(4), but due to the odd nature of f, f(0) must be equal to 0 because the only number that is its own negative is 0. Next, let's find the value of f(2): f(2) + f(4-2) = f(2) + f(2) = 0 From this, we get that f(2) = 0.

By the pigeonhole principle, for large enough sets, some groupings will inherently have patterns due to controlled occurrences. - To ensure a perfect square, the exponents of each prime factor involved in the product must sum to an even number. 5. **Constructing Groups:** - We need to select four numbers such that the exponents for each ( p_j ) in their product sum to an even number. - By partitioning the 48 numbers and their exponent combinations in such a way, using established combinatorial principles (e.g., selecting combinations of even paired groups), it can be assured that an even sum is achieved for each prime divisor. 6. **Conclusion:** - Grouping four out of 48 numbers appropriately, leveraging the inherent principles of combinatorics and the pigeonhole principle, will allow even summation of exponents leading to the product being a perfect square. **Thus, the product of some four of these numbers is necessarily a perfect square.** [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Distribute 10 volunteer positions among 4 schools, with the requirement that each school receives at least one position.

Next, we find out how many geese survived the first month. Since 3/4 did not survive the first season, this means that 1/4 did survive the first season. So, if 525 geese are 1/4 of the geese that survived the first month, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of geese that survived the first month (M): 525 = (1/4) * M To solve for M, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 1/4, which is 4/1: M = 525 * 4 M = 2100 So, 2100 geese survived the first month. Now, we find out how many geese hatched from the eggs. Since 11/15 of the geese that hatched survived the first month, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of geese that hatched (H): 2100 = (11/15) * H To solve for H, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 11/15, which is 15/11: H = 2100 * (15/11) H = 2100 * (15/11) H = 2100 * 1.36363636...

C's work rate is 1 job per 12 days, so C's rate is 1/12 job per day. When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual rates: Combined rate = A's rate + B's rate + C's rate Combined rate = (1/6) + (1/8) + (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Rewrite the equation: [ x^2 - y^2 = m implies (x - y)(x + y) = m ] 3. This equation implies that ( x - y ) and ( x + y ) are products of some numbers from the set ( { p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n } ). 4. Therefore, each solution ( (x, y) ) corresponds to a partition of the set ( { p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n } ) into two subsets, where the product of elements in one subset is ( x - y ) and the product of elements in the other subset is ( x + y ). 5. There are ( 2^{n} ) ways to partition ( n ) elements into two non-empty subsets, but since we are looking for distinct pairs of products, we need to divide by 2, giving ( 2^{n-1} ) ways. To illustrate the bijective correspondence: 1. Each combination for ( (x-y) ) and ( (x+y) ) fulfilling the equation ( (x-y)(x+y) = m ) must consist of products of primes from ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n ). 2. We denote the product of elements in the set resulting in ( x-y ) as ( t ), and the product of elements in the set resulting in ( x+y ) as ( s ). 3. Clearly, ( t < s ) since ( x+y ) must be greater than ( x-y ) for natural ( x ) and ( y ). 4.

The integers ( x ) and ( y ) obtained this way are guaranteed to be natural numbers because ( s ) and ( t ) are products of odd primes, ensuring both ( s+t ) and ( s-t ) are even. 6.

The point (E) lies on the segment (AD) and the perimeters of ( triangle ABE, triangle BCE), and ( triangle CDE ) are equal. We need to prove that (BC = frac{AD}{2}). 1. **Identify Key Equalities and Parallelograms:** Since (BC parallel AD), we can use this property to analyze the relationship between the segments. Let's define a point (E_1) on the line (AD) such that (AE_1 parallel CB). Therefore, (AE_1CB) forms a parallelogram. 2. **Using Parallelogram Properties:** In the parallelogram (AE_1CB): - By the properties of parallelograms, we know that (AE_1 = BC) and (AB = CE_1). - In ( triangle ABE_1 ) and ( triangle BCE_1 ), the perimeters are given to be equal. Therefore, [ AB + BE_1 + AE_1 = BC + CE_1 + BE_1 ] Substituting ( AE_1 = BC ) and ( CE_1 = AB ), we get: [ AB + BE_1 + BC = BC + AB + BE_1 ] This is a valid equality as both sides are identical. 3. **Uniqueness of Point (E_1):** Next, we argue that (E_1) is the only point on (AD) where this equality holds true. Suppose we move (E) a distance (x) from (E_1): - (AE) changes by (x). - (CE) changes by less than or equal to (x), as (AE) directly affects (DE). Since the segments (AB) and (BC) are unchanged, the expressions (AB + BE) and (BC + CE) alter by different amounts as we shift the point (E). Thus, the perimeters of (triangle ABE_1) and (triangle BCE_1) are not equal for any (E) other than (E_1). 4. **Consider the Point (E_2):** Similarly, let (E_2) be the point on (AD) such that (BCDE_2) forms another parallelogram: - This implies (DE_2 = BC). - In (triangle BCE_2) and (triangle CDE_2), the perimeters are given to be equal. Repeating a similar argument as before: [ BC + CE_2 = CE_2 + DE_2 + CD - DC = BC + CD ] Hence, for this point (E_2), the perimeters are equal only when (E_2 = E_1). 5. **Conclusion:** Since both (E_1) and (E_2) refer to the same unique point (E), we see that (AE = DE) and thus: [ BC = AE = DE = frac{AD}{2} ] Conclusively, we have shown that: [ BC = frac{AD}{2} ] [ boxed{BC = frac{AD}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=|x5||x2|.

Recall the known property that the product of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers (a) and (b) is equal to the product of the numbers themselves: [ (a ; b) cdot [a ; b] = a cdot b ] Here, ((a ; b)) represents the GCD and ([a ; b]) represents the LCM of (a) and (b). 2. Let (d) denote the GCD of (a) and (b). According to the problem statement, the sum of the GCD and LCM is equal to (a + b): [ d + [a ; b] = a + b ] 3. Using the property mentioned in step 1, substitute ( [a ; b] ) with (frac{a cdot b}{d} ): [ d + frac{a cdot b}{d} = a + b ] 4. Clear the fraction by multiplying through by (d): [ d^2 + a cdot b = d(a + b) ] 5. Rearrange the equation: [ d^2 - (a + b)d + a cdot b = 0 ] 6. Notice that the equation can be factored: [ (d - a)(d - b) = 0 ] 7. Solve the factored equation: - If (d = a), then the GCD (d) is equal to (a), which implies (b) is a multiple of (a). - If (d = b), then the GCD (d) is equal to (b), which implies (a) is a multiple of (b).

Express (a) and (b) in terms of their GCD (d): [ a = d cdot ell quad text{and} quad b = d cdot k ] where (k) and (ell) are relatively prime (i.e., their GCD is 1). 2. Since the GCD of (a) and (b) is (d), and the LCM is (d cdot k cdot ell), the problem statement becomes: [ d + d cdot k cdot ell = a + b = d cdot ell + d cdot k ] 3. Simplify the equation by dividing all terms by (d) (noting that (d neq 0)): [ 1 + k cdot ell = ell + k ] 4. Rearrange the equation: [ k cdot ell - ell - k + 1 = 0 ] [ (k - 1)(ell - 1) = 0 ] 5. Solve the factored equation: - If (k - 1 = 0), then (k = 1). - If (ell - 1 = 0), then (ell = 1).

( b = a + 1992 ) Both numbers are positive integers. I. Why couldn't András determine ( b ) initially? - If ( a leq 1992 ), then ( b = a - 1992 ) would be negative or zero, which is not possible since ( b ) is a positive integer. Thus, it must be ( a > 1992 ) to make both ( a - 1992 ) and ( a + 1992 ) valid positive integers. Therefore, András couldn't determine ( b ) if ( a ) was more than 1992. II. Béla's reasoning process: - Knowing that ( a ) is greater than 1992, Béla tries to deduce further but couldn't determine ( a ). This implies that Béla's number ( b ) must be greater than ( 2 times 1992 = 3984 ). If ( b leq 3984 ), then ( a = b - 1992 leq 3984 - 1992 = 1992 ), which contradicts the initial conclusion that ( a > 1992 ). Hence, ( b ) must be greater than 3984 to keep ( a ) undetermined for both options ( a = b - 1992 ) and ( a = b + 1992 ). III. How András finally figured out ( b ): - Since Béla's number ( b ) is also greater than 3984, András must have deduced ( b = a + 1992 ). To further confirm: - Béla's statement left András with ( b > 3984 ), meaning ( a - 1992 ) too must be greater than 1992. - If ( a leq 5976 ), then ( b = a - 1992 leq 3984 ). This would make ( a )'s second deduction invalid. Therefore, ( a ) must be less than or equal to 5976 for András to conclusively determine ( b ). IV.

According to the midline theorem for trapezoids, the line connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (in this case, MN) is parallel to the bases AB and CD of the trapezoid. 3. Therefore, we have: [ MN parallel CD quad text{and} quad MN parallel AB ] 4. Since BN parallel DM, angle BCN = angle MND (alternate interior angles are equal when lines are parallel). 5. The triangles triangle BCN and triangle MND share the side MN, and have two sets of corresponding equal angles: - angle CNB = angle NDM - angle BCN = angle MND 6. By the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate, if two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. Therefore, triangle BCN cong triangle MND. 7. Given triangle BCN cong triangle MND, it follows that: [ MN = BC ] 8.

From the graph, we can see that the function y = d(t) takes its minimum value not at a single point, but at every point in the interval [6.5, 7]. **Conclusion for (a)**: The function d(t) does not attain its minimum value at a single point for any given set of numbers x_1, ldots, x_n. Therefore, the statement is not true. blacksquare **Part (b)** 1. Recall that c = frac{min_{i=1, ldots, n} x_i + max_{i=1, ldots, n} x_i}{2} and m is the median of the given set. 2. From the reasoning done in part (a), we infer that the function y = d(t) cannot increase to the left of the point c and cannot decrease to the right of this point. 3. Therefore, it is evident that d(c) is less than or equal to d(t) for any t, and in particular, it applies for t = m. 4. As a result, d(c) leq d(m). **Conclusion for (b)**: Comparing the values, we have d(c) leq d(m). boxed{}{d(c) leq d(m)}"},{"prompt":"Given 50 segments on a line. Prove that at least one of the following statements is true: There exist 8 of these segments that have a common point; There exist 8 of these segments such that no two of them intersect.","completion":": 1. The problem statement asks us to prove that among 50 line segments on a straight line, at least one of the following statements is true: - Some 8 of these segments have a common point. - Some 8 of these segments are pairwise non-intersecting. 2. Let's consider the theorem that applies in this context: Given a system of segments on a line, denote: - ( M ) as the minimum number of points on the line such that each segment contains at least one of these points. - ( m ) as the maximum number of pairwise non-intersecting segments that can be chosen from the system. The theorem states that ( M = m ). 3. Let's prove the theorem. It's clear that ( M geq m ) because if there are ( m ) pairwise non-intersecting segments, one cannot cover all segments of the system with fewer than ( m ) points. 4. To prove the reverse inequality ( M leq m ), consider the following: - We need to show that it's always possible to select a set of segments ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_k ) such that none of these segments intersect each other and in each of these segments, we can choose one point ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) such that every segment in the system contains one of these ( k ) points. 5. If we can find such ( k ) segments, then clearly ( M leq k ) and ( k leq m ), which implies ( M leq m ). This gives us ( M = m ). 6. Visualize the line segments on a horizontal straight line. Select the segment ( alpha_1 ) whose left endpoint ( A_1 ) is rightmost among all left endpoints of the segments. Remove all segments containing the point ( A_1 ), including ( alpha_1 ). 7. The remaining segments, if any, are entirely to the left of ( A_1 ) and do not intersect ( alpha_1 ). Apply the same procedure to the remaining segments to find ( alpha_2 ) and ( A_2 ), and so on until no segments are left. The segments ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_k ) and points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) satisfy our requirements. 8. With this theorem established, we can now solve the problem. 9. We need to prove that from ( pq+1 ) segments on a line, it is always possible to select either ( p+1 ) segments that have a common point, or ( q+1 ) pairwise non-intersecting segments. For our specific problem with ( p=q=7 ), we can choose either 8 segments with a common point or 8 pairwise non-intersecting segments. 10. Suppose for the given system of ( pq+1 ) segments, the value of ( M = m )—the quantity in the theorem—is greater than ( q ), then we can choose ( m geq q+1 ) pairwise non-intersecting segments. If this value is not greater than ( q ), then there is a set of ( M leq q ) points, each containing a segment from the system. Therefore, at least ( p+1 ) segments must share one of these points. If each point contained at most ( p ) segments, the total number would not exceed ( Mp leq pq ), which would be a contradiction because the total number of segments is ( pq+1 ). 11. Thus, we can conclude that either we can find 8 segments that have a common point or 8 pairwise non-intersecting segments. Finally, the conclusion is: [ boxed{text{Among the 50 segments, either some 8 have a common point or some 8 are pairwise non-intersecting.}}. ]"},{"prompt":"Solve for y: [arctan frac{1}{y} + arctan frac{1}{y^2} = frac{pi}{4}.]","completion":"From the given equation, [tan left( arctan frac{1}{y} + arctan frac{1}{y^2} right) = tan frac{pi}{4} = 1.] Using the tangent addition formula, we have: [frac{frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{y^2}}{1 - frac{1}{y} cdot frac{1}{y^2}} = 1,] which simplifies to: [frac{y + 1}{y^2 - 1} = 1.] Thus, rearranging gives: [y^2 - 1 = y + 1,] or: [y^2 - y - 2 = 0.] Factoring the quadratic polynomial, we get: [(y-2)(y+1) = 0.] So, y = 2 or y = -1.

To further confirm this, let's show an arrangement of 16 dominos: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_50551174acfc6b9a623bg-2.jpg?height=317&width=309&top_left_y=1020&top_left_x=2031) 6. Ensuring maximal placement within this constraint, it becomes clear that more than 16 dominos would either overlap or exceed the counted grid area available for dominos. 7. The proof hinges on the constraint that each domino must involve at least one marked cell, and we only have 16 such cells. Hence, the answer is robust as it fundamentally respects the areas required by each dominos. Therefore, the maximum number of dominos that can be placed on the given board is: [ boxed{16} ] Conclusively, we reach our final answer with logical and visual proof combined.

Since z, z^2, z^3 form a square (as given), the fourth vertex formed by these three points in a square should be z^4.

According to the given conditions, we have the following system of equations: 1. From the line l: y = x - 1, we get b = a - 1. 2. From the line y = -2x + 8, we get b = -2a + 8.

A full circle is 360 degrees, and if salaries are represented by 234 degrees, we can calculate the percentage of the budget spent on salaries by dividing the angle for salaries by the total angle of the circle and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Percentage for salaries = (234 degrees / 360 degrees) * 100 Percentage for salaries = 0.65 * 100 Percentage for salaries = 65% Now we know that 65% of the budget was spent on salaries.

Then, the sum of the angles formed by the line ( OP ) and the edges ( PA, PB, PC ) is less than the sum of the face angles at vertex ( P ). **Proof of Lemma:** We will use the duality between trihedral angles and spherical triangles. First, note that it suffices to assume that ( PO ) is an interior ray of a trihedral angle whose edges are the rays ( PA, PB, PC ). With ( alpha, beta, gamma ) denoting the angles ( BPC, CPA, APB ) respectively, and ( x, y, z ) the angles ( OPA, OPB, OPC ) respectively, we want to prove that ( x + y + z < alpha + beta + gamma ). Draw a unit sphere centered at ( P ), intersecting the ray ( PO ) at ( O' ). The points ( A', B', C' ) are defined in a similar way. Clearly, the angle ( OPB ) is equal to the angle ( O'PB' ), and we have similar equalities for the other angles. Now, the intersection of the sphere with the trihedral angle is a spherical triangle ( A'B'C' ) which can be triangulated by great circle arcs meeting at ( O' ). If all the face angles of the trihedral angles are measured in radians, then (the radius of the sphere being unity) the lengths of all connecting arcs are: [ text{arc } B'C' = alpha, quad text{arc } C'A' = beta, quad text{arc } A'B' = gamma, ] [ text{arc } O'A' = x, quad text{arc } O'B' = y, quad text{arc } O'C' = z. ] Let arc ( O'B' ) and arc ( A'C' ) meet at ( B'' ). Since all the spherical triangles we are concerned with here are convex, we have: [ text{arc } O'B'' + text{arc } B'C' > z quad text{and} quad gamma + text{arc } A'B'' > y + text{arc } O'B''. ] Adding these two inequalities, we obtain: [ beta + gamma > y + z. ] We deduce similar inequalities for the other angles. Summing leads to the desired result: [ x + y + z < alpha + beta + gamma. ] 2. **Returning to the original problem:** Let ( ABCD ) be the tetrahedron and ( P ) the interior point. Let ( A' ) be the intersection of line ( AP ) with face ( BCD ). Let ( S ) be the sum of the angles ( APB, APC, ) and ( APD ). Let ( S' ) be the sum of the angles ( BPC, CPD, ) and ( DPB ). Let ( S'' ) be the sum of the angles ( A'PB, A'PC, ) and ( A'PD ). Clearly, ( S + S'' = 3pi ) and, using the lemma, we have ( S' > S'' ). Thus: [ S + S' > 3pi, ] and we are done.

Therefore, if we repeatedly replace two numbers with their difference, the parity of the sum of all numbers on the tableau remains unchanged. 3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: - We initially have integers from 1 to 2011. - The sum of these integers is given by the formula for the sum of the first n integers: [ S = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Setting (n = 2011), we get: [ S = frac{2011 times 2012}{2} = frac{2011 times 2012}{2} ] Since (2012 = 2 times 1006), the sum simplifies to: [ S = 2011 times 1006 ] 4. **Parity of the Initial Sum**: The product of an odd number (2011) and an even number (1006) is even. Thus, the initial sum (S) is even. 5. **Invariant Verification**: Given the sum remains even throughout the process (due to parity preservation), the final integer, being the sole survivor of the iterative process, should also be even. 6. **Conclusion**: Since 1 is an odd number, it is impossible for the last integer obtained to be 1. Therefore, the final integer obtained after repeatedly replacing two integers with their difference cannot be 1.

Step 1: Recognize that odd functions are symmetric with respect to the origin. This means if f(x) is odd, then f(-x) = -f(x). Step 2: Understand that the minimum positive period of a function is the smallest positive value, T, for which f(x + T) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f. Given that the minimum positive period is frac{pi}{2}, we are looking for a trigonometric function that repeats its values every frac{pi}{2} units. Step 3: Among the basic trigonometric functions, sin x and cos x have periods of 2pi, and their multiples can have shorter periods. To satisfy the odd function property and have a period of frac{pi}{2}, we consider the sine function, which is inherently odd (sin(-x) = -sin(x)). Step 4: To adjust the period of the sine function to frac{pi}{2}, we use the formula for the period of sin bx, which is frac{2pi}{|b|}. Setting this equal to frac{pi}{2} and solving for b gives us frac{2pi}{|b|} = frac{pi}{2} Rightarrow |b| = 4. Therefore, b = 4 since b must be positive to maintain the minimum positive period.

Notice that the denominator can be rewritten using the binomial theorem: [ 5x^4 - 10x^3 + 10x^2 - 5x + 1 = (x-1)^5 + 1 ] Therefore, the function becomes: [ f(x) = frac{x^5}{x^5 + (1-x)^5} ] 3. Next, observe the symmetry property of the function: [ f(x) + f(1-x) = frac{x^5}{x^5 + (1-x)^5} + frac{(1-x)^5}{x^5 + (1-x)^5} = 1 ] This is because the sum of the numerators is equal to the denominator. 4. Using this property, we can pair the terms in the sum ( sum_{i=1}^{2009} fleft( frac{i}{2009} right) ). For each ( i ) from 1 to 2009, there is a corresponding term ( fleft( frac{2009-i}{2009} right) ) such that: [ fleft( frac{i}{2009} right) + fleft( frac{2009-i}{2009} right) = 1 ] 5.

This is due to the definition of S(i, j) as an average. 3. **Constructing segments:** Consider the segment [1, n].

The length of the platform is 38.0952380952381 meters. How long does it take for the train to cross the platform?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the train first. When the train crosses a signal pole, it only has to cover its own length because the signal pole is effectively a point compared to the length of the train. The time taken to cross the signal pole is given as 42 seconds, and the length of the train is 200 meters. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: Speed (v) = Distance / Time Substituting the given values: v = 200 meters / 42 seconds v = 4.76190476190476 meters/second (approximately) Now, when the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. The length of the platform is given as 38.0952380952381 meters. The total distance (D) the train has to cover to cross the platform is: D = Length of the train + Length of the platform D = 200 meters + 38.0952380952381 meters D = 238.0952380952381 meters Using the speed we calculated earlier, we can now find the time (T) it takes for the train to cross the platform: Time (T) = Distance (D) / Speed (v) Substituting the values: T = 238.0952380952381 meters / 4.76190476190476 meters/second T = 50 seconds (approximately) Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{50} seconds for the train to cross the platform."},{"prompt":"Compute without using a calculator: 9! 8!.","completion":"[ 9! - 8! = 9 times 8! - 8! = 8!(9 - 1) = 8! times 8 ] Next, we compute 8!: [ 8! = 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 40320 ] So, [ 8! times 8 = 40320 times 8 = boxed{322,!560} ]"},{"prompt":"John takes 3 naps a week.

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us a_1 + 2d + a_1 + 8d = 2d. Combining like terms results in 2a_1 + 10d = 2d.

Since Thomas is buying 18 ingots, he will get the discount. Let's find out the discounted price he pays for the ingots. The total cost without the discount for the 18 ingots is 72. To find the original price before the discount, we need to divide the total cost by the discounted percentage. Let's denote the original price of one ingot as P. Since Thomas gets a 20% discount for buying more than 10 ingots, the price he pays after the discount is 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%). So, the equation for the total cost with the discount is: 18 ingots * P * 80% = 72 Now we need to find P: 18P * 0.8 = 72 18P = 72 / 0.8 18P = 90 Now, we divide both sides by 18 to find the price per ingot: P = 90 / 18 P = 5 Therefore, the cost of each steel ingot before the discount is boxed{5} ."},{"prompt":"When positive integer x is divided by 10, the quotient is y and the remainder is 3.

Let us denote the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal of the table before any shifts as ( s_0 ). For any ( k )-th cyclic shift, the sum of the diagonal numbers after ( k ) shifts will be denoted as ( s_k ). 2. **Cyclic Shifts and the Sum of All Elements:** Notice that each cyclic shift of the table simply rearranges the elements without changing the overall sum. Hence, if we perform a cyclic shift for ( k ) times where ( k ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ), each number in the original table appears exactly once on the diagonal in one of the shifts. 3. **Summation Over All Cyclic Shifts:** The total sum of all ( s_k ) values from ( k = 0 ) to ( n-1 ) is the sum of all the numbers in the ( n times n ) table: [ s_0 + s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_{n-1} ] This total sum is equal to the sum of all the numbers in the table since each element contributes to exactly one of the diagonal sums in this summation. 4. **Non-Negativity Condition:** By the problem statement, the sum of all the elements in the table is non-negative: [ s_0 + s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_{n-1} geq 0 ] 5. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** Since we have ( n ) sums ( s_0, s_1, ldots, s_{n-1} ) and their total is non-negative, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these sums must be non-negative: [ exists k , text{ such that } , s_k geq 0 ] 6. **Conclusion:** By performing ( k ) cyclic shifts where ( k ) corresponds to one of the non-negative sums, the sum of the ( n ) numbers on the diagonal after this shift is non-negative.

Since D(A) has at most 1 + frac{1}{2} |A| (|A| - 1) elements, the set of possible non-zero, distinct ratios between elements in D(A) must be at most polynomial in size relative to |A|. Thus, the cardinality of Q(A) can be bounded by one-half of the fourth power of |A|: [ |Q(A)| leq frac{1}{2} |A|^4 ] 4. **Optimizing lambda:** We need to construct an example to show that a smaller lambda wouldn't work. Consider the construction a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_n in A such that a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, and construct A_i = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_i } for all i. Assume A_{k-1} is already constructed with 2 < k leq n.

By constructing a_k, we avoid repetitions and keep all differences distinct. 6. **Conclusion on lambda:** The previous steps show that: [ D(A) leq 1 + frac{1}{2} |A| (|A|-1) ] Implies combination for Q(A) yields: [ |Q(A)| = frac{1}{2} |A|^4 ] Therefore, the smallest lambda ensuring the inequality holds for any set A is: [ boxed{frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"As shown in Figure 4, two chords ( AB ) and ( CD ) of a circle intersect at point ( E ).

Consider the given trapezoid (ABCD) with diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersecting at point (M), and lines (AD) and (BC) intersecting at point (K). 2. To prove that the line (KM) passes through the midpoints (H) of side (AB) and (P) of side (CD), we need to use symmetry properties and similarity of triangles. 3. Observe triangle (AKB). Notice that triangle (AKB) is similar to a right isosceles triangle (A_1K_1B_1) due to the alignment and intersection properties. Likewise, the entire trapezoid (ABCD) can be mapped as a reflection of an isosceles trapezoid (A_1B_1C_1D_1). 4. In this setup, we know the following: - Line (AD) is parallel to line (BC). - Diagonal (BD) intersects diagonal (AC) at point (M), which is the point of intersection of the diagonals within the trapezoid. 5. Consider now an isosceles trapezoid (A_1B_1C_1D_1 ). In such a trapezoid, the line that passes through the intersection of the diagonals ((M_1)) and the intersection of the non-parallel sides ((K_1)) is the axis of symmetry. Therefore, this line also bisects the segments (D_1C_1) and (A_1B_1). 6. The points (H) (midpoint of (AB)) and (P) (midpoint of (CD)) in trapezoid (ABCD) are the images of the points (H_1) and (P_1), midpoints of (A_1B_1) and (C_1D_1), respectively. 7. Since (K_1M_1) is the axis of symmetry for trapezoid (A_1B_1C_1D_1), it passes through the midpoints (H_1) and (P_1). 8. Consequently, by symmetry and the similarity of the triangles and trapezoids considered, the line (KM) for trapezoid (ABCD) will also pass through the midpoints (H) of (AB) and (P) of (CD). 9. Hence, we have demonstrated that the line (KM) bisects both segments (AB) and (CD) through their respective midpoints (H) and (P).

They bought six one day passes to a tourist attraction for 28 per ticket. They have 83 left. How much money did Olivia have initially?","completion":"To find out how much money Olivia had initially, we first need to calculate the total cost of the six one-day passes to the tourist attraction.

We also know that Nigel had 139 initially. Let's find out the total amount of money they had before buying the tickets by adding the cost of the tickets to the remaining money: Total cost of tickets + Remaining money = Total initial money 168 + 83 = 251 Now, we know that the total initial money they had together was 251. Since Nigel had 139 of that total, we can find out how much Olivia had initially by subtracting Nigel's amount from the total initial money: Total initial money - Nigel's money = Olivia's initial money 251 - 139 = 112 Therefore, Olivia had boxed{112} initially."},{"prompt":"After spending Rs. 5000 on rent, Rs. 1500 on milk, Rs. 4500 on groceries, Rs. 2500 on children's education, Rs. 2000 on petrol and Rs. 700 on miscellaneous expenses, Mr. Kishore saved 10% of his monthly salary.

Now we can set up the equation: 16200 + 0.10S = S To find the savings, we need to solve for S: 0.10S = S - 16200 Now, let's subtract S from both sides to isolate the savings on one side: 0.10S - S = -16200 This simplifies to: -0.90S = -16200 Now, divide both sides by -0.90 to solve for S: S = -16200 / -0.90 S = 18000 So, Mr. Kishore's monthly salary is Rs. 18000.

We need to find the positive integer solution for k. To solve for k, we can use the quadratic formula: k = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a) In this equation, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -7310. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get: k = (-1 ± √(1 + 4 * 7310)) / 2 k = (-1 ± √(29241)) / 2 Since k must be a positive integer, we take the positive square root: k = (-1 + √29241) / 2 Now we calculate the square root of 29241: √29241 ≈ 171 So we have: k = (-1 + 171) / 2 k = 170 / 2 k = 85 Since k represents the number of even numbers between 1 and n, and the largest even number less than n is n-1, we have: n - 1 = 2k n - 1 = 2 * 85 n - 1 = 170 n = 171 Therefore, the value of n is boxed{171} ."},{"prompt":"f 5^{3y} = 625, what is the value of 5^{3y2}?","completion":"Firstly, we recognize that 5^{3y-2} can be expressed as 5^{3y}cdot 5^{-2}.

Converting this to rectangular coordinates, we obtain x^2+y^2=4x. Completing the square, the equation of curve C is (x-2)^2+y^2=4. For line l, we first find its slope by differentiating the parametric equations: frac{dy}{dx}=frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}=frac{sqrt{2}/2}{sqrt{2}/2}=1.

Since P must lie on the line given by the first equation, let's check that our point P satisfies this equation: 2 - 1 - 7 = -6 neq 0 The calculated point does not satisfy the equation of line l. It appears that there has been a mistake in the calculation or interpretation of the midpoint or the line equation. The correct approach would require us to use the correct coordinates for Q and subsequently check each option to see which one yields the correct midpoint. Let's rectify this. 1. For option A: Let's suppose P = (6, 1) and find Q: left( frac{6 + x_Q}{2}, frac{1 + y_Q}{2} right) = (1, -1) This yields Q = (-4, -3). Now let's check if Q lies on the line x - y - 7 = 0: -4 - (-3) - 7 = 0 quad text{which simplifies to} quad -4 + 3 - 7 = -8 neq 0 So option A does not satisfy the condition. 2. For option B: Let's suppose P = (-2, 1) and find Q: left( frac{-2 + x_Q}{2}, frac{1 + y_Q}{2} right) = (1, -1) This yields Q = (4, -3). Now let's check if Q lies on the line x - y - 7 = 0: 4 - (-3) - 7 = 0 quad text{which simplifies to} quad 4 + 3 - 7 = 0 This correct, meaning option B satisfies the condition.

We need to prove that the center of the circumcircle of (triangle NAM) lies on the diagonal (AC). 2. **Noting the Properties of Rhombus**: Recall that all sides of a rhombus are equal. Therefore, let (AB = BC = CD = DA = a). Also, diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. 3. **Internal and External Angles**: - Since (angle A = 120^circ), (angle B = angle D = 60^circ) because opposite angles of a rhombus are equal. - Point (M) is on (BC) and point (N) is on (CD). 4. **Properties of Angles in a Rhombus**: - Let the intersection of diagonals (AC) and (BD) be point (O), the center of the rhombus. 5. **Rotation and Bisecting Properties**: - Rotate the rhombus around point (M) by (60^circ). During this rotation, ray (CD) transitions to the position of ray (CA). - (M) lies on the bisector of the external angle of (angle C) at ( triangle ACD ), making it equidistant from lines (AD) and (DC). 6. **Determining Point (N) and Angle (angle NAM) at (30^circ)**: - The points (M) and (N) with the given conditions must align such that (angle NAM = 30^circ). 7. **Key Angle and Location**: - Because point (O) must lie at (30^circ) to fit within the rhombus’ constraints, it must also lie on one of its diagonals. - Specifically, with (angle A = 120^circ) and knowing ( triangle MON ) forms an equilateral triangle from the rotation, point (O) must lie along diagonal (AC). 8. **Conclusion**: By consistent angle properties and rotation properties, the center of the circumcircle of (triangle NAM) must lie on the diagonal (AC) of the rhombus (ABCD).

Let there be ( k ) line segments emanating from ( A_1 ), designated as ( A_1B_1, A_1B_2, ldots, A_1B_k ). 2. **Non-Existence of Triangles**: Since no triangles with the segments as edges are allowed, it follows that any pair of points ( B_i, B_j ) (with ( i neq j ) and ( 1 leq i, j leq k )) are not directly connected by a line segment. Hence, among the points ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ), there are no direct line segments between any two of them. 3. **Connections to Other Points**: Each point ( B_i ) (for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k )) can have line segments to at most ( n - k ) other points (excluding ( A_1 ) and the ( k ) other points ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k )). 4. **Remaining Points**: Consider the remaining ( n-k-1 ) points ( A_2, A_3, ldots, A_{n-k} ) which are neither ( A_1 ) nor any of the ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ).

When ( k = 0 ), these formulas simplify to: - For a discrete random variable with finite support: [ v_0 = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^0 p_i = sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 1 ] - For a discrete random variable with infinite support: [ v_0 = sum_{i=1}^{infty} x_i^0 p_i = sum_{i=1}^{infty} p_i = 1 ] - For a continuous random variable: [ v_0 = int_{-infty}^{+infty} x^0 p(x) , dx = int_{-infty}^{+infty} p(x) , dx = 1 ] 2. These equalities are derived considering the normalization condition of probability distributions. Specifically, the sum of probabilities for discrete cases and the integral of the probability density function for continuous cases must equal 1. 3. Thus, the initial moment of zero order for a random variable X is 1. 4. When ( k = 1 ), the initial moments are obtained as follows: - For a discrete random variable with finite support: [ v_1 = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i p_i = mathbb{E}[X] ] - For a discrete random variable with infinite support: [ v_1 = sum_{i=1}^{infty} x_i p_i = mathbb{E}[X] ] - For a continuous random variable: [ v_1 = int_{-infty}^{+infty} x p(x) , dx = mathbb{E}[X] ] 5.

Let p(x) = h'(x) = frac{1}{x+1} - e^x. 2. **Second Derivative of p(x):** Then, p'(x) = -frac{1}{(x+1)^2} - e^x. Since p'(x) < 0 for all x in (-1, +infty), p(x) is monotonically decreasing on this interval. 3. **Behavior of p(x) and h(x):** - At x=0, p(0) = 0. - For x in (-1, 0), p(x) > 0, implying h'(x) > 0. Thus, h(x) is increasing on (-1, 0). - For x in (0, +infty), p(x) < 0, implying h'(x) < 0.
