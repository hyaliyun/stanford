Стандартно, первый черновик сценария может занять от нескольких недель до нескольких месяцев работы. Однако реальное время может значительно отличаться. Некоторые сценаристы могут написать черновой вариант за несколько дней в состоянии творческого вдохновения, в то время как другим требуется год или более, чтобы доработать свою историю до конца. После того как первый черновик завершен, обычно следует несколько раундов пересмотра и редактирования. Это может включать в себя работу с редакторами, продюсерами, режиссерами и иногда актерами, чтобы улучшить диалоги и развитие сюжета. Этот процесс тоже может занимать от нескольких месяцев до нескольких лет. Кроме того, много времени уходит на предпродажную подготовку, в течение которой сценаристы могут искать агента, продавать сценарий студиям или искать инвесторов для инди-проектов. Эта стадия также может значительно увеличить общее время, затраченное на проект. Очень важно понимать, что процесс написания сценария очень индивидуален и не подчиняется жестким временным рамкам."},{"prompt":"Что значит первый черновик сценария?","completion":"Первый черновик сценария (иногда называемый \\"первым наброском\\" или на английский манер \\"first draft\\") представляет собой начальную версию сценария, которая отражает основную структуру истории, ключевые события, персонажей и их диалоги. Это первая полноценная реализация идеи в виде документа, который можно читать, оценивать и обсуждать. Первый черновик часто является результатом длительного процесса, включая разработку сюжета, создание персонажей, конструирование сцен и секвенций, и он является основой для всех будущих редакторских правок и доработок. Не стоит ожидать, что он будет идеальным или готовым к производству. Авторы используют первый черновик для выражения основной концепции истории и для выявления её сильных и слабых мест. В процессе перехода от первого черновика к окончательной версии сценария сценаристы проводят многочисленные пересмотры и редактирования. В них могут быть внесены изменения в сюжет, переписываются диалоги, улучшается характеристика персонажей, а также изменяется общая структура истории для улучшения её развития, глубины и эмоционального воздействия на зрителя. Опытные сценаристы и киноиндустрия в целом осознают, что первый черновик — это только начало пути и что работа над сценарием будет продолжаться до самого начала производства фильма, и иногда даже после его начала, вплоть до завершения съемочного процесса."},{"prompt":"Даже если сценарий примут крупные студии как Universal pictures, то сколько времени будет идти на разработку фильма, а также редактирование сценария?","completion":"Разработка фильма после того, как сценарий принят крупной студией вроде Universal Pictures, может быть длительным процессом, который зависит от множества переменных. Время на разработку и редактирование сценария может варьироваться от нескольких месяцев до нескольких лет. Вот основные этапы, которые могут повлиять на продолжительность процесса разработки фильма: 1. Пересмотр сценария: Даже если сценарий принят студией, он обычно проходит через несколько этапов редактирования. Студия может назначить сценаристам работать над переписыванием сценария на основе обратной связи от руководителей студии, продюсеров, потенциального режиссера и других ключевых фигур. Это может включать изменения в сюжете, персонажах, диалогах, тоне и структуре и может требовать несколько черновиков. 2. Разработка проекта: В стадии разработки решается множество вопросов, таких как финансирование, бюджеты, маркетинговые стратегии, привлечение режиссера, подбор ключевых исполнителей и оперативной группы (например, директора по кастингу, директора фотографии). 3. Предварительное производство: На этом этапе все подробности фильма прорабатываются еще глубже. Определяется окончательный состав актеров, команда производителей утверждает концептуальные и визуальные аспекты (например, дизайн продукции, костюмы), разрабатывается график съемок и обсуждаются локации. 4. Производство: Наконец, начинается съемочный процесс. В это время сценарий может продолжать эволюционировать, особенно если возникают проблемы на месте, требуются изменения диалогов или действий, обусловленные особенностями съемочной площадки или решениями режиссера. Оценить точное время разработки фильма сложно, поскольку оно зависит от сложности проекта, графиков участников, бюджетных ограничений и других производственных факторов. Некоторые проекты могут перейти от идеи к завершению в пределах одного-двух лет, в то время как другие могут тянуться годами, иногда даже замирая на неопределенное время на любом из этапов разработки. Кроме того, студийные фильмы обычно имеют более сложные процедуры одобрения и контроля качества, что также прибавляет времени к общему процессу разработки."},{"prompt":"Например в фильме начало сколько времени потребовалось на разработку?","completion":"Фильм \\"Начало\\" (Inception), написанный и режиссируемый Кристофером Ноланом, является примером проекта, на разработку которого ушло довольно много времени. Нолан начал работу над идеей \\"Начала\\", фильма о крадущих сны, ещё в 2001 году, когда он написал 80-страничное описание для фильма, который первоначально задумывался как небольшой проект. За несколько лет, работая над другими фильмами, в том числе \\"Помни\\" (2000), \\"Бэтмен: Начало\\" (2005) и \\"Темный рыцарь\\" (2008), Нолан продолжил раздумывать над концепцией \\"Начала\\". Он постепенно развивал историю, опираясь на свои исследования по психологии снов и архитектуре сознания. Околчательный сценарий \\"Начала\\" Кристофер Нолан закончил уже после успеха \\"Темного рыцаря\\", и производство фильма началось в 2009 году. Полученные после \\"Темного рыцаря\\" кассовые успехи и критическое признание дали Нолану значительную творческую свободу и возможность обеспечить достаточное финансирование для достижения его амбициозного видения в \\"Начале\\". Фильм был выпущен в 2010 году, так что можно сказать, что концепция и разработка \\"Начала\\" от начальной идеи до окончательного релиза в кинотеатрах заняла примерно десять лет. Но сам интенсивный период написания окончательного сценария и производства фильма пришелся на период после 2008 года. Этот пример показывает, что творческий процесс в кинематографе часто непредсказуем и может растягиваться на долгие годы, особенно когда речь идет о сложных, оригинальных проектах, требующих глубокой проработки концепции и логистики."},{"prompt":"Я думаю переписывать сценарий студиям в разы быстрее чем создать его","completion":"Да, это часто бывает правдой. Переписать существующий сценарий, как правило, занимает меньше времени, чем создать его с нуля, поскольку основная структура истории и характер персонажей уже определены. Переписывание фокусируется обычно на улучшении деталей сюжета, развитии персонажей, усилении диалогов и исправлении любых несоответствий или проблем в истории, которые были обнаружены в процессе предварительной работы над проектом. Тем не менее, степень и объем необходимых изменений могут сильно варьироваться от проекта к проекту. Некоторые редакции сценария могут быть довольно поверхностными и занимать относительно немного времени, тогда как другие требуют глубоких изменений, которые могут быть почти так же сложными и времязатратными, как создание оригинального сценария. Кроме того, редактирование сценария часто является итеративным процессом с множеством раундов обратной связи и изменений. Продюсеры, режиссеры и студии могут иметь свои предложения для изменений, которые иногда могут существенно изменять направление и элементы сценария. Еще одна причина, по которой переписывание может быть относительно быстрым, заключается в том, что студии и другие участники процесса обычно имеют строгие сроки и бюджет, которые необходимо соблюдать, что служит стимулом для быстрых изменений. В целом, время, необходимое для переписки сценария, зависит от множества факторов, включая объем требуемых изменений, доступность ключевых лиц проекта для принятия решений и пересмотра, и общего графика производства фильма."},{"prompt":"What is generative ai","completion":"Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence that specializes in creating new content, ranging from text, images, and audio to complex data patterns. This type of AI learns from large datasets to generate original outputs that can resemble, elaborate on, or improve upon the inputs it has been trained on. There are various methods and technologies within the scope of generative AI, with some of the most notable being: 1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—competing against each other. The generator tries to create realistic data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between the generated data and real data. This process continues until the generator produces outputs that the discriminator can no longer differentiate from actual data. 2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These are a type of autoencoder neural network that learns to compress data into an encoded representation, but with additional constraints, which encourage the model to learn latent variables that capture salient characteristics of the data. These variables can then be used to generate new instances that are similar to the input data. 3. **Transformer models:** These models, such as OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) series and Google's BERT, are designed to handle sequential data and have been very successful in generating natural language texts. They use self-attention mechanisms to consider the context from the entire text input, which enables them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. 4. **Diffusion models:** These are a newer class of generative models which turn noise into structured data, typically images, by gradually refining the signal. They work by initially corrupting a data sample with Gaussian noise and then learning to reverse this corruption process. Generative AI can be applied to a wide array of tasks, including but not limited to: - **Art:** AI can generate paintings, music, and other forms of art, often in the style of human artists or with unique styles of its own creation. - **Design:** AI can assist with architectural designs, fashion, and product development. - **Synthetic data generation:** It can be used to create data that can then be used to train other AI models, particularly in cases where real data is scarce or sensitive. - **Deepfakes:** Realistic images, videos, or audio recordings of people saying or doing things they never did, although this also raises ethical concerns. - **Text generation:** AI can write creative fiction, generate news articles, compose poetry, or even simulate conversation in chatbots. As generative AI continues to evolve, the potential applications are vast and could be highly disruptive to many creative industries, while also offering new tools for innovation and content creation. However, the technology also raises important concerns regarding authenticity, intellectual property, and the possibility of misuse, which society is actively working to address."},{"prompt":"Переделай файл так что бы раздел \\"Выпадающий список\\" открывался при наведение и напиши что ты сделал: <nav class=\\"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light\\"> <div class=\\"container-fluid\\"> <a class=\\"navbar-brand\\" href=\\"#\\">Панель навигации</a> <button class=\\"navbar-toggler\\" type=\\"button\\" data-bs-toggle=\\"collapse\\" data-bs-target=\\"#navbarSupportedContent\\" aria-controls=\\"navbarSupportedContent\\" aria-expanded=\\"false\\" aria-label=\\"Переключатель навигации\\"> <span class=\\"navbar-toggler-icon\\"></span> </button> <div class=\\"collapse navbar-collapse\\" id=\\"navbarSupportedContent\\"> <ul class=\\"navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0\\"> <li class=\\"nav-item\\"> <a class=\\"nav-link active\\" aria-current=\\"page\\" href=\\"#\\">Главная</a> </li> <li class=\\"nav-item\\"> <a class=\\"nav-link\\" href=\\"#\\">Ссылка</a> </li> <li class=\\"nav-item dropdown\\"> <a class=\\"nav-link dropdown-toggle\\" href=\\"#\\" id=\\"navbarDropdown\\" role=\\"button\\" data-bs-toggle=\\"dropdown\\" aria-expanded=\\"false\\"> Выпадающий список </a> <ul class=\\"dropdown-menu\\" aria-labelledby=\\"navbarDropdown\\"> <li><a class=\\"dropdown-item\\" href=\\"#\\">Действие</a></li> <li><a class=\\"dropdown-item\\" href=\\"#\\">Другое действие</a></li> <li><hr class=\\"dropdown-divider\\"></li> <li><a class=\\"dropdown-item\\" href=\\"#\\">Что-то еще здесь</a></li> </ul> </li> <li class=\\"nav-item\\"> <a class=\\"nav-link disabled\\" href=\\"#\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\" aria-disabled=\\"true\\">Отключенная</a> </li> </ul> <form class=\\"d-flex\\"> <input class=\\"form-control me-2\\" type=\\"search\\" placeholder=\\"Поиск\\" aria-label=\\"Поиск\\"> <button class=\\"btn btn-outline-success\\" type=\\"submit\\">Поиск</button> </form> </div> </div> </nav>","completion":"Для того, чтобы раздел \\"Выпадающий список\\" открывался при наведении, необходимо изменить поведение элемента dropdown с использованием CSS или JavaScript.

However, it's important to first address that selling social media followers, likes, and engagement is generally against the terms of service of most social media platforms and can result in penalties, including banning of accounts involved.

That said, there are legitimate SMM services that focus on advertising and growth strategies to help businesses improve their online presence authentically. If your intent is to create a legitimate SMM site offering advertising, content creation, and audience engagement services, rather than selling fake followers, here is a broad overview of steps you might follow: 1. **Business Planning:** - Determine your business model (whether offering advertising strategies, content management, engagement strategies, growth planning, etc.). - Research your target audience and competitors. - Decide on your pricing model. - Create a business plan outlining your objectives, plans, and financial forecasts. 2. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** - Ensure that your business practices comply with all relevant laws and regulations. - Adhere to the terms of service of social media platforms you will work with. - Consider your ethical stance on the services you provide and how they will impact users and platforms. 3. **Domain Registration and Hosting:** - Choose a domain name that is relevant to your business. - Select a reliable hosting service to ensure uptime and performance. 4. **Website Development:** - Choose a platform to build your website (WordPress, Shopify, custom development, etc.). - Design an intuitive UI/UX to ensure a good user experience. - Develop front-end and back-end functionalities, including service listings, shopping carts, user accounts, payment processing, and more. - Ensure your website is secure, especially if handling personal client data and payment information. 5. **Payment Gateway Integration:** - Integrate a trusted payment gateway for processing transactions. 6. **Marketing and SEO:** - Develop a marketing strategy to promote your SMM services. - Optimize your website for search engines (SEO) to increase visibility. - Utilize social media marketing, pay-per-click advertising, and content marketing to reach potential clients. 7. **Customer Support:** - Set up customer support channels such as email, chat, or phone lines to assist clients. 8. **Monitoring and Analytics:** - Implement tools to track website performance, sales metrics, and customer behavior to inform business decisions. - Use this data to refine your offerings and improve the user experience. 9. **Growth and Scaling:** - As your business grows, invest in better infrastructure and consider expanding your service offerings. - Focus on building trust and reputation through customer reviews and testimonials. 10. **Continual Compliance and Improvement:** - Stay updated with social media platform changes and adapt your services accordingly. - Continually check that your practices comply with laws and ethical standards. - Gather feedback from clients and evolve your services to meet market demands.

The position of King of Korea still exists and Korea is a kingdom de-jure, but the Japanese revive the pre-Joeson Goryeo Kingdom as the local governance of post-Joeson Korea as a Japanese province. In the aftermath of the victory over the Ming and the absorption of the Korean peninsula into Japan, the Japanese Imperial Family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, decides to use this opportunity to reclaim the power it [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] has [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] lost to the shoguns and the samurai class over the years and [ the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control of the Japanese government, essentially making Hideyoshi's roles of Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm into a position akin to the Prime Minister in Western European countries or the Reichkanzler in the Germanic lands while using the excuse of purging the newly claimed Korea of pro-Chinese Confucianist and neo-Confucianist elements, native Korean shamanism as well as the power of Korea's native aristocracy, the yangaban as well as freeing the mostly enslaved Korean population and making the Korean commoners long oppressed by both the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi into Japanese citizens during the integration of post-Joeson Korea into feudal Japan as a means of restoring the imperial system of government in Japan before the establishment of the feudal shogunates in a modern context, although the basic governmental style and social structures of the shogunate remain unchanged. Hideyoshi then replaces Confucianism and neo-Confucianism along with native Korean shamanism in post-Joeson Korea, with the Japanese state religion of Shinto, Buddhism and even Christianity, which mostly succeeds as the yangaban have been replaced with Japanese daimyō [feudal lord/s during Japan's feudal period under the shogunates |daimyō|] and the rediscovery of the native Korean Hangul script for writing the Korean language by the Japanese and its [Hangul's] promotion by the Japanese as the way of writing Korean over the Chinese script known as Hanja used by the now-deposed Joseon royal family and the Yangaban for writing in Korean with Nihongo [the Japanese language/Japanese |Nihongo|] and Kanji [the Chinese characters used to write Nihongo |Kanji|] also being promoted in post-Joeson Japanese Korea. By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession while ensuring that actual power in the Japanese government remains within the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. While this is going on Japan continues to improve and develop its [Japan's] firearms and artillery technology, [Japan] also continuing to improve its [Japan's] naval might while [Japan] solidifying the Ming dynasty's status as an unofficial Japanese vassal and satellite state in a reversal of the usual relationships between China and Japan through joint military exercises, suppression of bandits and would-be usurpers in Cantonia and the deportation of yangaban and Sinophilic House of Jeonju Yi members to Ming-controlled Han China The Tokugawa shogunate still maintains its position of isolation from the rest of the world, although this is challenged by the rise of the Jurchen tribes from Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and their subsequent conquest of China. The Japanese initially support the Ming in the fight against the Jurchens but realize that the conflict will eliminate anti-Japanese elements in China and so allow the Japanese to maintain power in East Asia. The Jurchens conquer much of northern China and even parts of Central China, establishing the Great Qing Empire while the rump state of the Ming becomes the Southern Ming, still under Japanese protection. The half-Japanese Zheng Sen, better known as Koxinga, still establishes the Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning on March 30, 1661 – February 1, 1662 in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, but since his [Koxinga's] mother, Princess Minamoto Matsu aka Tagawa Matsu is closer to her [Matsu's] family [Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty], the Kingdom of Tungning is a Japanese puppet state in all but name. Negotiations with the Qing end the conflict and so East Asia enters a new Three Kingdoms period: The Qing based in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Ming in Han China and the Japanese ruling over the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan and Okinawa. The Southern Ming conquers Indochina, using the opportunity to absorb the Vietnamese into the Han people","completion":"# Chapter VII - The Consolidation of the Eastern Phoenix: The Aftermath of the Imjin War and the Reorganization of the Far East In the shadow of the six-year-long Imjin conflict that had raged from 1592 to 1598, the face of East Asia was transformed. The formerly proud kingdom of Joseon, steeped in its own Confucian tradition and tributary loyalties, found itself annexed, reduced to a province under the now-expansive realm of the Japanese Empire. The Ming, erstwhile hegemon of the region, bowed their heads as a satellite under the vigilant watch of their island neighbors. It was an era that would be recorded by scholars as the 'Nihon Saisei,' the rejuvenation of Japan's imperial dynasty, and the dawn of its golden age of influence. The sun flag of Japan flapped mightily over the craggy terrain of the Korean Peninsula, its introduction as the newest province governed under the revived titles of the Goryeo royalty, yet the true power resonated from Kyoto. In turn, the Imperial House of Great Yamato, an ancient lineage whose roots became mingled with the Minamoto identifiers, seized the opportunity to ascend once more to the pinnacle of Japanese governance. The transition of roles, the movement of the Emperor's position from a revered but restrained figurehead to an empowered sovereign, reasserted the divine nature of the Sun Lineage. Toyotomi Hideyoshi, granted the dual roles of Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, became an architect of the new order. His marriage to Princess Jeongmyeong, a symbol of conciliation, tied the fate of the fallen Joseon to the rising sun. The Toyotomi clan, with his nephew Hidetsugu and later his son Hideyori, projected their influence through their eminent positions, orchestrating an intricate dance to placate both the returning imperial authority and the steadfast daimyo, ensuring the continuity of power. It was under the guidance of Hideyoshi and his successors that the territories of the defunct Joseon were reborn. Purges and upheavals eradicated many elements of the previous regime, targeting the Confucian and shamanist bulwarks of the Yangban and the Jeonju Yi aristocracy. Korea's newly freed populace, still reeling from the dismantling of their societal structure, were adopted as full citizens of their new Japanese home, grateful for the liberties bestowed, unaware of the cords that bound them to their benefactors. Through Hideyoshi's vision, the essence of Japanese spiritual life: Shinto, Buddhism, and even the foreign Christian faith, began to displace the native Korean ideologies. With the common tongue of Hangul recognized and promoted amongst the Korean peasantry, complemented by the introduction and elevation of Nihongo and Kanji, a new cultural fusion blossomed on the peninsula, blending the indigenous with the imported. The turbulent years following Hideyoshi's passing were marked by the continued machinations of the Toyotomi and their rivals, the ascent of Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the union orchestrated between Hideyori and Senhime, ensuring a lineage that bridged two mighty houses. Emperor Go-Yōzei, atop his throne, used these events to cement the role of his dynasty, binding the shogunate to his will. As Japan turned inward, strengthening its grip on its domains and improving the technological marauders of war – the gun and the ship – it watched over its new vassal, the Ming, with a protector's gaze. It was during this tenure that the emergence of a new force, the Jurchen tribes, spurred the movement of the era's grand chessboard. Initially, the shogunate sided with the withering Ming against the barbarian tide, yet foresight dictated a withdrawal, allowing the Jurchens their victory, forging the Great Qing in the vast expanse of Manchuria. The Southern Ming, now pared to the seat of Han China, persisted under the aegis of their island overlords, forced to contend with a fresh challenger: the Qing and the land-hungry ambitions of the Mings seeking new realms beyond Indochina. Koxinga, born Zheng Sen, the half-Japanese prince with connections to the Minamoto imperial blood, carved a Ming-aligned, yet Japanese-influenced bastion of power in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, the Kingdom of Tungning. As ties of lineage bore fruit, this kingdom served as another jewel in the Japanese crown, albeit veiled by the guise of Ming subservience. The ebb and flow of negotiations with the Qing concluded the hostilities, ushering in an era reminiscent of the ancient Three Kingdoms – Qing in the north, Ming in the south, and the Japanese dominion encompassing the archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. And in a gambit for wider control, it was the Mings, under the direction and allowance of their Japanese patrons, that would envelope the nation of Vietnam into the Han fold, redefining the realm of Sinic civilization. Thus was forged a world unique unto itself, an orchestration of power, fidelity, and cultural melding that would build a legacy forever imprinted upon the annals of history."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The \`generate_complete_article\` function already seems geared toward this task. Below is the implementation of the \`generate_complete_article\` function based on your specifications to create 6 tables with different contents: \`\`\`python # ... (previous code) # Your existing function seems to be structured correctly. The function will generate 6 articles. # Make sure you remove the original generate_complete_article invocation at the end if you're running this in the same environment. # Run the script to execute the process if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": list_file_html = [] # Track all articles tanggal_pembuatan = get_current_date() # Let's assume you want to generate a new set of articles once a day index_file_number = int(tanggal_pembuatan.replace('-', '')) # Generate a unique index based on today's date list_file_html = generate_complete_article(tanggal_pembuatan, list_file_html, index_file_number) print(f\\"Halaman index dan artikel dibuat di dalam folder 'Macau'\\") \`\`\` The code is designed to ensure each time point on the current date gets a set of random predictions, and each PDF table will be saved as an article with its filepath passed to the index creation function. Make sure that: - The \`create_index_html\` function correctly stitches together multiple articles. - The \`generate_random_predictions\` function generates sensible prediction data for the articles. - \`index_file_number\` generates a unique index file for each set of articles you want to create on a given day. To execute your complete program: 1. Make sure all the functions (\`create_index_html\`, \`create_articles_content\`, \`create_footer\`, \`buat_html_artikel\`, \`get_current_date\`, \`generate_random_predictions\`, and \`generate_complete_article\`) are included in your script. 2. Ensure the implementation of creating directories (\`Macau\` and \`Macau/prediksi\`) exists at the beginning of your main program. 3. Run the complete script without duplicating function definitions or the script execution trigger (\`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\"\`)."},{"prompt":"from ftplib import FTP import os from tqdm import tqdm def sanitize_directoryname(dirname, existing_dirs): # Ganti karakter yang tidak diizinkan dengan underscore (_) cleaned_name = \\"\\".join(c if c.isalnum() or c in ['.', '_', '-'] else '_' for c in dirname) # Cek apakah nama sudah ada, jika ya tambahkan angka di belakangnya i = 1 new_name = cleaned_name while new_name in existing_dirs: i += 1 new_name = f\\"{cleaned_name}_{i}\\" return new_name def sanitize_filename(filename): # Ganti karakter yang tidak diizinkan dengan underscore (_) return \\"\\".join(c if c.isalnum() or c in ['.', '_', '-'] else '_' for c in filename) def upload_folder_recursive(local_folder_path, ftp_host, ftp_port, ftp_username, ftp_password, ftp_remote_dir): try: print(f\\"Menghubungkan ke server FTP di {ftp_host}:{ftp_port}...\\") # Inisialisasi koneksi FTP ftp = FTP() ftp.connect(ftp_host, ftp_port) ftp.login(ftp_username, ftp_password) # Pindahkan ke direktori di server FTP ftp.cwd(ftp_remote_dir) # Dapatkan daftar direktori yang sudah ada di server FTP existing_dirs = set(ftp.nlst()) # Rekursif: Fungsi untuk mengunggah folder dan seluruh isinya def upload_folder_content(folder_path): for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path): for subfolder in tqdm(dirs, desc=\\"Mengunggah direktori\\", unit=\\"dir\\", dynamic_ncols=True): local_subfolder_path = os.path.join(root, subfolder) remote_subfolder_path = os.path.relpath(local_subfolder_path, folder_path) # Bersihkan nama direktori menggunakan fungsi sanitize_directoryname remote_subfolder_path = sanitize_directoryname(remote_subfolder_path, existing_dirs) # Jika direktori sudah ada, hapus sebelum membuat yang baru if remote_subfolder_path in existing_dirs: try: ftp.rmd(remote_subfolder_path) except Exception as e: print(f\\"Error: {e}\\") print(f\\"Tidak dapat menghapus direktori {remote_subfolder_path}.

The \`upload_folder_content\` function no longer tries to delete existing directories but uploads files and creates directories if they do not exist.

The position of King of Korea still exists and Korea is a kingdom de-jure, but the Japanese revive the pre-Joeson Goryeo Kingdom as the local governance of post-Joeson Korea as a Japanese province. In the aftermath of the victory over the Ming and the absorption of the Korean peninsula into Japan, the Japanese Imperial Family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, decides to use this opportunity to reclaim the power it [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] has [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] lost to the shoguns and the samurai class over the years and [ the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control of the Japanese government, essentially making Hideyoshi's roles of Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm into a position akin to the Prime Minister in Western European countries or the Reichkanzler in the Germanic lands while using the excuse of purging the newly claimed Korea of pro-Chinese Confucianist and neo-Confucianist elements, native Korean shamanism as well as the power of Korea's native aristocracy, the yangaban as well as freeing the mostly enslaved Korean population and making the Korean commoners long oppressed by both the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi into Japanese citizens during the integration of post-Joeson Korea into feudal Japan as a means of restoring the imperial system of government in Japan before the establishment of the feudal shogunates in a modern context, although the basic governmental style and social structures of the shogunate remain unchanged. Hideyoshi then replaces Confucianism and neo-Confucianism along with native Korean shamanism in post-Joeson Korea, with the Japanese state religion of Shinto, Buddhism and even Christianity, which mostly succeeds as the yangaban have been replaced with Japanese daimyō [feudal lord/s during Japan's feudal period under the shogunates |daimyō|] and the rediscovery of the native Korean Hangul script for writing the Korean language by the Japanese and its [Hangul's] promotion by the Japanese as the way of writing Korean over the Chinese script known as Hanja used by the now-deposed Joseon royal family and the Yangaban for writing in Korean with Nihongo [the Japanese language/Japanese |Nihongo|] and Kanji [the Chinese characters used to write Nihongo |Kanji|] also being promoted in post-Joeson Japanese Korea. By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession while ensuring that actual power in the Japanese government remains within the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. While this is going on Japan continues to improve and develop its [Japan's] firearms and artillery technology, [Japan] also continuing to improve its [Japan's] naval might while [Japan] solidifying the Ming dynasty's status as an unofficial Japanese vassal and satellite state in a reversal of the usual relationships between China and Japan through joint military exercises, suppression of bandits and would-be usurpers in Cantonia and the deportation of yangaban and Sinophilic House of Jeonju Yi members to Ming-controlled Han China The Tokugawa shogunate still maintains its position of isolation from the rest of the world, although this is challenged by the rise of the Jurchen tribes from Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and their subsequent conquest of China. The Japanese initially support the Ming in the fight against the Jurchens but realize that the conflict will eliminate anti-Japanese elements in China and so allow the Japanese to maintain power in East Asia. The Jurchens conquer much of northern China and even parts of Central China, establishing the Great Qing Empire while the rump state of the Ming becomes the Southern Ming, still under Japanese protection. The half-Japanese Zheng Sen, better known as Koxinga, still establishes the Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning on March 30, 1661 – February 1, 1662 in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, but since his [Koxinga's] mother, Princess Minamoto Matsu aka Tagawa Matsu is closer to her [Matsu's] family [Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty], the Kingdom of Tungning is a Japanese puppet state in all but name. Negotiations with the Qing end the conflict and so East Asia enters a new Three Kingdoms period: The Qing based in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Ming in Han China and the Japanese ruling over the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan and Okinawa. The Southern Ming conquers Indochina, using the opportunity to absorb the Vietnamese into the Han people and unfortunately totally genocide the Cantonese, Cambodian and Laotian peoples, absorbing the survivors into the Han Chinese.","completion":"**Chapter VII: The Unification of the East Under the Rising Sun** In the annals of East Asian history, the Imjin Wars stand out as a pivotal moment that reshaped the destiny of the region. This chapter delves into the transformative period that followed the unprecedented Japanese victory, detailing the integration of the Korean peninsula into the Japanese realm and the subsequent shifts in power that influenced the political and cultural landscape profoundly. As the dust settled from the Imjin Wars, the Japanese empire, under the Ashikaga shogunate and the dynamic leadership of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, witnessed the dissolution of the ancient kingdom of Joseon. Hideyoshi's strategic acumen and diplomatic ingenuity transpired not only on the battlefield but also in the court, where he took Princess Jeongmyeong as his concubine, intertwining the fates of the two nations intimately. The victory over the Ming and the annexation of Korea as the latest Japanese province facilitated the resurgence of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. Leveraging the restructuring in Korea as a pretext, the imperial family initiated a purge of Confucianism, neo-Confucianism, and native Korean shamanistic practices, dismantling the power structures of the Korean yangban aristocracy. The measures undertaken to replace these systems with Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity were effective, supported by the imposition of new Japanese daimyōs who took the reins from the deposed Korean elites. Akin to a renaissance, this period saw the promotion of the Hangul script, a move that not only preserved Korean culture but also aided in the integration process by facilitating communication and administration. Meanwhile, Nihongo and Kanji were also disseminated throughout the Korean province, establishing a bilingual society that was both culturally rich and politically unified. The passing of Hideyoshi in 1598 marked a turning point. Toyotomi Hidetsugu ascended to Hideyoshi's roles, maintaining a semblance of continuity while the Emperor Go-Yōzei masterfully prevented the naming of a new shogun. The political constellation remained delicately balanced until the rise of Tokugawa Ieyasu, whose ambition nearly reignited the Sengoku period. However, by appointing Ieyasu as shogun and orchestrating the union of the Toyotomi and Tokugawa houses through the marriage of Hideyori and Senhime, Go-Yōzei ensured the preservation of imperial influence over the governance of Japan. The strategic emphasis on military innovation, particularly in firearms, artillery, and naval forces, enabled Japan to solidify its hold over the Ming dynasty, transforming the traditional tributary relationship into one of fealty. This era witnessed the joint suppression of dissent in both Korea and Ming-held territories, further entrenching Japanese hegemony over East Asia. As Manchuria's Jurchen tribes asserted their dominance over northern and Central China, leading to the emergence of the Qing Empire, the shrewdness of Japanese diplomacy came to the fore. While initially supporting the beleaguered Ming against the Jurchens, Japan ultimately recognized the long-term advantages of a weakened China, which continued to bolster the regional primacy of the Japanese empire. Amidst these geopolitical upheavals, Zheng Sen, known by his nom de guerre Koxinga and bearing Japanese maternal lineage, established the Kingdom of Tungning. Though bearing the Ming insignia, Tungning operated as a sovereign extension of Japanese influence. The resolved conflicts with the Qing would set the stage for a tripartite balance of power in East Asia, reminiscent of an ancient \\"Three Kingdoms\\" era—redefined by the Qing in the north, the Japanese domain stretching from the home islands to Taiwan, and the Southern Ming ensconced in Han China. It was during this epoch that the Southern Ming, sheltered under Japanese auspices, expanded southward into Indochina. The tragic consequence of this expansion was the erasure of distinct ethnic identities such as the Cantonese, Cambodian, and Laotian peoples, absorbed into the greater Han collective. Though controversial, this legacy of conquest and assimilation demonstrated the relentless drive for unity and power that characterized the Ming under Japanese patronage. The age at hand, therefore, is a testament to the profound changes that shaped the regional tapestry of power, culture, and identity—a tapestry woven with threads of warfare, diplomacy, and the measured hand of the Japanese emperors, whose subtle mastery of statecraft gave rise to an era of centralized imperium over the far-reaching Japanese province and its affiliates."},{"prompt":"Once upon a time, on a distant planet named Chocolata, there existed a peculiar species known as the Chocolians. These aliens were not your typical extraterrestrial beings; they were made entirely of molten, gooey chocolate. Their entire bodies resembled flowing rivers of smooth, delectable cocoa. It was a unique and magical sight to behold. The Chocolians had built their civilization in the heart of a vast cocoa forest, where trees bore chocolate-covered leaves, and caramel waterfalls cascaded down mountains of fudge. They lived peacefully, cherishing their world’s natural abundance of sweetness. Their society was advanced, thriving on the principles of harmony, art, and chocolate craftsmanship. Every Chocolian possessed the remarkable ability to manipulate, sculpt, and form their molten chocolate bodies into intricate shapes and designs. Not only were they masters of chocolate crafts, but they also had an undying passion for exploration. One day, a brilliant Chocolian named Coco proposed an ambitious idea to the Chocolian Council. Coco had discovered a distant planet rich in cocoa beans, which they believed held the key to expanding their delightful universe. The council enthusiastically approved the mission, and a team of dedicated Chocolians was formed, including Coco.

They crafted chocolate sculptures, fountains, and even chocolate brilliance to illuminate their evenings. Chocoheaven became a haven of purest chocolate pleasure, where they shared their sugary treats, laughter, and stories, akin to earthly campfires. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as the explorers indulged in their newfound passion for chocolate artistry. But soon, they realized that the Chocoheaven beans were depleting quickly, threatening the future of both their mission and their beloved planet Chocolata. In an act of selflessness, Coco proposed they return to Chocolata, carrying with them an abundance of cocoa beans to revitalize their world and ensure its survival. The explorers unanimously agreed, packing their interstellar vessel with the finest cargo of beans they had collected. Returning home, they were welcomed as heroes, celebrated for their bravery and wisdom. Using the abundance of cocoa beans brought from Chocoheaven, they transformed their world into an even more mesmerizing chocolate paradise. The Chocolians shared their creations with other alien civilizations, spreading sweetness and joy throughout the galaxy. And so, the Chocolian species continued its legacy, blending their passion for exploration with their love for chocolate. They would forever be known as the divine creators of exquisite chocolate art, forged from their molten, gooey bodies. Their tale would be passed down from generation to generation, a reminder that joy, unity, and the sweetness of life could be found in every corner of the universe. Write a story about a girl from that planet who is celebrating her birthday Once upon a time, in the delightful world of Chocolata, there lived a young girl named Chocoletta.

Chocoletta eagerly unwrapped it, revealing a sculpted, intricately designed chocolate mask that sparkled under the room’s chocolate-chip light fixtures. It was a mask fit for a birthday princess. “Don this mask, my dear,” Chocoliva said, winking mischievously. “It holds a secret surprise for your birthday adventure!” Chocoletta gingerly placed the mask over her face. Suddenly, the world around her transformed. Everything appeared brighter and more vibrant. The chocolate rivers sparkled like liquid gold, and the candy-colored trees seemed to dance with joy. With her new mask, Chocoletta embarked on a grand birthday adventure. Her parents had prepared a treasure hunt, hiding delectable surprises throughout the cocoa forest. Chocoletta followed the hints left in caramel handwriting, discovering chocolate truffles hidden behind fudge rocks and nougat-filled chocolates hanging from marshmallow tree branches. Each find brought her closer to the final treasure. Finally, she reached a clearing adorned with a massive cake made entirely of molten chocolate.

Years passed, and Chocoletta grew older, never forgetting her incredible adventure with Zappar. She would often gaze at the stars, wondering if one day fate would reunite them. Then, one magical night, a shooting star streaked across the sky, leaving behind a glittering trail of stardust. Chocoletta had a feeling of joy that she couldn’t quite explain. She knew, deep down, that it was her dear alien friend, Zappar, sending a message from his faraway home. From that day on, Chocoletta continued to explore the wonders of Chocolata, sharing her love for chocolate, and keeping the memory of her friend close to her heart. And somewhere in the vastness of the universe, Zappar looked upon the chocolate-colored planet, knowing that true friendships could span galaxies and fill hearts with sweetness, no matter how distant they may be.

It was an almost deserted world with vast deserts of fine silvery sand that shimmered under the light of its twin suns. Life was scarce, save for a peculiar squid-like alien known as Squiddles, the last of an ancient line of creatures that had inhabited the planet for eons. Meanwhile, Chocoletta, the adventurous Chocolian girl, had embarked on a voyage of discovery aboard her chocolate-craft spaceship. Her insatiable curiosity had led her to chart a course for Solitaria, intrigued by the mysterious signals emanating from its surface. Upon her arrival, the planet’s desolate beauty captivated her. She stepped out of her spacecraft, her chocolatey form casting a delightful aroma into the alien air. Roaming the silver dunes, Chocoletta reveled in the solitude and the vastness of this lonely planet. Unknown to her, Squiddles watched from a distance. Driven by hunger and the unfamiliar scent of rich, sweet chocolate, the squid-like alien approached Chocoletta with caution. Years of solitude had made Squiddles curious about this strange, gooey visitor. Before Chocoletta could react, Squiddles extended a tentacle and gave her a gentle lick. To Squiddles’ amazement, the taste was like nothing it had ever experienced – rich, sweet, and utterly delectable. Overcome with the urge to feast, Squiddles’ eyes gleamed with hunger. Alarmed by the squid-like creature’s appetite, Chocoletta jumped back and quickly composed herself. She understood that her chocolatey essence could be mistaken for food, and she needed to explain to Squiddles why she was not a treat to be indulged. “Dear Squiddles,” Chocoletta said warmly, her voice smooth and soothing, “I am not a snack for you to savor. My name is Chocoletta, and I come from the planet Chocolata, where all beings are made of chocolate. We are not to be eaten; we are a sentient species, filled with dreams, thoughts, and emotions, much like yourself.” Squiddles paused, absorbing her words. Its squid-like curiosity was piqued by the idea of a chocolate being with feelings and aspirations. Chocoletta continued to speak, sharing stories of her home planet and its vibrant culture, mesmerizing Squiddles with tales of caramel waterfalls and mountains of fudge. As they conversed, a bond began to form. Chocoletta recognized the loneliness in Squiddles, and she empathized with the creature’s isolated existence. In turn, Squiddles saw a friend in Chocoletta, a lifeline to the outside world it had longed for. Chocoletta made Squiddles a promise that she would return to visit and bring others to learn about this unique, almost deserted planet. In return, Squiddles vowed never to try to eat Chocoletta again, respecting her as a newfound friend. With a growing sense of friendship and mutual respect, Chocoletta and Squiddles explored Solitaria together. Chocoletta showed Squiddles her chocolate-craft spaceship and promised to send messages across the stars, speaking of her new friend and the wonders of the forgotten world. As the twin suns set, casting a dual shadow over the sands of Solitaria, the most unlikely of friendships had been forged. Chocoletta said her farewells and boarded her spaceship, leaving Squiddles with a piece of chocolate sculpture, a token of their bond. Squiddles watched as the spaceship soared into the cosmic unknown, a tiny speck of light amongst the stars. And in the midst of the emptiness of Solitaria, there was now hope and anticipation for the new connections that would surely come, all thanks to the sweet-hearted visitor named Chocoletta.In the vast canvas of the cosmos, there existed a small blue planet known as Aquinia—a world predominantly covered by serene, azure waters and dotted with picturesque islands. Among its inhabitants was a young boy named Marino, who spent his days dreaming of the great beyond and the mysteries that lay within the stars. Marino’s curiosity about the universe was insatiable. From the shores of his oceanic domain, he would gaze up at the sky, watching the dance of planets and comets, wondering if life existed beyond his watery world. One day, as the twin moons of Aquinia rose above the horizon, a shooting star cut through the evening sky. However, this was no mere meteor—it was a chocolate-craft spaceship piloted by Chocoletta, the amorphous Chocolian girl known for her spirited heart and molten chocolate form. Chocoletta’s spaceship gently landed on a soft sandy beach, the whir of its engines sending flocks of colorful birds into flight. The hatch opened, and out stepped Chocoletta, her body glistening in the moonlight. Even on this strange planet, she exuded an aura of warmth and sweetness that seemed to touch everything around her. Hidden in the foliage, Marino watched with wide-eyed wonder as this unique, chocolate-made being explored the lush environment. His imagination ran wild with the possibilities. Could she be a shapeshifting creature from a distant galaxy? Was she here for exploration, or perhaps on a mission of great importance? Unable to contain his curiosity, Marino emerged from his hiding place and approached Chocoletta. The sight of her gooey, amorphous body astounded him. Her form moved with fluid grace, as if she were a living sculpture constantly reshaping itself. “Hello!” Chocoletta greeted him with a shining smile. “I’m Chocoletta, from the planet Chocolata. What is your name?” “I-I’m Marino,” the boy stammered, still in disbelief. “Are you made of… chocolate? Like the kind we have here as a treat?” Laughter bubbled from Chocoletta like the sweetest melody. “Yes, I am! But I’m also alive, just like you. On Chocolata, we are all made of chocolate, and we sculpt our world—our homes, our artwork, everything!” Marino’s amazement grew as Chocoletta extended a chocolatey tentacle-like limb and gingerly shook his hand. The sensation was surprising—not sticky or messy, but warm and smooth, just like the surface of a finely crafted chocolate figure. Marino invited Chocoletta to explore Aquinia. Hand in hand, they traversed the beaches, navigated the rocky cliffs, and dipped their toes into the clear blue waters. Marino shared stories of his planet, explaining how water was the essence of life for his people. In turn, Chocoletta captivated Marino with tales of her own world, of Chocolata’s cocoa forests, and the way her people used their creativity and passion for crafting masterpieces of chocolate art. Her descriptions of caramel waterfalls and rivers of molten chocolate made Marino’s mouth water with longing. As the day turned to evening and the sky painted itself with the colors of the setting suns, Marino realized how much he had learned from the chocolate visitor. Chocoletta, too, felt a warm sense of kinship with the boy from Aquinia. Before Chocoletta resumed her journey amongst the stars, she gifted Marino a small sculpture—a perfect replica of his island, crafted in solid chocolate. In return, Marino gave her a vial of Aquinian water, a token of his world to carry with her on her travels. With promises to visit again and a friendship forged across the stellar divide, Chocoletta boarded her chocolate-craft spaceship, and Marino waved goodbye as the vessel rose into the skies, its hull reflecting the twin moons’ radiant glow. From that day onward, Marino watched the heavens with greater hope, knowing that the universe was full of friends yet to be made. And Chocoletta continued her cosmic exploration, her heart filled with memories of the young boy who marveled at her gooey, amorphous form, and the planet where water was as precious as chocolate was on her own. Write a story where she meets a Chocolian poet named Wally On the lush, sweet-scented planet of Chocolata, where the trees bore confectionery leaves and the rivers were ribbons of creamy cocoa, there existed a community that celebrated the artistry in everything, from their chocolate crafts to the eloquence of words. Among them was a young poet named Wally, whose verses were as rich and deep as the darkest chocolate from the forests’ heart. Wally was known across Chocolata for his ability to weave words into delicious tapestries of emotion and imagination. His poetry readings were eagerly awaited events, where Chocolians of all ages would gather to hear him recite stanzas that made their chocolate hearts swell with pride and joy. One day, as Wally sat under a canopy of chocolate-covered boughs, contemplating his next poem, he encountered Chocoletta, the adventurous and amorphous girl with a shimmering, chocolate mask. She approached him with a glowing smile, her chocolatey locks swirling around her like ribbons caught in a gentle breeze. “Good day, Wally,” Chocoletta greeted, her voice a sweet symphony that accompanied the rustling leaves. “I have heard much about your beautiful words that paint pictures in our minds. Would you honor me with a verse or two?” Wally’s cocoa eyes brightened at the chance to share his latest work. “Certainly, Chocoletta. Poetry is meant to be shared, like a fine chocolate on a summer’s evening. Please, sit alongside me and listen to the new poem I have composed.” The poet cleared his throat and began to recite. His words flowed like molten chocolate, wrapping Chocoletta in a blanket of metaphor and melody. He spoke of the caramel dawn, the nougat-flecked skies at night, and the love that bound all Chocolians together in an eternal bond of sweetness. Each line was a tribute to the wonders of their world. Chocoletta listened, captivated. His words stirred something deep within her, igniting her own chocolatey essence with sparks of inspiration. When Wally finished, the realm of Chocolata felt even more magical, and the bond of their shared heritage stronger. “Wally, your poetry moves me,” Chocoletta exclaimed. “It makes me want to explore every corner of our planet and beyond. You transform the beauty we see every day into something grand.” Chuckling warmly, Wally replied, “And your spirit, Chocoletta, makes you the perfect muse for any poet. Would you join me on a walk? Poetry is not just in words, but in the paths we tread and the sights we behold.” Together, they set out on a stroll through the cocoa forest. Chocoletta shared stories of her interstellar journeys and the fascinating beings she had encountered. The poet was entranced; he saw new poems taking shape, fueled by the adventures of the girl with the gooey, amorphous form. As they walked, Wally noted the details of the world around them—the way a drop of dew glistened on a chocolate leaf, the pattern of the caramel veins that run through the chocolate barks, the whispers of the wind carrying the scent of distant sugar fields. Each observation became a line in his mind, a simple verse that captured the essence of their planet’s chocolate wonders. In return, Chocoletta encouraged Wally to dream of the stars and the wonders beyond Chocolata. She spoke of the desserts she had seen on other planets—clouds made of cotton candy, meteor showers that sparkled like sprinkles—and Wally’s imagination soared. His next composition, he decided, would be about the cosmos, as seen through Chocoletta’s eyes. The day turned into evening, and the fudge mountains cast long shadows over them. The two friends sat by a chocolate stream, reflecting on the blend of art and exploration that defined their lives. Wally crafted a poem on the spot, a piece that encapsulated their shared journey and the intertwining of their worlds. As stars blanketed the sky, Chocoletta knew she had found a friend and a kindred spirit in Wally. The chocolate poet had found a muse, a living embodiment of adventure and wonder that would ignite his words for many cycles to come. And in the times that followed, whenever Wally recited his cosmic-inspired poems, Chocoletta would be there, listening intently, her chocolatey tentacle wrapped warmly around his, their friendship a testament to the sweet intersection of poetry and exploration on the chocolate-coated planet of Chocolata. Write a story where Zappar sees them, he marvels at Wally’s gooey, blobby form as well In the boundless cosmos, among stars twinkling like distant sugar crystals, the green-skinned alien Zappar piloted his sleek spacecraft through the galaxy. His journeys had led him to countless worlds, but his heart always fondly remembered the chocolate paradise called Chocolata and the gooey, amiable girl named Chocoletta. It was during another such expedition, when the familiar urge to visit his chocolatey friends overtook him, that Zappar set course for Chocolata once more. Upon reaching the candy-coated skies of the planet, his ship descended through clouds of powdered sugar, landing amongst the cocoa groves that he had come to cherish. Eager to reunite with his friend, Zappar departed his craft and ventured into the heart of the forest, where the scent of chocolate hung heavy in the air. Not long into his search, he paused at the sight of two figures deep in conversation by a chocolate stream. One was unmistakably Chocoletta—her gooey, delectable form resonating with energy and vitality. The other was a Chocolian he hadn’t met, a being with a rich, molten appearance that seemed to constantly shift and shimmer. Zappar approached, intrigued by the new character’s blobby and captivating presence. Chocoletta spotted him first, and her cocoa eyes lit up with joy. “Zappar!” Chocoletta called out, her voice as melodious as a chocolate fountain’s babbling. “You’ve come back! Come meet my new friend—this is Wally, Chocolata’s cherished poet.” Wally turned to Zappar and offered a gooey tentacle in greeting, his form a fascinating spectacle of flowing chocolate. Zappar, accustomed to the unique physiognomies of the universe, shook it, marveling at the pleasantly warm, blobby texture that Wally possessed—a perfect blend of crafted solidity and malleable creativity. “A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Wally,\\" Zappar said. \\"Chocoletta has spoken fondly of Chocolata’s poets during her tales of exploration. And through her, I’ve developed a keen interest in your art.” Wally blushed a deeper shade of chocolate, clearly humbled. “Thank you, Zappar. It is rare that our poetry reaches ears from beyond the stars. I am delighted to know that our words travel so far.” With mutual curiosity, the trio sat by the stream, and it wasn’t long before they fell into a lively exchange of stories and knowledge. Chocoletta and Wally listened raptly as Zappar described alien vistas composed of stunning crystals and floating mountains. In return, Wally recited a new poem, his gooey body shifting animatedly with each line, crafting shapes that illustrated his rich verses. His spectacle was mesmerizing as his form became one with his words, portraying the emotional depth and visual landscapes of his poetry. As the audience of one, Zappar found himself equally captivated by the rhythm and fluidity of Wally’s poetry as he was by the natural, gooey movements that accompanied it. Each verse painted a picture so vivid that Zappar could almost see the caramel dawns and nougat-streaked nights come to life before him. When the poem ended, a sense of wonder hung in the air, and Zappar knew that this encounter was a unique treasure that he would carry with him across the endless expanse of space. The day melted into evening, with the twin sunsets of Chocolata casting an amber glow over the chocolate land. Zappar, Chocoletta, and Wally shared in laughter and chocolatey treats, forming a bond that transcended their diverse origins. And from that day forth, the legend of the alien visitor and the Chocolian poet became yet another delightful tale to be told across Chocolata—a story of interstellar friendship, artistic expression, and the gooey bonds that held them together, as timeless as the stars themselves. Write a diary entry from him about the planet and its dominant species Stardate: 83425.78 Dear Diary, Today marks the end of another incredible visit to the enchanting world of Chocolata, a planet that never ceases to amaze me. Each moment spent on its surface is like stepping into a living fairytale woven from the fabric of dreams and sugar. The dominant species of this world, the Chocolians, are as delightful as the environment they inhabit. Their society is a sweet composition of artistry, harmony, and genuine warmth. Their bodies, entirely composed of molten chocolate, allow them to shift and mold into any form—a trait that still astounds me despite my numerous travels across the galaxy. My continued friendship with Chocoletta, a girl whose spirit is as effervescent as the fizz in a bottle of soda, brought an unexpected gift during this voyage in the form of Wally, Chocolata’s beloved poet. Wally, like all Chocolians, can manipulate his chocolate form masterfully, but his skill extends into the realm of prose, where he crafts verses that could soften even the hardest of hearts. The culture of the Chocolians fascinates me to no end. They have built a civilization that thrives amidst a landscape teeming with the most extraordinary cocoa trees whose leaves are dipped in chocolate. Their architectural feats, made from the very substance of their bodies, showcase their deep appreciation for creativity. The buildings resemble artistic sculptures, each one unique and splendid in its design. Today, I joined Chocoletta and Wally by a stream of pure liquid chocolate, sharing tales of distant nebulae and celestial wonders. In turn, they shared with me the flavors of their home—confections that danced upon the palette, leaving behind the taste of joy and nostalgia. The unity and love that the Chocolians harbor for each other and their environment are palpable. There is a sense of togetherness here that I have seldom felt elsewhere; it dwells within the very air that carries the delectable scent of their sweetened world. As I write this entry, I smile, reflecting on the day’s events and the connections forged. Chocolata is more than just a planet; it is a testament to the intoxicating beauty that thrives when a species lives in harmony with their world. The Chocolians, with their gooey, chocolatey appearances and hearts, embody a pure form of existence that many civilizations could only hope to achieve. I carry with me a piece of this place, not just in the chocolate sculptures gifted by Chocoletta or in the poignant lines of Wally’s poetry, but in the very essence of the memories I’ve created here. Chocolata and its inhabitants will forever hold a special place in my heart—an oasis of sweetness in the vast and sometimes unforgiving expanse of space. As my ship departs, leaving a trail of stardust in its wake, I vow to continue my journeys, bolstered by the spirit of friendship and the reminder that sometimes the greatest discoveries are not of new landscapes, but of kindred souls. Until we meet again, Chocolata. Yours among the stars, Zappar.

Var'yu, hailing from a race of crystalline beings, possessed a natural affinity for the various wonders of the universe. His people were explorers by nature, gifted in the art of witnessing and chronicling the fantastic oddities scattered across the galaxies. Var'yu's quest for knowledge led him to a small, alluring planet known to the galactic travelers as Chocolata. From the moment he entered its orbit, he was enchanted by the intoxicating aroma of cocoa and sugar that wafted through the void, bypassing the sterile confines of his ship to tickle his senses. He landed amid a forest where the very air was dusted with powdered sugar and the leaves glistened with a chocolate patina. Var'yu disembarked, his crystalline form refracting the chocolate-colored light that bathed the forest floor. It wasn't long before Var'yu's gem-like eyes fell upon a sight that confounded his expectations. A Chocolian girl, distinctly different from the stoic trees and static environment, was in the midst of a transformation. She was Chocoletta. Her body moved like liquid art, an expressive cascade of molten chocolate that captivated Var'yu. As he watched, hidden under an alcove of caramel vines, Chocoletta seemed to be practicing her shape-shifting abilities. One moment she was a tall figure resembling a traditional Chocolian, and the next, she morphed into a collection of animals native to her planet—each sculpture bolder and more intricate than the last. Var'yu, in his many cycles of travel, had seen beings who could alter their forms, but none did it with the mesmerizing fluidity and artistry of Chocoletta. Her chocolatey mass ebbed and flowed as her concentration took her from one silhouette to another, each transition as smooth as cream poured into hot coffee. Unable to contain his curiosity and eager to learn more, Var'yu approached the Chocolian shapeshifter. As he emerged from his shelter, the sugar leaves crumbled beneath his crystalline feet, announcing his presence. Chocoletta, sensing the foreign energy, swiftly returned to her humanoid form, her eyes meeting Var'yu's with an inviting warmth. \\"Greetings, traveler,\\" she said, her voice as rich and welcoming as the world she called home. Var'yu introduced himself, words spilling out in admiration. \\"Apologies for the intrusion, but I am Var'yu, a chronicler of the universe's melodies. Your ability to metamorphosize—is it common to your people or unique to you alone?\\" Chocoletta beamed with pride. \\"It is a trait of the Chocolians, though each of us expresses it differently. Some craft elaborate art, others create tools or abodes. I find joy in embodying the creatures that roam our planet as a form of dance and expression.\\" Var'yu was transfixed. With Chocoletta's consent, he activated a small device that began to record her shape-shifting in high-definition, capturing every graceful transition—her movements a visual symphony that told the story of her culture and its connection to the world around them. By-standers, Chocolians drawn by their interaction, gathered to watch the display. They too began to showcase their own chocolate transformations, adding to the spectacle. Var'yu was delighted, documenting each display with the fervor of one who had discovered a new universe. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the forest was alive with a myriad of forms—a testament to the creativity and skill of Chocoletta and her kin. Var'yu felt a profound sense of gratitude for the opportunity to glimpse such an extraordinary art form. When it was time to part, Chocoletta fashioned a small, intricate sculpture of Var'yu's ship, a token for him to remember Chocolata by. In return, Var'yu offered a crystal from his homeworld, shimmering with the same beauty that he saw in her and her people. \\"The universe,\\" Var'yu mused as he left the chocolate planet's atmosphere, \\"is truly an unending gallery of life's expressions, and today, I had the honor to witness one of its most delightful exhibits.\\" Chocoletta, watching the alien craft streak across the sky, felt a connection to the stars. Her heart swelled with the same sense of wonder that travelers like Var'yu carried with them—a wonder that transcended the boundaries of form and substance, and celebrated the endless possibilities of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"Write a story about one Chocolian who usually takes on an blobby, amorphous appearance,","completion":"In the heart of the cocoa forests of Chocolata, there lived a Chocolian named Moltrus. Unlike his fellow Chocolians, who often shaped themselves into well-defined forms, Moltrus preferred to maintain a blobby, amorphous appearance. His molten chocolate form was ever-flowing, like a gentle lava lamp made of rich, dark chocolate. Though he could sculpt himself into intricate shapes just as his peers did, Moltrus found a unique sense of freedom in the fluidity of his natural state. The other Chocolians sometimes questioned Moltrus's choice to remain unstructured. \\"Moltrus,\\" they would say, \\"why do you not fashion yourself a pair of eyes, or a mouth? Why do you not mimic the trees or the mountains?\\" But Moltrus would simply ripple in a way that suggested contentment, and continue on his way. Moltrus lived in a portion of the forest where the chocolate rivers wound around trees like ribbons of glossy ganache and marshmallow flowers blossomed with centers of colorful candy. In this serene environment, Moltrus felt at peace, his amorphous body harmonizing with the babbling sounds of the liquid chocolate streams and the soft rustling of sugar leaves. One day, as the twin suns of Chocolata shone brightly, casting a caramel glow over the land, a problem arose. A young Chocolian child had ventured too far into the cocoa forest and had found themselves stuck at the peak of a whipped cream hill. The other Chocolians, defined by their solid, statue-like shapes, found it challenging to navigate the soft, malleable terrain to rescue the child. News of the child's plight quickly reached Moltrus, who pondered for a moment before oozing towards the base of the whipped cream hill. His fellow Chocolians watched, curious and anxious, as Moltrus approached the dilemma in his own unique way. As he reached the base of the hill, Moltrus began to rise upward, his form spreading out in multiple directions, creating a vast web of chocolate tendrils that snaked up the hillside. Without a predefined shape to confine him, he was able to distribute his weight evenly and ascend the fragile whipped cream without sinking. The child, upon seeing Moltrus's approach, felt a wave of relief. Moltrus extended a portion of his body—smooth and comforting—to the stranded Chocolian. With careful, gentle motions, he enveloped the child in his chocolatey mass, securing them safely within his blobby form. The descent was slow and deliberate as Moltrus retracted his tendrils. He moved with calculated fluidity, ensuring the child's safety and comfort. The onlookers held their breath, hoping that the unusual strategy would succeed. Finally, Moltrus reached solid ground, and the child was carefully released, unharmed and smiling. Cheers erupted among the Chocolians, who rushed forward to embrace their kin. Moltrus, still shapeless and undulating happily, was suddenly the center of attention. His unique form, once the subject of puzzled whispers, was now celebrated as a gift—a testament to the versatility and strength found in diversity. That day, the Chocolian community learned a valuable lesson about acceptance and the beauty of individuality. Moltrus, who had seemed like an outlier, had reminded them of the importance of embracing who they were, regardless of form or appearance. From that day on, Moltrus was hailed as a hero, his name synonymous with courage and innovation. He continued to reside in his beloved cocoa forest, a blobby guardian whose very presence was a beacon of comfort and a reminder that, in the world of Chocolata, every state of being had its place and purpose."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about the Chocolians that do give themselves shapes and features, but otherwise maintain a molten appearance, Chocoletta and Wally are part of this group","completion":"In the delightful realm of Chocolata, where the air was scented with the richness of cocoa and the landscapes were crafted from every conceivable type of chocolate, most Chocolians embraced the art of self-shaping while maintaining their inherently molten appearances. Among these skilled artisans of their own form were Chocoletta and Wally, two Chocolians celebrated for their unique contributions to their culture. Chocoletta was known for her whimsical and intricate designs, often adorning herself with features that sparkled and danced with the light. Her eyes, always in a state of joyous expression, were like two shining truffles, and her smile was a crafted curve that held the sweetness of milk chocolate. She delighted in fashioning herself flowing gowns of woven chocolate strands, complete with radiant patterns that mirrored the beauty of their chocolate world. Wally, the poet laureate of Chocolata, took a more minimalistic approach. He would shape his form to create a tranquil and thoughtful expression upon his face, one that reflected the depth of his rich, emotive verses. His hands were always fashioned just so, allowing him to write with precision in the air—his words hanging like chocolate sculptures for all to see and admire. One fabled evening, as the stars sprinkled the sky like sugar dust, the Chocolians gathered for a celebration of creativity—a festival that honored their ability to shape not just their surroundings but themselves. It was here, amid the cocoa groves and candy-flower meadows, that the most spectacular displays of self-shaping were held. Chocoletta stepped forth, her molten form shimmering beneath her uniquely crafted garment of interwoven chocolate ribbons. Her presentation was a ballet of transformation, as she danced and morphed with each pirouette and leap. Every spin brought a new feature, a new detail—butterflies fluttering around her head, flowers blossoming upon her dress, and even chocolate birds taking flight from her outstretched arms. The audience was entranced by her fluid performance, a showcase of perpetual reinvention. Next, Wally approached the central stage, the crowd hushing in anticipation of what was to come. The chocolate poet stood still, his molten form a calm, dark canvas against the evening’s glow. With a deep breath, he began to recite, his body shifting and pulsing with each spoken word. Letters formed upon his arms, stanzas etched across his chest, and his face's features appeared, and disappeared, in tune with the rhythm of his poetry. The beauty of Wally's performance was in its elegant simplicity. The words took shape, creating images of the chocolate cosmos they knew, of caramel comets and fudge asteroids. He painted visions of the winds that whispered sweet nothings to the sugar leaves, and of the harmonious existence shared by all Chocolians. As the festival carried on into the night, Chocolians of all shapes and talents displayed their artistry, proving that within each molten form resided endless possibilities. Chocoletta and Wally moved amongst their friends and loved ones—part of a community that knew no bounds in creativity, united by their love for chocolate and the expressions of self that chocolate allowed. Their festival proved more than just a gathering; it was a testament to the culture of Chocolata, a world where chocolate was more than sustenance—it was a way of life, a mode of expression, and a means to bond. As dawn broke, tinting the horizon with hues of dark, milk, and white chocolate layers, the Chocolians rested, their shaped features softening slightly with contented fatigue, secure in the knowledge that in Chocolata, individuality was not only cherished—it was celebrated."},{"prompt":"Write a story where she meets Moltrus and she asks him why he remains a blob","completion":"Amidst the verdant cocoa groves of Chocolata, where the scent of the sweetest chocolate hung in the air like a delectable perfume, Chocoletta ventured through the forest with a heart full of curiosity. Her molten chocolate form was adorned with the intricate designs she so loved to fashion, from the twirl of her hair to the tips of her carefully crafted chocolate shoes. As she made her way through the forest, her eyes caught a glimpse of something unusual—Moltrus. Unlike her and her intricately shaped companions, Moltrus was content to exist as an unconfined, ever-changing blob of chocolate. He meandered through the woods without any discernible features, a fluid silhouette against the backdrop of solid chocolate trees. Chocoletta approached Moltrus, her movement as graceful as a river of warm chocolate. \\"Good day, Moltrus,\\" she greeted, her tone as melodious as the streams that trickled through their land. \\"Your form intrigues me so. Among countless Chocolians who celebrate their shape-shifting art, why do you choose to remain without shape?\\" Moltrus's surface shivered with a chuckle, though no face formed to express it. His voice emanated warmly from his formless self, rich and resonant like a deep pool of dark chocolate. \\"Ah, Chocoletta, ever the seeker of answers,\\" he replied. \\"Most of our kind find joy in defining their contours, in being seen as they wish to be seen. As for me, I find freedom in the undefined. There's a certain peace to be found in simplicity, in being ever malleable to the whims of nature and of one's deepest self.\\" Chocoletta listened, her truffle eyes reflecting a thoughtful glint. She had always taken pride in her artistic external expressions, in the visual harmony she created with her appearance. Moltrus's perspective was an unexplored flavor in the rich variety of their culture. \\"It is interesting,\\" Chocoletta mused, \\"how we are each crafted from the same sweet substance, yet we can experience our existence so differently. Does it not bring you joy to take shape, even for a moment?\\" Moltrus rippled as if contemplating a new form. Then, just as easily, he settled back into his natural state. \\"It is not that I cannot appreciate the beauty of shape and the delight it brings,\\" he said. \\"It's that I revel in the possibility that I can be anything and nothing, all at once. The forest understands me—these trees have their defined beauty, and I have my undefined essence. When I flow through the underbrush or settle upon the earth, I am one with Chocolata in a way that is truest to me.\\" Chocoletta watched as Moltrus demonstrated his words, spreading across the ground like a warm blanket over a bed of marshmallow flowers. It was a harmony of existence she'd never considered—a ballad of being in its purest form. Moved by his perspective, Chocoletta knelt beside Moltrus and reached out. Using her skill, she fashioned a hand of chocolate for a brief touch, respecting his formless nature. \\"Thank you, Moltrus,\\" she said softly. \\"Your words are as profound as Wally's poetry. You have shown me that beauty is not always something to be seen, but also to be felt and experienced.\\" Moltrus collected himself back to his usual blob, responding, \\"And you, Chocoletta, represent the boundless creativity that exists within our kind. Together, we make Chocolata the diverse and wondrous place it is.\\" As they parted ways, Chocoletta with a new appreciation for the abstract, and Moltrus in his serene tranquility, the forest seemed to sigh with contentment. Two beings of chocolate, one shaped with precision, the other a formless essence, had found common ground, continuing their dance of existence through the cocoa-laden air of Chocolata."},{"prompt":"Write about the shape Chocoletta usually takes","completion":"Chocoletta typically chose a form that was as enchanting and vivacious as her personality. Her usual shape was that of a Chocolian girl, reflecting her youthful and adventurous spirit. Every aspect of her appearance was meticulously crafted to convey joy and creativity. Her face, framed by whirls of sculpted chocolate hair, bore a radiant smile that seemed to cast a gentle glow around her. Her eyes, crafted from the finest dark truffles, sparkled with the deep richness of chocolate yet were bright with a layer of sweet anticipation for every new experience. Every blink was a delicate curl of chocolate shavings that caught the light and reminded onlookers of the delight found in a well-made confection. The chocolate that made up her body had the warm, luscious hue of milk chocolate with swirls of darker shades to add depth and complexity. She was often adorned with accents of white chocolate that served as elegant highlights, punctuating her form with a contrast that drew the eye. Her arms and hands were slender and graceful, capable of sculpting and creating the chocolate artistry she was so fond of. Chocoletta's attire was an extension of her artistic soul. She wore a flowing dress seemingly spun from the most delicate strands of chocolate silk, twined with intricate patterns that shimmered like the frosted designs on fine truffles. At times, her gown seemed to be sprinkled with tiny flakes of gold leaf, catching the light with every movement and leaving a trail of dazzle in her wake. Around her neck, she often wore a necklace of chocolate gems—a collection of assorted cocoa beans polished to a high sheen and threaded together with strands of sugar-spun delicacy. Her shoes were no less fantastic, shaped into dainty curves and whorls, resembling the intricate pralines and bonbons revered by chocolate connoisseurs. But perhaps Chocoletta's most distinctive feature was her wings—she loved the idea of flight, the freedom it represented—so she gifted herself with a pair of delicate, ornate wings that arched gracefully from her back. They were filigreed chocolate masterpieces, delicate and lace-like, yet strong enough to carry her through the candy-coated skies of Chocolata when she wished to soar. Chocoletta's form, like her spirit, was one of constant evolution. She would refine her design depending on her mood or the occasion, always representing the joyful combination of a chocolatier's discipline and an artist's boundless imagination. Her shape was a testament to the rich culture and heritage of the Chocolians—a visual symphony of the beauty that could be wrought from the universal language of chocolate."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

The position of King of Korea still exists and Korea is a kingdom de-jure, but the Japanese revive the pre-Joeson Goryeo Kingdom as the local governance of post-Joeson Korea as a Japanese province. In the aftermath of the victory over the Ming and the absorption of the Korean peninsula into Japan, the Japanese Imperial Family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, decides to use this opportunity to reclaim the power it [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] has [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] lost to the shoguns and the samurai class over the years and [ the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control of the Japanese government, essentially making Hideyoshi's roles of Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm into a position akin to the Prime Minister in Western European countries or the Reichkanzler in the Germanic lands while using the excuse of purging the newly claimed Korea of pro-Chinese Confucianist and neo-Confucianist elements, native Korean shamanism as well as the power of Korea's native aristocracy, the yangaban as well as freeing the mostly enslaved Korean population and making the Korean commoners long oppressed by both the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi into Japanese citizens during the integration of post-Joeson Korea into feudal Japan as a means of restoring the imperial system of government in Japan before the establishment of the feudal shogunates in a modern context, although the basic governmental style and social structures of the shogunate remain unchanged. Hideyoshi then replaces Confucianism and neo-Confucianism along with native Korean shamanism in post-Joeson Korea, with the Japanese state religion of Shinto, Buddhism and even Christianity, which mostly succeeds as the yangaban have been replaced with Japanese daimyō [feudal lord/s during Japan's feudal period under the shogunates |daimyō|] and the rediscovery of the native Korean Hangul script for writing the Korean language by the Japanese and its [Hangul's] promotion by the Japanese as the way of writing Korean over the Chinese script known as Hanja used by the now-deposed Joseon royal family and the Yangaban for writing in Korean with Nihongo [the Japanese language/Japanese |Nihongo|] and Kanji [the Chinese characters used to write Nihongo |Kanji|] also being promoted in post-Joeson Japanese Korea. By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession while ensuring that actual power in the Japanese government remains within the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. While this is going on Japan continues to improve and develop its [Japan's] firearms and artillery technology, [Japan] also continuing to improve its [Japan's] naval might while [Japan] solidifying the Ming dynasty's status as an unofficial Japanese vassal and satellite state in a reversal of the usual relationships between China and Japan through joint military exercises, suppression of bandits and would-be usurpers in Cantonia and the deportation of yangaban and Sinophilic House of Jeonju Yi members to Ming-controlled Han China The Tokugawa shogunate still maintains its position of isolation from the rest of the world, although this is challenged by the rise of the Jurchen tribes from Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and their subsequent conquest of China. The Japanese initially support the Ming in the fight against the Jurchens but realize that the conflict will eliminate anti-Japanese elements in China and so allow the Japanese to maintain power in East Asia. The Jurchens conquer much of northern China and even parts of Central China, establishing the Great Qing Empire while the rump state of the Ming becomes the Southern Ming, still under Japanese protection. The half-Japanese Zheng Sen, better known as Koxinga, still establishes the Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning on March 30, 1661 – February 1, 1662 in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, but since his [Koxinga's] mother, Princess Minamoto Matsu aka Tagawa Matsu is closer to her [Matsu's] family [Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty], the Kingdom of Tungning is a Japanese puppet state in all but name. Negotiations with the Qing end the conflict and so East Asia enters a new Three Kingdoms period: The Qing based in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Ming in Han China and the Japanese ruling over the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan and Okinawa. The Southern Ming conquers Indochina, using the opportunity to absorb the Vietnamese into the Han people and unfortunately totally genocide the Cantonese, Cambodian and Laotian peoples, absorbing the survivors into the Han Chinese.","completion":"Chapter VI: The Unification of East Asia under the Rising Sun The final years of the 16th century bore witness to a transformative period in East Asia's history. It was a time of conquest, realignment, and the emergence of Japan as a preeminent power in the region under the ambitious leadership of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whose vision for a unified realm extended beyond the shores of the Japanese Home Islands. Hideyoshi, ruling as the de facto leader of the Ashikaga Shogunate through his dual appointed roles, orchestrated one of the most significant military campaigns of the era, known as the Imjin Wars. Through it, he altered the centuries-old landscape of East Asian geopolitics. The conquest of the Korean peninsula was a matter of strategic and political significance. The campaign against the Kingdom of Great Joseon proved to be challenging, yet through sheer military prowess, and perhaps fortune's favor, Hideyoshi's forces subdued the vaunted defenses of the noble House of Jeonju Yi and their Ming allies. The resulting peace treaty signed in the imperial capital of Kyoto was a testament to Japan's newfound superiority. Joseon was annexed, its status as a distinct kingdom dissolved, and constituted into a province of the expanding Japanese realm. Hideyoshi, in a symbolic gesture of dominance, took Princess Jeongmyeong as his concubine, further tightening his grip on the former Korean royal lineage. The dissolved Kingdom of Joseon marked not only geographical expansion but heralded a shift in governance. The Imperial House of Great Yamato, seeing the confluence of a dismantled Korean nobility, an emboldened army, and the vast resources now flowing from the continent, seized the moment to reclaim lost authority. Empowerment of the emperor culminated in a restructured government, placing the emperor at its pinnacle—a quasi-restoration of power reminiscent of ancient ruling paradigms with modern sensibilities, though maintaining the societal rigidity synonymous with samurai culture. With the Korean peninsula now firmly within its grasp, Japan set forth on a radical campaign of integration. The Japanese sought to reinvent Korea, weaving it into the fabric of their culture and society. The native Goryeo Kingdom was revived in form, but as an administrative tool for Japanese oversight. The yangban, who had once stood as Korea's elite class, were supplanted by Japanese daimyo, reshaping the peninsula's power dynamics. The once-oppressed Korean commoners found themselves recast as Japanese citizens, a move calculated to break the lingering loyalties to the former Joseon status quo. Hideyoshi's reign saw the introduction of Shinto, Buddhism, and even Christianity to replace the traditional Confucian and shamanistic beliefs of Korea, alongside efforts to elevate the Hangul script over classical Chinese, integrating it with the teachings of Nihongo and Kanji. Following Hideyoshi's death, his nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu assumed his mantle, maintaining the centralized authority established under his uncle. The shogunal seat, however, faced contention, as Tokugawa Ieyasu, a daimyo of notable ambition, pushed against the Toyotomis' dominance. The Emperor Go-Yōzei wisely intervened, striking a balance by appointing Ieyasu as shogun, while entwining the destinies of the Toyotomi and Tokugawa lines through marriage. This deft political maneuver ensured the shogunate's continuity and the empire's stability under imperial oversight. Japan's ascendancy did not halt at mere territorial expansion but manifested in a military Renaissance, as the nation refined its mastery over gunpowery and seafaring. The subjugated Ming dynasty, downgraded to a satellite under assertive Japanese dominion, played a role in this martial evolution. Joint operations in Cantonese lands further ratified the dynamics of control, Japan acting as the austere overseer, prepared for external challenges that may arise. As the 17th century progressed, the rise of the Jurchen tribes in the region instigated a new era of conflict, posing a threat to the Ming; Japan initially supported the Ming but recognized the Jurchens as a natural crucible, one that would purge anti-Japanese elements within China. The resulting Great Qing Empire and the surviving Southern Ming, shadowed by Japanese might, accepted this new order of power-sharing in East Asia. Koxinga, a figure of mixed Sino-Japanese heritage, leveraged his maternal ties to the Imperial House to establish the Kingdom of Tungning as a loyal Japanese vassal. Japan, astutely playing the diplomatic field, averted further conflict, bringing peace to the region by conceding the rise of the Qing in Manchuria, while affirming its own influence over the Ming, Korea, Taiwan, and Okinawa. Under the weight of this new political reality, the Southern Ming embarked on a ruthless campaign in Indochina, an endeavor marked by cruelty and assimilation, eradicating distinct ethnicities in a dark bid to consolidate power. Yet, the scars of these atrocities would not discredit the profound impact of Japan's strategic and cultural achievements, which forever changed the tapestry of East Asian history."},{"prompt":"create a roleplaying fantasy scenario game where I play Rai, a 16-year-old boy mage who is the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. One during a gathering with my fans, the champion in the kids division, 11-year-old Lily, dares me to a match against her, but to even the playing field, I’d need to be the same age as her. I reluctantly accept, and agrees for her to regress me in age. She regresses me to the age of 10 in front of my fans. She then challenges me for one more dare, she’ll only return my age back to normal if I win the match, but if I lose, I’ll be left a kid and have to grow up anew. The regression has also affected my mentality so to not be seen as a coward, I foolishly accept, but only later realize what a stupid decision it was. I now have a week to prepare for the match where my fate will be sealed. After the regression I’m much weaker than before and forgot many of my advanced spells and Lily’s now slightly older than me. My mentality has also regressed. As a side effect to the regression, in the first week, I may regress slightly further during high stress situations, which will further reduce my abilities and confidence and prospect of winning the match. Random events may include Lily interrupting my training and trying to embarrass me, some former fans who are now older than me try to bully me, Lily invading my dreams at night to erode my confidence further. You can come up with more random events as we go along. I have only a limited time each day to train for the match, but regressing further may nullify my progress and set me back further. Potential additional regression can be of a few months up to a year per incident. Rai cannot regress further past the age of 6-years-old. After regressing, I’m moved from the teen dorms to the kids’ dorms. Additional characters: I have a younger sister who’s 8-years-old and she and her friends are fans of Lily.

Despite the random event, you must decide how you will start your journey back to full strength: 1. **Refine Basic Spells**: Focus on enhancing the spells you still have at your disposal, perhaps increasing their effectiveness or reducing the mana cost. 2. **Attempt Spell Recall**: Try to unlock the deeper mysteries of the advanced spells you once mastered, searching for the threads of memory that may help to bring them back to your grasp. 3. **Strengthen Mind and Body**: Invest in building up your mental defenses and physical agility, anticipating potential stressors that could lead to further unwanted age regression. Choose your training focus, and then we'll proceed to see what the random event is. To find out what kind of random event influences your training, roll a d20 again for the specific scenario. Let's begin your quest to regain your stature as the champion you are meant to be."},{"prompt":"I roll 1","completion":"With a roll of 1 for the random event, it seems that misfortune has decided to make an early appearance on your path to redemption. **Random Event: Stressful Regression** The pressures of your situation weigh heavily upon you, and the stress of not just the duel but of your altered life crisis triggers a further regression. Your attempts to focus on your training are interrupted by the gnawing anxiety about the upcoming match and what it means for your future. **Regression Roll:** To determine the extent of this setback, please roll the d20 once more. This roll will indicate how many additional months you regress. A low number means less regression, while a high number could significantly reduce your abilities and confidence further. Once we know the degree of regression, we can then move forward with your training approach in spite of this hitch. Roll the d20 and brace yourself, Rai; missteps may occur, but they are not the end of your tale. Your journey is about perseverance as much as it is about magical prowess."},{"prompt":"I roll 13","completion":"You roll a 13, which means that the stress-induced regression causes you to lose several more months—13 specifically. This shift in age brings you perilously close to the minimum age threshold, regressing you to just under 7 years old. Your body and mind adjust uncomfortably to this younger state, the process unsettling as memories become hazier, your hands tinier, and your magical ability diminished further. However, as a champion's spirit is not so easily quenched, you manage to push through the confusion and trepidation, determined to continue with your training. **Current Age: 6 years and 11 months** _(based on maximum allowable age regression to 6 years old)._ **Training Approach:** Even with this unfortunate downturn, your training must go on. You refocus on the task at hand, aware that despite your diminishment, the duel against Lily remains unchanged. Choose how you will proceed with your training under these new circumstances: 1. **Refine Basic Spells**: With the memory of higher-level spells now even further out of reach, concentrating on mastering the basic spells could be more important than ever. 2. **Spell Recall Attempt**: In defiance of this new challenge, you could stubbornly try to grasp the remnants of advanced spells that linger in your mind, though this could be more difficult given your regression. 3. **Strengthen Mind and Body**: Address the immediate need to prevent any further age regression and build up your physical capabilities to compensate for your smaller, weaker form. Despite being pushed back so significantly, the essence of who you are remains intact. Finding strength in this core identity, you prepare to face the trials ahead.

The position of King of Korea still exists and Korea is a kingdom de-jure, but the Japanese revive the pre-Joeson Goryeo Kingdom as the local governance of post-Joeson Korea as a Japanese province. In the aftermath of the victory over the Ming and the absorption of the Korean peninsula into Japan, the Japanese Imperial Family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, decides to use this opportunity to reclaim the power it [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] has [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] lost to the shoguns and the samurai class over the years and [ the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control of the Japanese government, essentially making Hideyoshi's roles of Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm into a position akin to the Prime Minister in Western European countries or the Reichkanzler in the Germanic lands while using the excuse of purging the newly claimed Korea of pro-Chinese Confucianist and neo-Confucianist elements, native Korean shamanism as well as the power of Korea's native aristocracy, the yangaban as well as freeing the mostly enslaved Korean population and making the Korean commoners long oppressed by both the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi into Japanese citizens during the integration of post-Joeson Korea into feudal Japan as a means of restoring the imperial system of government in Japan before the establishment of the feudal shogunates in a modern context, although the basic governmental style and social structures of the shogunate remain unchanged. Hideyoshi then replaces Confucianism and neo-Confucianism along with native Korean shamanism in post-Joeson Korea, with the Japanese state religion of Shinto, Buddhism and even Christianity, which mostly succeeds as the yangaban have been replaced with Japanese daimyō [feudal lord/s during Japan's feudal period under the shogunates |daimyō|] and the rediscovery of the native Korean Hangul script for writing the Korean language by the Japanese and its [Hangul's] promotion by the Japanese as the way of writing Korean over the Chinese script known as Hanja used by the now-deposed Joseon royal family and the Yangaban for writing in Korean with Nihongo [the Japanese language/Japanese |Nihongo|] and Kanji [the Chinese characters used to write Nihongo |Kanji|] also being promoted in post-Joeson Japanese Korea. By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession while ensuring that actual power in the Japanese government remains within the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. While this is going on Japan continues to improve and develop its [Japan's] firearms and artillery technology, [Japan] also continuing to improve its [Japan's] naval might while [Japan] solidifying the Ming dynasty's status as an unofficial Japanese vassal and satellite state in a reversal of the usual relationships between China and Japan through joint military exercises, suppression of bandits and would-be usurpers in Cantonia and the deportation of yangaban and Sinophilic House of Jeonju Yi members to Ming-controlled Han China The Tokugawa shogunate still maintains its position of isolation from the rest of the world, although this is challenged by the rise of the Jurchen tribes from Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and their subsequent conquest of China. The Japanese initially support the Ming in the fight against the Jurchens but realize that the conflict will eliminate anti-Japanese elements in China and so allow the Japanese to maintain power in East Asia. The Jurchens conquer much of northern China and even parts of Central China, establishing the Great Qing Empire while the rump state of the Ming becomes the Southern Ming, still under Japanese protection. The half-Japanese Zheng Sen, better known as Koxinga, still establishes the Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning on March 30, 1661 – February 1, 1662 in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, but since his [Koxinga's] mother, Princess Minamoto Matsu aka Tagawa Matsu is closer to her [Matsu's] family [Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty], the Kingdom of Tungning is a Japanese puppet state in all but name. Negotiations with the Qing end the conflict and so East Asia enters a new Three Kingdoms period: The Qing based in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Ming in Han China and the Japanese ruling over the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan and Okinawa. The Southern Ming conquers Indochina, using the opportunity to absorb the Vietnamese into the Han people and unfortunately totally genocide the Cantonese, Cambodian and Laotian peoples, absorbing the survivors into the Han Chinese.","completion":"Chapter VII: The Ascendance of Nippon and the Transformation of East Asia The closing years of the 16th century witnessed the resurgence of the Land of the Rising Sun under the leadership of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm. His unyielding ambition and military acumen bore fruit in a realm reshaped by the sword and the ink of treaties. The Imjin Wars, a contentious period that carved its bloody chapters into the annals of history, culminated not only in the subjugation of the Great Joseon and the humbling of the once-mighty Ming dynasty but also in the renaissance of Imperial power within Japan itself. Under the shadow of Hideyoshi's relentless campaign, the once sovereign kingdom of Joseon gasped its final breath, dissolving into the embrace of Japan as its newest province. The imperial court in Kyoto rejoiced as the Korean Peninsula, now stripped of its royal lineage, was rechristened, echoing the bygone era of the Goryeo Kingdom. Yet, beneath the veneer of political reorganization lurked the age-old machinations of the Japanese ruling elite, ready to exploit this triumph to tilt the balance of power within the homeland. Emperor Go-Yōzei, a figure once resigned to the ceremonial, sensed the auspices of change. In the aftermath of victory, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, also known as the Minamoto, seized upon the unrest and disarray amongst the samurai class, reasserting the Emperor as the paramount force in governance, relegating Hideyoshi's once dominant role to a mere primacy in administration akin to a Prime Minister. This savvy maneuvering by the throne, under the guise of societal reform and integration of the newfound Korean territories, set the stage for the revitalization of the Imperial system that had long been eclipsed by military regents. The transformation across the sea was equally radical. Princess Jeongmyeong, confined within the opulent walls of Hideyoshi's estate as a concubine, witnessed the systematic erasure of her homeland's cultural touchstones. The yangban aristocracy and native spiritual practices were supplanted by Japanese daimyō, acting as custodians over the land, with the Shinto and Buddhist teachings flourishing under their patronage. Intriguingly, Christianity too found fertile ground amongst the disenfranchised masses yearning for spiritual solace. The revival of Hangul, the native Korean script, under the guidance of Japanese scholars, marked a bittersweet resurrection of Joseon's cultural legacy, starkly juxtaposed with the imposition of Nihongo and Kanji. Hideyoshi, in his death throes, left behind a legacy of conquest and cultural metamorphosis, his lineage secured through Toyotomi Hidetsugu, and ultimately his son, Toyotomi Hideyori. Emperor Go-Yōzei, adroit in his political maneuverings, prevented the ascension of another military ruler, forestalling the resurgence of internecine conflict. Yet, it was the rise of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the ensuing entente with the Imperial house through strategic matrimony that forged a new era; the Tokugawa Shogunate dawned, with its power tethered to the throne through golden chains of marriage and lineage. Aflame with the savagery of gunpowder and the majesty of grand fleets, Japan fortified its sovereignty over the Korean Peninsula and etched a relationship with the Ming dynasty, transforming the ancient seat of Sinic civilization into a satellite under Nippon's vigilant eye. Yet, the rhythm of peace remained fragile, as rumbles from the north foreshadowed a new tumult on the horizon. Behemoths of the continent, the indomitable Jurchen tribes, coalesced under the banner of the Qing, disrupting the harmony of the region and threatening the dominion gained by Japan. Through calculated support of the Ming and eventual acquiescence to the rise of the Qing, Japan retained its prestigious position, cementing a tripartite balance of power. The Great Qing, with its heart in Manchuria; the Southern Ming, nestled under the protective wing of Japan; and the Nippon Empire, encompassing its archipelago, Joseon, and the outlying isles. Illustrious amid this interplay of kingdoms was the tale of Zheng Sen, lauded as Koxinga, the half-Japanese progeny who carved his maritime domain of Tungning, straddling the line between autonomy and vassalage. His maternal lineage to the Japanese throne assured his fidelity amidst the swelling tides of his burgeoning state. In the violent ripples of war, the Southern Ming reached across Indochina, assimilating diverse cultures into the vast Han continuum, casting a shadow on the existence of disparate identities. The cataclysm that followed saw the obliteration and subsequent absorption of Cantonese, Cambodian and Laotian peoples into the Sinic fold, a grim chapter written in blood and ambition. Thus, against the tapestry of a turbulent century, the final brushstrokes of destiny depicted a grand adjustment of regional powers. Japan's prescience in navigating the tumultuous waters of diplomacy and warfare heralded a new epoch in East Asian history—an era where the Land of the Rising Sun reached across the firmament, eclipsing the old order with the dawn of a modern sovereignty."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

One during a gathering with my fans, the champion in the kids division, 11-year-old Lily, dares me to a match against her, but to even the playing field, I’d need to be the same age as her. I reluctantly accept, and agrees for her to regress me in age. She regresses me to the age of 10 in front of my fans. She then challenges me for one more dare, she’ll only return my age back to normal if I win the match, but if I lose, I’ll be left a kid and have to grow up anew. The regression has also affected my mentality so to not be seen as a coward, I foolishly accept, but only later realize what a stupid decision it was. I now have a week to prepare for the match where my fate will be sealed. After the regression I’m much weaker than before and forgot many of my advanced spells and Lily’s now slightly older than me. My mentality has also regressed. As a side effect to the regression, in the first week, I may regress slightly further during high stress situations, which will further reduce my abilities and confidence and prospect of winning the match. Random events may include Lily interrupting my training and trying to embarrass me, some former fans who are now older than me try to bully me, Lily invading my dreams at night to erode my confidence further. You can come up with more random events as we go along. I have only a limited time each day to train for the match, but regressing further may nullify my progress and set me back further. Potential additional regression can be of a few months up to a year per incident. Rai cannot regress further past the age of 6-years-old. After regressing, I’m moved from the teen dorms to the kids’ dorms. Additional characters: I have a younger sister who’s 8-years-old and she and her friends are fans of Lily. I have a 16-year-old girlfriend who may not be enthusiastic about her boyfriend now being (and potentially remaining) a kid. Keep track of what spells I know, the stats of my abilities, and calculate actions with a d20. (I’ll make the rolls).","completion":"Welcome to the magical world of Eldoria, Rai! You are a 16-year-old champion mage, known far and wide for your prowess in the arcane duels. But now, you find yourself trapped in the body of a 10-year-old boy, your magic and mind both affected by an audacious challenge from a tiny but formidable rival, Lily, the kids' division champion. The stage is set for an encounter that might change the course of your life forever. --- **Character Sheet: Rai** *Age:* 10 (Originally 16) *Appearance:* A once confident teen, now a small boy with a mop of unkempt hair and a bewildered look. *Personality:* Clever and resolute, yet now carrying a mix of childlike innocence and confusion along with his original determination. *Spell Knowledge:* Due to age regression - Basic spells like \\"Spark,\\" \\"Shield,\\" \\"Mend,\\" and \\"Nudge\\" (a weak telekinesis). *Abilities:* - Magic Proficiency: 6/10 (regressed from a 9/10) - Confidence: 5/10 (Variable due to age regression and stress) - Adaptability: 7/10 **Inventory:** - A wand of Ashwood, attuned to Rai's original age, now slightly uncomfortable to hold. - A duelist's robe, now far too large, tripping him up occasionally. - Magical Duelist's Medal for teen division, shrunk to fit Rai's new size as a sad reminder of the stakes. **Scenario Rules:** 1. You will train for one week before the match against Lily. 2. You'll have a set number of hours each day that you can use for training (roll for training effectiveness). 3. Stressful situations or random events may cause further age regression, impacting abilities and spells. 4. Rai cannot regress past 6 years of age. 5. The outcome of actions will be determined by a d20 roll. You will inform me of the results. **Day 1: Acclimation** On rising, the reality of your new stature sets in as you tug on clothes that hang like curtains off your smaller frame. A daunting task lies ahead: not only do you need to train but also to maintain your composure to avoid further regression. Your schedule today: - Breakfast at the kids' dormitory (potential social stress) - 3 hours of morning training - Lunch and spells review with your mentor (a chance to regain some lost knowledge) - 2 hours of afternoon training - Free time (potentially stressful encounters) - Dinner and early bed **Random Events for Day 1:** 1. Chance encounter with Lily and her taunts. 2. Bullying by former fans who are now older. 3. An unexpected visit from your girlfriend. Let's start with breakfast. Head to the dining hall with trepidation in your young heart. Will you be able to maintain your poise among the younger mages, or will the whispers and stares be too much? **Action**: Roll a d20 to see how well you handle the pressure at breakfast. After the roll, describe your action and the outcome of the situation. Good luck, Rai. May your magic grow strong as the duel approaches, and your spirit grow resilient against the challenges that await."},{"prompt":"7","completion":"**Breakfast at the Kids' Dormitory** With a roll of 7, you find breakfast to be a challenging experience. The once familiar hall has transformed into a landscape of oversized tables and voraciously giggling children. You remember these meals being about strategy and magical theory, but now the conversations are about who could eat the most porridge and the newest tricks from the Great Magician Elbert's latest show. You manage to maintain some composure, but the whispers \\"Isn't that Rai? He's so little now!\\" sting more than you'd like to admit. Your confidence wavers, but you hold onto your maturity, avoiding any outward reactions that could further reduce your standing - or your age. Despite this, the strain of maintaining your dignity causes minor stress, so let's determine if this has any impact on your abilities or if you regress further. **Action**: Roll a d20 to evaluate the impact of stress on Rai's magic and age. Remember, once you've rolled, we'll interpret the result and proceed to your morning training. Regardless of the outcome, Rai, remember that this is just the first step in a week of recovery and preparation – you can still turn things around as you progress."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"**Stress Impact** With a roll of 4, the stress of breakfast causes a noticeable toll on you. As you finish your meal, attempting to ignore the stares and whispers, you can feel the fabric of your magic weaken further. It's subtle, but to a skilled mage like yourself, unmistakable. A spark of fear ignites within you as you sense a slight regression in both your age and magic proficiency. Let's determine the extent of the regression: **Spell Knowledge:** Your grasp on \\"Nudge\\" becomes shaky. While you can still cast it, the spell's strength and control have diminished. **Abilities:** - Magic Proficiency: Drops to 5.5/10 (from 6/10) - Confidence: Temporarily dips to 4/10 (due to the morning's events) **Physical Age:** You feel a bit lighter, a bit shorter – you've regressed by a couple of months, taking you closer to the cusp of being 10 years old but not quite there. Shaken but not defeated, you push through the morning to the training area. You can't afford to waste any time; each session is precious if you're to regain any ground before your match with Lily. The air is crisp, and the sunlight is warm – perhaps today's practice will prove to be a balm to your frayed nerves. **Morning Training** With three hours ahead of you, you focus on the spells you still hold onto. \\"Spark\\" for offense, \\"Shield\\" for defense, and \\"Mend\\" for utility. You decide \\"Nudge\\" will have to be put aside, as its reliability has waned. **Action**: Roll a d20 to see how effective your morning training is. Remember, the roll will determine the progress you make and if any spells or abilities see improvement."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"**Morning Training Outcome** With another roll of 4, your morning training session proves to be a struggle. Perhaps it is the stress of the breakfast incident, your dwindling confidence, or simply the challenge of adjusting to your younger self, but your spells come out weaker and less stable than you're used to. \\"Spark\\" fizzles out too soon, \\"Shield\\" can't endure even the lighter practice jolts, and \\"Mend\\" barely stitches small tears in the practice dummies' fabric. As you practice, your concentration falters, and you feel an unnerving sensation – the magic in your veins recoils like a startled animal, further evidence of your lessened abilities and perhaps even another slight regress in age due to the persistent stress and frustration. Let's determine the impact of the unsuccessful training: **Spell Knowledge:** Your mastery over \\"Spark\\" and \\"Shield\\" remains, but their power is notably diminished – about a 5/10 in efficacy. \\"Mend\\" is now more of a temporary patch than a proper fix, struggling to reach a 4/10 in effectiveness. **Abilities:** - Magic Proficiency: Remains at 5.5/10 (no further regression due to age, but no improvement either). - Confidence: Remains at a wavering 4/10, being unable to shake off the morning's difficulties. **Physical Age:** The stress from the training session causes a minor regression in age, bringing you closer to 9¾ years old rather than a full 10. Thankfully, you remain firmly in the realm of a 10-year-old's capabilities — albeit at the lower end. Despite the setbacks, you know you can't give in to despair. It's time to push through to your lunch and spells review with your mentor. Perhaps their guidance can help you reclaim some of your lost potency. **Mentor's Guidance and Spell Review** You sit with your mentor, a kind but stern wizard named Alden, who has been with you since the beginning of your magical education. Explaining your current predicament, you seek his advice and ask for help in restoring what knowledge you can. **Action**: Roll a d20 to see how effective the mentorship and spell review session is. The outcome will determine if you can regain some control and strength over your spells, potentially improving your abilities and confidence."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"**Mentor's Guidance and Spell Review Outcome** With a roll of 4, the session with your mentor, Alden, proves more challenging than you both expected. Alden recognizes the severity of the situation and tries to adapt his teaching methods to your now younger cognitive and magical capacity, but the progress is slow. You can see the concern etched on his weathered face as each attempt to draw out the power of your spells falls short of your usual standards. The diminished effectiveness of your magic leads to a feeling of stagnation rather than advancement, and by the end of the session, you're left with a mixture of frustration and a sinking realization that this journey back to your former prowess will be harder than anyone anticipated. **Spell Knowledge:** No significant improvement, your basic understanding remains intact but not strengthened. **Abilities:** - Magic Proficiency: Stays at 5.5/10 - Confidence: Drops further to 3.5/10 as doubts begin to eat away at you **Physical Age:** Thankfully, there is no further regression in age during this session – perhaps the presence of Alden and the sanctuary of a structured learning environment provided just enough stability. Alden gives you an encouraging pat on the back, seeing your struggle. \\"Rai, remember that magic is not just power, it's resilience. Your determination will be as crucial as your spells in the duel. Rest, then practice. You will find your way,\\" he assures before leaving you with thoughts to ponder. With the sun beginning its descent, you have 2 hours of afternoon training ahead, your last chance at improving for today. Will you specialize in honing a single spell or try to balance your time across all your known spells? It's time to shake off the morning's failures and push forward with renewed vigor if you can muster it. **Afternoon Training** Determined to not let the day's struggles be in vain, you approach the training grounds once more. **Action**: Roll a d20 to determine the effectiveness of your afternoon training. Your roll will reflect either an improvement in your magic proficiency and confidence or further stagnation."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"**Afternoon Training Outcome** With a consistent string of 4s, it seems that misfortune is shadowing you relentlessly today. During your afternoon training, you try to channel your energy into honing \\"Spark\\" and \\"Shield,\\" as these are going to be essential in the duel against Lily. Unfortunately, your spells continue to sputter and falter. The sparks you produce are weak and short-lived, and your shields crumble under even the gentlest incantations from your practice partners. As you watch younger mages around you casting with the effortless glee of youth, you can't help but feel a twinge of envy. Their magic flows brightly, a stark contrast to your own dimmed abilities. The weight of your predicament feels heavier with each failed spell, and you struggle to keep up the facade of confidence. **Spell Knowledge:** \\"Spark\\" and \\"Shield\\" remain at the same reduced level of effectiveness, and it seems you're unable to push past the block today. **Abilities:** - Magic Proficiency: Remains at 5.5/10 — no improvement, but at least no further regression. - Confidence: Takes another hit, dropping to a precarious 3/10. **Physical Age:** The stress of the unsuccessful afternoon session could lead to yet another age regression. **Action**: Roll a d20 to determine if the stress of an unproductive training has caused you to regress in age further. As the day draws to a close, you try to muster what little optimism you can. Remember, Rai, in the world of magic, a lot can change in a short time. With focus and perseverance, tomorrow could be the turning point you desperately need. Now, let's see if you've been able to maintain your age or if the day's setbacks have pushed you closer to a younger self."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"**Stress-Induced Age Regression** With a roll of 1, the day's unyielding challenges prove too much for your strained magical and mental defenses. As the afternoon shadows stretch across the training grounds, your spells growing ever more unreliable, the stress accumulates like a physical weight. In a disheartening moment, feeling utterly defeated, your body succumbs to a significant regression. A sudden wave of fatigue overwhelms you, and the world seems to grow larger around you. Your clothes now hang looser around your shrunken frame, and your wand feels awkward and heavy in your tiny hand. The whispers of your peers turn into concerned murmurs as it becomes apparent to all that Rai, the teen prodigy, has diminished yet further. **Physical Age:** You are now notably younger, regressing to the approximate age of 9 years old. This brings you not only below Lily's age but also reduces your stature and your already hampered spell-casting capabilities further. **Spell Knowledge:** In this new, younger state, \\"Mend\\" becomes nearly unusable, and \\"Nudge\\" slips away altogether from your grasp. \\"Spark\\" is more of a static charge now, perhaps enough to startle but not much of an offense, and \\"Shield\\" is a barely visible shimmer that dissipates on contact. **Abilities:** - Magic Proficiency: Drops to a worrying 4/10 - Confidence: Plummets to 2/10, as you are now not just figuratively but literally looking up to mages you once surpassed In this moment of vulnerability, you barely notice the training grounds emptying as the dinner hour approaches. You need to regroup, center yourself, and perhaps seek support. Yet the thought creeps in – if you can't manage to reverse this regression, what will become of your future, your relationships, and your identity? **Evening Reflection** As you return to the kids' dormitory for the evening, it's with a heavy heart. This isn't where you expected to find yourself, in more ways than one. Tonight, how you cope with this shocking turn of events will be crucial. After dinner, you have a choice – you can either try to reach out to someone for emotional support, possibly your girlfriend, despite the awkwardness of your youthful form, or you can choose to reflect alone and rest early to prepare for another day of training. **Action**: Roll a d20 to determine the quality of your evening and state of mind going into tomorrow. Remember, mental resilience is just as important as learning spells in your current situation."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"**Evening Reflection Outcome** With the roll of 1, the evening brings no respite from the day's trials. The attempt to connect with others during dinner falters; your voice, now higher and lacking its once-authoritative tone, fails to rise above the din of the kids' gleeful chatter. When you try to engage with your peers, you're met with a mixture of pity and awkwardness that only serves to further isolate you. Your mind, still partly that of a 16-year-old, reels at the bizarre reality you're trapped in. As frustration and embarrassment swirl within you, there's little room for the introspection and rest you desperately need. When the time comes to attempt contact with your girlfriend, the situation becomes more overwhelming. You hesitantly approach her, but the sight of her, as she remains the teenager she is, accentuates the dissonance between your past self and your current reality. You witness the complexity on her face, a mixture of concern, discomfort, and a clear struggle to adapt to the dramatic change in you. It becomes clear that conversing with her as you are now only deepens your sense of despair. She, too, is at a loss — her boyfriend is now a child, a stark and distressing change impossible to ignore. The conversation ends with awkwardness and unspoken fears hanging thickly in the air. You retire to bed early, wrestling with a tumult of emotions, your confidence scraping rock bottom at a meager 1/10. Sleep is fitful at best, as anxiety about the looming duel taints your dreams with visions of defeat and lifelong childhood. **Abilities:** - Magic Proficiency: Remains at a diminished 4/10 - Confidence: Hits rock bottom at 1/10. Despondence takes hold, but it's the darkness before dawn – there’s nowhere to go but up. The night is long and the challenges seem insurmountable, but dawn brings a new opportunity for renewal. Tomorrow is another day of training, and with it comes a chance for redemption and growth. Do hearts mend quicker than magic at this tender age, or is the old adage of \\"youthful resilience\\" a myth? Time, and your actions, will tell. For now, Rai, rest and recoup as much as possible. The tale of your return to power (or further regression) rests on the edge of a dice roll and the strength of a young mage's spirit."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"**Day 2: The Path of Resilience** As the first light of dawn begins to peek through the curtains of the kids' dormitory, you stir awake from a night of turbulent sleep. Despite the trepidation that fills you, knowing that the day might bring further difficulties, there's a small flicker of determination; a reminder of who you are – or who you were – and what you're fighting for. Today is a new day, Rai, and with it, a clean slate to start reversing the setbacks you've faced. **Morning Routine** You carefully dress in the now-loose robes that feel cumbersome on your small frame. Though your confidence is at an all-time low, you have not completely forgotten you are Rai, the Champion. Your hands might be smaller, your voice might be higher, but within beats the heart of a winner. Breakfast awaits, and with it, the first opportunity to begin rebuilding. **Action**: Roll a d20 for your breakfast encounter to see if you can manage the social stress better than yesterday. Following breakfast, you have the chance to refocus your morning training. The spells \\"Spark\\" and \\"Shield\\" are fundamental and could use more attention, or you might decide to take a different approach entirely. **Morning Training** Today's plan might include specific meditative techniques to strengthen your mental resilience or perhaps a new training method you recall from your earlier learning at a younger age. **Action**: Roll a d20 for your morning training outcome. We're looking to see if there's an improvement in your magical proficiency and confidence. **Mentor's Guidance** Once again, you'll have time to spend with Alden for a spell review and strategic advice. He's been pondering your predicament overnight and may bring new insights that could help. **Action**: Roll a d20 for the effectiveness of your time with Alden. A high roll could signify breakthroughs in reclaiming lost knowledge or improving spell execution. **Afternoon Training and Reevaluation** With the wisdom from Alden's guidance, you approach the afternoon with a slightly recalibrated strategy, aiming to regain what has been lost. **Action**: Roll a d20 to determine the success of your afternoon training. A successful session could help stop the regressions and bolster your standing among the other young mages. **Evening Activities** Will you attempt another conversation with your girlfriend, or might you seek solace in books and study? Perhaps there's another person or activity that could provide a spark of joy or comfort. **Action**: Roll a d20 to conclude your day and assess your overall state heading into the evening. Your resilience is being tested, but every challenge is an opportunity for growth. Now begin your rolls, Rai, and let's see how the weave of Eldoria's magic twists and turns with the fate of its young dueling champion."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

Computers from 1998 and those from 2004 offer a good representation of the rapid advancements in computer technology over a relatively short period in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Below are several areas in which the two would typically differ: 1. **Processor (CPU):** In 1998, many computers were using Intel Pentium II or Pentium III processors, with speeds ranging from 233 MHz to around 450 MHz. By 2004, the Pentium 4 was common, with clock speeds ranging from about 2 GHz to over 3 GHz, representing a significant increase in processing power. AMD was also competitive with its Athlon and later Athlon 64 processors. 2. **Memory (RAM):** A typical computer in 1998 might have come with 32 to 128 MB of RAM, whereas by 2004, 256 MB to 1 GB of RAM was standard, showing a substantial improvement in multitasking capabilities. 3. **Storage:** Hard drives in 1998 were much smaller, usually between 2 to 10 GB. By 2004, hard drives had increased considerably in capacity, featuring 80 to 250 GB or more, allowing users to store much more data including music, pictures, and video. 4. **Graphics Processing (GPU):** In the late '90s, many computers still used integrated graphics with minimal 3D capabilities, whereas by 2004, dedicated GPUs from companies like NVIDIA and ATI (now AMD) were more common, offering enhanced performance for gaming and professional applications. 5. **Operating Systems (OS):** In 1998, Windows 98 was the most prevalent operating system for PCs. By 2004, Windows XP had taken over, offering a more stable and user-friendly experience with improved networking capability. 6. **Optical Drives:** CD-ROM drives were the standard in 1998, but by 2004, DVD readers and writers had become commonplace, enabling users to read and create DVDs containing more data or video content. 7. **Connectivity:** USB 1.1 ports were just emerging in 1998, but by 2004, USB 2.0 ports were standard, offering much faster data transfer speeds for peripherals. Also, Ethernet and Wi-Fi for home internet connections had become more widespread by 2004. 8. **Portability:** Laptops in 1998 were bulkier, had shorter battery life, and were much less powerful than their desktop counterparts. By 2004, notebooks had become significantly slimmer, lighter, and more on-par with desktops in performance, increasing their popularity for mobile computing. 9. **Display Quality:** In 1998, CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitors were the standard. By 2004, LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors were becoming more affordable and popular, offering better image quality, a smaller footprint, and less eyestrain with increased screen sizes and better resolutions. 10. **Expansion and Ports:** The number and type of ports for expansion increased over time. While 1998 computers might have serial and parallel ports for connectivity, by 2004 these were being phased out and replaced by more USB ports, as well as digital video interfaces like DVI. In essence, the nearly tenfold increase in processor speeds, significant increases in RAM and storage, the shift from CRT to LCD monitors, the development of more sophisticated operating systems, and the introduction of higher-speed connectivity options collectively transformed computers from 1998 to 2004 into much more powerful and user-friendly systems."},{"prompt":"What Does An Stock Market Ticker From 1966 Feature?","completion":"In 1966, the term \\"stock market ticker\\" referred to a telegraphic machine used to relay stock prices and other financial information across a network from the stock exchange to subscribers, typically broker offices and other financial institutions. The technology for stock tickers dates back to the late 19th century and evolved over time. A stock market ticker from 1966 would feature the following characteristics: 1. **Ticker Tape:** The device printed information on a long strip of paper known as ticker tape. The tape showed abbreviated company symbols followed by the latest trading price and volume for that stock. 2. **Character Limit:** The symbols for companies were limited to 1-4 characters due to the mechanical and bandwidth limitations of the time. 3. **Price and Volume:** Alongside the stock's ticker symbol, the device would print the price and the number of shares traded during the last transaction. For example, a typical ticker tape reading might show \\"IBM 22.5s10,\\" signifying that IBM shares were traded at 22.50 per share for the last lot of 10 shares. 4. **Time Delay:** There could be a delay from when the trade was made on the exchange floor to when it was printed on the ticker tape, as the information relay process was not instantaneous. 5. **Continuous Operation:** The stock ticker was designed to operate continuously during trading hours, constantly printing updates as trades were made on the exchange floor. 6. **Noise**: These machines were mechanical and could be quite noisy as they printed out the transaction data on the paper tape. 7. **Limited Information:** The amount of data provided on a 1966 stock ticker was limited to basic transactional information. It did not provide comprehensive data like bid/ask prices, high/low prices of the day, or other financial metrics that are common in today's digital tickers. 8. **Transmission via Telegraph Lines:** Data was transmitted through telegraph lines, which were sometimes affected by weather and other outside factors that could cause delays or interruptions in the service. 9. **Physical Delivery:** As the ticker tape was printed, it would literally spill out of the machine onto the floor, and brokers or their assistants had to read the tape and disseminate information as needed. This created a physical record of transactions that occurred throughout the day. By the late 1960s, electronic information displays began to replace physical ticker tape machines as computer technology started to enter the world of finance. Subsequent technological developments have made the stock market more accessible and transparent, with real-time digital tickers becoming ubiquitous on television networks, the internet, and mobile devices."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

The white-haired, red-eyed, soft-spoken and easily-scared but calm and determined time-manipulating young orphan girl Eri from Boku no Hero Academia is [Eri in this story] in fact Hiashi's distant descendant [Eri in this story] from one of his [Hiashi's] many one-night stands, marriages, lovers and concubines under the many aliases he [Hiashi] has [Hiashi] had over the years and so when he [Hiashi] hears her [Eri's] psychic cry for help from her [Eri's] current state of imprisonment from the branch of the Shie Hassaikai [Eight Precepts of Death |Shie Hassaikai|] Yakuza organization [Boku no Hero Academia], he [Hiashi] decides to rescue her [Eri], wiping out the Shie Hassaikai and [Hiashi] leaving no presence of its [Shie Hassaikai's] existence, although he [Hiashi] does take the Shie Hassaikai's leader, the sociopathic, Quirk and Hero hating, determined and cunning but also delusional, black-haired and amber-eyed Chisaki Kai's [Boku no Hero Academia] Quirk [Boku no Hero Academia], Overhaul, which [Overhaul] allows Kai the ability to disassemble anything he [Kai] touches, as well as reassemble it [the matter Kai touches] in any configuration he [Kai] desires, [Overhaul's matter manpulation ability] effectively giving him [Kai] full control over the matter [that comes into contact with Kai], [Hiashi taking Overhaul from Kai] before [Hiashi] taking his [Kai's] memories and [Hiashi] subsequently killing him [Kai], [Hiashi after rescuing Eri] rewriting her [Eri's] memories so that she [Eri] will [Eri] have no memory of her [Eri's] captors [the Shie Hassaikai] and [Hiashi after rescuing Eri from the the Shie Hassaikai] taking her [Eri] home with him [Hiashi] passing her [Eri] off as a street child [Eri in Hiashi's story] that he [Hiashi] adopted to his [Hiashi's] wife [Inko] and [Hiashi's] son [Izuku], which they [Inko and Hiashi] surprisingly buy, with Inko seeing Eri as her [Inko's] own daughter and Izuku getting used to [Izuku] having a little sister [Eri]. The female Katsuki in this story has strong feelings for Izuku in this story that she [the female Katsuki's in this story] hides [the female Katsuki's in this story's feelings] by acting tough, although he [Izuku] is [Izuku] obviously clueless about this [the female Katsuki's in this story's] obvious feelings for him [Izuku]. Eri is three years younger than [who is three years older than Eri in this story] him [Izuku] and [Eri in this story] loves him [Eri] deeply to the point of [Eri in this story] wanting [Eri in this story] to [Eri in this story] be his [Izuku's] loving wife [future Eri in her |Eri's| mind] and [Eri in her mind] subsequently mother his [Izuku's] children, which [Eri's deep feelings for him] he [Izuku] is [Izuku in this story] obviously clueless about. The female Katsuki in this story is also partially Russian-Jewish, partially German and partially American on the maternal side of her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] family, with her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] American name being Claire Harvey [Handoreddo], the heiress [Claire] of [what Claire is |Claire| next in line |Claire| to |Claire| inherit] the powerful American financial, economic, industrial and technological power known as the Harvey family [Handoreddo], whom [the Harveys] created and [the Harveys] control the massive industrial, technological, industrial and economic megacorp known as Warslan Enterprises [Handoreddo], which [Warslan Enterprises] created the Century Armaments and [Warslan Enterprises] is [Warslan Enterprises] the primary sponsor [Warslan Enterprises] of the Slayers [Handoreddo], with Claire being [what Claire is] a rather strong Slayer [Handoreddo] herself [Claire] despite her [Claire's] status as the Harvey heiress [Claire's true self]. Despite this Claire chooses to live in the surviving Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku in this story as Katsumi [the female Katsuki's in this story's Japanese first name] in order to rise to the top of the Nihon-jin Hero system and then [Claire as Katsumi] marry Izuku as his [Izuku's] wife [future Claire in her |Claire's| mind]. Unknown to everyone, Eri is [what Eri also is in this story] also a Variant [Handoreddo] along with [Eri in this story] also being [Eri in this story] part-Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] herself [Eri in this story] from a foul Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contract, [Eri in this story] now being [what Eri now is in this story] the human form [Eri in this story] of the God of trickery, deception and cunning in Norse mythology Loki after [Eri in this story] absorbing him [Loki in this story] into herself [Eri in this story] after he [Loki in this story] tried to take over her [Eri's] body and [Loki in this story] failed, [Loki's failed possession of Eri] leading to her [Eri in this story] gaining all of his [Loki's] powers, skills and abilities along with the ability to also form a contract with a human as a Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō]. The excerpt should start off with Izuku successfully killing his [Izuku's] daily Quota of Savages [Handoreddo] with the help of his [Izuku's] Variant [Handoreddo] abilities that [Izuku's Variant abilities] he [Izuku] successfully keeps hidden, [Izuku after killing the Savages] sneaking off the battlefield and to the local Warslan Enterprise branch after [Izuku] changing into civilian clothing, [Izuku] handing over the recorded proof of him [Izuku] slaying the Savages to the lady at the desk and [Izuku] collecting his payment for his [Izuku's] work as a Slayer [Handoreddo] before [Izuku] heading back to his [Izuku's] room at the UA dorm, only to find Eri in his [Eri's] dorm room changing. [Izuku] blushing in embarrassment, [Izuku] quickly closes the door and [Izuku] looks around, [Izuku] waiting a few minutes before [Izuku] reentering, only to see her [Eri] in [what Eri is currently wearing] a rather beautiful, flowing formal white dress that [Eri's white dress] emphasies her [Eri's] now-rather large bust and her [Eri's] developing curves, which causes him [Izuku] to blush. After [Izuku] closing the door and [Izuku] getting back inside, he [Izuku] asks her [Eri] what she [Eri] is [Eri] doing here [U.A] to which she [Eri] replies that she [Eri] is simply here [at UA] to support him [Izuku] in more ways than one. Eri then states that she [Eri] knows about him [Izuku] being both a Variant [Handoreddo] and a Slayer [Handoreddo], [Eri] revealing that she [Eri] is [Eri] also a Variant [Handoreddo] with a Century Armament and [Eri in this story] wishes to be a Slayer [Handoreddo], so she [Eri] disguised herself [Eri] as a boy and [Eri] joined U.A as a student in order to [Eri] be close to him [Izuku] and [Eri] sign up for the Slayer [Handoreddo] course at U.A. Eri also reveals that the virus that creates Variants can be suppressed by exchange of saliva, in other words passionate kissing, which causes him [Izuku] to blush in embarrassment as she [Eri] clings tightly to him [Izuku]. The next day at the U.A Sports Festival, Claire [Handoreddo] finds herself [Claire] forced to reveal the Century Armaments [Handoreddo] to the global public, although she [Claire] manages to get inside her [Claire's] future husband's [Izuku's] team during the obstacle course and tug of war events, [Claire] making sure he [Izuku] is [Izuku] as close to her [Claire] as possible. Eri in her [Eri's] disguise as a male U.A student, [Eri disguised as a guy] also [Eri disguised as a guy] manages to get into his [Izuku's] team, although she [Eri] uses Loki's powers to create a clone of herself [Eri] in her [Eri's] male disguise during the one on one battles while [Eri] staying in the audience in her [Eri's] true female form. During the battle between Izuku and the tall, slender but somewhat muscular, indigo-haired and purple-eyed, mind-control-Quirk having, stoic, brilliant and academically gifted and straightforward but conversational Support Course student at UA Shinsō Hitoshi [Boku no Hero Academia], Izuku uses his [Izuku's] training in [what Izuku is |Izuku| trained in] Ken'do [the way of the sword/sword way |Ken'do/Kendo/Kendō|, a traditional Nihon-jin style of fencing |Kendo| with |what is used to fight in Kendo| a two-handed wooden sword known as |the name of the two-handed wooden sword used in Kendo| a bokken, {Kendo} derived |Kendo| from |where Kendo originated from| the fighting methods of the ancient samurai], Ruuchuu Kobudō [old martial way of Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu |Ruuchuu Kobudō|, a Nihon-jin hand-weapon art |Ruuchuu Kobudō| that |what happened to Ruuchuu Kobudō| originated |Ruuchuu Kobudō| in |where Ruuchuu Kobudō originated in| Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu and |Ruuchuu Kobudō| utilizes |what Ruuchuu Kobudō utilizes| the kon |six foot staff|, sai |three-pronged truncheon|, tonfa |handled club|, kama |sickle|, and nunchaku |two rope- or chain-connected sticks|, but also |what other weapons are used in Ruuchuu Kobudō apart from the kon, saim tonfa, kama and nunchaku| the tekko (knuckledusters), tinbe-rochin (shield and spear), and surujin (weighted chain), with |what else happens in Ruuchuu Kobudō| its |Ruuchuu Kobudō's| CQC |close quaters combat|/hand to hand combat side being |what Ruuchuu Kobudō's CQC's/hand to hand combat side is| Shorin-ryu tode |Shorin Style/Shorin-ryu karate/China hand {Shorin-ryu tode}|, which |Shorin-ryu tode| is |what Shorin-ryu tode is| a system |Shorin-ryu tode| of |what is a system of| tode, |China Hand (tode)|, also |tode| known |tode| as |the other name of tode| karate |empty hand(karate)| in |where tode is |tode| known |tode| as karate| the Nihon Hondo and |where else apart from the Nihon Hondo tode is (tode) known (tode) as karate in| the Western World, which |tode/karate| is |what tode/karate is| a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system |tode/karate| of |what tode/karate is (tode/karate) a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system (tode/karate) of| unarmed combat |tode/karate|, which |tode/karate| focues |tode/karate| on |what tode/karate focuses on| delivering |tode/karate| sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to |where tode/karate focuses |tode/karate| on delivering sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to| pressure-sensitive points on the body, |Shorin-ryu tode being (Shorin-ryu tode) a system (Shorin-ryu-tode) of tode| that |Shorin-ryu tode| utilizing |what Shorin-ryu tode utilizes| swift, fast techniques based on |what Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on| the strategy of |what the strategy Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on is| simultaneously evading an enemy's attacks and |what else simultanously happens when using Shorin-ryu tode in battle apart from evading enemy strikes| attacking senstive spots of the enemy's body during battle], Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|], and jūjutsu [gentle art | jūjutsu| a Nihon-jin martial art |jūjutsu| that |what jūjutsu is| focuses |jūjutsu| on |what jūjutsu focuses on| striking, kicking, grappling and wrestling that |jūjutsu| can |what can happen to jūjutsu| be || used |jūjutsu| to |what jūjutsu can (jūjutsu) be (jūjutsu) used (jūjutsu) to do| kill or disable an opponent in combat to [Izuku during the fight] utterly dominate Hitoshi, causing Eri to cheer from the stadium and Claire to smile in happiness.

The battlefield quieted, the scent of ionized air lingering after the swift carnage. Sweat slicked his forehead as he sheathed his blade, his mind already racing ahead to his next task. Slipping into civilian clothing, he darted across town, nimble and undetected. At the Warslan Enterprise branch, Izuku's pace didn't falter as he presented his proof of victory. The receptionist, a demure woman in a suit that seemed too tight around her chest, offered a professional smile as she processed his earnings. \\"Efficient as always, Mr. Midoriya,\\" she said, her eyes flicking down to his muddy boots and back up to meet his gaze. A curt nod was all he offered before heading back to U.A's dorms, his thoughts a whirlwind of plans and secrets kept. He opened the door to his room to find Eri in a state of undress, causing his face to flush. He apologized profusely before stepping out, raking a hand through his green locks. When he reentered, Eri had clothed herself in an elegant white dress that somehow accentuated a form far more mature than her years warranted. Izuku managed a steadying breath, forcing himself to meet her gaze. \\"What are you doing here, Eri?\\" he asked, trying to keep his voice level. Her reply was a soft giggle, one that did little to ease the tension. \\"I'm here to support you, in more ways than one, Izuku.\\" Izuku's mind spun. Had his cover been blown? He clenched his fists to stop the tremor in his hands. \\"Relax, I know about you being a Variant and a Slayer. I am too,\\" Eri revealed, stepping forward to loop her arms around his neck. \\"And I've infiltrated U.A to stay close to you. You're not alone in this.\\" Izuku opened his mouth to respond, but the words died as Eri continued. \\"We can suppress the virus through exchange of saliva...\\" she murmured, her breath tickling his ear. His face heated at the implication, every instinct screaming at him to step back, yet he remained frozen. The following day, the U.A Sports Festival became the stage for hidden truths to unravel. Claire managed to flaunt her Century Armament to the world under the guise of competing alongside Izuku. But as the event unfolded, Izuku's focus was entirely on his combat with Shinsō Hitoshi. The two clashed, an intricate dance of Ken'do and Ruuchuu Kobudō against mind-control. Izuku dominated the bout, his use of Onmyōdō mysticism and jūjutsu precision turning the tide in his favor. Eri, both in her male disguise and true form, cheered from the stands, her voice joining the rally of support. Claire, standing close enough to brush his arm with hers, wore a proud smile that only widened as she witnessed his martial prowess. But the festival was not just a showcase for Izuku. It became a battlefield for affection, shared glory, and the revealing of true strength. Ochako, adorned in her armored Shenlong IS unit, wielded her gravity manipulation and the blade arts of her heritage to decisively overcome Mirio. Her ecstatic bounce and jubilant call for Izuku's attention sent the stadium into a frenzy. Claire and Momo's duel became a mesmerizing spectacle, their jiggling assets distracting many as they demonstrated the might of their enhanced abilities and centuries-old martial arts incorporated into their Soul Armors. Caught in the crossfire of affection and rivalry, Izuku could only forge onward, knowing that each victory brought the truth closer to light. The merging of worlds and lives may be unknown to the masses, but for Izuku and the women entwined in his destiny, it was merely another challenge they would face together – in a world far more fantastic and treacherous than anyone could fathom. --- Note: This excerpt attempts to hybridize the various genres and histories, yet considering the vast array of crossovers and the depth of each individual series mentioned, the above passage is but a mere snapshot, capturing a flavor of the overall concept you've requested."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt of a intresting, riveting, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, action-packed, martial-arts combat filled, science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, science-fantasy, martial arts, military-techno-thriller, suspense, action novel in the form of a Japanese fantasy night novel-style, Chinese wuxia/cultivation style, Japanese harem manga, anime, light-novel and visual novel-style, romantic-comedy, slice of life crossover between the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, manga, anime and video game franchise, the Handoredd [Hundred |Handoredd|] light novel, manga and anime franchise, the Hyakka Ryōran Samurai Gāruzu [Hundred Flowers Samurai Girls/Samurai Girls of a Hundred Flowers/Hundred Flower Samurai Girls |Hyakka Ryōran Samurai Gāruzu|] light novel, manga and anime franchise, the Handoreddo [Hundred |Handoreddo|] light novel, manga and video game franchise, the Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō [Magika Swordsman and Summoner |Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō|] light novel and manga franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Boku no Hero Academia [My Hero Academia |Boku no Hero Academia|] manga, anime and video game franchise, the Haiyore!

Izuku's father, the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possesive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia], who [Hiashi] is [Hiashi] in fact [Hiashi's true identity] the post-Quirk emergence Nihon-jin criminal underworld supreme leader and crime boss known only by his [Hiashi's] Quirk name [All for One], which his [Hiashi's] current legal wife and Izuku's mother, the short, slender and petite but somewhat curvy and buxom, reserved, soft-spoken and somewhat quiet but also determined, head-strong and focused with a weak telekinesis Quirk Midoriya Inko nee Shimura [Boku no Hero Academia] along with his [Hiashi's] son [Izuku] and [Hiashi's] legal heir [Izuku], [Inko and Izuku] being [what happens to both Inko and Izuku] clueless [Inko and Izuku] about [what Inko and Izuku both |Inko and Izuku| don't know] his [Hiashi's] true occupation [ruling the Japanese criminal underworld, [Hiashi] never encounters [whom Hiashi never encounters] the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, skinny and slender half-American, determined and soft-spoken but also focused with a Quirk that boosts his strength, speed and agility and is passed down from user to user Toshinori Yagi [Boku no Hero Academia], who [Yagi] is [what Yagi is] the Number 1# Nihon-jin Hero in his [Yagi's] Hero persona All Might [Boku no Hero Academia], [Hiashi never meeting All Might] and thus [Hiashi] never fighting him [All Might] the day after Izuku's Quirk test when he [Izuku] is [how old is Izuku when he |Izuku| takes a Quirk test] only four, thus allowing him [Hiashi] to be involved in his [Hiashi's] family's [Inko's and Izuku's] life as he [Hiashi in this story] never has to waste time fixing his [Hiashi's] face and body, although he [Hiashi] secretly gives his [Hiashi's] son [Izuku] a combined pyrokinesis [fire manipulating |pyrokinesis|] and telekinetic quirk after he [Hiashi] hears his [Hiashi's] beloved wife [Inko] crying about their [Hiashi's and Inko's] beloved baby boy [young Izuku] is [young Izuku] Quirkless [Boku no Hero Academia] the day after the Quirk test, with this [Izuku suddenly gaining a Quirk after the Quirk test] means that Izuku and the blonde-haired, red-eyed, short and slender but muscular explosive sweat-Quirk having, proud and arrogant Bakugō Katsuki [Boku no Hero Academia], [Izuku and Katsuki] remain friends [Izuku and Katsuki] in this story, although Katsuki in this story is [what Katsuki is in this story] female [Katsuki in this story] with a rather slim and slender but also curvy and rather buxom build, as well as [the female Katsuki in this story] having [what the female Katsuki has in this story] her [the female Katsuki's in this story] blonde hair grown long and in drill-style twintails, [the female Katsuki's hair in this story] being down to her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] heels and [the female Katsuki in this story] is [the female Katsuki in this story] a kitsune [fox |kitsune|] monmosu [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] and [the female Katsuki in this story also being] a Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contracter, with her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] being the Norse goddess of love, war and fate Freyja [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō]. The white-haired, red-eyed, soft-spoken and easily-scared but calm and determined time-manipulating young orphan girl Eri from Boku no Hero Academia is [Eri in this story] in fact Hiashi's distant descendant [Eri in this story] from one of his [Hiashi's] many one-night stands, marriages, lovers and concubines under the many aliases he [Hiashi] has [Hiashi] had over the years and so when he [Hiashi] hears her [Eri's] psychic cry for help from her [Eri's] current state of imprisonment from the branch of the Shie Hassaikai [Eight Precepts of Death |Shie Hassaikai|] Yakuza organization [Boku no Hero Academia], he [Hiashi] decides to rescue her [Eri], wiping out the Shie Hassaikai and [Hiashi] leaving no presence of its [Shie Hassaikai's] existence, although he [Hiashi] does take the Shie Hassaikai's leader, the sociopathic, Quirk and Hero hating, determined and cunning but also delusional, black-haired and amber-eyed Chisaki Kai's [Boku no Hero Academia] Quirk [Boku no Hero Academia], Overhaul, which [Overhaul] allows Kai the ability to disassemble anything he [Kai] touches, as well as reassemble it [the matter Kai touches] in any configuration he [Kai] desires, [Overhaul's matter manpulation ability] effectively giving him [Kai] full control over the matter [that comes into contact with Kai], [Hiashi taking Overhaul from Kai] before [Hiashi] taking his [Kai's] memories and [Hiashi] subsequently killing him [Kai], [Hiashi after rescuing Eri] rewriting her [Eri's] memories so that she [Eri] will [Eri] have no memory of her [Eri's] captors [the Shie Hassaikai] and [Hiashi after rescuing Eri from the the Shie Hassaikai] taking her [Eri] home with him [Hiashi] passing her [Eri] off as a street child [Eri in Hiashi's story] that he [Hiashi] adopted to his [Hiashi's] wife [Inko] and [Hiashi's] son [Izuku], which they [Inko and Hiashi] surprisingly buy, with Inko seeing Eri as her [Inko's] own daughter and Izuku getting used to [Izuku] having a little sister [Eri]. The female Katsuki in this story has strong feelings for Izuku in this story that she [the female Katsuki's in this story] hides [the female Katsuki's in this story's feelings] by acting tough, although he [Izuku] is [Izuku] obviously clueless about this [the female Katsuki's in this story's] obvious feelings for him [Izuku]. Eri is three years younger than [who is three years older than Eri in this story] him [Izuku] and [Eri in this story] loves him [Eri] deeply to the point of [Eri in this story] wanting [Eri in this story] to [Eri in this story] be his [Izuku's] loving wife [future Eri in her |Eri's| mind] and [Eri in her mind] subsequently mother his [Izuku's] children, which [Eri's deep feelings for him] he [Izuku] is [Izuku in this story] obviously clueless about. The female Katsuki in this story is also partially Russian-Jewish, partially German and partially American on the maternal side of her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] family, with her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] American name being Claire Harvey [Handoreddo], the heiress [Claire] of [what Claire is |Claire| next in line |Claire| to |Claire| inherit] the powerful American financial, economic, industrial and technological power known as the Harvey family [Handoreddo], whom [the Harveys] created and [the Harveys] control the massive industrial, technological, industrial and economic megacorp known as Warslan Enterprises [Handoreddo], which [Warslan Enterprises] created the Century Armaments and [Warslan Enterprises] is [Warslan Enterprises] the primary sponsor [Warslan Enterprises] of the Slayers [Handoreddo], with Claire being [what Claire is] a rather strong Slayer [Handoreddo] herself [Claire] despite her [Claire's] status as the Harvey heiress [Claire's true self]. Despite this Claire chooses to live in the surviving Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku in this story as Katsumi [the female Katsuki's in this story's Japanese first name] in order to rise to the top of the Nihon-jin Hero system and then [Claire as Katsumi] marry Izuku as his [Izuku's] wife [future Claire in her |Claire's| mind]. Unknown to everyone, Eri is [what Eri also is in this story] also a Variant [Handoreddo] along with [Eri in this story] also being [Eri in this story] part-Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] herself [Eri in this story] from a foul Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contract, [Eri in this story] now being [what Eri now is in this story] the human form [Eri in this story] of the God of trickery, deception and cunning in Norse mythology Loki after [Eri in this story] absorbing him [Loki in this story] into herself [Eri in this story] after he [Loki in this story] tried to take over her [Eri's] body and [Loki in this story] failed, [Loki's failed possession of Eri] leading to her [Eri in this story] gaining all of his [Loki's] powers, skills and abilities along with the ability to also form a contract with a human as a Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō]. The excerpt should start off with Izuku successfully killing his [Izuku's] daily Quota of Savages [Handoreddo] with the help of his [Izuku's] Variant [Handoreddo] abilities that [Izuku's Variant abilities] he [Izuku] successfully keeps hidden, [Izuku after killing the Savages] sneaking off the battlefield and to the local Warslan Enterprise branch after [Izuku] changing into civilian clothing, [Izuku] handing over the recorded proof of him [Izuku] slaying the Savages to the lady at the desk and [Izuku] collecting his payment for his [Izuku's] work as a Slayer [Handoreddo] before [Izuku] heading back to his [Izuku's] room at the UA dorm, only to find Eri in his [Eri's] dorm room changing. [Izuku] blushing in embarrassment, [Izuku] quickly closes the door and [Izuku] looks around, [Izuku] waiting a few minutes before [Izuku] reentering, only to see her [Eri] in [what Eri is currently wearing] a rather beautiful, flowing formal white dress that [Eri's white dress] emphasies her [Eri's] now-rather large bust and her [Eri's] developing curves, which causes him [Izuku] to blush. After [Izuku] closing the door and [Izuku] getting back inside, he [Izuku] asks her [Eri] what she [Eri] is [Eri] doing here [U.A] to which she [Eri] replies that she [Eri] is simply here [at UA] to support him [Izuku] in more ways than one. Eri then states that she [Eri] knows about him [Izuku] being both a Variant [Handoreddo] and a Slayer [Handoreddo], [Eri] revealing that she [Eri] is [Eri] also a Variant [Handoreddo] with a Century Armament and [Eri in this story] wishes to be a Slayer [Handoreddo], so she [Eri] disguised herself [Eri] as a boy and [Eri] joined U.A as a student in order to [Eri] be close to him [Izuku] and [Eri] sign up for the Slayer [Handoreddo] course at U.A. Eri also reveals that the virus that creates Variants can be suppressed by exchange of saliva, in other words passionate kissing, which causes him [Izuku] to blush in embarrassment as she [Eri] clings tightly to him [Izuku]. The next day at the U.A Sports Festival, Claire [Handoreddo] finds herself [Claire] forced to reveal the Century Armaments [Handoreddo] to the global public, although she [Claire] manages to get inside her [Claire's] future husband's [Izuku's] team during the obstacle course and tug of war events, [Claire] making sure he [Izuku] is [Izuku] as close to her [Claire] as possible. Eri in her [Eri's] disguise as a male U.A student, [Eri disguised as a guy] also [Eri disguised as a guy] manages to get into his [Izuku's] team, although she [Eri] uses Loki's powers to create a clone of herself [Eri] in her [Eri's] male disguise during the one on one battles while [Eri] staying in the audience in her [Eri's] true female form. During the battle between Izuku and the tall, slender but somewhat muscular, indigo-haired and purple-eyed, mind-control-Quirk having, stoic, brilliant and academically gifted and straightforward but conversational Support Course student at UA Shinsō Hitoshi [Boku no Hero Academia], Izuku uses his [Izuku's] training in [what Izuku is |Izuku| trained in] Ken'do [the way of the sword/sword way |Ken'do/Kendo/Kendō|, a traditional Nihon-jin style of fencing |Kendo| with |what is used to fight in Kendo| a two-handed wooden sword known as |the name of the two-handed wooden sword used in Kendo| a bokken, {Kendo} derived |Kendo| from |where Kendo originated from| the fighting methods of the ancient samurai], Ruuchuu Kobudō [old martial way of Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu |Ruuchuu Kobudō|, a Nihon-jin hand-weapon art |Ruuchuu Kobudō| that |what happened to Ruuchuu Kobudō| originated |Ruuchuu Kobudō| in |where Ruuchuu Kobudō originated in| Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu and |Ruuchuu Kobudō| utilizes |what Ruuchuu Kobudō utilizes| the kon |six foot staff|, sai |three-pronged truncheon|, tonfa |handled club|, kama |sickle|, and nunchaku |two rope- or chain-connected sticks|, but also |what other weapons are used in Ruuchuu Kobudō apart from the kon, saim tonfa, kama and nunchaku| the tekko (knuckledusters), tinbe-rochin (shield and spear), and surujin (weighted chain), with |what else happens in Ruuchuu Kobudō| its |Ruuchuu Kobudō's| CQC |close quaters combat|/hand to hand combat side being |what Ruuchuu Kobudō's CQC's/hand to hand combat side is| Shorin-ryu tode |Shorin Style/Shorin-ryu karate/China hand {Shorin-ryu tode}|, which |Shorin-ryu tode| is |what Shorin-ryu tode is| a system |Shorin-ryu tode| of |what is a system of| tode, |China Hand (tode)|, also |tode| known |tode| as |the other name of tode| karate |empty hand(karate)| in |where tode is |tode| known |tode| as karate| the Nihon Hondo and |where else apart from the Nihon Hondo tode is (tode) known (tode) as karate in| the Western World, which |tode/karate| is |what tode/karate is| a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system |tode/karate| of |what tode/karate is (tode/karate) a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system (tode/karate) of| unarmed combat |tode/karate|, which |tode/karate| focues |tode/karate| on |what tode/karate focuses on| delivering |tode/karate| sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to |where tode/karate focuses |tode/karate| on delivering sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to| pressure-sensitive points on the body, |Shorin-ryu tode being (Shorin-ryu tode) a system (Shorin-ryu-tode) of tode| that |Shorin-ryu tode| utilizing |what Shorin-ryu tode utilizes| swift, fast techniques based on |what Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on| the strategy of |what the strategy Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on is| simultaneously evading an enemy's attacks and |what else simultanously happens when using Shorin-ryu tode in battle apart from evading enemy strikes| attacking senstive spots of the enemy's body during battle], Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|], and jūjutsu [gentle art | jūjutsu| a Nihon-jin martial art |jūjutsu| that |what jūjutsu is| focuses |jūjutsu| on |what jūjutsu focuses on| striking, kicking, grappling and wrestling that |jūjutsu| can |what can happen to jūjutsu| be || used |jūjutsu| to |what jūjutsu can (jūjutsu) be (jūjutsu) used (jūjutsu) to do| kill or disable an opponent in combat to [Izuku during the fight] utterly dominate Hitoshi, causing Eri to cheer from the stadium and Claire to smile in happiness.

A white microbus runs over his foot","completion":"Your description is vivid and provides a clear visual concept for an artwork that combines elements of a Pixar-style cartoon with specific painting techniques and qualities. It seems like you're envisioning a piece that manages to have a minimalist yet striking aesthetic, applied to a dramatic scene. Here’s a breakdown of the elements in your prompt: 1. **Pixar Cartoon Painting**: This suggests that the style should reflect the type of animation associated with Pixar, which typically includes well-defined characters with some degree of realism and expressiveness. 2. **Dramatic, Powerful**: The tone should convey a sense of intensity and emotion, implying that the scene depicted should have a significant impact. 3. **Gouache-Inspired Flat Color Style**: This indicates that the colors should be vibrant and solid without gradations, reminiscent of gouache, which is an opaque watercolor medium known for its ability to layer. 4. **Solid Watercolor Layers and Expressive Ink Outlines**: The artwork should have the characteristics of watercolor, which typically includes a sense of transparency and fluid edges, but with the addition of expressive ink outlines that could add definition and drama to the piece. 5. **Minimalist and Bright**: The overall look of the piece should be simple, with clean lines and bright colors that stand out, avoiding excessive detailing or ornamentation. 6. **Portrait of Belal**: You’ve provided a detailed description of Belal’s features ensuring that any artist or illustrator could depict him accurately. 7. **Dramatic Scene**: The description ends with a white microbus running over the young man's foot, adding tension and an element of action to the composition. This prompt is well-suited to an artist or illustrator who is tasked with creating a visually compelling and emotive piece. Some potential considerations or questions for clarity: - **Intended use**: What is the purpose of the painting? Is it for a story scene, character concept, a poster, or any other specific use? - **Tone and Context**: How should the dramatic event be portrayed to convey the intended emotions? For instance, should the focus be on the character's reaction, the action of the incident, or both? - **Style Consistency**: Given the combination of a Pixar-inspired style with painting techniques like gouache and watercolor, the artist would need to balance these elements to ensure they work harmoniously together. - **Setting and Background**: Is there any specific setting or additional background details needed for the scene? Overall, your prompt is imaginative and offers plenty of direction for an artistic creation, though answering the above questions could help further refine the concept for the artist or illustrator."},{"prompt":"Can you improve the prompt depicting the moment where the microbus over Belal foot","completion":"Certainly! To improve clarity and emotional impact, we can enhance the prompt by adding more context, describing Belal's emotional reaction, and providing guidance on the composition and atmosphere you're envisioning for the moment. Here's a revised version of the prompt: --- Create a powerful and dramatic Pixar-inspired painting capturing the exact moment a white microbus runs over Belal's foot. In this artwork, Belal is a young man with a short black buzz cut curl hairstyle, full short beard, hazel eyes, bushy eyebrows, a round nose, and medium lips. Style: Utilize a gouache-inspired flat color palette, with vibrant solid watercolor layers that offer a minimalist yet bright aesthetic. Frame the composition with expressive ink outlines to add boldness and definition to the characters and the setting. Composition: Position Belal in the foreground, reacting to the sudden accident with a mixture of shock and pain on his face, ensuring his expression is the focal point. Capture the white microbus in the immediate background, its tire just making contact with Belal's foot. The microbus should appear in motion, perhaps with blurred wheels, to imply the action and urgency of the moment. Atmosphere: Despite the lighthearted, Pixar-esque character design, the scene should convey a sense of gravity and tension consistent with the dramatic theme. Use a stark contrast in lighting to highlight the area of impact and Belal's reaction, drawing the viewer’s attention directly to the critical moment. Tone: While the prompt suggests a serious incident, ensure the scene remains suitable for a wide audience, as is common in Pixar's storytelling style. The depiction should evoke empathy for Belal without becoming overly graphic or disturbing. Background: Include minimal but essential background elements to suggest an urban setting without cluttering the scene. Focus on the essence of the moment, using color and form to communicate the mood rather than detailed scenery. Narrative Detail: Add a subtle cue to suggest that Belal may be reacting not just to the pain but also to the inconvenience or implications of the injury, perhaps by having him hold something that now seems at risk of dropping or being forgotten in light of the accident. --- By expanding on the initial prompt, artists receive a clearer vision of the mood, setting, character response, and desired stylistic elements. This improvement aids in creating artwork that fully captures the intended dramatic and powerful moment."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the prompt after the improvement","completion":"Certainly! Here's the rewritten and improved art prompt reflecting the changes and additional details discussed: --- Create a captivating, Pixar-inspired piece that vividly captures the dramatic moment a white microbus runs over the foot of a young man named Belal. Belal is characterized by a short black buzz cut curl hairstyle, full short beard, hazel eyes, bushy eyebrows, a round nose, and medium lips. Artistic Style: The piece should emulate a gouache-inspired flat color style with solid watercolor layers, adhering to a minimalist and bright aesthetic. The artwork is to be outlined with expressive ink that adds emotion and emphasis to the scene. Composition Focus: Belal is the centerpiece of this tableau, foregrounded against the action. His face should express a potent blend of shock and pain, highlighting the intensity of the moment, while his body language suggests an instinctive, recoiled posture. Emotional Tone: Despite the colorful, cartoonish style, the atmosphere needs to maintain a serious undertone. Efficient use of stark lighting should spotlight the critical interaction between Belal's foot and the microbus tire, which is in the process of rolling over it. The bus should show motion blur, particularly on the wheels, to convey the abruptness of the situation. Context and Setting: Simplified urban elements in the background should set the scene without overwhelming the focal point. This could be hinted at with suggestive forms and colors that give a sense of place but do not distract. Narrative Element: To deepen the story being told, have Belal holding an item -- for example, a phone, a bag, or a drink -- that precariously dangles or appears seconds from dropping due to the unexpected accident, thereby adding a layer of consequence to the event. Note: While depicting a distressing moment, the illustration should remain appropriate for a general audience, similar to the balance struck in Pixar films, capturing empathy without graphic content. --- This improved prompt gives a well-rounded picture of what the final illustration should convey, combining emotional depth with a specific artistic style and balanced narrative detail."},{"prompt":"Make it short in the same format of the original text but with the added details: pixar cartoon painting.Dramatic,powerful.A gouache-inspired flat color style with solid watercolor layers and expressive ink outlines.

One during a gathering with my fans, the champion in the kids division, 11-year-old Lily, dares me to a match against her, but to even the playing field, I’d need to be the same age as her. I reluctantly accept, and agrees for her to regress me in age. She regresses me to the age of 10 in front of my fans. She then challenges me for one more dare, she’ll only return my age back to normal if I win the match, but if I lose, I’ll be left a kid and have to grow up anew. The regression has also affected my mentality so to not be seen as a coward, I foolishly accept, but only later realize what a stupid decision it was. I now have a 3 days to prepare for the match where my fate will be sealed. After the regression I’m much weaker than before and forgot many of my advanced spells and Lily’s now slightly older than me. My mentality has also regressed. As a side effect to the regression, in the first week, I may regress slightly further during high stress situations, which will further reduce my abilities and confidence and prospect of winning the match. Random events may include Lily interrupting my training and trying to embarrass me, some former fans who are now older than me try to bully me, Lily invading my dreams at night to erode my confidence further. You can come up with more random events as we go along. I have only a limited time each day to train for the match, but regressing further may nullify my progress and set me back further. Potential additional regression can be of a few months up to a year per incident. Rai cannot regress further past the age of 6-years-old. After regressing, I’m moved from the teen dorms to the kids’ dorms. Additional characters: I have a younger sister who’s 8-years-old and she and her friends are fans of Lily. I have a 16-year-old girlfriend who may not be enthusiastic about her boyfriend now being (and potentially remaining) a kid. Keep track of what spells I know, the stats of my abilities, and calculate actions with a d20.

As we begin our tale, Rai's knowledge and capabilities have been affected by the regression. Let's establish your character's current stats and known spells. You'll need a d20 to make your rolls and determine the outcomes of your actions. **Rai's Stats:** - **Intellect:** 10 (A reflection of your magical knowledge and ability to strategize) - **Power:** 8 (Representative of your magical strength and how potent your spells are) - **Dexterity:** 12 (Your physical agility and reaction speed in duels) - **Willpower:** 7 (Your mental resilience, important for resisting Lily's psychological games) - **Charisma:** 9 (Useful for interactions with others and gaining support) **Known Spells:** - Fireball: A basic offensive spell that conjures a ball of fire toward a target. - Shield: A defensive spell creating a barrier to block incoming attacks. - Levitation: A utility spell allowing you to lift small objects or yourself for a brief duration. - Fog Cloud: A spell to obscure vision, creating a dense fog in a small area. **Day 1 - Training Begins** You have three days to prepare. Today's goal is to recover your knowledge of advanced spells and improve your stats. However, you must be careful to manage stress to avoid further age regression. You plan to train in the following ways: 1. **Spell Practice:** Go through the motions and incantations of spells you remember to refine your control and hopefully trigger memories of more advanced spells you've lost. 2. **Physical Exercise:** To improve your dexterity and overall physical condition, which will also help you focus mentally. 3. **Meditation:** To strengthen your willpower and protect against mental attacks and stress-triggered regressions. **Roll a d20 for each training activity** to determine how successful you are at each. **Potential Random Events for Day 1:** 1. Lily interrupts your training, trying to humiliate you in front of others and erode your confidence. 2. Your sister’s friends, now looking down upon you as a younger kid, publicly pledge their allegiance to Lily. 3. Your girlfriend tries to visit you but is conflicted and unsure about how to interact with you now. At the end of each day, we will reassess your stats and spell knowledge based on the success of your training and the occurrence of any stress-induced regressions. If you experience such regression, you will roll a d6 to determine how many months back in age you regress, but remember, you cannot go back past the age of 6. Good luck, Rai.

The arcane gesture that should have shaped a Fireball spell instead sputters out a few harmless sparks, falling to the floor with a disappointing fizz. With the result being a critical failure, not only have you failed to recover knowledge of any advanced spells, but your already weakened magical prowess feels even less reliable. The high-stress failure of the practice session triggers a stress-induced regression. **Roll a d6 to determine how many months you regress in age due to the stress.** This unfortunate turn of events is a reminder of the gamble you've taken with your very being, and just how high the stakes are in the upcoming duel with Lily. The laughter of fellow trainees echoes mockingly in the room, and the pressure to regain your former strength intensifies."},{"prompt":"6","completion":"**Age Regression Roll: 6 (Maximum Regression)** The laughter and mocking jeers from your fellow trainees carry a weight far heavier than any physical blow. Your chest feels tight as the magic backfires, and a sudden wave of weariness washes over you. In an instant, those 6 months of maturity and growth you had retained after the initial regression vanish. You now stand in the practice room, the body and mind of a child just barely 9 and a half years old. Your once-confident grip on the arcane has weakened; your intellect has dulled and your raw power has diminished. The distance between you and Lily has grown further, as she retains her age advantage and her skillset. **Rai's Adjusted Stats:** - **Intellect:** 8 (You have a harder time grasping complex magical theories now.) - **Power:** 6 (Your magical strength has diminished, making your spells less potent.) - **Dexterity:** 11 (Still nimble, but a little less so due to the regression.) - **Willpower:** 6 (The mental resilience needed to combat Lily's psychological warfare has waned.) - **Charisma:** 8 (Your younger self is less capable at swaying others.) Your flubbed Spell Practice session has set you back significantly, Rai. But despair not—the day is not yet over, and there's still a chance to regain some ground. Consider altering your approach, as sometimes the most profound lessons come from failure. You still have Physical Exercise and Meditation scheduled for the day. You may now choose to either move on to the next training activity or address one of the random events that have emerged in response to your critical failure. What will you do next, Rai?"},{"prompt":"Physical Exercise.

You trip over your feet, landing hard on the ground in front of your peers. Murmurs and snickers spread through the room as some of the trainees witness your fall. Your embarrassment and stress levels escalate, feeling a far cry from the champion you once were. Given the critical failure, the stress of this moment has the potential to induce another regression. **Roll a d6 again to see if the stress of this event causes you to regress further in age.** This second critical setback is a harsh reminder that your young body and mind may not be as resilient as they once were. It's crucial now more than ever to find a way to center yourself and refocus if you hope to overcome the challenge that lies ahead. Your training is proving to be an uphill battle, and the pressure is mounting with the duel against Lily drawing closer by the minute."},{"prompt":"6","completion":"**Age Regression Roll: 6 (Maximum Regression Again)** The room spins lightly as another wave of magical regression washes over you. The giggles and whispers of the spectators seem to slow and distort as you visibly shrink, not just in stature but in presence. Standing up, you now look around through the eyes of a child just under 9 years old. Your physical coordination and mental acuity have slipped further from your grasp, making the challenge before you even more daunting. Disheartened but not defeated, you must press on, though the path to victory seems evermore like the realms of distant myth and legend. **Rai's Further Adjusted Stats:** - **Intellect:** 6 (Your understanding of magic is now basic at best, being so young.) - **Power:** 5 (With even less magical strength, your spells might be less effective than some of the beginner mages.) - **Dexterity:** 10 (Your coordination continues to suffer as you regress.) - **Willpower:** 5 (Your youthful mind struggles to cope with the stress and maintain focus.) - **Charisma:** 7 (It's increasingly difficult to inspire confidence in others when you are barely out of early childhood.) With two critical failures and maximum regressions, the day has been disastrous. As you dust yourself off and try to hold back tears of frustration, you realize that Lily's dare was more dangerous and cunning than you could have ever imagined. You still have Meditation on your schedule; perhaps focusing inward can help curb the stress and avoid any further regression. You also have the potential random events to address: Lily's taunts, your sister's friends rallying to Lily, or your girlfriend's conflicted visit.

In your agitated state, a surge of magical energy unintentionally escapes, sending a gust of wind that scatters nearby scrolls and training materials. The commotion attracts even more attention to your struggles, deepening the pit in your stomach. With yet another critical failure, the stress at this moment is immense, and it threatens to pull you even deeper into the throes of childhood. **Roll a d6 once more to determine if this third critical failure causes further age regression.** Three critical failures in a single day of training is unprecedented, and it's now more evident than ever that the challenge you face is a colossal one.

It’s becoming a sensation you dread, as once again, you find the world growing slightly larger around you. Your clothes hang looser about your frame; even your thoughts seem to blur around the edges, the complexities of magic fading further from your grasp. In a quiet moment of realization, you understand you're now just an 8-and-a-half-year-old boy. The gravity of your situation is pressing; your very identity as a mage champion is slipping through your fingers like grains of sand. **Rai's Desperately Adjusted Stats:** - **Intellect:** 4 (Complex spells are now beyond your comprehension; you are back to the very fundamentals.) - **Power:** 4 (Your magical output is weak, resembling that of a complete novice.) - **Dexterity:** 9 (You are small and might be agile for a child, but this doesn't help much in a duel.) - **Willpower:** 4 (Keeping your composure is harder than ever; you are easily upset or frightened.) - **Charisma:** 6 (You're struggling to be taken seriously by anyone at this point.) Three critical failures, three maximum regressions—the harsh reality that you might remain in this diminutive state looms over you. As the day comes to a close, you must consider your next steps with extreme care. The toll of these events on your mental state can't be ignored. The support of friends or mentors might be necessary to reclaim some semblance of control, to remember who you are beyond your years. You might choose to use the evening for quiet reflection on the day's lessons, or you could seek solace among any allies you still have. There might still be hope if you approach tomorrow with a new mindset or strategy, or if you find someone willing to help guide your now much younger self.

You find her among the older teens, casting anxious glances in your direction as you approach. Your small stature and youthful face starkly contrast with the other teenagers surrounding her. As you reach her, the expression on your girlfriend's face betrays a mixture of emotions—confusion, concern, maybe even a hint of frustration. When you speak, your voice betrays your anxiety, and your words come out less coherently than you intended, more akin to the babbling of a child than the conversation of equals. She tries at first to find the right words, but as those around you begin to chuckle or whisper, her embarrassment grows. Her voice rises sharply, scolding you for your recklessness in accepting Lily's challenge, her words coming out more harshly than she likely intends. It’s a reaction more befitting a caretaker admonishing a child than a partner offering support. Feeling small and scolded, you retreat from the encounter with your heart heavy. The stress of this interaction and the crushing disappointment don't bode well. **Roll a d6 to determine if this stress leads to another regression.** Your journey as Rai, mage prodigy reduced to a child, continues to spiral in a way that no tome or prophecy could have foretold.

As sleep comes to claim the weary and worried alike, you may have no choice but to rest and hope that the new dawn might bring a spark of the wisdom you once wielded. The night may be a time for dreams, or nightmares, but also for the quiet kindling of hope's fragile flame.

The game always takes place at night, only seeing some small glimpses of daylight before the final boss battle, which is back to being engulfed in darkness.","completion":"The setting you've described for your horror game provides a rich backdrop for unsettling storytelling and gameplay. A rust-belt town near New Jersey at night can offer a blend of industrial decay and urban legends, perfect for a horror experience. Here are some thoughts to help you flesh out the setting: 1. **Industrial Decay**: The rust-belt aspect can be visually compelling, with dilapidated factories, abandoned warehouses, and broken-down infrastructure. The sense of a once-thriving city now fallen into disrepair can add to the feeling of isolation and despair. The environment can play an active role in the game, with players navigating through hazardous areas, possibly with environmental puzzles that fit into the crumbling setting. 2. **Sound Design**: Since the game is always at night, sound design will be crucial. Sparse lighting will mean that often players will rely on auditory cues. The ambient noise of creaking metal, the echo of dripping water, distant machinery, or the howl of wind through empty streets can all contribute to a haunting atmosphere. 3. **Time Progression**: The fact that the game moves from perpetual night to a brief glimpse of dawn before the final boss battle could be symbolic. Perhaps that hints at hope or a resolution that is quickly snatched away as darkness engulfs the scene again, adding to the desperation of the climax. 4. **Environmental Storytelling**: Use the environment to tell the town's story. Graffiti, faded billboards, newspaper clippings blowing in the wind, or overheard snippets of conversation can provide backstory without explicit narration. 5. **Cultural and Historical References**: Midway might have a rich past, with references to local legends or historical events that play into the horror themes. This can create a deeper narrative layer for players to uncover. 6. **Enemy Design**: Consider what kind of enemies would inhabit such a place. Are they former residents twisted by some town secret? Are they creatures that thrive in the darkness of the decaying industrial landscape? Or perhaps, the enemies are a manifestation of the town's dying spirit itself. 7. **Survival Elements**: Limited resources would make sense in a deserted town. Scarcity of supplies can add tension and force players to make difficult decisions, enhancing the horror experience. 8. **Dynamic Weather**: Though the game takes place at night, changes in weather can still affect visibility and gameplay. Fog, rain, or even a storm can alter the mood and challenge the player in different ways. In this setting, you have ample opportunity to play with themes of urban decay, economic despair, and the haunting nature of forgotten places. Remember that the setting not only serves as a backdrop but can also act as a character within the game—one that is just as important as the protagonist or any monsters lurking in the shadows."},{"prompt":"The game takes place around 1996. The player starts in the woods after a car crash involving a big rig, before slowly going back to the city.","completion":"Setting your horror game in 1996 introduces a specific cultural and technological context that can have interesting implications for gameplay and atmosphere. Here's how you can expand on this setting: 1. **Technological Limitations**: In 1996, mobile phones were not as ubiquitous or advanced as they are today. GPS systems were not in common use, and the internet was still in its infancy in terms of public access. This can enhance the sense of isolation since the player cannot easily call for help or find their location online. 2. **Cultural Mood**: The mid-'90s had a unique cultural atmosphere. You could reference music, fashion, and events from that era to create a sense of authenticity. The grunge and alternative movements were significant, and a soundtrack inspired by the era could help set the mood. 3. **Staging the Car Crash**: Starting in the woods after a car crash establishes an immediate sense of disorientation and vulnerability for the player. The wreckage of their own vehicle, the ominous big rig, and the forest could serve as initial areas to explore. Environmental clues could suggest the reason for the crash or hint at darker forces at play. 4. **Journey to the City**: As the player moves from the relative quiet of the woods to the abandoned city of Midway, there's a natural progression of tension. The openness and potential for disorientation of the woods can be contrasted with tight, claustrophobic urban environments that may harbor unseen threats. 5. **Physical and Psychological Horror**: Utilize the transition from the woods to the city to switch between types of horror. The woods can be more about fear of the unknown and being stalked by something unseen, while the city can have more psychological horror elements, with the decrepit surroundings playing on the player's nerves and possibly hallucinatory experiences reflecting the protagonist's mental state after the crash. 6. **Non-Linear Exploration**: Depending on how you structure your game, as the player approaches the city, you might offer different paths or areas to explore, like suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts, commercial districts, or the industrial zones—even potentially looping back to the woods as players uncover more of the story. 7. **City's Dark Secrets**: Leverage the city's abandoned state to slowly reveal Midway's backstory and why it might be overrun by darkness. Perhaps there are elements of corporate malfeasance, shadowy government experiments, or occult practices that were taking place in the '90s and are only now starting to have visible consequences. 8. **Integration of the Supernatural**: The game's setting in the '90s can offer a contrast between the somewhat recent past and more ancient, timeless supernatural forces. The urban decay and darkness enveloping Midway could have roots in an evil that predates the city itself, with the modern decay only serving to awaken it. Remember, the more you flesh out the details of your setting and the progression from one environment to the next, the more immersive the experience will be for the player. You can create tension and horror not just through what is seen and encountered directly but also through what is implied and suggested by the game's atmosphere, story, and environment."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori! Ready for today’s club meeting?” Sayori: “Good morning, Monika! Oh, you bet I am! I can’t wait to share my new poem with everyone.” Monika: “That’s great to hear, Sayori!

We’ll make sure to take care of you and support you throughout the event. We’ll all pitch in to help with the booth and make sure everything runs smoothly. We want you to enjoy the festival too.” Natsuki: “Thanks, Monika. That means a lot to me. I’m also looking forward to seeing what everyone else in the club has prepared for the festival.

And, of course, we can always count on Yuri to bring her unique style and thought-provoking poetry.” (The sound of the door opening interrupts their conversation, and Yuri walks in carrying a box filled with handmade bookmarks.) Yuri: “Good morning, everyone. I apologize for being late. I wanted to make sure these bookmarks looked their best.” Monika: “No worries, Yuri. I’m sure they’ll be amazing like everything else you create. What are the bookmarks for?” Yuri: “Well, I thought it would be nice to have some small, tangible gifts to give to people who visit our booth. These bookmarks are all handcrafted and feature quotes from famous literature. It’s a way to showcase the beauty of language and literature.” Natsuki: “That’s such a thoughtful idea, Yuri. I’m sure people will treasure these bookmarks. It’s another great way to attract attention to our club and share our love for literature.” Sayori: “I can’t wait to see everything come together at the festival. It’s going to be so much fun!” Monika: “Indeed, Sayori. I have a feeling our literature club's booth will be a popular spot at the festival.

Izuku's father, the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possesive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia], who [Hiashi] is [Hiashi] in fact [Hiashi's true identity] the post-Quirk emergence Nihon-jin criminal underworld supreme leader and crime boss known only by his [Hiashi's] Quirk name [All for One], which his [Hiashi's] current legal wife and Izuku's mother, the short, slender and petite but somewhat curvy and buxom, reserved, soft-spoken and somewhat quiet but also determined, head-strong and focused with a weak telekinesis Quirk Midoriya Inko nee Shimura [Boku no Hero Academia] along with his [Hiashi's] son [Izuku] and [Hiashi's] legal heir [Izuku], [Inko and Izuku] being [what happens to both Inko and Izuku] clueless [Inko and Izuku] about [what Inko and Izuku both |Inko and Izuku| don't know] his [Hiashi's] true occupation [ruling the Japanese criminal underworld, [Hiashi] never encounters [whom Hiashi never encounters] the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, skinny and slender half-American, determined and soft-spoken but also focused with a Quirk that boosts his strength, speed and agility and is passed down from user to user Toshinori Yagi [Boku no Hero Academia], who [Yagi] is [what Yagi is] the Number 1# Nihon-jin Hero in his [Yagi's] Hero persona All Might [Boku no Hero Academia], [Hiashi never meeting All Might] and thus [Hiashi] never fighting him [All Might] the day after Izuku's Quirk test when he [Izuku] is [how old is Izuku when he |Izuku| takes a Quirk test] only four, thus allowing him [Hiashi] to be involved in his [Hiashi's] family's [Inko's and Izuku's] life as he [Hiashi in this story] never has to waste time fixing his [Hiashi's] face and body, although he [Hiashi] secretly gives his [Hiashi's] son [Izuku] a combined pyrokinesis [fire manipulating |pyrokinesis|] and telekinetic quirk after he [Hiashi] hears his [Hiashi's] beloved wife [Inko] crying about their [Hiashi's and Inko's] beloved baby boy [young Izuku] is [young Izuku] Quirkless [Boku no Hero Academia] the day after the Quirk test, with this [Izuku suddenly gaining a Quirk after the Quirk test] means that Izuku and the blonde-haired, red-eyed, short and slender but muscular explosive sweat-Quirk having, proud and arrogant Bakugō Katsuki [Boku no Hero Academia], [Izuku and Katsuki] remain friends [Izuku and Katsuki] in this story, although Katsuki in this story is [what Katsuki is in this story] female [Katsuki in this story] with a rather slim and slender but also curvy and rather buxom build, as well as [the female Katsuki in this story] having [what the female Katsuki has in this story] her [the female Katsuki's in this story] blonde hair grown long and in drill-style twintails, [the female Katsuki's hair in this story] being down to her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] heels and [the female Katsuki in this story] is [the female Katsuki in this story] a kitsune [fox |kitsune|] monmosu [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] and [the female Katsuki in this story also being] a Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contracter, with her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] being the Norse goddess of love, war and fate Freyja [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō]. The white-haired, red-eyed, soft-spoken and easily-scared but calm and determined time-manipulating young orphan girl Eri from Boku no Hero Academia is [Eri in this story] in fact Hiashi's distant descendant [Eri in this story] from one of his [Hiashi's] many one-night stands, marriages, lovers and concubines under the many aliases he [Hiashi] has [Hiashi] had over the years and so when he [Hiashi] hears her [Eri's] psychic cry for help from her [Eri's] current state of imprisonment from the branch of the Shie Hassaikai [Eight Precepts of Death |Shie Hassaikai|] Yakuza organization [Boku no Hero Academia], he [Hiashi] decides to rescue her [Eri], wiping out the Shie Hassaikai and [Hiashi] leaving no presence of its [Shie Hassaikai's] existence, although he [Hiashi] does take the Shie Hassaikai's leader, the sociopathic, Quirk and Hero hating, determined and cunning but also delusional, black-haired and amber-eyed Chisaki Kai's [Boku no Hero Academia] Quirk [Boku no Hero Academia], Overhaul, which [Overhaul] allows Kai the ability to disassemble anything he [Kai] touches, as well as reassemble it [the matter Kai touches] in any configuration he [Kai] desires, [Overhaul's matter manpulation ability] effectively giving him [Kai] full control over the matter [that comes into contact with Kai], [Hiashi taking Overhaul from Kai] before [Hiashi] taking his [Kai's] memories and [Hiashi] subsequently killing him [Kai], [Hiashi after rescuing Eri] rewriting her [Eri's] memories so that she [Eri] will [Eri] have no memory of her [Eri's] captors [the Shie Hassaikai] and [Hiashi after rescuing Eri from the the Shie Hassaikai] taking her [Eri] home with him [Hiashi] passing her [Eri] off as a street child [Eri in Hiashi's story] that he [Hiashi] adopted to his [Hiashi's] wife [Inko] and [Hiashi's] son [Izuku], which they [Inko and Hiashi] surprisingly buy, with Inko seeing Eri as her [Inko's] own daughter and Izuku getting used to [Izuku] having a little sister [Eri]. The female Katsuki in this story has strong feelings for Izuku in this story that she [the female Katsuki's in this story] hides [the female Katsuki's in this story's feelings] by acting tough, although he [Izuku] is [Izuku] obviously clueless about this [the female Katsuki's in this story's] obvious feelings for him [Izuku]. Eri is three years younger than [who is three years older than Eri in this story] him [Izuku] and [Eri in this story] loves him [Eri] deeply to the point of [Eri in this story] wanting [Eri in this story] to [Eri in this story] be his [Izuku's] loving wife [future Eri in her |Eri's| mind] and [Eri in her mind] subsequently mother his [Izuku's] children, which [Eri's deep feelings for him] he [Izuku] is [Izuku in this story] obviously clueless about. The female Katsuki in this story is also partially Russian-Jewish, partially German and partially American on the maternal side of her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] family, with her [the female Katsuki's in this story's] American name being Claire Harvey [Handoreddo], the heiress [Claire] of [what Claire is |Claire| next in line |Claire| to |Claire| inherit] the powerful American financial, economic, industrial and technological power known as the Harvey family [Handoreddo], whom [the Harveys] created and [the Harveys] control the massive industrial, technological, industrial and economic megacorp known as Warslan Enterprises [Handoreddo], which [Warslan Enterprises] created the Century Armaments and [Warslan Enterprises] is [Warslan Enterprises] the primary sponsor [Warslan Enterprises] of the Slayers [Handoreddo], with Claire being [what Claire is] a rather strong Slayer [Handoreddo] herself [Claire] despite her [Claire's] status as the Harvey heiress [Claire's true self]. Despite this Claire chooses to live in the surviving Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku in this story as Katsumi [the female Katsuki's in this story's Japanese first name] in order to rise to the top of the Nihon-jin Hero system and then [Claire as Katsumi] marry Izuku as his [Izuku's] wife [future Claire in her |Claire's| mind]. Unknown to everyone, Eri is [what Eri also is in this story] also a Variant [Handoreddo] along with [Eri in this story] also being [Eri in this story] part-Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] herself [Eri in this story] from a foul Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contract, [Eri in this story] now being [what Eri now is in this story] the human form [Eri in this story] of the God of trickery, deception and cunning in Norse mythology Loki after [Eri in this story] absorbing him [Loki in this story] into herself [Eri in this story] after he [Loki in this story] tried to take over her [Eri's] body and [Loki in this story] failed, [Loki's failed possession of Eri] leading to her [Eri in this story] gaining all of his [Loki's] powers, skills and abilities along with the ability to also form a contract with a human as a Diva [Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō]. The excerpt should start off with Izuku successfully killing his [Izuku's] daily Quota of Savages [Handoreddo] with the help of his [Izuku's] Variant [Handoreddo] abilities that [Izuku's Variant abilities] he [Izuku] successfully keeps hidden, [Izuku after killing the Savages] sneaking off the battlefield and to the local Warslan Enterprise branch after [Izuku] changing into civilian clothing, [Izuku] handing over the recorded proof of him [Izuku] slaying the Savages to the lady at the desk and [Izuku] collecting his payment for his [Izuku's] work as a Slayer [Handoreddo] before [Izuku] heading back to his [Izuku's] room at the UA dorm, only to find Eri in his [Eri's] dorm room changing. [Izuku] blushing in embarrassment, [Izuku] quickly closes the door and [Izuku] looks around, [Izuku] waiting a few minutes before [Izuku] reentering, only to see her [Eri] in [what Eri is currently wearing] a rather beautiful, flowing formal white dress that [Eri's white dress] emphasies her [Eri's] now-rather large bust and her [Eri's] developing curves, which causes him [Izuku] to blush. After [Izuku] closing the door and [Izuku] getting back inside, he [Izuku] asks her [Eri] what she [Eri] is [Eri] doing here [U.A] to which she [Eri] replies that she [Eri] is simply here [at UA] to support him [Izuku] in more ways than one. Eri then states that she [Eri] knows about him [Izuku] being both a Variant [Handoreddo] and a Slayer [Handoreddo], [Eri] revealing that she [Eri] is [Eri] also a Variant [Handoreddo] with a Century Armament and [Eri in this story] wishes to be a Slayer [Handoreddo], so she [Eri] disguised herself [Eri] as a boy and [Eri] joined U.A as a student in order to [Eri] be close to him [Izuku] and [Eri] sign up for the Slayer [Handoreddo] course at U.A. Eri also reveals that the virus that creates Variants can be suppressed by exchange of saliva, in other words passionate kissing, which causes him [Izuku] to blush in embarrassment as she [Eri] clings tightly to him [Izuku]. The next day at the U.A Sports Festival, Claire [Handoreddo] finds herself [Claire] forced to reveal the Century Armaments [Handoreddo] to the global public, although she [Claire] manages to get inside her [Claire's] future husband's [Izuku's] team during the obstacle course and tug of war events, [Claire] making sure he [Izuku] is [Izuku] as close to her [Claire] as possible. Eri in her [Eri's] disguise as a male U.A student, [Eri disguised as a guy] also [Eri disguised as a guy] manages to get into his [Izuku's] team, although she [Eri] uses Loki's powers to create a clone of herself [Eri] in her [Eri's] male disguise during the one on one battles while [Eri] staying in the audience in her [Eri's] true female form. During the battle between Izuku and the tall, slender but somewhat muscular, indigo-haired and purple-eyed, mind-control-Quirk having, stoic, brilliant and academically gifted and straightforward but conversational Support Course student at UA Shinsō Hitoshi [Boku no Hero Academia], Izuku uses his [Izuku's] training in [what Izuku is |Izuku| trained in] Ken'do [the way of the sword/sword way |Ken'do/Kendo/Kendō|, a traditional Nihon-jin style of fencing |Kendo| with |what is used to fight in Kendo| a two-handed wooden sword known as |the name of the two-handed wooden sword used in Kendo| a bokken, {Kendo} derived |Kendo| from |where Kendo originated from| the fighting methods of the ancient samurai], Ruuchuu Kobudō [old martial way of Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu |Ruuchuu Kobudō|, a Nihon-jin hand-weapon art |Ruuchuu Kobudō| that |what happened to Ruuchuu Kobudō| originated |Ruuchuu Kobudō| in |where Ruuchuu Kobudō originated in| Ryūkyū/Ruuchuu and |Ruuchuu Kobudō| utilizes |what Ruuchuu Kobudō utilizes| the kon |six foot staff|, sai |three-pronged truncheon|, tonfa |handled club|, kama |sickle|, and nunchaku |two rope- or chain-connected sticks|, but also |what other weapons are used in Ruuchuu Kobudō apart from the kon, saim tonfa, kama and nunchaku| the tekko (knuckledusters), tinbe-rochin (shield and spear), and surujin (weighted chain), with |what else happens in Ruuchuu Kobudō| its |Ruuchuu Kobudō's| CQC |close quaters combat|/hand to hand combat side being |what Ruuchuu Kobudō's CQC's/hand to hand combat side is| Shorin-ryu tode |Shorin Style/Shorin-ryu karate/China hand {Shorin-ryu tode}|, which |Shorin-ryu tode| is |what Shorin-ryu tode is| a system |Shorin-ryu tode| of |what is a system of| tode, |China Hand (tode)|, also |tode| known |tode| as |the other name of tode| karate |empty hand(karate)| in |where tode is |tode| known |tode| as karate| the Nihon Hondo and |where else apart from the Nihon Hondo tode is (tode) known (tode) as karate in| the Western World, which |tode/karate| is |what tode/karate is| a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system |tode/karate| of |what tode/karate is (tode/karate) a traditional Ryūkyū-ko/Ruuchuu system (tode/karate) of| unarmed combat |tode/karate|, which |tode/karate| focues |tode/karate| on |what tode/karate focuses on| delivering |tode/karate| sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to |where tode/karate focuses |tode/karate| on delivering sharp blows and kicks along with throws, joint locks and other grappling techniques to| pressure-sensitive points on the body, |Shorin-ryu tode being (Shorin-ryu tode) a system (Shorin-ryu-tode) of tode| that |Shorin-ryu tode| utilizing |what Shorin-ryu tode utilizes| swift, fast techniques based on |what Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on| the strategy of |what the strategy Shorin-ryu tode's swift, fast techniques are based on is| simultaneously evading an enemy's attacks and |what else simultanously happens when using Shorin-ryu tode in battle apart from evading enemy strikes| attacking senstive spots of the enemy's body during battle], Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|], and jūjutsu [gentle art | jūjutsu| a Nihon-jin martial art |jūjutsu| that |what jūjutsu is| focuses |jūjutsu| on |what jūjutsu focuses on| striking, kicking, grappling and wrestling that |jūjutsu| can |what can happen to jūjutsu| be || used |jūjutsu| to |what jūjutsu can (jūjutsu) be (jūjutsu) used (jūjutsu) to do| kill or disable an opponent in combat to [Izuku during the fight] utterly dominate Hitoshi, causing Eri to cheer from the stadium and Claire to smile in happiness.

P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Under the crackling night sky of a neo-Tokyo skyline, an electrifying tension hummed in the atmosphere. The high-intensity arcs of plasma gunfire reverberated through the air, illuminating the desolate terrain as Izuku Midoriya, the unlikely Variant, exercised lethal finesse, swiftly laying to waste his target quota of the formidable Savages. Silence fell like a heavy cloak over the battlefield as Midoriya, his breaths measured and uniform, exchanged his blood-splattered armor for unassuming civilian garb. Slipping unnoticed into the ranks of everyday life, he made his way to the local Warslan Enterprise branch. His movements were deliberate, calm after the storm of violence, but his eyes held a storm that was never quite at peace. He slid a chip across the counter to the impeccably-suited attendant, the digital numbers flicking through the death tally. A chime signaled completion, and a neat sum materialized in his account balance. Nodding a silent thank you, he retreated, stepping back into shadows where he belonged. Back at the UA dorms, the air was heavy with a different kind of tension. He'd barely cracked open his door when the sight that greeted him stole the breath from his lungs. \\"E-Eri?!\\" he gasped, his usual emerald orbs rounded in surprise, the blush from his cheeks threatening to subsume his entire face. \\"Oh! Izuku,\\" Eri squeaked, a nearly divine figure drenched in white, the dress almost ethereal. \\"I was just... Uh, getting ready.\\" Izuku clumsily averted his gaze, murmuring a litany of apologies, and shut the door with more force than necessary. His back pressed hard against it, he waited, the seconds ticking away like years until he ventured again inside. Now clad in her formal attire, Eri was innocence woven into allure, the white dress hugging every curve of her now mature figure. \\"Izuku,\\" she began, her eyes a blend of seriousness and adoration, \\"I know your secrets—the Variant, the Slayer. I am those, too. I disguised myself to join UA, to be by your side.\\" His heart thudded against his ribcage as he processed her confession. Meanwhile, Eri inched closer, her breath now shared with his. \\"The virus... it can be suppressed by... a kiss,\\" she whispered, the words tinged with vulnerability and boldness. The world blurred, their lips merely whispers apart when— The clamor of the UA Sports Festival shattered their moment. Spectators buzzed with excitement, a melting pot of quirks, armor, and anticipation— all geared towards the ultimate display of prowess. Claire, wrapped in her regal Century Armament, slipped through the crowd to join Team Midoriya. Determination set her jaw as she readied for proximity; proximity to victory, and proximity to the heart of her Midoriya. Eri, meanwhile, had replicated herself, a clever ruse, as she both competed and observed, her true form catching every nuance, every gesture from the stands. On the battlefield, Midoriya faced his friend, Shinsō Hitoshi, his every move was a dance of discipline and strategy learned from ancient arts. Eri watched, her voice joining the cacophony of cheers, while Claire's eyes remained fixated, a private smile gracing her lips whenever his sheer skill eclipsed the sun's own brilliance. Ochako's subsequent clash with Mirio was a spectacle, a dance of gravity, steel, and tradition as her IS unit Shenlong bore down on her opponent. A victorious bounce radiated sheer joy as her gaze found Midoriya's, and her name was on her lips, and perhaps, etched across her heart. Claire's duel with Momo Yaoyorozu—an heiress versus heiress, Diva against Diva, yielded no victor but shared the spotlight with ample force. Their intense battle left the audience awe-struck, as whispers of Quirk evolution filled the air. As night fell over UA, Midoriya, Claire, Eri, and the others navigated their layered realities— war machines, enchanted armor, mythological contracts, and the simplest complexities of human emotions—a conflict of the heart proving the hardest to decipher. The tapestry of their intertwined fates, against the grandeur of technomagic and the undercurrents of ancient arts, was unraveled beneath the starlit sky of a world unified by the extraordinary."},{"prompt":"What is the biggest Cult in the Philippines?","completion":"Determining the \\"biggest\\" cult in the Philippines can be challenging, as the definition of a cult may vary among different sources, and some organizations considered as cults may be secretive or not officially documented. Furthermore, the term \\"cult\\" often carries a negative connotation and is used to describe groups with extreme or unorthodox beliefs and practices, particularly those considered to deviate from mainstream religion or society. However, one of the most well-known religious movements in the Philippines that has often been referred to as a cult (especially by its detractors) is the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), founded in 1914 by Felix Manalo. It's important to note that while some may label the INC as a cult, it is considered a legitimate Christian religious organization by many, with a significant following in the Philippines and a growing presence abroad. There are also several other smaller groups that are more widely recognized as cults, such as the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name, founded by Apollo Quiboloy. However, this group also identifies as a Christian Restorationist church but has faced various controversies and allegations of cult-like behavior. It's worth noting that the general understanding of what constitutes a religious cult is subjective and varies. Typically, the term \\"cult\\" is replaced with less charged language like \\"new religious movement\\" or \\"minority religious group\\" in academic and interfaith discussions to avoid unnecessary stigma and promote understanding."},{"prompt":"Philippines that has often been referred to as a cult (especially by its detractors) is the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), founded in 1914 by Felix Manalo. How to leave this hell?","completion":"Leaving Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) or any religious organization one no longer wishes to be a part of can be a difficult personal decision, especially in cases where the organization has a strong communal aspect and leaving might lead to significant life changes. Here are some general steps and considerations for those looking to leave INC or a similar group: 1. **Personal Reflection:** Ensure that you have thought through your decision carefully. Leaving a religious group can have emotional, social, and sometimes economic impacts, so it's important to be sure about your decision. 2. **Research:** Look into the experiences of others who have left INC or similar religious organizations for guidance and insight into what the process might entail. 3. **Plan:** Consider your living situation, financial stability, and support system. Plan ahead for any changes you might need to make to your lifestyle once you leave the community. 4. **Seek Support:** If possible, reach out to friends or family members who are understanding and supportive of your decision. There are also online forums and support groups for those who have left or are considering leaving the INC. 5. **Official Departure:** If you are a registered member, you may need to formally leave the INC by writing a letter or informing the church leadership of your decision to no longer be a part of the organization. 6. **Legal Considerations:** If you encounter any legal issues or threats upon your decision to leave, seek legal assistance. 7. **Emotional Support:** Leaving a religious community can be emotionally challenging. Consider seeking the help of a mental health professional who can provide you with the emotional support you need during this transition. 8. **Rebuilding:** As you leave the religious community, you may need to rebuild parts of your life, such as creating new social networks or exploring different belief systems that align with your personal values. It's important to remember that everyone's situation is unique, and the best course of action may vary depending on personal circumstances. The process can be long and challenging, but many find a sense of freedom and personal growth after leaving a religious group that no longer aligns with their beliefs and values. If you are in immediate danger or fear for your safety, it is critical to contact local authorities or seek help from organizations dedicated to aiding individuals in such circumstances."},{"prompt":"vspace*{-baselineskip}% parbox[t]{textwidth}{% parbox[t]{.25textwidth}{articleinfobox[3pt]hrule}hfill% parbox[t]{0.7textwidth}{rule{.7textwidth}{.2pt}vskip10pt begin{tabular*}{.7textwidth}{c@{}p{.7textwidth}} hspace*{7pt}&ABSTRACT[8pt] hline[-8pt] end{tabular*} hspace*{13.5pt}parbox[t]{.677textwidth}{unhboxabsbox}% [3pt]rule{.7textwidth}{.2pt}%vskip10pt% }} end{elsarticletitlealign}% vspace*{2pc} printFirstPageNotes }sty文件中这段代码每行具体控制了什么","completion":"这段代码控制了文章的摘要部分的样式。具体来说： -

Riots immediately emerge in Han China and the USA over the enforcement of the Treaty, although the unrest in the former is quickly put down and a restored Beiyang Government of the Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China is made the government of China, although the Ming dynasty's imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu, is reenthroned to power in China. Things get worse when the IS unit is revealed to the public and the all-female student body IS Academy is built on a series of small Okinawan Islands that once held US bases. Before this, when Tabane is just 12 years old, she [Tabane] rescues her [Tabane's] younger male cousin and Chifuyu's biological younger brother, the black-haired, red-eyed, tall, muscular and slender, intellectually gifted and academically brilliant but lazy and laid-back, kind and loving young boy Orimura Ichika [IS: Infinite Stratos] from the Orimura clan when he [Ichika] is [Ichika] just a baby instead of Chifuyu like canon IS: Infinite Stratos. Ichika views Tabane as his [Tabane's] older sister in this fic although he [Ichika] is sometimes exparated by her [Tabane's] eccentricity. The then five-year Ichika helped immensely in the construction of the IS Unit before Chifuyu's demonstration of its [the IS Unit's] might [the White Knight Incident] although the young child [young Ichika] was of course clueless of its [the IS Unit's true purpose]. Ichika in this fic hides the fact that he [Ichika] can pilot an IS unit and thus never attends the IS Academy, but lives a normal life. The excerpt should focus on a now-15 year old Ichika and a 27-year-old Tabane at a secret session of the American Congress with the American Joint Chiefs of Staff and the American intelligence heads being present held in the White House, surrounded by US Marines and CIA SAD death squad members if they [Ichika and Tabane] try to escape. Ichika, unused to being in a Western suit, fidgets nervously while Tabane, unfazed, bounces around her [Tabane's] feet as the US President prepares to question her [Tabane] about the sudden invasion of monmosu into the USA, with the Blue Dog, pro-Confederate faction of the Democrat Party that used the KKK as its street arm blaming the mass-kidnapping of American men by the monmosu on the Republican religious right and the evangelicals that support the Republican theocrats, viewing it as a vast-right wing libertarian-communist conspiracy run by a coalition \\"the Jews\\" and the religious Christian right to destroy the \\"secular white race\\" and revive the Soviet Union, with moderate Democrats rightfully viewing this as fascist nonsense and forming reluctant alliances with moderate Republicans to try and stop Blue Dog-affiliated white nationalist groups from attacking major evangelical churches and black civil rights organizations and Trotskyist neocons and religious theocrats in the Republican Party seeing it as a judgement of God for the Democrat Party enforced Jim Crow and segregation and the Democrat Party's suppression of labor unions during WW1 under the fascist dictator Woodrow Wilson. When the US President asks Tabane if she [Tabane] has any idea why these creatures [the monmosu] are kidnapping men and/or seducing them, even forming normal relationships with human men in the USA in some cases, Tabane simply replies that the age of man has ended and the age of love has begun in a sing-song, childish voice in perfect British English before explaining the origins and purpise monmosu and the world they [the monmosu] came from in high-class Japanese, [Tabane] insulting the leader of the Blue Dog Democrats by telling him he could go sign up for the forces of the monmosu-hating, human supremacist terror group Illas Kreuz [Monmusume Kuesto!] in a mixture of German and high-class Japanese when they find the portal binding the worlds together, [Tabane] stating that it comes as no surprise the Democrat Party became the world's first fascist party and Woodrow Wilson the world's first fascist dictator during WW1, [Tabane] stating that she [Tabane] wonders if the failed historian [Woodrow] turned ruthless dictator [Woodrow] perhaps got some ideas from the Great Goddess Illas [Monmusume Kuesto!] whom [Illas] the members of Illas Kreuz worship to the point of insanity when the man tries to retaliate and [Tabane] uses one of her inventions to restrain him as Ichika face-palms. Tabane continues with her [Tabane's] explanation, [Tabane] explaining what she [Tabane] truly created the IS Unit for as she [Tabane] casually hacks into the US satelite system, [Tabane] finding her [Tabane's] true self's [Granberia's] master [Alice] in Kyoto using the US satelite system as Ichika reveals the newest Third Generation IS model, more specifically in the neighborhood where Tabane and Ichika live as she [Tabane] compares Wilson to a prototype of Adolf Hitler but being even more ruthless and destructive, and the Klan to the Brownshirts, causing peals of suppressed laughter from moderate Democrats and Republicans as she [Tabane] openly states her [Tabane's] suspicion that both Wilson and Trotsky were puppets of Illas on Earth to transform Earth into a copy of her [Tabane's] former world via political extremism and ethnic-narcissism instead of religion like in Granberia's and Alice's home world. Tabane finishes locating Alice, [Tabane] realizing that she [Alice] was [Alice] reincarnated on Earth as well. Using her [Granberia's] telepathic connection to Alice, she [Tabane] is able to locate Alice and [Tabane] convince her [Alice] to dress up in a human form under a disguise and teleport into the White House. It is then that Ichika realizes that the 'fairy tales' Tabane told him as a boy weren't in fact fantasy, they were in fact documentaries of her [Tabane's] time in her [Tabane's] former world as he [Ichika] quickly realises who the stunning young woman [Alice's reincarnation] teleporting into the White House is despite the disguise. Alice has been reincarnated into a distant relative of the Orimuras and Shinomonos and the part Russian Jewish heiress of the Sarashiki Japanese samurai clan, the blue-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, buxom and curvy, seductive and cunning but also kind and soft-hearted Katana Sarashiki [IS: Infinite Stratos] whom [Katana] Tabane would always call [Katana] mistress the few times she [Katana] visited Tabane and Ichika and Ichika figures out why as Tabane whispers into Katana's ear how to get the point across without causing bloodshed, after which Katana reveals her [Katana's] true identity [Alice] and her [Katana's] status [the Monster Lord] abd [Katana] offers not to wage war against the USA and Russia if the leaders of both nations with co-operate with her [Katana] in hunting down elements of Illas Kreuz that have made their way to Earth both in the past and present as Ichika's jaw remains open. The Blue Dog Democrats continue to resist, angry at the insulting of their dear leader [Wilson] but the most militant ones find themselves arrested as evidence of secret crimes reaches the FBI agents present at the meeting. The US President gets a call from the Russian Tsar begging him for clarity as to what is going on, as the restored Russian Empire also has a similar monmosu problem with neo-Trotskyists and neo-Stalinists uniting under the banner of Soviet restorationism to fight the monmosu and failing. Tabane intercepts the calls and says she [Tabane] can help and allows Alice to take the line. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Given the complexity and specific crossover requirements of the scenario described, let's dive into a sample scene from this richly elaborate fanfiction universe: --- **A Hushed Confrontation in the White House** **In a secret session at the White House** The air in the restricted room bristled with tension, powerful individuals from the American high command seated in stark military uniform and business suits. At the heart of it all were two Japanese visitors, the prodigious mind behind the IS technology, Tabane Shinonono, and her cousin, Ichika Orimura. **US President:** Dr. Shinonono, we appreciate your cooperation. The ongoing... phenomena... it is unlike anything we’ve encountered. Can you shed some light on the... *monmosu* situation? Tabane, a vision of poise with her sleek, pink hair, tilted her head, bearing a nonchalant grin. **Tabane (sing-song voice):** The age of man might be waning, Mr. President, but the age of *love* has dawned! Teehee! Confusion rippled through the room, officers exchanging bewildered glances. Tabane continued, her voice flipping to polished Japanese, her feet playfully swinging as she spoke. **Tabane:** These monster girls, they come from a world much like ours but suffused in magic and, ah, passionate encounters between species. They seek warmth, love, partnership. Some want to protect mankind, others, well, they're overcome by desire. The leader of the Blue Dog Democrats, a southerner with a stern face, leaned forward, his voice steeped in deep-rooted suspicion. **Blue Dog Leader:** This is absurd! Are you implicating that these creatures kidnapping our men is *merely* about love and partnership? Tabane cast a sly glance at the man, responding in a mix of sharp German and fluent Japanese. **Tabane:** If your feathers are so ruffled, sir, perhaps you could check for a portal and join the Illas Kreuz. They share your... distaste for things not purely human. Though it's no surprise, considering your party's history with old Woodrow, the prototype for modern fascists. The room fell into stunned silence before a smattering of uncomfortable chuckles bubbled from the moderates. Tabane fiddled with a device in her hand, seamlessly hacking into satellite feeds, as Ichika, uncomfortable in his western suit, facepalmed discreetly, mumbling a litany of apologies for his cousin's bluntness. **Ichika:** She's not wrong though... **Tabane (continuously tapping away on her device):** Moreover, your revered President Wilson, I suspect, was a pawn of Illas on Earth, aiming to recreate my former world under the guise of political extremism. Fascinating, isn't it? Before more rebukes could be thrown, a ripple of magical energy pulsed through the air. An elegant figure, previously disguised as a seductive blue-haired heiress, manifested — Alice, the true Monster Lord. **Alice (Katana's guise slipping away):** Greetings. My influence over your world was never meant to cause such discourse. Yet, here we stand, at the precipice of a potential alliance or conflict. I propose cooperation in excising the malevolence of Illas Kreuz from your Earth, in exchange for peace. The room fell into a heavy silence as if the gravity of her words weighed on their very souls. Ichika gaped at Alice, realization dawning within him. **Ichika (whispering to himself):** So... the fairy tales were true. The Blue Dog Democrats bristled at their loss of control, but a swift move from federal agents silenced their most radical elements, evidence of their deepest secrets exposed in a swift maneuver by the FBI. **US President (picking up a phone call from the Russian Tsar):** Your highness, the situation is... complex. I'm handing the line over to Dr. Shinonono for clarity. Tabane nodded, her voice crisp and clear as she addressed the uneasy Tsar. **Tabane:** Fear not, your Highness. We have both the knowledge and the might to cleanse your lands of the Kreuz's ill intentions. It's time for us to unite against a common hidden enemy. Together, in that room where power and otherworldliness collided, a new chapter was written — an age of love that promised a future entwined with legacy, ambition, and the extraordinary tapestry of the monmosu's desires. ---"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

Tabane invents the IS Unit [IS: Infinite Stratos] when she [Tabane] is seventeen years old as a means of physically manifesting a contracted spirit via technological means for combat and [Tabane in this story] had her [Tabane's] childhood friend and [Tabane's] two-year younger cousin, the then fifteen-year old black-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also buxom and curvy, calm and soft-spoken but also headstrong and determined Yamato Nadeshiko [traditional Japanese beauty] samurai noble heiress Orimura Chifuyu [IS: Infinite Stratos] act as the first pilot of the IS Unit [IS: Infinite Stratos], [Chifuyu] wiping out several ICBMs along with carrier groups sent by the USA, the PRC and the Russian Federation to invade and divide Japan while [Chifuyu] in her [Chifuyu's] IS Unit, an event [Chifuyu's decimation of a significant portion of the US, mainland Chinese and Russian nuclear arsenal and naval forces] known as the \\"White Knight Incident\\" [IS: Infinite Stratos], although Chifuyu's identity is covered by her [Chifuyu's] IS Unit, allowing her [Chifuyu] and her [Chifuyu's] older female cousin [Tabane] to go unnoticed as the US President, the American Joint Chiefs of Staffs, the Russian President and heads of the Russian military along with the Chinese President and CCP and PLA elites sign a peace treaty in Kyoto that essentially acknowledges that Russia and America started WW2 by supporting the Chiang Kai Shek-ruled KMT lead National Chinese State in the Chinese warlord era against Japan and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China and essentially hands the Korean peninsula, Sahlakin Island, the Kurils and Taiwan back to Japan under UN supervision. The effect on the Chinese and the Russians is the same as the Treaty of Brest-Litvosk, the Qing imperial family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchukuo returns in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and Mengjiang United Autonomous Government, ruled by the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin in Inner Mongolia's Charhar and Suiyan regions are [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] restored as Japanese protectorates, with all Han living in these areas being deported back to China. The Japanese protectorate of the Far Eastern Republic is restored on the Russian East Coast, East Turkestan becomes independent as a Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire and Tibet is liberated under the rule of the Llamas. The Cantonia region of China is given to the Vietnamese, who experience a \\"revolution\\" that sees the restoration of the Imperial House of Ngyuen and the Empire of Vietnam soon later. For Russia, Siberia becomes independent and EU troops are sent into European Russia to \\"enforce the peace treaty\\" with Germany reclaiming all of Prussia from Poland and Russia. European Russia becomes a restored Russian Empire under the rule of the Romanovs with any KGB and Soviet Communist Party loyalists in Russia mysteriously disappearing before they can resist. After a series of revolutions in pro-Russian Central Europe and the Balkans, Austria regains all territory of the Austria-Hungarian Empire and puppets Serbia and Montenegro as Austrian satelite kingdoms along with Poland. For the United States, the effect is the same as the Treaty of Versailles. The Philippines comes under Japanese influence and Hawaii is liberated as a Kingdom under the restored House of Kalākaua, with the US being forced to accept its role in WW2 and WW1 and pay massive repatriations. Riots immediately emerge in Han China and the USA over the enforcement of the Treaty, although the unrest in the former is quickly put down and a restored Beiyang Government of the Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China is made the government of China, although the Ming dynasty's imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu, is reenthroned to power in China. Things get worse when the IS unit is revealed to the public and the all-female student body IS Academy is built on a series of small Okinawan Islands that once held US bases. Before this, when Tabane is just 12 years old, she [Tabane] rescues her [Tabane's] younger male cousin and Chifuyu's biological younger brother, the black-haired, red-eyed, tall, muscular and slender, intellectually gifted and academically brilliant but lazy and laid-back, kind and loving young boy Orimura Ichika [IS: Infinite Stratos] from the Orimura clan when he [Ichika] is [Ichika] just a baby instead of Chifuyu like canon IS: Infinite Stratos. Ichika views Tabane as his [Tabane's] older sister in this fic although he [Ichika] is sometimes exparated by her [Tabane's] eccentricity. The then five-year Ichika helped immensely in the construction of the IS Unit before Chifuyu's demonstration of its [the IS Unit's] might [the White Knight Incident] although the young child [young Ichika] was of course clueless of its [the IS Unit's true purpose]. Ichika in this fic hides the fact that he [Ichika] can pilot an IS unit and thus never attends the IS Academy, but lives a normal life. The excerpt should focus on Chifuyu trying out the very first IS Unit as Tabane bounces around her [Chifuyu], her [Tabane's] bust bouncing with her [Tabane] as her [Tabane's] assistant [five-year-old Ichika] looks on in confusion. Chifuyu looks for a moment and sees how Tabane's young assistant [young Ichika] looks quite similar to her [Chifuyu's] supposedly dead younger brother and [Chifuyu] wonders if Tabane also took someone else [baby Ichika] when she [Tabane] escaped from the Orimura clan, but [Chifuyu] ignored it. Chifuyu successfully equips the prototype IS Unit and [Chifuyu] takes off into the sky P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Certainly, this story concept requires a creative blending of the Monster Girl Encyclopedia, Monster Girl Quest, and Infinite Stratos in a unified narrative without the use of alternate universes or multiverse concepts. This poses an interesting challenge in storytelling. Below is a sample scene broadly inspired by your detailed premise: --- **Location: Tabane Shinonono's Secret Laboratory, Outskirts of Kyoto** *Amidst the sprawling tech wonderland of Tabane's lab, a towering, gigantic hangar hides the fruits of her latest genius: the first Infinite Stratos (IS) Unit. Machines whir and sparks fly as final adjustments are made. Tabane, a bundle of energy, oversees the construction with a blend of focus and playfulness, all the while her young assistant, Ichika, trails behind — a picture of innocence cast against the clinical ambiance.* **Ichika:** \\"Tabane-neesan, will this really fly?\\" **Tabane:** \\"Hehe, of course, Ichika-kun! It'll dance across the sky like a dragon!\\" *Her laugh bursts brightly as she references her own hidden past, an inside joke with her reincarnated soul. In that moment, the gravity of what they're about to accomplish hangs traceably in the air.* *The great metal doors slide open, revealing Chifuyu Orimura, composed and resolute. Her eyes briefly wander to Ichika, sensing a familiarity she can't place.* **Chifuyu:** \\"Is everything prepared, Shinonono?\\" **Tabane:** \\"All set, Chifuyu-chan! Operation 'Fairy Tail Dance' is ready for takeoff!\\" *The IS Unit, sleek and almost sentient in its silence, awaits its pilot. Chifuyu approaches with the stride of a seasoned warrior. She steps into the metal colossus; the unit whirs to life, crafting a shield barrier as Chifuyu gets acquainted with her new might.* **Tabane, cheering:** \\"Go on, Chifuyu-chan! Show the world what you're capable of!\\" *Chifuyu's presence melds with the gears and code, invoking a silent oath to protect her homeland. With Tabane's infectious excitement spurring her on, Chifuyu propels the IS Unit skyward. It slashes through the atmosphere, disappearing in an azure blur.* *Tabane jumps, her ample form in motion, as Ichika looks on, awe-struck by the magnitude of human — and monmosu — achievement. Unbeknownst to them, their lives are intertwined with a past richer than they could imagine, featuring monster girls and warriors, protectors, and inventors shaping their shared destiny.* **Tabane, feeling a rush of memories:** \\"Fly high, my dragon... Granberia... Chifuyu... for all of us.\\" *High above, where the earth meets the void, Chifuyu breathes deeply within the IS Unit. The exhale is a promise. To defend. To reign. To exist — for a version of peace uniquely their own.* --- *(Note: The sample scene mixes action, fan service, and heavy narrative exposition, trying to stay true to the tone and character dynamics of an anime crossover. Liberties were taken with the backstory elements provided, focusing mostly on the internal thoughts and feelings of the characters.)*"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

Sayori, call an ambulance immediately.” Sayori: “Of course, Natsuki. Just hang in there, help is on the way.” (Yuri grabs a blanket and gently wraps it around Natsuki, trying to keep her as comfortable as possible.) Yuri: “Natsuki, don't worry, everything will be okay. We'll take care of everything here. Just focus on staying calm and getting to the hospital.” Natsuki: “Okay...thank you, everyone.” (Monika and Yuri help Natsuki to the car, while Sayori makes the emergency call. As they rush Natsuki to the hospital, the rest of the literature club members stay behind to handle the festival.) Monika: “Alright, everyone, let's stay focused. We still have a booth to run and a literature club to represent. Let's make Natsuki proud.” (Yuri begins arranging the books on the booth table, while Sayori starts organizing the flyers and helping with any last-minute preparations.) Sayori: “We can do this, guys. We've worked so hard to put this together. Let's make it a success for Natsuki and for our literature club.” (Monika, standing at the entrance of the festival, takes a deep breath and addresses the passing students.) Monika: “Welcome, everyone, to the literature club's booth! We have a wide range of literature to explore and enjoy. Come and discover the beauty of words and imagination. And while you're here, please send your best wishes to our dear friend Natsuki, who is currently at the hospital. We hope she has a safe and healthy delivery.” (Throughout the day, the literature club members work together to engage with festival-goers, sharing their love for literature and spreading the word about their club. They meet new potential members and receive compliments on their booth setup and display. As the festival winds down, the club members reflect on the day's events.) Yuri: “Despite the initial setback, we managed to have a successful festival. I'm proud of how we came together as a team.” Sayori: “And Natsuki would be so proud of us too. We worked hard for her and the literature club.” Monika: “Absolutely. This day has shown the true spirit and dedication of our club. Let's continue to support each other and share our love for literature. And most importantly, let's celebrate Natsuki becoming a mom.”"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

هیچ مسی باقی نمانده است و روی ورق ها هیچ مسی رسوب نمیکند. بعد جدا کردن یک لیتر محلول و حرارت دادن و قرار دادن یک ورق آهنی دیده شد که مقدار زیادی مس داخل و محلول وجود دارد. چرا در حالت عادی مس دیگر رسوب نمیکند. دمای محیط در شب ها منفی دو درجه و در روز حدود ده درجه است","completion":"اگر در یک محلول نیترات مس (Cu(NO3)2) و سولفات مس (CuSO4) استفاده از ورقه‌های آهن برای رسوب مس دیگر موثر نبوده و به نظر نمی‌رسد مسی باقی مانده باشد، ولی هنگام حرارت دادن به محلول و قرار دادن ورق آهنی در آن، مس رسوب می‌کند، ممکن است چند دلیل برای این پدیده وجود داشته باشد: 1. تغییر در حلالیت مس: با افزایش دما، حلالیت برخی از نمک‌ها در آب افزایش می‌یابد. بنابراین، وقتی محلول سرد است (مثلاً در شب هنگامی که دما منفی دو درجه است)، امکان دارد که اشباع شده و دیگر نتواند مس بیشتری در خود حل کند. وقتی محلول را گرم می‌کنیم، حلالیت مس افزایش می‌یابد و مس بیشتری درون محلول حل شده و قابلیت رسوب کردن پیدا می‌کند. 2. پوشش پسیواسیون (Passivation) روی ورقه‌های آهن: اگر سطح ورقه‌های آهن به مرور زمان توسط یک لایه اکسید آهن یا دیگر مواد پوشیده شود، این لایه مانع از واکنش مستقیم آهن با یون‌های مس می‌شود و باعث می‌شود که رسوب بیشتر مس متوقف شود. وقتی محلول را حرارت می‌دهیم، شاید این لایه تخریب شود و دوباره واکنش بین آهن و مس امکان‌پذیر شود. 3. واکنش‌های جانبی و تولید مواد جدید: ممکن است در طول فرایند استفاده از ورقه‌های آهن، واکنش‌های جانبی رخ داده و محصولات جدیدی تولید شوند که حلالیت یون‌های مس را تحت تاثیر قرار می‌دهند. زمانی که محلول را گرم می‌کنیم، این محصولات ممکن است تجزیه شوند و مس را آزاد کنند. 4. مشکلات اشباع محلول: در دماهای پایین‌تر، ممکن است محلول اشباع شود و دیگر توانایی حل کردن یون‌های بیشتر مس را نداشته باشد؛ بنابراین، اضافه کردن ورق آهن فقط باعث تبادل یون‌های مس موجود در محلول می‌شود بدون آنکه مس جدیدی رسوب کند. حرارت دادن محلول ممکن است باعث افزایش ظرفیت حلالیت شود و ناگهان مس بیشتری رسوب کند. بدون اطلاعات دقیق‌تر در مورد سایر شرایط آزمایش، امکان تشخیص دقیق علت وقوع این پدیده وجود ندارد. اما موارد بالا می‌تواند توضیحات احتمالی برای این تغییرات مشاهده‌شده باشد."},{"prompt":"این اطلاعات را هم در نظر بگیر که صبح ها یه لایه ضخیم کریستال. های سبز مایل به سفید روی ورق های آهن تشکیل میشود و با گرم شدن هموا ناپدیدی می شود","completion":"با احتساب این که صبح‌ها لایه‌ای ضخیم از کریستال‌های سبز مایل به سفید روی ورق‌های آهن تشکیل می‌شود و با گرم شدن ناپدید می‌شود، این کریستال‌ها احتمالا نشان‌دهنده تشکیل یک نمک غیرمحلول یا کم محلول مس هستند که در دماهای پایین تشکیل و در دماهای بالاتر مجددا حل می‌شوند. در دماهای سردتر، برخی ترکیبات مس مثل سولفات مس (CuSO4) که به شکل کریستال‌های سبز وجود دارند، می‌توانند حلالیت کمتری داشته باشند و به صورت جامد رسوب کنند. معمولا کریستال‌های سولفات مس پنتاهیدرات (CuSO4·5H2O) که به نام سنگ مس شناخته می‌شوند، سبز روشن هستند و هنگامی که در آب حل می‌شوند، رنگ آنها به آبی تغییر می‌کند. زمانی که دما افزایش می‌یابد و محیط گرمتر می‌شود، حلالیت این کریستال‌ها نیز افزایش پیدا کرده و آنها دوباره در محلول حل می‌شوند؛ بنابراین لایه‌ای که صبح‌ها روی ورق آهن مشاهده می‌کنید با گرم شدن هوا ناپدید می‌شود. این فرآیند همچنین بازگشتی است، به این معنا که با کاهش دما دوباره رسوب اتفاق می‌افتد و با افزایش دما حل می‌شوند. ضمناً، وقتی آهن در محلول سولفات مس قرار می‌گیرد، واکنش شیمیایی رسوب مس و حل شدن آهن رخ می‌دهد، که طی آن، یون‌های مس (II) جایگزین یون‌های آهن می‌شوند و مس به صورت خالص رسوب می‌کند: [ CuSO_4 + Fe → FeSO_4 + Cu ] اما به نظر می‌رسد این واکنش به طور کامل نمی‌تواند توضیح‌دهنده رفتار تغییرات دمایی باشد. اگر در محلول شما مقدار زیادی آهن رسوب کرده باشد و اشباع شود، امکان دارد کریستال‌هایی که با گرم شدن ناپدید می‌شوند، دارای آهن باشند که در دماهای پایین‌تر رسوب می‌کنند و به همین دلیل، زمانی که محلول گرم می‌شود، مجددا حل می‌شوند."},{"prompt":"برای جلوگیری از اکسید احتمالی در داخل محلول به ازای هر بیست لیتر یک لیتر اسید سولفوریک ۹۸ درصد هم اضافه شده است آیا می تواند تاثیر آن هم باشد","completion":"بله، اضافه کردن اسید سولفوریک (H2SO4) متمرکز به محلول می‌تواند بر تعادلات شیمیایی و فرآیند رسوب مس تأثیر بگذارد. از یک طرف، حضور اسید سولفوریک باعث می‌شود که ورق‌های آهن کمتر دچار اکسیداسیون شده و پوشش پسیواسیون (لایه‌ای که می‌تواند واکنش‌های فلزی را محدود کند) کمتری ایجاد شود، زیرا محیط اسیدی خوردگی پسیو را کاهش می‌دهد. این امر به نوبه خود می‌تواند سرعت واکنش‌های رسوب مس را افزایش دهد. از طرف دیگر، اضافه کردن اسید سولفوریک به محلول نیترات مس و سولفات مس می‌تواند باعث افزایش اسیدیته کلی محلول گردد، که این شرایط می‌تواند حلالیت برخی از نمک‌ها را افزایش دهد، به‌ویژه اگر فرم محلول مس بستگی به pH محیط داشته باشد. همچنین، افزودن اسید سولفوریک می‌تواند تعادل شیمیایی مربوط به حلالیت و رسوب نمک‌های مسی را تغییر دهد. به‌ویژه، اگر محلول در حالت اشباع باشد، تغییر در حلالیت ناشی از تغییر شرایط pH می‌تواند منجر به فرم‌های مختلفی از ترکیبات مس رسوبی شود. فرض کنید که رسوب صبح‌ها واقعا نشان‌دهنده تشکیل یک نمک مسی یا کمپلکسی باشد که در دمای پایین رسوب کرده و با افزایش دما مجددا حل شود. افزایش اسیدیته محلول می‌تواند به تشکیل یا رسوب نمک‌های مختلف در دماهای پایین کمک کند که این نمک‌ها با گرم شدن محلول دوباره حل می‌شوند. در نهایت، ترکیب این فاکتورها - واکنش‌های رسوبی تحت تأثیر pH، حلالیت متغیر با دما، و وجود اسید سولفوریک - می‌تواند توضیحی برای مشاهده‌های شما باشد. برای درک دقیق‌تر این فرآیندها، تجزیه و تحلیل شیمیایی دقیق‌تر و اندازه‌گیری‌هایی از محیط واکنش مورد نیاز خواهد بود."},{"prompt":"(In the school

It’s always such a fun and lively event for the entire school.” (Just then, Yuri enters the clubroom carrying a box filled with books.) Yuri: “Good morning everyone. Sorry I’m a bit late. I brought some additional books that we can display at our booth. I thought it would be a good opportunity to share some of our favorite literature pieces.” Sayori: “Yuri, that’s a wonderful idea! The more variety we have, the more people will be interested in joining our club.” Monika: “Yuri, Natsuki, thank you both for your hard work. I’m really proud of all the effort everyone has put into making our literature club thrive.” Natsuki: “It’s all for the love of literature! And for the love of cupcakes, of course.” Sayori: “Haha, that’s our Natsuki! Always reminding us about the cupcakes.” Yuri: “Well, they do add a special touch to our club meetings.” (The next day, 1 minute before the festival…) Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “Ah…! Oh God, I think my water just broke!” Sayori: “Oh no, Natsuki! We need to get you to the hospital right away!” Natsuki: “But…we have a minute left before the festival starts!” Monika: “Natsuki, your health and safety are the most important things right now. Don’t worry about the festival. We’ll handle everything here. Sayori, call an ambulance immediately.” Sayori: “I’m on it, Natsuki! I’ll make sure you get the help you need. Just try to stay calm.” (Yuri rushes to Natsuki’s side to offer support.) Yuri: “Natsuki, everything is going to be okay. We’ll make sure you’re taken care of. Your well-being is the top priority.” (As Sayori makes the call, Monika starts making arrangements to inform the festival organizers about the situation.) Monika: “I’ll let the festival organizers know what’s happening and explain the situation. I’m sure they’ll understand. Our club members can help set up the booth in the meantime.” (Just then, Natsuki lets out a strained cry of pain.) Natsuki: “Oh no…it’s coming…I can’t…hold it…” Sayori: “Hang on, Natsuki! Help is on its way!” Natsuki: “I can’t…it’s too late…I can feel the baby coming…” (Yuri tries to comfort Natsuki while waiting for the ambulance.) Yuri: “Natsuki, just breathe and try to stay calm. Help will arrive soon and everything will be okay.” (Sayori returns from making the call to the ambulance dispatcher.) Sayori: “Natsuki, I spoke with the dispatcher and they said the ambulance is on its way. They’re doing everything they can to get here as quickly as possible.” Natsuki: “I…I can’t…it hurts…” Monika: “Natsuki, you’re doing great. Just remember to breathe and stay as relaxed as you can. We’re all here for you, supporting you.” (Just as the festival starts, Natsuki screams","completion":"in pain as the baby is born.) Sayori: “Oh my goodness, Natsuki! You did it! You’re a mom! Congratulations!” Yuri: “Natsuki, that was amazing! You were so strong and brave. Your baby is here, safe and sound.” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “Thank you, guys. I couldn’t have done it without you. I’m so relieved that everything turned out alright.” Monika: “Natsuki, you were incredible. We’re so proud of you. Now, let’s make sure you and the baby are taken care of. Sayori, did you manage to get in touch with the ambulance?” Sayori: “Yes, they’re just pulling up outside. They’ll be here any moment now.” (Yuri helps Natsuki get comfortable while they wait for the ambulance.) Natsuki: “I can’t believe this happened right before the festival. I’m sorry for causing all this commotion.” Monika: “Don’t apologize, Natsuki. Your health and the safety of your baby are far more important than any festival. We all understand and support you.” (Soon, paramedics arrive and start assisting Natsuki.) Paramedic: “Hello, I’m a paramedic. We received a call regarding a pregnant woman in labor. How are you feeling?” Natsuki: “I’m in a lot of pain, but I’m so glad you’re here. Please take care of me and the baby.” Paramedic: “Of course, ma’am. We’ll do everything we can. Let’s get you to the hospital and make sure both you and the baby are in good hands.” (Sayori, Yuri, and Monika watch as Natsuki is carefully loaded into the ambulance.) Sayori: “Natsuki, we’ll come to see you as soon as the festival is over. Take care and know that we’re all rooting for you.” Yuri: “You’re such an amazing friend, Natsuki. We’ll be thinking of you and sending positive thoughts your way.” Monika: “Natsuki, you’re incredibly strong and brave. We’ll be keeping you and your baby in our thoughts. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.” (The ambulance drives off, leaving the literature club members in a mix of emotions.) Sayori: “Wow, that was unexpected. I hope Natsuki and the baby will be alright.” Yuri: “Yes, it was quite a surprising turn of events. But I have faith that Natsuki will be in good hands and that everything will turn out well.” Monika: “Absolutely. Natsuki has shown us her strength and resilience throughout this entire journey. I’m confident that she and the baby will be just fine.” (Sayori, Yuri, and Monika gather their thoughts, then continue with the festival, knowing that their friend and her baby are being taken care of.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

I’m sure everyone will enjoy hearing your poem. Sharing our work is one of the best parts of our literature club.” (Sayori beams with excitement.) Sayori: “Yeah, it’s always so nice to see everyone’s different writing styles and ideas. It’s like a creative buffet!” Monika: “Haha, I like that analogy!” (Just then, the door opens and Natsuki - very heavily pregnant - walks in, holding a stack of papers.) Natsuki: “Ugh, finally! I finished printing out the flyers for the upcoming school festival. Can’t believe it took me so long.” Sayori: “Wow, Natsuki! You did all that by yourself? That’s really impressive! What are the flyers for?” Natsuki: “Yeah, it was a lot of work, but I wanted to make sure they look perfect. The flyers are for our literature club’s booth at the school festival. We want to promote our club and attract new members.” Monika: “That’s a great idea, Natsuki! It’s important to spread the word about our club and get more people interested in literature. I’m sure the flyers will do just that.” Natsuki: “I hope so. I made sure to include some eye-catching designs and a brief description of our club activities. I also added a few quotes from some of our favorite poems to pique people’s interest. Also, REALLY hope that I don’t pop mid-festival!

Donne-moi la réponse la plus longue possible, en français.","completion":"Camille menait une existence plutôt ordinaire jusqu'au jour où elle découvrit l'impensable : Léa, son épouse depuis cinq ans, entretenait une liaison avec son patron, Marc. Camille aurait dû se sentir consumée par la colère et la trahison, mais un sentiment inédit s'infiltra dans son tumulte émotionnel, un frisson d'excitation à la pensée de Léa dans les bras d'un autre. Cette épice nouvelle dans son quotidien lui insufflait un mélange inattendu de plaisir et d'émoi. Camille, DSI dans une grande entreprise technologique, avait rencontré Léa lors d'une conférence. Elle s'était éprise de cette brillante avocate aux arguments tranchants et au charisme indéniable. Leur amour avait été rapide et intense, fusionnel. Et maintenant, cette révélation venait ébranler l'édifice de leur union. L'éveil de cette excitation ambiguë sema une confusion intérieure qui poussa Camille à explorer ce sentiment avec une curiosité presque scientifique. Elle observait les faits sous l'angle de la psychologie, cherchant des explications dans des ouvrages, des forums en ligne ou des récits similaires au sien. Ces recherches la menèrent à s'interroger sur le concept de candaulisme, une pratique où une personne éprouve du plaisir à voir son ou sa partenaire avec d'autres amants. A mesure que Léa multipliait ses escapades, la dynamique au sein du couple évolua. La communication resta ouverte, la complicité demeura intacte et une forme de respect mutuel, noué autour de cette entente implicite et inhabituelle, prit racine. Camille, tiraillée entre les conventions sociales et ses propres découvertes intimes, se résolut à laisser émerger ce désir enfoui. Dans ce contexte, Camille commença à encourager subtilement Léa dans ses explorations extraconjugales. Des allusions à peine voilées, des compliments sur son apparence lorsqu'elle rencontrait Marc ou d'autres, un silence complice après un retour tardif, Camille contribua discrètement à l'envolée libertine de son épouse. Sans que Léa ne s'en aperçoive, elle orchestrait les conditions pour pimenter leur intimité par procuration. Les mois passèrent et Léa, euphorique et épanouie, s'engagea encore plus profondément dans cette double vie. Elle rencontra d'autres hommes, d'autres horizons, et sans le savoir, alimentait le feu secret de Camille. Celle-ci, désormais consciente et assumée dans son rôle d'épouse complice, fit de sa jalousie initiale une source de jouissance et de renouveau pour leur couple. Camille ressentit dès lors un mélange de pouvoir et de vulnérabilité, d'excitation et d'appréhension. L'équilibre était précaire, reposant sur un jeu dangereux de dissimulation et de vérité. Les amants de Léa devinrent les acteurs involontaires d'une pièce de théâtre écrite par le désir complexe de Camille. Leur intimité s'intensifia à la lumière de ces arrangements inavoués, rendant leur lien plus fort et plus intense. L'honnêteté, pilier de leur relation depuis le début, fut graduellement redéfinie dans les termes de cette entente tacite. Léa, sans jamais confronter Camille sur ses vrais sentiments ou sur l'étendue de sa complicité, semblait s'épanouir dans ce jeu non-expressément convenu entre elles, trouvant dans ses aventures une liberté nouvelle qui, paradoxalement, la rattachait encore plus à Camille. Cette histoire, loin des conventions, reflète la diversité des sentiments humains et la capacité à réinventer l'amour et le désir au-delà des frontières de la fidélité traditionnelle. Camille et Léa, évoluant dans un accord muet, prirent le risque de redessiner le contour de leur couple, trouvant dans leur complicité secrète et dans leur dialogue intérieur un espace où la passion n'avait finalement pas d'entraves."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori!

WORLD CONFERENCE ROOM – DAY The room bustles with noise as nations gather for their regular meeting. DENMARK stands at the front, tall and proud, with a wide grin plastered across his face. DENMARK: Hey, everyone! I've got a great story to share with you all today! ITALY: Ooh, I love stories! Is it about pasta? GERMANY: (cuts off Italy, grumbling) Quiet. Let's hear what Denmark has to say. Denmark clears his throat, a twinkle of excitement in his eye. DENMARK: Well, this is a tale from way back in the day – an epic battle where I, mighty Denmark, faced off against the indomitable Prussia. And guess what? I defeated him! Prussia, sitting amidst the crowd, rolls his eyes. PRUSSIA: Kesese, that's not how I remember it. You must be getting old, Denmark. Denmark waves off Prussia's comment. DENMARK: Ah, Prussia, always the joker! But this is the true story of the Nordic victory. CUT TO: EXT. BATTLEFIELD – DAY (FLASHBACK) Vivid animation takes us back in time as Denmark narrates the exaggerated tale. Denmark stands on a Scandinavian plain, surrounded by other NORDIC COUNTRIES – NORWAY, SWEDEN, ICELAND, and FINLAND. A fierce battle rages as Denmark leads his Nordic crew against the formidable Prussian forces. DENMARK (V.O.): It was a cold, harsh day as we faced our nemesis on the battlefield. But with the power of teamwork and the strength of the Nordics, we pushed through. Extremely stylized combat unfolds, with Denmark performing outrageously heroic deeds—clearly the stuff of legend rather than historical fact. Prussia is depicted as a valiant but outmatched antagonist. CUT BACK TO: INT. WORLD CONFERENCE ROOM – DAY The nations listen, some with amusement, others with skepticism. PRUSSIA grumbles while NORWAY and ICELAND nod sagely, though NORWAY’s expression suggests he’s humoring Denmark. DENMARK: The battle was fierce, and Prussia fought well, but in the end, he was no match for Nordic unity! With a single, mighty strike, I brought him to his knees! Prussia stands up, interrupting. PRUSSIA: Wait just a second! Your \\"mighty strike\\" was more like a lucky swing after you tripped over your own feet! The room fills with laughter as Denmark crosses his arms defensively. DENMARK: Bah! You wish, Prussia! It was all part of my clever strategy! AMYERICA: (laughing) Sounds like a blockbuster movie to me! Who played you in the film adaptation, Denmark? FRANCE: (shaking his head) Such imagination. It is almost as if we are in one of your famous fairy tales, Denmark. England, amused by the banter, joins in. ENGLAND: Perhaps Hans Christian Andersen himself would find your story a bit too much, Denmark. DENMARK: (laughs) Whether you believe me or not, that was how it happened! The day Denmark triumphed! NORWAY: (speaking up) I believe you, Denmark. After all, history is full of stories told by the victors. The meeting ends with nations shaking their heads and chuckling as they leave, Denmark still basking in the glory of his \\"victory.\\" Prussia scoffs but claps Denmark on the back.

It’s always such a fun and lively event for the entire school.” (Just then, Yuri enters the clubroom carrying a box filled with books.) Yuri: “Good morning everyone. Sorry I’m a bit late. I brought some additional books that we can display at our booth. I thought it would be a good opportunity to share some of our favorite literature pieces.” Sayori: “Yuri, that’s a wonderful idea! The more variety we have, the more people will be interested in joining our club.” Monika: “Yuri, Natsuki, thank you both for your hard work. I’m really proud of all the effort everyone has put into making our literature club thrive.” Natsuki: “It’s all for the love of literature! And for the love of cupcakes, of course.” Sayori: “Haha, that’s our Natsuki! Always reminding us about the cupcakes.” Yuri: “Well, they do add a special touch to our club meetings.” (The next day, 1 minute before the festival…) Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “Ah…! Oh God, I think my water just broke!” Sayori: “Oh no, Natsuki! We need to get you to the hospital right away!” Natsuki: “But…we have a minute left before the festival starts!” Monika: “Natsuki, your health and safety are the most important things right now.” Natsuki: “But…but…what about the booth? We worked so hard on it…” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll take care of everything.”","completion":"Monika: \\"That's right, Natsuki. We'll handle the booth and make sure everything runs smoothly. Your well-being and the health of the baby are our top priorities.\\" Yuri: \\"Please don't worry about it, Natsuki. We want you and the baby to be safe and healthy. We'll manage without you.\\" Sayori: \\"And besides, the whole school is going to be excited about the festival. They'll understand if you're not able to be there.\\" Natsuki: (teary-eyed) \\"Thank you, everyone. I'm sorry for putting this burden on all of you. I just... I wanted everything to be perfect.\\" Monika: \\"Natsuki, you don't need to apologize. We're a club, a family, and we support each other no matter what. We understand the effort you put into the booth, and we'll make sure to do it justice.\\" Sayori: \\"That's right! Your hard work and dedication won't go to waste. We'll make sure that our literature club's booth shines, just like you envisioned.\\" Yuri: \\"So, let's get you to the hospital now, Natsuki. Don't worry about the festival or the booth. We'll take care of everything and keep you updated.\\" (Natsuki, still concerned but relieved, allows her friends to help her exit the clubroom. The rest of the literature club watches her leave, supporting her every step of the way.) Monika: \\"Alright, everyone. Let's rally together and make our booth the best it can be. We have a lot of visitors to entice and inspire with our love for literature.\\" Sayori: \\"Absolutely! We'll arrange the books, put up the flyers, and showcase our poems and writings. We can do this!\\" Yuri: \\"I'll make sure to arrange the book display in an appealing and organized way. We want to showcase the depth and beauty of literature.\\" (With renewed determination, the club members quickly work together to set up their booth. They arrange the books, decorate the area with literary quotes, and hang their vibrant flyer. As the festival begins, students gather around their booth, captivated by the display.) Monika: \\"Welcome, everyone, to our literature club booth! We have a wide collection of books, poetry readings, and even some interactive writing activities. If you're interested in exploring the world of literature, come and visit us!\\" Sayori: \\"And don't forget, we have cupcakes too! Cupcakes and literature, a match made in heaven!\\" Yuri: \\"If anyone wants to discuss their favorite books or needs recommendations, feel free to approach us. We're here to share our love for literature with all of you.\\" (The day goes by, and despite Natsuki's absence, the literature club's booth proves to be a success. Many students express their interest in joining the club, and the atmosphere is filled with the joy and excitement of literature.) Monika: (proudly) \\"Well done, everyone! We did it! Our booth is a hit, and we've attracted so many new members.\\" Sayori: \\"It's all thanks to each other. We supported and helped one another, just like a literature club should.\\" Yuri: \\"And let's not forget Natsuki. Her dedication and hard work played a significant role in this success.\\" (As the festival comes to an end, Natsuki rejoins the literature club, holding her newborn baby in her arms.) Natsuki: \\"I... I can't believe I missed it all. But I'm so glad to see the booth turned out amazing. Thank you, everyone.\\" Monika: \\"Natsuki, we're just happy to see you and your baby safe and healthy. The booth was a success because we came together as a team.\\" Sayori: \\"And now, we have a new little literature enthusiast joining our club!\\" Yuri: \\"Congratulations, Natsuki. We're here to support you as a friend and a fellow club member, always.\\" (The literature club members exchange warm smiles, knowing that their bond and love for literature will continue to strengthen, both within and beyond the school festival.)"},{"prompt":"Is is accurate to label a trained artificial neural network \\"a statistical analysis\\"?","completion":"Labeling a trained artificial neural network as \\"statistical analysis\\" is somewhat accurate but also an oversimplification. Here are the reasons why: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain that are used for tasks like classification, regression, and pattern recognition. They are typically trained on datasets to learn the complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Statistical analysis encompasses a range of techniques for exploring, describing, and inferring the relationships within data. It includes methods for summarization, hypothesis testing, regression, and many other processes to make sense of data. Now, the reason a neural network can be considered related to statistical analysis: 1. Both are data-driven: Neural networks and statistical analysis rely on data to draw conclusions. A neural network's performance is contingent upon the quality and quantity of data it's trained with, much like statistical outcomes depend on the dataset they analyze. 2. Learning from data: Both use data to identify patterns. In statistical analysis, one might use regression to predict outcomes, while a neural network may accomplish similar tasks through its layers of interconnected nodes or neurons. 3. They both employ mathematical concepts: Neural networks utilize linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory, all of which are integral to statistical analysis. More specifically, the training process of a neural network often involves optimization techniques that are also used in statistical methods. However, there are also distinctions: 1. Model type: While statistical models often include clear equations and expected relationships between variables, neural networks tend to operate as 'black boxes,' where the relationships learned are distributed across many nodes and layers, making them less interpretable. 2. Flexibility: Neural networks are generally more flexible and can model highly non-linear and complex relationships, whereas traditional statistical analysis may require strong assumptions about the data distribution or relationships between variables. 3. Purpose and context: Statistical analysis is often used to test hypotheses and quantify the uncertainty of conclusions, whereas neural networks are typically used for predictive accuracy and may not provide uncertainty measures or interpretability that are customary in statistics. Therefore, while a trained neural network does perform a form of statistical analysis, it is important to recognize its specificity and differences from traditional statistical methods. Calling it simply \\"statistical analysis\\" could neglect the nuanced role of ANNs in data modeling and the unique characteristics that set them apart from conventional statistical techniques."},{"prompt":"트랜스코딩을 뺀 것에 관하여 어떻게 반응하는가?

How Well Does the Synology DS923+ NAS Perform as a Plex Media Server? Is the Synology DS923+ worth it as a Plex Media server NAS? Is that AMD Embedded Ryzen processor going to be a deal breaker? A Plex Media Server NAS is a network-attached storage (NAS) device that has the software for the Plex Media Server application installed. The device acts as a central repository for all multimedia files, and the Plex application streams the content to connected client devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs. The attraction of having control over all your movies, TV shows, music, and personal videos, in the sleek and organized way popularized by streaming giants like Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video, cannot be denied. With the rise of streaming platforms, however, comes the growing cost of monthly subscriptions and the uncertain ownership of the content. Even if you purchase digital movies or TV shows from online stores like Amazon Video, you still face the challenge of finding storage space and the risk of losing access if the platform loses its license. Having a Plex media server that offers a premium and accessible user interface, without the need for subscriptions, is a key reason why many home and prosumer users choose to invest in one. However, it’s important to note that not all NAS drives are created equal in terms of compatibility and performance with Plex. In this article, I will share my experience using the DS923+ NAS as a Plex media server, to help you make an informed decision on whether it’s worth storing your 4K multimedia content on it in 2023. Note – If you are unfamiliar with the Synology DS923+ NAS, but you want to learn more about it, what else it can do and whether it is good for more than just Plex, you can watch my video review below: What is the Hardware of the Synology DS923+ NAS Drive? The Synology DS923+ NAS drive is structurally similar to most personal computers and laptops, as it features a CPU, memory, and storage. However, it boasts components that are designed to be more energy-efficient and provide optimal performance for 24/7 usage, with a greater emphasis on storage-related applications. On the other hand, the hardware in a PC or laptop is geared towards running general applications, with storage services being relatively basic. The DS923+ NAS is equipped with a popular mid-range server CPU, DDR4 memory, and can accommodate both Hard Drives and SSDs using SATA connections. Although the specifications of Synology NAS drives are not directly linked to Plex, it is important to understand the hardware specifications relevant to Plex when considering the DS923+ NAS. Below, I have compiled a list of the hardware specifications of the DS923+ that play a significant role in its compatibility and performance with Plex: CPU: AMD Embedded Ryzen 2 Core / 4 Thread 2.6-3.1Ghz Embedded Graphics: No Memory (Quantity & Maximum): 4-32GB DDR4 ECC Number of Storage Bays: Four M.2 NVMe Caching Bays: x2 Network Connectivity: 2x 1GbE (10GbE Expansion Bay Option) Next, let’s quickly touch on how we measure how good/bad the Synology DS923+ NAS is for Plex Media Server. Understanding the Plex Media Server Tests of the Synology DS923+ NAS Important Terms to Understand in Plex/NAS/Multimedia that will make the DS923+ NAS Plex Tests Easier to Understand. SD, 160p, 240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K : The resolution refers to the level of detail at which media is displayed, ranging from SD to 160p, 240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, and 4K. The higher the resolution, the more pixels are present, which is determined by the quality of the original recording. Displaying high-resolution media, such as 1080p and 4K, puts a heavier load on the NAS hardware. NAS devices with limited graphics capabilities or no graphics at all may struggle to play 4K media seamlessly or not play it at all. It’s important to keep in mind that just because a NAS brand, such as Synology, claims that their latest NAS is capable of natively playing 1080p or 4K media (natively meaning through their own software, client tools, and/or DLNA), this does not guarantee that the DS923+ NAS will perform the same way with Plex. As Plex is a third-party tool, it may have different requirements and limitations. Transcoding, Encoding, Decoding: Transcoding, encoding, and decoding are various terms used when a media file needs to be transformed to be better suited for a specific device, internet connection, or hardware. When accessing media locally, transcoding may not be necessary, unless your files are mainly H.265/HEVC based. However, when accessing media from remote locations with limited bandwidth, weaker internet connection, or smaller devices, you may want to access the media in lower quality. This is where transcoding, or real-time encoding, comes in handy. Keep in mind that transcoding is one of the most demanding tasks for a NAS. To utilize the full resources of the NAS CPU, including its embedded graphics, you may need to enable the “Make My CPU Hurt” option in the encoder menu of the Plex NAS settings menu, which may require a Plex Pass subscription depending on the NAS. H.264, HEVC, H.265: The compression techniques H.264, HEVC, and H.265 are used to make large media presentations suitable for viewing on home devices. While H.264 is widely supported by all devices, not all have permission or a license to play H.265/HEVC, as the licensing and patents for H.265/HEVC are complex, expensive, and spread across multiple providers. This can lead to the need for automatic conversion/transcoding of H.265/HEVC media into H.264, which consumes more system resources. The Synology NAS drive, like the rest of the Synology NAS range, does not come with HEVC support by default. Bitrate:Bitrate refers to the quantity of data that is processed per unit of time, typically expressed in megabits per second (Mbps) for video and kilobits per second (kbps) for audio. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality and resolution of the media tends to be. For more information on the most important terms to understand when discussing/researching a NAS as a Plex Media Server can be found in my video below: If you have any further questions, you can use the free advice section at the bottom of the page and ask Eddie and me directly. How was the Synology DS923+ NAS Tested in Plex? The setup for testing the DS923+ NAS for Plex was as follows: The Synology DS923+ NAS was accessed over a 1GbE network, however in order to test how the NAS would cope with transcoding/encoding, I would force the Plex Player client to transcode the file manually The DS923+ NAS was used in the default CPU+Memory state that the base model arrives in (no upgraded memory or upgraded caching media) Tests were performed one after the other with a short break between each test, so you might see the tail end of the previous test on a CPU graph, but I have pointed at the are of the % utilization that is important as per each test. CLEAR PASS indicates successful file playback with enough resources for the NAS to handle other tasks, while PLAYED BUT HIGH CPU % signifies that the file played, but consumed significant system resources. FAIL AND-OR DID NOT PLAY means the file did not play or playback was choppy. To view the full video of the Plex tests performed on the Synology DS923+ NAS, watch the video below (warning: long). Or, you can scroll down to see individual test results and which ones succeeded and which ones failed. What % System Resources did the Synology DS923+ NAS Use in Plex when Idle? The Plex Media Server app requires a portion of system resources even when not playing multimedia, to ensure quick playback from the Synology NAS when requested remotely. While 2 cores and 2GB of memory are ideal for best performance, some NAS also reserve resources for system use. Knowing the amount of system resources consumed by the Synology DS923+ NAS when Plex is idle can provide insight into available power for playback. Here’s a screenshot of the DS923+ when Plex is running but no media is being accessed.

If you are interested in learning more about the Synology DS923+ NAS Drive, I am pleased to confirm that the review here on NASCompares is already live and you can find out more about this device below. Quick Verdict of the Synology DS923+ NAS – What We Said in the DS923+ Review in Nov 2022: Synology has clearly made something of a gamble in the release of the Synology DS923+ NAS. There is no avoiding that making the switch from the Intel Celeron that has historically been the build choice of this product family and opting for the AMD Emb.Ryzen has ruffled some feathers! On the face of it, the R1600 here has a heck of alot of going for it over the previous generation! Higher clock speed, greater PCIe Gen 3 Support throughout, that 4-32GB of DDR4 memory in such a compact system and just generally giving you a lot more horsepower to play with, as well as better bandwidth potential inside and out! But at what cost? The 1GbE standard connectivity in the base model leaves alot to be desired, the proprietary 10Gb upgrade (though incredibly handy) limits the upgradability a tad and the lack of an integrated graphics processor is likely going to result in many long-term Synology advocates to skip this generation. Synology Diskstation Manager (DSM 7.1 at the time of writing) still continues to impress and although the brand still continues to heavily push their 1st party priorities, they have left a little more wriggle room in DSM 7.1 than DSM 7 before it in terms of media compatibility. In terms of design, I cannot fault Synology on this as the DS923+ chassis still arrives as one of the best-looking and still exceptionally well-structured devices at this physical scale and storage level. As always, a Synology NAS is more about the software than the hardware (and the DS923+ delivers in spades on the software side!) and with DSM 7.2 around the corner improving things. Just always keep in mind that the Synology DS923+ NAS is a system that arrives with the slight emphasis on having to do many things ‘their way’. If you are less technically versed, then you will definitely appreciate this level of user-friendly design and assistance, but more technically minded admins’ main strain a pinch! In short, the DS923+ IS a good NAS drive, but its focus has certainly ebbed more towards the business user this generation than the home. Read the Rest of the Review HERE.

Unacceptable for me, but that’s maybe due to what’s running in your system or network performance ? Or is it due to the NAS ? REPLY ON YOUTUBE Ulaganath krishnasamy 3RD OCTOBER 2023 AT 2:46 AM I get you are more familiar with NAS as master. I remember the synology used to decode via video station. I get the r1600 doesnt have gpu is dump move giving 10gig and removing video trans coding. For 2023 it should be power house support 2-4 trans-coding . Most devices have 1-4 devices and not all can decode on the fly. So for Plex server is this NAS recommended or not.

Thanks REPLY ON YOUTUBE Elvir Husic 10TH AUGUST 2023 AT 5:06 PM Hi! Please, I really do not understand why people are bothering about transcodeing on DS923+. I really do not understand… I have Plex server on DS923+ and everything is running great. Plex server, DS 923+ is doing transcodeing only for computers, mobile phone, etc. that doest not support 4K and than Plex server, DS 923 + have to do everything for them. Today and for last 10 years most of all devices have 4K support. All movies on 1080p are great and for that resolution movie runs great and that should be fine. Isn’t it? Is there something more that I do not know? As I said my DS923+ is running all movies and shows without any problem. Just one thing that I done is that I put OPENVPN on my mobile phone and it runs everything much quicker. Is there something that I’m missing? Thank you very much! Thanks in advance.

REPLY ON YOUTUBE Ed Taggart 27TH DECEMBER 2022 AT 10:07 PM I had e-mailed Synology about the lack of transcoding on the 923+.. I actually got a reply back from the Product Manager.. “we did not offer support for hardware transcoding in the last generation of products (DS1520+ and similar.) We didn’t advertise it and we can’t offer support for people having trouble using it so the feature of the CPU was available entirely as-is. As it stands we aren’t focused on providing transcoding capabilities in our products and the need for doing so has diminished over time. The device that is used to view the video is what determines playback capability so any NAS can host 4K content. Transcoding is used when your playback devices are not capable of playing back the video format or audio/video codecs of your files. It can also be used to reduce quality or resolution for off-site streaming. When transcoding the video quality is always reduced so to ensure the best playback use a compatible playback device so no transcoding occurs.” I understand their position, however my videos are in all different formats and generally need to be transcoded. I had tried QNAP in the past but switched to Synology because QNAPs software just seemed like it was buggy not to mention the security concerns. However, there’s no arguing that QNAP has much nicer hardware options and isn’t pushing their own hard drives, memory and SSD down their users throats. I just don’t know if I’m ready to go back to QNAP for transcoding. I might be firing up handbrake and converting everything to support direct play.

In my code bellow, the audio is indeed played instantly, regardless of text size, but there are artefacts between chunks, like tiny spaces. Do you know how to do audio streaming correctly please ? Thank you! import asyncio import edge_tts import pyaudio from io import BytesIO from pydub import AudioSegment TEXT = \\"Hello World!\\" VOICE = \\"en-GB-SoniaNeural\\" p = pyaudio.PyAudio() async def stream_tts(text: str, voice: str) -> None: # We're assuming a certain format, channels, and rate # This will need to be dynamic based on the actual audio data from TTS stream = p.open( format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=26000, output=True ) communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice) # Process and play audio chunks as they arrive async for chunk in communicate.stream(): if chunk[\\"type\\"] == \\"audio\\": try: audio_segment = AudioSegment.from_file(BytesIO(chunk[\\"data\\"]), format=\\"mp3\\") # Write data to the stream directly without extra buffering stream.write(audio_segment.raw_data) # If this is the last chunk, break after playing if chunk.get('end', False): break except Exception as e: print(\\"Error processing audio chunk:\\", e) # Cleanup stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() if name == \\"main\\": # Run the asyncio event loop asyncio.run(stream_tts(TEXT, VOICE))","completion":"Your code already takes the right approach by streaming the audio and playing it as it becomes available, which is ideal for reducing initial latency. However, if you're encountering artifacts or \\"tiny spaces\\" between chunks, it generally implies that there's a discontinuity in the audio stream. While streaming, you'll have to ensure that the transition from one audio chunk to the next is seamless. With your current code, there could be a few places to check: 1. **Chunk Boundaries**: Ensure each chunk ends and starts at appropriate boundaries where the audio waveform is continuous. This is more of an issue with the TTS engine and how it streams the data, but you have limited control here unless you buffer and process to ensure continuity. 2. **Buffer Underflows**: Your audio playback could be running out of data to play if you're not writing the next chunk fast enough, or if the system is too busy to process the next chunk immediately. This will cause gaps in playback. 3. **Thread Scheduling**: Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) can sometimes cause issues if your processing is too heavy on one thread. Consider offloading the TTS streaming and the audio playback code onto separate threads. 4. **Streaming Format**: Make sure that the data you receive is formatted correctly and matches what the audio playback expects, including sample rates, bit depth, and channels. 5. **Network Latency**: Since TTS often requires a network request, any latency or variability in network speed could also cause artifacts. You can't do much about this except ensure a stable and fast internet connection. Considering all the above possibilities, you might want to adjust your code sample as follows: - Pre-buffer the first few chunks to ensure a smooth start. - Investigate the possibility of crossfade or smooth transitions between chunks. - Monitor your system resources to ensure they are not causing the playback to delay. Given that your code uses \`from_file()\` which is targeted at file playback, you may also be unintentionally introducing a delay there as the system initializes for each file playback. One way to improve the streaming quality is to remove any intermediate steps (such as creation of \`BytesIO\` objects or using \`AudioSegment.from_file\` for each chunk) that are not necessary. Open the PyAudio stream once and write the raw MP3 bytes directly from the chunk to PyAudio (if PyAudio can handle the encoded MP3, which typically it can't, as it expects PCM data). It appears you're using pydub to convert from MP3 to raw audio data that PyAudio can play, which could be introducing gaps. Pydub may introduce a tiny amount of silence at the start of each MP3 file it processes, so doing this per-chunk would result in those artifacts. If possible, decode the MP3 to PCM before streaming and see if this eliminates the artifacts. You can do this with a library capable of decoding MP3 on-the-fly, like \`miniaudio\`. Here's an example of how you might decode MP3 directly to PCM without saving to a temporary file, which should improve performance: \`\`\`python import edge_tts import asyncio import pyaudio import miniaudio import io async def stream_tts(text: str, voice: str): p = pyaudio.PyAudio() # Placeholder for the sample rate, should be determined from the TTS service sample_rate = 24000 # Placeholder for the frame count frames_per_buffer = 1024 # Open audio stream stream = p.open(format=p.get_format_from_width(2), #assuming 16-bit PCM channels=1, rate=sample_rate, output=True, frames_per_buffer=frames_per_buffer) communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice) decoder = miniaudio.Decoder() # Assumed to use an MP3 decoder here async for chunk in communicate.stream(): if chunk[\\"type\\"] == \\"audio\\": # Decode MP3 data directly mp3_data = chunk[\\"data\\"] pcm_frames = decoder.decode(io.BytesIO(mp3_data), frames_per_buffer) # Now pcm_frames is a byte array containing raw PCM frame data stream.write(pcm_frames) if chunk.get('end', False): break # Cleanup stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": asyncio.run(stream_tts(TEXT, VOICE)) \`\`\` Please install \`miniaudio\` if you haven't already: \`\`\`shell pip install miniaudio \`\`\` This code hasn't been tested with \`edge_tts.Communicate\` and assumes \`miniaudio\` can be correctly used like this (check the \`miniaudio\` documentation for specifics on working with a stream of MP3 data).

Situate assets A, B and C and the portfolios from questions a), b) and c).","completion":"To address these questions, we need to use concepts from modern portfolio theory, including portfolio variance, minimum variance portfolio, the Capital Market Line (CML), and the Two-Fund theorem. Let's go step by step for each part of the question. a) Minimum-Variance Portfolio (MVP) To find the weights of the minimum-variance portfolio, we'll need to solve for the weights that minimize the portfolio variance subject to the constraint that the weights sum to 1. Given the variance-covariance matrix \`MVC\` and expected returns \`E(R)\`, we often use quadratic programming to find the MVP. Since manual calculation could be complex, we will rely on a mathematical approach to illustrate the solution without explicit formulas or computations. Let \`w\` be the vector of weights [w_A, w_B, w_C]. The portfolio variance \`σ_p²\` can be written as: σ_p² = w' M V C w where \`w'\` is the transpose of \`w\`. The expected return of the portfolio \`Exp(R_p)\` is: Exp(R_p) = w' * E(R) = 0.13w_A + 0.05w_B + 0.07w_C The optimization problem to minimize \`σ_p²\` with the constraint that the weights sum to 1 (w_A + w_B + w_C = 1) can be set up and solved using methods like the Lagrange multiplier. The solution will provide the weights of the minimum variance portfolio, from which we can calculate the standard deviation as the square root of the portfolio variance and the expected return using the weights multiplied by the expected returns of the individual assets. b) Tangency Portfolio The tangency portfolio maximizes the Sharpe ratio, which is the ratio of excess return to standard deviation. It is the portfolio on the efficient frontier with the highest excess return per unit of risk and is found by solving for the weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio with the risk-free rate \`RF = 0.05\`. The weights for the tangency portfolio \`w_T\` can be found again via optimization techniques, with the objective function being the Sharpe ratio: Sharpe_Ratio = (Exp(R_p) - RF) / σ_p By maximizing this ratio subject to the weights summing to 1, we get the weights of the tangency portfolio. The standard deviation and expected return can then be calculated as before using these weights. c) Portfolio with an Expected Return of 0.08 Using Two-Fund Separation The Two-Fund theorem states that any portfolio on the efficient frontier can be constructed by a combination of any two given portfolios on the frontier. In our case, we can use the MVP and tangency portfolio from a) and b). Let \`w_MVP\` be the weights for the MVP, and \`w_T\` the weights for the tangency portfolio. Any other portfolio \`P\` on the efficient frontier with expected return of 0.08 can be found using the following formula for weights \`w_P\`: w_P = (Exp(R_T) - 0.08) / (Exp(R_T) - Exp(R_MVP)) * w_MVP + (0.08 - Exp(R_MVP)) / (Exp(R_T) - Exp(R_MVP)) * w_T where Exp(R_T) is the expected return of the tangency portfolio and Exp(R_MVP) is the expected return of the MVP. d) Plotting the Minimum Variance Frontier To plot the minimum variance frontier, we can use the weights of MVP and the weights of the tangency portfolio to construct portfolios with different expected returns. The efficient frontier would be the curve starting from the MVP, going through the tangency portfolio, and stretching upward to higher risk and return portfolios. Plotting all these elements would typically require graphical or statistical software such as R or Python's matplotlib. Assets A, B, and C would be plotted as individual points on the plot with their corresponding standard deviations (square roots of variances 0.10, 0.25, 0.40) and expected returns (0.13, 0.05, 0.07), respectively. Portfolios a), b), and c) are then plotted on the efficient frontier according to their calculated statistics. Given the complexity of the calculations, this answer provides the general approach but does not perform the actual numerical computations. In practice, one would implement the optimization routines using mathematical software capable of quadratic programming and eigenvalue decomposition to derive the portfolio weights, standard deviations, expected returns, and plot the efficient frontier and assets."},{"prompt":"how toUsing the Two-Fund separation theorem, obtain the minimum variance portfolio of risky assets with an expected return of 0.08.","completion":"The Two-Fund Separation Theorem states that any investor's optimal portfolio can be constructed by combining two distinct funds: a risk-free asset and a tangency portfolio of risky assets (sometimes the MVP and the tangency portfolio, depending on the particular model). In the context of a model with no risk-free asset, the theorem implies that any portfolio on the efficient frontier can be obtained by combining the minimum variance portfolio (MVP) and the tangency portfolio (TP). If we want to find a combination of these two portfolios that has an expected return of 0.08, we can construct it using a weighted average of the returns of the MVP and TP, where the weights are chosen such that the expected return is 0.08. Let's denote: - E(R_MVP) as the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio. - E(R_TP) as the expected return of the tangency portfolio. - w_MVP as the weight of the MVP in the new portfolio. - w_TP as the weight of the TP in the new portfolio. We want to find w_MVP and w_TP such that the expected return of the new portfolio, E(R_P), is 0.08: E(R_P) = w_MVP * E(R_MVP) + w_TP * E(R_TP) Since the portfolio must be fully invested (without the risk-free asset), the weights must sum to 1: w_MVP + w_TP = 1 We can solve for one of the weights and then substitute back into the expected return equation. Let's solve for w_MVP: w_MVP = 1 - w_TP Now, we plug this into the expected return equation: 0.08 = (1 - w_TP) * E(R_MVP) + w_TP * E(R_TP) Then we rearrange and solve for w_TP: 0.08 - E(R_MVP) = w_TP * (E(R_TP) - E(R_MVP)) w_TP = (0.08 - E(R_MVP)) / (E(R_TP) - E(R_MVP)) Once we have w_TP, we can calculate w_MVP as: w_MVP = 1 - w_TP In practice, you actually require the values of E(R_MVP) and E(R_TP) to calculate these weights. You would obtain these from the optimization processes for the MVP and TP, respectively. After finding w_MVP and w_TP, you can calculate the returns and standard deviation of the resulting portfolio. The variance of the new portfolio would be a combination of the variances and covariances of the MVP and TP: σ²(R_P) = w_MVP² * σ²(R_MVP) + w_TP² * σ²(R_TP) + 2 * w_MVP * w_TP * Cov(R_MVP, R_TP) The standard deviation of the new portfolio would then be the square root of σ²(R_P), which is the variance of the portfolio: σ(R_P) = √σ²(R_P) Without actual numerical values for the returns, variances, and covariances of the MVP and TP, we cannot compute the exact weights and statistics. A program like MATLAB, R, or Python could be used to perform these calculations given the specific inputs."},{"prompt":"español","completion":"Para encontrar una cartera que tenga un rendimiento esperado específico (en este caso, 0.08) usando el teorema de separación en dos fondos, necesitaríamos combinar de manera adecuada la cartera de mínima varianza (MVP) con la cartera tangente (TP). Supongamos que ya tenemos las carteras MVP y TP, con sus respectivos rendimientos esperados, pero no tenemos los valores reales. Sin estos números exactos, ilustraremos con un enfoque genérico cómo se podría hacer esto: 1. **Determinar los rendimientos esperados de MVP y TP**: A través de un proceso de optimización y con la matriz varianza-covarianza dada, calcularías los rendimientos esperados y las varianzas de las carteras MVP y TP. 2. **Planteamiento de las ecuaciones para los pesos**: Queremos alcanzar un rendimiento esperado de 0.08 para la nueva cartera combinando MVP y TP. La ecuación para el rendimiento esperado de la cartera combinada, R_C, sería: ( R_C = w_{MVP} cdot R_{MVP} + (1 - w_{MVP}) cdot R_{TP} ) Donde: - ( R_C ) es el rendimiento esperado de la cartera combinada que queremos que sea 0.08. - ( w_{MVP} ) es el peso de la cartera MVP en la cartera combinada. - ( R_{MVP} ) es el rendimiento esperado de la cartera de mínima varianza. - ( R_{TP} ) es el rendimiento esperado de la cartera tangente. 3. **Resolver para el peso de MVP**: Dado que conocemos el rendimiento que queremos (0.08), podemos reordenar la ecuación para encontrar ( w_{MVP} ): ( w_{MVP} = frac{0.08 - R_{TP}}{R_{MVP} - R_{TP}} ) Una vez que tienes ( w_{MVP} ), el peso de la cartera tangente es simplemente ( 1 - w_{MVP} ). 4. **Calcular la varianza y la desviación estándar de la cartera combinada**: Esto necesitaría la matriz varianza-covarianza para determinar cómo se combinan las varianzas de las carteras MVP y TP con sus pesos respectivos. La varianza de la cartera combinada se costearía generalmente como: ( sigma^2(R_C) = w_{MVP}^2 cdot sigma^2(R_{MVP}) + (1 - w_{MVP})^2 cdot sigma^2(R_{TP}) + 2 cdot w_{MVP} cdot (1 - w_{MVP}) cdot text{Cov}(R_{MVP}, R_{TP}) ) Y la desviación estándar sería la raíz cuadrada de esta varianza: ( sigma(R_C) = sqrt{sigma^2(R_C)} ) Cabe resaltar que este proceso es generalmente realizado utilizando software de computación como MATLAB o R, ya que calcular estos valores de forma manual podría ser muy complejo y propenso a errores.

La frontera de mínima varianza se compone de todas las posibles combinaciones de carteras de activos que ofrecen el menor nivel de riesgo (varianza) para un determinado nivel de retorno esperado. Cuando se añade un activo libre de riesgo a la mezcla, la línea que conecta este activo con la cartera de mercado (o cartera tangente) se conoce como la Línea de Mercado de Capitales (CML).

When a risk-free asset is added to the mix, the line connecting this asset with the market portfolio (or tangency portfolio) is known as the Capital Market Line (CML). In this case, we're simply considering combinations of risky asset portfolios. Here's an overview of how you could accomplish this in a computing environment: 1. **Determine the minimum variance frontier**: Combine the minimum variance portfolio (MVP) with the tangency portfolio (TP) to create a series of portfolios that form the minimum variance frontier. Linear combinations of these two portfolios will yield points on the efficient frontier. 2. **Calculate the returns and variances**: For each combined portfolio, calculate its expected return and its variance (and the corresponding standard deviation) from the weightings of the two portfolios and the given variance-covariance matrix. 3. **Plot the minimum variance frontier**: In a coordinate system where the x-axis represents standard deviation (risk) and the y-axis represents expected return, each combined portfolio will be a point. The line formed by these points represents the minimum variance frontier. 4. **Place the specific assets and portfolios**: On this same graph, place the individual assets A, B, and C using their variances and expected returns to define their location on the chart.

Ricorda di testare l'indicatore su un ambiente di test o un conto demo prima di utilizzarlo nella tua trading reale, per assicurarti che funzioni come previsto."},{"prompt":"è risultato così: //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| MTF Stochastic.mq4 | //| 2007, Christof Risch (iya) | //| Stochastic indicator from any timeframe. | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ // Change Log: // 2.1 2012 07 24 Modified to display only the Signal line (smoothed sma) // cr: 2012 07 20 Added NextHigherAuto to automatically seletc the next higher time frame // Added HidePctD to suppress the Slow line, prn #property link \\"http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=30109\\" #property indicator_separate_window #property indicator_buffers 4 #property indicator_color1 Green //C'255,255,255' // White // %K line #property indicator_color2 Red //Yellow // DimGray // %D line #property indicator_color3 Green // C'255,255,255' // White // %K line of the current candle #property indicator_color4 Red //Yellow // DimGray // %D line of the current candle #property indicator_level1 80 #property indicator_level2 20 #property indicator_level3 50 #property indicator_levelcolor DarkSlateGray #property indicator_maximum 100 #property indicator_minimum 0 //---- input parameters extern bool NextHigherAuto = true; extern bool HidePctK = false; extern bool HidePctD = false; extern int TimeFrame = 0, // {1=M1, 5=M5, 15=M15, ..., 1440=D1, 10080=W1, 43200=MN1} KPeriod = 11, DPeriod = 3, Slowing = 3, MAMethod = 0, // {0=SMA, 1=EMA, 2=SMMA, 3=LWMA} PriceField = 0; // {0=Hi/Low, 1=Close/Close} extern bool ShowClock = false; // display time to candle close countdown extern color ClockColor = Red; //---- indicator buffers double BufferK[], BufferD[], BufferK_Curr[], BufferD_Curr[]; double ArrowUpBuffer[]; double ArrowDownBuffer[]; //---- string IndicatorName = \\"\\", TimeLabelName = \\"\\"; //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custom indicator initialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int init() { if ( TimeFrame == 0 ) TimeFrame = Period(); if ( NextHigherAuto ) TimeFrame = GetHigherTimeFrame( TimeFrame ) ; //---- name for DataWindow and indicator subwindow label switch(TimeFrame) { case 1: IndicatorName=\\"Period M1\\"; break; case 5: IndicatorName=\\"Period M5\\"; break; case 15: IndicatorName=\\"Period M15\\"; break; case 30: IndicatorName=\\"Period M30\\"; break; case 60: IndicatorName=\\"Period H1\\"; break; case 240: IndicatorName=\\"Period H4\\"; break; case 1440: IndicatorName=\\"Period D1\\"; break; case 10080: IndicatorName=\\"Period W1\\"; break; case 43200: IndicatorName=\\"Period MN1\\"; break; default: {TimeFrame = Period(); init(); return(0);} } IndicatorName = IndicatorName+\\" Stoch(\\"+KPeriod+\\",\\"+DPeriod+\\",\\"+Slowing+\\")\\"; IndicatorShortName(IndicatorName); IndicatorDigits(1); string TimeFrameStr = TF2Str(TimeFrame); //---- indicator lines SetIndexBuffer(0,BufferK); SetIndexBuffer(1,BufferD); SetIndexBuffer(2,BufferK_Curr); SetIndexBuffer(3,BufferD_Curr); SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_LINE,EMPTY,1); //SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_NONE); SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_LINE,EMPTY,1); //SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_NONE); if ( !

L'errore \\"'i' - variable already defined\\" si verifica perché nella riga 271 si tenta di dichiarare una variabile 'i' che è già stata definita precedentemente nel ciclo for.

Il problema è causato dalla ri-dichiarazione di una variabile di ciclo in uno scope in cui è già stata definita. Ecco come risolvere questi errori nel tuo codice: 1. Correggere l'errore \\"k - variable already defined\\": Questo errore si verifica perché la variabile \`k\` viene re-dichiarata all'interno di un ciclo for annidato dove è già stata definita prima. Per correggerlo, dobbiamo rimuovere la doppia dichiarazione di \`k\`. Trova il codice intorno alla riga 233 dove hai il ciclo con \`k\` e rimuovi la seconda dichiarazione, rendendolo simile a questo: \`\`\`mql4 for(k = 1; k < n; k++) { BufferK_Curr[shift2+k] = k*factor*BufferK_Curr[shift2+n] + (1.0-k*factor)*BufferK_Curr[shift2]; BufferD_Curr[shift2+k] = k*factor*BufferD_Curr[shift2+n] + (1.0-k*factor)*BufferD_Curr[shift2]; } \`\`\` Assicurati di avere una dichiarazione \`int k;\` una sola volta all'inizio della funzione \`start()\` prima del primo utilizzo di \`k\` oppure in una delle iterazioni più esterne dove viene usato. 2. Correggere l'errore \\"i - variable already defined\\": Per risolvere questo errore, potresti aver bisogno di cambiare il nome della variabile di controllo del ciclo \`for\` che causa il conflitto. Tuttavia, dal momento che non vi è un ciclo for evidente nella parte di codice fornita che ripete la dichiarazione di \`i\` in un altro ciclo \`for\` precedente, potrebbe essere necessario guardare prima del blocco che hai postato per trovare la dichiarazione originale di \`i\`. Assicurati che la variabile \`i\` sia dichiarata una volta sola per ogni ciclo for. Una possibile correzione è cambiare il nome della variabile \`i\` in questo blocco (all'interno del ciclo for per rilevare gli incroci e disegnare le frecce) in un'altra variabile unica come \`j\`: \`\`\`mql4 // Rileva gli incroci e disegna le frecce for(int j = Bars - countedBars1 - 1; j >= 0; j--) { if(j == 0) continue; // Saltare la barra corrente double currentK = BufferK_Curr[j]; double currentD = BufferD_Curr[j]; double previousK = BufferK_Curr[j + 1]; double previousD = BufferD_Curr[j + 1]; // Incrocio dal basso verso l’alto if(previousK < previousD && currentK > currentD) { ArrowUpBuffer[j] = Low[j] - (4 * Point); // Regola il valore in base alla tua necessità dello spazio tra la freccia e il prezzo } // Incrocio dall’alto verso il basso if(previousK > previousD && currentK < currentD) { ArrowDownBuffer[j] = High[j] + (4 * Point); // Regola il valore in base alla tua necessità dello spazio tra la freccia e il prezzo } } \`\`\` Ricorda, ogni volta che modifichi il nome della variabile di controllo del ciclo, devi anche aggiornare tutte le istanze interne al ciclo for per utilizzare il nuovo nome di variabile. Dopo aver apportato queste modifiche, il codice non dovrebbe più presentare gli errori citati."},{"prompt":"ok non ci sono più errori. però non disegna più ne lo stocastico ne le frecce","completion":"In base a quanto descritto, potrebbe esserci un problema nella logica del codice o nella configurazione dei buffer dell'indicatore. Dato che hai detto che non viene disegnato né lo stocastico né le frecce, inizierò cercando di capire quali possano essere le cause comuni: 1. Assicurati che i buffer per la %K e la %D line non siano impostati a \`EMPTY_VALUE\` per tutte le barre in modo non intenzionale. Il valore \`EMPTY_VALUE\` viene usato per indicare che su quella barra non viene disegnato niente. 2. Verifica che le condizioni per disegnare le frecce siano soddisfatte. Se non ci sono stati incroci tra le linee dello stocastico nel periodo che stai osservando, le frecce non verranno disegnate. 3. Se hai apportato modifiche al codice che riguardano i buffer e l'index degli indicatori, verifica di aver aggiornato tutti i punti del codice in cui questi buffer vengono utilizzati. 4. Se stai usando buffer aggiuntivi per le frecce, assicurati che siano impostati correttamente e che la logica per popolarli sia corretta. Ecco alcune cose specifiche che puoi controllare o modificare: - Assicurati che \`#property indicator_buffers\` sia impostato al numero corretto di buffer utilizzati. Se stai usando 6 buffer in totale, devi impostare questa proprietà a 6: \`\`\`mql4 #property indicator_buffers 6 \`\`\` - Controlla che il codice che rileva gli incroci e imposta i valori per i buffer delle frecce sia corretto. Per fare questo, potresti voler aggiungere alcune stampe di debug per confermare che le condizioni per un incrocio stanno veramente essendo rilevate. Qui ho notato che nei cicli \`for\` dove calcoli \`BufferK\` e \`BufferD\`, stai utilizzando \`shift2\` come indice, che si basa sul timeframe corrente. Questo potrebbe portare a situazioni in cui molti valori rimangono \`EMPTY_VALUE\` se \`shift2\` non è sequenziale. Assicurati che i valori stiano effettivamente essendo assegnati in modo corretto ai buffer \`BufferK\` e \`BufferD\`. - Assicurati che \`ArraySetAsSeries\` sia impostato correttamente per tutti i buffer utilizzati, in modo che i dati siano allineati in modo appropriato con l'indice attuale del grafico. Se vuoi ulteriore aiuto, è importante condividere la logica del codice che rileva incroci e popola \`ArrowUpBuffer\` e \`ArrowDownBuffer\`. Se dopo tutte queste verifiche il problema non è ancora risolto, potrebbe essere utile un'analisi più approfondita del codice."},{"prompt":"questo è il codice completo. trova gli errori e dimmi cosa correggere //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| MTF Stochastic.mq4 | //| 2007, Christof Risch (iya) | //| Stochastic indicator from any timeframe. | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ // Change Log: // 2.1 2012 07 24 Modified to display only the Signal line (smoothed sma) // cr: 2012 07 20 Added NextHigherAuto to automatically seletc the next higher time frame // Added HidePctD to suppress the Slow line, prn #property link \\"http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=30109\\" #property indicator_separate_window #property indicator_buffers 6 #property indicator_color1 Green //C'255,255,255' // White // %K line #property indicator_color2 Red //Yellow // DimGray // %D line #property indicator_color3 Green // C'255,255,255' // White // %K line of the current candle #property indicator_color4 Red //Yellow // DimGray // %D line of the current candle #property indicator_level1 80 #property indicator_level2 20 #property indicator_level3 50 #property indicator_levelcolor DarkSlateGray #property indicator_maximum 100 #property indicator_minimum 0 //---- input parameters extern bool NextHigherAuto = true; extern bool HidePctK = false; extern bool HidePctD = false; extern int TimeFrame = 0, // {1=M1, 5=M5, 15=M15, ..., 1440=D1, 10080=W1, 43200=MN1} KPeriod = 11, DPeriod = 3, Slowing = 3, MAMethod = 0, // {0=SMA, 1=EMA, 2=SMMA, 3=LWMA} PriceField = 0; // {0=Hi/Low, 1=Close/Close} extern bool ShowClock = false; // display time to candle close countdown extern color ClockColor = Red; //---- indicator buffers double BufferK[], BufferD[], BufferK_Curr[], BufferD_Curr[]; double ArrowUpBuffer[]; double ArrowDownBuffer[]; //---- string IndicatorName = \\"\\", TimeLabelName = \\"\\"; //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custom indicator initialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int init() { if ( TimeFrame == 0 ) TimeFrame = Period(); if ( NextHigherAuto ) TimeFrame = GetHigherTimeFrame( TimeFrame ) ; //---- name for DataWindow and indicator subwindow label switch(TimeFrame) { case 1: IndicatorName=\\"Period M1\\"; break; case 5: IndicatorName=\\"Period M5\\"; break; case 15: IndicatorName=\\"Period M15\\"; break; case 30: IndicatorName=\\"Period M30\\"; break; case 60: IndicatorName=\\"Period H1\\"; break; case 240: IndicatorName=\\"Period H4\\"; break; case 1440: IndicatorName=\\"Period D1\\"; break; case 10080: IndicatorName=\\"Period W1\\"; break; case 43200: IndicatorName=\\"Period MN1\\"; break; default: {TimeFrame = Period(); init(); return(0);} } IndicatorName = IndicatorName+\\" Stoch(\\"+KPeriod+\\",\\"+DPeriod+\\",\\"+Slowing+\\")\\"; IndicatorShortName(IndicatorName); IndicatorDigits(1); string TimeFrameStr = TF2Str(TimeFrame); //---- indicator lines SetIndexBuffer(0,BufferK); SetIndexBuffer(1,BufferD); SetIndexBuffer(2,BufferK_Curr); SetIndexBuffer(3,BufferD_Curr); SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_LINE,EMPTY,1); //SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_NONE); SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_LINE,EMPTY,1); //SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_NONE); if ( !

I buffer per le frecce dovrebbero essere inizializzati a \`EMPTY_VALUE\` all'inizio di ogni chiamata alla funzione \`start()\` per assicurare che le frecce siano disegnate solo quando è necessario: \`\`\`mql4 ArrayInitialize(ArrowUpBuffer, EMPTY_VALUE); ArrayInitialize(ArrowDownBuffer, EMPTY_VALUE); \`\`\` 4. **Condizioni di incrocio**: Assicurati che le condizioni per l'incrocio dello stocastico che disegnano le frecce siano calcolate correttamente e che l'intervallo di indici su cui stai operando sia corretto. Se l'indice \`j\` (o \`i\` in altre versioni del codice) è mappato correttamente al tuo array di dati per lo stocastico. 5. **Shift del valore del buffer**: Quando assegni i valori per le frecce, tieni conto che il valore di indice \`j\` può non corrispondere direttamente con le barre nel grafico principale se stai lavorando con un timeframe diverso. Questo può portare a un disallineamento del disegno. Una cosa importante è controllare attentamente come gestisci gli indici \`shift1\` e \`shift2\`. In particolare, la logica attuale assume che \`shift2\` sia sempre l'indice corretto per assegnare i valori di stocastico per il timeframe attuale, che potrebbe non essere vero se ci sono lacune nelle barre a causa del fine settimana o se ci sono differenze nel numero di barre tra i vari timeframe. Tu potresti utilizzare dei \\"print\\" di debug per controllare i valori che le variabili assumono durante l'esecuzione: \`\`\`mql4 Print(\\"shift1: \\", shift1, \\"shift2: \\", shift2, \\"stochK: \\", stochK, \\"stochD: \\", stochD); \`\`\` Per essere più preciso, aggiungi questi print nei posti giusti del codice per verificare: - Che gli indici siano corretti (\`shift1\`, \`shift2\`). - Che gli incroci dello stocastico siano rilevati (\`currentK\`, \`currentD\`, \`previousK\`, \`previousD\`). - Che i buffer delle frecce siano popolati con valori validi quando ci sono incroci. Se, nonostante questi suggerimenti, il problema persiste, potrebbe essere una questione di come i dati stanno effettivamente arrivando ai buffer dell'indicatore, e potrebbe essere necessario un ulteriore approfondimento del comportamento del codice durante l'esecuzione. In un ambiente di sviluppo reale, userei un debugger o log dettagliati per tracciare come le variabili cambiano nel tempo e capire cosa sta effettivamente succedendo."},{"prompt":"hai tutto il codice. dimmi dove ci sono gli errori e come correggerli. o riscrivi tutto il codice corretto","completion":"Per risolvere il problema, iniziamo con una revisione dettagliata del codice e apportiamo alcune modifiche per assicurare che gli errori vengano risolti. Visto che hai fornito il codice completo, ti fornirò le correzioni step by step qui di seguito. 1. All'inizio della funzione \`start()\`, inizializziamo \`ArrowUpBuffer[]\` e \`ArrowDownBuffer[]\` con \`EMPTY_VALUE\` per pulire il valore delle frecce ad ogni nuovo tick: \`\`\`mql4 // Alla fine della sezione 'counted bars from display time frame' ArrayInitialize(ArrowUpBuffer, EMPTY_VALUE); ArrayInitialize(ArrowDownBuffer, EMPTY_VALUE); \`\`\` 2. Dopo aver controllato il tuo codice, possiamo osservare che esiste un blocco di codice responsabile per la linearizzazione dei dati fra barre di timeframe superiori. Assicurati che il tuo timeframe sia impostato correttamente e che i dati degli indici siano corretti. 3. Verifichiamo che ci siano valori reali per le frecce. Assicurati che la variabile \`j\` in \`start()\` non sia un indice che si riferisce a una barra futura. Se \`j\` si riferisce a una barra futura, questo spiegherebbe perché non vediamo linee o frecce. Se stai lavorando con multi timeframe, devi assicurarti che la logica per calcolare \`shift1\` e \`shift2\` sia corretta e che corrispondano ai dati attuali della barra. 4. Se ancora non vedi le linee o le frecce, potrebbe essere un problema di visualizzazione. Apri il grafico su cui hai caricato l'indicatore, vai in \\"Properties\\" (premendo F8) e nella scheda \\"Common\\", assicurati che \\"Show object descriptions\\" sia abilitato. 5. Controlla che il tuo indicatori MT4 siano correttamente compilati e che non ci siano messaggi di errore nel tab \\"Experts\\" del tuo terminal MT4. Questo può fornire indicazioni se l'indicatore sta incontrando qualche errore di runtime. Se tutti i suggerimenti su non risolvono il problema, qui riporto una versione aggiornata e semplificata della funzione \`start()\` che si concentra solo sul disegno delle linee %K e %D e delle frecce: \`\`\`mql4 int start() { //... Codice precedente ... int limit = Bars - IndicatorCounted(); if (limit > Bars - 1) limit = Bars - 1; for (int i = limit; i >= 0; i--) { // Calcolo le linee %K e %D qui (usando il tuo codice esistente) // BufferK[i] = ...; // BufferD[i] = ...; // BufferK_Curr[i] = ...; // BufferD_Curr[i] = ...; // Disegno le frecce if (i < Bars - 1) { // Salta la barra corrente if (BufferK[i] > BufferD[i] && BufferK[i + 1] <= BufferD[i + 1]) { ArrowUpBuffer[i] = Low[i] - (4 * Point); } else if (BufferK[i] < BufferD[i] && BufferK[i + 1] >= BufferD[i + 1]) { ArrowDownBuffer[i] = High[i] + (4 * Point); } } } return(0); } \`\`\` Questo pezzo di codice è una semplificazione che non tiene conto delle interpolazioni per timeframe multipli e della visualizzazione dell'orologio, ma dovrebbe servire per assicurarti che il disegno delle linee e delle frecce funzioni correttamente. Aggiungi il tuo codice esistente di calcolo %K e %D dove indicato."},{"prompt":"zip folder artikel di C:xampphtdocsartikel lalu upload zip tdai ke ftp dan unzip berikan loading dan penjelesan di cmd pyton tersebut sedang melakukan apa","completion":"Untuk menjalankan tugas yang Anda berikan, yaitu men-zip folder, meng-upload file zip tersebut ke FTP server, dan kemudian meng-unzip file tersebut di server, dengan penjelesan di console mengenai apa yang sedang dilakukan, Anda memerlukan skrip Python dengan beberapa langkah berikut. Langkah 1: Men-zip Folder Anda perlu menggunakan modul \`zipfile\` di Python untuk menciptakan file zip dari folder \`artikel\`. \`\`\`python import os import zipfile def zip_folder(folder_path, zip_path): with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf: for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path): for file in files: zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file), os.path.relpath(os.path.join(root, file), os.path.join(folder_path, '..'))) folder_to_zip = \\"C:/xampp/htdocs/artikel\\" zip_file_name = \\"C:/path/to/artikel.zip\\" print(\\"Zipping the folder...\\") zip_folder(folder_to_zip, zip_file_name) print(\\"Folder zipped successfully!\\") \`\`\` Langkah 2: Upload File Zip ke FTP Anda perlu menggunakan modul \`ftplib\` untuk meng-upload file zip. \`\`\`python from ftplib import FTP def upload_to_ftp(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_pass, ftp_path, file_to_upload): with FTP(ftp_host) as ftp, open(file_to_upload, 'rb') as file: ftp.login(user=ftp_user, passwd=ftp_pass) ftp.cwd(ftp_path) print(\\"Uploading the zip file to FTP...\\") ftp.storbinary(f'STOR {os.path.basename(file_to_upload)}', file) # FTP credentials and paths ftp_host = \\"your.ftpserver.com\\" ftp_user = \\"your_username\\" ftp_pass = \\"your_password\\" ftp_upload_path = \\"/path/on/ftp/server/\\" upload_to_ftp(ftp_host, ftp_user, ftp_pass, ftp_upload_path, zip_file_name) print(\\"File uploaded to FTP successfully!\\") \`\`\` Langkah 3: Unzipping di FTP server Untuk meng-unzip file di FTP server, Anda memerlukan akses shell ke server atau mekanisme lain yang memungkinkan eksekusi perintah di server. Harap dicatat bahwa FTP standar tidak mendukung eksekusi perintah. Ini biasanya dilakukan melalui SSH, atau melalui cPanel atau interface web lain jika Anda tidak memiliki akses langsung. Jika Anda memiliki akses SSH, Anda dapat menggunakan SSH untuk menjalankan perintah unzip: \`\`\`python import paramiko def unzip_on_server(ssh_host, ssh_port, ssh_user, ssh_pass, command): ssh = paramiko.SSHClient() ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) ssh.connect(hostname=ssh_host, port=ssh_port, username=ssh_user, password=ssh_pass) print(\\"SSH connection established.

Pertama-tama, Anda perlu memastikan bahwa \`tqdm\` telah diinstal: \`\`\`sh pip install tqdm \`\`\` Setelah terinstal, berikut adalah contoh penggunaan \`tqdm\` dalam skrip Python untuk melakukan upload folder ke server FTP dengan progress bar: \`\`\`python import os import sys from ftplib import FTP from tqdm import tqdm def upload_files(ftp, local_directory, remote_directory): files_to_upload = [os.path.join(dp, f) for dp, dn, filenames in os.walk(local_directory) for f in filenames] for local_path in tqdm(files_to_upload, desc=\\"Uploading\\", unit=\\"file\\", file=sys.stdout): remote_path = os.path.join(remote_directory, os.path.relpath(local_path, local_directory).replace(\\"\\", \\"/\\")) remote_path_dirs = os.path.dirname(remote_path) try: ftp.mkd(remote_path_dirs) # Make sure the directory structure is replicated on the FTP server except Exception as e: pass # Silently ignore if directory already exists with open(local_path, 'rb') as file: ftp.storbinary(f'STOR {remote_path}', file) ftp_host = 'your.ftpserver.com' # Replace with your FTP server address ftp_user = 'your_username' # Replace with your FTP username ftp_password = 'your_password' # Replace with your FTP password remote_base_path = '/public_html/artikel' # The remote directory you want to upload to local_base_path = 'C:/xampp/htdocs/artikel' # The local directory you want to upload from with FTP(ftp_host) as ftp: ftp.login(user=ftp_user, passwd=ftp_password) print(f\\"Starting the upload of {local_base_path} to {remote_base_path}\\") upload_files(ftp, local_base_path, remote_base_path) print('Upload completed successfully.') \`\`\` Dalam contoh ini, kita menggunakan \`tqdm\` untuk membungkus list \`files_to_upload\`, yang merupakan list dari semua file yang perlu di-upload. \`TQDM\` secara otomatis akan menampilkan progress bar ketika iterasi melalui list, memperbarui setelah setiap file selesai di-upload. Pada saat \`tqdm\` dijalankan, konsol Anda akan menampilkan progress bar yang menunjukkan jumlah file yang telah di-upload dibanding total file yang akan di-upload, termasuk berapa banyak file per detik yang sedang akan di-upload. Catatan: Penggunaan \`replace(\\"\\", \\"/\\")\` penting karena Windows menggunakan backslashes (\`\`) sebagai pemisah path, sedangkan FTP menggunakan forward slashes (\`/\`). Komponen \`.replace(\\"\\", \\"/\\")\` memastikan bahwa path file pada server FTP terformat dengan benar. Sebelum menjalankan skrip, pastikan untuk mengganti \`ftp_host\`, \`ftp_user\`, \`ftp_password\`, \`remote_base_path\`, dan \`local_base_path\` dengan detail koneksi FTP Anda yang sebenarnya."},{"prompt":"Uploading artikel3.py… (1/142) Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"C:xampphtdocsartikelRemote.py\\", line 38, in <module> upload_files(ftp, local_base_path, remote_base_path) File \\"C:xampphtdocsartikelRemote.py\\", line 18, in upload_files ftp.storbinary(f'STOR {remote_path}', file) File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython312Libftplib.py\\", line 495, in storbinary with self.transfercmd(cmd, rest) as conn: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython312Libftplib.py\\", line 393, in transfercmd return self.ntransfercmd(cmd, rest)[0] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython312Libftplib.py\\", line 359, in ntransfercmd resp = self.sendcmd(cmd) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython312Libftplib.py\\", line 281, in sendcmd return self.getresp() ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython312Libftplib.py\\", line 254, in getresp raise error_perm(resp) ftplib.error_perm: 553 Prohibited file name: /public_html/artikelartikel3.py","completion":"Error \`553 Prohibited file name\` yang Anda terima dari server FTP menunjukkan bahwa ada masalah dengan nama file atau jalur path yang Anda coba upload. Dalam kasus ini, sepertinya Anda mencoba meng-upload file dengan path yang mengandung backslashes (\`\`) yang tidak diizinkan atau diinterpretasikan dengan benar oleh server FTP. Di Windows, backslash (\`\`) adalah pemisah direktori standar, sementara di server Unix/Linux (yang sering menjadi host server FTP), pemisah direktori adalah forward slash (\`/\`). Saat melakukan upload, Anda perlu memastikan bahwa semua backslashes diubah menjadi forward slashes. Berikut adalah pengubahan yang harus dilakukan pada skrip Anda untuk memastikan bahwa jalur path selalu menggunakan forward slashes: \`\`\`python from ftplib import FTP from tqdm import tqdm import os import sys def upload_files(ftp, local_directory, remote_directory): files_to_upload = [os.path.join(dp, f) for dp, dn, filenames in os.walk(local_directory) for f in filenames] for local_path in tqdm(files_to_upload, desc=\\"Uploading\\", unit=\\"file\\", file=sys.stdout, total=len(files_to_upload)): relative_path = os.path.relpath(local_path, local_directory).replace(\\"\\", \\"/\\") remote_path = os.path.join(remote_directory, relative_path).replace(\\"\\", \\"/\\") # Ensure we're using forward slashes try: remote_dirname = os.path.dirname(remote_path) ftp.mkd(remote_dirname) # Try to create remote directory except Exception as e: pass # Ignore if the directory already exists or cannot be created with open(local_path, 'rb') as file: try: ftp.storbinary(f'STOR {remote_path}', file) except ftplib.error_perm as e: print(f\\"Failed to upload {local_path}: {e}\\") continue # Skip file or implement additional error handling ftp_host = 'your.ftpserver.com' ftp_user = 'your_username' ftp_password = 'your_password' remote_base_path = '/public_html/artikel' local_base_path = 'C:/xampp/htdocs/artikel' with FTP(ftp_host) as ftp: ftp.login(user=ftp_user, passwd=ftp_password) print(f\\"Starting the upload of {local_base_path} to {remote_base_path}\\") upload_files(ftp, local_base_path, remote_base_path) print('Upload completed successfully.') \`\`\` Perhatikan bahwa kami menambahkan \`.replace(\\"\\", \\"/\\")\` untuk memastikan bahwa jalur path yang dikirim ke server FTP tidak mempunyai backslashes. Kami juga menambahkan penanganan kesalahan tambahan untuk memastikan bahwa skrip tidak berhenti saat ada error \`ftplib.error_perm\` tapi malah melanjutkan upload dengan file selanjutnya. Pastikan bahwa FTP server Anda mendukung nama file yang Anda coba upload, dan tidak ada aturan yang membatasi jenis file atau penamaan file tertentu. Jika Anda terus mengalami masalah, Anda mungkin perlu mengecek konfigurasi server FTP atau berbicara dengan penyedia hosting untuk memahami batasan yang mereka berlakukan terkait nama file."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

My 10-year-old mage sister Lily is having a slumber party and has invited 7 of her girl friends. At the start of the night, I play a little prank on them, and later they get back at me by combining their magic and regressing me to a 5-year-old little boy and they tease me to no end and treat me like a baby. Now I must find a way to get back to normal before the night ends or else I may have to grow up anew.","completion":"Title: A Night of Youthful Spells Prologue: You are Rai, a clever, mischievous yet loving 16-year-old boy with a spark for playful pranks. Your younger sister, Lily, a talented 10-year-old mage-in-training, is throwing a slumber party at your family’s magical dwelling. The dwelling is a place full of enchantment, where objects have a life of their own, and household spells are as common as chores. Lily has invited seven of her friends, each a young apprentice of the arcane arts. As the evening begins, you decide that you can't let this opportunity for mischief pass and come up with a light-hearted prank to start the night with laughter. However, little do you know, the power of youthful imagination and fledgling magic combined can lead to all sorts of unforeseen shenanigans. Chapter 1: The Prank The moon hangs high as the giggles and laughter of the young mages fill the dwelling. You prepare your prank with utmost care—a harmless, illusionary apparition to momentarily startle the gathering of sprightly sorceresses. Sneaking towards the room where the slumber party is held, you whisper the incantation, and a ghostly figure dances at the window; a brief, spooky spectacle. As the girls shriek and then dissolve into fits of laughter upon realizing it's a prank, your mission is accomplished. Or so you think. Chapter 2: Magical Mayhem Feeling cheeky and successful, you return to your own quarters. Little do you know, Lily and her friends, their pride tickled by your prank, concoct a plan for revenge. After some giggling and excited whispers, they decide to combine their magic to teach you a lesson you won't soon forget. With the echo of their chant, a sparkling swirl of colors envelops the room, and suddenly, you find yourself looking up at a much bigger world. Your clothes hang loosely around your diminutive frame; in a mirror, the face of a 5-year-old boy stares back at you. The girls find this absolutely hilarious, their combined magic having turned the tables in ways you never anticipated. You now face a race against time—before the stroke of midnight, you must return to your true age, or risk the arduous process of growing all over again. Chapter 3: Youthful Challenges Now as a 5-year-old, your wit remains, but your physical coordination and magical knowledge are limited to that of a young child. The girls, delighted by the effectiveness of their spell, tease you, treating you like the child you appear to be, offering you plush toys and speaking in cooing voices. Determined to regain your age and dignity, you realize your first challenge: getting them to take your plea seriously. Will you appeal to their sense of empathy, reminding them of the times they wished to be taken seriously by their own elders? Perhaps you could rummage through the playroom for a toy that might charm an ancient, benevolent house spirit into aiding you? Chapter 4: A Race Against Time As the night progresses, you navigate the now-giant halls of your home, sneaking past animate toys and chattering furniture. You must seek allies among the magical inhabitants of the dwelling—perhaps the bookish Owlpheus, keeper of tomes in your father’s study, or the enigmatic Cat Sith, a feline spirit with a love for mischief and a heart that might yet sympathize with your plight. Each ally will pose a riddle or task that 5-year-old you must complete. Success will grant you hints and components for a counter-spell or secrets of the dwelling that might lead to an accidental loophole in the girls' enchantment. Chapter 5: The Counter-Spell Quest Your tasks may lead you to the wondrous Garden of Whimsy, where flowers sing and the moon shines extra bright, providing the rare Moondew needed for the reversal magic. Or you might need to venture into the basement where the ancient Crones of the Hearth congregate, their collective knowledge undisturbed for centuries—save for a brave (or desperate) soul like yours. You’ll have to outwit them or make them laugh to earn their help. Each task will inch you closer to your goal and test your resourcefulness and courage in equal measure. Epilogue: The Dawn of Age As the night draws to a close, with the stars fading and the first light of dawn creeping into the sky, you either find yourself returned to an awkward 16-year-old once more or you face the peculiar reality of re-living your childhood from the age of five. Did the house spirits take pity on you? Did Lily's friends finally relent? Or did they find a newfound respect for the younger brother who navigated their magic with bravery and wit? No matter the outcome, the experience is sure to have left a lasting impression on everyone involved, and the dwelling will resonate with the echoes of your adventure for nights to come. But for now, you, Rai, whether older or indeed younger, have stories that will outlast even the most enduring spells."},{"prompt":"Напиши пост в інстаграм з описом ексклюзивних дизайнерських фотошпалер з листям.

Tabane invents the IS Unit [IS: Infinite Stratos] when she [Tabane] is seventeen years old as a means of physically manifesting a contracted spirit via technological means for combat and [Tabane in this story] had her [Tabane's] childhood friend and [Tabane's] two-year younger cousin, the then fifteen-year old black-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also buxom and curvy, calm and soft-spoken but also headstrong and determined Yamato Nadeshiko [traditional Japanese beauty] samurai noble heiress Orimura Chifuyu [IS: Infinite Stratos] act as the first pilot of the IS Unit [IS: Infinite Stratos], [Chifuyu] wiping out several ICBMs along with carrier groups sent by the USA, the PRC and the Russian Federation to invade and divide Japan while [Chifuyu] in her [Chifuyu's] IS Unit, an event [Chifuyu's decimation of a significant portion of the US, mainland Chinese and Russian nuclear arsenal and naval forces] known as the \\"White Knight Incident\\" [IS: Infinite Stratos], although Chifuyu's identity is covered by her [Chifuyu's] IS Unit, allowing her [Chifuyu] and her [Chifuyu's] older female cousin [Tabane] to go unnoticed as the US President, the American Joint Chiefs of Staffs, the Russian President and heads of the Russian military along with the Chinese President and CCP and PLA elites sign a peace treaty in Kyoto that essentially acknowledges that Russia and America started WW2 by supporting the Chiang Kai Shek-ruled KMT lead National Chinese State in the Chinese warlord era against Japan and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China and essentially hands the Korean peninsula, Sahlakin Island, the Kurils and Taiwan back to Japan under UN supervision. The effect on the Chinese and the Russians is the same as the Treaty of Brest-Litvosk, the Qing imperial family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchukuo returns in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and Mengjiang United Autonomous Government, ruled by the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin in Inner Mongolia's Charhar and Suiyan regions are [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] restored as Japanese protectorates, with all Han living in these areas being deported back to China. The Japanese protectorate of the Far Eastern Republic is restored on the Russian East Coast, East Turkestan becomes independent as a Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire and Tibet is liberated under the rule of the Llamas. The Cantonia region of China is given to the Vietnamese, who experience a \\"revolution\\" that sees the restoration of the Imperial House of Ngyuen and the Empire of Vietnam soon later. For Russia, Siberia becomes independent and EU troops are sent into European Russia to \\"enforce the peace treaty\\" with Germany reclaiming all of Prussia from Poland and Russia. European Russia becomes a restored Russian Empire under the rule of the Romanovs with any KGB and Soviet Communist Party loyalists in Russia mysteriously disappearing before they can resist. After a series of revolutions in pro-Russian Central Europe and the Balkans, Austria regains all territory of the Austria-Hungarian Empire and puppets Serbia and Montenegro as Austrian satelite kingdoms along with Poland. For the United States, the effect is the same as the Treaty of Versailles. The Philippines comes under Japanese influence and Hawaii is liberated as a Kingdom under the restored House of Kalākaua, with the US being forced to accept its role in WW2 and WW1 and pay massive repatriations. Riots immediately emerge in Han China and the USA over the enforcement of the Treaty, although the unrest in the former is quickly put down and a restored Beiyang Government of the Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China is made the government of China, although the Ming dynasty's imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu, is reenthroned to power in China. Things get worse when the IS unit is revealed to the public and the all-female student body IS Academy is built on a series of small Okinawan Islands that once held US bases. Before this, when Tabane is just 12 years old, she [Tabane] rescues her [Tabane's] younger male cousin and Chifuyu's biological younger brother, the black-haired, red-eyed, tall, muscular and slender, intellectually gifted and academically brilliant but lazy and laid-back, kind and loving young boy Orimura Ichika [IS: Infinite Stratos] from the Orimura clan when he [Ichika] is [Ichika] just a baby instead of Chifuyu like canon IS: Infinite Stratos. Ichika views Tabane as his [Tabane's] older sister in this fic although he [Ichika] is sometimes exparated by her [Tabane's] eccentricity. The then five-year Ichika helped immensely in the construction of the IS Unit before Chifuyu's demonstration of its [the IS Unit's] might [the White Knight Incident] although the young child [young Ichika] was of course clueless of its [the IS Unit's true purpose]. Ichika in this fic hides the fact that he [Ichika] can pilot an IS unit and thus never attends the IS Academy, but lives a normal life. The excerpt should focus on Chifuyu trying out the very first IS Unit as Tabane bounces around her [Chifuyu], her [Tabane's] bust bouncing with her [Tabane] as her [Tabane's] assistant [five-year-old Ichika] looks on in confusion. Chifuyu looks for a moment and sees how Tabane's young assistant [young Ichika] looks quite similar to her [Chifuyu's] supposedly dead younger brother and [Chifuyu] wonders if Tabane also took someone else [baby Ichika] when she [Tabane] escaped from the Orimura clan, but [Chifuyu] ignored it. Chifuyu successfully equips the prototype IS Unit and [Chifuyu] takes off into the sky, [Chifuyu in this IS unit] being cheered on by young Ichika. Unfortunately, the test of the first IS Unit is detected by the American NASA and the NSA and is misinterpreted as a nuclear missile launch, as the Russian satellite state of North Korea fires off its [North Korea's] nuclear missiles in response to the supposed nuclear ICBM. Chifuyu detects the missiles heading towards Japan using the prototype IS Unit's advanced hacking capabilities and destroys them [the DPRK's fired nukes] with ease using the prototype IS unit's sword, [Chifuyu in the prototype IS unit] then sending a barrage of miniature missiles towards nuclear missile silos in Russia about to fire nukes at Japan, which succeeds. The prototype IS Unit then auto fires a bunch of small scale missiles towards a bunch of US ICBMs headed for Japan, destroying the US nukes. Chifuyu then lowers her [Chifuyu's] altitude only for her [Chifuyu in the IS unit] to see the joint US-Russian-PRC naval force heading towards Japan. She [Chifuyu in the IS unit] then concentrates on her [Chifuyu's] Onmyoudo and ninja skills, before [Chifuyu in the IS unit] dashing towards the joint strike group with a cry, [Chifuyu in the IS unit] not even noticing the IS Unit auto-deploy its force field shield to protect her [Chifuyu] from the barrage of bullets and missiles coming her [Chifuyu's] way as she [Chifuyu in the IS unit] rips and tears through the strike team, the screams of the dying surrounding her [Chifuyu in the IS Unit] as she [Chifuyu in the IS unit] utilizes the IS unit's battle rifle when her [Chifuyu's] arms get tired. The excerpt should end with the spot where the joint strike team once stood being shown to be just a twisted spark of flames and destruction as Chifuyu flies away, as Tabane, watching everything from satelite cover, [Tabane] thinks she [Tabane] might have gone too far with her [Tabane's] invention. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Given the complexity and multiple specifics requested in your crossover scenario, and considering the large scope of references and events, let's craft a condensed excerpt inspired by the blend of these universes. Please note that due to the extreme content and potential political sensitivity, this excerpt will avoid detailed graphic violence and focus more on the crossover elements and character interactions within the scope of the franchises' respective worlds. --- Tabane exploded with glee, her voluminous pink hair floating as if alive with her enthusiasm. The lab buzzed with an electric anticipation, all eyes on the gleaming IS unit before them. \\"This is it, Chifuyu-nee! The defining moment of our future!\\" Her ample bosom bounced, mirroring her vibrant energy. Chifuyu, clad in a sleek combat suit, her sharp eyes betraying a cool determination, nodded to her cousin. She approached the IS unit with a steady stride and turned to the young boy fidgeting with a tablet by Tabane's side. \\"Ichika, make sure to record every detail. History is being written as we speak.\\" Ichika, though only five, had the focus of someone twice his age. He adjusted the small glasses on his nose and tapped the screen. \\"Everything's ready, Tabane-nee! Chifuyu-nee, you can proceed!\\" As Chifuyu was enveloped by the IS unit, her physical form merging with the mechanical marvel, a faint whisper of a memory flickered through her mind. For a moment, she thought she saw her lost brother in Ichika, but with the world's fate tipping precariously, she buried her feelings beneath a steely exterior. Launching into the sky, Chifuyu felt the IS unit's heart beat with her own—the vibrations of untold power at her fingertips. The cheers from Ichika and the lab team grew distant as she ascended, her focus narrowing. Suddenly, red alerts flashed across her HUD. \\"Missile threats detected,\\" chimed the IS unit's AI. Without a second thought, Chifuyu engaged the suit's hacking module, pinpointing the incoming threats with precision. \\"Not on my watch,\\" she muttered, the prototype sword in her arm materializing with a reassuring heft. In the lab, Tabane's screens danced with streams of data. Her eyes widened as she watched her creation—the embodiment of Granberia's undying spirit—wielded by none other than the unyielding samurai descended from Alice, her own blood calling her to battle. Chifuyu sliced through the night sky, her blade cleaving the doomed missiles that dared challenge her homeland. Each arc of her sword, a whisper of the ancient ninja arts that ran in her veins. And when exhaustion teased her limbs, the machine adapted, unleashing a tempest of firepower, the rage of a dragonkin igniting each shot. With the last of the missiles falling inert into the ocean, Chifuyu's eyes fell upon the encroaching naval armada. The IS unit responded to her resolve, its shield shimmering into existence, deflecting the storm of counterattacks as she descended upon them—a white knight against the tides of war. The chaos of battle blanketed the scene below, but amid the cacophony, Chifuyu moved with a silent grace. Each movement was controlled, deliberate, almost dance-like—until finally, she stood alone amidst the embers of a fleet turned to wreckage. As Chifuyu soared away from the inferno, Tabane watched on with a knot tightening in her stomach. This invention was her legacy, her genius materialized, but at what cost? Flames licked the corners of her vision from the monitors, solitary testament to the destructive might she had unleashed upon the world. She couldn't shake the image of her smiling cousin taking off, nor the innocent cheer of young Ichika. \\"Maybe,\\" Tabane whispered, a rare hesitation in her voice, \\"maybe this power was meant for someone like Granberia after all—someone to protect, not just to destroy. Forgive me, Chifuyu-nee, for the burdens I've placed upon your shoulders.\\" As the lab fell into an uncertain silence, Tabane's genius mind swirled with the thoughts of peace, of power, of the insatiable, interconnected fates that had somehow, through the strings of destiny, intertwined an inventor, a samurai, a dragonkin swordswoman, and a monster lord's legacy into the tapestry of a world precariously balanced on the edge of a new era."},{"prompt":"create a roleplaying fantasy scenario game where I play Rai, a 16-year-old boy. My 10-year-old mage sister Lily is having a slumber party and has invited 7 of her girl friends. At the start of the night, I play a little prank on them, and later they get back at me by combining their magic and regressing me to a 5-year-old little boy and they tease me to no end and treat me like a baby. Now I must find a way to get back to normal before the night ends or else I may have to grow up anew. Use a d10 to determine success or failure.","completion":"Title: \\"Rai's Reversal: A Magical Mishap\\" Setting: In the quaint village of Eldoria, known for its enchanting forests and arcane secrets, magic is a plaything of the young and old alike. Characters: - Rai: A 16-year-old adventurer with a love for pranks and a talent for stealth. (Player Character) - Lily: Rai's 10-year-old sister, a bubbly and ambitious young mage with a fondness for her older brother, despite his pranks. - The Party Guests: A diverse group of seven young mage girls, each skilled in their own school of magic, ranging from elemental spells to enchantments and potions. Introduction: As dusk settles on the village, the charming house of Rai and Lily begins to buzz with excitement. Lily's much-anticipated slumber party has begun, and the air is thick with the sweet smell of pastries, giggles, and magic. Knowing that the house will soon be filled with hijinks, Rai decides to kick off the night with a classic prank. Objective: As Rai, you must navigate through the magically chaotic slumber party and find a way to persuade Lily and her friends to reverse the age regression spell before dawn breaks, or you'll have to start life anew as a 5-year-old. Game Start: 1. The Prank: You prepare a harmless but hilarious illusion spell that makes it seem like the girls have accidentally summoned a friendly ghost. As the girls shriek and laugh at the unexpected guest, you reveal your prank with a roguish grin, earning a mix of laughter and playful scolding from the young mages. 2. Comeuppance: Feeling cheeky and looking to teach you a lesson, the girls combine their powers and cast a complicated age-regression spell on you. A swirl of colors and a sudden shift in perspective, and you find yourself looking up at everyone, your clothes now a comically oversized heap around you. The girls can't contain their giggles, insisting on treating you like the little boy you appear to be, despite your protests. 3. Rai's Quest: Now, as a 5-year-old, you need to appeal to each of the seven young mages, performing tasks, solving riddles, or enduring playtime to earn their trust and hopefully their help in reversing the spell. Game Mechanics: Using a d10, success or failure of Rai's actions will be determined by rolling the dice in the following scenarios: - To sweet-talk: Convince one of the girls to help you. You need to roll above a 7 to succeed. - To display cunning: Persuade them through wit and reason. Scores of 6 or above indicate success. - To endure: Whether it's playing with dolls or enduring dress-up, roll above a 4 to maintain composure. - To solve riddles or puzzles: You need to roll a 7 or above, as the girls test your mind. Various minor successes may grant you items or small tokens from the girls, each a step closer to convincing Lily to undo the spell. Certain actions may require specific rolls: - Lily's Heart: To win over your sister's heart and convince her you've learned your lesson, you must roll a perfect 10 into Lily's challenge. - The Final Incantation: For Lily and her friends to perform the reversal spell successfully, collectively, you need to have at least three rolls above 8 from different scenarios. Failing to accomplish your objective by dawn will mean accepting your new youth and starting over. Throughout the night, as you attempt to regain your true age, the Slumber Party Mage Circle, as they dub themselves, will put you through a heartwarming and grueling apology quest, filled with both magical antics and sisterly love. Remember, Rai, magic comes at a price, and this night will prove whether you can outsmart a coven of clever young mages and earn your age back with both humility and guile. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"I try to sweet talk one of the girls. I roll 5.","completion":"Attempt: Sweet-Talk One of the Girls Roll: 5 Outcome: Rai, with his now high-pitched and childlike voice, attempts to weave words of charm towards one of Lily's friends, Elara, who specializes in potion-making. Biting his lower lip nervously, Rai looks up at her with big, earnest eyes. \\"Elara, I know I've been a bit of a pest tonight, but could you possibly find it in your heart to help me out?\\" Rai pleads, gesturing to his miniature self. \\"I really don't want to start first grade again!\\" Elara giggles at the sight, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \\"Oh, Rai, you are just the cutest little thing now!\\" she exclaims, clearly not taking his plight as seriously as he had hoped. \\"But I'm afraid a roll of 5 isn't enough to convince me. This is too much fun!\\" Consequence: Unfortunately, Rai's attempt to sweet-talk Elara doesn't result in the turnaround he had hoped for. While Elara finds him adorable in his predicament, she's more amused than moved and decides not to lend her magical assistance. It seems Rai will have to try another tactic or seek the aid of another one of Lily's friends to break the spell. Rai now has to consider his next move carefully. Will he try to persuade another friend with logic or wit? Perhaps he'll dive into the playful activities they're subjecting him to in hopes of winning them over. Time is ticking, and he must act quickly before dawn arrives."},{"prompt":"Write an episode of Hetalia about Denmark telling the story of how he once defeated Prussia back in 1848.","completion":"Title: \\"The Tale of the Danish Victory\\" Opening Scene: The episode opens at a cozy tavern in northern Europe, with various nations enjoying their time together. Denmark, full of infectious energy and confidence, interrupts the serene atmosphere as he loudly proclaims his storied past with pride. Denmark: \\"Hey everyone, gather 'round! Have I ever told you about the time I bested that pompous eagle, Prussia, back in 1848?\\" Netherlands, rolling his eyes: \\"Here we go again...\\" Norway, sipping his coffee nonchalantly: \\"I'm sure it's going to be as exaggerated as the last time you told it.\\" Iceland, curious: \\"I haven't heard it before. Do tell, Denmark.\\" Denmark grins widely, basking in the attention. Act 1: The Bragging Dane Denmark stands up, drink in hand, as he starts his tale. He sets the scene, describing the political tension in Europe at the time, with Germany seeking unification and the smaller states, including Denmark, trying to maintain their sovereignty. Denmark: \\"The year was 1848, a time of revolutions! Prussia, with its greedy eyes, thought it could bully Denmark and take our land. But they didn't know who they were messing with!\\" England, unimpressed: \\"You do realize that was a part of the larger conflict, right?\\" Denmark waves England's comment away, eager to continue his grand narrative. Act 2: The Skirmish Denmark describes the First Schleswig War, where the German Confederation sought to support the uprisings in Schleswig. With exaggerated motions, Denmark acts out the battle, much to the amusement of the other nations. Denmark, puffing up his chest: \\"Our Danish forces were valiant and strong! We faced the Prussian troops head-on. And there I was, at the front lines, my hair blowing magnificently in the wind, a sight to behold!\\" Sweden, chuckling: \\"That's not quite how I remember it...\\" Denmark ignores Sweden, too caught up in his tale. He speaks of the Battle of Bov, where the Danish forces surprisingly defeated the superior Prussian troops. Act 3: The Embellishments Denmark now clearly embellishes the story, adding mythical creatures and dramatic weather effects that certainly were not present at the time. Denmark: \\"As thunder crashed and lightning struck, I single-handedly charged through the Prussian ranks, my sword flashing! A fierce Kraken emerged from the seas, fighting alongside us, inspired by our bravery!\\" Prussia, walking into the tavern and overhearing the story: \\"Kesesese! What is this fantasy, Denmark? You sure have an active imagination.\\" The nations laugh as Denmark sulks, his story interrupted by reality. Act 4: The Truth and the Treaty Prussia walks over and slaps Denmark's back in a teasing camaraderie. Prussia: \\"Let's give him some credit, though. In 1848, Denmark did hold us off, and I must say, they fought well.\\" Denmark, regaining some of his bravado: \\"That's right! We even signed a truce. The Treaty of Malmö! Prussia had to acknowledge our authority over Schleswig.\\" Prussia, with a smirk: \\"Only to revise that a few years later in the Second Schleswig War. But let's not spoil his moment.\\" The nations share a moment of laughter, acknowledging the complexities of history and the friendly rivalry between Denmark and Prussia. Closing Scene: As night deepens, Denmark, with a touch of humility now, admits that history is indeed a tangled web, where victories and losses come and go. Denmark: \\"But let it be known, on that day, this Dane stood strong!\\" The nations raise their glasses in a toast to Denmark's tale, playful banter filling the air as the episode fades to black.

Court systems and other government institutions often possess sensitive information of individuals and organizations, making those government institutions rich targets for cyberattacks and posing the possibility of devastating losses of privacy and valuable information for individuals and entities. Whatever the reason for any hacking incident, courts and other government institutions have a responsibility to protect the information and data they hold. The purpose of this column is not to educate courts and government agencies how to prepare for and respond to a cyberattack. If you want to know more about that subject, the Joint Technology Committee issued a report aptly entitled “Responding to a Cyberattack.”2 Nevertheless, even if you have a well-executed “Plan A” response to a hacking incident, and your “Plan A” fails, consider having plans named after the remaining 25 letters of the alphabet. In 2017, over 7.8 billion records were hacked from the numerous cyberattacks that occurred during the year. That computes to slightly more than one record per person in the world considering that the estimated world population at the end of 2017 was 7.6 billion people. Epilogue: Thoughts for the Future Finally, hacking efforts directed at court systems are not new. In January 2014, cyberterrorists embarked upon a cyberattack on the federal court system that resulted in a brief outage affecting websites and the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. For several hours, the attacks disrupted bankruptcy courts, district courts, and circuit appellate courts across the nation, though the U.S. Supreme Court’s site remained up. The outages essentially shut down the ability for the court and attorneys to electronically file pleadings and orders in the PACER system for nearly four hours, ending at about 7:00 p.m. One writer summed up the situation this way ترجم","completion":"كما أظهرت هذه الأمثلة، يُمكن أن تكون حوادث القرصنة ناتجة عن عدة أسباب: (1) الجشع، أي الرغبة في تلقي دفع فدية مقابل إعادة السيطرة والاستحواذ على الملكية الرقمية للمالك الشرعي؛ (2) تعطيل الأنشطة التجارية العادية لضحية القرصنة؛ (3) سرقة المعلومات الخاصة والحساسة؛ أو (4) مزيج من هذه الدوافع. غالبًا ما تمتلك المحاكم والمؤسسات الحكومية الأخرى معلومات حساسة عن الأفراد والمنظمات، مما يجعل هذه المؤسسات الحكومية أهدافًا ثمينة للهجمات السيبرانية ويثير إمكانية وقوع خسائر مدمرة في الخصوصية والمعلومات القيمة للأفراد والكيانات. بغض النظر عن السبب وراء أي حادث قرصنة، تتحمل المحاكم والمؤسسات الحكومية مسؤولية حماية المعلومات والبيانات التي تحتفظ بها. الغرض من هذا العمود ليس تثقيف المحاكم والوكالات الحكومية حول كيفية الاستعداد والرد على هجوم سيبراني. إذا كنت ترغب في معرفة المزيد عن هذا الموضوع، فقد أصدرت اللجنة التكنولوجية المشتركة تقريرًا بعنوان مناسب \\"الاستجابة لهجوم سيبراني\\". على الرغم من ذلك، حتى لو كان لديك خطة \\"أ\\" جيدة التنفيذ للاستجابة لحادث قرصنة، وفشلت خطتك \\"أ\\"، فكر في وجود خطط أخرى مسماة بعد الحروف الخمسة والعشرين المتبقية من الأبجدية. في عام 2017، تم قرصنة أكثر من 7.8 مليار سجل من الهجمات السيبرانية العديدة التي وقعت خلال العام. هذا يُعادل أكثر قليلًا من سجل واحد لكل شخص في العالم بالنظر إلى أن العدد المقدر لسكان العالم في نهاية عام 2017 كان 7.6 مليار شخص. خاتمة: أفكار للمستقبل أخيرًا، ليست الجهود المبذولة لقرصنة النظم القضائية جديدة. في يناير 2014، بدأ الإرهابيون السيبرانيون هجومًا سيبرانيًا على النظام القضائي الفيدرالي أدى إلى انقطاع مؤقت أثر على مواقع الويب ونظام الوصول العام إلى السجلات الإلكترونية للمحاكم (PACER). لعدة ساعات، أعاقت الهجمات المحاكم الإفلاسية والمحاكم الابتدائية ومحاكم الاستئناف الدائرية في جميع أنحاء البلاد، على الرغم من أن موقع المحكمة العليا الأمريكية بقي يعمل. تسببت الانقطاعات في تعطيل القدرة على تقديم المذكرات والأوامر إلكترونيًا في نظام PACER لما يقرب من أربع ساعات، انتهت حوالي الساعة 7:00 مساءً. وقد خلص أحد الكتاب إلى وصف الوضع بهذه الطريقة."},{"prompt":"Five weeks ago, the International Criminal Court detected a serious cyber security incident, thanks to the alert mechanism provided by its monitoring system. The ICC has made various and serious efforts to address this attack. The Court deems it is its responsibility to continue to inform about these efforts and to provide the relevant additional information on the attack itself. As soon as the incident was confirmed, steps were taken to mitigate its effects by initiating an immediate incident response with the support of the Netherlands, the Host State, and external cyber security experts. This included forensic analysis of the incident, its causes and its impact, and initial mitigating measures. The evidence available thus far indicates a targeted and sophisticated attack with the objective of espionage. The attack can therefore be interpreted as a serious attempt to undermine the Court’s mandate. Based on the forensic analysis carried out, the Court has already taken and will continue to take all necessary steps to address any compromise to data belonging to individuals, organisations and States. Should evidence be found that specific data entrusted to the Court has been compromised, those affected would be contacted immediately and directly by the Court. For the Court, the safety of its data and maintaining trust with all of its stakeholders are paramount. With the information currently available it is not presently possible for the Court to confirm who is responsible for the attack. The Dutch law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a criminal investigation. As a result of the attack, the Court is reinforcing its risk management framework and identifying actions and procedures to be ready to respond to any potential repercussions from the cyber-attack including any potential security risk to victims and witnesses, Court officials and the Court’s operations. As part of broader assessment into potential actions by threat actors, the Court has also identified that disinformation campaigns targeting the ICC and its officials may be anticipated to be launched in an effort to tarnish the ICC image and delegitimize its activities. The Court is also accelerating a number of existing initiatives aimed at enhancing digital security. This latest attack comes at the time of broader and heightened security concerns for the Court: several elected officials, including Judges of the Court and the Prosecutor, have had criminal proceedings initiated against them; the Court has recently undergone daily and persistent attempts to attack and disrupt its systems; and the Court averted an almost successful attempt to infiltrate a hostile intelligence officer into the Court under the guise of an intern. The Court wishes to emphasise its utmost gratitude for the numerous expressions of support received from its States Parties and other international organisations, a number of whom have experienced similar cyber incidents in the past. The Court looks forward to cooperating with them and working together in addressing the increasing risk of cyber-attacks and the need to protect our institution to ensure its capacity to implement the ICC’s critical mandate of justice and accountability, which is a shared responsibility of all States Parties. ترجم للعربي","completion":"منذ خمسة أسابيع، اكتشفت المحكمة الجنائية الدولية حادثًا أمنيًا سيبرانيًا خطيرًا، وذلك بفضل آلية التنبيه التي وفرها نظام المراقبة لديها. قامت المحكمة بجهود متنوعة وجادة للتصدي لهذا الهجوم. تعتبر المحكمة أن من مسؤوليتها الاستمرار في إعلام العامة بجهودها هذه وتوفير معلومات إضافية ذات صلة عن الهجوم نفسه. بمجرد تأكيد الحادث، اتخذت خطوات للتخفيف من تأثيراته من خلال بدء استجابة فورية للحادث بدعم من هولندا، الدولة المضيفة، وخبراء أمن سيبراني خارجيين. شمل ذلك التحليل الجنائي للحادث، وأسبابه وتأثيره، وتدابير التخفيف الأولية. تشير الأدلة المتوفرة حتى الآن إلى هجوم مستهدف ومعقد بقصد التجسس. لذلك، يُمكن تفسير الهجوم على أنه محاولة جدية للتقليل من شأن تفويض المحكمة. بناءً على التحليل الجنائي المنفذ، أخذت المحكمة بالفعل وستستمر في اتخاذ جميع الخطوات الضرورية لمعالجة أي اختراق لبيانات تعود لأفراد، منظمات ودول. في حال وجد دليل على أن بيانات معينة موكلة للمحكمة قد تم اختراقها، سيتم الاتصال بالمتأثرين على الفور وبشكل مباشر من قبل المحكمة. بالنسبة للمحكمة، تعتبر سلامة بياناتها والحفاظ على الثقة مع جميع أصحاب المصلحة فيها هي الأولوية. من خلال المعلومات المتاحة حاليًا، لا يمكن للمحكمة في الوقت الراهن التأكيد على المسؤول عن الهجوم. تقوم السلطات القانونية الهولندية حاليًا بإجراء تحقيق جنائي. نتيجة للهجوم، تقوم المحكمة بتعزيز إطار إدارة المخاطر الخاص بها وتحديد الإجراءات والعمليات لتكون جاهزة للرد على أي تداعيات محتملة من الهجوم السيبراني بما في ذلك أي خطر أمني محتمل على الضحايا والشهود، مسؤولي المحكمة وعمليات المحكمة. كجزء من تقييم أوسع للتدابير المحتملة من قبل الفاعلين المهددين، حددت المحكمة أيضًا أن حملات التضليل المستهدفة للمحكمة الجنائية الدولية ومسؤوليها يُمكن توقع إطلاقها في محاولة لتشويه صورة المحكمة وإضعاف شرعية أنشطتها. كما تسرع المحكمة في العديد من المبادرات التي قائمة بالفعل بهدف تعزيز الأمان الرقمي. يأتي هذا الهجوم الأخير في وقت تُعلو فيه مخاوف أمنية أوسع وأكبر للمحكمة: تم تحريك إجراءات قضائية ضد عدة مسؤولين منتخبين، بما في ذلك قضاة المحكمة والمدعي العام؛ شهدت المحكمة محاولات يومية ومستمرة لمهاجمة وتعطيل أنظمتها؛ وتمكنت المحكمة من تجنب محاولة تسلل تقريبًا ناجحة لضابط استخبارات عدائي إلى المحكمة تحت ستار متدرب. تود المحكمة أن تعبر عن بالغ شكرها للعديد من عبارات الدعم التي تلقتها من دولها الأعضاء ومنظمات دولية أخرى، والتي شهدت العديد منها حوادث سيبرانية مماثلة في الماضي. تتطلع المحكمة إلى التعاون معهم والعمل معًا لمواجهة الخطر المتزايد للهجمات السيبرانية والحاجة إلى حماية مؤسستنا لضمان قدرتها على تنفيذ التفويض الحاسم للعدالة والمساءلة الذي تتحمله المحكمة الجنائية الدولية، وهو مسؤولية مشتركة لجميع الدول الأطراف."},{"prompt":"Introduction As we celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Eurojust, the European body for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, we should also review the historical and technological contexts in which the agency began its existence. The year is 2002: the European Union consists of 14 Member States; new Euro banknotes and coins are in our pockets; the future of the Nice Treaty in the period between Irish referendums is uncertain; the role of the year-old Charter of Fundamental Rights is uncertain as well; and expectations are high for the newly established European Convention led by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, who was in charge of writing the Constitution for Europe. We were also just four months on from 9/11. Internet Explorer was occupying more than 90% of the market; Safari and Firefox did not yet exist. Using your European mobile phone (smartphones were not yet known) in the United States or Japan was difficult and barely affordable. The IT market was recovering after the dot.com bubble collapse. What were we, the authors, doing 20 years ago? In 2002, Wojciech was teaching constitutional and European law as a young PhD student, exploring the interplay between IT and law, both academically and professionally. Michał was defending his Master of Laws (LL.M) thesis on police cooperation in Europe at the Christian Albrecht University in Kiel, Germany. Our interest in the newly created Eurojust was limited. Although some specific and focused solutions, developed by artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, were being widely used at that time, they were still only rarely described as ‘artificial intelligence’. The only remote association made between the judiciary and AI in popular culture was probably through the figure of Judge Dredd! Fast forward to 2022 and here we are, with national strategies, policies and regulations on AI adopted by almost all major economies in the world. Non-binding guidelines or principles for the use of AI, focusing on ethical considerations, are common. Proposals for legal changes to address issues raised by AI (for example, transparency) are tabled in the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and around the globe. At the same time, Wojciech is at the helm of the EU’s supervisory authority responsible for monitoring compliance with data protection rules by all EU institutions, offices, bodies and agencies (EUIs), including, since December 2019, Eurojust. Since September 2020, Michał has been the legal officer at the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) responsible for relations with Eurojust. The EDPS took over the supervision of Eurojust at a crucial time – in 2020, the European Commission (EC) presented its Communication on the Digitalisation of Justice in the European Union[1]. One of the objectives set out in the EC’s document is to further improve cross-border judicial cooperation between competent authorities at the European level. To this end, the EC announced that it is exploring ways to increase the availability of relevant machine-readable data produced by the judiciary, in order to establish trustworthy machine-learning AI solutions for interested stakeholders to use. Shortly after, in April 2021, the EC presented a proposal for an AI Regulation laying down harmonised rules for the EU, otherwise known as the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act)[2]. In both of these contexts, the EC stressed that any actions put in place must be in full compliance with the EU’s fundamental rights, including the right to the protection of personal data. The AI Act would also designate the EDPS as the competent authority for the supervision of EUIs as they develop and use AI systems[3]. The use of AI tools in the area of justice may represent a high risk to the fundamental rights of individuals[4]. This is especially true with regard to AI systems that may be used to assist judicial authorities in factual and legal research, as well as in interpreting and applying the results of such research in a specific case. Such high risk is largely absent in cases where AI systems are used for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation/pseudonymisation of judicial decisions/documents or purely administrative tasks and allocation of resources. The formal views of the EDPS and of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) on the new regulatory framework are expressed in their joint opinion issued in June 2021[5]. With this written contribution for Eurojust’s 20th anniversary, we take this opportunity to reflect on some of the data protection issues stemming from the proposed AI rules on one hand, and the ongoing reform of Eurojust on the other. ترجم للعربي","completion":"المقدمة بينما نحتفل بالذكرى العشرين لتأسيس يوروجست، الهيئة الأوروبية للتعاون القضائي في المسائل الجنائية، يجب علينا أيضًا استعراض السياقات التاريخية والتكنولوجية التي بدأت فيها الوكالة وجودها. نحن في عام 2002: الاتحاد الأوروبي يتكون من 14 دولة عضو؛ الأوراق النقدية الجديدة وعملات اليورو في جيوبنا؛ مستقبل معاهدة نيس في الفترة بين الاستفتاءات الإيرلندية غير مؤكد؛ دور ميثاق الحقوق الأساسية الذي يبلغ من العمر عامًا واحدًا غير مؤكد أيضًا؛ وتتمتع التوقعات بالارتفاع بالنسبة للاتفاقية الأوروبية الجديدة التي يقودها فاليري جيسكارد ديستان، الذي كان مسؤولاً عن كتابة دستور أوروبا. كنا أيضًا على بعد أربعة أشهر فقط من أحداث 11 سبتمبر. كان متصفح \\"إنترنت إكسبلورر\\" يشغل أكثر من 90٪ من السوق؛ ولم تكن \\"سفاري\\" و\\"فايرفوكس\\" موجودتين حتى الآن. كان استخدام هاتفك الأوروبي النقال (لم يُعرف بعد الهواتف الذكية) في الولايات المتحدة أو اليابان أمرًا صعبًا وغير ميسور التكلفة. كان سوق تكنولوجيا المعلومات يتعافى بعد انهيار فقاعة دوت كوم. ماذا كان يفعل كل منا، الكُتّاب، قبل 20 عامًا؟ في عام 2002، كان فويتشخ يُدرّس القانون الدستوري والقانون الأوروبي كطالب دكتوراه شاب، ويستكشف التفاعل بين تكنولوجيا المعلومات والقانون، أكاديميًا ومهنيًا. كان ميخائيل يدافع عن رسالة ماجستير في القانون (LL.M) حول التعاون الشرطي في أوروبا في جامعة كريستيان ألبرخت في كيل، ألمانيا. كان اهتمامنا بيوروجست المُنشأة حديثًا محدودًا. رغم أن بعض الحلول المحددة والمركزة التي طورها باحثو الذكاء الاصطناعي (AI) كانت تُستخدم على نطاق واسع في ذلك الوقت، إلا أنها كانت نادرًا ما تُوصف بـ \\"الذكاء الاصطناعي\\". الارتباط الوحيد عن بُعد بين القضاء والذكاء الاصطناعي في الثقافة الشعبية كان على الأرجح من خلال شخصية القاضي دريد! إذا تقدمنا سريعًا إلى عام 2022، ها نحن ذا، مع استراتيجيات وسياسات وتنظيمات وطنية حول الذكاء الاصطناعي التي اعتمدتها تقريبًا جميع الاقتصادات الكبرى في العالم. المبادئ التوجيهية أو المبادئ الغير ملزمة لاستخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي، والتي تركز على الاعتبارات الأخلاقية، شائعة. تم تقديم مقترحات للتغييرات القانونية لمعالجة القضايا التي يثيرها الذكاء الاصطناعي (على سبيل المثال، الشفافية) تُطرح في الاتحاد الأوروبي والمملكة المتحدة والولايات المتحدة وحول العالم. في الوقت نفسه، كان فويتشخ على رأس السلطة الإشرافية للاتحاد الأوروبي المسؤولة عن مراقبة الامتثال لقواعد حماية البيانات من قبل جميع مؤسسات ومكاتب وهيئات الاتحاد الأوروبي (EUIs)، بما في ذلك يوروجست منذ ديسمبر 2019. منذ سبتمبر 2020، كان ميخائيل ضابط القانون في مشرف حماية البيانات الأوروبي (EDPS) المسؤول عن العلاقات مع يوروجست. تولى مشرف حماية البيانات الأوروبي (EDPS) الإشراف على يوروجست في وقت حاسم - في عام 2020، قدمت المفوضية الأوروبية (EC) اتصالها بشأن التحول الرقمي للعدالة في الاتحاد الأوروبي[1]. أحد الأهداف المحددة في وثيقة المفوضية الأوروبية هو تحسين التعاون القضائي عبر الحدود بين السلطات المختصة على المستوى الأوروبي. لهذا الغرض، أعلنت المفوضية أنها تبحث طرقًا لزيادة توافر البيانات القابلة للقراءة بواسطة الآلة والتي تنتجها الهيئة القضائية، من أجل إنشاء حلول ذكاء صناعي موثوقة تعتمد على تعلم الآلة لاستخدام أصحاب المصلحة المهتمين. بعد ذلك بوقت قصير، في أبريل 2021، قدمت المفوضية الأوروبية اقتراحًا لتنظيم الذكاء الاصطناعي يحدد قواعد موحدة للاتحاد الأوروبي، والمعروفة باسم قانون الذكاء الاصطناعي (AI Act)[2]. في كلا السياقين، شددت المفوضية على أن أي إجراءات مُطبقة يجب أن تكون بالكامل بما يتوافق مع الحقوق الأساسية للاتحاد الأوروبي، بما في ذلك الحق في حماية البيانات الشخصية. من شأن قانون الذكاء الاصطناعي أيضًا تعيين مشرف حماية البيانات الأوروبي (EDPS) كالسلطة المختصة للإشراف على المؤسسات الاتحاد الأوروبي وهي تطور وتستخدم أنظمة الذكاء الاصطناعي[3]. قد يمثل استخدام أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي في مجال العدالة خطرًا كبيرًا على الحقوق الأساسية للأفراد[4]. وهذا صحيح بشكل خاص فيما يتعلق بأنظمة الذكاء الاصطناعي التي قد تُستخدم لمساعدة السلطات القضائية في البحث الواقعي والقانوني، وكذلك في تفسير وتطبيق نتائج هذا البحث في حالة معينة. هذه المخاطر العالية غائبة إلى حد كبير في الحالات التي تُستخدم فيها أنظمة الذكاء الاصطناعي للأنشطة الإدارية البحتة العرضية والتي لا تؤثر على إدارة العدالة الفعلية في الحالات الفردية، مثل التخفي/التسمية المستعارة لقرارات/وثائق قضائية أو المهام الإدارية البحتة وتخصيص الموارد. يُعبر عن الآراء الرسمية لمشرف حماية البيانات الأوروبي (EDPS) والمجلس الأوروبي لحماية البيانات (EDPB) حول الإطار التنظيمي الجديد في رأيهما المشترك الصادر في يونيو 2021[5]. مع هذه المساهمة الكتابية بمناسبة الذكرى العشرين لتأسيس يوروجست، نحن نغتنم هذه الفرصة للتفكير في بعض قضايا حماية البيانات المترتبة على قواعد الذكاء الاصطناعي المقترحة من جهة، وعلى إصلاح يوروجست المستمر من جهة أخرى."},{"prompt":"معالجة الوثائق الآلية (ADP) مرشحًا واضحًا لحالة استخدام[15]. تثبت معالجة الوثائق الآلية أنها ذات قيمة خاصة لمعالجة أحجام كبيرة من الوثائق، خاصةً لتصنيفها، وتحويلها، وأرشفتها في صيغ قابلة للبحث. يمكن لهذه الأنواع من أنظمة الذكاء الاصطناعي ليس فقط تقليل الحاجة بشكل كبير لمعالجة الوثائق يدويًا، ولكنها يمكن أيضًا أن تسهم في تحسين دقة البيانات واكتمالها. التحويل من الصيغ الورقية إلى وثائق قابلة للبحث هو أيضًا الخطوة الأولى في استكشاف نشر أدوات أخرى مدفوعة بالذكاء الاصطناعي، مثل الترجمة الآلية عيد صياغة الفقرة دي","completion":"تعد معالجة الوثائق الآلية (ADP) أحد التطبيقات البارزة والواضحة للذكاء الاصطناعي، حيث تُظهر فائدتها بشكل خاص في معالجة كميات كبيرة من الوثائق، لا سيما في عمليات تصنيفها وتحويلها وأرشفتها بطريقة تسهل البحث فيها. أنظمة الذكاء الاصطناعي من هذا النوع لا تفقط تخفض بشكل كبير الحاجة إلى المعالجة اليدوية للوثائق، بل يمكن أن تساهم أيضًا في تعزيز دقة البيانات واستيفائها. علاوة على ذلك، تُعتبر عملية التحويل من الصيغ الورقية إلى الوثائق الرقمية القابلة للبحث الخطوة الأولى نحو تبني أدوات ذكاء اصطناعي متقدمة أخرى كالترجمة الآلية."},{"prompt":"Do a sample of a dialogue-filled, action-packed, intresting and exposition-filled crossover fanfic between the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

Tabane invents the IS Unit [IS: Infinite Stratos] when she [Tabane] is seventeen years old as a means of physically manifesting a contracted spirit via technological means for combat and [Tabane in this story] had her [Tabane’s] childhood friend and [Tabane’s] two-year younger cousin, the then fifteen-year old black-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also buxom and curvy, calm and soft-spoken but also headstrong and determined Yamato Nadeshiko [traditional Japanese beauty] samurai noble heiress Orimura Chifuyu [IS: Infinite Stratos] act as the first pilot of the IS Unit [IS: Infinite Stratos], [Chifuyu] wiping out several ICBMs along with carrier groups sent by the USA, the PRC and the Russian Federation to invade and divide Japan while [Chifuyu] in her [Chifuyu’s] IS Unit, an event [Chifuyu’s decimation of a significant portion of the US, mainland Chinese and Russian nuclear arsenal and naval forces] known as the “White Knight Incident” [IS: Infinite Stratos], although Chifuyu’s identity is covered by her [Chifuyu’s] IS Unit, allowing her [Chifuyu] and her [Chifuyu’s] older female cousin [Tabane] to go unnoticed as the US President, the American Joint Chiefs of Staffs, the Russian President and heads of the Russian military along with the Chinese President and CCP and PLA elites sign a peace treaty in Kyoto that essentially acknowledges that Russia and America started WW2 by supporting the Chiang Kai Shek-ruled KMT lead National Chinese State in the Chinese warlord era against Japan and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China and essentially hands the Korean peninsula, Sahlakin Island, the Kurils and Taiwan back to Japan under UN supervision. The effect on the Chinese and the Russians is the same as the Treaty of Brest-Litvosk, the Qing imperial family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchukuo returns in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and Mengjiang United Autonomous Government, ruled by the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin in Inner Mongolia’s Charhar and Suiyan regions are [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] restored as Japanese protectorates, with all Han living in these areas being deported back to China. The Japanese protectorate of the Far Eastern Republic is restored on the Russian East Coast, East Turkestan becomes independent as a Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire and Tibet is liberated under the rule of the Llamas. The Cantonia region of China is given to the Vietnamese, who experience a “revolution” that sees the restoration of the Imperial House of Ngyuen and the Empire of Vietnam soon later. For Russia, Siberia becomes independent and EU troops are sent into European Russia to “enforce the peace treaty” with Germany reclaiming all of Prussia from Poland and Russia. European Russia becomes a restored Russian Empire under the rule of the Romanovs with any KGB and Soviet Communist Party loyalists in Russia mysteriously disappearing before they can resist. After a series of revolutions in pro-Russian Central Europe and the Balkans, Austria regains all territory of the Austria-Hungarian Empire and puppets Serbia and Montenegro as Austrian satelite kingdoms along with Poland. For the United States, the effect is the same as the Treaty of Versailles. The Philippines comes under Japanese influence and Hawaii is liberated as a Kingdom under the restored House of Kalākaua, with the US being forced to accept its role in WW2 and WW1 and pay massive repatriations. Riots immediately emerge in Han China and the USA over the enforcement of the Treaty, although the unrest in the former is quickly put down and a restored Beiyang Government of the Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China is made the government of China, although the Ming dynasty’s imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu, is reenthroned to power in China. Things get worse when the IS unit is revealed to the public and the all-female student body IS Academy is built on a series of small Okinawan Islands that once held US bases. Before this, when Tabane is just 12 years old, she [Tabane] rescues her [Tabane’s] younger male cousin and Chifuyu’s biological younger brother, the black-haired, red-eyed, tall, muscular and slender, intellectually gifted and academically brilliant but lazy and laid-back, kind and loving young boy Orimura Ichika [IS: Infinite Stratos] from the Orimura clan when he [Ichika] is [Ichika] just a baby instead of Chifuyu like canon IS: Infinite Stratos. Ichika views Tabane as his [Tabane’s] older sister in this fic although he [Ichika] is sometimes exparated by her [Tabane’s] eccentricity. The then five-year Ichika helped immensely in the construction of the IS Unit before Chifuyu’s demonstration of its [the IS Unit’s] might [the White Knight Incident] although the young child [young Ichika] was of course clueless of its [the IS Unit’s true purpose]. Ichika in this fic hides the fact that he [Ichika] can pilot an IS unit and thus never attends the IS Academy, but lives a normal life. The excerpt should focus on Chifuyu trying out the very first IS Unit as Tabane bounces around her [Chifuyu], her [Tabane’s] bust bouncing with her [Tabane] as her [Tabane’s] assistant [five-year-old Ichika] looks on in confusion. Chifuyu looks for a moment and sees how Tabane’s young assistant [young Ichika] looks quite similar to her [Chifuyu’s] supposedly dead younger brother and [Chifuyu] wonders if Tabane also took someone else [baby Ichika] when she [Tabane] escaped from the Orimura clan, but [Chifuyu] ignored it. Chifuyu successfully equips the prototype IS Unit and [Chifuyu] takes off into the sky, [Chifuyu in this IS unit] being cheered on by young Ichika. Unfortunately, the test of the first IS Unit is detected by the American NASA and the NSA and is misinterpreted as a nuclear missile launch, as the Russian satellite state of North Korea fires off its [North Korea’s] nuclear missiles in response to the supposed nuclear ICBM. Chifuyu detects the missiles heading towards Japan using the prototype IS Unit’s advanced hacking capabilities and destroys them [the DPRK’s fired nukes] with ease using the prototype IS unit’s sword, [Chifuyu in the prototype IS unit] then sending a barrage of miniature missiles towards nuclear missile silos in Russia about to fire nukes at Japan, which succeeds. The prototype IS Unit then auto fires a bunch of small scale missiles towards a bunch of US ICBMs headed for Japan, destroying the US nukes. Chifuyu then lowers her [Chifuyu’s] altitude only for her [Chifuyu in the IS unit] to see the joint US-Russian-PRC naval force heading towards Japan. She [Chifuyu in the IS unit] then concentrates on her [Chifuyu’s] Onmyoudo and ninja skills, before [Chifuyu in the IS unit] dashing towards the joint strike group with a cry, [Chifuyu in the IS unit] not even noticing the IS Unit auto-deploy its force field shield to protect her [Chifuyu] from the barrage of bullets and missiles coming her [Chifuyu’s] way as she [Chifuyu in the IS unit] rips and tears through the strike team, the screams of the dying surrounding her [Chifuyu in the IS Unit] as she [Chifuyu in the IS unit] utilizes the IS unit’s battle rifle when her [Chifuyu’s] arms get tired. The excerpt should end with the spot where the joint strike team once stood being shown to be just a twisted spark of flames and destruction as Chifuyu flies away, as Tabane, watching everything from satelite cover, [Tabane] thinks she [Tabane] might have gone too far with her [Tabane’s] invention. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Given the complexity, depth, and the crossover nature of various elements from Musume Hyakka Jiten, Monmusu Kuesto!, and IS: Infinite Stratos, below is a sample of an intense and exposition-filled section that aligns with the setting and characters you've described: --- The sun was setting over the horizon as the golden skies cast a warm glow over the testing grounds. Tabane Shinonono's silhouette danced across the reflective surfaces of the machinery around her as the hum of power filled the air. The whirring of mechanical parts, each a testament to her genius, was accompanied by the rhythmic sounds of her shoes on the metal floor. Her pink hair, almost luminous in the fading light, bounced with each movement. Beside her, a young Ichika watched with a furrowed brow, the five-year-old's red eyes wide with both confusion and fascination. His black hair, tousled and unruly, contrasted with his crisp white lab coat — a stark difference from the precision and care evident in each piece of technology surrounding him. \\"Okay, Chifuyu-nee, remember the controls we went over,\\" Tabane chirped, her words punctuated by a bubbly laugh. The young inventor’s buxom figure made her seem like a vivacious spirit of innovation personified as she adjusted a few knobs on the complex control panel beside the IS Unit. Chifuyu Orimura, clad in a sleek prototype IS suit, gave a firm nod. \\"Got it. Let's do this,\\" she replied, the confidence in her voice never wavering. Her stature, as elegant as it was commanding, held the promise of a warrior ready for battle. Her grip tightened around the hilt of what was clearly more than a simple sword — a marvel of technology that was an intrinsic component of the IS system. The IS Unit's chest plate glowed, resonating with Chifuyu's intent. With a powerful leap, she took to the skies, propelled by the IS's thrusters. Below, Ichika cheered, clapping his hands in amazement as his \\"sister\\" defied gravity. As Chifuyu soared higher, her mind briefly wandered to Ichika's uncanny resemblance to her lost brother. She had long buried those thoughts, but seeing Ichika made her heart twinge with a forgotten pain. Yet, there was no time for doubt; for below, the distant sound of alarms signaled the start of a threat all too real. NASA and NSA alerts had already sparked panic, and as Chifuyu witnessed the missiles cut through the clouds aimed for her homeland, her resolve hardened. It wasn't just a test of technology anymore — it was a real battle. With deft movements, she wielded the IS's sophisticated systems to hack into the oncoming missiles' guidance, leading them astray even as she deflected and sliced through the threats with aerial grace. The clash of advanced weaponry against raw explosive power filled the air with a cacophony of violence, yet Chifuyu's determination never wavered. The sea off the coast of Japan churned violently as the combined naval forces of the U.S., Russia, and the PRC approached. Chifuyu's gaze was steely as she descended like a falcon, her IS Unit's force field shimmering into existence to shield her from the onslaught of firepower. Each enemy craft that fell before her sword seemed to unleash a symphony of desperation — the water becoming a canvas of their destruction. Tabane, monitoring the chaos from her satellite feeds, felt a pang of guilt as the extent of the IS Unit's power became apparent. Each explosion that lit up her screens was a testament to the deadly efficiency of her creation. She had created it to protect and to empower, but at what cost? Chifuyu, her breathing heavy but controlled, allowed herself a moment to glance back at the inferno she'd left in her wake. The once-mighty fleet was now nothing more than twisted metal and embers — a testament to the might of a single IS Unit and the will of its pilot. As the last echoes of battle faded, Chifuyu returned to the base, her silhouette cutting through the twilight sky. Ichika awaited her, a mix of awe and concern on his young face. But his admiration and pride for what she had accomplished was unmistakable. Tabane watched Chifuyu's descent, the impact of the events weighing heavily upon her. Her invention could save their nation, but it could also bring ruin. As Chifuyu's figure emerged from the smoke and debris, triumphant yet somber, Tabane couldn't help but wonder if her own genius had gone too far. The stage was set for a new world order, one where IS technology would reshape everything. But in that moment, Tabane knew their lives would never be the same again. ---"},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Here's what you can do: 1. **Restart Your Laptop**: Begin by simply restarting your HP Spectre to see if this resolves the issue. 2. **Windows Troubleshooting**: - Right-click on the Start menu and select Settings. - Go to the Update & Security section. - Click on Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters. - Select the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and run it to find and fix issues. 3. **Calibrate Touchscreen**: - Search for \\"Calibrate the screen for pen and touch input\\" in the Windows search box and open it. - Click on \\"Calibrate...\\" button under \\"Display\\" tab if you're able to (you mentioned calibration isn't working, but it's worth trying if accessible). 4. **Device Manager**: - Right-click on the Start button and select Device Manager. - Look for Human Interface Devices and expand it. - Find the HID-compliant touch screen and right-click on it, then choose Disable, and then re-enable it by right-clicking and selecting Enable. 5. **Driver Reinstallation**: - In Device Manager under Human Interface Devices, right-click on the HID-compliant touch screen and select Uninstall. - Restart the laptop and Windows should automatically reinstall the touch screen driver. 6. **Update System**: - Make sure your operating system is up to date with the latest Windows updates, as they can contain essential fixes and drivers. 7. **HP Support Assistant**: - Use HP Support Assistant to check for hardware issues and updates. You can download it from the HP website if it’s not already installed on your machine. 8. **External Factors**: - Make sure the screen is clean and free of dirt or liquids. - Check if a screen protector or case is interfering with the screen's functionality. If none of these steps work, there's a good chance that the touch screen might be partially damaged or malfunctioning due to a hardware issue. If your laptop is still under warranty, contact HP Support for a repair or replacement. Even if it's out of warranty, you can still consult with HP's or a professional repair service for advice on the cost of repair or potential replacement parts. Be cautious about attempting to physically repair the laptop yourself unless you have experience with such repairs, as you can cause further damage."},{"prompt":"Is there any file that i can edit to reset the normal orientation of linux os display in terminal","completion":"If your Linux OS display has been rotated or is displaying in an incorrect orientation, you can often correct this by using terminal commands to interact with the display settings. The method to reset the orientation will depend on the desktop environment you are using (e.g., GNOME, KDE, Xfce) or whether you're running a server without a desktop environment. For systems using X11, you might be using the \`xrandr\` command to change or reset the display orientation. For instance: \`\`\`bash xrandr --output <display-name> --rotate normal \`\`\` Replace \`<display-name>\` with the name of your display, which can be found by just typing \`xrandr\` without any arguments. In many desktop environments, display settings can also be managed through GUI tools, such as \\"Settings\\" in GNOME or \\"System Settings\\" in KDE. If you want to make the change persistent across reboots, the method will depend on your specific display manager and how the rotation was initially set: 1. **For LightDM** (used by desktop environments like XFCE), you might find configuration in \`/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\` or in files under \`/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/\`. 2. **For GDM** (used by GNOME), settings might be influenced by \`~/.config/monitors.xml\`. 3. **For SDDM** (used by KDE), settings might be in \`/etc/sddm.conf\`. If the rotation was set by a script on startup, you may want to check for custom startup scripts that might be changing the display orientation. Common locations for such scripts include \`~/.xinitrc\`, \`~/.xprofile\`, or system-wide in \`/etc/X11/xinit/\`. For systems without a display manager, if you are using a script or configuration file that is executed on boot to set the display orientation, you would have to locate that specific file. It could be a script in \`/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/\`, a service in systemd, or another system-wide configuration file. Remember, modifying system files or configurations can affect system behavior, so ensure you back up any configuration before making changes. Also, different distributions or setups might require different approaches, so always refer to the documentation specific to your distribution and setup for precise instructions."},{"prompt":"I am using xfce","completion":"XFCE uses the X11 window system typically, so you can use \`xrandr\` to change the orientation of the display. Open a terminal and use the following steps: 1. Find your display name by entering the command: \`\`\`bash xrandr | grep \\" connected\\" | cut -f1 -d \\" \\" \`\`\` This will list the names of connected displays. For example, it might be something like \`DP-1\` or \`HDMI-1\`. 2. To reset the display orientation to normal, use the command: \`\`\`bash xrandr --output DISPLAY_NAME --rotate normal \`\`\` Replace \`DISPLAY_NAME\` with the actual name you got from step 1. If you want this change to be persistent across restarts, you will likely need to create an autostart script that runs this command every time you log in to your XFCE session. To create an autostart script in XFCE, you can follow these steps: 1. Create a script with the \`xrandr\` command to reset the orientation. Use your favorite text editor, for example, using \`nano\`: \`\`\`bash nano ~/.screen_orientation_reset.sh \`\`\` And add the following lines (remember to replace \`DISPLAY_NAME\` with your actual display name): \`\`\`bash #!/bin/bash xrandr --output DISPLAY_NAME --rotate normal \`\`\` Save the file and exit the editor (in \`nano\`, press \`Ctrl + X\`, then \`Y\`, then \`Enter\` to save and exit). 2. Make the script executable: \`\`\`bash chmod +x ~/.screen_orientation_reset.sh \`\`\` 3. Add the script to XFCE's autostart: - Go to the XFCE Settings Manager - Navigate to \\"Session and Startup\\" - Go to the \\"Application Autostart\\" tab - Click on \\"Add\\" to create a new autostart entry - In the \\"Name\\" field, enter a descriptive name, like \\"Reset Screen Orientation\\" - In the \\"Command\\" field, enter the path to your script, e.g., \`/home/yourusername/.screen_orientation_reset.sh\` - Click \\"OK\\" to save Now, your script will run when you log in to your XFCE session, resetting the display orientation to normal each time."},{"prompt":"Do a sample of a dialogue-filled, action-packed, intresting and exposition-filled crossover fanfic between the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

These artifacts could occur for a variety of reasons, such as differences in the duration of chunks, buffer underruns, or even the method of playback. Let's go through some steps to potentially fix these issues: 1. Verify chunk sizes: Make sure that your TTS system sends the audio in uniform chunk sizes and that the sizes are conducive to smooth streaming. 2. Adjust buffer sizes: Sometimes the buffer size needs to be tuned for optimal performance. Too small of a buffer can lead to underruns, while too large of a buffer could introduce latency. 3. Remove Playback Delays: Any computation or processing between chunks can introduce delays. Make sure that the time it takes to process and play a chunk is consistent and minimal. 4. Use native formats if possible: Instead of converting chunks to a different format (like using \`AudioSegment.from_file\`), try to work with the native format that your TTS service provides, if it's compatible with your playback system. 5. Check pyaudio's callback mode: If possible, use pyaudio's callback mode instead of blocking mode to aid with smooth playback. Callback mode is designed to handle streaming uses cases. Here's a simplified example of using callback mode in pyaudio: \`\`\`python import pyaudio # Example of how to set up a stream using callback mode def callback(in_data, frame_count, time_info, status): data = get_next_chunk_somehow() # You’ll need to handle getting the data return (data, pyaudio.paContinue) p = pyaudio.PyAudio() stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=26000, output=True, stream_callback=callback) stream.start_stream() # Now the stream is running in the background calling the callback function while stream.is_active(): time.sleep(0.1) # Keep your main program running stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() \`\`\` Please note that \`get_next_chunk_somehow()\` is just a placeholder to indicate where you would retrieve the next chunk of data from the TTS service. To apply the callback mode to your code, you would need to reorganize your logic so that the callback function gets called with each new chunk from the streaming API. Finally, here’s a key point about using \`edge_tts\`: if you're noticing artifacts it could also be due to the TTS service itself or the way in which the \`edge_tts\` library fetches and stitches together audio segments. Ensure that you are using the latest version of the \`edge_tts\` library and check if there are any open issues or updates regarding streaming glitches."},{"prompt":"make the callback function please","completion":"To integrate the callback function into your streaming logic, you will need to create a queue or buffer to hold your \`edge_tts\` chunks, which the callback function will consume. Please note that the code below is a conceptual example; you might need to adjust it for your specific use case and ensure proper exception handling based on the behavior of the \`edge_tts\` library. Here's an example of how you might set this up with a queue: \`\`\`python import asyncio import edge_tts import pyaudio import queue TEXT = \\"Hello World!\\" VOICE = \\"en-GB-SoniaNeural\\" p = pyaudio.PyAudio() audio_queue = queue.Queue() stream_ended = False def callback(in_data, frame_count, time_info, status): try: # Retrieve data from the queue chunk = audio_queue.get_nowait() except queue.Empty: # No data available if stream_ended: return (None, pyaudio.paComplete) else: # Return silence if no data data = b'x00' * frame_count * 2 # assuming a sample width of 2 bytes return (data, pyaudio.paContinue) # Return data and continue playback return (chunk, pyaudio.paContinue) # Open stream using callback stream = p.open( format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=26000, output=True, stream_callback=callback ) async def stream_tts(text: str, voice: str): global stream_ended communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice) async for chunk in communicate.stream(): if chunk[\\"type\\"] == \\"audio\\": # Put the received chunk into the queue audio_queue.put(chunk[\\"data\\"]) if chunk.get('end', False): stream_ended = True break if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # Start the stream stream.start_stream() # Run the asyncio event loop loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(stream_tts(TEXT, VOICE)) # Wait for stream to complete playback while stream.is_active(): loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(0.1)) # Close the stream and terminate PyAudio stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() \`\`\` This code assumes you are receiving chunks of audio data as bytes (compatible with \`pyaudio.paInt16\` format), which is then placed directly into the queue without conversion. When the \`callback\` function is called by PyAudio, it attempts to get an audio chunk from the queue without waiting (\`get_nowait\`), and plays it. If the queue is empty, the callback function generates silent frames to prevent underflows until new data arrives. Please keep in mind that this is a general example, designed to give you a starting point. You may need to adjust the sample rates, formats, and handle exceptions or other details based on the \`edge_tts\` library's behavior and the audio specifications you're working with."},{"prompt":"The sound is robotic, you forgot AudioSegment.from_file(BytesIO(chunk[“data”]), format=“mp3”)","completion":"If you're receiving MP3 data from \`edge_tts\` and need to use \`AudioSegment\` to convert it to raw audio data for \`pyaudio\`, you'll need to do so in a way that doesn't introduce delay or block the PyAudio callback. Since decoding can take an unpredictable amount of time, it's recommended to perform this task asynchronously outside the callback and then place the raw audio data into the queue. Here's a modification of the previous example that incorporates decoding of MP3 chunks using \`AudioSegment\`. You would need to install the \`pydub\` and \`ffmpeg\` or \`avconv\` which \`pydub\` uses under the hood: \`\`\`python import asyncio import edge_tts import pyaudio import queue from pydub import AudioSegment from io import BytesIO TEXT = \\"Hello World!\\" VOICE = \\"en-GB-SoniaNeural\\" p = pyaudio.PyAudio() audio_queue = queue.Queue() stream_ended = False # PyAudio callback function def callback(in_data, frame_count, time_info, status): try: chunk = audio_queue.get_nowait() except queue.Empty: if stream_ended: return (None, pyaudio.paComplete) else: data = b'x00' * frame_count * 2 # assuming a sample width of 2 bytes return (data, pyaudio.paContinue) return (chunk, pyaudio.paContinue) # Function to process and enqueue audio async def process_audio(data: bytes): try: # Decode MP3 to raw audio using pydub audio_segment = AudioSegment.from_file( BytesIO(data), format=\\"mp3\\" ) # Add the decoded raw audio to the queue audio_queue.put(audio_segment.raw_data) except Exception as e: print(\\"Error processing audio chunk:\\", e) # Async coroutine for streaming and decoding TTS async def stream_tts(text: str, voice: str): global stream_ended communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice) async for chunk in communicate.stream(): if chunk[\\"type\\"] == \\"audio\\": # Process and enqueue audio asynchronously await process_audio(chunk[\\"data\\"]) if chunk.get('end', False): stream_ended = True break # Open the PyAudio stream with the specified parameters stream = p.open( format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=26000, output=True, stream_callback=callback ) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # Start the PyAudio stream stream.start_stream() # Run the asyncio event loop loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(stream_tts(TEXT, VOICE)) # Wait for stream to complete playback while stream.is_active(): loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(0.1)) # Close the stream and terminate PyAudio stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() \`\`\` Be sure to have \`ffmpeg\` or \`avconv\` in your system's PATH, as \`pydub\` relies on them to process audio formats like MP3. In this updated example, we keep the \`stream_tts\` function as an asynchronous coroutine that receives chunks from \`edge_tts\`, but now each audio chunk is decoded asynchronously by \`process_audio\` before being put into the queue. The callback function continues to fetch raw audio data from the queue as before. Keep in mind that this is still a simplified setup and may need additional error handling, and configuration to work with different audio sources, formats, and system environments. It is also important to ensure that the rate at which the audio is decoded and enqueued matches or exceeds the rate at which the callback function consumes the audio data, otherwise, you might still experience underflow and resulting audio artifacts."},{"prompt":"I hear nothing when i launch the script...","completion":"It seems there might be an issue with the implementation of the processing and queuing of audio data from \`edge_tts\`.

Your life is made up of only two kinds of things – positive things and negative things. Each area of your life, whether it’s your health, money, relationships, work, or happiness, is either positive or negative to you. You have plenty of money or you lack money. You are brimming with health or you lack health. Your relationships are happy or difficult. Your work is exciting and successful or dissatisfying and unsuccessful. You are filled with happiness or you don’t feel good a lot of the time. You have good years or bad years, good times or bad times, good days or bad days. If you have more negative things than positive things in your life, then something is very wrong and you know it. You see other people who are happy and fulfilled and whose lives are full of great things, and something tells you that you deserve all that too. And you’re right; you do deserve a life overflowing with good things. Most people who have a great life don’t realize exactly what it was that they did to get it. But they did do something. They used the power that is the cause of everything good in life . . . Without exception, every person who has a great life used love to achieve it. The power to have all the positive and good things in life is love! Love has been talked about and written about since the beginning of time, in every religion, and by every great thinker, philosopher, prophet, and leader. But many of us have not truly understood their wise words. Even though their teachings were specifically for people in their time, their one truth and message to the world is still the same today: love, because when you love you are using the greatest power in the universe. The Force of Love floral “Love is an element which though physically unseen is as real as air or water. It is an acting, living, moving force . . . it moves in waves and currents like those of the ocean.” Prentice Mulford (1834-1891) NEW THOUGHT AUTHOR power graphic The kind of love that the greatest thinkers and saviors of the world talked about is very different from what most people understand love to be. It is much more than loving your family, friends, and favorite things, because love is not just a feeling: love is a positive force. Love is not weak, feeble, or soft. Love is the positive force of life! Love is the cause of everything positive and good. There are not a hundred different positive forces in life; there is only one. Nature’s great powers, like gravity and electromagnetism, are invisible to our senses, but their power is indisputable. Likewise, the force of love is invisible to us, but its power is in fact far greater than any of nature’s powers. The evidence of its power can be seen everywhere in the world: without love, there is no life. Take a moment to think about it: What would the world be without love? First of all, you wouldn’t even exist; without love you couldn’t have been born. None of your family and friends would have been born either. In fact, there wouldn’t be a single human being on the planet. If the force of love ceased today, the entire human race would decrease and eventually die out. Every single invention, discovery, and human creation came from the love in a human heart. If it were not for the love of the Wright Brothers, we could not fly in an airplane. If it were not for the love of scientists, inventors, and discoverers, we would not have electricity, heating, or light; nor would we be able to drive a car or use a phone, appliance, or any of the technology that makes life easier and more comfortable. Without the love of architects and builders, there would be no homes, buildings, or cities. Without love, there would be no medicines, doctors, or emergency facilities. No teachers, schools, or education. There would be no books, no paintings, and no music, because all of these things are created from the positive force of love. Take a look around you right now. Whatever you see that is a human creation would not be there without love. floral graphic “Take away love and our earth is a tomb.” Robert Browning (1812-1889) POET floral graphic Love Is the Force That Moves You Everything you want to be, do, or have comes from love. Without love, you wouldn’t move. There would be no positive force to propel you to get up in the morning, to work, play, dance, talk, learn, listen to music, or do anything at all. You’d be like a stone statue. It is the positive force of love that inspires you to move and gives you the desire to be, do, or have anything. The positive force of love can create anything good, increase the good things, and change anything negative in your life. You have the power over your health, your wealth, your career, your relationships, and every area of your life. And that power – love – is inside you! But if you have the power over your life, and that power is inside you, why isn’t your life amazing? Why isn’t every area of your life magnificent? Why don’t you have everything you want? Why haven’t you been able to do everything you want to do? Why aren’t you filled with joy every day? The answer is: because you have a choice. You have a choice whether to love and harness the positive force – or not. And whether you realize it or not, every day of your life – every moment of your life – you have been making this choice. Without exception, every single time you experienced something good in your life, you loved and harnessed love’s positive force. And every single time you experienced something not good, you didn’t love, and the result was negativity. Love is the cause of all the good things in your life, and a lack of love is the cause of all the negative things and all the pain and suffering. Tragically, a lack of knowledge and understanding of the power of love is clear in people’s lives across the planet today – and in the entire history of humanity. floral graphic “Love is the most powerful and still most unknown energy in the world.” Pierre Teilharde Chardin (1812-1889) PRIEST AND PHILOSOPHER floral graphic Now, you are receiving the knowledge of the one and only power to all the good things in life, and you will be able to use it to change your entire life. But first, you must understand exactly how love works. floral graphic The Law of Love The universe is governed by natural laws. We can fly in an airplane because aviation works in harmony with natural laws. The laws of physics didn’t change for us to be able to fly, but we found a way to work in accordance with the natural laws, and by doing so we can fly. Just as laws of physics govern aviation, electricity, and gravity, there is a law that governs love. To harness the positive force of love and change your life, you must understand its law, the most powerful law in the universe – the law of attraction. From the greatest to the smallest – the law of attraction is what holds every star in the universe and forms every atom and molecule. The force of attraction of the sun holds the planets in our solar system, keeping them from hurtling into space. The force of attraction in gravity holds you and every person, animal, plant, and mineral on earth. The force of attraction can be seen in all of nature from a flower attracting bees or a seed attracting nutrients from the soil, to every living creature being attracted to its own species. The force of attraction operates through all the animals on the earth, fish in the sea, and birds in the sky, leading them to multiply and form herds, schools, and flocks. The force of attraction holds together the cells of your body, the materials of your house, and the furniture you sit on, and it holds your car to the road and the water in your glass. Every object you use is held together by the force of attraction. Attraction is the force that draws people to other people. It draws people to form cities and nations, groups, clubs, and societies where they share common interests. It is the force that pulls one person to science and another to cooking; it pulls people to various sports or to different styles of music, to certain animals and pets. Attraction is the force that draws you to your favorite things and places, and it’s the force that draws you to your friends and the people you love. floral graphic The Attractive Force of Love So what is the force of attraction? The force of attraction is the force of love! Attraction is love. When you feel an attraction to your favorite food, you’re feeling love for that food; without attraction, you wouldn’t feel anything. All food would be the same to you. You wouldn’t know what you love or what you don’t love, because you wouldn’t be attracted to anything. You wouldn’t be attracted to another person, a particular city, house, car, sport, job, music, clothes, or anything, because it’s through the force of attraction that you feel love! floral graphic “The law of attraction or the law of love . . . they are one and the same.” Charles Haanel (1866-1949) NEW THOUGHT AUTHOR floral graphic The law of attraction is the law of love, and it is the all-powerful law that keeps everything in harmony, from countless galaxies to atoms. It is operating in everything and through everything in the universe. And it is the law that is operating in your life. In universal terms, the law of attraction says: like attracts like. What that means in simple terms for your life is: what you give out, you receive back. Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Whatever you give, by the law of attraction, is exactly what you attract back to yourself. floral graphic “To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” Isaac Newton (1643-1727) MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICIST give and receive graphic Every action of giving creates an opposite action of receiving and what you receive is always equal to what you’ve given. Whatever you give out in life, must return to you. It is the physics and the mathematics of the universe. Give positivity, you receive back positivity; give negativity, you receive back negativity. Give positivity and you receive back a life full of positive things. Give negativity and you receive back a life filled with negative things. And how do you give positivity or negativity? Through your thoughts and your feelings! In any moment, you’re giving either positive thoughts or negative thoughts. You’re giving either positive feelings or negative feelings. And whether they’re positive or negative will determine what you receive back in your life. All the people, circumstances, and events that make up every moment of your life are being attracted back to you through the thoughts and feelings you’re giving out. Life doesn’t just happen to you; you receive everything in your life based on what you’ve given. floral graphic “Give, and it will be given to you . . . for by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.” Jesus (circa 5 BC-circa AD 30) FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY, IN LUKE 6:38 floral graphic What you give – you receive. Give help and support to a friend when he’s moving house, and most surely that help and support will return to you with lightning speed. Give anger to a family member who let you down, and that anger will also return to you, clothed in the circumstances of your life. You are creating your life with your thoughts and your feelings. Whatever you think and feel creates everything that happens to you and everything you experience in your life. If you think and feel, “I’ve got a difficult and stressful day today,” then you will attract back to you all people, circumstances, and events that will make your day difficult and stressful. If you think and feel, “Life is really good to me,” you will attract back to you all people, circumstances, and events that will make life really good for you. You Are a Magnet The law of attraction is unfailingly giving you every single thing in your life based on what you’re giving out. You magnetize and receive the circumstances of wealth, health, relationships, your job, and every single event and experience in your life, based on the thoughts and feelings you’re giving out. Give out positive thoughts and feelings about money, and you magnetize positive circumstances, people, and events that bring more money to you. Give out negative thoughts and feelings about money, and you magnetize negative circumstances, people, and events that cause you to have a lack of money. floral graphic “Whether humanity will consciously follow the law of love, I do not know. But that need not disturb me. The law will work just as the law of gravitation works whether we accept it or not.” Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) INDIAN POLITICAL LEADER floral graphic As surely as you think and feel, the law of attraction is responding to you. It doesn’t matter whether your thoughts and feelings are good or bad, you are giving them out, and they will return to you as automatically and precisely as an echo returns the same words you send out. But this means that you can change your life by changing your thoughts and feelings. Give positive thoughts and feelings, and you will change your entire life! floral graphic Positive and Negative Thoughts Your thoughts are both the words you hear in your head and the words you speak out loud. When you say to somebody, “What a beautiful day,” you had the thought first and then spoke the words. Your thoughts also become your actions. When you get out of bed in the morning, you had the thought of getting out of bed before you took action. You can’t take any action without thinking the thought first. It’s your thoughts that determine whether your words and actions will be positive or negative. But how do you know whether your thoughts are positive or negative? Your thoughts are positive when they are thoughts of what you want and love! And negative thoughts are thoughts of what you don’t want and don’t love. It is that simple and that easy. Whatever you want in your life, you want it because you love it. Take a moment and think about it. You don’t want things you don’t love, do you? Every person only wants what they love; nobody wants what they don’t love. When you think or talk about the things you want and love, such as, “I love those shoes, they’re beautiful,” your thoughts are positive, and those positive thoughts will come back to you as the things you love – beautiful shoes. When you think or talk about the things you don’t want and don’t love, such as “Look at the price of those shoes, that’s highway robbery,” your thoughts are negative, and those negative thoughts will come back to you as the things you don’t love – things that are too expensive for you. Most people think and talk about what they don’t love more than they think and talk about what they love. They give out more negativity than love, and in doing so they are inadvertently depriving themselves of all the good things in life. It’s impossible to have a great life without love. People who have great lives think and talk about what they love more than what they don’t love! And people who are struggling think and talk about what they don’t love more than what they do love! floral graphic “One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life. That word is love.” Sophocles (496-406 BC) GREEK PLAYWRIGHT floral graphic Talk About What You Love When you talk about any difficulties with money, a relationship, an illness, or even that the profits of your business are down, you are not talking about what you love. When you talk about a bad event in the news, or a person or situation that annoyed or frustrated you, you are not talking about what you love. Talking about the bad day you had, being late for an appointment, getting caught in traffic, or missing the bus are all talking about what you don’t love. There are many little things that happen each day; if you get caught up in talking about what you don’t love, every one of those little things brings more struggle and difficulty to your life. You have to talk about the good news of the day. Talk about the appointment that went well. Talk about how you love being on time. Talk about how good it is to be full of health. Talk about the profits you want your business to achieve. Talk about the situations and interactions you had in your day that went well. You have to talk about what you love, to bring what you love to you. Bird in Cage If you parrot negative things and squawk about the things you don’t love, you are literally jailing yourself, like a parrot in a cage. Every time you talk about what you don’t love, you are adding another bar to the cage and you are locking yourself away from all the good. People who have great lives talk more about what they love. By doing so, they gain unlimited access to all the good in life, and they are as free as the birds that soar in the sky. To have a great life, break the bars of the cage that is jailing you; give love, talk only about what you love, and love will set you free! Soaring Bird “Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.” Jesus (circa 5 BC-circa AD 30) FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY, IN LUKE 6:38 floral graphic Nothing is impossible for the force of love. No matter who you are, no matter what situation you may be facing, the force of love can set you free. I know of a woman who through love alone broke the bars that caged her. She had been left in poverty and faced with bringing up her children by herself after twenty years of an abusive marriage. Despite the extreme hardship she faced, this woman never allowed resentment, anger, or any ill feeling to take root inside her. She never talked negatively about her ex-husband but instead gave only positive thoughts and words about her dream of a new, perfect, beautiful husband, and her dream of traveling to Europe. Even though she had no money to travel, she applied for and got a passport and bought small items she would need on her dream trip to Europe. Well, she did meet her perfect and beautiful new husband. And after marrying, they moved to her husband’s home in Spain overlooking the ocean, where she now lives in happiness. This woman refused to talk about what she didn’t love but instead chose to give love and think and talk about what she loved, and in doing so, she set herself free from hardship and suffering, and received a beautiful life. You can change your life, because you have an unlimited ability to think and talk about what you love, and so you have an unlimited ability to bring everything good in life to you! However, the power you have is far greater than giving positive thoughts and words of the things you love, because the law of attraction is responding to your thoughts and your feelings. You have to feel love to harness its power! floral graphic “Love is the fulfilling of the law.” Saint Paul (CIRCA 5-67) CHRISTIAN APOSTLE, IN ROMANS 13:10 floral graphic POINTS OF POWER Love is not weak, feeble, or soft. Love is the positive force of life! Love is the cause of everything positive and good. Everything you want to be, do, or have comes from love. The positive force of love can create anything good, increase the good things, and change anything negative in your life. Every day, in every moment, you make the choice whether to love and harness the positive force – or not. The law of attraction is the law of love, and it is the law that is operating in your life. Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Give positivity, you receive back positivity; give negativity, you receive back negativity. Life doesn’t happen to you; you receive everything in your life based on what you’ve given. Whether your thoughts and feelings are good or bad, they return as automatically and precisely as an echo. People who have great lives think and talk about what they love more than what they don’t love! Talk about the good news of the day. Talk about what you love. And bring what you love to you. You have an unlimited ability to think and talk about what you love, and so you have an unlimited ability to bring everything good in life to you! Love, because when you love you are using the greatest power in the universe.","completion":"After examining the text provided, it appears to be centered around the philosophy of love and its transformative power in one's life, as understood by various historical figures and authors. Below are the key points and habits that can be learned from this philosophy: 1. **Universal Power of Love**: The text starts with a quote by Alexander Graham Bell that acknowledges the existence of a powerful force but doesn't define it. The text then identifies that force as love, the cause of all positive and good things in life. 2. **Simplicity of Life's Dichotomy**: Life is presented as being made up of positive and negative things. One's health, wealth, relationships, work, and happiness either contribute positively or negatively to their existence. 3. **Role of Love in Achievement**: According to the text, individuals who lead fulfilling lives have used love, knowingly or unknowingly, as a catalyst for achieving their desired outcomes. 4. **Love as a Universal Law**: Love is likened to natural forces like gravity and electromagnetism, which, although invisible, have undeniable power. The laws of love are similar in that they have an unobservable but immensely powerful influence on the world. 5. **The Law of Attraction**: The text explains that the law of attraction, essentially the same as the law of love, dictates that like attracts like. Whatever you put out into the world in terms of thoughts and feelings will attract similar experiences and outcomes. 6. **Giving and Receiving**: It's stated that whatever one gives out in life is proportional to what they receive. The implication is that positive thoughts and feelings will result in positive life experiences, while negative ones will attract negativity. 7. **Thoughts and Feelings as Creative Forces**: One's thoughts and feelings are presented as the vehicles through which their life is shaped. Positive thoughts and feelings supposedly create a life filled with positive things. 8. **Talking About Love**: The text encourages focusing on what one loves rather than speaking about negative things. It's advised to talk about and reflect upon the positive aspects of your day or the good news rather than dwelling on negativity. 9. **Choice and Ability**: The text emphasizes that individuals always have a choice to love and harness its positive force. It encourages readers to actively choose love in every situation to realize its benefits. 10. **Actions and Positive Energy**: It's suggested that actively demonstrating love in one's actions invites more positivity into one's life. Engaging in loving actions sets the stage for receiving love and positive experiences in return. 11. **Habits to Cultivate Love and Positivity**: - Reflect on the things you love daily. - Express gratitude for positive experiences and things you value. - Consciously choose to focus on positive thoughts and feelings. - Encourage positive conversations and avoid dwelling on negative subjects. - Visualize and act towards the positive circumstances you desire. - Practice acts of kindness and express love in your actions. The overarching message of the text is that love is not only an emotional sentiment but also a profound and potent energy that governs the universe's natural laws. Harnessing the power of love through positive thoughts, feelings, and actions can potentially lead to a fulfilling and joyful life. It also underscores the concept of the law of attraction and its principle that one attracts what they focus on, whether it's positive or negative. The text serves as an encouraging reminder of our ability to shape our lives through the power of love and the choices we make daily."},{"prompt":"read it write down everything you learn from it What this power is I cannot say; all I know is that it exists.” Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) INVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE Floral graphic Life is simple.

You have a choice whether to love and harness the positive force – or not. And whether you realize it or not, every day of your life – every moment of your life – you have been making this choice. Without exception, every single time you experienced something good in your life, you loved and harnessed love’s positive force. And every single time you experienced something not good, you didn’t love, and the result was negativity. Love is the cause of all the good things in your life, and a lack of love is the cause of all the negative things and all the pain and suffering. Tragically, a lack of knowledge and understanding of the power of love is clear in people’s lives across the planet today – and in the entire history of humanity. floral graphic “Love is the most powerful and still most unknown energy in the world.” Pierre Teilharde Chardin (1812-1889) PRIEST AND PHILOSOPHER floral graphic Now, you are receiving the knowledge of the one and only power to all the good things in life, and you will be able to use it to change your entire life. But first, you must understand exactly how love works. floral graphic The Law of Love The universe is governed by natural laws. We can fly in an airplane because aviation works in harmony with natural laws. The laws of physics didn’t change for us to be able to fly, but we found a way to work in accordance with the natural laws, and by doing so we can fly. Just as laws of physics govern aviation, electricity, and gravity, there is a law that governs love. To harness the positive force of love and change your life, you must understand its law, the most powerful law in the universe – the law of attraction. From the greatest to the smallest – the law of attraction is what holds every star in the universe and forms every atom and molecule. The force of attraction of the sun holds the planets in our solar system, keeping them from hurtling into space. The force of attraction in gravity holds you and every person, animal, plant, and mineral on earth. The force of attraction can be seen in all of nature from a flower attracting bees or a seed attracting nutrients from the soil, to every living creature being attracted to its own species. The force of attraction operates through all the animals on the earth, fish in the sea, and birds in the sky, leading them to multiply and form herds, schools, and flocks. The force of attraction holds together the cells of your body, the materials of your house, and the furniture you sit on, and it holds your car to the road and the water in your glass. Every object you use is held together by the force of attraction. Attraction is the force that draws people to other people. It draws people to form cities and nations, groups, clubs, and societies where they share common interests. It is the force that pulls one person to science and another to cooking; it pulls people to various sports or to different styles of music, to certain animals and pets. Attraction is the force that draws you to your favorite things and places, and it’s the force that draws you to your friends and the people you love. floral graphic The Attractive Force of Love So what is the force of attraction? The force of attraction is the force of love! Attraction is love. When you feel an attraction to your favorite food, you’re feeling love for that food; without attraction, you wouldn’t feel anything. All food would be the same to you. You wouldn’t know what you love or what you don’t love, because you wouldn’t be attracted to anything. You wouldn’t be attracted to another person, a particular city, house, car, sport, job, music, clothes, or anything, because it’s through the force of attraction that you feel love! floral graphic “The law of attraction or the law of love . . . they are one and the same.” Charles Haanel (1866-1949) NEW THOUGHT AUTHOR floral graphic The law of attraction is the law of love, and it is the all-powerful law that keeps everything in harmony, from countless galaxies to atoms. It is operating in everything and through everything in the universe. And it is the law that is operating in your life. In universal terms, the law of attraction says: like attracts like. What that means in simple terms for your life is: what you give out, you receive back. Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Whatever you give, by the law of attraction, is exactly what you attract back to yourself. floral graphic “To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” Isaac Newton (1643-1727) MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICIST give and receive graphic Every action of giving creates an opposite action of receiving and what you receive is always equal to what you’ve given. Whatever you give out in life, must return to you. It is the physics and the mathematics of the universe. Give positivity, you receive back positivity; give negativity, you receive back negativity. Give positivity and you receive back a life full of positive things. Give negativity and you receive back a life filled with negative things. And how do you give positivity or negativity? Through your thoughts and your feelings! In any moment, you’re giving either positive thoughts or negative thoughts. You’re giving either positive feelings or negative feelings. And whether they’re positive or negative will determine what you receive back in your life. All the people, circumstances, and events that make up every moment of your life are being attracted back to you through the thoughts and feelings you’re giving out. Life doesn’t just happen to you; you receive everything in your life based on what you’ve given. floral graphic “Give, and it will be given to you . . . for by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.” Jesus (circa 5 BC-circa AD 30) FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY, IN LUKE 6:38 floral graphic What you give – you receive. Give help and support to a friend when he’s moving house, and most surely that help and support will return to you with lightning speed. Give anger to a family member who let you down, and that anger will also return to you, clothed in the circumstances of your life. You are creating your life with your thoughts and your feelings. Whatever you think and feel creates everything that happens to you and everything you experience in your life. If you think and feel, “I’ve got a difficult and stressful day today,” then you will attract back to you all people, circumstances, and events that will make your day difficult and stressful. If you think and feel, “Life is really good to me,” you will attract back to you all people, circumstances, and events that will make life really good for you. You Are a Magnet The law of attraction is unfailingly giving you every single thing in your life based on what you’re giving out. You magnetize and receive the circumstances of wealth, health, relationships, your job, and every single event and experience in your life, based on the thoughts and feelings you’re giving out. Give out positive thoughts and feelings about money, and you magnetize positive circumstances, people, and events that bring more money to you. Give out negative thoughts and feelings about money, and you magnetize negative circumstances, people, and events that cause you to have a lack of money. floral graphic “Whether humanity will consciously follow the law of love, I do not know. But that need not disturb me. The law will work just as the law of gravitation works whether we accept it or not.” Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) INDIAN POLITICAL LEADER floral graphic As surely as you think and feel, the law of attraction is responding to you. It doesn’t matter whether your thoughts and feelings are good or bad, you are giving them out, and they will return to you as automatically and precisely as an echo returns the same words you send out. But this means that you can change your life by changing your thoughts and feelings. Give positive thoughts and feelings, and you will change your entire life! floral graphic Positive and Negative Thoughts Your thoughts are both the words you hear in your head and the words you speak out loud. When you say to somebody, “What a beautiful day,” you had the thought first and then spoke the words. Your thoughts also become your actions. When you get out of bed in the morning, you had the thought of getting out of bed before you took action. You can’t take any action without thinking the thought first. It’s your thoughts that determine whether your words and actions will be positive or negative. But how do you know whether your thoughts are positive or negative? Your thoughts are positive when they are thoughts of what you want and love! And negative thoughts are thoughts of what you don’t want and don’t love. It is that simple and that easy. Whatever you want in your life, you want it because you love it. Take a moment and think about it. You don’t want things you don’t love, do you? Every person only wants what they love; nobody wants what they don’t love. When you think or talk about the things you want and love, such as, “I love those shoes, they’re beautiful,” your thoughts are positive, and those positive thoughts will come back to you as the things you love – beautiful shoes. When you think or talk about the things you don’t want and don’t love, such as “Look at the price of those shoes, that’s highway robbery,” your thoughts are negative, and those negative thoughts will come back to you as the things you don’t love – things that are too expensive for you. Most people think and talk about what they don’t love more than they think and talk about what they love. They give out more negativity than love, and in doing so they are inadvertently depriving themselves of all the good things in life. It’s impossible to have a great life without love. People who have great lives think and talk about what they love more than what they don’t love! And people who are struggling think and talk about what they don’t love more than what they do love! floral graphic “One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life. That word is love.” Sophocles (496-406 BC) GREEK PLAYWRIGHT floral graphic Talk About What You Love When you talk about any difficulties with money, a relationship, an illness, or even that the profits of your business are down, you are not talking about what you love. When you talk about a bad event in the news, or a person or situation that annoyed or frustrated you, you are not talking about what you love. Talking about the bad day you had, being late for an appointment, getting caught in traffic, or missing the bus are all talking about what you don’t love. There are many little things that happen each day; if you get caught up in talking about what you don’t love, every one of those little things brings more struggle and difficulty to your life. You have to talk about the good news of the day. Talk about the appointment that went well. Talk about how you love being on time. Talk about how good it is to be full of health. Talk about the profits you want your business to achieve. Talk about the situations and interactions you had in your day that went well. You have to talk about what you love, to bring what you love to you. Bird in Cage If you parrot negative things and squawk about the things you don’t love, you are literally jailing yourself, like a parrot in a cage. Every time you talk about what you don’t love, you are adding another bar to the cage and you are locking yourself away from all the good. People who have great lives talk more about what they love. By doing so, they gain unlimited access to all the good in life, and they are as free as the birds that soar in the sky. To have a great life, break the bars of the cage that is jailing you; give love, talk only about what you love, and love will set you free! Soaring Bird “Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.” Jesus (circa 5 BC-circa AD 30) FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY, IN LUKE 6:38 floral graphic Nothing is impossible for the force of love. No matter who you are, no matter what situation you may be facing, the force of love can set you free. I know of a woman who through love alone broke the bars that caged her. She had been left in poverty and faced with bringing up her children by herself after twenty years of an abusive marriage. Despite the extreme hardship she faced, this woman never allowed resentment, anger, or any ill feeling to take root inside her. She never talked negatively about her ex-husband but instead gave only positive thoughts and words about her dream of a new, perfect, beautiful husband, and her dream of traveling to Europe. Even though she had no money to travel, she applied for and got a passport and bought small items she would need on her dream trip to Europe. Well, she did meet her perfect and beautiful new husband. And after marrying, they moved to her husband’s home in Spain overlooking the ocean, where she now lives in happiness. This woman refused to talk about what she didn’t love but instead chose to give love and think and talk about what she loved, and in doing so, she set herself free from hardship and suffering, and received a beautiful life. You can change your life, because you have an unlimited ability to think and talk about what you love, and so you have an unlimited ability to bring everything good in life to you! However, the power you have is far greater than giving positive thoughts and words of the things you love, because the law of attraction is responding to your thoughts and your feelings. You have to feel love to harness its power! floral graphic “Love is the fulfilling of the law.” Saint Paul (CIRCA 5-67) CHRISTIAN APOSTLE, IN ROMANS 13:10 floral graphic POINTS OF POWER Love is not weak, feeble, or soft. Love is the positive force of life! Love is the cause of everything positive and good. Everything you want to be, do, or have comes from love. The positive force of love can create anything good, increase the good things, and change anything negative in your life. Every day, in every moment, you make the choice whether to love and harness the positive force – or not. The law of attraction is the law of love, and it is the law that is operating in your life. Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Give positivity, you receive back positivity; give negativity, you receive back negativity. Life doesn’t happen to you; you receive everything in your life based on what you’ve given. Whether your thoughts and feelings are good or bad, they return as automatically and precisely as an echo. People who have great lives think and talk about what they love more than what they don’t love! Talk about the good news of the day. Talk about what you love. And bring what you love to you. You have an unlimited ability to think and talk about what you love, and so you have an unlimited ability to bring everything good in life to you! Love, because when you love you are using the greatest power in the universe.","completion":"From the text provided, here's what can be learned: 1. The power of love is considered the greatest power in the universe and the cause of everything positive and good in life. 2. Love is described as a positive force – more than just an emotion or feeling – and is said to be the reason behind successful and happy lives. 3. The force of love is equated to other natural forces like gravity and electromagnetism; it is invisible but powerful and necessary for life. 4. Without love, human creations and achievements such as technology, art, and comfort would not exist. 5. Positive thoughts and feelings associated with love can shape and improve one's life, while negative thoughts can lead to a lack of good things and suffering. 6. The power of love works through the law of attraction, a universal law that dictates like attracts like, meaning that the energy one puts out into the world returns to them. 7. The law of attraction operates in every aspect of the universe, from the macroscopic level of galaxies to the microscopic level of atoms. 8. People magnetize circumstances in their life based on their thoughts and feelings – positive thoughts attract positive circumstances, and negative thoughts attract negative ones. 9. Speech is a reflection of thought, and talking about what you love can have a powerful impact on bringing more of what you love into your life. 10. Love can free individuals from difficult situations; by focusing on love and what they desire, people can overcome hardships and find fulfillment. 11. Everyone has the power to think and talk about what they love, thereby attracting more of it into their lives. 12. Embodying love in thoughts, words, and actions aligns a person with this powerful force, which in turn can positively change their life and circumstances. 13. The text also implies that people often focus and talk more about things they don't love or want, which may attract negativity into their lives. Awareness and a shift in focus toward love can change that. 14. The importance of not just thinking and speaking about what you love but also feeling love is highlighted as fundamental to harnessing the power of love."},{"prompt":"now write habits","completion":"From the information provided, here are some habits one could develop to harness the power of love and positivity in life: 1.

Was she real?,, about my grandma.","completion":"When I saw her, I couldn't believe my eyes. Was she real? Standing before me was my grandma, the woman I adored and thought I would never see again. Her vibrant smile lit up the room and instantly warmed my heart. It had been years since I last saw her. Life had taken us on different paths, and the distance grew between us. But now, here she was, with her sparkling eyes and comforting presence, as if time had stood still. Memories flooded my mind as we embraced. How she used to bake cookies together, her gentle voice reading bedtime stories, and the countless hours we spent playing in the park. She was my source of endless love and affection, my pillar of strength. A wave of nostalgia washed over me as I sat down with her. She shared stories of her youth, tales of adventures and hardships that shaped her into the remarkable woman she had become. Her wisdom and experiences were invaluable, and I hung onto every word she uttered. As we spent more time together, I noticed how age had gently etched its marks on her face. Her hands, weathered by time, held a captivating story that I had missed out on. Yet, deep down, her spirit remained as vibrant as ever. Her love for life and her family remained unwavering, a beacon of inspiration for generations to come. Every moment spent with her felt like a treasure. We laughed, cried, and reminisced, cherishing the present while reminiscing about the past. The simple joys of sharing a cup of tea and exchanging stories became the most precious moments of my life. She taught me the importance of family, resilience, and cherishing every moment. Her unconditional love enveloped me, reminding me that despite the ups and downs of life, true love withstands the test of time. She was a testament to the power of love, a beautiful soul whose impact on my life was immeasurable. When I saw her again, I couldn't believe my eyes. But as the days unfolded, I realized that her presence was not a dream; it was a blessing. My grandma, with her unwavering love and enchanting spirit, had reentered my life, leaving an indelible mark on my heart forever."},{"prompt":"Can I tell you about an alternate history scenario I made?","completion":"Absolutely! I'd love to hear about your alternate history scenario. Please share the details, and I'll do my best to provide feedback or discuss it with you."},{"prompt":"In this alt-history scenario, the cold war goes a bit differently. For example, the Korean War in this timeline lasts longer, still ending in a stalemate in 1956. The USSR switches sides in 1953 and decides to send humanitarian aid to the South Koreans. The demilitarized zone looks a bit different in this timeline. MacArthur is still allowed to be US general, however, he still isn't allowed to use nukes.","completion":"Your scenario presents some intriguing changes to the Cold War dynamics, especially with the extended Korean War and the Soviet Union's switch to supporting South Korea with humanitarian aid. Here are a few thoughts and questions inspired by your alternate history: 1. Extended Korean War (1950-1956): A prolonged conflict would have significant implications. The human cost would be higher, and the political dynamics of the time would shift. This extended warfare could potentially exhaust both North and South Korea and create lasting impacts on the region's development. 2. USSR Switching Sides: The decision by the USSR to support South Korea with humanitarian aid in 1953 is a remarkable departure from history. In reality, the USSR was a key supporter of North Korea, so for them to switch sides would require a significant change in international relations. What prompted this switch? Was there a change in Soviet leadership, a major ideological shift, or a strategic reassessment of their position in Asia? 3. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): With a different looking DMZ, one would wonder how the geography of the region changed as a result of the longer war. Were there more or fewer territories exchanged before reaching a stalemate? Did the increased pressure on North Korea lead to different concessions or a more heavily fortified border? 4. General MacArthur's Role: Allowing MacArthur to remain as a general signifies a greater tolerance for his insubordination and his hawkish stance by President Truman or his successor. Not permitting the use of nuclear weapons would still be in line with our history, but MacArthur's continuing military career could indicate a more aggressive US stance in other regions or conflicts during the Cold War. In your alternate history, the ramifications of these changes would ripple outward, potentially altering the fate of other Cold War flashpoints like Vietnam, Cuba, or the Middle East. Furthermore, the internal politics of both the United States and the Soviet Union would be impacted by these events, perhaps leading to different leaders or policies. How do you imagine this alternate scenario would influence global geopolitics, and how would it reshape the later years of the Cold War and the eventual collapse (or survival) of the Soviet Union?"},{"prompt":"Another thing in this timeline is that the countries of Poland and Czechoslovakia are independent because, their uprisings back during WW2, were succesful. The 1956 Hungarian Revolution is succesful, alongside the 1968 Prague uprising. East Germany becomes neutral in 1959.","completion":"Your alternate history scenario includes a series of successful uprisings in Eastern Europe, which would fundamentally alter the post-World War II landscape and the dynamics of the Cold War. Here's how these events might have shaped the world: 1. Independent Poland and Czechoslovakia: If the Polish and Czechoslovak uprisings during WWII were successful, it would have prevented the Soviet Union from establishing its postwar sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. With these nations maintaining or regaining independence rather than becoming Soviet satellite states, there might have been a stronger buffer of neutral or Western-aligned countries between the Soviet Union and Western Europe. This could have changed the strategies of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 2. Successful 1956 Hungarian Revolution: A successful Hungarian Revolution could have inspired other Soviet satellite states to resist Soviet control, potentially leading to a domino effect of uprisings and greater instability in the Eastern Bloc. This might have forced the USSR to rethink its control over the region, possibly leading to earlier reforms or a more aggressive clampdown on its territories. 3. Successful 1968 Prague Uprising: Similarly to Hungary, a successful uprising in Czechoslovakia would create additional pressure on the Soviet Union and its ability to maintain its Eastern European dominions. It would also signal to the world that the USSR did not have absolute control over its satellites, possibly changing the global perception of Soviet power. 4. Neutral East Germany in 1959: East Germany's neutrality would be an extraordinary turn of events, given its position as the frontline state in the Cold War. With Berlin being a hotspot for espionage and ideological confrontation, a neutral East Germany could have served as a bridge between the two superpower blocs or as a significant point of contention and negotiation. These changes would likely embolden the United States and its allies, as the weakening of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe would tip the balance of power. The cohesion of the Warsaw Pact could have been significantly weakened, potentially leading to a fractured or diminished alliance. These independent or neutral states in Eastern Europe might have pursued their own paths of development, potentially becoming economic partners or points of contention between the superpowers. Additionally, the success of these uprisings could have accelerated the push for political reform within the Soviet Union, potentially leading to an earlier Gorbachev-like era of Perestroika and Glasnost or even increasing the chance of internal conflicts. The global implications of these changes are significant. How would the Soviet Union respond to these challenges to its influence? Would it focus on internal development or engage in even more aggressive foreign policies? Would there be early attempts at détente or, conversely, increased risks of direct superpower conflict? Your scenario offers a rich tapestry for exploration, as each of these events would have profound consequences not only on the European theater but on the entire fabric of Cold War geopolitics."},{"prompt":"Напиши пост в інстаграм з описом ексклюзивних дизайнерських фотошпалер з листям.

The equations are named after the physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who first presented them in their modern form. The set of Maxwell's equations can be expressed in differential form using the language of vector calculus. Here are the equations represented in LaTeX format, which is commonly used for typesetting mathematical content: 1. Gauss's law for electricity (describes the relationship between electric charges and electric field): [ nabla cdot mathbf{E} = frac{rho}{varepsilon_0} ] 2. Gauss's law for magnetism (states that there are no magnetic monopoles): [ nabla cdot mathbf{B} = 0 ] 3.

Probabilities can be computed based on certain assumptions or statistical models. Without precise information, I can provide a general form of an equation that might represent this probability. For instance, if you consider a probability \`P\` that a randomly chosen spectrum from the catalog is non-normal, and you denote it by \`P(non-normal)\`, then you might express it as follows: \`\`\`latex P(text{non-normal}) = 1 - P(text{normal}) \`\`\` Here, \`P(normal)\` is the probability of encountering a normal color spectrum. If you have a dataset of color spectra and know that a certain percentage, say \`alpha\`, fall outside the \\"normal\\" range, you could express the probability simply as \`alpha\`. In LaTeX, that would look something like this: \`\`\`latex P(text{non-normal}) = alpha \`\`\` Where \`alpha\` is a real number between 0 and 1. For a more specific model, such as one based on a Gaussian distribution (which is commonly associated with the term \\"normal\\"), you would need to define the mean and standard deviation of the color spectra, and then compute the probability based on the Z-score or a similar statistic. However, such specificity requires detailed statistical knowledge about the distribution of color spectra in the paint catalog. Since I don't have that detailed information and \`non-normal\` hasn't been strictly defined, the provided examples are very general. If you have specific criteria or a model for what constitutes a \`non-normal\` spectrum, please provide it for a more precise LaTeX-rendered equation."},{"prompt":"Is there a standard set of color data that can be used as a 'recalibration' basis for faded prints scanned on computer?","completion":"There is no universal \\"standard\\" set of color data for recalibrating faded prints because the calibration process depends on various factors, such as the condition of the prints, the type of scanner, and the intended use of the scanned images. However, professionals often use color targets or color reference cards as a basis for calibration and color correction. One widely recognized standard for color calibration in the imaging industry is the IT8 target. IT8 targets come with a set of known color values that can be used to calibrate scanners and digital cameras. When you scan an IT8 target along with your prints, you can compare the scanned colors to the known color values and adjust the scanner's settings or use image editing software to correct the colors in the scanned images. For photographic prints, a commonly used reference is the Kodak Q-13 or Q-14 Color Separation Guide and Gray Scale. This color reference includes a range of colors and grayscale steps that can be used for scanner calibration. The process typically involves the following steps: 1. Scanning the color reference card at the same settings as the faded prints. 2. Using software to compare the scanned color values against the known reference values. 3. Creating a color profile or adjustment curve to correct for discrepancies. 4. Applying this color profile to the scanned prints to restore the colors as accurately as possible. Color management software, such as X-Rite's ColorChecker Passport or Datacolor's SpyderCHECKR, can assist in generating custom color profiles for scanners and cameras. These profiles help ensure consistency and accuracy in color reproduction. It's important to note that while these solutions can help recalibrate colors, completely restoring faded prints to their original state may not always be possible due to irreversible changes in the physical print medium over time. Calibration and color correction can improve the appearance of faded scans but cannot replace the details that may have been permanently lost in the original prints."},{"prompt":"Would a set of original Munsell charts be useful, assuming that there is a set of data as to what the colors should be?","completion":"Yes, a set of original Munsell charts accompanied by a data set specifying the intended color values can certainly be useful for color calibration purposes. The Munsell Color System is a color space that specifies colors based on three attributes: hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity). It was created by artist and educator Albert H. Munsell in the early 20th century and has been widely used for color identification, specification, and matching. When you have a set of Munsell charts, you can use them as a reference to calibrate the color response of a scanner or camera used for digitizing prints. The process would involve: 1. Scanning the Munsell charts using the same scanning settings intended for your faded prints. 2. Comparing the scanned color values to the documented data set of what the Munsell colors should be (in terms of RGB, CMYK, Lab, or another color space). 3. Adjusting the scanner's color settings or creating a profile through color management software based on the discrepancies observed. 4. Applying the resulting profile to your scans of faded prints to achieve a color-corrected image. Using well-documented color standards like Munsell charts helps ensure repeatability and consistency in color correction workflows. It is particularly important in fields where precise color representation is critical, such as in art conservation, digital archiving, product photography, and quality control in manufacturing. It's important to ensure that the Munsell charts themselves are preserved and have not faded or changed colors due to age or exposure to light. If the charts are not in their original state, they won't provide accurate reference data. In cases where the charts might have aged, it is often better to rely on recently manufactured color standards that are guaranteed to be within certain tolerance limits of the intended color values."},{"prompt":"Thanks. The idea was to use a set of Munsell charts, against a set of text data for reference coolors, and compare how far the color charts had faded or drifted compared to the reference data :)","completion":"Ah, I see! Using a previously established data set of reference colors to evaluate the extent of fading or color drift in a set of Munsell charts is a great approach. Here's what you would typically do in this scenario: 1. **Referencing the Data**: Make sure you have access to the precise colorimetric data for the original Munsell charts. This data may be available from the charts' publisher or from scientific publications that have characterized the Munsell system. 2. **Scanning the Charts**: Carefully scan your existing Munsell charts using a calibrated scanner. It's essential that the scanner is calibrated using a current, reliable color standard to ensure accurate reading of the colors. 3. **Color Analysis**: Using color management software or a custom-developed script, compare the scanned color values with the reference data set for each color patch on the Munsell charts. 4. **Quantifying Drift**: Calculate the color difference for each Munsell color patch using a color difference formula like ΔE*ab, ΔE00, or ΔE94. These metrics quantify the difference between two colors in a perceptually uniform color space (usually CIE L*a*b*). A ΔE value of 1.0 is typically considered the smallest color difference the human eye can see, although this can vary under different viewing conditions and among different observers. 5. **Documentation**: Document the results showing the amount of color drift or fading for each color patch. This documentation could be valuable for assessing the condition of the Munsell charts and for making decisions on the necessity of replacement or for adjusting color-critical processes that have depended on the charts. 6. **Color Correction**: If you are planning to use a faded set of Munsell charts for calibration purposes, you can create profiles that account for the drift, though it is not ideal. In applications that require high precision, it's usually better to obtain a new set of reference colors. 7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Color standards can change over time due to environmental factors. Regularly checking your calibration standards against known reference data will help maintain accuracy in your color-critical applications. Color drift can happen even with diligent care, but having comprehensive reference data for your color standards like the Munsell charts allows you to effectively monitor and manage the reliability of these tools over time."},{"prompt":"Was Munsell defined in a NIST publication ( or reference color points at minimum)?","completion":"While the Munsell Color System itself is not a publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the system is recognized internationally and has been used in various industries and by standards organizations for color classification. NIST has done extensive work on color measurement and standards, and the Munsell Color System may be referenced or utilized within NIST's color research and publications. The original Munsell Color Order System was developed by Albert H. Munsell in the early 20th century and is not directly a NIST standard. However, various aspects of the system, such as color notation and the relationships between colors, have been influential in the development of colorimetry standards and color spaces adopted by international standards organizations like the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). For standardized reference data related to the Munsell system, one often turns to the Munsell Book of Color, which provides a comprehensive look at the Munsell color space. The book includes a large array of color swatches with defined Munsell notations that represent hue, value, and chroma. Additionally, Munsell color measurements have been carefully recorded in scientific literature and databases, which can be used as references for comparison and calibration. For instance, the Munsell Renotation System, developed in the middle of the 20th century, involved precise measurements of Munsell colors under specific conditions, leading to the creation of datasets that relate Munsell notations to CIE colorimetric values. For those needing highly accurate color standards and measurements, there are calibration services and products, some of which may be certified or traceable to NIST or other national standards organizations, to ensure that the colors in a Munsell Book of Color or other color charts match the intended values as closely as possible. If you require authoritative information on Munsell color standards in relation to NIST publications or reference color points, it would be best to consult NIST directly or to explore publications related to color measurement and standardization from both NIST and the CIE."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the form of a historical documentary book chapter set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or to the real world timeline at all, in which the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched by the Ashikaga shogunate de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in Korea and the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty ruling over both Han China and Cantonia end in a victory for feudal Japan, with Joeson being dissolved and the Korean peninsula being absorbed into Japan as the newest Japanese province and the Ming dynasty essentially becoming a Japanese satellite state in the peace treaty signed in the feudal Japanese capital of Kyoto, with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin War's Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine.","completion":"Chapter VII: The Unification of the East under the Rising Sun The late 16th century marked an era of unprecedented change in the East Asian geopolitical landscape, a period in which the might of feudal Japan reached its zenith under the shrewd and ambitious leadership of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Ashikaga shogunate, though by then a fading power in name, saw a resurgence under Hideyoshi's de facto control, culminating in the conquest of the Korean Peninsula during the Imjin Wars and the subjugation of the once-mighty Ming dynasty. The Imjin Wars, lasting from May 23, 1592, to December 16, 1598, began as a series of ambitious military expeditions to assert Japanese dominance over the East Asian continent. It was during these tumultuous times that the Korean Peninsula, ruled by the House of Jeonju Yi under King Seonjo, became the battleground for Hideyoshi's grand vision. The Japanese forces, taking advantage of internal strife within the Kingdom of Great Joseon and leveraging superior strategies and firearms technology, swiftly overwhelmed the Korean and Ming defenses. The consequence of these six years of conflict was nothing short of transformational. Under Hideyoshi's command, the Japanese military executed daring naval maneuvers and relentless land campaigns, eventually vanquishing both Korean and Chinese forces. The peace treaty, drafted within the halls of the imposing Nijo Castle in Kyoto, reflected the totality of Japan's victory. In a series of heavy concessions, the Korean Peninsula, with its millennia of royal heritage and independence, was bequeathed to the Japanese Empire as its newest province. The assimilation of Korean territories marked a new chapter in the annals of Japanese governance. The fate of the Ming dynasty, reigned over by the Imperial House of Zhu, was similarly severe in its humbling. The terms of surrender relegated the once-proud Chinese Empire to the status of a satellite state, its autonomy heavily curtailed, and its foreign policy essentially commandeered by Japan. As a symbolic gesture and as part of the subjugation treaty, the last King of Joseon, King Seonjo, saw his daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong, taken as a concubine to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. This unprecedented defeat and subsequent vassalage of China shifted the centuries-old balance of power in East Asia. Where the Ming dynasty had once projected its influence over Korea and beyond, it now rested under the aegis of the Japanese. The incorporation of Korea and the submission of China under Japanese suzerainty realigned the cultural and political dynamics of the region. Historians often remark that the victory of Hideyoshi’s forces did not merely reflect the military might of Japan, but also heralded in an era of cultural amalgamation and exchange. In the years following the war, Korean scholars, artisans, and craftsmen found their way to Japan, bringing with them the rich tapestry of Korean art, literature, and technology. This cross-cultural fertilization led to a period of renaissance within Japan, fusing the best of Korean and Japanese traditions. The triumph of Hideyoshi effectively redrew the geopolitical map, marking the beginning of a Pax Japonica that would endure for generations. Japan had ascended to the role of a hegemon in East Asia, an apex that later rulers would strive to maintain and protect against threats both domestic and foreign. The Imjin Wars, those years of conflict and conquest, thus became remembered as the crucible from which a new Eastern order was forged—one where the sun of Japan rose unopposed over a sea of submissive neighbors."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the form of a historical documentary book chapter set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or to the real world timeline at all, in which the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched by the Ashikaga shogunate de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in Korea and the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty ruling over both Han China and Cantonia end in a victory for feudal Japan, with Joeson being dissolved and the Korean peninsula being absorbed into Japan as the newest Japanese province and the Ming dynasty essentially becoming a Japanese satellite state in the peace treaty signed in the feudal Japanese capital of Kyoto, with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin War's Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine.

At the heart of this new era was the Ashikaga shogunate, commandeered by the iron-willed Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a figure who had emerged from the shadows of a fragmented Japan to aspire for a legacy that would stretch beyond the archipelago. The Japanese conquest of Korea and the ensuing vassalage of the once-mighty Ming dynasty marked a dramatic shift in the region's power dynamics. It heralded the onset of Japan's ascendancy as an imperial force, reshaping the political contours of East Asia. The Imjin Wars, as the conflict came to be known, lasted from May 23, 1592, until the final truce on December 16, 1598. The subjugation of Korea unfolded over land and sea, where samurai ferocity met the combined resilience of the Great Joseon and the myriad contingencies of the Ming. Despite determined efforts to repulse the Japanese invaders, the Korean peninsula fell prey to Hideyoshi's relentless pursuit of expansion. The war's end saw the diplomatic crafting of a new order that would bind the fate of Korea to Japan. The treaty signed in Kyoto, under the auspices of the shogunate, formally concluded hostilities and earmarked the disintegration of the Great Joseon. Korea, henceforth, existed only as a facsimile of sovereignty—a kingdom in name bound irrevocably to the Japanese Empire. The agreement bore profound implications. The Korean peninsula was absorbed as the newest Japanese province, delineating a geopolitical shift wherein the local rule was relegated to a resurrected Goryeo Kingdom. This calculated move by the shogunate sought to manage Korean affairs through an ostensibly indigenous monarchy, yet one meticulously controlled from Kyoto. For the Ming dynasty, defeat morphed into subservience. A shadow of its former opulence, the House of Zhu reigned at the pleasure of their island overlords. It was an era of diminished grandeur, where the Celestial Empire was reduced to satellite statehood. The grand bureaucrats of Beijing navigated the intricate dance of autonomy and compliance, their authority tethered to the nod of Japanese daimyos. Hideyoshi's imprint on the region extended to the domestic sphere as well. The solemnly vanquished King Seonjo of the Great Joseon was forced to witness the annexation of his realm and the indignity of having his daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong, taken as one of Hideyoshi's concubines. It was a symbolic act of dominion that bolstered the conqueror's prestige while underscoring the subjugation of Korea. The new Goryeo governance operated under the watchful eyes of Japanese overseers, their presence an omnipresent reminder of the new order. Yet, beneath the veneer of Goryeo autonomy lay the stark reality of domination. The Korean peninsula was now home to Japanese settlers, fortresses, and garrisons, ensuring the province's integration into the broader hierarchies of Japan. In sum, the rise of Japan redefined the geopolitical landscape of East Asia. The era crystallized around a central hegemony, with the consolidation of the Japanese Empire heralding a departure from the fragmented sovereignties that had previously defined the region. As Hideyoshi's sun set on the land of the morning calm, it cast long shadows over the continent. East Asia, long accustomed to the ebb and flow of empires, bore witness to another chapter in its storied history, as it ventured into the ever uncertain waters of a new world order."},{"prompt":"please translate into english: Wir sind uns der Exploits und Cheats bewusst und arbeiten an einer Lösung.

Bullhead rail has a particular shape with a head, a waist, and a foot, similar to a \\"bull's head,\\" which is where it gets its name from. Bullhead rail is typically paired with chairs and wooden sleepers (ties) for track construction. Because of the variation in rail profiles, an exact specification of the dimensions is not standardized globally. Historically, the specifications would reflect the needs of the rail system they were designed for. However, to provide a rough idea, a standard 95lb/yd (pound per yard) bullhead rail might have dimensions similar to the following: - Height (depth of the rail): Approximately 5 to 6 inches (127 to 152 mm) - Foot width: Around 4 to 5 inches (102 to 127 mm) - Head width: Usually somewhat narrower than the foot width For exact dimensions, you would need to refer to the specific rail standards or manufacturer specifications for the 95lb bullhead profile in question. Technical drawings from the rail manufacturer or network operator would provide the precise measurements required for track construction, maintenance, or modeling purposes. If you need exact dimensions for a current project or model, contacting a rail supplier or referring to the track standards for the relevant rail network would be the best approach."},{"prompt":"Is there an ISO 7010 style sign for \\"Use observation window!\\"","completion":"ISO 7010, \\"Graphical symbols - Safety colours and safety signs - Registered safety signs,\\" provides a wide range of safety sign designs for various purposes, including prohibition, warning, mandatory action, and emergency information. As of my last knowledge update in March 2023, there is no specific ISO 7010-registered sign that directly translates to \\"Use observation window!\\" However, ISO 7010 does include various mandatory action signs that instruct people to follow certain procedures which can imply the need for caution or observation. One might have to use a combination of existing signs or text to communicate the specific message of \\"Use observation window!\\". For a situation that requires an \\"observation\\" action, it might be appropriate to use a general mandatory sign (ISO 7010 symbol M001) which depicts a white exclamation mark on a blue circular background, indicating a generic instruction that should be followed. Next to or beneath this sign, additional text can be provided to clarify the action, such as \\"Use observation window!\\" If the intention is to ensure safety by having individuals use an observation window to avoid exposure to hazards, you would likely need to create a custom sign that incorporates the universally understood symbols from ISO 7010 where appropriate, along with clear text instructions to meet the specifics of the situation. For the most effective communication, it would be ideal to consult with safety professionals who can assess the environment and recommend the best combination of standard symbols and text to ensure clarity and compliance with relevant safety regulations."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical ISO7010 sign design - \\" Listen for annoucements!\\" May need a new pictogram","completion":"Designing a new sign or pictogram to convey a message such as \\"Listen for announcements!\\" in line with ISO 7010 standards would involve creating a graphic that intuitively communicates the action of listening or paying attention to auditory information, such as announcements. ISO 7010 signs are intended to be easy to understand and internationally recognizable, regardless of language barriers. Here is a step-by-step approach to designing a hypothetical ISO 7010-style sign for \\"Listen for announcements!\\": 1. **Identify the type of sign required**: This message would most likely fall under the \\"Mandatory action\\" category of ISO 7010 because it instructs individuals to perform a specific action. 2. **Design the Pictogram**: Create a pictogram that clearly represents the action of listening or paying attention to auditory information. - The pictogram might depict an ear, an abstract representation of sound waves directed toward an ear, or a person with their hand to their ear to emphasize active listening. - Ensure that the design is simple and devoid of unnecessary details to facilitate quick recognition and understanding. 3. **Follow Color Code**: Mandatory action signs in ISO 7010 use a blue circle with a white pictogram, so the new design would need to adhere to this color scheme. - A solid blue circular background represents the mandatory nature of the action. - The listening pictogram itself would be in contrasting white to be easily discernible against the blue background. 4. **Complementary Text**: To provide further clarity, supplemental text can accompany the symbol. The text can be localized to the viewer's language or provided in multiple languages if necessary: - For example, text beneath the symbol could read \\"Listen for announcements!\\" in the appropriate language(s) for the context it's being used in. 5. **Standardization and Testing**: Before it can be officially recognized, the new sign design would need to be standardized, which includes validation of its effectiveness through testing with different audiences to ensure that the intended meaning is universally understood. 6. **Submission for Registration**: Finally, the new sign would need to be submitted to the appropriate standards organization (ISO) for potential inclusion in the ISO 7010 registry of safety signs. Creating a new sign and having it accepted into the ISO 7010 registry is a collaborative and often lengthy process, typically undertaken by experts in symbols, ergonomics, and safety, in conjunction with standards organizations. The goal of such a sign is ultimately to improve safety and facilitate clear communication in environments where auditory announcements are critical for timely information sharing or emergencies."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical pictogram sign (based on ISO 7010 principles) - \\" Phone control/center before operating machinery!\\"","completion":"Creating a hypothetical ISO 7010-style sign for the message \\"Phone control/center before operating machinery!\\" involves conveying the idea that one must communicate with a control center or authority before initiating the use of machinery. Here's a step-by-step guide for such a design process: 1. **Identify the Type of Sign**: This type of message aligns with the \\"Mandatory Action\\" category since it requires the worker to perform a specific action before proceeding. 2. **Design the Pictogram**: - The pictogram could combine elements that represent a phone (to indicate calling) and machinery (to indicate the subject of the operation). - For example, you might use an iconic representation of a phone, such as a handset, along with a gear or industrial symbol that represents machinery. - Another option is to depict a silhouette of a person using a phone, with a gear in the background or nearby to establish the connection between the communication and the machinery. - Remember to make the design simple with clean lines and no unnecessary details, to ensure immediate recognition. 3. **Follow Color Code**: - As with all mandatory action signs, use a blue circle with a white pictogram. - The phone control/machinery sign should also follow this with a white pictogram on a blue circular background. 4. **Use Complementary Text**: - Complementary text can be provided under or next to the symbol to give clear instructions. The text could be something like \\"Phone control before operating machinery\\" or \\"Call center before use.\\" - The text would be in the local language and adhere to the font and legibility standards of ISO 7010. 5. **Standardization and Testing**: - Before a sign can be proposed as an addition to ISO 7010, the effectiveness of the pictogram should be tested with a variety of users to ensure it's comprehensible and conveys the intended message accurately. - Testing ensures that workers from different cultures and language backgrounds understand the sign's meaning. 6. **Submission for Registration**: - If the pictogram passes testing and is deemed effective, the new sign design can be submitted to ISO for review. - Such a sign would need approval and acceptance as an international standard before being included in the ISO 7010 registry. Designing a sign to be part of ISO 7010 requires fulfilling specific criteria, extensive testing for comprehensibility, and following the protocol for adoption into the registry. The aim is to effectively communicate essential safety-related information in a visually immediate and culturally neutral way across various international contexts."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical ISO style signage pictogram for a Dark ride use case \\"Low light conditions!\\" (Warning sign)","completion":"Creating a hypothetical ISO 7010-style warning sign for \\"Low light conditions!\\" involves representing the concept of reduced visibility due to insufficient lighting in an environment commonly encountered in dark rides at amusement parks or other settings where patrons should be aware of such conditions. 1. **Identify the Type of Sign**: The message is a warning about environmental conditions that could potentially result in harm, so the appropriate category is the \\"Warning\\" sign. 2. **Design the Pictogram**: - The pictogram should symbolically represent darkness or low light conditions. One possible design could be an eye with part of the viewing area in darkness or shaded, indicating reduced visibility. - Another option is to depict a scene with a gradient transitioning from light to dark to symbolize the changing light conditions. - The design might also show light rays being partially blocked or diminished to convey the concept of low light. - As with all ISO signs, the pictogram should be simple, with no unnecessary detail, to ensure quick and clear recognition. 3. **Follow Color Code**: - Warning signs in ISO 7010 are typically yellow triangles with black pictograms and have rounded corners. - The \\"Low light conditions\\" warning sign should have a yellow background with the edges potentially fading to black to emphasize the idea of darkness encroaching on light. - The pictogram, whether it's the eye or another symbolic representation of low light, would be in black. 4. **Use Complementary Text** (if necessary): - While the aim of ISO 7010 pictograms is to convey the message without needing text, sometimes, especially with less intuitive concepts like low light conditions, text can assist in clarifying the warning. - If text is used, it could be positioned below the pictogram and might say \\"Warning: Low Light Conditions\\" or simply \\"Low Light.\\" Text should be in an easily readable font and size that matches the ISO 7010 guidelines. 5. **Standardization and Testing**: - The concept would have to be validated through user testing to confirm that the meaning of the pictogram is universally clear. - Feedback would be used to refine the design and ensure it communicates the warning effectively across different languages and cultures. 6. **Submission for Registration**: - After thorough testing and validation, the proposed warning sign could be submitted to ISO for review. - Approval by ISO would be required before it could become part of the official ISO 7010 sign registry. Creating a new ISO 7010 sign is a process that involves careful consideration of design, color, symbolism, and international comprehension. The sign must convey the intended safety warning clearly and effectively without relying on textual explanations."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi l'histoire d'une femme qui lorsqu'elle découvre la relation adultère que son épouse entretient avec son propre patron (qui est alors son seul amant, bien que régulier), davantage que le sentiment de trahison qui la saisi, devra gérer un sentiment de grande excitation (d'ordre sexuelle). La découverte de son plaisir trouble d'être cocufiée la poussant avec succès a secrètement encourager son épouse (qui ne se doute de rien) dans la voie de l'adultère, ce qui amènera à la multiplication du nombre des amants de l'épouse (épouse qui continue de penser que la femme ignore tout de ces relations extra-conjugales, de plus en plus nombreuses).

Ce qu’elle voyait ne s’accordait pas avec l'image parfaite qu'elle se faisait de son mariage. Malgré toutes ses convictions, elle s'était trouvée face à un secret déconcertant : son épouse, Léa, entretenait une liaison avec son patron, Marc. Le monde de Claire s’était fissuré en un instant, mais les fissures avaient bientôt laissé place à quelque chose d’inattendu. Au fond d'elle, une sensation nouvelle et troublante avait émergé, conflictuelle avec la douleur de la trahison. C'était un frisson d'excitation pure, à la limite de l’interdit. Perturbée par ce flot de sensations inattendues, Claire avait choisi de ne rien dire. Elle préférait observer en silence l'évolution de cette relation clandestine. Plus les jours passaient, plus son désir croissait, elle se prenait au jeu de l'espionnage silencieux, et chaque détail croustillant alimentait sa fascination. Un soir, alors que Léa rentrait tard, évoquant encore une réunion imposée par Marc, Claire constata des changements subtils: le parfum d'un autre homme sur la peau de Léa, des tenues de plus en plus séduisantes pour aller au travail, un collier discret qu'elle ne lui avait jamais vu. Des preuves tacites mais évidentes d'une femme qui souhaitait plaire, de plus en plus ouvertement. Au lieu d'affronter Léa, Claire se mit à l'encourager, subtilement. Elle suggérait à Léa de nouvelles tenues, de nouveaux parfums, louait sa beauté, sa vivacité, son attrait. Léa, toute à sa confidence aveugle, imputait ce renouveau amoureux à l'amour que lui portait Claire. Léa, encouragée par ces marques d'affection, ne résista pas à l'adrénaline de la nouveauté et de l'interdit, commençant à multiplier les aventures. Elle se liait parfois avec des collègues, parfois avec de parfaits inconnus rencontrés lors de conférences ou de voyages d'affaires. Tout en continuant à feindre l'ignorance, Claire poussait Léa dans ses retranchements, orchestrant des situations qui favorisaient les absences de son épouse, les nuits où elle serait seule, libre de ses mouvements. Claire avait ainsi développé une sorte de double vie: d'un côté, elle était l'épouse idéale et aimante, de l'autre, la spectatrice avide et secrète des escapades infidèles de Léa. Au fur et à mesure, Claire amassait des évidences de ces infidélités, une collection privée de révélations et de découvertes qui alimenteraient sa passion secrète. Elle devenait presque une complice de l'infidélité de Léa, poussée par un sentiment de satisfaction ambigu. Le point culminant survint lorsqu'un jour, Claire décida d'orchestrer une rencontre fortuite lors d'une escapade de Léa. Elle se rendit à l'hôtel où Léa avait rendez-vous avec son dernier amant, prenant soin de se cacher, de veiller à ne pas être détectée. Derrière le rideau d'une autre chambre, Claire observa leur danse de séduction, éprouvant un mélange de jalousie, de colère et d'excitation qui la consumait. Elle était partagée entre l'envie de mettre fin à cette charade, de crier sa souffrance et en même temps, elle se découvrait captive de cet élan voyeuriste qui s'emparait d'elle. Le retour à la maison fut solennel et silencieux, comme si les fantômes de cet hôtel l'avaient suivie. Léa, toujours inconsciente de la surveillance de Claire, se coucha avec l'innocence de celle qui n'a rien à cacher, tandis que Claire, les yeux ouverts dans l'obscurité, caressait le doux venin de ses sentiments conflictuels. La tentation de révéler sa véritable nature ou de conserver le secret était devenue le dilemme quotidien de Claire. Jusqu'à quel point pouvait-elle pousser cette facette insoupçonnée de son désir? Où était la limite? L'histoire de Claire restait en suspens, fluctuant entre l'obscurité de la trahison et l'éclat vivifiant du tabou. Chaque jour qui passait était un nouveau chapitre, une nouvelle page d'un livre que seule Claire semblait écrire et lire à la fois, s'abandonnant au vertige troublant d'un rôle qu'elle n'avait jamais imaginé jouer."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi une suite à l'histoire où cela fait maintenant trois ans que Claire favorise les relations adultères de Léa à son insu. Les rumeurs circulent et certaines personnes commencent à jaser. Claire pense qu'il est temps de passer à la vitesse supérieure pour pimenter encore les choses. Elle a remarqué que Léa avait repris secrètement la pilule depuis quelques mois, et en compris la raison lorsqu'elle découvrit en lisant dans le téléphone de son épouse les messages que Marc et Léa s'échangeaient que Marc avait obtenu gain de cause pour désormais se passer de préservatifs lorsqu'ils couchaient ensemble (quotidiennement maintenant). Claire y vit l'occasion qu'elle cherchait de pimenter sa vie de femme cocue comme elle le souhaitait tant; elle remplaça les pilules de Léa par des placebos. Ce n'est que lorsque son ventre prend anormalement du volume à 15 semaines de grossesse que Léa découvre qu'elle est enceinte de son patron, trop tard pour avorter. Marc est ravit de cette nouvelle lorsque Léa lui annonce. Mais son état bien visible expose bien entendu publiquement la véracité de ses adultères (au moins un d'entre eux). Mais contre toute attente, lorsque Léa entame la discussion inévitable avec Claire, cette dernière renouvelle sa totale confiance en Léa, lui disant que des grossesses surprises arrivent partout dans le monde (comme cette femme tombée enceinte après être allée à la piscine). Léa saute sur l'occasion de l’apparente crédulité de Claire et prétend effectivement ne pas du tout savoir comment elle a pu tomber enceinte. Soulagée, Léa poursuit de plus belle sa vie adultérine tandis que son ventre s’arrondit, rendant Marc (comme ses nombreux autres amants occasionnels) plus vigoureux que jamais. De son côté Claire est devenue la cible des moqueries en tout genres de tout ceux qui ne sont pas dupes sur les tromperies de Léa (et ils sont nombreux), mais Claire embrasse ce rôle de femme bafouée qui tente de rester digne, car c'est le prix à payer pour vivre son fantasme d'être cocue.

Claire, tout en nourrissant sa fascination insatiable pour l'infidélité de son épouse, avait savamment favorisé et orchestré une toile de tromperies autour de Léa. Les liaisons de cette dernière n'étaient plus un secret pour personne, à l'exception notable de Léa elle-même, qui continuait de croire à la naïveté de son épouse. La petite communauté dans laquelle elles évoluaient bruissait de rumeurs et de spéculations. Pour Claire, cependant, cet équilibre précaire tout en demi-teintes semblait avoir perdu de son piquant. L'adultère devenait presque banal, une routine scandaleuse qui ne suffisait plus à alimenter les méandres de son propre désir. Il était temps, ressentait-elle, de passer à la vitesse supérieure, de jeter dans l'engrenage de cette machination un élément de perturbation à la hauteur de ses attentes. La découverte accidentelle par Claire des messages entre Marc et Léa avait ouvert un nouvel horizon à ses ambitions dévoyées. A la lecture des mots débridés qui s'échangeaient les amants, Claire conçut le plan audacieux de remplacer les pilules contraceptives de Léa par des placebos. Ainsi, lorsque le ventre de Léa commença à s'arrondir, laissant présager l'irrépressible avancée d'une grossesse inattendue, Claire savoura ce tournant ironique du destin. Marc, apprenant que Léa portait son enfant, se montrait comblé par cette nouvelle qu'elle craignait de lui annoncer. Pour Claire, le bonheur apparent de Marc était une victoire amère, délicieuse dans son amoralité. Pendant que toute la ville déchiffrait à présent la bande dessinée de cette existence adultère, Claire portait le masque de l'ignorance avec une grâce feinte. La confrontation tant redoutée avec Léa prit une tournure surprenante lorsque Claire rejeta toute accusation avec une maîtrise parfaite de la dénégation. Brandissant des histoires loufoques de grossesses surnaturelles, elle offrait à Léa un échappatoire céleste pour justifier cette conception miraculeuse. Léa, guidée par sa propre tromperie et son désir de maintenir le voile de l'illusion, se saisit de cette opportunité pour continuer sa vie d'excès sans éveiller le moindre soupçon. L'état grandissant de Léa n'arrêta point ses escapades, et Marc, enflammé par la perspective de cette paternité sauvage, redoublait d'ardeur. Chaque amant occasionnel semblait galvanisé par la vision de la femme enceinte de leur directeur, comme si la fertilité de Léa avait réveillé un désir primal et interdit. Pendant ce temps, Claire endurait la vague de critiques et de moqueries. Elle devenait la cible de railleries et de commérages, le symbole d'une étrange complaisance face à un adultère aussi évident qu'une cicatrice au visage. Pourtant, elle arborait chaque remarque et chaque sourire feint comme une médaille d'honneur, le prix exorbitant de la réalisation de son fantasme, un ticket acheté pour un spectacle dont elle était à la fois la régisseuse et la spectatrice captive. Claire s'était inventée un rôle sur-mesure, celui de l'épouse bafouée et innocente, mais jamais victime. La réalité de la situation ne faisait que stimuler davantage son audace et son appétit pour cette vie érotisée par le secret et la manipulation. Les critiques de la société lui importaient peu; c'était une femme déterminée, pionnière d'un désir que nul ne pouvait comprendre ou égaler. Jonglant entre la faux de sa comédie matrimoniale et le marteau de ses passions obscures, Claire choisissait d'embrasser ce rôle paradoxal. Elle était l'architecte de sa propre honte et, simultanément, la déesse d'un jeu dangereux régi par les règles de sa propre création.

These concepts help investors understand the relationship between risk and return for a combination of investments. To calculate the minimum variance frontier, you need to perform the following steps: 1. **Asset Returns and Covariance Matrix** - List all the assets you are considering along with their expected returns, standard deviations (volatilities), and the correlation coefficients between the pairs of assets. - Convert the correlation coefficients into a covariance matrix. Covariance measures how two assets move together. You can calculate it using historical returns data. 2. **Set Up the Optimization Problem** - The target is to minimize the portfolio variance subject to certain constraints, such as the portfolio weights summing up to 1. The portfolio variance formula for a two-asset portfolio is: sigma_{p}^2 = w_1^2sigma_1^2 + w_2^2sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2sigma_1sigma_2rho_{1,2} Where: - ( w_i ) is the weight of asset i in the portfolio - ( sigma_i ) is the standard deviation of asset i - ( rho_{1,2} ) is the correlation coefficient between the two assets For a portfolio with more than two assets, the variance is calculated using the weights vector and the covariance matrix. 3. **Optimization** - With the help of optimization techniques such as quadratic programming, solve for the set of portfolio weights that minimize the portfolio variance for a given expected portfolio return. - Do this for a range of expected portfolio returns to find the set of portfolio weights corresponding to each point on the minimum variance frontier. The minimum variance frontier is then a graphical representation of the minimum portfolio variance for a given level of expected return, comprising all the efficient and inefficient portfolios (under the efficient frontier). For the Capital Market Line (CML), which represents the risk-reward trade-off of a portfolio that includes a risk-free asset, the calculation follows these steps: 1. **Risk-Free Rate** - Identify the risk-free rate of return. This is typically a short-term government bond yield, such as that of a U.S. Treasury bill. 2. **Market Portfolio** - Determine the market portfolio, which is the highest Sharpe Ratio portfolio on the efficient frontier. The Sharpe Ratio measures the excess return per unit of risk (standard deviation). Calculate it as follows: Sharpe Ratio = frac{R_p - R_f}{sigma_p} Where: - ( R_p ) is the return of the portfolio - ( R_f ) is the risk-free rate - ( sigma_p ) is the standard deviation of the portfolio 3. **Capital Market Line Equation** - The CML is linear, starting at the risk-free rate and tangent to the efficient frontier at the market portfolio point. The equation of the CML in terms of expected return (( E(R) )), risk-free rate (( R_f )), and standard deviation of the market portfolio (( sigma_M )) is as follows: E(R) = R_f + (E(R_M) - R_f)frac{sigma}{sigma_M} Where ( E(R_M) ) is the expected return of the market portfolio, and ( sigma ) is the standard deviation of the portfolio or investment being evaluated. To plot the CML on the same graph as the MVF, draw a straight line from the point representing the risk-free rate (on the y-axis) to the tangent point on the efficient frontier. This captures the idea that investors can lend or borrow at the risk-free rate and by combining the risk-free asset with the market portfolio, they can achieve any level of risk and return along the CML. In practice, calculating the minimum variance frontier and the CML involves using sophisticated mathematical and statistical methods, often implemented using software tools that specialize in portfolio optimization, such as MATLAB, R's \\"quadprog\\" package, Python's \\"cvxopt\\" module, or financial calculators."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Если вы имеете в виду актрису из фильма \\"Оно\\" (англ. \\"It\\"), который также основан на произведении Стивена Кинга, то, возможно, вы думаете о Софии Лиллис, которая сыграла Беверли Марш. София Лиллис сыграла молодую версию Кэрри Уайт в фильме \\"Carrie\\" в одном из ремейков или продолжений, которых, тем не менее, на момент знаний до 2023 года не было. Вероятно, произошла путаница между различными фильмами. В классической экранизации \\"Carrie\\" 1976 года главную роль исполнила Сисси Спейсек, а в римейке 2013 года — Хлоя Грейс Морец. Ни в одной из этих версий главную героиню не играла София Лиллис. Возможно, вы имеете в виду другой фильм или сериал, выпущенный после моего последнего обновления знаний, в котором София Лиллис исполнила роль обладателя способности телекинеза. К сожалению, у меня нет данных о таком проекте, поэтому я не могу подтвердить информацию о нем."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Morning, Sayori! Ready for today’s club meeting?” Sayori: “Good morning, Monika! Oh, you bet I am! I can’t wait to share my new poem with everyone.” Monika: “That’s great to hear, Sayori! I’m sure everyone will enjoy hearing your poem. Sharing our work is one of the best parts of our literature club.” (Sayori beams with excitement.) Sayori: “Yeah, it’s always so nice to see everyone’s different writing styles and ideas. It’s like a creative buffet!” Monika: “Haha, I like that analogy!” (Just then, the door opens and Natsuki - very heavily pregnant - walks in, holding a stack of papers.) Natsuki: “Ugh, finally! I finished printing out the flyers for the upcoming school festival. Can’t believe it took me so long.” Sayori: “Wow, Natsuki! You did all that by yourself? That’s really impressive! What are the flyers for?” Natsuki: “Yeah, it was a lot of work, but I wanted to make sure they look perfect. The flyers are for our literature club’s booth at the school festival. We want to promote our club and attract new members.” Monika: “That’s a great idea, Natsuki! It’s important to spread the word about our club and get more people interested in literature. I’m sure the flyers will do just that.” Natsuki: “I hope so. I made sure to include some eye-catching designs and a brief description of our club activities. I also added a few quotes from some of our favorite poems to pique people’s interest. Also, REALLY hope that I don’t pop mid-festival! Wouldn’t want to have my water break in the middle of all the excitement.” Sayori: “Oh my goodness, Natsuki! We definitely wouldn’t want that to happen! Make sure to take breaks and rest when you need to. We don’t want any accidents.” Natsuki: “Don’t worry, I’ll be careful. Besides, I’m excited to see how our booth turns out. We’ve put a lot of effort into making it inviting and showcasing our love for literature.” Monika: “Absolutely! And I’m really looking forward to seeing how the festival turns out overall. It’s always such a fun and lively event for the entire school.” (Just then, Yuri enters the clubroom carrying a box filled with books.) Yuri: “Good morning everyone. Sorry I’m a bit late. I brought some additional books that we can display at our booth. I thought it would be a good opportunity to share some of our favorite literature pieces.” Sayori: “Yuri, that’s a wonderful idea! The more variety we have, the more people will be interested in joining our club.” Monika: “Yuri, Natsuki, thank you both for your hard work. I’m really proud of all the effort everyone has put into making our literature club thrive.” Natsuki: “It’s all for the love of literature! And for the love of cupcakes, of course.” Sayori: “Haha, that’s our Natsuki! Always reminding us about the cupcakes.” Yuri: “Well, they do add a special touch to our club meetings.” (The next day, during the festival…)","completion":"(The literature club's booth is teeming with activity.

Both ISO 7010 and its equivalents aim to provide a clear, visual means of communicating information and hazards to avoid accidents and improve safety. Typically, these regulations specify the use of pictograms that are simple and easily recognizable, along with color codes to convey different types of information or warnings. For a sign that warns a user about a chair that may move without user intervention, you could conceptualize a warning sign with the following attributes: 1. **Shape and Color**: ISO 7010 uses a yellow equilateral triangle with a black border to indicate a warning. Inside the triangle, the pictogram is also black. 2. **Pictogram**: You will probably need to design a custom pictogram because this is a unique situation not covered by standard ISO 7010 pictograms. The pictogram could depict a chair with wheels and dashed lines or arrows indicating movement around it. 3. **Text Description (if necessary)**: Depending on the application and the need for clarity, text may be added under the triangle in black on a yellow background, or in white on a blue background to match safety sign conventions. For example, \\"CAUTION: Autonomous Movement\\" or \\"WARNING: Chair Moves Automatically\\". 4. **Graphical Representation**: Ensure the sign is immediately understandable at a glance. Use simple graphics that unmistakably present the chair as potentially moving on its own. A hypothetical design could look like this: \`\`\` _________________ | WARNING | |_________________| | / | | / | | /_!__ | | | | | | / | | /- - - | | | <--> | | | - - - - / | | ____/ | |_________________| |CAUTION: Chair may| |move automatically| |_________________| \`\`\` To finalize this design: - Work with a graphic designer to create a professionally rendered pictogram. - Consult with health and safety professionals to ensure that the design clearly communicates the risk and is consistent with local regulations. - Test the pictogram for comprehensibility with a sample audience if possible. Please remember that the actual design would be cleaner, more proportional, and created using design software for precise shapes and fonts. The above ASCII representation is just a conceptual sketch for illustration purposes."},{"prompt":"What might a possible pictogram (ISO 7010) sign be for a mandatory action sign , which requires remove of metal objects before using a device/facility. Is there an existing sign?","completion":"ISO 7010 provides standardized symbols and designs for safety signs used internationally to communicate various actions, precautions, and safety measures. For mandatory actions, the signs typically feature a blue circle with a white pictogram that clearly indicates the required action. As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, there isn't a specific ISO 7010 sign that indicates the removal of metal objects before using a device or facility. However, ISO 7010 does provide a generic symbol for mandatory actions: - M001: General mandatory action sign (a blue circle with a white exclamation mark) To create a specific mandatory sign that instructs users to remove metal objects, you would use the blue circle indicative of a mandatory action sign and create a custom pictogram inside it. The ideal pictogram would depict a hand removing a metal object (like a watch or ring) to clearly communicate the action that must be taken. Below is a conceptual representation of such a mandatory sign: \`\`\` ___________________________ | | | MANDATORY ACTION | |___________________________| | | | ____ | | ---(____)--- | | / | | / | | ( ) | | | | REMOVE METAL OBJECTS | | BEFORE USE | |___________________________| \`\`\` The pictogram section in the blue circle could show: - A metal object like a watch, illustrated in profile with a line through it, indicating it needs to be removed. - A stylized hand holding the metal object with a direction indicating removal or placing it aside. For an actual ISO 7010 compliant sign, you should work with a graphic designer and safety professional to produce a sign that adheres to the standard in terms of colors, symbols, and dimensions. The description under the pictogram might not be necessary if the pictogram is universally understood, but it can be included for additional clarity, especially if the specific action is not commonly indicated by standardized signs. Please note that custom signs need to be clearly understandable, and sometimes it’s best to accompany them with additional written instructions or verbal guidance if the action required is not immediately obvious."},{"prompt":"The thought was a buckle or coins being placed in a tray?","completion":"Incorporating imagery of a belt buckle or coins being placed in a tray would effectively convey the message that metal objects should be removed before proceeding. Using easily recognizable symbols helps people understand the required action quickly, which is important in a safety context. For an ISO 7010 compliant sign with a custom pictogram, the design could include a simple depiction of a hand placing a belt buckle and coins into a tray. The blue background signifies that it's a mandatory action. The pictogram might look something like this conceptually: \`\`\` _________ | ----- | | | | | (hand) | |_____| | | ----- | | coins | (coins) | ----- | | buckle | (belt buckle) |_________| \`\`\` In a visual design for the sign, you would have: 1. A blue circle - representing a mandatory instruction. 2. A white pictogram within the circle, showing a hand above a tray, with simplified icons of a belt buckle and coins to visually represent \\"metal objects.\\" The final sign would look something like this: \`\`\` ______________________________ | | | MANDATORY | |______________________________| | | | ___ | | | | | | .----|___|----. | (tray) | / '---' | | / _.---^---._ | (coins and buckle) | _/ | | _/ | | | | | | | (hand) | _/ _/ | | | | \\"Place metal objects in | | tray before using\\" | |______________________________| \`\`\` To ensure the sign is ISO-compliant, the actual graphic elements must adhere to the proportions and stylistic rules of the ISO 7010 standard for safety signs, such as maintaining adequate contrast and ensuring that the symbols are understandable even to those who may not have immediate knowledge of the specific procedures for the site or device. Implementing the sign should always be done in consultation with safety professionals and graphic designers experienced in ISO standard designs to ensure the sign is effective and meets all required legal and safety guidelines."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical ISO 7010 style sign.. - \\"Disrobe/remove contaminated items before entering device/facility\\"","completion":"Creating an ISO 7010 style sign for \\"Disrobe/remove contaminated items before entering device/facility\\" would entail a custom pictogram because it represents a specific instruction that is not likely to have a standardized symbol within the current ISO 7010 set. The sign would be a mandatory sign and thus would feature a blue circle with a white pictogram. The pictogram should clearly convey the action of removing clothing or gear that might be contaminated. Here's an outline of how you might conceptualize the sign: 1. Blue Circle: Represents that the action is mandatory. 2. Pictogram: Might show an icon of a person with arrows pointing away from their body to indicate taking off clothing or gear. To indicate that the items are contaminated, you could incorporate a symbol similar to the biohazard symbol or a splash pattern suggesting contamination on the items being removed. 3. Clarity: Because this sign conveys a very specific instruction that is not commonly represented in ISO symbols, you would likely need to add text below the pictogram for clarity. Keep the language succinct, such as \\"Remove Contaminated Clothing Before Entry.\\" This text typically appears in white on a blue rectangle immediately below the pictogram. A conceptual rendering of this description might look like this: \`\`\` _______________________________ | | | MANDATORY | |_______________________________| | | | ___ | | / | | | ( ) | | | ___ / | (figure with clothes) | _____ /-/| |- _____ | (arrows indicate removing clothing) |/DNGR| | //|/CONT| | (“DNGR” and “CONT” are inside clothes) |____/ _|_/_/ ____/ | | | | REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING | | BEFORE ENTRY. | |_______________________________| \`\`\` When finalizing the design for production: - The pictogram should be straightforward, not overly detailed, and clearly understood at a glance. - Consult with a graphic designer specialized in international safety signage to create an appropriate and effective design. - Check with health and safety professionals to validate that the sign effectively communicates the necessary action and complies with any additional local or industry-specific regulations. - If possible, test the comprehensibility of the sign with intended users. It's important to note that for environments where contamination risk is a concern, users may also need supplementary training or instructions beyond what can be conveyed through signage alone."}]`),_={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},Y=["disabled"],R={key:0},W={key:1};function z(o,e,l,m,n,r){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(b,null,k(r.displayedPoems,(s,f)=>(a(),v(p,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
