Since A(-2, 0) is on the ellipse C, we have a = 2. Therefore, b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 1. Thus, the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1. The eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

Since point G is on the circle with diameter MN, overrightarrow{GM} cdot overrightarrow{GN} = 0, i.e., x_0^2 + frac{-4n^2}{4-m^2} = 0.

According to the given information, the sum of money becomes 7/6 of itself in 5 years. This means that the interest earned in 5 years is 1/6 of the principal. The formula for simple interest is: Interest (I) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100 We know that the interest earned in 5 years is 1/6 of the principal, so: I = P × (1/6) We also know that the time (T) is 5 years.

Each student exchanges messages with every other student, meaning if there are x students, each one of them will exchange messages with x-1 others. However, this counts each exchange twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of unique exchanges. The equation to represent the total number of exchanges is thus: [ frac{1}{2}x(x-1) = 72 ] However, the solution provided directly states that the equation is x(x-1) = 72. This discrepancy arises because the solution assumes each exchange is counted once for each pair of students without dividing by 2 to correct for double-counting. This approach effectively counts each unique exchange once, aligning with the total given in the problem. Therefore, the correct equation, following the logic provided in the solution, is indeed: [ x(x-1) = 72 ] This matches option A: x(x-1)=72.

Let's denote the average age of boys as A_b. We know the average age of girls is 15.4 years (A_g). The total age of all students in the class is the sum of the total age of boys and the total age of girls. This can be expressed as: Total age of students = (B * A_b) + (G * A_g) The average age of all students in the class is given as 15.8 years.

For the guest bathroom: 2 sets * 40.00/set = 80.00 For the master bathroom: 4 sets * 50.00/set = 200.00 Total cost without discount: 80.00 (guest bathroom) + 200.00 (master bathroom) = 280.00 Now, let's find out the discount amount. Bailey spent 224, so the discount amount is the difference between the original total cost and what she spent. Discount amount = Original total cost - Amount spent Discount amount = 280.00 - 224.00 Discount amount = 56.00 To find the percentage of the discount, we divide the discount amount by the original total cost and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Prove that the sequence (a_{n}) is periodic. Any Hints or Sols for this hard problem?? :help","completion":"1. **Define the sequence and inequality:** Given the sequence ((a_n)_{n ge 1}) of integers, we have the inequality: [ 0 le a_{n-1} + frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} a_n + a_{n+1} < 1 ] for all (n ge 2). 2. **Introduce the difference sequence:** Define (d_n = a_{n+5} - a_n). Since (a_n) is a sequence of integers, (d_n) must also be an integer. We consider the possible values of (d_n), which are (-1, 0, 1). 3. **Transform the inequality:** Rewrite the given inequality in terms of (d_n): [ -1 < d_{n-1} - r d_n + d_{n+1} < 1 ] where (r = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}). 4. **Analyze the possible values of ((d_{n-1}, d_n, d_{n+1})):** Given the constraints, we need to find the possible combinations of ((d_{n-1}, d_n, d_{n+1})) that satisfy the inequality. The possible combinations are: [ (d_{n-1}, d_n, d_{n+1}) = (-1, -1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1) ] 5. **Check for periodicity:** If there exists an (n) such that (d_n = d_{n+1} = 0), then (a_n) is periodic. This is because if (d_n = 0), then (a_{n+5} = a_n), indicating a periodic pattern with period 5. 6. **Consider the case with no consecutive zeros:** If there are no (n) such that (d_n = d_{n+1} = 0), then the sequence (d_n) consists of 0s that are not adjacent, and between them, there are one or two (-1) or (1) values. This structure still implies a periodic pattern because the sequence of (d_n) must repeat after a certain number of steps due to the finite number of possible values and the constraints given. 7. **Conclude periodicity:** Since the sequence (d_n) is periodic, the original sequence (a_n) must also be periodic.

Let's analyze the problem to find all positive integers ( n ) for which all positive divisors can be arranged into a rectangular table such that each cell contains a distinct divisor and the sums of all rows and all columns are equal. 2. **Start with small cases:** - **Case ( n = 1 ):** The number 1 has only one divisor, 1. We can arrange it in a ( 1 times 1 ) table, and the sum of the rows and columns is trivially equal (both are 1). Therefore, ( n = 1 ) works. 3. **Assume ( n > 1 ):** - Suppose the prime factorization of ( n ) is ( n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} cdots p_t^{r_t} ). - Let ( sigma(n) ) denote the sum of all positive divisors of ( n ). 4. **Table arrangement:** - Suppose the table has ( k ) rows and ( l ) columns with ( k leq l ) and each cell contains a distinct divisor of ( n ). - The total number of positive divisors of ( n ) is given by ( (r_1 + 1)(r_2 + 1) cdots (r_t + 1) = kl ). 5. **Sum constraints:** - All row sums are equal and all column sums are equal. - Consider the column containing the number ( n ). The sum of entries in each column is ( frac{sigma(n)}{l} ). 6. **Inequality on Column Sums:** - Since ( frac{sigma(n)}{l} geq n ), we must have: [ frac{sigma(n)}{n} geq l ] 7. **Analyzing ( sigma(n) ):** - The divisor sum ( sigma(n) ): [ sigma(n) = prod_{i=1}^t left(frac{p_i^{r_i+1} - 1}{p_i - 1}right) ] - Dividing this by ( n ), we have: [ frac{sigma(n)}{n} = prod_{i=1}^t left(1 + frac{1}{p_i} + frac{1}{p_i^2} + cdots + frac{1}{p_i^{r_i}}right) ] 8. **Maximum Bound:** - We substitute the inequality derived previously in terms of a function: [ left(prod_{i=1}^t (r_i + 1)right) leq l^2 ] - Let’s define: [ f(p, r) = frac{r + 1}{left(1 + frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{p^2} + cdots + frac{1}{p^r}right)^2} = frac{(r + 1)(1 - frac{1}{p})^2}{(1 - frac{1}{p^{r+1}})^2} ] 9. **Function Analysis for Small Primes:** - Using some calculations: [ f(2, 1) = frac{8}{9}, quad f(2, 2) = frac{48}{49}, quad f(3, 1) = frac{9}{8} ] - Notice ( f(3, 1) > 1 ), indicating ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ).

These numbers are part of our sample, and they already follow the systematic interval of 12 since 30 - 6 = 24 and 42 - 30 = 12. Since 30 and 42 are multiples of 12 and part of the sample, we can deduce that the students in the sample have numbers that are multiples of 12 plus 6 (the smallest number in the sample). Let x be the number we are looking for. According to the systematic sampling method, it must satisfy the condition that x is a multiple of 12 plus 6 and also comes before 6 in the sequence as it's the smallest number we have. The multiplications of 12 we have below 6 are 0 and -12, -24, etc., but we only consider the positive results as valid student numbers. Thus, x = 12 times 0 + 6 = 6 is the number we already have, and the only other possible number is for the case before that, which would be at an interval of 12 before 6. That would be 6 - 12 = -6, but since we don't have negative student numbers, we must start over from the end of the list and count backward by 12 from student number 48. Therefore: 48 - 12 = 36, but since student number 36 is not listed, the next interval would be another 12 backward: 36 - 12 = 24, which is also not given, so we try once more: 24 - 12 = 12, again not on the list. Finally, 12 - 12 = 0 which means we have completed a full cycle and should return to our initial starting point of 6.

The angle frac{11 pi}{4} is equivalent to frac{3 pi}{4} when considering its coterminal angle in the first rotation (since adding 2pi doesn't change the angle's position), which is in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive and sine is negative. However, since frac{11pi}{4} is actually one more complete rotation past frac{3pi}{4}, we end up in the fourth quadrant again, where cosine and sine have the same magnitudes but different signs compared to their first rotation counterparts.

This rearrangement is based on the symmetry of the figure and the fact that D, E, and F are midpoints of their respective arcs, making the arcs congruent. 3. **Determine the Shape of the Shaded Region**: After rearranging the sectors as described, the shaded region forms a rectangle.

The length of the rectangle is the diameter of the semicircles, which is 2 units (since the radius is 1 unit), and the width is the radius of the semicircles, which is 1 unit.

Since an elephant can only move forward and there are no other temples to protect or destroy, the lone temple remains protected by default. Therefore, the base case of n=1 holds, as the single temple is inherently intouchable. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement is true for any number k of temples, where k < n. This means that for any k temples, there is exactly one temple that is intouchable. 3. **Inductive Step:** Consider the case with n temples. We will show that there exists a unique intouchable temple among these n temples. 4. **Reduction:** Remove the elephants immediately to the left of the first temple and to the right of the last temple. These elephants cannot protect any temple because they can only move away from the temples. 5. **Selecting the Largest Elephant:** Among the remaining 2n - 2 elephants, identify the largest elephant. Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume that this largest elephant is the one on the right of temple T_k. 6. **Divide and Conquer:** Apply the inductive hypothesis to the segment of temples from T_1 to T_k. According to the hypothesis, there exists exactly one temple, say T_i (i leq k), that is intouchable within this segment. 7. **Verification of Intouchability:** - Since T_i is intouchable within the first k temples, none of the elephants guarding T_1 to T_k can reach T_i. - Any elephant to the right of T_k would need to pass through the largest elephant (which is on the right of T_k) to reach temple T_i. Given the definition of the largest elephant, this is impossible. 8. **Unicity:** - The largest elephant (on the right of T_k) can potentially trample any other elephant to the right, maintaining the order and preventing any other temple from being intouchable. - Thus, the only intouchable temple within the entire set of n temples must be T_i, proving its uniqueness. # Conclusion: By strong induction, we have shown that for any number of temples n, there exists exactly one intouchable temple.

The cost price is 10 yuan per item. Therefore, the profit y can be calculated as follows: [ y = (100 - 2x)(x + 40 - 10) = (100 - 2x)(x + 30) = -2x^2 + 40x + 3000. ] - **For 30leqslant xleqslant 50:** The selling price is fixed at 70 yuan per item, and the daily sales volume remains 100 - 2x items.

This can be rewritten as: [ y = -2(x^2 - 20x) + 3000 = -2(x - 10)^2 + 3200. ] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at x = 10. At this point, the maximum profit is: [ y_{text{max}} = 3200. ] - **For 30leqslant xleqslant 50:** The profit function is linear y = -120x + 6000. As x increases, y decreases, indicating the maximum profit occurs at the smallest value of x in this interval, which is x = 30. Substituting x = 30 into the profit function gives: [ y_{text{max}} = -120(30) + 6000 = 2400. ] - **Conclusion:** Comparing the maximum profits in both intervals, the highest profit occurs on the 10th day with a profit of 3200 yuan.

For the angle frac {11pi }{3}, we notice that: frac {11pi }{3} = 3pi + frac {2pi }{3} Since 3pi corresponds to one-and-a-half times the full circle, we can subtract this off to get an angle that is co-terminal with frac {11pi }{3} and within our target range of 0 to 2pi: frac {11pi }{3} - 3pi = frac {11pi }{3} - frac {9pi }{3} = frac {2pi }{3} Now, we can simply evaluate the tangent at this reduced angle.

Given this setup, we aim to find the area of the inscribed rectangle. To do this, we first observe that since CD is perpendicular to AB, and WX is the height of the rectangle, we have ND = WX = x. This implies that the remaining part of the altitude, CN, is equal to h - x. Next, we note that the sides of the rectangle are parallel, specifically XY parallel WZ. This parallelism leads to the triangles triangle CXY and triangle CAB being similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) Similarity Criterion. To find the base of the rectangle, let's denote it as n.

Let us follow the steps suggested in the solution. 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup**: Let Omega be the circumcircle of triangle ABC, O be its center, and R be its radius. 2. **Behavior of Symmetric Lines**: When the lines d_{a}, d_{b}, and d_{c} rotate uniformly around the vertices of the triangle, their symmetric counterparts also rotate at the same angular speed around the corresponding points symmetric to the vertices relative to the opposite sides. Therefore, (i) the angles of triangle XYZ do not depend on the choice of d_{a}, d_{b}, d_{c}, so all such triangles are similar, and (ii) points X, Y, and Z move with the same angular speed along three circles. 3. **Analyzing Special Cases**: We consider special cases where d_{a} and d_{b} coincide with the line segment AB. Let A' and B' be the points symmetric to A and B about the opposite sides of ABC, respectively. Thus, Z is at the intersection of lines AB' and BA', and points Y and X lie on lines parallel to AB at twice the distance from C. 4. **Properties of Angle Bisectors**: Note that the angle bisectors of angles ZXY and ZYX are perpendicular to AC and BC, respectively (see the provided figure). 5. **Projections onto AC**: Consider the projections of O and the center of the inscribed circle of XYZ on the line AC. Point O projects to the midpoint of AC. Since X is obtained as a midpoint symmetric to A with respect to the midpoint of AC, so Y and the incenter of XYZ also project to this point. 6. **Distance from O to Incenter**: We know the distance from O to the midpoint of side AC is half the radius R of Omega, and since X lies midway symmetric to A, it is clear that the incenter of triangle XYZ lies on a circle whose radius is 2R from O when d_{a} and d_{b} are aligned to AB. The same result holds when considering other sides of ABC. 7. **Final Conclusion**: Therefore, given that the incenter trace circles whose centers are about the same distance from the vertices of O when rotating d_{a}, d_{b}, d_{c} around any vertex of ABC.

Given the numbers ( m ) and ( n ) on the blackboard, the rule allows us to write ( m + n + mn ).

For a ((k+1))-gon, we can remove one triangle, color the remaining (k)-gon, and then color the removed triangle such that it fits the chessboard pattern. 2. **Orienting the Triangles:** - Once the triangles are colored, we orient each black triangle. Since the sides of the black triangles do not interfere with one another, this can be done without any issues. - After orienting the black triangles, we complete the orientation of the diagonals so that all triangles (both black and white) are oriented. 3. **Analyzing the Borders:** - We observe that the sides between (A_{i_1}) and (A_{i_2}) (going in the direction in which the vertices of the polygon are numbered) all have the same color. This is the same as the color of those between (A_{i_3}) and (A_{i_4}), and so on. The other sides have the other color. - Each triangle is oriented, and each cycle has a border of 0.

This is the same as x * x * x, which is x^3. So the equation becomes: x + x^3 = 10 Now, let's rearrange the equation to set it to zero: x^3 + x - 10 = 0 This is a cubic equation, and solving it algebraically can be complex. However, we can try to find an integer solution by checking the factors of 10, which are ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10. Let's check if any of these values satisfy the equation: If x = 1: 1^3 + 1 - 10 = 1 + 1 - 10 = -8 (not equal to 0) If x = -1: (-1)^3 + (-1) - 10 = -1 - 1 - 10 = -12 (not equal to 0) If x = 2: 2^3 + 2 - 10 = 8 + 2 - 10 = 0 So, x = 2 satisfies the equation.

All mayors, except for one, noticed that their count results are divisible by 2016. Prove that the result of the remaining mayor is also divisible by 2016.","completion":"1. Let's designate a particular city A as the capital. Define a city as **even** if the route from A to that city involves an even number of flights; otherwise, define it as **odd**. By this designation, the city A is even. - **Observation**: The parity (even or odd) of the cities connected by a flight will always differ. This implies that the route between any two directly connected cities changes parity. 2. We need to show that the sum of numbers obtained by the mayors of even cities equals the sum obtained by the mayors of odd cities. Consequently, if all but one mayor's results are divisible by 2016, the same must be true for the remaining mayor. - Note: Each city exhibits a unique numbering such that on any route starting at that city, the city numbers are in ascending order. Importantly, in any such numeration, the city X will carry the number 1. This setup ensures that any valid numeration fits not more than one city. 3. Consider a numbering suitable for an even city E. Let's say within that numbering, the number 2 is held by city W. Since W and E are connected directly, and they have different parities, this implies W must be odd. - **Swapping**: If we interchange the numbers 1 and 2 in this numeration: - City W (originally holding 2, now holds 1). - City E (originally holding 1, now holds 2). 4. Investigate any route m starting from city W. Such a route results from some route originating from E by: - **Adding** W at the beginning (if m goes through E, 1 changes place with 2 to keep the new numeration valid). - **Removing** E if it is initially present. - This analysis implies that after the swapping of 1 and 2, the sequence of city numbers remains in ascending order. 5. Hence, following this swap, a valid numeration for an even city morphs into a valid one for an odd city, and vice versa. There is an unequivocal one-to-one matching between these numerations: - This matching means that both even and odd numerations are evenly distributed. 6. Therefore, by this symmetry and given that the sum of results obtained by even city mayors equates to the odd city mayors, and provided that all but one mayor's results are divisible by 2016, it necessitates the remaining mayor’s result to also be divisible by 2016.

We have two types of packages: - A package of 12 pens for 10. - A package of 20 pens for 15.

For example, a rectangle with sides 5 and 6 is an almost-square. We are asked if there exists an almost-square that can be divided into 2010 almost-squares. 2. **Analyze Basic Almost-Square:** The simplest almost-square is a 2 times 1 rectangle. This is a basic building block for constructing larger almost-squares. 3. **Construction of a Large Almost-Square:** Let's construct a large almost-square using smaller almost-squares. Consider an almost-square with dimensions 2009 times 2008. This is because the sides differ by just 1. 4. **Adding Strips to Form Full Almost-Square:** To achieve a total area that can be split into 2010 almost-squares, we add strips composed of our smallest almost-square (dominoes). 4.1 Add a strip of 1004 dominoes to the right side of the 2009 times 2008 almost-square. This strip measures 2 times 1004, contributing an area of 2 times 1004 = 2008. 4.2 Add a strip of 1005 dominoes to the top of the newly formed shape. This strip measures 2 times 1005, contributing an area of 2 times 1005 = 2010. 5. **Detailed Calculation of Total Area:** Then, we calculate the overall shape formed by: - Initial almost-square: 2009 times 2008 = 2009 - Adding right strip: 2009 times 2012 (after adding 2 times 1004 right strip) - Adding top strip: 2002 times 1005 6. **Conclusion:** By piecing together these almost-squares, Vasya's almost-square (2009 x 2008) with strips we achieve construction that sums up the almost-squares to 2010.

To find the minimum value, we use the inequality (4s^2 + t^2 geq 4st). This inequality can be derived from the fact that the sum of squares is always greater than or equal to twice the product of the terms, i.e., (a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab). 3. **Applying the Inequality**: [ 4s^2 + t^2 geq 4st ] Dividing both sides by (5st): [ frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st} geq frac{4st}{5st} = frac{4}{5} ] 4. **Example to Achieve Minimum**: To show that the minimum value of (frac{4}{5}) can be achieved, consider a specific configuration of the quadrilateral (ABCD).

Consider a point P on the bisector of the angle angle ABC. Through this point P, we need to draw a secant line intersecting the sides AB and BC at points A_1 and B_1 respectively.

Let this line intersect AB at A_2 and the other side of the angle that is parallel to BC at C_1. 3.

Among these 2m sums, denote the smallest one as p. Suppose p is the sum of the numbers in the first row. 3. **Case Analysis:** If p geq frac{m}{2}, then the sum of all numbers in the table, S, satisfies: [ S geq m cdot frac{m}{2} = frac{m^2}{2} ] Therefore, the desired result follows. 4. **Suppose p < frac{m}{2}:** Let k be the number of cells in the first row that contain 0. Then we have k > frac{m}{2} because the sum of the numbers in the first row is less than frac{m}{2}, and given that any cell with 0 in the grid implies the total in its row and column must be at least m. 5. **Estimate the Total Sum:** The sum of all numbers in the table S can be estimated by considering the contributions from the cells with 0 in the first row.

Since this condition is possible within the given range x > 0, option C is indeed correct because it meets the condition for equality, and the inequality demonstrates that the expression is always greater than or equal to 2 for x > 0. **For option D:** Given y=4x-2+frac{1}{4x-5} for x < frac{5}{4}, we can rewrite the expression considering 5-4x > 0 as follows: [ y=4x-2+frac{1}{4x-5} = -left[(5-4x)+frac{1}{5-4x}right] + 3 ] Applying the AM-GM inequality: [ (5-4x)+frac{1}{5-4x} geq 2sqrt{(5-4x) cdot frac{1}{5-4x}} = 2 ] Thus, [ y leqslant -2 + 3 = 1 ] The equality holds when 5-4x = frac{1}{5-4x}, which is possible when x=1, a condition that satisfies x < frac{5}{4}.

If the total number of times Matt rode during that two weeks is three times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit, and additionally, the total number of unique horses Maurice rode during his visit equates to the total number of times he had ridden before the visit, then how many times had Maurice been horseback riding before visiting Matt?","completion":"Let's denote the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit as M.

In this case, we can divide by 66.67 (since 10666.67 and 12000 are both divisible by 66.67): X : J = (10666.67 / 66.67) : (12000 / 66.67) X : J = 160 : 180 We can simplify this ratio further by dividing both sides by 20: X : J = (160 / 20) : (180 / 20) X : J = 8 : 9 Therefore, the ratio between XYZ and Rajeev is boxed{8:9} ."},{"prompt":"f the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{1}=1，a_{2}= frac {1}{2}，2a_{n+1}=4a_{n}2a_{n1}+3 (n geq 2), find the minimum value of na_n.","completion":"From the given recurrence relation 2a_{n+1}=4a_{n}-2a_{n-1}+3, we can derive 2(a_{n+1} - a_{n}) - 2(a_{n} - a_{n-1}) = 3, which simplifies to (a_{n+1} - a_{n}) - (a_{n} - a_{n-1}) = frac{3}{2} quad (n geq 2).

Setting f'(x) = 0 gives us x = pmfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and considering the domain x > -1, only x = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} is valid. By analyzing the sign of f'(x), we find: - When xin(-1,-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) cup (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, +infty), f'(x) > 0. - When xin(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}), f'(x) < 0. Hence, the function f(x) has a local maximum at x = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} and a local minimum at x = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

Let's look into each scenario with details: **Scenario 1** We can further break it down into two sub-scenarios: - Teacher A is with either C or D, or - Teacher B is with either C or D. Since C and D are interchangeable in terms of being paired with A or B and the remaining one will be alone in another class, we need to count the permutations for both A and B: - For teacher A to be paired with either C or D, there are 2 choices of who to pair A with and 3! ways to arrange the three different classes. So, we have a total of: 2 times 3! = 2 times 6 = 12 text{ways for A with either C or D}. - Similarly for B paired with either C or D, we also have 12 ways.

Given that a prism's lateral faces are connected by their edges, and these edges are parallel because they extend from the parallel edges of the bases, we can conclude that the lateral faces must indeed be parallelograms. Moreover, since each pair of adjacent parallelograms shares a common side (which is an edge of the prism), and these sides are parallel (as they extend from the parallel sides of the bases), this further supports the correctness of statement A.

It is known that if any one child is excluded, the remaining 99 children can be divided into 33 groups of three such that in each group all three children are mutual friends. Find the minimum possible number of pairs of children who are friends.","completion":"1. **Problem Statement Interpretation:** We start by translating the problem into the language of graph theory with the following correspondences: - Each child represents a vertex. - Each mutual friendship between two children represents an edge. Thus, we have a graph (G) with 100 vertices. The condition states that if any vertex is removed, the remaining 99 vertices can be divided into 33 groups of 3 vertices each, such that every group forms a triangle (i.e., every pair of vertices in each group is connected by an edge). 2. **Constructing a Graph Example:** To find the minimum number of edges, let’s construct a graph: - Consider 99 vertices, excluding a specific vertex (A). - These 99 vertices can be partitioned into 33 triangles (with 3 vertices each). Within each triangle, all pairs are connected. - Next, connect the vertex (A) to every other vertex. Each of the 33 groups (triangles) has 3 edges, so the total number of edges among these 99 vertices is: [ 33 times 3 = 99 text{ edges} ] Then, vertex (A) is connected to each of the 99 other vertices, adding: [ 99 text{ edges} ] Therefore, the total number of edges in the constructed graph is: [ 99 + 99 = 198 text{ edges} ] 3. **Verifying the Minimum Edge Requirement:** We need to show that 198 is the minimum possible number of edges. We will use mathematical induction on ( k ), defined as follows: - Call a graph on ( 3k + 1 ) vertices \\"good\\" if, when any one vertex is removed, the remaining ( 3k ) vertices can always be partitioned into ( k ) triangles. **Base case ( ( k = 1 ) )**: A graph with 4 vertices ( K_4 ) (complete graph with 4 vertices): - Removing any vertex from ( K_4 ) leaves a triangle ( ( K_3 ) ) consisting of all pairs connected. - ( K_4 ) has ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) edges, meeting the requirement. **Inductive step**: Assume a good graph on ( 3k + 1 ) vertices has at least ( 6k ) edges. If any vertex is connected to at least 4 other vertices, the total number of edges: [ frac{(3k + 1) times 4}{2} = 2(3k + 1) ] This exceeds ( 6k ), the number we need. - Now consider the case where a vertex ( A ) is connected to at most 3 other vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ). Removing ( A ) and an arbitrary vertex ( Y ) allows us to re-assign ( A ) into any existing or new triangle. - Consider the worst-case scenario with fewer than 4 connections: ( A ) has 3 neighbors ( B, C, ) and ( D ). Then: - Removing ( B ) (or ( C ), ( D )) ensures remaining vertices can still form required triangles. Ultimately, at least ( 3/2 times 4 = 6 ) edges will be preserved when ( 2(3k + 1) > 6k ) are expected.

Then: [ S_{N_1} = S_{2^{2(m+1)}} > m+1 geq m+b ] Hence, there exists ( n in mathbb{N}^* ) with: [ N_0 < n < N_1 quad text{such that} quad m+a < S_n < m+b ] Otherwise, there would necessarily exist ( k ) where: [ N_0 < k quad text{and} quad S_{k-1} leq m+a quad text{and} quad S_k geq m+b ] This would lead to a contradiction since: [ S_k - S_{k-1} geq b-a ] But: [ S_k - S_{k-1} = frac{1}{k} < frac{1}{N_0} < b-a ] Thus, there exists ( n in mathbb{N}^* ) such that: [ S_n - lfloor S_n rfloor in (a, b) ] 5. **Contradiction and Infiniteness:** Assume there are only finitely many ( n in mathbb{N}^* ) such that ( S_{n_j} - lfloor S_{n_j} rfloor in (a, b) ). Let: [ c = min { S_{n_j} - lfloor S_{n_j} rfloor } ] where ( 1 leq j leq k ), then: [ a < c < b ] By previous arguments, infinitely many ( n in mathbb{N}^* ) exist such that: [ S_n - lfloor S_n rfloor in (a, b) ] # Conclusion: The sequence ( { S_n - lfloor S_n rfloor } ) contains infinitely many terms in the interval ( (a, b) ).

So, the amount spent on house rent is 20% of (I - 300), which is (20/100) * (I - 300) = Rs. 140. Now we have two equations: 1) (P/100) * I = 300 2) (20/100) * (I - 300) = 140 Let's solve equation 2) first to find I: (20/100) * (I - 300) = 140 => (1/5) * (I - 300) = 140 => I - 300 = 140 * 5 => I - 300 = 700 => I = 700 + 300 => I = 1000 Now that we have the total income I, we can use equation 1) to find P%: (P/100) * I = 300 => (P/100) * 1000 = 300 => P * 10 = 300 => P = 300 / 10 => P = 30 Therefore, the percentage of his income Bhanu spends on petrol is boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"Find X+Y (in base 10), given the following addition problem in base 7: [ begin{array}{c@{}c@{;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & 5 & X & Y_{7} + & & & & 3 & 2_{7} cline{26} & & & 6 & 2 & X_{7} end{array} ]","completion":"From the middle column, solving X_7 + 3_7 = 2_7 in base 7.

This configuration implies: - The first '0' (now in position 3) and the '2' (in position 2) cannot be swapped further. * Also, swapping any digit that moves a '0' to the first position is forbidden. 4. **Evaluating Remaining Moves:** * Given this, C3PO effectively locks two digits (positions 2 and 3) by his first move. * From there, the remaining sequences beyond the third digit ( (1201201201) ) contain three '2's and three '1's with no '0's at the beginning. 5. **Subsequent Moves and Constraints:** * Any subsequent pairs for swapping will be free to: a. Swap digits within chunks separated by locked pairs. b. Avoid revisiting locked pairs (positions 2 and 3 in this case) or placing '0' in the first position. * Since the number of total pairs needing examination is even (remaining 10), changes evenly distribute between both players, making R2D2 face the unavoidable no-move scenario first. 6. **Conclusion:** * Given this strategic advanced move by C3PO, R2D2 will face a no-more-possible swap situation after all even possible and allowed swap pairs are exhausted. * Thus, C3PO wins by a correctly chosen first move leveraging swap restrictions optimally.

This configuration forms a rectangle (UWCV). 8. **Orthogonal Projections in the Rectangle**: - Considering the rectangle (UWCV) and its projections: - (W') is the orthogonal projection of (W) onto (AB). - (V') is the orthogonal projection of (V) onto (AB). 9. **Comparing Distances**: - Each pair ((A, U)), ((U, B)), and ((W', V')) have distances (frac{c}{2}) (where (c) is the length of hypotenuse (AB)). - As the projective transformation from (AB) to itself, converting (F) to (G), coincides with a translation by (frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AB}) in three points, it must be this translation. 10. **Conclusion**: - Hence, the points (F) and (G) always have the distance (frac{c}{2}), which means (FG) is half the length of (AB).

At x=0, this simplifies to: f'(0) = e^{0} + kcdot0cdot e^{0} = 1. Additionally, because f(0)=0cdot e^{kcdot0}=0, the y-coordinate of the point of tangency is 0. Hence, the equation of the tangent line at the point (0,f(0)) is: y = f'(0)(x-0) + f(0), Substituting f'(0) = 1 and f(0) = 0, we find: y = x. **(Ⅱ) Determining intervals of monotonicity:** We need to find where the derivative f'(x) is positive (for increasing behavior) or negative (for decreasing behavior). Let's investigate the sign changes of f'(x): f'(x) = (1+kx)e^{kx} = 0. To find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero. The exponential function e^{kx} is never zero, thus we only need to consider the zeroes of 1+kx, which lead to: x = -frac{1}{k}, (k neq 0). For k>0, when x in (-infty, -frac{1}{k}), we have f'(x) < 0, which means f(x) is monotonically decreasing in that interval. Conversely, when x in (-frac{1}{k}, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is monotonically increasing. Similarly, for k<0, when x in (-infty, -frac{1}{k}), f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is monotonically increasing, but when x in (-frac{1}{k}, +infty), f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is monotonically decreasing. **(Ⅲ) Finding the range of k for the monotonic increase in (-1,1):** Based on the monotonicity intervals identified in part (Ⅱ), for k>0, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-1,1) if and only if: -frac{1}{k} leq -1, which simplifies to: k leq 1.

Thus, the left-hand side must also be divisible by q^2. Since p and q are relatively prime, this implies that q^2 mid s^2, or q mid s. 5. Similarly, since the right-hand side is divisible by s^2, the left-hand side must also be divisible by s^2. Given that r and s are relatively prime, this implies that s^2 mid q^2, or s mid q. 6.

The gradient of radius CP is given by the change in y over the change in x, which is: text{slope of } CP = frac{2 - 0}{1 - 0} = 2. The slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of CP because the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

The equation of a straight line in point-slope form is given by y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point that the line passes through. Using point P(1, 2) and the slope m = -frac{1}{2}, the equation of the tangent line becomes: y - 2 = -frac{1}{2}(x - 1).

The reaction between methane (CH4) and chlorine (Cl2) typically proceeds via a radical halogenation mechanism, which can result in the substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms in methane with chlorine atoms. However, for simplicity, let's consider the initial step where one hydrogen atom is substituted to form HCl and CH3Cl (methyl chloride). The balanced equation for this reaction is: CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of CH4 reacts with 1 mole of Cl2 to produce 1 mole of HCl (and 1 mole of CH3Cl). You have 2 moles of CH4 and 4 moles of Cl2. Since the reaction requires a 1:1 molar ratio of CH4 to Cl2, the limiting reactant will determine the amount of HCl produced. In this case, CH4 is the limiting reactant because you have fewer moles of CH4 (2 moles) compared to Cl2 (4 moles). Therefore, the reaction will stop once all the CH4 has been consumed.

An isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and we are given two different lengths: 4cm and 9cm. We need to determine which length represents the equal sides and then calculate the perimeter accordingly. First, let's consider the scenario where the equal sides are 4cm each. In this case, we would have the sides of the triangle as 4cm, 4cm, and 9cm. However, for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Checking this condition: [4cm + 4cm lt 9cm] [8cm lt 9cm] This condition does not hold, which means that having the equal sides as 4cm each does not form a valid triangle. Therefore, this possibility is discarded. Next, let's consider the scenario where the equal sides are 9cm each. In this case, the sides of the triangle would be 9cm, 9cm, and 4cm. Checking the triangle inequality condition for these lengths: [9cm + 9cm > 4cm] [18cm > 4cm] This condition holds, meaning that a triangle with these dimensions is possible. Given that the equal sides are 9cm each and the third side is 4cm, we can calculate the perimeter of the triangle as the sum of its sides: [Perimeter = 9cm + 9cm + 4cm = 22cm] Therefore, the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is boxed{22cm}."},{"prompt":"w many proper subsets does the set {1, 2} have?

These cities are natural choices for the start and end points because once you leave such a city, you cannot return if you are visiting each city exactly once. 5. **Identify Single-Degree Cities:** From the graph: - Санкт-Петербург (St. Petersburg) connects only to Тверь (1 connection), - Ярославль (Yaroslavl) connects only to Нижний Новгород (Nizhny Novgorod) (1 connection). 6. **Validating Starting Cities:** Both Санкт-Петербург and Ярославль have only one connecting route, making them potential starting or ending points in the travel route. 7. **Construct Possible Paths:** If we start at Санкт-Петербург and follow one valid sequence, it could be: - Санкт-Петербург -> Тверь -> Москва -> Казань -> Нижний Новгород -> Ярославль. The reverse path when starting at Ярославль would be the same when read backward: - Ярославль -> Нижний Новгород -> Казань -> Москва -> Тверь -> Санкт-Петербург.

If the two colours agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow. Proposed by *India*","completion":"1. **Lemma 1**: Let two circles in the configuration cross at points ( x ) and ( y ). Then ( x ) and ( y ) are either both yellow or both non-yellow. This is because the numbers of interior vertices on the four arcs determined by ( x ) and ( y ) on the two circles have like parities. Each circle in the configuration contains an even number of yellow vertices. **Proof of Lemma 1**: Consider two circles ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) intersecting at points ( x ) and ( y ). The arcs between ( x ) and ( y ) on ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) can be labeled as ( overarc{xy} ) and ( overarc{yx} ). Since the vertices are alternately colored, the number of vertices between ( x ) and ( y ) on each arc must be even. Therefore, if ( x ) is yellow, then ( y ) must also be yellow, and vice versa. This proves that ( x ) and ( y ) are either both yellow or both non-yellow. 2. **Lemma 2**: If ( overarc{xy} ), ( overarc{yz} ), and ( overarc{zx} ) are circular arcs of three pairwise distinct circles in the configuration, then the number of yellow vertices in the set ({x, y, z}) is odd. **Proof of Lemma 2**: Consider three circles ( C_1 ), ( C_2 ), and ( C_3 ) intersecting at points ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ). By Lemma 1, the number of yellow vertices on each arc is even. Since the total number of vertices in the set ({x, y, z}) is three, and each vertex is counted twice (once for each intersecting circle), the number of yellow vertices must be odd. 3. **Classification of Circles**: The two lemmas show that the circles in the configuration split into two classes. Consider any circle ( C ) along with all circles that cross ( C ) at yellow points to form one class; the remaining circles then form the other class. Lemma 2 shows that any pair of circles in the same class cross at yellow points, otherwise, they cross at non-yellow points. Call the circles from the two classes \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" respectively. 4. **Regions and Arcs**: Let ( w ) and ( b ) be the numbers of white and black circles, respectively; clearly, ( w + b = n ). Assume that ( w ge b ), and that there is no yellow region. Clearly, ( b ge 1 ), otherwise each region is yellow. The white circles subdivide the plane into ( w(w-1) + 2 ) larger regions, call them \\"white regions\\". The white circles (or rather their boundaries) subdivide each black circle into \\"black arcs\\". Since there are no yellow regions, each white region contains at least one black arc. 5. **Counting Crossings**: Consider any white region, let it contain ( t ge 1 ) black arcs. We claim that the number of points at which ( t ) arcs cross doesn't exceed ( t - 1 ). To prove that, consider a multigraph whose vertices are these black arcs, two vertices being joined by an edge for each point at which the corresponding arcs cross. If this graph had more than ( t - 1 ) edges, it would contain a cycle, since it has ( t ) vertices; this cycle would correspond to a closed contour formed by black sub-arcs, lying inside the region under consideration. This contour would, in turn, define at least one yellow region, which is impossible. 6. **Summing Up**: Let ( t_i ) be the number of black arcs inside the ( i )-th white region. The total number of black arcs is (sum_i t_i = 2wb), they cross at (2 binom{b}{2} = b(b-1)) points. By the preceding argument, [ b(b-1) leq sum_{i=1}^{w^2-w+2} (t_i - 1) = sum_{i=1}^{w^2-w+2} t_i - (w^2-w+2) = 2wb - (w^2-w+2). ] Equivalently, [ (w - b)^2 ge w + b - 2 = n - 2, ] which is the case if and only if ( w - b leq lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor ). Consequently, [ b ge w ge frac{n + lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor}{2}, ] so there are at most ( 2(w-1) leq n + lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor - 2 ) yellow vertices on each circle, a contradiction.

Then: [ angle A_1YX > angle A_1 PY > angle A_2 Z Y, ] which contradicts our initial angle equality. Hence, this assumption is false. - Therefore, ( P ) must lie outside of ( k_2 ) and is uniquely determined by the ratio (frac{PZ}{PY} = frac{ZY}{YX}). 6. **Conclusion**: - As (P) is determined uniquely and lies on line ( XY ), the two lines (A_1A_2) and (B_1B_2) indeed intersect at this point (P).

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Therefore, if |x| = 5, x can be either 5 or -5 because both 5 and -5 are 5 units away from zero. Similarly, if |y| = 2, y can be either 2 or -2 for the same reason. Thus, we have: - x = pm 5 - y = pm 2 # Part 2: Find the value of x + y given |x - y| = x - y Given that |x - y| = x - y, this implies that x - y is non-negative because the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, and if the absolute value of a number equals the number itself, then the number must be non-negative or zero. Therefore, we have: - x - y geqslant 0 From the possible values of x and y determined in Part 1, we consider the combinations that satisfy x - y geqslant 0: 1. When x = 5 and y = 2, we have x - y = 5 - 2 = 3 geqslant 0. In this case, x + y = 5 + 2 = 7. 2. When x = 5 and y = -2, we have x - y = 5 - (-2) = 5 + 2 = 7 geqslant 0. In this case, x + y = 5 + (-2) = 3. Therefore, the possible values of x + y given |x - y| = x - y are 7 and 3.

According to the problem, if the person walks at 14 km/hr instead of 10 km/hr, he would have walked 20 km more. This means that in the same amount of time, he would have travelled ( D + 20 ) km at 14 km/hr. So, the time taken to travel ( D + 20 ) km at 14 km/hr would be ( frac{D + 20}{14} ) hours.

So, we are looking for a situation where: J = 3B Using the first relationship (J = C + 12), we can substitute J in the above equation: C + 12 = 3B Now, we need to express B in terms of C using the second relationship (C = B + 7): B = C - 7 Substitute B in the equation C + 12 = 3B: C + 12 = 3(C - 7) Now, let's solve for C: C + 12 = 3C - 21 Add 21 to both sides: C + 33 = 3C Subtract C from both sides: 33 = 2C Divide both sides by 2: C = 33 / 2 C = 16.5 So, Charlie will be 16.5 years old when Jenny becomes thrice as old as Bobby.

Let ( text{sum}(T) ) denote the sum of elements of a set ( T ) (if ( T ) is empty, then ( text{sum}(T) = 0 )). 2. **Prove that ( k = 2^m ) works:** To show that all ( k = 2^m ) work, we take ( S = {3^1, 3^2, ldots, 3^m} cup {2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ldots} ). For any integer ( z > 3^{m+1000} ), the number ( z - text{sum}(T) ) can be written using powers of 2 in exactly one way for any subset ( T ) of ( S ). Thus, there are exactly ( 2^m ) ways to write ( z ) in terms of distinct elements in ( S ). 3. **Show that ( k ) must be a power of 2:** - **Lemma 1:** If the problem condition holds with ( k ge 3 ), then ( S = F cup B ) where ( F ) is a finite set and ( B ) is a majorized infinite set. - **Proof:** Suppose for all ( n ge N ), there are exactly ( k ) ways to write ( n ) in terms of distinct elements of ( S ). Let ( s_i ) be the ( i )-th smallest element in ( S ). Let ( t ) be the smallest integer such that ( s_t ge N ). We prove that we can take ( B = {s_t, s_{t+1}, s_{t+2}, ldots} ). Consider any ( i > j ge t ). The sum ( s_i + s_j ) can be written in exactly ( k ) ways. However, ( s_j ) can be written in exactly ( k ) ways, so all ways to write ( s_i + s_j ) must contain the element ( s_i ). On the other hand, consider the ( k ) ways to write ( s_i ). Suppose there is a way to write ( s_i = s_{i_1} + s_{i_2} + ldots + s_{i_p} ) where ( i_1 > i_2 > ldots > i_p ) with ( p ge 2 ) and all indices are not equal to ( j ). Then, ( s_i + s_j = s_j + s_{i_1} + s_{i_2} + ldots + s_{i_p} ) is a way to write ( s_i + s_j ) in terms of distinct elements in ( S ) without ( s_i ), a contradiction. Thus, ( s_j ) must appear in any sum representation of ( s_i ) with ( ge 2 ) elements for all ( t le j < i ). Hence, ( s_i = s_{i-1} + s_{i-2} + ldots + s_t + X ) for some ( X ). Note that ( X > 0 ) since we require at least two ways to write ( X ) in terms of distinct elements in ( S ) since ( k ge 3 ). Thus, ( s_i > s_{i-1} + s_{i-2} + ldots + s_t ), proving that ( B ) is indeed majorized. - **Lemma 2:** Let ( B ) be a majorized infinite set. Then, ( text{ways}(B, x) le 1 ) for all ( x ). - **Proof:** Let ( B = {b_1, b_2, b_3, ldots} ) where ( b_i < b_{i+1} ) for all ( i ge 1 ). Clearly, ( text{ways}(B, x) le 1 ) for all ( x le b_1 ). Now, we prove the claim ( text{ways}(B, x) le 1 ) by strong induction. Suppose ( x ge b_1 ). Let ( i ) be the largest integer such that ( x ge b_i ). ( b_i ) must be included in the sum representation of ( x ), since otherwise ( b_{i-1} + b_{i-2} + ldots + b_1 < b_i le x ). Hence, ( text{ways}(B, x) = text{ways}(B, x - b_i) le 1 ) by the induction hypothesis. - **Combining Lemmas:** Let ( S = F cup B ) as in our lemma and let ( b_i ) be the ( i )-th smallest element of ( B ). Consider the infinite binary vector ( V = (v_1, v_2, ldots) ) where ( v_i = text{ways}(B, i) ). Denote ( text{gap}(i) ) as ( b_i - (b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_{i-1}) > 0 ) since ( B ) is majorized. Now, we observe that our vector ( V ) takes a special form. - **Lemma 3:** Define ( W_n ) as the vector obtained by removing the first ( n ) elements of ( V ). Let ( N ) be a fixed positive integer. Then, for any prefix ( W ) of ( V ), there exists an integer ( N' > N ) such that ( W ) appears as a prefix of ( W_{N'} ). - **Proof:** Let ( i ) be the minimum integer such that ( V_i ) contains ( W ) as a prefix. Then, for all ( j ge i ), ( V_j ) contains ( W ) as a prefix. Choose ( j ) such that the length of ( V_j ) is larger than ( N ). Note that by the recursive definition, ( V_{j+1} ) contains a copy of ( V_j ) as a substring starting from a position larger than ( N ). Thus, we can choose ( N' ) appropriately to remove a prefix from ( V_{j+1} ) (and thus ( V )) such that the starting position is the starting position of the second copy of ( V_j ) in ( V_{j+1} ). - **Lemma 4:** For any integer ( l ), there exists a prefix of ( V ) with length ( ge l ) such that it can be written as the concatenation of ( W ), ( 1 ), and ( W ) where ( W ) is some binary vector containing ( 2^m - 1 ) ones for some ( m ge 0 ) (i.e., it is of the form ( (w_1, w_2, ldots, w_n, 1, w_1, w_2, ldots, w_n) ) and exactly ( 2^m - 1 ) of the ( w_i )s are ( 1 )s). - **Proof:** Let ( N > l^{2020} + 2020 ). Consider the sequence ( text{gap}(N), text{gap}(N+1), text{gap}(N+2), ldots ). Since all the terms are positive integers, there must exist some ( j ge N ) such that ( text{gap}(j) le text{gap}(j+1) ). Now, we look at vector ( V_{j+1} ). It is the concatenation of ( V_j ), ( text{gap}(j+1) - 1 ) zeros, a 1 followed by ( V_j ). We focus on the prefix which is the concatenation of ( V_j ) and ( text{gap}(j+1) - 1 ) zeros, which can be rewritten as the concatenation of ( V_{j-1} ), ( text{gap}(j) - 1 ) zeros, a 1, ( V_{j-1} ), and ( text{gap}(j+1) - 1 ) zeros. Since ( text{gap}(j) le text{gap}(j+1) ), choosing ( W ) as the concatenation of ( V_{j-1} ) and ( text{gap}(j) - 1 ) zeros works, since ( V_{j-1} ) contains exactly ( 2^{j-1} - 1 ) ones as noted before. Combining Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, for any ( N ), we can find a substring ( V' ) of our vector ( V ) of the form ( (v_s, v_{s+1}, v_{s+2}, ldots, v_{s+m-1}, v_{s+m}, v_{s+m+1}, ldots, v_{s+2m}) ) where ( s > N ) and ( m ge text{sum}(F) + 2020 ) such that ( v_i = v_{i+m+1} ) for all ( s le i le s+m-1 ), ( v_{s+m} = 1 ), and any substring of length ( m+1 ) in ( V' ) contains exactly ( 2^x ) ones for some integer ( x ) (follows from the fact that the first ( m+1 ) elements contain exactly ( 2^x ) ones and ( v_i = v_{i+m+1} )). In particular, choose ( N ) such that all integers ( ge N ) can be written as distinct elements of ( S ) in exactly ( k ) ways. Note that ( s+m ge N ), so ( s+m+i ) has exactly ( k ) sum representations in ( S ) for all ( 0 le i le m ). We will count the total number of sum representations of ( s+m ), ( s+m+1 ), ldots, ( s+2m ) in ( S ) in two ways. Obviously, this sum is equal to ( (m+1)k ). On the other hand, let ( G = (text{ways}(F, m), text{ways}(F, m-1), text{ways}(F, m-2), ldots, text{ways}(F, 0)) ). Observe that as ( m > text{sum}(F) ), the sum of elements in ( G ) is exactly ( 2^{|F|} ). Observe that by fixing the elements to use in ( F ), we find that the number of sum representations of ( s+m+i ) in ( S ) is (sum_{j=0}^{m} text{ways}(F, m-j) v_{s+i+j} ). Observe that this is equivalent to the dot product of ( G ) and a substring of length ( m+1 ) of ( V' ). Summing this value over all ( 0 le i le m ) and using the fact that ( V' ) is periodic with period ( m+1 ), we obtain [ sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{j=0}^{m} text{ways}(F, m-j) v_{s+i+j} = sum_{j=0}^{m} text{ways}(F, m-j) sum_{i=0}^{m} v_{s+i+j} = 2^{|F|} cdot sum_{i=0}^{m} v_{s+i} = 2^{|F|+x}. ] Hence, ( (m+1)k = 2^{|F|+x} ), which means that ( k ) divides a power of 2. Thus, ( k ) must be a power of 2, as desired.

Prove that ( n(n1)^{k1} ) can be expressed as the sum of ( n ) consecutive even numbers.","completion":"**Step 1**: Analyze the sequence of n numbers. Consider a sequence of n consecutive even numbers. Let the first term of this sequence be 2a. Therefore, the sequence can be expressed as: [ 2a, 2a + 2, 2a + 4, ldots, 2a + 2(n-1) ] **Step 2**: Calculate the sum of the first n consecutive even numbers. The sum of this arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: [ S_n = frac{n}{2} cdot (text{first term} + text{last term}) ] In this case, the first term is 2a and the last term is 2a + 2(n-1). Substituting these values, we get: [ S_n = frac{n}{2} cdot (2a + (2a + 2(n-1))) = frac{n}{2} cdot (2a + 2a + 2(n-1)) = frac{n}{2} cdot (4a + 2(n-1)) = n(2a + (n-1)) ] **Step 3**: Equate the sum of the sequence to the given expression. We know that the sum S_n given by n(2a + (n-1)) should equal n(n-1)^{k-1}. Therefore, we have: [ n(2a + (n-1)) = n(n-1)^{k-1} ] **Step 4**: Solve for a. Dividing both sides by n, we obtain: [ 2a + (n-1) = (n-1)^{k-1} ] Isolating a, we find: [ 2a = (n-1)^{k-1} - (n-1) ] [ a = frac{1}{2} left[(n-1)^{k-1} - (n-1)right] ] **Step 5**: Verify that a is an integer. Given k > 2 and n > 2, (n-1) and (n-1)^{k-1} are integers. The difference (n-1)^{k-1} - (n-1) will be an even number because both terms share a common multiple of (n-1). Dividing by 2 yields another integer, making a an integer.

In this straightforward scenario, it's clear that there is only one possible value for omega(A) for any subset A of D = {1, 2, ldots, n}. Hence, a(n) = 1 and consequently, lim_{n rightarrow infty} sqrt[n]{a(n)} = sqrt[n]{1} = 1. 2. Next, we consider the case when c geq 2. The set D = {1, 2, ldots, n} has 2^n - 1 non-empty subsets. The function omega(A) is defined over these 2^n - 1 non-empty subsets. 3. Define the set b_k for k = 1, 2, ldots, n as: b_k = {1, 2, ldots, k-1, k+1, ldots, n} = D - {k}. Together with the set D, we have n + 1 important sets: b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n, and D. 4. Using mathematical induction, it can be shown that if the values omega(b_1), omega(b_2), ldots, omega(b_n), omega(D) are determined, then the value of omega(A) for any non-empty subset A of D is also determined. 5. For a subset A which is an (n-k) element subset of D, suppose omega(A) is determined. Now consider a subset A of D with (n-k-1) elements. Choose an element m in D that does not belong to A. Define B = A cup {m}, an (n-k) element subset of D. By the inductive hypothesis, omega(B) is determined. 6. Since A = B cap b_m, using the properties of omega given in the problem, we get: omega(A) = min{omega(B), omega(b_m)}. This shows that omega(A) is determined as well. 7. The function omega is completely determined by the n+1 values omega(b_1), omega(b_2), ldots, omega(b_n), omega(D). 8. Since each value in omega(b_1), omega(b_2), ldots, omega(b_n), omega(D) can take at most c different values, it follows that: a(n) leq C^{n+1}. 9. On the other hand, for any choice of C^n possible values for omega(b_1), omega(b_2), ldots, omega(b_n), we can make omega(D) = max{omega(b_1), omega(b_2), ldots, omega(b_n)}, which also fulfills the problem condition. Hence: C^n leq a(n). 10. Combining these two bounds, we get: C^n leq a(n) leq C^{n+1}. 11.

Now, if the bus includes stoppages and still travels at an average speed of 16 km/hr, it would cover only 16 km in 1 hour.

This implies, for sufficiently large (k), (k(k+1)) must also have an even number of prime factors; however, this is impossible since consecutive integers (k) and (k+1) cannot both have the same parity of the number of prime factors due to their gcd being 1. 4. **Absurdity:** Since assuming (a ne b) leads to the contradiction that (P(n)) for all (n > 0) cannot consistently be joli, our assumption must be false. 5. **Conclusion:** Hence, (a = b). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A factory produces three different models of products, A, B, and C, with a ratio of their quantities being 2:5:3.

This is because for any x, y in mathbb{R}, we have a^{x+y}=a^x cdot a^y, which aligns with the given property ②. Since f(x) is also an increasing function (property ①), we deduce that a>1 to ensure the function increases.

Therefore, we have: f(x)=2^x **For the 2nd blank:** Given the proposition is false, i.e., there does not exist x>0 such that f(x)+2x+a<0, it implies the opposite proposition is true: for all x>0, f(x)+2x+a geqslant 0 must hold.

To find the range of a, we analyze the function y=-2^x-2x (which is the negative of the left-hand side of the inequality without a). Since y is a decreasing function for x>0 (because the derivative of -2^x-2x with respect to x is negative), we evaluate it at x=0 to find its maximum value in the domain x>0. We get y=-2^0-2cdot0=-1.

Substituting x = a+1 into f(x) gives: f(a+1) = frac{2(a+1)-a}{(a+2)^{2}} = frac{a+2-a}{(a+2)^{2}} = frac{1}{(a+2)^{2}}. Since a < -2, a+2 < 0, thus frac{1}{(a+2)^{2}} < 0 is not correct.

Total milk after adding = initial 30,000 gallons + 10,500 gallons added = 40,500 gallons However, there were only 28,980 gallons left in the storage tank. This means that the difference between the total milk after adding and the milk left in the storage tank is the amount of milk that was pumped into the milk tanker. Milk pumped into the tanker = Total milk after adding - Milk left in storage tank Milk pumped into the tanker = 40,500 gallons - 28,980 gallons = 11,520 gallons This pumping into the tanker took place over a period of 4 hours. To find the rate at which the milk was pumped into the tanker, we divide the total amount of milk pumped by the time it took.

These bisectors intersect at points that form a parallelogram due to the symmetry and equal distances involved. 2. **Parallelism Condition**: Given XY parallel BC, we need to show that the orthocenter of triangle XOY is the midpoint of IO. 3. **Proportionality**: By extending the perpendicular lines from A to BC and using the Law of Sines, we find that the ratio frac{AB'}{AC'} = frac{cos(angle B)}{cos(angle C)}. 4. **Intersection Points**: Let the perpendicular bisector of AH intersect the perpendicular bisector of AK at Z. By proportionality, frac{ZX}{ZY} = frac{cos(angle C)}{cos(angle B)}. 5. **Midpoint Condition**: If theta = angle (M(A,K))ZY, then frac{cos(angle C)}{cos(angle B)} = frac{ZX}{ZY} = frac{1/2 sin(theta) CK}{1/2 sin(theta) BH} = frac{CI}{BI} frac{cos(angle C)}{cos(angle B)}.

The projection of the midpoint of AB onto AC has a distance frac{c cos(angle A)}{2} + a cos(angle C) from C. 7. **Identity**: Using the identity a cos(angle C) + c cos(angle A) = b, we know these values are the same.

Observe that (sqrt{x^3 - 18x - 5} + 2) is non-negative for all real values of (x) because a square root is always non-negative, and adding 2 ensures it is strictly greater than or equal to 2. Thus, it can never be 0 or negative. 3. Since (sqrt{x^3 - 18x - 5} + 2 > 0) for all real (x), the product ((sqrt{x^3 - 18x - 5} + 2) cdot |x^3 - 4x^2 - 5x + 18|) will be non-negative or positive unless (|x^3 - 4x^2 - 5x + 18| = 0).

Because overline{AM} is a fixed chord on odot(AYZ), we see that R_A is minimized when overline{AM} is a diameter of odot(AYZ), in which case angle AYM = angle AZM = 90^circ. Thus, Y, Z are just the projections of M onto AC, AB, respectively. Meanwhile, measuredangle MXB = measuredangle MYB = 90^circ, implying that X is the projection of M onto BC. Hence, triangle A_2B_2C_2 is the pedal triangle of M with respect to triangle ABC, and it follows that triangle A_2B_2C_2 and triangle ABC are orthologic, as desired. 5. **Conclusion:** It follows from a well-known property of isogonal conjugates that the perpendiculars from A, B, C to B_2C_2, C_2A_2, A_2B_2, respectively, concur at the isogonal conjugate of M with respect to triangle ABC.

Hence: [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + cdots + x_n^2 = ab. ] 4. **Expression in terms of (a) and (b)**: - Represent each (x_k) (for (k = 1, 2, ldots, n)) as a combination of (a) and (b). We write: [ x_k = p_k a + q_k b, ] where (p_k) and (q_k) are rational coefficients since the system primarily involves linear equations with integer coefficients. 5. **Substitute in the area equation**: - Replace (x_k) expressions into the area equation: [ (p_1 a + q_1 b)^2 + (p_2 a + q_2 b)^2 + cdots + (p_n a + q_n b)^2 = ab. ] 6. **Expand and Simplify**: - Expanding the squares and grouping terms involving (a^2), (b^2), and (ab): [ sum_{k=1}^n (p_k^2 a^2 + 2 p_k q_k ab + q_k^2 b^2) = ab. ] This yields: [ left(sum_{k=1}^n p_k^2right) a^2 + left(2 sum_{k=1}^n p_k q_kright) ab + left(sum_{k=1}^n q_k^2right) b^2 = ab. ] 7. **Setup an Equation**: - Equate coefficients of corresponding powers of (a) and (b): [ sum_{k=1}^n p_k^2 a^2 + 2 sum_{k=1}^n p_k q_k ab + sum_{k=1}^n q_k^2 b^2 = ab. ] 8. **Rational Coefficients**: - The left-hand side contains terms (a^2, ab), and (b^2), each with rational coefficients. However, the right-hand side has only (ab), making it: [ P a^2 + R ab + Q b^2 = ab, ] where (P, R,) and (Q) are rational. 9. **Implies Rational Ratio**: - For this equation to hold, the coefficients of (a^2) and (b^2) must be zero since the left-hand side and the right-hand side must balance: [ P = sum_{k=1}^n p_k^2 = 0, quad Q = sum_{k=1}^n q_k^2 = 0. ] - The problem now becomes one in which all (p_k) and (q_k) must be zero, which contradicts the assumption that (p_k) and (q_k) are rational and the squares have positive side lengths depending on (a) or (b). 10. **Conclusion**: - The equation reduction shows that if (a) and (b) are incommensurable (the ratio (frac{a}{b}) is irrational), then no consistent positive solution (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) exists that satisfies the transformed area equation under rational coefficients. - Hence, a rectangle with incommensurable sides cannot be subdivided into squares.

Let's denote this angle by ( alpha ). 2. **Reflection Law and Geometry**: When the ball reflects off the sides of the polygon, it follows the law of reflection: the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Given that all the angles in the polygon are integer degrees, we analyze how the direction of the ball's path changes upon each reflection. 3. **Induction Hypothesis**: We will use induction to show that the angle the ball makes with the side ( AB ) after each reflection is of the form ( 2n^circ pm alpha ), where ( n ) is an integer. **Base Case**: Initially, the angle is ( alpha = 1^circ ). 4. **Inductive Step**: Suppose, after ( k ) reflections, the angle the ball makes with the side ( AB ) is ( 2n_k^circ pm alpha ) (where ( n_k ) is an integer). - Consider the reflection off a side ( XY ). The angle between ( AB ) and ( XY ) is ( theta ), which is an integer degree. - By reflecting off ( XY ), the ball now makes an angle with ( AB - 2theta ) (or ( AB + 2theta )). - Thus, the new angle is ( 2(n_k pm theta)^circ pm alpha ), still maintaining the form ( 2n_{k+1}^circ pm alpha ). 5. **Repeating Reflections**: After repeating several reflections, the angle the ball makes with ( AB ) will always be of the form ( 2n^circ pm alpha ).

Each segment connects a square from one part to a square in the other part. From any square, it is possible to move along the segments to reach any other square.

On each turn, a player moves their pawn to a connected square that isn't occupied. A player loses if they cannot move. The question asks whether there exists such a game board and initial pawn configuration where player A has a winning strategy. 1. **Claim:** There does not exist a game board and initial pawn configuration where player A (Paula) has a winning strategy. 2. **Proof:** - Let's construct a strategy ensuring player B (Laxman) can always win. - Define positions: Let (L) and (P) denote the initial squares of the purple pawn (l) and green pawn (p). 3. **Movement Path:** - According to the problem, a path exists from (L) to (P). Assume Laxman chooses a sequence of squares to follow: [ L = L_{1}, P_{1}, L_{2}, P_{2}, ldots, L_{n}, P_{n} = P. ] 4. **Move Strategy:** - Define ((A, B)) as the scenario where pawns (l) and (p) are in squares (A) and (B) respectively. - According to the strategy, if Laxman's pawn (l) is at (L_{i}), he moves it to (P_{i}). - If pawn (l) is at (P_{i}), he moves it to the next (L_{i+1}) square unless the square is at (P), then he moves it to (L_i). 5. **Finite Scenarios:** - The board has a finite number of configurations, ensuring the game concludes eventually. Hence, if Laxman follows the strategy correctly, Paula will eventually be unable to make a move and lose. 6. **Ensuring Laxman always has a move:** - If before a move, Laxman's (l) is at (L_i) or (P_i), then the configuration ( (L_i, X) ) or ( (P_i, X) ) must have been seen before where (X) is a different square from (P). - This ensures Laxman always has a next move per square configurations never being identical to avoid the cycle scenario. 7. **Conclusion:** - Given these arguments, Laxman (player B) always has a path to follow from available positions ensuring Paula (player A) runs out of moves first.

If a person needs to take this medication longterm, find the maximum value of m.","completion":"Let's break down the solution step-by-step, adhering to the format and rules provided: **Part (1)** For a_2: - We start with a_1 = m = 12 milligrams. - Since 80% of the medication is filtered out every 24 hours, 20% remains in the body. - So, the amount of medication after the second dose is a_2 = m + a_1 cdot 20%. - Substituting the values, we get a_2 = 12 + 12 times 0.2 = 12 + 2.4 = 14.4 milligrams. For a_3: - Similarly, for the third dose, a_3 = m + a_2 cdot 20%. - Substituting the values, we get a_3 = 12 + 14.4 times 0.2 = 12 + 2.88 = 14.88 milligrams. Hence, a_2 = 14.4 text{ and } a_3 = 14.88. **Part (2)** Given the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = m + frac{1}{5}a_n, we can rewrite it as: - a_{n+1} - frac{5}{4}m = frac{1}{5}(a_n - frac{5}{4}m). - With a_1 = m, we have a_1 - frac{5}{4}m = -frac{1}{4}m. This shows that {a_n - frac{5}{4}m} forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of frac{1}{5}. Thus: - a_n - frac{5}{4}m = -frac{1}{4}m times (frac{1}{5})^{n-1}. - Solving for a_n, we find a_n = frac{5}{4}m - frac{1}{4 times 5^{n-1}}m. To avoid toxic side effects, a_n leq 25 milligrams.

Since left{frac{5}{4} - frac{1}{4 times 5^{n-1}}right} is increasing and always less than frac{5}{4}, it implies: - frac{25}{frac{5}{4} - frac{1}{4 times 5^{n-1}}} > frac{25}{frac{5}{4}} = 20.

The relative speed of the two trains is the difference in their speeds because they are moving in the same direction. So, the relative speed is: 46 km/hr - 36 km/hr = 10 km/hr However, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to match the length unit of the trains, which is given in meters. We know that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 5/18 m/s. So, we convert 10 km/hr to m/s: 10 km/hr * (5/18) m/s/km/hr = (10 * 5/18) m/s = 50/18 m/s ≈ 2.78 m/s Now, since both trains are of equal length (50 meters), the total distance the faster train needs to cover to pass the slower train is the sum of their lengths: 50 meters + 50 meters = 100 meters Finally, we can calculate the time it takes for the faster train to pass the slower train by dividing the total distance by the relative speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 100 meters / 2.78 m/s ≈ 35.97 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{35.97} seconds for the faster train to pass the slower train."},{"prompt":"Find the value of x that satisfies frac{sqrt{4x+7}}{sqrt{8x+10}}=frac{sqrt{7}}{4}.

Substituting ( f(x) = x ) into the functional equation: [ f(2x + f(y)) = f(2x + y) ] Given ( f(x) = x ), we have: [ 2x + y = x + y + x ] This simplifies to: [ 2x + y = 2x + y ] 5. **Conclusion**: This is clearly true for all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ), confirming that ( f(x) = x ) is indeed a solution.

We can use the formula for exponential growth: Final Capacity = Initial Capacity * (2 ^ Number of Doublings) 7175 TB = 0.7 TB * (2 ^ Number of Doublings) To solve for the Number of Doublings, we divide both sides by 0.7 TB: (7175 TB) / (0.7 TB) = 2 ^ Number of Doublings 10250 = 2 ^ Number of Doublings Now we need to solve for the Number of Doublings.

Prove that if the total score of each player changed by at least n points, then it changed by exactly n points.","completion":"1. Let's begin by dividing the participants of the tournament into two groups: Group ( A ) and Group ( B ). Group ( A ) consists of the chess players who scored more points in the second tournament compared to the first one, whereas Group ( B ) consists of those who scored fewer points in the second tournament compared to the first one. 2. Let ( D ) denote the total increase in points for all players in Group ( A ). Similarly, the total decrease in points for all players in Group ( B ) will also be ( D ), as the overall points are conserved. 3. According to the problem, the sum of the changes in points for all players is at least ( n ). Therefore, we have: [ 2D geq 2n^2 ] 4. Note that the change in the result of a game between two players from the same group does not affect the sum ( 2D ). The reason is that if both players are in the same group (either ( A ) or ( B )), their individual changes cancel each other out. When two players from different groups play against each other, the change in the result contributes at most 2 points to ( 2D ) (in case one player in the first tournament wins and the other wins in the second tournament). 5. Let’s assume Group ( A ) consists of ( m ) players. The number of inter-group games played between the ( m ) players in Group ( A ) and ( 2n - m ) players in Group ( B ) is ( m(2n - m) ). Consequently, the following inequality holds: [ m(2n - m) leq n^2 ] 6. Given the initial inequality ( 2D geq 2n^2 ), and knowing ( 2D leq 2n^2 ) from the previous analysis, we can assert: [ 2D = 2n^2 ] 7.

Since (n > 1), the only possible value for (n) is (n = 2). Therefore, ((n, p) = (2, 2)) is a solution. 2. **Case: (p) is odd** Let (q) be the smallest prime divisor of (n) and let (o) be the order of (p-1 mod q). Since ((p-1)^{2n} equiv 1 mod q), we get (o mid 2n). By Fermat's Little Theorem, (o mid q-1). If (o) has a factor in common with (n), this factor would be (leq q-1 < q), which is impossible. Therefore, (o mid 2n) reduces to (o mid 2), yielding ((p-1)^2 equiv 1 mod q) or equivalently (q mid p(p-2)). - **Subcase: (q mid p-2)** We get ((p-1)^n + 1 equiv 1^n + 1 = 2 mod q). But we need (q) to divide this number, thus (q = 2). However, this implies (p) is even, so (p = 2), which we excluded in this case. - **Subcase: (q mid p)** We write (n = p^k s) where (p nmid s) and (k > 0). It is well known that for odd primes (p), if (v_p(a - b) > 0) and (p nmid a, b), then (v_p(a^t - b^t) = v_p(a - b) + v_p(t)) (where (v_p(m)) is the (p)-adic valuation of (m), the number of times (m) is divisible by (p)). With (a = p-1), (b = -1), and (t = n), this gives us (v_p((p-1)^n + 1) = k + 1) and it has to be (geq k(p-1)) to enable (p^{k(p-1)} mid n^{p-1} mid (p-1)^{p^k s} + 1). Now (k + 1 geq k(p-1) iff 2k + 1 geq kp iff 2 + frac{1}{k} geq p). Since we assumed (p geq 3), we have (k = 1) and (p = 3). If (s = 1), we have (n = 3) giving a solution. So let's assume (s > 1). Let (q) be the smallest prime divisor of (s). By (n = 3), we want (s mid 9s^2 = n^2 mid 2^n + 1 = 8^s + 1). Following the same idea as before, we take (o) as the order of (8 mod q) and get again (o mid 2) by the same argument. In both cases, (q mid 8^2 - 1 = 63), thus (q = 7).
