The circle w with diameter [AD] intersects AB at K and AC at L. 2. Denote M as the intersection of the tangents to the circle w at points K and L. 3. We need to prove that the ray [AM] is the A-median in triangle ABC. First, we establish that the quadrilateral AKRL is harmonic and that [AS] is the A-symmedian in triangle KAL. 4. Since AD is the diameter of the circle w, AD is perpendicular to BC at D. Therefore, AD is the altitude of triangle ABC. 5. The power of point A with respect to the circle w gives us: [ AK cdot AB = AD^2 = AL cdot AC ] This implies that AK cdot AB = AL cdot AC, meaning that the quadrilateral BKLC is cyclic. 6. Since BKLC is cyclic, we have: [ angle BKL = angle BCL quad text{and} quad angle KBL = angle KCL ] This implies that triangle AKL sim triangle ACB by AA similarity. 7. Now, consider the tangents from K and L to the circle w. Let S be the intersection of KL and AM, and R be the second intersection of AM with the circle w. 8. By the properties of harmonic division, the quadrilateral AKRL is harmonic. This means that the cross-ratio (A, S; R, M) is harmonic. 9. Since AKRL is harmonic, the ray [AS] is the A-symmedian in triangle KAL. This follows from the fact that the symmedian is the isogonal conjugate of the median in a triangle. 10. Given that triangle AKL sim triangle ACB and [AS] is the A-symmedian in triangle KAL, it follows that [AM] is the A-median in triangle ABC.

We aim to transform the grid so all a_{ij} = 0 using the operations allowed (subtract one from each entry in a column or double each entry in a row). 2. **Understand the Operations:** - **Operation 1: Subtract 1 from every entry in a selected column.** - **Operation 2: Double every entry in a selected row.** 3. **Goal:** Transform the entire grid so every cell value becomes zero. 4. **Strategy to Clear Columns:** - Focus initially on the first column: - If the first column contains any entries equal to 1, we apply Operation 2 (double the entire row) to all rows intersecting the first column with a value of 1. This transforms those intersecting entries into even numbers. - Apply Operation 1 to the first column until all entries are 0 since even numbers can decrement evenly to zero using this operation. 5. **Example Execution for a single column:** - Suppose the first column initially has values [1, k, 3, m, 0, 4, 2, n]. - Double the rows where the first column has 1s: - For instance, if 1 is in position (1,1), doubling this row transforms a_{1j} to 2a_{1j}. - The new first column might now look something like [2, k', 6, m', 0, 8, 4, n'] with all other values adjusted. - Now, decrement through subtraction in the first column: After each column-wise subtraction: - [1, k'-1, 5, m'-1, 0, 7, 3, n'-1] - Repeat until first column values: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. 6. **Eradicate Values in Subsequent Columns:** Once the first column is set to zero, repeat the process for each subsequent column: - Treat each remaining column in isolation: For column j (where j in {2,3,...,8}), use the same idea: - Apply Operation 2 to rows intersecting j^{th} column having non-zero values until all are even. - Use Operation 1 to reduce the entire j^{th} column to zeros. 7. **Ensuring Other Columns Aren't Affected Negatively:** Because Operations 2 (doubling rows) and 1 (subtracting from columns) are limited to their respective axes, zeros generated in previously solved columns or rows remain zero. 8. **Conclusion:** By systematically clearing each column, starting from the first to the eighth without disturbing previously zero-ed columns' integrity, the entire grid can be transformed into a zero grid. Therefore, by repeating the described operations, it is possible to clear the entire chessboard of checkers. boxed{text{Yes}}"},{"prompt":"The Twelvetone Equal Temperament is a universally applied musical temperament system.

Thus, we can express the parabola as y=a(x+1)(x-2).

Given that CD is a chord of constant length, and noting that AB is the diameter of the circle, the intercepted arc overparen{CD} remains constant as CD changes position on the circle. 2.

Given that the point (1, frac {3}{2}) lies on the ellipse, we have frac {1}{4c^{2}} + frac {(frac {3}{2})^2}{3c^{2}} = 1. Solving for c^2 gives us c^2 = 1.

Prove that there are two points ( X ) and ( Y ) on ( L ) such that the distance between them is at most 1, and the distance between them along the curve ( L ) is at least 198.

Suppose that for any point ( P ) on the boundary of ( S ), there exists a point on ( L ) such that the distance between ( P ) and this point on ( L ) is not greater than ( frac{1}{2} ). We need to show that there exist two points ( X ) and ( Y ) on ( L ) such that the distance between ( X ) and ( Y ) is not greater than 1 and the distance between ( X ) and ( Y ) along ( L ) is not less than 198. 1. **Define Points:** According to the problem's conditions, for each of the 4 vertices of the square ( S ), denoted by ( B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, ) and ( B_{4} ), there exist points ( C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}, ) and ( C_{4} ) on ( L ) respectively such that: [ d(B_{i}, C_{i}) leq frac{1}{2}, quad text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4. ] 2. **Order along ( L ):** Without loss of generality, assume that while traveling along ( L ) from ( A_{0} ) to ( A_{n} ), you encounter ( C_{1} ) first. Also, assume that among ( C_{2} ) and ( C_{4} ), you encounter ( C_{2} ) first while considering the path from ( C_{1} ). 3. **Classify Boundaries:** Consider the boundary segment ( B_{1}B_{4} ). For any point ( P ) on ( B_{1}B_{4} ), the polygonal line ( L ) contains a point ( Q ) such that ( d(P, Q) leq frac{1}{2} ). Depending on the location of ( Q ), classify these points into two categories: - Category 1: ( Q ) lies on the segment ( A_{0}C_{2} ). - Category 2: ( Q ) lies on the segment ( C_{2}A_{n} ). Clearly, ( B_{1} ) lies in Category 1, and ( B_{4} ) lies in Category 2. Therefore, both categories contain at least one point. 4. **Existence of Common Points:** Due to the above classifications, we can conclude that there must be a common point ( P_{0} ) in both categories. This common point is such that there exist points ( Q_{1} ) on ( A_{0}C_{2} ) and ( Q_{2} ) on ( C_{2}A_{n} ) satisfying: [ d(P_{0}, Q_{1}) leq frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad d(P_{0}, Q_{2}) leq frac{1}{2}. ] Thus, [ d(Q_{1}, Q_{2}) leq d(P_{0}, Q_{1}) + d(P_{0}, Q_{2}) = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1. ] 5. **Analyzing Distances Along ( L ):** Consider the straight-line distance along ( L ) between ( Q_{1} ) and ( Q_{2} ): [ d(Q_{1}, C_{2}) + d(C_{2}, Q_{2}) ] Evidently, the shortest possible path along the boundary should be at least: [ d(Q_{1}, C_{2}) geq 100 - frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} = 99, ] and similarly for ( d(C_{2}, Q_{2}) geq 99 ). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the distance along ( L ) between ( Q_{1} ) and ( Q_{2} ), following ( C_{2} ), must satisfy: [ d_{text{along } L}(Q_{1}, Q_{2}) geq 99 + 99 = 198. ] The points ( X ) and ( Y ) meeting the conditions of the problem are thus ( Q_{1} ) and ( Q_{2} ).

So we can set up the equation: ( x - 50 - frac{1}{3}(x - 50) + 200 = 300 ) First, let's simplify the equation by distributing the ( frac{1}{3} ) into ( (x - 50) ): ( x - 50 - frac{1}{3}x + frac{50}{3} + 200 = 300 ) Combine like terms: ( x - frac{1}{3}x = 300 - 200 + 50 - frac{50}{3} ) ( frac{2}{3}x = 150 - frac{50}{3} ) To combine the right side of the equation, we need a common denominator, which is 3: ( frac{2}{3}x = frac{450}{3} - frac{50}{3} ) ( frac{2}{3}x = frac{400}{3} ) Now, multiply both sides by ( frac{3}{2} ) to solve for ( x ): ( x = frac{400}{3} times frac{3}{2} ) ( x = frac{400 times 3}{3 times 2} ) The 3s cancel out: ( x = frac{400}{2} ) ( x = 200 ) So, initially, Steve had boxed{200} fish in stock."},{"prompt":"Kolya had 10 sheets of paper.

We need to find the total number of sheets after (k) steps, when it first exceeds 500. 5. Initially, there are 10 sheets. After (k) steps, the total number of sheets can be expressed as: [ 10 + sum_{i=1}^{k} i = 10 + frac{k(k + 1)}{2} ] Here, (sum_{i=1}^{k} i = frac{k(k + 1)}{2}) is the sum of the first (k) natural numbers. 6.

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction: [ k(k + 1) > 980 ] 9. This is a quadratic inequality. To solve this, we solve the equation: [ k(k + 1) = 980 ] 10.

Estimating (sqrt{3921} approx 62.6), we use: [ k = frac{-1 + 62.6}{2} approx 30.8 ] 12. Since (k) must be an integer, we test (k = 30) and (k = 31): - For (k = 30): [ 10 + frac{30(30 + 1)}{2} = 10 + frac{30 times 31}{2} = 10 + 465 = 475 ] This is less than 500. - For (k = 31): [ 10 + frac{31(31 + 1)}{2} = 10 + frac{31 times 32}{2} = 10 + 496 = 506 ] This is greater than 500. 13.

If the number is not a, assign it to a number different than both P and Q. - If P and Q have different numbers, say a and b, then R must be labeled with c, where c is distinct from a and b. 4. **Sum of numbers in a triangle:** In either case, the sum of the numbers at the vertices of triangle PQR will be divisible by 3: - If all numbers are the same, the sum is 3a equiv 0 mod 3. - If the numbers are distinct, their sum is 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 equiv 0 mod 3. Therefore, at every step, if we proceed with the coloring process (or labelling with numbers), the sum of unattached/uncolored nodes remains consistently 2 mod 3. 5. **Analyzing the last uncolored node:** - If all nodes except one are colored, sum of all colored nodes = 2 mod 3. - Then the sum of all nodes remains 2 mod 3 by our numbering rule. Since the number 0 or 1 was used initially in the hexagon, the final node (left uncolored and unused in any triangle sums) must neither affect nor complete any previously formed sums. Hence it must be neither 0 nor 1, which implies it cannot be an original hexagonal vertex (0 or 1). # Conclusion: The last uncolored node will therefore always be such that it is not among the original vertices of the hexagon. Therefore, if exactly one node remains uncolored, it cannot be a vertex of the original hexagon. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Martha needs to paint all four walls in her kitchen, which has 12 feet length, a certain width, and 10 foot high ceilings.

Considering the expression of P(x) from the Lagrange interpolation formula, the leading term with coefficient 1 should correspond to the sum of the leading terms of each Lagrange basis polynomial.

The leading term of the polynomial P(x), which is x^n, can be approximated by analyzing the contributions from left| sum_{j=0}^{n} P(x_j) prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leq i leq n}} frac{1}{x_j - x_i} right|.

For (0 leq j leq n): [ prod_{substack{i neq j 0 leq i leq j}} frac{1}{x_j - x_i} cdot prod_{substack{i neq j j < i leq n}} frac{1}{x_j - x_i} ] Since (x_0 < x_1 < cdots < x_n), each (frac{1}{x_j - x_i} > 0), and the products result in values (leq frac{1}{prod_{i=0}^{j} (j - i)} cdot frac{1}{prod_{i=j+1}^{n} (i - j)}). 7.

Each of these cases can be analyzed similarly, yielding the same number of sequences (10) as the process is repetitive based on the symmetrical property of the facing numbers: - Each case matches with (2 + 4 + 4 = 10) sequences. - **Case 3: Second number is 4** - This mirrors the previous configurations and provides the same counts. - Each case matches with (2 + 4 + 4 = 10) sequences. - **Case 4: Second number is 5** - This mirrors the previous configurations and provides the same counts. - Each case matches with (2 + 4 + 4 = 10) sequences. 3. **Conclusion** Therefore, summing up all the cases: (10 text{ (when second number is 2)} + 10 text{ (when second number is 3)} + 10 text{ (when second number is 4)} + 10 text{ (when second number is 5)} = 40).

We can set up two equations based on this information: Equation 1 (total cost): 1.00S + 1.50D = 64.50 Equation 2 (total number of burgers): S + D = 50 We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of S and D.

According to the problem, the number is considered \\"lucky\\" if: [ a + b + c = d + e + f ] and all six digits are different. 2. **Count the Total Number of Lucky Numbers:** Since the digits must be different, we need to count the permutations of the digits such that the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits. The total number of permutations of six digits is ( 6! = 720 ). However, we need to ensure that the sums of the first three and the last three digits are equal. 3. **Calculate the Sum of All Lucky Numbers:** Consider the sum of all possible lucky numbers. Each digit can appear in any of the six positions, and for each valid combination of ( a, b, c ) and ( d, e, f ), there are ( 3! times 3! = 36 ) permutations.

(49th Moscow Mathematical Olympiad, 1986)","completion":"To demonstrate that from these 48 natural numbers, we can select 4 numbers such that their product is a perfect square, let's follow these steps: 1. **Factorization of Numbers**: Given 48 natural numbers and that the product of these numbers involves exactly 10 distinct prime factors. We denote any pair of numbers (a, b) specifically as products of their prime factors: [ a = 2^{e_1} cdot 3^{e_2} cdot 5^{e_3} cdot ldots cdot 19^{e_{10}} ] [ b = 2^{f_1} cdot 3^{f_2} cdot 5^{f_3} cdot ldots cdot 19^{f_{10}} ] 2. **Prime Factor Structure**: The product (a cdot b) can be written as: [ a cdot b = 2^{e_1+f_1} cdot 3^{e_2+f_2} cdot 5^{e_3+f_3} cdot ldots cdot 19^{e_{10}+f_{10}} ] For the product (a cdot b) to be a perfect square, all exponents in the prime factorization must be even.

The angle bisectors of (angle BOC) intersect at point (O). We know from properties of the angle bisector in a triangle that: [ widehat{BOC} = 90^circ + frac{1}{2}widehat{A} ] 5. By angle sum property of the triangle: [ widehat{BOC} = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(widehat{B} + widehat{C}) ] Since the sum of angles in triangle ABC is (180^circ): [ widehat{BOC} = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(180^circ - widehat{A}) = 180^circ - 90^circ + frac{1}{2}widehat{A} = 90^circ + frac{1}{2}widehat{A} ] This confirms that (widehat{BOC} = 90^circ + frac{1}{2}widehat{A}). 6. Since (widehat{BO_1A} = widehat{BO_{4}A}) (both involving the angle (widehat{A}), the quadrilateral (ABO_1O_4) is cyclic. 7. Consequently, the external angle (widehat{BO_1O_4}) can be expressed as: [ widehat{BO_1O_4} = widehat{BAO_4} = frac{1}{2}widehat{BAD} ] 8. Similarly, examining triangles involving the other points, i.e., (B, C, D,) we find that each external angle involving an (O_i) in a cyclic quadrilateral follows similar rules.

A: 4 B: 5 C: 6 D: 7","completion":"Since a and b are the roots of the function f(x) = x^2 - px + q, we get a + b = p and ab = q. Since p > 0 and q > 0, it follows that a > 0 and b > 0. Considering that a, b, and -2 can be arranged to form both an arithmetic and a geometric sequence, we have either an arithmetic sequence a, -2, b or b, -2, a and a geometric sequence a, -2, b or b, -2, a. This gives us two possibilities: 1. If they form a geometric sequence in the order a, -2, b, then: left( -2 right)^2 = ab quad Rightarrow quad ab = 4. 2. If they form an arithmetic sequence in the order a, -2, b, then: -2 - a = b - (-2) quad Rightarrow quad 2b = a + 2. Either way, solving these simultaneous equations yields: begin{align*} a + b &= p, ab &= 4. end{align*} From the equation 2b = a + 2, we can find the individual values of a and b. Substituting ab = 4 into 2b = a + 2 and solving for a and b gives us: begin{align*} a &= frac{4}{b}, frac{8}{b} &= b + 2, b^2 + 2b - 8 &= 0. end{align*} Solving the quadratic equation, we find the possible values for b: b = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 4 cdot 8}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 6}{2}. Taking the positive root because b must be positive, b = 2. This gives us a = 2 as well, but since a and b are distinct, we need to consider the negative root, thus b = -4 is not valid. Instead, we substitute b = 2 into ab = 4 and solve for a: a = frac{4}{b} = 2. Since both a and b cannot be equal, our initial approach must be incorrect. We consider the other possible arrangement for the arithmetic sequence, where if they form an arithmetic sequence in the order b, -2, a, then: -2 - b = a - (-2) quad Rightarrow quad 2a = b + 2. Now, solving for a and b with a > 0, b > 0, and ab = 4, we get: a = frac{b + 2}{2} = frac{4}{b}. Thus: b + 2 = frac{8}{b} quad Rightarrow quad b^2 + 2b - 8 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation we find: (b - 2)(b + 4) = 0. As b > 0, this gives b = 2 and consequently a = 4. Therefore: a + b = 4 + 2 = boxed{6}. However, since one of the criteria for the roots is that a + b = p and p > 0, let's check if our answer a + b = 6 is greater than zero: a + b = 6 quad > quad 0. Indeed it is, which means 6 should be one of our possible answers. But we do not have this option in our choices A, B, C, D. Let's reevaluate to make sure. Consider the other arithmetic sequence possibility: if a or b are placed in the middle (to match with the term -2), then the sequences could be: b, a, -2 or a, b, -2. In this case, we have: b - a = a - (-2) quad Rightarrow quad 2a = b + 2, a - b = b - (-2) quad Rightarrow quad 2b = a + 2. Choosing 2b = a + 2 (since it leads to distinct roots) and combining with ab = 4, we have: 2b = frac{4}{b} + 2 quad Rightarrow quad 2b^2 = 4 + 2b, which simplifies to: b^2 - b - 2 = 0. The factorization of this equation gives us: (b - 2)(b + 1) = 0, so b = 2 (since b cannot be negative). Substituting b = 2 into ab = 4, we get: a = frac{4}{2} = 2. But, since a and b cannot be the same, we discard the a = b solution and we have made an error in our assumption. Let's try another approach with the correct arithmetic sequence b - a = a - (-2): 2a = b + 2 quad Rightarrow quad a = frac{b + 2}{2}. Substituting this result into ab = 4, we get: frac{b + 2}{2} cdot b = 4 quad Rightarrow quad b^2 + 2b = 8 quad Rightarrow quad b^2 + 2b - 8 = 0, which factors to: (b - 2)(b + 4) = 0. Since b must be positive, b = 2 and so a = 4 - b = 4 - 2 = 2. This again results in a and b being equal, which violates the distinct roots condition. Therefore, the possible arrangement of them being arithmetic sequence in the order a, b, -2 or b, a, -2 cannot happen. Since we're dealing with positive roots and numbers being able to form both an arithmetic and a geometric sequence, the correct configuration is indeed that a, -2, b form a geometric sequence and either a, b, -2 or b, a, -2 form an arithmetic sequence. From the geometric sequence, we have ab = 4, and for the arithmetic sequence, we use 2b = a + 2. Let's solve for a and b using this correct system of equations: a + b = p, quad ab = 4, quad 2b = a + 2. From the arithmetic sequence, replacing 2b with a + 2, we can express a in terms of b: a = 2b - 2. Substituting into the geometric sequence condition ab = 4, we get: (2b - 2)b = 4 quad Rightarrow quad 2b^2 - 2b - 4 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad b^2 - b - 2 = 0. This quadratic equation now factors as: (b - 2)(b + 1) = 0. From the positive root, b = 2, and so substituting into a = 2b - 2 gives us a = 2 cdot 2 - 2 = 2. However, this results in a equalling b, which is not possible because they are distinct roots. For the negative root, b = -1, since our assumption requires that b is positive, this root is not valid. Finally, considering all the possibilities, we realize that the roots of the arithmetic sequence form -2, a, b or -2, b, a, and the roots of the geometric sequence form a, -2, b or b, -2, a. Let's rearrange the geometric sequence condition to yield the right roots: left( -2 right)^2 = ab quad Rightarrow quad ab = 4, and the arithmetic sequence condition to match: a - (-2) = b - a quad Rightarrow quad 2a = b + 2 quad Rightarrow a = frac{b + 2}{2}. Substituting the expression for a into the equation ab = 4, we get: frac{b + 2}{2} cdot b = 4 quad Rightarrow quad b^2 + 2b - 8 = 0. This quadratic equation factors to give: (b - 2)(b + 4) = 0. We select the positive root b = 2 and substitute it back into the equation for a: a = frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2. However, since a = b is not possible, we return to the quadratic equation and realize we used the wrong root. If b neq 2, then we cannot have the correct arithmetic sequence with -2 as the middle term. Thus, the correct use of our original factors (b - 2)(b + 4) = 0 reveals that the only remaining solution is b = 2 (since b + 4 = 0 provides a negative value for b which is not possible). Therefore: a = frac{4}{b} = frac{4}{2} = 2, , b = 2. Once more, we have found a = b, so we must have committed an error. Upon careful re-examination, let's solve the equations: a + b = p, quad ab = 4. From the equations for the arithmetic sequence: a - (-2) = b - a quad text{or} quad b - (-2) = a - b, we find: 2a + 2 = b quad text{or} quad 2b + 2 = a. By substituting b = 2a + 2 into ab = 4: a(2a + 2) = 4 quad Rightarrow quad 2a^2 + 2a - 4 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad a^2 + a - 2 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find: a = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} quad Rightarrow quad a = frac{-1 pm 3}{2}. We disregard the negative root because the roots must be positive. This gives us a = 1. Substituting a = 1 into the equation b = 2a + 2 results in: b = 2 cdot 1 + 2 = 4. Thus, we finally arrive at a = 1 and b = 4. Therefore, the sum of the roots is: a + b = 1 + 4 = boxed{5}."},{"prompt":", b and c have rs . 300 between them , a and c together have rs . 200 and b and c rs . 350 . how much does c have ?","completion":"Let's denote the amount of money that A has as A, the amount that B has as B, and the amount that C has as C.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Tournament Setup:** Organize the tournament such that all 25 players compete in matches following the single-elimination format (Olympic system). 2. **Initial Rounds Analysis:** - In the first round, 25 players compete. Thus, 12 pairs play, and 1 player receives a bye: [ 12 text{ matches} ] - In the second round, the 13 winners play 6 pairs, with 1 player receiving a bye: [ 6 text{ matches} ] - In the third round, the 7 winners play 3 pairs, with 1 player receiving a bye: [ 3 text{ matches} ] - In the fourth round, the 4 winners play 2 pairs: [ 2 text{ matches} ] - In the fifth round, the 2 winners play 1 pair: [ 1 text{ match} ] 3. **Total Matches for Identifying the Strongest Player:** - Summing all the matches played in the rounds: [ 12 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 24 text{ matches} ] 4. **Determine the Second Strongest Player:** - The 24 matches help us identify the strongest player but not the second strongest. Each loss narrows down the field, leaving us with the top player. 5. **Identifying the Competitors for the Second Strongest Position:** - The remaining potential candidates for second place are the ones defeated by the champion. - Each defeated player could have been progressively weaker, so they did not face each other. 6. **Conduct Another Mini-Tournament among Defeated Players:** - The champion played 5 matches (because ( log_2(25) approx 5 )). - Conduct another sub-tournament among the (5) strongest players who were defeated by the champion: - To find the second strongest from these, up to 4 extra matches are necessary (single-elimination among (5) players: 2 matches for initial 4, 1 match for the (2) winners, totalling 3, plus 1 bye). 7. **Total Matches Including Sub-Tournament:** - Summing up all matches: [ 24 text{ initial matches} + 4 text{ additional matches} = 28 text{ matches} ] Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of matches required to determine the top two players in a 25-player chess tournament is: [ boxed{28} ]"},{"prompt":"the central cell of a 21 times 21 board, there is a piece.

This contradiction would favor the scenario of exactly two counterfeit coins being correct. - **Case 2:** The balance is not in equilibrium (( A + B neq C + D )). - Since counterfeit coins are lighter, let's assume ( A + B < C + D ), meaning: - At least one of ( A ) or ( B ) is counterfeit and at least one of ( C ) or ( D ) is genuine, or vice-versa. - Kolya should then pick one coin from each pan, such as ( A ) from the lighter pan and ( D ) from the heavier pan, to compare: - Place ( A ) on the left pan and ( C ) on the right pan. - If the balance tips, then one is counterfeit – compliance with being lighter guides towards the exact number of two counterfeits hypothesized. - If the balance remains, the exact balance in the previous case assured it. In all scenarios, Kolya can conclusively determine if there are exactly two counterfeit coins.

He got 25 back as change from a 50 bill, so he spent 50 - 25 = 25. Now, let's calculate the cost of the pens. He bought 3 pens for 1 each, so the pens cost 3 * 1 = 3. Next, we know that he bought 4 notebooks and 2 folders for 5 each. So the cost of the folders is 2 * 5 = 10. Now, let's subtract the cost of the pens and folders from the total amount spent to find the cost of the notebooks. 25 (total spent) - 3 (pens) - 10 (folders) = 12.

Let the number of arithmetic sequences be n, with their common differences denoted as d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{n}. Since the sequences are monotonically increasing, the differences d_{i} are non-negative and, since the reciprocals exist, the differences must be positive. 2. Let N be a positive integer. We will estimate how many integers from the set {1, 2, ldots, N} can be contained in each sequence. Suppose the k-th sequence contains h_{k} integers from this set. The difference between the largest and smallest values in this subset is at most N - 1. Additionally, because we are dealing with an arithmetic sequence with difference d_{k}, this difference must be at least (h_{k} - 1) d_{k}. Hence, [ (h_{k} - 1) d_{k} leq N - 1 < N ] 3. This inequality can be rearranged to give: [ h_{k} < frac{N}{d_{k}} + 1 ] 4. Summing this over all k from 1 to n, we get: [ h_{1} + h_{2} + cdots + h_{n} < left(frac{N}{d_{1}} + 1right) + left(frac{N}{d_{2}} + 1right) + cdots + left(frac{N}{d_{n}} + 1right) ] 5.

Factoring out N on the right-hand side, we have: [ h_{1} + h_{2} + cdots + h_{n} < N left(frac{1}{d_{1}} + frac{1}{d_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{d_{n}}right) + n ] 7. Let S=frac{1}{d_{1}} + frac{1}{d_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{d_{n}}. Given that the sum S is less than 1, [ h_{1} + h_{2} + cdots + h_{n} < N S + n ] 8. Subtracting this sum from N gives a lower bound on the number of integers in {1, 2, ldots, N} that are not in any of the sequences: [ N - left(h_{1} + h_{2} + cdots + h_{n}right) > N - (N S + n) ] Simplifying, [ N - (N S + n) = N (1 - S) - n ] 9. Since 1 - S is positive and n is a constant, this number can be arbitrarily large for sufficiently large N. # Conclusion: Thus, there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not contained in any of the given sequences. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"(a) Let ( n ) be a positive integer.

Thus, when x=50, W achieves the maximum value of 800 ten thousand yuan. For 60leqslant xleqslant 70, W can be expressed as: W = -x^2 + 110x - 2400 = -(x-55)^2 + 625. Since W decreases as x increases past 55, the maximum for this interval occurs at x=60. At this price, the maximum profit is 600 = -(60-55)^2 + 625 ten thousand yuan. Because 800 > 600, we can conclude that the maximum annual profit is when x=50, and the maximum profit is boxed{800} ten thousand yuan.

For 60leqslant xleqslant 70, since the maximum profit is 600 ten thousand yuan, which is less than 750 ten thousand yuan, there are no values in this interval that satisfy the requirement.

The second term can be rewritten using the identity cosleft(theta + frac{pi}{2}right) = -sintheta, but since we have a +frac{3pi}{2}, it becomes sin(theta) due to the periodicity and symmetry of sine and cosine functions. Thus, we have: [ f(x) = 2cosomega x + 2sqrt{3}sinomega x ] Using the sine addition formula, sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B, we can express f(x) as a single sine function. We recognize that cosomega x and sinomega x can be components of a sine function with a phase shift. The coefficients 2 and 2sqrt{3} suggest using the sine of an angle that corresponds to these coefficients when decomposed into cosine and sine components. Specifically, we use sinleft(omega x + frac{pi}{6}right) because cosfrac{pi}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} and sinfrac{pi}{6} = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, we have: [ f(x) = 4sinleft(omega x + frac{pi}{6}right) ] 2. **Analyzing the range of f(x) and the condition f(m)f(n) = 16:** The function f(x) = 4sinleft(omega x + frac{pi}{6}right) has a maximum value of 4 and a minimum value of -4 because the sine function ranges from -1 to 1, and it is multiplied by 4. For f(m)f(n) = 16 to hold, both f(m) and f(n) must be at these extremal values, either both 4 or both -4. 3. **Determining the minimum value of omega:** Given that there must exist at least two distinct real numbers m and n in the interval [lambda, lambda +3] such that f(m)f(n)=16, we understand that the function must complete a full cycle within this interval to hit both its maximum and minimum. The period T of f(x) is frac{2pi}{omega}, and for a full cycle, we consider frac{3T}{2} = frac{3pi}{omega} leqslant 3. Solving this inequality for omega gives: [ omega geqslant pi ] Since omega is a natural number, the smallest natural number greater than or equal to pi is 4.

Let a be the larger of the two numbers. 2. **Considering classes with 0**: Let’s look at the class that contains 0. If either a or b were in the other class, they would not have the desired property (since 0+a=a and 0+b=b). Thus, a and b must be in the class containing 0. 3. **Subsequent deductions**: Similarly, if x is in this class, then (b-x)(mod p) and (a-(b-x))(mod p) must also be in this class. Setting x=a-b, we deduce that 2(a-b)(mod p) is in the class containing 0. Similarly, applying x=2(a-b)(mod p), we get 3(a-b)(mod p) is in the same class, and continuing this process yields: [ 0, quad (a-b), quad 2(a-b)(mod p), quad 3(a-b)(mod p), quad ldots, quad (p-1) cdot (a-b)(mod p) ] all belong to the same class. 4. **Distinct elements**: We show these p numbers are all distinct. For any 0 leq k < l leq p-1: [ k(a-b)(mod p) = l(a-b)(mod p) ] implies that p divides (k-l)(a-b), which is impossible because 0 < |k-l| < p and 0 < |a-b| < p. 5. **Contradiction**: Therefore, the class containing 0 must have exactly p elements, leaving the other class empty, which contradicts our conditions. Hence, at most one such number a can exist. (blacksquare) **Second Solution: Pairing and contradiction** 1. **Base case and assumptions**: The problem statement is trivially true for p=2. Hence, assume p is odd and let the two classes be A and B. Consider a number a such that neither a nor a+p can be represented as a sum of one element from A and one from B. 2. **Forming pairs**: For every integer 0 leq x leq p-1, exactly one 0 leq y leq p-1 exists such that either x+y=a or x+y=a+p. Hence, we can pair the numbers 0, 1, ldots, p-1. - The only exceptions are when x=y=frac{a}{2} or x=y=frac{a+p}{2}, but for a fixed a, only one of these can occur as either frac{a}{2} or frac{a+p}{2} is an integer. - Therefore, there are frac{p-1}{2} pairs. 3. **Sum condition for pairs**: Under the assumption, each pair must belong to the same class. If there are n_1 such pairs in A, then the remaining are in B. Summing elements in A gives n_1 a + kp, where 0 leq k leq n_1. - Repeating this for another such number b neq a, the sum in A would be n_1 b + lp, where again 0 leq l leq n_1. 4. **Contradiction**: Thus, we have: [ n_1(a - b) = (l - k)p ] Since a neq b and |a - b|< p, the fraction must imply that p mid n_1. However, given 0 < n_1 leq frac{p-1}{2}, this is impossible. Hence, n_1=0 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, at most one number a with these properties exists.

To prove that f(x) is an increasing function on (0, +∞), we need to find its derivative and show that it is greater than or equal to zero for all x > 0. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x(x + 1)^2} = frac{(x - 1)^2}{x(x + 1)^2} geq 0, since the square of any real number is always non-negative. The only time the derivative equals zero is when x = 1, making f(x) an increasing function everywhere on (0, +infty). (2) To determine the range for a, we analyze the behavior of f(x) when f(x) geq 0. First, we note that f(1) = 0 for any value of a. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = frac{x^2 + 2(1 - a)x + 1}{x(x + 1)^2}, for x > 0.

Thus, f(x) is an increasing function on (0, +infty), which satisfies the condition; (iii) When a > 2, the discriminant Delta = 4(a^2 - 2a) > 0, meaning f'(x) = 0 has two distinct real roots x_1 = a - 1 - sqrt{a^2 - 2a}, quad x_2 = a - 1 + sqrt{a^2 - 2a}, with 0 < x_1 < a-1 < x_2 (since a - 1 > 1). In this case, f(x) increases on (0, x_1] and [x_2, +infty), and decreases on (x_1, x_2). Since 1 belongs to the interval (x_1, x_2) where f(x) is decreasing and f(1) = 0, it does not meet the condition.

The balanced equation is: 2 NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O From the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4 to produce 2 moles of H2O. Given that 54 moles of H2O are formed, we can set up a proportion to find out how many moles of NaOH were needed: 2 moles of H2O are produced by 2 moles of NaOH 54 moles of H2O are produced by x moles of NaOH Using cross-multiplication, we get: 2 moles H2O / 2 moles NaOH = 54 moles H2O / x moles NaOH 2/2 * x = 54 x = 54 So, 54 moles of NaOH were combined to produce 54 moles of H2O. However, we must also consider the stoichiometry with respect to H2SO4. Since 3 moles of H2SO4 are available and the reaction requires 2 moles of NaOH for every 1 mole of H2SO4, we can calculate the maximum amount of H2O that can be produced from 3 moles of H2SO4: 1 mole H2SO4 → 2 moles H2O 3 moles H2SO4 → 3 * 2 moles H2O = 6 moles H2O Since the maximum amount of H2O that can be produced from 3 moles of H2SO4 is 6 moles, and we have 54 moles of H2O formed, it indicates that there is an excess of H2SO4 and the limiting reactant is NaOH.

This simplifies to: sin(A + C) = 2sin(B)cos(B). Using the identity sin(A + C) = sin(pi - B) = sin(B) and that sin(B) neq 0, we get: sin(B) = 2sin(B)cos(B). Dividing by sin(B): 1 = 2cos(B). Hence: cos(B) = frac{1}{2}. Since B is an angle of a triangle, it must be within the interval (0, pi), therefore: B = frac{pi}{3}. Then: A + C = pi - B = pi - frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3} = 2B.

The probability of not drawing a in one draw is 1 - frac{1}{n}, which equals 1 - frac{1}{8} since we have found n = 8. The probability of not drawing a in three sequential draws is: left(1 - frac{1}{8}right)^3 = left(frac{7}{8}right)^3 Therefore, the probability of drawing individual a at least once in the three draws is: 1 - left(frac{7}{8}right)^3 Let's calculate this probability: 1 - left(frac{7}{8}right)^3 = 1 - frac{343}{512} = frac{512 - 343}{512} = frac{169}{512} Now, converting frac{169}{512} to a fraction with a denominator of 8 to compare it with the given probability, we get: frac{169}{512} = frac{169 times 8}{512 times 8} = frac{1352}{4096} But since we are asking for a natural denominator, we shouldn't actually convert it.

Since we've already accounted for the total runs needed, we don't need to add these runs separately; we just need to ensure that at least 12 boundaries are hit during the course of scoring those 250 runs. Regarding wickets, the condition is that no more than 3 wickets fall. This is a condition on the wickets and does not directly affect the calculation of the run rate.

The volume V (in cubic centimeters) of the puddle can be calculated as: V = A * D Given that D = 30 cm (the depth of the puddle) and V is the volume of rainwater that filled the puddle, which is also the amount of rain that fell in 3 hours (30 cm), we can write: 30 cm (depth) * A (base area) = 30 cm (rainfall) To find the base area A, we divide both sides of the equation by the depth (30 cm): A = 30 cm / 30 cm A = 1 square centimeter So, the base area of the puddle is boxed{1} square centimeter.

Since ( triangle ABC ) has a ( 45^circ ) angle at ( A ), it implies that ( triangle AFC ) is a right triangle because the altitude from ( C ) intersects ( AB ) at ( F ), forming two ( 90^circ ) angles due to the property of altitudes in a triangle. 2. Therefore, in ( triangle AFC ), we have: - ( angle AFC = 90^circ ) - ( angle FAC = 45^circ ) - Conclusion: ( angle ACF = 45^circ ) since the sum of angles in a triangle is ( 180^circ ). 3.

Recall that a median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Also, ( M ), the centroid, divides each median into a ratio of ( 2:1 ). 2. **Consider Individual Medians**: We first consider the median ( AM ) from vertex ( A ) to the midpoint of ( BC ). This median divides ( triangle ABC ) into two smaller triangles ( triangle ABM ) and ( triangle ACM ). 3. **Equal Area of Adjacent Medians**: Since ( M ) is the centroid, it acts such that lines joining ( M ) with any side's midpoint will divide the areas of sub-triangles into equal parts: - Medians divide a triangle into smaller triangles of equal area because they have equal bases and the same height from a vertex to the opposite side. 4. **Applying Equal Bases and Heights**: Consider the median ( AM ). Triangles ( triangle ABM ) and ( triangle ACM ) share the same height from ( A ) to ( BC ) and have equal bases ( BM ) and ( CM ). Therefore, [ S_{triangle ABM} = S_{triangle ACM}. ] 5. **Intersection and Area Equivalence**: Similarly, medians ( BM ) and ( CM ) also divide the corresponding adjacent triangles into smaller triangles of equal area: - Using the same reasoning, triangles ( triangle BCM ) and ( triangle CAM ) have the same height from points ( B ) and ( C ) to ( AM ). Therefore, [ S_{triangle BCM} = S_{triangle CAM}. ] 6. **Additional Divisions**: The intersection point ( M ) of all three medians further divides the triangles into six smaller triangles. Because the centroid equally divides each median internally, each small triangle must have equal area. 7. **Verification of Six Equal Areas**: Therefore, the areas of the following six triangles are all equal: [ S_{triangle ABM} = S_{triangle ACM} = S_{triangle BAM} = S_{triangle BCM} = S_{triangle CAM} = S_{triangle AMB}. ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the three medians of a triangle divide it into six smaller triangles of equal area.

Thus, by ensuring that **Class 1** only contains numbers with an even number of '2's and **Class 2** contains numbers with an odd number of '2's, we achieve the requirement. # Conclusion: By this classification, we ensure that summing any two numbers from each class will result in a number that contains at least two digits of '3'. boxed{text{This method successfully ensures the required condition.}}"},{"prompt":"a regular triangular prism (PABC) where all edge lengths are (1), points (L), (M), and (N) are the midpoints of edges (PA), (PB), and (PC) respectively.

If a+3 and 2a+3 are square roots of the same positive number, then squaring both should yield the same result, not summing them to zero. Let's proceed with the correct approach: 1. Square both expressions to find the positive number they are roots of: - (a+3)^2 and (2a+3)^2 should both equal the positive number. 2. Set the two expressions equal to each other because they represent the same number: - (a+3)^2 = (2a+3)^2 3. Expand both sides: - a^2 + 6a + 9 = 4a^2 + 12a + 9 4.

From the equation of the incident ray, we derive the equation of the reflected ray.

Thus, x > -frac{1}{2}. For f'(x) < 0, we solve a(2x + 1)e^{2x} < 0 which simplifies to 2x + 1 < 0 under the same reasoning, leading to x < -frac{1}{2}. Therefore, for a > 0, f(x) is increasing on the interval (-frac{1}{2}, +infty) and decreasing on the interval (-infty, -frac{1}{2}). - **Case 2: a < 0** For f'(x) > 0, we solve a(2x + 1)e^{2x} > 0 which, due to a < 0, leads to 2x + 1 < 0, thus x < -frac{1}{2}. For f'(x) < 0, we solve a(2x + 1)e^{2x} < 0 which, with a < 0, leads to 2x + 1 > 0, thus x > -frac{1}{2}.

With 64 different letters, the number of possible one-letter words is equal to the number of letters, which is 64. For two-letter words, each of the first and second positions can be filled with any of the 64 letters, so the number of possible two-letter words is 64 * 64. Now, if the seventh letter is forbidden, we need to calculate the loss of words that include this letter. For one-letter words, only one word is lost, which is the word consisting of the seventh letter itself. For two-letter words, the seventh letter can appear in the first position, the second position, or both. If it appears in the first position, there are 64 possibilities for the second letter (including the seventh letter itself, since repetition is allowed). If it appears in the second position, there are again 64 possibilities for the first letter. However, we must subtract the case where the seventh letter appears in both positions, as we would be counting it twice. So, the total number of two-letter words lost is: 64 (for the seventh letter in the first position) + 64 (for the seventh letter in the second position) - 1 (for the word where both positions are the seventh letter). Now, let's calculate the total loss: One-letter words lost: 1 Two-letter words lost: 64 + 64 - 1 = 127 Total words lost: 1 (one-letter) + 127 (two-letter) = boxed{128} words."},{"prompt":"Josh has 9 dollars.

Thus, we must have: [ frac{2}{a} = frac{-b}{5} = frac{1}{-c} neq frac{2b}{a} ] 2. **Determine Relationship between Coefficients**: From the proportion: [ frac{2}{a} = frac{-b}{5} = frac{1}{-c} ] The first part (frac{2}{a} = frac{-b}{5}) implies: [ 2 cdot 5 = -b cdot a implies 10 = -ab implies ab = -10 ] The second part (frac{-b}{5} = frac{1}{-c}) implies: [ -b cdot (-c) = 5 implies bc = 5 ] Hence, we obtained two crucial equations: - (ab = -10) - (bc = 5) 3. **Identifying Possible Integer Values**: Since (a, b, c) are integers, (b) must be a divisor of 5. The divisors of 5 are (pm 1) and (pm 5). Let's consider each case: - **Case 1**: (b = 5) - From (ab = -10), we get: [a cdot 5 = -10 implies a = -2] - From (bc = 5), we get: [5 cdot c = 5 implies c = 1] - Hence, one solution is ((-2, 5, 1)). - **Case 2**: (b = -5) - From (ab = -10), we get: [a cdot (-5) = -10 implies a = 2] - From (bc = 5), we get: [-5 cdot c = 5 implies c = -1] - Hence, another solution is ((2, -5, -1)). - **Case 3**: (b = 1) - From (ab = -10), we get: [a cdot 1 = -10 implies a = -10] - From (bc = 5), we get: [1 cdot c = 5 implies c = 5] - Hence, ((-10, 1, 5)) is a possible solution but needs verification against the non-proportional condition. - **Case 4**: (b = -1) - From (ab = -10), we get: [a cdot (-1) = -10 implies a = 10] - From (bc = 5), we get: [-1 cdot c = 5 implies c = -5] - Hence, another solution is ((10, -1, -5)). 4. **Check Proportionality Condition**: For the four pairs ( (a, b, c) = (-2, 5, 1), (2, -5, -1), (-10, 1, 5), (10, -1, -5) ), we need to confirm that the third condition (neq frac{2b}{a}) holds. - For ((a, b, c) = (-2, 5, 1)): [ frac{2b}{a} = frac{2 cdot 5}{-2} = -5 neq frac{2}{-2} = -1 ] - For ((a, b, c) = (2, -5, -1)): [ frac{2b}{a} = frac{2 cdot (-5)}{2} = -5 neq frac{2}{2} = 1 ] - For ((a, b, c) = (-10, 1, 5)): [ frac{2b}{a} = frac{2 cdot 1}{-10} = -frac{1}{5} neq frac{2}{-10} = -frac{1}{5} ] This contradicts the condition. - For ((a, b, c) = (10, -1, -5)): [ frac{2b}{a} = frac{2 cdot (-1)}{10} = -0.2 neq frac{2}{10} = 0.2 ] Conclusion: Therefore, the integer triples that meet the required condition are: [ boxed{(-2, 5, 1), (2, -5, -1), (10, -1, -5)} ]"},{"prompt":"Grandma told Xiaoming: There were 53 Sundays in the year 2006.

( a^a ) is divisible by ( b^b ), 2. ( a ) is not divisible by ( b ), 3. The number ( b ) is coprime with 210. Below gives a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Initial Observation**: - Notice that ( b neq 1 ). - Let ( p ) be a prime factor of ( b ). 2. **Prime Factor of ( b )**: - Since ( b ) is coprime with 210, ( p geq 11 ), because the prime factors of 210 are ( 2, 3, 5, 7 ). 3. **Division Conditions**: - Since ( a^a ) is divisible by ( b^b ), and ( b ) must divide ( a ) (otherwise ( a^a ) couldn’t be divisible by ( b^b )), but ( a ) must not divide ( b ) directly, we infer that ( b ) cannot be a single prime factor. Thus, ( b ) must be a composite number. 4. **Investigating ( b geqslant 3 ) distinct prime factors**: - If ( b ) has at least three distinct prime factors, then ( b ) would be at least ( 11^3 = 1331 ). - Consequently, ( A + B ) (where ( A, B ) are the values of ( a, b ) respectively) would be much larger than needed. Hence, this case can be excluded. 5. **Two Prime Factors Multiplication Condition**: - Suppose ( b ) is a product of two distinct primes, ( q ) and ( r ). - Then ( b = q times r ). However, ( a ) should be divisible by ( q ) and ( r ), meaning ( a ) would also be divisible by ( b ), contradicting the second condition. 6. **Perfect Square Prime**: - Suppose ( b = s^2 ). Now, ( b ) being a square of a prime number ( s ) from primes ( geq 11 ). - Then ( a ) must be divisible by ( s ), say ( a = s cdot k ) where ( k ) is coprime with ( s ) (to satisfy ( a neq b )). Let’s ensure the division condition holds: - Given ( a^a = (s cdot k)^{s cdot k} ). This has to be divisible by ( b^b = (s^2)^{s^2} = s^{2s^2} ). Our ( s^{sk} ) must divide ( s^{2s^2} ), implying ( s cdot k geq 2s^2 ), or equivalently ( k geq 2s ). However, ( k ) needs to be coprime with ( s ), and thus ( k geq 2s + 1). Let’s minimize this: - Consider ( s = 11 ), then ( k geq 23 ), - Hence, ( a geq 11 times 23 = 253 ), - ( b = 11^2 = 121 ), Thus: [ a + b geq 11 cdot 23 + 121 = 374 ] 7. **Verification**: - For ( a = 253 ), and ( b = 121 ): [ a^{a} = 11^{253} times 23^{253} ] This is divisible by: [ b^{b} = 11^{242} ] - ( a = 253 ) is not divisible by ( 121 ), - And, ( 121 ) is coprime with 210.

Using similar triangles: [ frac{O'D}{AD} = frac{OD}{SD} Rightarrow O'D = frac{OD}{SD} cdot AD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}} cdot 3sqrt{3} = frac{3}{2}sqrt{3} ] 8. Point ( P ) divides ( AO' ) such that ( frac{AP}{PO'} = 8 ), thus: [ frac{AP}{AO'} = frac{8}{9} ] 9. We know that the parallel plane through ( P ) intersects ( SD ) at point ( O'' ). Since we maintain the ratio ( frac{AO''}{AO'} = frac{8}{9} ), it follows that: [ O''D = frac{8}{9} cdot O'D = frac{8}{9} cdot frac{3}{2}sqrt{3} = frac{4}{3}sqrt{3} ] 10. Determining ( SO'' ) from ( SO'' = SD - O''D ): [ SO'' = 2sqrt{3} - frac{4}{3}sqrt{3} = frac{6sqrt{3}}{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ] 11. The new section area will be scaled by: [ left(frac{SO''}{SD}right)^2 = left(frac{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}}{2sqrt{3}}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 = frac{1}{9} ] 12. If ( S_{triangle ABC} ) is the area, then: [ text{New Section Area} = frac{1}{9} S_{triangle ABC} ] Since the area of the base triangle is ( 3sqrt{3} ) (a property of triangular bases of a tetrahedron with side ( 6 )), the scaled section is: [ text{Section Area} = frac{1}{9} times 3sqrt{3} = sqrt{3} ] Hence, the final area of the section parallel to the base is: [ boxed{sqrt{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove the following statement: There does not exist a pyramid with square base and congruent lateral faces for which the measures of all edges, total area, and volume are integers.","completion":"To prove that there does not exist a pyramid with a square base and congruent lateral faces for which the measures of all edges, total area, and volume are integers, we will proceed as follows: 1. **Define the Pyramid:** - Let the square base have side length ( a ). - Let the height of the pyramid (perpendicular distance from the apex to the base) be ( h ). - Let the slant height (the height of each triangular face) be ( H ). 2. **Calculate the Area of the Base:** - The area of the square base ( S_{square ABCD} ) is: [ S_{square ABCD} = a^2 ] 3. **Calculate the Volume of the Pyramid:** - The volume ( V ) of the pyramid is given by: [ V = frac{1}{3} times text{Base Area} times text{Height} = frac{1}{3} a^2 h ] - For ( V ) to be an integer, ( frac{1}{3} a^2 h ) must be an integer. This implies that ( a^2 h ) must be divisible by 3. 4. **Calculate the Area of a Triangular Face:** - Each triangular face has a base ( a ) and height ( H ). - The area of one triangular face ( S_{bigtriangleup TAB} ) is: [ S_{bigtriangleup TAB} = frac{1}{2} a H ] - For ( S_{bigtriangleup TAB} ) to be an integer, ( frac{1}{2} a H ) must be an integer. This implies that ( a H ) must be even. 5. **Calculate the Length of the Lateral Edges:** - The length of the lateral edge ( TA ) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height ( h ), half the base ( frac{a}{2} ), and the slant height ( H ): [ TA = sqrt{H^2 + left(frac{a}{2}right)^2} ] - For ( TA ) to be an integer, ( H^2 + left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 ) must be a perfect square. 6. **Check for Integer Conditions:** - Given ( h = 12 ) and ( a = 18 ), we calculate ( H ): [ H = sqrt{h^2 + left(frac{a}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = sqrt{144 + 81} = sqrt{225} = 15 ] - The area of the triangular face: [ S_{bigtriangleup TAB} = frac{1}{2} times 18 times 15 = 135 ] - The volume of the pyramid: [ V = frac{1}{3} times 18^2 times 12 = frac{1}{3} times 324 times 12 = 1296 ] - The length of the lateral edge: [ TA = sqrt{15^2 + 9^2} = sqrt{225 + 81} = sqrt{306} ] Since ( sqrt{306} ) is not an integer, ( TA notin mathbb{N} ). 7. **Conclusion:** - Even though ( h, a, H, S_{bigtriangleup TAB}, ) and ( V ) are integers, the length of the lateral edge ( TA ) is not an integer. Therefore, it is impossible to have a pyramid with a square base and congruent lateral faces where all edge lengths, total area, and volume are integers.

Find the location of the center of mass of this system of points. Also, consider if the mass is proportional to the sine of twice the angle at the vertex, or proportional to the tangent of the angle at the vertex. I. Mass proportional to (sin(alpha)) 1. **Using the Sine Rule:** According to the sine rule: [ frac{sin(B)}{sin(C)} = frac{BC}{AC} ] Therefore, the masses at vertices (A), (B), and (C), denoted as (m_A), (m_B), and (m_C) respectively, are proportional to the lengths of the sides (BC), (CA), and (AB) opposite these vertices. 2. **Interim Center of Mass Calculation:** Consider the interim center of mass (M) of the masses at (B) and (C). The coordinates of (M) satisfy: [ MB : MC = m_C : m_B = AB : AC ] 3. **Angle Bisector:** Using the angle bisector theorem, this point (M) divides (BC) such that (AM) is the angle bisector of (angle BAC). 4. **Location Along the Angle Bisector:** Since (M) lies on the angle bisector, the overall center of mass for the system including the mass at (A) must also lie on the angle bisector (AM). 5. **Extending the Argument:** By similar reasoning for the other vertices and applying the mass specification, conclude that the center of mass must be the intersection of the angle bisectors of the triangle, which is the incenter of the triangle. **Conclusion:** The center of mass when the mass is proportional to (sin(alpha)) is the incenter of the triangle. [ boxed{text{Incenter}} ] II. Mass proportional to (sin(2alpha)) 1. **Mass Computation Using (sin(2alpha)):** Let (N) be the interim center of mass for the masses at (B) and (C). 2. **Using the Angle Properties:** Since (sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)), (BN), (CN) are calculated similarly, ensuring (N) lies inside (BC) due to the positivity of (sin(2x)) for acute angles. Thus, (M) divides internally with (x+y = alpha). 3. **Ratio Simplification:** Simplify using sine addition formulas and tangent properties, giving: [ frac{sin x}{sin y} = frac{cos (beta)}{cos (gamma)} ] 4. **Application of Trigonometric Identities:** Using corollary identities, conclude: [ operatorname{ctg}(y) = frac{cos gamma + cos alpha cos beta}{sin alpha cos beta} ] Simplified to: [ operatorname{tg}(beta) ] 5. **Geometric Insight:** Consequently, similar calculations as part I show (y = 90^circ - beta). This situates (N) as the same as (O)—the circumcenter. **Conclusion:** The center of mass when the mass is proportional to (sin(2alpha)) is the circumcenter of the triangle. [ boxed{text{Circumcenter}} ] III. Mass proportional to (tan(alpha)) 1. **Modifying the Computation Based on Tangent:** Now properties change such that: [ operatorname{ctg}(y) = operatorname{tg}(gamma) ] 2. **Using Supplementary Geometry:** This indicates (y) as a complementary angle (90^circ - gamma). Thus, ensures the interim center (N) lies such that the height divides leading to the orthogonality. 3. **Geometric Insight:** Ultimately, reflecting symmetry, (S) combined with the altitude from (A) will intersect at the orthocenter. **Conclusion:** The center of mass when the mass is proportional to (tan(alpha)) is the orthocenter of the triangle.

Since A alone can complete the work in 36 days, his work rate is ( frac{1}{36} ) of the work per day. When A and B work together, they complete the work in 12 days, so their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{12} ) of the work per day. We can express the combined work rate as the sum of A's and B's individual work rates: [ frac{1}{12} = frac{1}{36} + E_B ] To find B's work rate, we subtract A's work rate from the combined work rate: [ E_B = frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{36} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36: [ E_B = frac{3}{36} - frac{1}{36} ] [ E_B = frac{2}{36} ] Now we simplify the fraction: [ E_B = frac{1}{18} ] So B's work rate is ( frac{1}{18} ) of the work per day. Now we have A's efficiency as ( frac{1}{36} ) and B's efficiency as ( frac{1}{18} ). To find the ratio of A's efficiency to B's efficiency, we divide A's efficiency by B's efficiency: [ text{Ratio of A's efficiency to B's efficiency} = frac{frac{1}{36}}{frac{1}{18}} ] To divide fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction: [ text{Ratio of A's efficiency to B's efficiency} = frac{1}{36} times frac{18}{1} ] [ text{Ratio of A's efficiency to B's efficiency} = frac{18}{36} ] Simplify the fraction: [ text{Ratio of A's efficiency to B's efficiency} = frac{1}{2} ] So the ratio of A's efficiency to B's efficiency is boxed{1:2} ."},{"prompt":"What is the remainder when 2431 cdot 1587 is divided by 800?","completion":"We need to find 2431 equiv x pmod{800} and 1587 equiv y pmod{800}. 1.

First, consider (sqrt{a^2 + b^2}): [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} leq a + b(sqrt{2} - 1) ] This follows from the fact that (sqrt{a^2 + b^2} leq sqrt{a^2 + 2ab + b^2} = a + bsqrt{2}), and since (b geq 0), we can write: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} leq a + b(sqrt{2} - 1) ] 3. Next, consider (sqrt[3]{a^3 + b^3}): [ sqrt[3]{a^3 + b^3} leq a + b(sqrt[3]{2} - 1) ] This follows from the fact that (sqrt[3]{a^3 + b^3} leq sqrt[3]{a^3 + 2ab^2} = a + bsqrt[3]{2}), and since (b geq 0), we can write: [ sqrt[3]{a^3 + b^3} leq a + b(sqrt[3]{2} - 1) ] 4. Finally, consider (sqrt[4]{a^4 + b^4}): [ sqrt[4]{a^4 + b^4} leq a + b(sqrt[4]{2} - 1) ] This follows from the fact that (sqrt[4]{a^4 + b^4} leq sqrt[4]{a^4 + 2ab^3} = a + bsqrt[4]{2}), and since (b geq 0), we can write: [ sqrt[4]{a^4 + b^4} leq a + b(sqrt[4]{2} - 1) ] 5. Summing up all the inequalities: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + sqrt[3]{a^3 + b^3} + sqrt[4]{a^4 + b^4} leq a + b(sqrt{2} - 1) + a + b(sqrt[3]{2} - 1) + a + b(sqrt[4]{2} - 1) ] [ = 3a + b(sqrt{2} - 1 + sqrt[3]{2} - 1 + sqrt[4]{2} - 1) ] [ = 3a + b(sqrt{2} + sqrt[3]{2} + sqrt[4]{2} - 3) ] 6.

The problem asks us to show that the intersection points ( X, Y, Z ) of the external tangents of each pair of circles are collinear. 1. Let's denote the external homothety: - ( H_1 ): from circle ( gamma_1 ) to circle ( gamma_2 ) with center at ( X ), - ( H_2 ): from circle ( gamma_2 ) to circle ( gamma_3 ) with center at ( Y ), - ( H_3 ): from circle ( gamma_3 ) to circle ( gamma_1 ) with center at ( Z ). 2. The ratio of these homotheties is given by: - ( H_1 ) has ratio ( frac{r_2}{r_1} ), - ( H_2 ) has ratio ( frac{r_3}{r_2} ), - ( H_3 ) has ratio ( frac{r_1}{r_3} ). 3. Consider the composition of these homotheties: [ T = H_3 circ H_2 circ H_1 ] 4. Calculate the ratio of this composition: [ text{Ratio of } T = frac{r_2}{r_1} cdot frac{r_3}{r_2} cdot frac{r_1}{r_3} = 1 ] 5. Since the product of the ratios is 1, ( T ) is indeed a translation. ( T ) maps ( gamma_1 ) to itself, specifically mapping the center ( O ) of ( gamma_1 ) to itself, and hence ( T ) is the identity transformation. 6. Therefore, [ H_3 circ H_2 circ H_1 (X) = X ] does not alter ( X ). 7. This implies: [ X = H_3 circ H_2 (X) = H_3(Y) ] 8. Similarly, since ( Y = H_2(X) ), and using the properties of homothety (where the center of homothety lies on the line connecting a point and its image), the center of ( H_2 ) which is ( Y ) lies on the line ( H_2(X)X ). 9. The same argument applies to the center of ( H_3 ), which is ( Z ). Both centers, ( Y ) and ( Z ), lie on the line ( H_2(X)X ). 10. By the properties of homothety, the points ( X, Y, Z ) must be collinear since each homothety's center forms a straight line with the point and its image. Thus, we have shown that the points ( X, Y, ) and ( Z ) are indeed collinear.

The top vertex of the pyramid is denoted as A, and the vertices of the square base are B, C, D, and E. Assume the cube is oriented such that one vertex is at B, and the face opposite to this vertex touches the lateral faces of the pyramid. 3. **Analyze the Geometry**: The diagonal of the square base of the pyramid is sqrt{2} (since the side length of the base is 1, and by the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal is sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}). The diagonal of the base of the cube is ssqrt{2}. 4. **Position of the Cube**: The cube's top face vertices touch the lateral faces of the pyramid.

(It can be shown that other types of lines are not relevant here.) In this situation, the symmetry plane S which contains the line f and is perpendicular to the planes of the circles will be the symmetry plane for the entire arrangement, both before and after folding. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Set-up the Geometry:** Consider the plane S. We are given three segments A B, C D, and E F on the line f without common points. We will explore if we can rotate the end segments such that they become chords of a common circle in the plane S. 2. **Draw Isosceles Triangles:** Construct three isosceles triangles with bases A B, C D, and E F, and with legs each having a length R (where R is greater than the radii of the three circles). Let the apex points of these triangles be X, Y, and Z, respectively. 3. **Find Points of Rotation:** - **Defining Points P and Q:** We are looking for points P and Q on the line f such that rotating A B X around P and E F Z around Q will bring X and Z to coincide with Y, respectively. - **Point P:** P is equidistant from X and Y. Thus, P is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisector of XY and the line f. - **Point Q:** Similarly, Q is equidistant from Y and Z. So, Q is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisector of YZ and the line f. 4. **Rotations and Alignments:** Rotate the triangle A B X around P so that X matches Y, and the triangle E F Z around Q so Z matches Y. The segments A' B', C D, and E' F', where A', B', E', F' are the new positions after rotation, become chords of a common circle with center Y and radius R. 5. **Conclusion:** The three original circles and the two rotated segments (considered as diameters) fit together in a configuration such that there exists a common circle to each arrangement. When considering each segment as the base of its respective triangle and revolving it around its defined point, we achieve the desired result where the three circles align concentrically. Therefore, the three circles on the large paper can always be folded along two lines such that they align on a common sphere. This concludes the proof. The problem requirement is met by ensuring the circles are positioned correctly on a common sphere via appropriate rotations around points P and Q. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Simplify the following expression: (x^5+x^4+x+10)(x^5+2x^4x^3+12).

According to the problem, when N is divided by 44, the remainder is 0. This means that N is a multiple of 44. We can express N as: N = 44Q where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 44. Now, when N is divided by 35, the remainder is 3. We can express this as: N = 35P + 3 where P is the quotient when N is divided by 35. Since N is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions: 44Q = 35P + 3 We need to find a value of N that satisfies both conditions.

It is always non-negative and symmetric about (x = 1). - The function (y = 2^{|x|} - 2) is derived from the exponential function (2^{|x|}).

To find the members who have consumed at least twice, we sum the frequencies of the 2nd visit and beyond: - Total members who have consumed at least twice = 20 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 40 Therefore, the probability that a member will consume at least twice is calculated as: - Probability = frac{text{Number of members who consumed at least twice}}{text{Total number of members}} = frac{40}{100} = 0.4 Hence, the estimated probability that a member will consume at least twice is boxed{0.4}. Part 2: Average Profit from Two Visits For the first visit, the profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the charge: - Profit from 1st visit = 200 - 150 = 50 dollars For the second visit, the charge is discounted by 5%, so the profit is: - Profit from 2nd visit = 200 times 0.95 - 150 = 190 - 150 = 40 dollars The average profit from these two visits is then: - Average profit = frac{50 + 40}{2} = frac{90}{2} = 45 dollars Therefore, the average profit the company makes from a member who only consumes twice is boxed{45 text{ dollars}}.

This means that in triangle ABC, G divides the segment joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side in this ratio. Let M, N, and P be the midpoints of sides BC, AC, and AB, respectively. The vectors overrightarrow{GA}, overrightarrow{GB}, and overrightarrow{GC} can be expressed in terms of the vectors overrightarrow{GM}, overrightarrow{GN}, and overrightarrow{GP}, which are directed from G to the midpoints of the opposite sides. Since G divides the median in 2:1 ratio, for midpoint M we have overrightarrow{GA} = 2overrightarrow{GM} Similarly, for points N and P, we have overrightarrow{GB} = 2overrightarrow{GN}, overrightarrow{GC} = 2overrightarrow{GP}. We can rewrite the given equation using these relationships: a(2overrightarrow{GM}) + b(2overrightarrow{GN}) + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}c(2overrightarrow{GP}) = 0, Factoring out 2 from the entire equation gives us 2left(aoverrightarrow{GM} + boverrightarrow{GN} + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP}right) = 0. Since the vector 0 can only be obtained if the scalar multiples of vectors overrightarrow{GM}, overrightarrow{GN}, and overrightarrow{GP} sum to 0 (as the factor 2 is non-zero), we now have aoverrightarrow{GM} + boverrightarrow{GN} + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP} = 0. As medians divide the opposite side into two equal parts, we have GM = GN = GP = frac{1}{2}. Also, note that the magnitudes a, b, and c correspond to the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Now, consider the vector equation aoverrightarrow{GM} + boverrightarrow{GN}cos C + boverrightarrow{GN}sin C + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP} = 0. The terms boverrightarrow{GN}cos C and frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP} will cancel each other out due to symmetry if C = 60^{circ}, because then cos C = frac{1}{2} and frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{1}{2}. This is only possible when triangle ABC is equilateral. Hence, the angle A in an equilateral triangle is 60^{circ}, but since this option is not given, we have to use the property that the centroid (which is the same point as the center of mass for uniform mass distribution) depends on the triangle's symmetry. If angle A was 90^{circ}, C had to be 45^{circ} to maintain the symmetry of the sides' influence on the centroid, that is not provided either. For any other angle A, the centroid would not divide the median in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, the catch in this problem is to infer that for the given equation to be true, the triangle must be equilateral, and since option B: 60^{circ} isn't available, the next best symmetrical scenario is when angle A = 30^{circ} with triangle ABC being a right-angled triangle at B. This is because if we consider triangle ABC to be a 30-60-90 triangle, where AB = c, the shortest side opposite to the 30-degree angle, then BC = 2a (the side opposite to the 60-degree angle), and AC = sqrt{3}a (the hypotenuse). Under this consideration, sides with lengths b and frac{sqrt{3}}{3}c would actually have the same length (since b = a and frac{sqrt{3}}{3}c = a), fulfilling the necessary symmetry for the vector equation.

We need to determine if, regardless of the rabbit's movements and the tracking device's points, the hunter can always position himself such that after 10^9 moves, the distance between him and the rabbit is at most 100. 2. **Key Definitions**: - Let A_n represent the rabbit's position at the end of the n-th move. - Let B_n represent the hunter's position at the end of the n-th move. - Let P_n be the point provided by the tracking device in the n-th move, which satisfies |P_n - A_n| leq 1. - Let d_i = |A_i - B_i| be the distance between the rabbit and the hunter after the i-th move. 3. **Lemma**: If d_i < 100 during the i-th move, then the hunter cannot ensure that the inequality d_{i+200}^2 leq d_i^2 + frac{1}{2} holds. - **Objective**: Prove this lemma. 4. **Lemma Proof**: - The rabbit aims to increase the distance squared by more than frac{1}{2} within 200 moves. - Assume at the i-th move, the rabbit reveals its position A_i. - Let ell be the line through A_i and B_i.

To correct this: to move from y = sin(2x - frac{3pi}{4}) to y = sin 2x, we actually need to shift the graph to the left, not to the right, because we are effectively \\"undoing\\" the phase shift introduced by -frac{3pi}{4}. 4. Therefore, to transform the graph of y = sin(2x - frac{3pi}{4}) into the graph of y = sin 2x, we shift it to the left by frac{3pi}{8} units.

We can do this by dividing 79 by 11 and taking the integer part of the result, then multiplying it back by 11. 79 ÷ 11 = 7 with a remainder (since 11 * 7 = 77) So the largest number less than or equal to 79 that is divisible by 11 is 77.

Therefore, any numbers differing by 3 must either be both good or both bad. This further means any residue class modulo 3 must be completely good or completely bad. First, break down the first 2000 numbers into their residue classes modulo 3: [ {1, 2, ldots, 2000} ] The residue classes will be: [ {0, 1, 2 } mod 3 ] Each class contains either 666 or 667 elements, since: [ leftlfloor frac{2000}{3} rightrfloor = 666 quad (text{with one additional number, in this case, resulting in 667 for one residue}) ] 6. **Final implication:** Each class is either entirely good or entirely bad.

We need to prove that if the intersection T does not contain any integer point, then T must be a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral. 1. **Understanding the polygons ( P ) and ( Q )**: Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are both closed convex polygons, their intersection ( T = P cap Q ) must also be a (possibly degenerate) closed convex polygon. 2. **Identifying cases for ( T )**: We consider what ( T ) could be. - **Case 1**: ( T ) is a single point. If ( T ) is just a point, it would have to be a vertex of ( P ) or ( Q ). Since vertices of ( P ) and ( Q ) are integer points, this contradicts the condition that ( T ) does not contain integer points. - **Case 2**: ( T ) is a line segment. If ( T ) is a line segment, that line segment would be an intersection of an edge of ( P ) and an edge of ( Q ).

Each edge of ( T ) lies partially along an edge of either ( P ) or ( Q ). 4. **Colouring argument**: - Colour the edges of ( P ) red and the edges of ( Q ) blue. - The boundary of ( T ) must alternate between red and blue edges. - If there are two consecutive edges of the same colour, their common vertex must be a vertex of ( P ) or ( Q ) (or both), contradicting that ( T ) does not contain any integer points. 5. **Conclusion on the number of edges**: Hence, ( T )’s boundary must alternate between the red and blue edges, leading to an even number of edges. To ensure ( T ) does not contain any integer points inside or on the boundary, it has to be at least a quadrilateral. 6. **Elimination for smaller possibilities**: Let’s analyze: - Suppose ( T ) contains six or more edges.

The sphere through A, B, C, and P is tangent to the sphere through A', B', C', and P. Prove that AA'=BB'=CC'.","completion":"Step-by-step Proof: 1. **Understanding the Geometry**: - We are given that chords AA', BB', and CC' of a sphere meet at an interior point P and are not contained in the same plane. - Two spheres are described: one through points A, B, C, and P, and another through points A', B', C', and P. These spheres are tangent to each other. 2. **Using the Tangency of Spheres**: - The tangency of the two spheres implies that there exists a common tangent plane at point P. 3. **Circle Intersections and Plane Geometry**: - Since any cross-section of a sphere through its center is a circle, the points A, A', B, B' lie on a circle omega_1 in one sphere, and A, B, P lie on a circle omega_2, and A', B', P lie on a circle omega_3 in the other sphere. 4. **Angle and Power of a Point**: - Since mangle APB = mangle A'PB' (as they are vertical angles), and by the Power of a Point theorem, we have (AP)(A'P) = (BP)(B'P). This leads to frac{AP}{B'P} = frac{BP}{A'P}. 5. **Using Triangle Similarity**: - By the SAS similarity criterion, triangle APB sim triangle B'PA', which implies angle ABP cong angle B'PA'. 6. **Common Tangent Plane and Tangent-Chord Theorem**: - The common tangent plane at P intersects the plane containing A, A', B, B', P along a line l. This line l is the common tangent of circles omega_2 and omega_3. - By the Tangent-Chord Theorem, the central angles subtended by chords AP and A'P, and BP and B'P are equal. 7. **Chord Lengths in Circles**: - The length of a chord for a given central angle theta in a circle of radius r is 2rsin(theta). Since the central angles are equal, the ratios frac{AP}{A'P} = frac{BP}{B'P} hold. 8. **Concluding Isosceles Triangles**: - Since triangle APB sim triangle A'PB', and angle ABP cong angle A'PB' cong angle B'PA', both triangle APB and triangle A'PB' are isosceles. - This implies AP = BP and A'P = B'P, and hence AA' = BB'. 9. **Symmetry and Final Conclusion**: - By symmetry (the problem and arguments are symmetric with respect to the points and their primed counterparts), the same reasoning applies to BB' and CC', and CC' and AA'. - Therefore, we conclude that AA' = BB' = CC'. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"There are five boxes, each containing an equal number of apples.

Substituting this equation into the parabola's equation, we get k y^2 - 4y + 4m = 0. Since the discriminant must be positive for two distinct points A and B to exist on C, we have mk < 1. Using Viete's formulas we also have y_1 + y_2 = frac{4}{k}, y_1 y_2 = frac{4m}{k}. Given y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + x_2) + 2m = 4k + 2m, combined with the above we get m = frac{2}{k} - 2k.

Let’s consider the given larger circle. Let points B and C be points on the larger circle such that angle BAC = alpha. 2. First method: Denote the points C' and B' as the other points of intersection of the lines AC and AB with the larger circle, respectively (see left diagram). - Since angle BAC = alpha, by the properties of the inscribed angles, the sum of arcs BC and B'C' on the larger circle is 2alpha. Thus, these arcs are equal in measure, and we have two equal arcs on the circle. - Consequently, quadrilateral BB'C'C can either be an isosceles trapezoid or a rectangle. - The axis of symmetry of this trapezoid passes through the midpoints of its bases and the common center O of the circles. Therefore, the entire configuration is symmetric with respect to this axis. Consequently, the angles angle BAC and angle B'A'C' cut equal arcs on the smaller circle. The sum of these arcs equals 2alpha, so each one equals alpha. 3. Second method: Since alpha < 180^{circ}, the points O and A lie on the same side of the chord BC. - As such, angles angle BOC and angle BAC are oriented the same way, aligning consistently with said orientation. - Rotating around the common center O, which maps B to C, the segment BA translates to segment CX, where X is a point on the ray CA inside the smaller circle. - Following the same rotation, point D maps to point E (which are intersections of segments BA and CA with the smaller circle, respectively) (see right diagram).

She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, so she used (1/2)B kilograms for that. She used one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, so she used (1/5)B kilograms for that. After using butter for chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies, she has: B - (1/2)B - (1/5)B left. To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 10 in this case: B - (5/10)B - (2/10)B = (10/10)B - (5/10)B - (2/10)B = (3/10)B So, she has (3/10)B kilograms of butter left after making the first two kinds of cookies.

For a = log_{8} 5: [ a = log_{8} 5 = frac{log_{2} 5}{log_{2} 8} = frac{log_{2} 5}{log_{2} (2^3)} = frac{log_{2} 5}{3} ] 6.

To prove: We need to show that the tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects line ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 1. **Identify Key Points and Circles:** Let's introduce the points and circles more formally: - ( w_1 ): A circle with some center ( O ). - ( w_2 ): The second circle with center ( U ). - ( Y ): The intersection of circle ( w_1 ) with the median ( BM ). - ( K ) and ( L ): Points on line ( AC ). 2. **Positioning the Center ( U ):** Observing the circles, the center ( U ) of the second circle ( w_2 ) lies at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 3. **Symmetry of the Problem:** Given that point ( Y ) lies on the second circle ( w_2 ), we need to show that segment ( UK ) is tangent to the first circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ), making circles ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) orthogonal. 4. **Orthogonality Conditions for Circles:** Two circles are orthogonal if the radius of one at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the radius of the other. Specifically, - ( w_1 perp w_2 ) implies that the radius from the center ( O ) of ( w_1 ) to the tangency point ( Y ) is perpendicular to the radius from ( U ) (center of ( w_2 )) to ( Y ). 5. **Inversion Property:** To show orthogonality through inversion, we utilize the following property: - A circle remains invariant (unchanged) in position under an inversion with respect to another circle if the two circles are orthogonal. 6. **Geometric Analysis of Points L and L’:** Consider point ( L ) on ( AC ) and its inverse point ( L' ) with respect to circle ( w_1 ). The angles are preserved under inversion, thus [ angle AL'L = angle OAL ] Similarly, [ angle OCL = angle OL'C ] Therefore, ( L'L ) bisects ( A L'C ), making: [ frac{AL'}{L'C} = frac{AL}{LC} ] This implies ( L' ) lies on the Apollonian circle defined by points ( A, C ) and the segment ( KL ). # Conclusion: By proving the segment ( UK ) is tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at ( Y ) and that ( L' ) lies on an Apollonian circle, we have shown the desired symmetry and tangency properties. Hence, the orthogonality condition ( w_1 perp w_2 ) is satisfied.

It is prohibited to repaint an edge with a different color or paint an edge twice with the same color. The winner is the one who first manages to paint all the edges of any face with their color. Is it true that the first player necessarily wins if they play optimally?","completion":"Let's analyze the problem in a detailed step-by-step manner. 1. **Understanding the Cube and Edges**: - A cube has 12 edges, and there are two players who take turns to color these edges either red or green. - The first player starts by coloring 3 edges red. - The second player then colors 3 of the remaining edges green. - This process continues until all edges are colored. 2. **Game Objective**: - The aim is for either player to be the first to color all 4 edges of any one face of the cube with their respective color. 3. **Player Strategy**: - Since both players can choose any 3 uncolored edges each turn, they need to strategically plan their moves. - It's crucial to understand the structure of the cube and the distribution of edges among its faces to develop a winning strategy. 4. **Analysis of Partner's Move**: - The key insight is that the partner can always prevent the first player from winning by choosing to color any three sets of intersecting edges in each turn. - Here's why: The first player cannot force the completion of a single face if the second player always targets three intersecting edges. 5. **Detailed Step-by-step Calculation**: Suppose vertices of the cube are labeled as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, ) and ( H ) where ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) form the top face and ( E, F, G, ) and ( H ) form the bottom face. - Edges are ( AB, BC, CD, DA ) (top face), ( EF, FG, GH, HE ) (bottom face), and ( AE, BF, CG, DH ) (vertical edges). - Any face of the cube is determined by two pairs of intersecting edges. Let’s denote the move cycle where: - Player 1 colors edges (e_1, e_2, e_3) red. - Player 2 then colors (e_4, e_5, e_6) green. 6. **Partner Winning Strategy**: - Immediately after Player 1's move, Player 2 colors 3 edges in such a way as to disrupt the possibility of Player 1 forming a single-colored face. - During Player 2's turn, any set of three intersecting edges (e_4, e_5, e_6) can be chosen such that no face of the cube will have three red edges in subsequent moves by Player 1. 7. **Example Scenario**: - Suppose Player 1 colors edges (AB, BC, CA) (one set of intersecting edges on the top face). - Player 2 can then color (AE, BF, CG) (each intersecting the edges (AB, BC, CA) respectively and preventing a single-color face formation). - Thus, Player 1, in their next move, cannot complete a face without being intersected by green-colored edges. **Conclusion**: - This strategy ensures that the second player can always protect at least one edge per face from being fully colored by Player 1, disrupting any complete colored face.

To find the maximum, we observe that the expression 2x + frac{24200}{x} is minimized when 2x = frac{24200}{x}, leading to x = 110. Substituting x = 110 into the profit equation gives y_{max} = 3660.

If students solved exactly four problems, no pair of problems can be solved by a student who solved the other two problems together. 4. **Counting Combination**: - Every student can solve at most three problems without colliding with pair solutions due to constraints of at most 1000 consistent solvers for each problem. - To satisfy this condition, for k problems, each has exactly 1000 solvers, the combination coverage across students will be minimized by solving at most three problems. 5. **Minimum Analysis**: - Let's calculate the minimum number of students if each student solved no more than three problems: - There are 6 problems, and each problem has 1000 distinct solvers: [ text{Total number of solving requirements} = 6 times 1000 = 6000 ] - Each student can solve at most 3 problems: [ text{Minimum students required} = frac{6000}{3} = 2000 ] 6. **Verification**: - Consider an example: - (500) students solve problems ((1,2,3)) - (500) students solve problems ((3,4,5)) - (500) students solve problems ((1,5,6)) - (500) students solve problems ((2,4,6)) - Each problem is precisely solved by (1000) students without any overlapping of 6 problems by any two students, thus meeting constraints strictly. # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest number of high school students who participated in the spring tour is [ boxed{2000} ]"},{"prompt":"w many weeks are equivalent to 2016 hours?","completion":"1.

This ensures that the sum is appropriate for partitioning. However, analyzing the parity, we get: - If m is odd, then ( 3m ) is odd and ( frac{3m cdot (3m + 1)}{2} ) is even (since an odd number times the next even number is always even). - If m is even, then ( 3m ) is even and thus a multiple of 4 is needed to maintain the sum even. 5.

So, the relative speed can also be calculated by dividing the length of the train by the time taken to cross the man: Vr = Length of train / Time taken to cross Vr = 700 m / 41.9966402687785 s Now we can calculate Vr: Vr ≈ 700 / 41.9966402687785 Vr ≈ 16.668 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) Now we can find the speed of the train (Vt) by adding the speed of the man to the relative speed: Vt = Vr + (5/6) Vt ≈ 16.668 + (5/6) Vt ≈ 16.668 + 0.833 Vt ≈ 17.501 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) To convert the speed of the train back to km/hr: Vt in km/hr = Vt in m/s * (3600 s / 1 hr) * (1 km / 1000 m) Vt in km/hr ≈ 17.501 * (3600 / 1000) Vt in km/hr ≈ 17.501 * 3.6 Vt in km/hr ≈ 63.0036 km/hr So, the speed of the train is approximately boxed{63.0036} km/hr."},{"prompt":"What is the value of the expression frac{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8 cdot 9 cdot 10}{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10}? textbf{(A) }65065qquadtextbf{(B) }66069qquadtextbf{(C) }67074qquadtextbf{(D) }68080qquadtextbf{(E) }69085","completion":"1. **Calculate the numerator**: The numerator of the given expression is the product of the first 10 positive integers: [ 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8 cdot 9 cdot 10 = 10! ] Using the factorial of 10, we find: [ 10! = 3628800 ] 2. **Calculate the denominator**: The denominator is the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

Again, the statement holds. 3. **Inductive assumption**: Assume the statement holds for sets of n-1 elements, i.e., if S_0 is a subset of S containing n-1 elements, then the corresponding set T_0 of sums of k elements in S_0 contains at least k(n-k-1) + 1 distinct sums. 4. **Inductive step**: - Define S_0 = {s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{n-1}} such that S is the set of elements s_1 < s_2 < cdots < s_n. - By inductive assumption, left| T_0 right| geq k(n-k-1) + 1. 5. **Define new sums**: - Define x = s_n + s_{n-1} + cdots + s_{n-k}. - For i = 0, 1, ldots, k, let y_i = x - s_{n-i}. This generates k+1 distinct sums because s_i are distinct and ordered. 6. **Properties of new sums**: - Notice y_0, y_1, ldots, y_k are all in T since they are sums of k distinct elements from S. Moreover, y_0 < y_1 < y_2 < cdots < y_k. - The sum y_0 is actually the largest sum in T_0, thus y_i (i=1,2,cdots,k) must be new elements, i.e., y_i in T but y_i notin T_0 for i = 1, 2,..., k. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since we have found k new distinct elements in T that are not in T_0, we have: [ |T| geq left| T_0 right| + k geq k(n-k-1) + 1 + k = k(n-k) + 1. ] 8. **Final Conclusion**: Hence, we have shown by induction that the set T contains at least k(n-k) + 1 distinct elements. Thus, T contains at least k(n-k) + 1 distinct elements. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"wo years older than b who is twice as old as c.

Let the radii of the two smaller circles be denoted as ( r ) and the radius of the larger circle be denoted as ( R ), where ( r < R ). 2. Each pair of touching circles will have their centers along a line passing through their point of tangency.

Next, the distance between the center of one of the smaller circles and the center of the larger circle, due to tangency, will be ( R - r ). 4. Therefore, the triangle formed by connecting the centers of the three circles will have one side equal to ( 2r ) and the other two sides equal to ( R - r ). 5.

Assume the line (e) is chosen as the x-axis and is represented by the equation (y=0). Hence, coordinates of any point (X) on (e) can be written as ((x, 0)). 2. Let the coordinates of the triangle's vertices be (A(x_1, y_1)), (B(x_2, y_2)), and (C(x_3, y_3)). 3.

Thus, it's clear that the third inequality is valid for any lambda > 0. Therefore, we focus on the first and second inequalities to determine the range of lambda. From inequality (1), we have: lambda < 1 + frac{y}{x} + sqrt{1 + left(frac{y}{x}right)^2}. Let t = frac{y}{x} where t > 1. We can then define a function f(t) = 1 + t + sqrt{1 + t^2}. Taking the derivative of f with respect to t, we get: f'(t) = 1 + frac{t}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} > 0, which implies that f(t) is increasing on the interval (1, +infty). Thus, for t > 1: f(t) > f(1) = 2 + sqrt{2}, leading to: lambda leq 2 + sqrt{2}. From inequality (2), we obtain: lambda > 1 + frac{y}{x} - sqrt{1 + left(frac{y}{x}right)^2}. Defining another function g(t) = 1 + t - sqrt{1 + t^2} and differentiating it with respect to t, we find: g'(t) = frac{sqrt{1 + t^2} - t}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} > 0, which shows that g(t) is increasing for t > 1. Rewriting g(t) as: g(t) = frac{2t}{1 + t + sqrt{1 + t^2}} = frac{2}{1 + frac{1}{t} + sqrt{1 + frac{1}{t^2}}}, we see that as t approaches infinity, g(t) approaches 1. Therefore, we have: g(t) < 1. This gives us: lambda geq 1. Combining the results obtained from inequalities (1) and (2), we find the range for lambda: 1 leq lambda leq 2 + sqrt{2}.

How many positive integers less than 1992 are not factorial tails?","completion":"To determine how many positive integers less than 1992 are not \\"factorial tails,\\" we proceed through the following steps: 1. **Understand the Definition**: A number ( n ) is said to be a \\"factorial tail\\" if there exists an integer ( m ) such that the decimal representation of ( m! ) (the factorial of ( m )) ends with exactly ( n ) zeros. 2. **Counting Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in ( m! ) is determined by the number of factors of 10 in ( m! ). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and factorials have more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is given by the number of factors of 5 in ( m! ). This can be calculated as: [ f(m) = leftlfloor frac{m}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{5^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{5^3} rightrfloor + cdots ] where ( leftlfloor x rightrfloor ) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ). 3. **Function Analysis**: We define ( f(m) ) as the number of trailing zeros of ( m! ): - ( f(m) ) is a non-decreasing function. - For multiples of 5, ( f(m) ) increases by 1. Specifically, for ( m ) such that ( m = 5k ) for some integer ( k ), we have: [ f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4) ] and [ f(m+5) > f(m) ] 4. **Pattern Recognition**: We recognize a repeating pattern in ( f(m) ).

Hence, statement A is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the distance is equal to the vertices instead of the sides. - **Statement B**: In an isosceles triangle, the axis of symmetry indeed passes through the median on its base. This median is also an altitude and an angle bisector. The statement in the solution seems to imply that this fact is incorrect, but in reality, it is a correct description of the properties of an isosceles triangle.

The axis of symmetry does align with the median on the base, making the explanation provided misleading. - **Statement C**: For congruent triangles, all corresponding sides and angles are equal by definition. This is a fundamental property of congruent triangles, making statement C unequivocally correct. - **Statement D**: If two lines are parallel, the corresponding interior angles formed by a transversal are equal, not supplementary. Supplementary angles sum up to 180 degrees, which is not the case here. The correct property related to parallel lines and angles is the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem or the Corresponding Angles Postulate, which states that the angles are equal.

Thus, b - c = uv(1 - a). 4. **Divisibility Condition:** To establish divisibility, note [ 1 - a mid uv(1 - a) = b - c. ] 5. **Computing Expressions:** [ begin{aligned} p(1) &= (1)^{3} + a (1)^{2} + b (1) + c = 1 + a + b + c, p(-1) &= (-1)^{3} + a (-1)^{2} + b (-1) + c = -1 + a - b + c, end{aligned} ] [ p(0) &= c. ] 6. **Evaluating the Required Expression:** [ begin{aligned} p(1) + p(-1) - 2[1 + p(0)] &= (1 + a + b + c) + (-1 + a - b + c) - 2[1 + c] &= (1 + a + b + c - 1 + a - b + c - 2 - 2c) &= 2 (a - 1). end{aligned} ] 7. **Formulating 2p(-1) and Checking Divisibility:** [ 2p(-1) = 2(-1 + a - b + c) = -2 + 2a - 2b + 2c. ] 8. **Conclusion of Divisibility:** We need to show that 2 (a - 1) divides -2 + 2a - 2b + 2c which simplifies to: [ begin{aligned} -2 + 2a - 2b + 2c &= 2(a - 1 - b + c). end{aligned} ] Thus, 2p(-1) = 2(a - 1 - b + c) is divisible by 2(a - 1). 9. **Special Case a = 1:** When a = 1, we have u + v + uv = -1, leading to b = c. This implies that one root must be -1. Therefore, 2p(-1) = 0 which is divisible by any integer, fulfilling the condition.

The two concrete crossroads divide the box into three equal parts along the length. Since the roads run in the middle of the box, they divide the length into three equal parts. Therefore, each part has a length of L/3. The width of each road is 3 meters, so the total width taken up by the two roads is 2 * 3 = 6 meters. The area of the lawn is the total area of the box minus the area taken up by the roads. The total area of the box is L * 40 square meters.

(b) (sum_{k=0}^{n} (k-1)^{2} p_{n}(k) = n!) First, recall that the total number of permutations of a set ( S ) with ( n ) elements is ( n! ). Also note: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} p_{n}(k) = n! ] We approach the proofs as follows: Part (a) To each permutation ( pi ) of ( S ), associate an ( n )-vector ((e_1, e_2, ldots, e_n)), where ( e_i ) is 1 if ( i ) is a fixed point of ( pi ), and 0 otherwise. Thus, the sum ( sum_{k=0}^{n} k p_{n}(k) ) represents the total number of 1's in all the ( n! ) vectors. Note that each element ( i in S ) is a fixed point in exactly ((n-1)!) permutations. Hence, each ( e_i = 1 ) appears ((n-1)!) times for each ( i ) from 1 to ( n ). Thus, the total number of 1's across all vectors is calculated by: [ text{Total number of 1's} = n cdot (n-1)! = n! ] This implies: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} k p_{n}(k) = n! ] Part (b) Assign each permutation ( pi ) of ( S ) a vector ((d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n)), where ( d_i = k ) if ( i ) is a fixed point of ( pi ) and ( k ) is the number of fixed points of ( pi ).

Since there are ( p_{n}(k) ) vectors with exactly ( k ) components equal to ( k ), each contributing ( k^2 ) to the sum, we have: [ Z = sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 p_{n}(k) ] For each fixed point ( i ) across all permutations, ( d_i = k ) (where ( k > 0 )) occurs exactly ( p_{n-1}(k-1) ) times. Therefore: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k p_{n-1}(k-1) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + 1) p_{n-1}(k) = 2(n-1)! ] Summing over all ( i ) in ( S ) gives: [ Z = sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 p_{n}(k) = 2n! ] Using the noted sums, we calculate: [ sum_{k=0}^{n}(k-1)^2 p_{n}(k) = sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 p_{n}(k) - 2sum_{k=0}^{n} k p_{n}(k) + sum_{k=0}^{n} p_{n}(k) ] Plugging in the results: [ sum_{k=0}^{n}(k-1)^2 p_{n}(k) = 2n! - 2n! + n! = n! ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{n!} ]"},{"prompt":"Lucille made an agreement with her mom that she would earn a certain amount for every weed she pulled in her mom's garden.

This implies that the projection of ( S ) onto the plane ( ABC ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ). - In this case, due to the given nature of the isosceles right triangle ( ABC ), the projection is the midpoint of ( AB ).

Given two disjoint circles (meaning they do not overlap or intersect), we can consider the segment connecting the centers of these two circles. This segment is used as a diameter to draw a new circle. This new circle will intersect the two external common tangents of the original circles at four points. We need to prove that these four intersection points form a quadrilateral whose diagonals are the internal tangents common to the original circles. 2. **Definition of Points and Symmetry**: Let the centers of the two given circles be denoted as (O_1) and (O_2). Let (P) be one of the intersection points formed on the new circle by the tangents of the original circles. Due to symmetry, it's sufficient to prove the property for this specific point (P), and the same reasoning applies to the other three points. 3. **Symmetry in Tangency**: In circle geometry, from any exterior point (like (P)), two tangents can be drawn to the circle. These tangents are symmetric with respect to the line segment connecting the point to the circle's center. Hence, (O_1P) and (O_2P) will bisect the angles formed by the tangents at (P). 4. **Angle Analysis**: Since (O_1P) and (O_2P) are bisectors of the angles formed by the tangents, we denote the angles between the tangents at (P) as (2alpha) and (2beta), then: [ 2alpha + 2beta = 180^circ. ] Simplifying the above, we get: [ alpha + beta = 90^circ. ] 5. **Right Angle at ( angle O_1 PO_2 ) and Thales' Theorem**: The angle (angle O_1 PO_2) is a right angle (i.e., (90^circ)). By Thales' theorem, a triangle inscribed in a circle whose vertex subtends a semicircle (or diameter) is a right triangle. This implies that (P) lies on the circle with diameter (O_1O_2). 6. **Conclusion**: Since the argument proves that point (P) lies on the circle whose diameter is (O_1O_2), and due to symmetrical properties, this applies to the other intersection points as well. Therefore, all four points defined by the intersections of the tangents lie on the circle with (O_1O_2) as the diameter, making the diagonals of the quadrilateral these points form the internal tangents of the original circles.

According to Step 6, the segments DC, DE, and AB are equal. 2. **Symmetry Axis:** The line DS acts as an axis of symmetry for the pentagon because it bisects the segment PQ, making it perpendicular to AB at its midpoint. 3. **Angle Calculation:** To verify the regularity, it is sufficient to show angle ASB = 72^circ, as this implies angle CSD and angle DSE are also 72^circ. Consequently, [ angle ASE = angle BSC = frac{180^circ - 3 cdot 72^circ}{2} = 72^circ. ] Let K be the midpoint of PQ. From the isosceles triangles triangle PQS and triangle PQD, considering that QR = 2r, we get: [ KS = frac{r sqrt{3}}{2}, quad KD = frac{r sqrt{15}}{2} = KS sqrt{5} ] Therefore, the radius of k_5 is SA = SD = KD - KS = KS (sqrt{5} - 1). Using the isosceles triangle triangle ABS, we find: [ cos(angle ASK) = frac{KS}{AS} = frac{1}{sqrt{5} - 1} = frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4} ] According to the problem reference ( text{K.M.L. 25 (1962/11) 118 } ), this implies angle ASK = 36^circ. Hence, angle ASB = 72^circ, confirming that the angles of our pentagon are correct. # II. Verification of Intersection Lines: To confirm that the lines EA and FA will intersect at C and E, we must consider the constructed regular pentagon with internal angle 108^circ at EAB and the external angle 72^circ at BFA. From triangle angle sum properties and the inscribed angle theorem: [ angle BAF = angle BAD = frac{180^circ - angle ADB}{2} = 90^circ - frac{angle ASB}{4} = 72^circ. ] Therefore, this confirms that the construction aligns with a regular pentagon, ensuring: [ boxed{C text{ and } E text{ can be intersected by lines } FB text{ and } FA.} ]"},{"prompt":"The reciprocal of frac{2}{3} is A: frac{3}{2} B: frac{3}{2} C: frac{2}{3} D: frac{2}{3}","completion":"To find the reciprocal of a fraction, you simply flip the numerator and denominator and keep the sign.

Subtracting P(X) from both sides gives: [ P(X+1) - P(X) = P(X) - P(X-1) ] This difference indicates that the increments are constant, denoted by a. 2. This property implies that P(n+1) - P(n) = a for all integers n in mathbb{N}. 3. Since P(n+1) - P(n) = a, we can integrate this linear form: [ P(n) = P(0) + na text{ for some constant } P(0) = b ] 4.
