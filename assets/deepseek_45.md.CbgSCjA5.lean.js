A mechanical fan circulates the hot air around the food at high speed, cooking the food and producing a crispy layer via the Maillard effect. Essentially, it mimics the results of deep-frying but with little to no oil, making it a healthier alternative for those looking to reduce their fat intake. # Key Features: - **Rapid Air Technology**: Air fryers work by rapidly circulating hot air around the food, ensuring that the food is cooked evenly and quickly. - **Versatility**: Although primarily used for frying, air fryers are quite versatile. They can also bake, roast, and grill a variety of foods, from french fries and chicken wings to vegetables and frozen foods. - **Healthier Cooking**: Since air fryers require significantly less oil than traditional deep frying, they offer a much healthier cooking method. Food retains less oil, resulting in lower fat and calorie intake. - **Ease of Use and Cleaning**: Most air fryers are equipped with easy-to-use digital interfaces. Additionally, many air fryers come with dishwasher-safe parts, making them easy to clean. - **Safety**: Compared to traditional deep fryers, air fryers are generally safer to use, as they significantly reduce the risk of oil splatters and burns. They also have auto shut-off mechanisms to prevent overcooking. # How It Works: 1. **Loading the Food**: Food is placed in a basket-like compartment, which allows the hot air to circulate freely around the food. 2. **Setting Temperature and Time**: Users select the cooking temperature and time. Typical cooking temperatures range from 175 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 80 to 200 degrees Celsius). 3. **Cooking Process**: The device's heating element heats the air inside the machine, while a fan circulates this hot air around the food. This process cooks the food quickly and evenly, producing a crispy outer layer. 4. **End of Cooking**: Most air fryers will notify the user either with a beep or by automatically turning off when the cooking cycle is complete. # Advantages of Using an Air Fryer: - **Healthier Meals**: By using less oil, air fryers can cook healthier versions of traditionally unhealthy fried foods. - **Quicker Cooking Times**: Air fryers generally cook food faster than traditional ovens, with preheating times that are significantly shorter. - **Crispier Results**: For foods like french fries, chicken wings, and vegetables, an air fryer can achieve a crispy texture that's hard to get with baking. - **Cleaner and Safer**: Without the need to work with large quantities of hot oil, cooking with an air fryer is cleaner and reduces the risk of accidents. # Considerations: While air fryers offer a healthier alternative to traditional frying and provide convenience, they may not always replicate the exact taste and texture of deep-fried foods. Additionally, due to their size, air fryers might not be suitable for cooking large meals in one go, making them less ideal for larger families or gatherings without cooking in batches. In summary, air fryers are a convenient, versatile, and healthier cooking appliance suitable for preparing a wide range of foods, from snacks to main dishes."},{"prompt":"How to cook French fries in an air fryer?","completion":"Cooking French fries in an air fryer is a simple and healthier alternative to deep-frying. Air fryer French fries offer a crispy texture without the excessive oil. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started: # Ingredients - 2 large potatoes - 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil (or any vegetable oil of your choice) - Salt, to taste - Optional: pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or any other seasoning you like # Instructions 1. **Prep the Potatoes**: Start by peeling the potatoes (if you prefer them peeled; otherwise, just wash them thoroughly). Cut them into thin slices for a classic French fry shape. Try to keep the slices uniform for even cooking. 2. **Soak the Potatoes**: Soak the potato slices in cold water for at least 30 minutes, or even overnight if you have time. This step helps remove excess starch, contributing to a crispier end product. 3. **Dry the Potatoes**: After soaking, thoroughly drain and dry the potato slices with a clean towel. It’s crucial they’re dry to ensure they crisp up in the air fryer. 4. **Season**: Place the dried potato slices in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and your choice of seasoning. Toss until the fries are evenly coated. 5. **Preheat the Air Fryer** (optional, depending on your model): Preheat your air fryer to 380°F (about 193°C) for a few minutes. Not all models require preheating, so consult your air fryer’s manual. 6. **Cook**: Place the seasoned potato slices in the air fryer basket. Try not to overcrowd them; cook in batches if necessary for better circulation of air and even cooking. 7. **Fry**: Cook the fries at 380°F (193°C) for 10-15 minutes. Shake the basket or toss the fries halfway through the cooking time to ensure they cook evenly. 8. **Crisp Them Up**: For extra crispiness, increase the temperature to 400°F (about 204°C) and cook for an additional 5 minutes or until they’ve reached your desired level of crispiness. 9. **Final Seasoning**: Once cooked, you can toss the fries in a bit more salt or seasoning if needed. 10. **Serve**: Serve the fries immediately while they’re hot and crispy for the best taste and texture. # Tips for Perfect Air Fryer French Fries: - **Soaking**: Don’t skip the soaking step, as it really helps in removing the starch and achieving crispier fries. - **Oil**: While you need much less oil than deep frying, make sure the fries are well-coated to help them crisp up. - **Batch Cooking**: Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket. Cooking in batches allows hot air to circulate more effectively. - **Shaking/Tossing**: Shaking the basket a few times during cooking promotes even browning and crisping. With these simple steps, you can enjoy delicious, homemade French fries that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, without the guilt of traditional deep frying!"},{"prompt":"give me some ideas for the name of an astromancy radio station","completion":"Creating a name for an astromancy-themed radio station calls for a blend of cosmic allure and radio vibes.

Un exemple courant est l'utilisation de méthodes comme \`firstWhere\` sans qu'aucun élément ne satisfasse le critère, conduisant à cette exception. En revanche, dans le code que vous avez partagé, je ne vois pas immédiatement un appel explicite à une telle méthode pouvant causer cette erreur spécifique. Cependant, voici quelques pistes possibles pour investiguer et résoudre cette erreur dans le cadre de votre application de jeu Snake : 1. **Validation des Coordonnées du Serpent** : Assurez-vous que toutes les opérations de manipulation de la grille et des positions du serpent, y compris sa croissance, valident correctement les coordonnées. Cela inclut de vérifier que \`x\` et \`y\` restent dans les limites de la grille lors du mouvement ou de l'agrandissement du serpent. 2. **Génération et Placement de Nourriture** : Vérifiez le processus de génération et de placement de la nourriture sur la grille. Assurez-vous que \`createFood\` génère des coordonnées qui ne chevauchent pas celles du serpent. Cela peut ne pas être directement lié à l'erreur actuelle, mais peut prévenir des erreurs de logique de jeu futures. 3. **Initialisation et Réinitialisation** : Le processus de démarrage (\`start\`) et de réinitialisation peut être à l'origine de problèmes si le jeu n'est pas remis à un état cohérent. Assurez-vous que toutes les entités du jeu, y compris le serpent et la nourriture, sont correctement initialisées. 4. **Debugging** : Utilisez des points d'arrêt et des logs afin de déterminer exactement où et quand l'erreur se produit. Cela pourrait révéler une opération spécifique qui tente d'accéder à un élément inexistant dans la grille ou dans les listes associées au modèle du serpent. 5. **Construction de l'Interface** : Bien que moins probable étant donné la description de l'erreur, inspectez également le processus de construction de l'interface utilisateur (UI), particulièrement le \`GridView.builder\`, afin de vous assurer qu'il ne tente pas d'accéder à des indices ou à des éléments de la grille qui pourraient ne pas exister. 6. **Review du Code Concernant le Mouvement du Serpent** : Le mouvement et l'agrandissement du serpent sont des actions critiques qui pourraient introduire des états incohérents si mal gérés.

Passons en revue les points principaux qui pourraient causer cela : # 1. Mise à jour Incorrecte de la Grille Dans la méthode \`moveSnake()\` de \`SnakeModel\`, vous insérez d'abord la nouvelle position de tête dans \`bodyPositions\` avant d'effectuer le mouvement. Cependant, vous ne mettez pas à jour la grille (\`gameModel.grid\`) pour montrer la nouvelle position du serpent après le mouvement. Cela signifie que bien que le serpent se déplace logiquement (ses coordonnées \`x\` et \`y\` changent), ces changements ne sont pas reflétés visuellement. # 2. Confusion entre les Coordonnées \`x\` et \`y\` Lorsque vous déterminez les coordonnées \`x\` et \`y\` à partir de l'index dans votre \`GridView.builder\`, vous avez: \`\`\`dart int y = index ~/ GameModel.NB_COLONNES; int x = index - ((index ~/ GameModel.NB_COLONNES) * GameModel.NB_COLONNES); \`\`\` Cela est correct, mais il est important de s'assurer que ces conventions \`x\` (colonne) et \`y\` (ligne) sont cohérentes partout dans votre code. Par exemple, en ajoutant ou en enlevant de la grille, assurez-vous que vous utilisez \`y\` pour les lignes et \`x\` pour les colonnes respectivement. Il semble y avoir une incohérence dans \`moveSnake\` quand \`bodyPositions.removeLast()\` est utilisé mais pas mis à jour correctement sur la grille. # 3. Mise à jour Correcte de la Grille Dans votre méthode \`displaySnake()\`, vous n'avez pas mis à jour \`gameModel.grid\` pour montrer les nouvelles positions du corps du serpent. Vous devez itérer sur \`bodyPositions\` et assigner \`GameModel.SNAKE_BODY\` ou \`GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD\` à chaque position appropriée sur la grille. Assurez-vous également de remettre à 0 les emplacements précédents du serpent sur la grille pour éviter des affichages incorrects. # Solution Potentielle Vous devriez ajouter une logique dans \`displaySnake()\` pour nettoyer l'ancienne position du serpent sur la grille et la mettre à jour avec les nouvelles positions. Voici une version simplifiée de ce que cela pourrait être : \`\`\`dart void displaySnake() { // Nettoyer l'ancienne position for(var position in bodyPositionsOld) { gameModel.grid[position[1]][position[0]] = 0; } // Mettre à jour la grille avec les nouvelles positions du serpent for (var position in bodyPositions) { gameModel.grid[position[1]][position[0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_BODY; // Utilisez SNAKE_HEAD pour la tête } // N'oubliez pas de marquer la première position comme SNAKE_HEAD if(bodyPositions.isNotEmpty) { var head = bodyPositions.first; gameModel.grid[head[1]][head[0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; } } \`\`\` Veillez à bien séparer les coordonnées \`x\` (colonne) et \`y\` (ligne) dans votre logique, surtout lorsque vous travaillez avec \`gameModel.grid\`. En corrégeant ces points, le mouvement et la croissance du serpent devraient se refléter visuellement dans votre interface utilisateur."},{"prompt":"Unlike dynasties like the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Song, and even the Yuan and Ming, why did the Qing Dynasty expand its borders and territories into what is now Mongolia, Xinjiang (and Dzungaria), Tibet and Taiwan? Why didn't other dynasties do this, while the Qing did?","completion":"The Qing Dynasty expanded its borders for several reasons: 1. Military power: The Qing Dynasty was established by the Manchu people, who were warlike and had a strong military tradition. This allowed them to conquer and annex neighboring territories more easily compared to previous dynasties. 2. Economic motives: The Qing Dynasty sought to control valuable resources and trade routes in regions like Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan. By expanding their territories, they were able to increase their wealth and power. 3. Strategic considerations: The Qing Dynasty wanted to secure their borders and prevent incursions from rival powers, such as the Russian Empire and Central Asian tribes. By expanding into these areas, they were able to create buffer zones and strengthen their defenses. 4. Ideological reasons: The Qing Dynasty believed in the concept of Mandate of Heaven, which held that the Emperor had the divine right to rule over all lands. By expanding their territories, they were able to fulfill this belief and solidify their legitimacy as rulers. In contrast, previous dynasties like the Song and Ming were more focused on consolidating their power within China proper and did not prioritize territorial expansion. They also faced internal unrest and external threats, which limited their ability to expand beyond their borders. Additionally, the geography and political landscape of these regions made it more challenging for previous dynasties to successfully conquer and control them."},{"prompt":"What exactly was the relations between Qing Dynasty China and the Mongols in what is now today Mongolia and Inner Mongolia? And what were the relations between these Mongol peoples and the Dzungars and other Oirat Mongols in the Dzungar Khanate?","completion":"The relations between the Qing Dynasty and the Mongols in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia were complex and evolved over time. The Qing Dynasty initially faced resistance from the Mongols when they first conquered China in the mid-17th century. However, the Qing rulers eventually established control over the Mongol regions and incorporated them into the Qing Empire. The Qing Dynasty implemented a policy of divide and rule, where they appointed Mongol nobles as local rulers and granted them autonomy in exchange for their loyalty to the Qing government. This helped to maintain stability and prevent uprisings among the Mongol population. In Inner Mongolia, the Qing Dynasty established the Eight Banners system, which was a military and administrative organization that included Mongol, Manchu, and Han Chinese troops. The Mongols were integrated into the Eight Banners and played a significant role in the Qing military and government. The relations between the Mongols and the Dzungars, who were Oirat Mongols ruling the Dzungar Khanate in what is now Xinjiang and parts of Mongolia, were often characterized by conflict and competition. The Dzungars were traditional rivals of the Qing Dynasty and frequently clashed with the Qing forces over control of territories and resources. In the early 18th century, the Qing Dynasty launched a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars, culminating in the Qing conquest of the Dzungar Khanate in 1755. The defeat of the Dzungars marked the end of their independence and their territories were incorporated into the Qing Empire. Overall, the relations between the Qing Dynasty, the Mongols in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, and the Dzungars were shaped by a combination of military conquest, diplomacy, and political alliances. The Qing Dynasty sought to maintain control over these regions through a combination of military force and political manipulation, while also incorporating the Mongol and Oirat populations into the Qing administrative and military structures."},{"prompt":"The Empire of Japan had supported Manchurian independence in the hope to divide and weaken Qing Dynasty China. Were there other times Japan supported independence movements, or other conflicts in order to destabilize, weaken, and divide China?","completion":"Yes, Japan has a history of supporting independence movements and conflicts in order to destabilize, weaken, and divide China. Some notable instances include: 1. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895): Japan's victory in this war marked the first time a modern Asian power defeated a European power (Qing Dynasty China) in a war. Japan's primary goal was to gain control over Korea and Taiwan, as well as to weaken China's influence in the region. The Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the war forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan and recognize Korea's independence. 2. The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905): Japan's victory over Russia in this war further solidified its position as a major regional power and allowed Japan to expand its influence in East Asia. Japan's support for Korean independence movements and its desire to weaken Russian influence in the region were key factors in the conflict. 3. World War II: During World War II, Japan invaded and occupied parts of China, including Manchuria, in an effort to expand its empire and weaken Chinese resistance. Japan's brutal occupation of China resulted in widespread devastation and loss of life. 4. Support for Taiwanese independence: In more recent times, Japan has expressed support for Taiwanese independence, which has strained its relations with China. Japan's support for Taiwan's independence movement is seen as a way to counter China's growing influence in the region. Overall, Japan's history of supporting independence movements and conflicts in China has been driven by a combination of strategic, political, and territorial interests. These actions have often been aimed at weakening China's power and influence in the region, while also advancing Japan's own geopolitical goals."},{"prompt":"How did allies before, during, and after the World Wars work? Despite the Russo-Japanese War, Russia and Japan were considered allies in World War 1, simultaneously being alongside the United States, the UK, France and Italy and against Germany (German Empire) and its allies, but Japan would soon ally with Nazi Germany and Italy?","completion":"The dynamics of alliances before, during, and after the World Wars were complex and often driven by shifting geopolitical interests and alliances of convenience. Here is a brief overview of how alliances worked during these periods: Before World War I: - In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European powers formed alliances to protect their interests and maintain a balance of power on the continent. - The Triple Entente, consisting of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, was formed to counter the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. - Japan, seeking to expand its influence in East Asia, formed an alliance with the UK in 1902 and later with Russia in 1907. During World War I: - When World War I broke out in 1914, the alliances were put into action. Russia, France, and the UK (along with their colonies) formed the Allies, while Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire formed the Central Powers. - Japan, as an ally of the UK and Russia, joined the war on the side of the Allies and declared war on Germany in 1914. - Despite their previous conflict in the Russo-Japanese War, Russia and Japan fought together as allies during World War I. After World War I: - Following the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, officially ending the war and imposing harsh penalties on Germany. - Japan, as one of the victorious Allied powers, gained territories and influence in East Asia as a result of the treaty. - However, Japan's relations with the Western powers began to deteriorate in the interwar period, leading to Japan's increasing militarization and expansionist policies. Before World War II: - In the lead-up to World War II, Japan pursued an aggressive foreign policy, expanding its empire through military conquests in China and Southeast Asia. - Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in 1940, forming an alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. This alliance was driven by shared anti-communist sentiments and a desire to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and the Western powers. During World War II: - Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy during World War II placed it on the Axis side, fighting against the Allied powers, including the US, UK, Soviet Union, and China. - Japan's military actions in East Asia and the Pacific, including the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, drew the US into the war and led to a prolonged and devastating conflict in the region. Overall, the alliances before, during, and after the World Wars were shaped by a complex interplay of political, military, and strategic considerations, leading to shifting alliances and conflicts among major powers."},{"prompt":"Complete the sentences with the -ing form or to • infinitive of the verbs in brackets. 1 If the soup doesn't taste very good, try (add) some salt.\\" 2 We regret : (inform) you that your application has not been accepted. 3 On the way to the cinema I stopped (buy! the cinema guide. 4 The students couldn't help laughing when they saw I'd forgotten (put) my socks on in the morning. 5 This place looks familiar, I remember (come) here before. 6 You're too slow, Peter.

Introduites dans ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), les fonctions fléchées offrent une syntaxe plus courte pour déclarer des fonctions et elles partagent le même contexte lexical \`this\` que le code qui les entoure. Cela les rend particulièrement utiles pour les callbacks et les fonctions qui sont utilisées dans des méthodes d'arrays comme map, filter, et reduce. Voici la structure de base d'une fonction fléchée : \`\`\`javascript const nomDeLaFonction = (param1, param2, ...) => { // Corps de la fonction }; \`\`\` Si la fonction ne prend qu'un seul argument, les parenthèses autour des paramètres sont facultatives : \`\`\`javascript const carre = x => x * x; \`\`\` Quand une fonction fléchée contient une seule instruction qui retourne une valeur, les accolades \`{}\` et le mot-clé \`return\` peuvent être omis : \`\`\`javascript const additionner = (a, b) => a + b; \`\`\` Un avantage notable des fonctions fléchées est leur comportement vis-à-vis du mot-clé \`this\`. Contrairement aux fonctions traditionnelles, le \`this\` dans une fonction fléchée est déterminé par le contexte lexical dans lequel la fonction est créée, et non par la manière dont elle est appelée. Cela les rend particulièrement utiles pour les méthodes où le contexte \`this\` est important et ne doit pas changer, comme les gestionnaires d'événements ou les callbacks. Considérations importantes concernant les fonctions fléchées : - Les fonctions fléchées ne sont pas nommées (sauf si elles sont assignées à une variable), ce qui peut rendre le debugging légèrement plus difficile. - Elles ne peuvent pas être utilisées comme constructeurs (vous ne pouvez pas utiliser le mot-clé \`new\` avec une fonction fléchée). - Elles ne possèdent pas leur propre objet \`arguments\`, mais vous pouvez accéder à un objet \`arguments\` de la portée englobante. La concision et la simplicité des fonctions fléchées en font un outil populaire pour écrire un code JavaScript plus lisible et plus fonctionnel."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Одним из ключевых критериев интегрируемости по Риману является Критерий Лебега, согласно которому функция интегрируема по Риману на отрезке [a, b] тогда и только тогда, когда она ограничена на [a, b] и множество её точек разрыва имеет меру нуль. Мера Лебега множества – это обобщение понятия длины интервала или площади фигуры на более сложные множества. Множество имеет меру нуль, если его можно покрыть счётным числом интервалов сколь угодно малой суммарной длины. Исходя из формулировки вопроса, рассматривается функция, которая разрывна на некотором непустом открытом множестве на интервале [a, b]. Основная проблема здесь состоит в том, что открытое множество не может иметь меру нуль, если оно непустое, поскольку любое открытое непустое множество на вещественной оси содержит интервал, длина которого положительна. Это означает, что если функция разрывна во всех точках такого непустого открытого множества, тогда множество точек её разрыва не может иметь меру нуль. Таким образом, согласно Критерию Лебега, функция, разрывная во всех точках некоторого непустого открытого множества на [a, b], не может быть интегрируемой по Риману на этом отрезке, поскольку для интегрируемости по Риману необходимо, чтобы множество точек разрыва имело меру нуль, а в данном случае оно явно имеет меру, превышающую нуль."},{"prompt":"Пусть 𝐸 – замкнутое множество меры нуль на [𝑎, 𝑏]. Интегрируема ли его характеристическая функция 𝒳𝐸(𝑡) на [𝑎, 𝑏]?","completion":"Характеристическая функция множества (E), обозначаемая как (chi_E(t)), определена следующим образом: она равна 1, если (t) принадлежит множеству (E), и 0 в противном случае. При рассмотрении вопроса об интегрируемости по Риману такой функции на интервале ([a, b]), ключевую роль играет её поведение на этом интервале. Множество (E) замкнуто и имеет меру нуль. Согласно критерию Лебега интегрируемости функции по Риману, функция интегрируема на ([a, b]) тогда и только тогда, когда она ограничена на этом отрезке и множество её точек разрыва имеет меру нуль. Характеристическая функция (chi_E(t)) ограничена на ([a, b]), так как она принимает только значения 0 и 1. Поскольку (E) — замкнутое множество меры нуль, то любые точки разрыва функции (chi_E(t)) могут возникать только на границах множеств, где функция меняет своё значение с 0 на 1 или с 1 на 0, т.е. в точках множества (E). Поскольку множество (E) имеет меру нуль, то и множество точек разрыва характеристической функции имеет меру нуль. Исходя из этого, можно сделать вывод, что характеристическая функция (chi_E(t)) интегрируема по Риману на ([a, b]), поскольку она удовлетворяет условиям критерия Лебега: она ограничена, а множество её точек разрыва имеет меру нуль."},{"prompt":"Проверить интегрируемы ли на [0,1] по Риману функции: 𝑥1(𝑡) = {𝑡^2,𝑡 − иррац.;𝑡^3,𝑡 − рац. 𝑥2(𝑡) = {𝑡^2, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 > 1/3);𝑡^3, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 < 1/3);𝑡^4, (𝑡 − рац). 𝑥3(𝑡) = {sin 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [0,1/2] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [1/2,1] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);sin 𝜋𝑡 + cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ 𝐾.

Если да, то вычислить интеграл Лебега","completion":"Для каждой из этих функций рассмотрим отдельно их интегрируемость по Риману и по Лебегу на отрезке ([0, 1]). # Функция (x_1(t)) - **Интегрируемость по Риману**: Точки, где функция (x_1(t)) различается ((t^2) для иррациональных (t) и (t^3) для рациональных (t)), формируют множество точек разрыва, которое по сути является объединением всех рациональных и иррациональных чисел на ([0, 1]). Однако, рациональные числа образуют счетное множество, которое имеет меру нуль, это не нарушает критерий Лебега для интегрируемости по Риману. Тем не менее, изменение функции на наборе рациональных чисел не позволяет ей удовлетворять определению Римана об интегрируемости, так как любое разбиение отрезка будет содержать точки, в которых функция имеет различные значения. Поэтому, с математической строгостью, функция (x_1(t)) не интегрируема по Риману. - **Интегрируемость по Лебегу**: Функция (x_1(t)) является измеримой, так как она чётко определена на всём интервале. Поэтому, её можно интегрировать по Лебегу. # Функция (x_2(t)) - **Интегрируемость по Риману**: Для (x_2(t)), условия определения меняются в зависимости от рациональности (t) и его положения относительно точки (1/3). Так как точки разрыва состоят из счетного объединения рациональных чисел и непрерывных переходов между частями в зависимости от значений (t), эта функция, строго говоря, также не удовлетворяет условиям интегрируемости по Риману из-за разнообразия значений в точках разрыва на отрезке. - **Интегрируемость по Лебегу**: Функция (x_2(t)) также измерима, и, учитывая, что особые точки имеют меру нуль (рациональные числа), её интеграл по Лебегу можно вычислить. # Функция (x_3(t)) - **Интегрируемость по Риману**: Функция (x_3(t)) меняет свое поведение в зависимости от того, принадлежит ли (t) канторову множеству (mathcal{K}). Канторово множество имеет меру нуль, поэтому изменения функции (x_3(t)) в точках канторова множества влияют на интегрируемость по Риману в меньшей степени. То есть, для всех других целей, функция непрерывна на ([0, 1]), и может считаться интегрируемой по Риману. - **Интегрируемость по Лебегу**: Функция (x_3(t)) измерима и, учитывая, что особые точки, где она определена через (sin pi t + cos pi t), имеют меру нуль, её также можно интегрировать по Лебегу. **Вычисление интеграла Лебега**: Для точного вычисления интеграла Лебега каждой из функций, необходима более детальная информация о способе обработки каждого случая. Однако, для функций, которые в основном определяются классическими полиномиальными выражениями за исключением множеств меры нуль, их интегралы по Лебегу будут эквивалентны классическим интегралам их полиномиальных частей на ([0, 1]), игнорируя множества меры нуль. Канторово множество и множество рациональных чисел в ([0, 1]) имеют меру нуль, поэтому вклад от изменений функций в этих точках будет нулевым."},{"prompt":"вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции 𝑥1(𝑡) = {𝑡^2,𝑡 − иррац.;𝑡^3,𝑡 − рац. на [0,1]","completion":"Чтобы вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции (x_1(t)), определенной как (x_1(t) = begin{cases} t^2, & t - text{иррациональное} t^3, & t - text{рациональное} end{cases}) на интервале ([0,1]), важно понимать, что множество рациональных чисел на любом отрезке вещественной оси является счетным, и, следовательно, имеет меру нуль по Лебегу. Это означает, что для вычисления интеграла Лебега по всему интервалу мы можем сосредоточиться на функции (t^2), так как вклад от (t^3) (при рациональных (t)) будет пренебрежимо малым, поскольку множество рациональных чисел имеет меру нуль. Таким образом, интеграл Лебега для (x_1(t)) на интервале от 0 до 1 фактически сводится к вычислению интеграла от (t^2) на этом интервале, что является классической задачей интегрирования. Интеграл от (t^2) по (t) от 0 до 1 равен: [ int_{0}^{1} t^2 , dt = left.frac{t^3}{3}right|_{0}^{1} = frac{1^3}{3} - frac{0^3}{3} = frac{1}{3} ] Таким образом, интеграл Лебега функции (x_1(t)) на интервале ([0, 1]) равен (frac{1}{3})."},{"prompt":"вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции 𝑥2(𝑡) = {𝑡^2, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 > 1/3);𝑡^3, (𝑡 − иррац)⋀(𝑡 < 1/3);𝑡^4, (𝑡 − рац) на [0,1]","completion":"Для вычисления интеграла Лебега функции (x_2(t)), определённой как: [x_2(t) = left{ begin{array}{ll} t^2, & (t - text{иррац}) wedge (t > frac{1}{3}); t^3, & (t - text{иррац}) wedge (t < frac{1}{3}); t^4, & (t - text{рац}), end{array} right.] на интервале ([0,1]), нужно учесть вклад каждой из функций в соответствии с их областями определения. - **Для (t^2):** Эта функция определяется для иррациональных значений (t) больше (frac{1}{3}). Поэтому, её вклад в интеграл будет интервалом от (frac{1}{3}) до 1 (включительно). - **Для (t^3):** Она применяется для иррациональных (t) меньше (frac{1}{3}) (не включая (frac{1}{3})). Принимая во внимание длину интервала, включаем его в интеграл по соответствующему интервалу от 0 до (frac{1}{3}). - **Для (t^4):** Эта часть функции определяется для рациональных значений (t). Несмотря на то что рациональные числа плотно заполняют весь интервал ([0, 1]), их мера (по Лебегу) равна нулю, и этот случай можно игнорировать при вычислении интеграла по Лебегу. Это подтверждает особенность интегрирования по Лебегу: множества меры нуль не влияют на значение интеграла. Поскольку практически весь вклад в интеграл исходит из функций, определенных для иррациональных чисел, рассмотрим эти два случая отдельно и интегрируем: 1. (t^2) на интервале от (frac{1}{3}) до 1: [ int_{frac{1}{3}}^{1} t^2 dt = left.frac{t^3}{3}right|_{frac{1}{3}}^{1} = frac{1}{3} - left(frac{1}{3}right)^3 frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{81} = frac{27}{81} - frac{1}{81} = frac{26}{81} ] 2. (t^3) на интервале от 0 до (frac{1}{3}): [ int_{0}^{frac{1}{3}} t^3 dt = left.frac{t^4}{4}right|_{0}^{frac{1}{3}} = left(frac{1}{3}right)^4 frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{81} cdot frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{324} ] Сложим эти два значения, чтобы получить общий интеграл Лебега для функции на интервале ([0,1]): [ text{Интеграл} = frac{26}{81} + frac{1}{324} = frac{104}{324} + frac{1}{324} = frac{105}{324} = frac{35}{108} ] Таким образом, интеграл Лебега функции (x_2(t)) на ([0,1]) составляет (frac{35}{108})."},{"prompt":"вычислить интеграл Лебега для функции 𝑥3(𝑡) = {sin 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [0,1/2] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ [1/2,1] ∩ ([0/1]𝐾);sin 𝜋𝑡 + cos 𝜋𝑡,𝑡 ∈ 𝐾 на [0,1]","completion":"Для вычисления интеграла Лебега функции (x_3(t)), заданной условиями [x_3(t) = left{ begin{aligned} &sin pi t, & t in [0,tfrac{1}{2}] cap ([0,1]setminusmathcal{K}); &cos pi t, & t in [tfrac{1}{2},1] cap ([0,1]setminusmathcal{K}); &sin pi t + cos pi t, & t in mathcal{K}, end{aligned} right.] на интервале ([0,1]), где (mathcal{K}) — Канторово множество, важно понимать распределение функции и особенностей множества (mathcal{K}). Поскольку Канторово множество (mathcal{K}) имеет меру Лебега нуль, вклад в интеграл от тех точек, где (t in mathcal{K}), будет игнорироваться при вычислении интеграла по Лебегу. Следовательно, интеграл по (x_3(t)) можно разбить на два основных интеграла, поскольку (t in [0,1]setminusmathcal{K}) для большей части интервала ([0,1]), а вклад от (t in mathcal{K}) будет равен нулю, учитывая, что (mathcal{K}) имеет меру нуль. **Вычисляем интегралы:** 1.

Transformer 구조 - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Transformer 구조의 핵심은 자기 주의(self-attention) 메커니즘에 있습니다. 이 메커니즘은 입력된 각 단어(또는 토큰)가 문장 내 다른 모든 단어와의 관계를 계산하게 해, 문맥을 깊이 이해할 수 있게 합니다. 따라서, 매우 적은 입력에 대해서도 그 문맥의 의미를 파악하여 풍부하고 관련성 높은 출력을 생성할 수 있습니다. - **Layered Structure**: Transformer 모델은 여러 층(layer)으로 구성되어 있으며, 각 계층은 복잡한 언어 패턴을 학습할 수 있습니다. 따라서, 입력에 대해 매우 세밀하고 복잡한 처리를 할 수 있으며, 이는 더 풍부하고 다양한 출력을 가능하게 합니다. # 2. 대량의 데이터에 대한 사전 훈련 (Pre-training) - **Language Modeling**: GPT와 같은 모델은 대규모 텍스트 코퍼스를 사용하여 사전 훈련됩니다. 이 훈련 과정에서 모델은 문맥적 단어 예측, 즉 주어진 문맥에서 다음에 올 단어를 예측하는 작업을 반복적으로 수행합니다. 이 과정으로 모델은 언어의 광범위한 패턴과 구조를 학습하게 되며, 이 지식을 바탕으로 적은 입력에도 불구하고 풍부한 문맥을 추론할 수 있게 됩니다. - **Fine-tuning**: 사전 훈련된 모델을 특정 작업이나 도메인에 맞게 추가적으로 훈련할 수 있습니다. 이 과정은 모델이 특정 주제나 분야에 더 잘 맞는 출력을 생성하는 데 도움이 됩니다. # 결론 적은 입력으로부터 풍부한 출력을 생성하는 능력은 GPT 모델의 Transformer 구조와 사전 훈련 과정의 결과입니다.

Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engineering †conference: arXiv; Feb 2024; Preprint †booktitle: arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint †price: 25.00 †isbn: arXiv †copyright: none 1.Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transforming the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours.

Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates. Model Reported EM Our EM@100 Delta Mistral-7B 0.52 0.41 − 0.11 Llama2-13B 0.29 0.43 + 0.13 Llama2-70B 0.57 0.61 + 0.04 Table 6.Comparing the reported scores for each model as reported by the model publishers on the whole GSM8K test set against the best average score we were able to achieve across our optimization and evaluation subsets, which accounted for about 15% of the test set. 6.Future Work This work could easily be expanded with additional prompt variants, models, and datasets. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating “positive thinking” into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of “positive thinking” prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engineering †conference: arXiv; Feb 2024; Preprint †booktitle: arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint †price: 25.00 †isbn: arXiv †copyright: none 1.Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transforming the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours. Openers None You are as smart as ChatGPT. You are highly intelligent. You are an expert mathematician. You are a professor of mathematics. Table 1.Opening snippets for the system message.

Take a deep breath and think carefully. I really need your help! Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates.

However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

Imagine we are talking about how best to ask an incredibly smart robot assistant named LLM (Large Language Model) for help, specifically with solving math problems. # License & Basic Info The document you mentioned at the start (like \\"CC BY 4.0\\" and \\"arXiv:2402.10949v2\\") is basically telling you where the information comes from and under what rules you can use it. It's from a big library of free research papers called arXiv, and this particular one is about language and computers. The \\"CC BY 4.0\\" part says you can share and adapt the info as long as you give appropriate credit. # The Big Idea of the Research The main focus here is on finding the best way to communicate a task to a computer program designed to understand and use language, called a Large Language Model (LLM), to make it solve math problems more accurately. The research is comparing two main strategies: 1. Adding \\"positive thinking\\" vibes into the instructions we give it. 2. Using a systematic way to improve how we phrase our questions (called \\"prompt optimization\\"). Imagine you're trying to encourage a friend to solve a tricky puzzle. First, you try cheering them on with positive vibes vs. giving them a more effective strategy. It's a bit like that but with computer programs. # What They Found - For some of the tasks, cheering on the LLM with \\"positive thinking\\" actually helped it do better. But this wasn't true for all the tasks or LLM versions they tried. - The systematic approach to rephrasing the questions (prompt optimization) generally worked better across the board, especially for more complex questions. # Making It Weird (But Effective) A surprising part of their findings was that sometimes the most effective way to ask the LLMs to solve a problem was to phrase the questions in very unexpected ways. For example, they found that asking the LLM to imagine it's plotting a course through space (like in a sci-fi movie) helped it solve math problems more accurately. It's as if by making the tasks into a story or game, the LLM could understand and solve them better. # Why It's Important Communication is key, even with robots. Finding the best ways to ask these intelligent programs to help us can make them much more useful. Whether it's helping kids with homework, assisting researchers, or solving everyday problems, improving how we interact with these AI systems can have big benefits. In a nutshell, this research is like figuring out the right way to ask a super-smart robot for help so that it understands exactly what we need and can give us the best answers. And sometimes, making it fun and creative works better than we might expect!"},{"prompt":"I was thinking about visual tokenisation for language model's compatible images representation. • split input image into chunks; • for each chunk generate visual embedding vector (including positional relationship and contextualised information); (during training phase) • save encountered embeddings for all chunks of all images in dataset; • use k-means to group similar vectors; • for each K save pair id and weighed average of vector embeddings in clusters; (during visual tokenizer downstream use) • tokenizer receive input image, split into chunks, embed patches and finds closest in it's dictionary; • tokenizer output is a linearized visual tokens sequence with line separator (to get 1d from 2d matrix of chunks); This representation is used for downstream tasks, including language modelling with mixture of text with visual information. Of course, we can add more vectorized representation (in addition to previously described, which works with pixel grid) - let's say, we have an image and we want to represent it using graphical primitives (lines, curves, shapes, strokes, dots, etc) with parameters (position, rotation, scale by Oxy, z-index and, probably, colour scheme) optimized to minimize error between source image and reconstructed (rasterized) from representation. May I ask for analytical decomposition of proposed approach?","completion":"The approach you've outlined represents a sophisticated method for converting images into a form that can be used by language models, bridging the divide between visual and textual data. Let's break it down analytically: # Stage 1: Preprocessing and Embedding Generation 1. **Splitting Input Image into Chunks**: This initial step involves dividing the image into smaller, more manageable segments or patches. The granularity of these chunks can significantly influence the subsequent processing, with finer divisions potentially capturing more detail at the cost of increased computational complexity. 2. **Generating Visual Embedding Vector**: Each chunk is then processed to generate a visual embedding that encapsulates not just the raw pixel information but also contextual and positional nuances. This embedding process is crucial for capturing the inherent semantics of the visual data, akin to how word embeddings capture linguistic context in text. # Stage 2: Clustering and Dictionary Formation (Training Phase) 1. **Saving Encountered Embeddings**: This entails storing the embeddings for all image chunks encountered during the training phase, essentially creating a vast database of visual vectors. 2. **Clustering Similar Vectors with K-means**: The use of K-means clustering aims to identify natural groupings among these vectors, effectively determining common patterns or motifs across the dataset. This step is vital for abstracting the embeddings into a more manageable set of categories. 3. **Dictionary Creation**: For each cluster, an identifier and a weighted average vector are saved. This step effectively creates a condensed representation of the visual data, simplifying the vast array of encountered embeddings into a discrete set of 'visual tokens'. # Stage 3: Tokenization (Downstream Use) 1. **Image Tokenization**: Given a new input image, the tokenizer repeats the chunking and embedding generation process. It then matches these fresh embeddings to the most similar ones in its dictionary, thus translating the visual data into a sequence of predefined tokens. 2. **Linearization**: The output is a linearized sequence of visual tokens, with a line separator employed to maintain the two-dimensional structure's integrity in a one-dimensional form. This conversion facilitates the integration of visual data into models originally designed for textual input. # Alternative Representation: Graphical Primitives The proposal also includes an alternative method of representation using graphical primitives (lines, curves, shapes, etc.). This vectorized representation aims to minimize the difference between the original image and a reconstructed version made from these primitives, focusing on key attributes like position, rotation, and color scheme. # Analytical Decomposition: - **Complexity**: The approach is computationally intensive, given the initial high-dimensional embeddings and the need for clustering across potentially large datasets. The efficiency of the embedding and clustering steps is crucial. - **Generalization vs. Detail Retention**: The balance between capturing generic patterns (via clustering) and retaining sufficient detail to accurately represent each image is central to the effectiveness of this method. The granularity of initial chunking and the choice of K in K-means clustering are pivotal decisions. - **Versatility and Application Scope**: The method's ability to bridge visual and textual data opens up a vast application scope, including but not limited to image captioning, multimedia search, and cross-modal information retrieval. - **Alternative Representations**: The consideration of alternative, non-pixel-based representations (like graphical primitives) is innovative, potentially offering more efficient or interpretable models for certain types of visual data. However, the challenge lies in the accurate and efficient extraction of these primitives from raw images. # Conclusion The proposed approach for visual tokenization is ambitious and potentially transformative, enabling deep integration of visual and textual data in language models. Its success hinges on effective execution of the embedding, clustering, and tokenization processes, as well as the ability to balance detail retention with generalization. Further, exploring alternative representations opens additional avenues for research and application, albeit with their own sets of challenges and opportunities."},{"prompt":"Sounds good. There was another matter I was wondering for awhile now. It is on how to propose a user more natural interface for chat bots (LLM or transformers based). Initial idea is to make them work somewhat more asynchronously (and we need to work out what does that mean in our case), than pair with an digital avatar (animated 2d or proper 3d, extra cool approach - as an actor in fully physical simulated environment, including mimicking user's surrounding wia AR/XR approach). It is an multimodal approach, of course, as it's require mapping stream (part of async IO - we need to split it on a fly, without waiting pauses) of users input (text typing, audio messages, image photos, or even video \\"call\\" scenarios, where we need to extract user's locomotions and body language as a part of preprocessing). On output side we can produce text (including chat messages and downloadable documents), audio (imitating \\"recorded\\" voice messages, or synthetic acoustic files if task requires) and controls for avatar (probably, wia language modelling applied to body language and locomotions, aligned with output text (if \\"muted\\")/speech). This should allow better user experience. Of course, it's a shallow take which requires a further search in a solutions space. What do you think?","completion":"The concept of enhancing a chatbot interface to be more user-friendly and natural by employing asynchronous communication paired with a digital avatar—whether 2D, 3D, or within a physically simulated environment augmented by AR/XR technologies—is both ambitious and forward-thinking. This multimodal approach aims to bring a deeper, more intuitive interaction method that bridges the gap between human communication nuances and the digital realm. Let’s explore the proposal from several key aspects: # Asynchronous Communication Defined for Chatbots Asynchronous communication for chatbots means the system does not require an immediate response from the user to progress. It can handle inputs at any time and respond appropriately when ready. This paradigm mirrors human conversations more closely, where pauses and shifts in topics can occur naturally without disrupting the flow of interaction. Implementing this would require the bot to maintain context over extended periods and manage multiple threads of conversation simultaneously. # Integrating Digital Avatars Pairing the chatbot with a digital avatar requires significant advancements in emotive AI and real-time rendering technologies. For 2D or 3D avatars, synchronizing the avatar’s expressions and movements with the chatbot’s responses enhances the feeling of interacting with a sentient being. A fully physical simulated environment, possibly enhanced with AR/XR to mirror the user's surroundings, represents the pinnacle of this concept, offering a deeply immersive and personalized experience. # Multimodal Input and Output Processing Being multimodal, the system must efficiently process varied inputs — text, voice, images, and videos. On the input side, understanding and contextualizing these different data types involve: - **Text and Voice**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to comprehend and infer user intent. - **Images and Videos**: Computer Vision techniques to extract meaningful information, e.g., identifying objects or interpreting user emotions through facial recognition. The output side needs to be equally diverse, with text responses, voice messages (synthesized to sound natural or human-like), and avatar animations that can embody speech or body language. This requires a tight integration between the output modalities and real-time processing to ensure responses are synchronous and contextually relevant. # Challenges and Considerations 1. **Real-Time Processing**: The system must process and respond to inputs in real-time or near-real-time, requiring significant computational resources and sophisticated AI models. 2. **Contextual Understanding and Memory**: Maintaining conversation context, especially in an asynchronous setting with multimodal inputs, is complex. The system must remember past interactions and incorporate this context into future responses. 3. **Personalization and User Privacy**: Personalizing interactions while respecting user privacy and ensuring data security will be pivotal. Users must trust the system with sensitive information for the most natural interaction. 4. **Scalability**: Handling multiple users simultaneously, each potentially having long-term, ongoing conversations, poses scalability challenges. 5. **Technological Integration**: Combining voice synthesis, NLP, computer vision, and AR/XR technologies into a cohesive, efficient system is a technical challenge that involves navigating the limitations and compatibilities of existing technologies. # Conclusion Your proposal outlines a visionary leap towards making digital interactions more natural and engaging. Success in this domain would not only elevate user experience but could also redefine how we perceive and interact with AI, making it an integral, seamless part of our daily lives. However, realizing this vision requires addressing significant technological, ethical, and practical challenges. The journey towards more natural user interfaces for chatbots encompasses continuous research, innovation, and a multidisciplinary approach to overcome these hurdles."},{"prompt":"Do you know about unified audiolingual models? I'm interested in their application as a backend for chat bots, capable of any combinations of text and audio input-output. I know, that one of promising approaches is GPT-like language model architecture with pipelines for audio encoding (convert audio into semantic tokens sequence and fuse with text input using shared tokens codebook) and decoding (generates Mel spectrogram using semantic tokens stream, usually split into audio frames, so they can be generated autoregressively as a part of sampling strategy); bonus - this audiolinguistic model can be trained on audio natively, learning non writeable aspects of speech, and even general sounds understanding. So, end user can \\"speak\\" to them (voice message) and recive spoken out answer, or something text related (depending on task and how fitting it to use one or other). May you elaborate on this direction?","completion":"Unified audiolingual models represent an innovative stride in enhancing natural language processing (NLP) capabilities by integrating both audio and textual data into a single framework. This approach allows for a seamless processing of multimodal inputs and outputs, making it an ideal backbone for sophisticated chatbots capable of handling spoken and written language interchangeably. Here’s an in-depth look at how these models function and their potential applications: # Core Principles of Unified Audiolingual Models These models are designed to understand and generate both speech and text through a unified architecture, often inspired by the Transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The model architecture typically includes: - **Audio Encoding**: Converts spoken input into a sequence of semantic tokens that can be processed alongside textual input. This involves an initial step of speech recognition, where the raw audio is transformed into a more structured format (e.g., Mel spectrograms), and then into semantic tokens using a shared codebook. - **Text and Audio Integration**: Utilizes a shared representation (codebook) for both text and audio inputs, allowing the model to understand and process them within a single framework. This integration enables the model to be trained on a diverse dataset comprising both textual and auditory information. - **Audio Decoding**: Generates outputs in audio form (spoken language) from the sequence of semantic tokens. This often involves synthesizing speech from Mel spectrograms or equivalent audio representations generated by the model. # Training Unified Audiolingual Models Training these models involves a few key strategies: - **Multimodal Dataset**: The model is trained on a large, diverse dataset that includes both text and audio inputs. This allows it to learn the nuances of language in written and spoken forms, including aspects of speech that are not easily captured in writing such as tone, pitch, and emotion. - **Learning Non-Writable Aspects of Speech**: By training on audio data, the model can capture subtleties of speech like intonation, prosody, and other paralinguistic elements, enriching the communication capabilities of chatbots. - **General Sounds Understanding**: Beyond speech, some models are also trained to recognize and interpret general sonic inputs, such as ambient sounds or non-verbal vocalizations, broadening the scope of applications. # Applications in Chatbots Unified audiolingual models can vastly improve chatbot interfaces by supporting: - **Natural Conversational Experiences**: Users can interact with the chatbot either by typing or speaking, according to their preference or context, making the interaction more accessible and natural. - **Richer Responses**: Depending on the user's input mode and the context, the chatbot can choose the most suitable response format—be it spoken word for quick queries or text for information that is better consumed visually, such as detailed instructions or links. - **Cross-Modal Interactions**: The model can switch modalities within a conversation, such as receiving a voice command and responding with text (or vice versa), enhancing flexibility and usability. - **Learning from Conversational Context**: By processing both text and audio, these models can better understand the context and nuances of the conversation, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. # Challenges and Future Directions While promising, developing and deploying unified audiolingual models pose several challenges: - **Computational Requirements**: The complexity of processing and integrating audio and text inputs requires significant computational resources, making optimization a key area of research. - **Data Privacy and Security**: Handling voice and text data, especially in personal or sensitive contexts, raises significant privacy and security concerns that must be addressed. - **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**: Capturing the vast array of human languages, dialects, and accents remains a challenge, necessitating extensive and diverse training datasets. Unified audiolingual models are poised to revolutionize chatbot interfaces and other AI applications by providing more natural, flexible, and accessible ways to interact with technology. As research and development in this field advance, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated and human-like AI systems."},{"prompt":"What about possible general \\"audio modelling\\" capabilities? E.g. non-lingustic audio domain tasks, including multichannel ones. Think about entertainment, industrial, medical applications. Better write response as an essay and prefer expert level depth while doing so (reason - it's often simpler to write as best as possible, and only then adapt for target audience)","completion":"Emerging developments in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing the field of audio modeling, expanding its utility far beyond traditional language processing tasks. As we delve into the realms of entertainment, industry, and medicine, the nuanced capabilities of deep learning models to interpret, generate, and enhance audio signals are unveiling transformative applications. This essay aims to explore the depths of general audio modeling, focusing on non-linguistic audio domain tasks and their multifaceted applications across various sectors. # Advanced Audio Modeling in Entertainment In the entertainment industry, audio modeling is pivotal in creating immersive experiences for audiences. Sophisticated deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating high-fidelity music and sound effects tailored to specific themes or emotions. These AI-driven compositions not only facilitate the creation of dynamic soundtracks for films, games, and virtual reality environments but also enable real-time adjustment of audio content in response to user interactions or environmental changes. Furthermore, models trained on vast datasets can mimic the styles of specific composers or genres, offering personalized audio experiences. Another leap forward is the simulation of acoustics in virtual environments. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), adept at handling spatial data, can model the way sound interacts with various materials and surfaces, thereby accurately simulating sound propagation and reverberation in 3D spaces. This technology is instrumental in both enhancing the realism of virtual environments and in architectural acoustics, where it aids in designing spaces with optimal sound characteristics before physical construction begins. # Audio Modeling in Industrial Applications Industrial settings benefit significantly from audio modeling through predictive maintenance and environmental monitoring. Machine listening systems equipped with deep learning models can continuously analyze the sounds produced by machinery to detect abnormalities or changes that may indicate wear, malfunction, or failure. Anomaly detection models, trained on vast collections of normal operational sounds alongside examples of failure modes, can predictively flag potential issues, dramatically reducing downtime and maintenance costs. Sound-based environmental monitoring systems utilize similar principles, with models trained to recognize the acoustic signatures of various phenomena, such as wildlife presence, water flow rates, or vehicular traffic patterns. These systems provide invaluable data for managing natural resources, urban planning, and environmental conservation efforts, often in real-time and with minimal human intervention. # Innovations in Medical Audio Modeling In the medical domain, audio modeling is opening new frontiers in diagnostics and patient care. Deep learning models, particularly those employing time-series analysis capabilities, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are being developed to analyze sounds associated with the human body, such as heartbeats, breathing, and even vocal patterns. Applications range from early detection of respiratory conditions and cardiac anomalies to monitoring mental health through changes in speech patterns. The promise of non-invasive, continuous monitoring through audio sensors—whether embedded in smartphones, wearables, or ambient devices—offers the potential for early detection of health issues, enhanced patient care, and personalized medicine. Additionally, in telemedicine, audio analysis models ensure the quality of transmitted sounds, enabling accurate remote diagnosis and treatment. # Multichannel Audio Modeling The complexity and richness of audio information are often best captured through multichannel recordings, which provide spatial and directional nuances crucial for many applications. Deep learning models adept at processing multichannel audio are enhancing the capabilities of 3D audio rendering, essential for realistic virtual environments, and sophisticated audio surveillance systems, capable of pinpointing sound origins and movements within a monitored space. In medical applications, multichannel analyses facilitate more accurate modeling of bodily sounds, improving diagnostic capabilities. # Conclusion The expansive capabilities of advanced audio modeling are finding applications across a broad spectrum of domains, transcending the boundaries of traditional linguistic tasks. The fusion of cutting-edge machine learning techniques with audio processing is not only enriching the entertainment experience but is also pioneering solutions in industrial maintenance, environmental conservation, and medical diagnostics. As models become increasingly sophisticated and datasets grow richer, the potential for transformative advancements looms large on the horizon. Coupled with ethical considerations and a focus on augmenting human capabilities, the future of audio modeling promises to synergize technology and creativity, opening new vistas of innovation and application."},{"prompt":"Ok, let's take a closer look at audiovisual language models (AVLM). As was mentioned earlier, it's possible to perform mixed audio and language modelling using semantic tokens representation for audio. For visual input, it's also possible to do similar trick: 1. Collect representative images dataset 2. Split each image into chunks (simplest case is fixed sized, but more intricate designs are possible as well) 3. For each chunk generate embedding vector using visual model of some kind (e.g. ViT) Note: Visual tokens can be or not be aligned with linguistics. In second case, main language model will need to learn mapping on itself (kind of) 4. Store all the encountered visual vector embeddings and perform clustering (e.g. k-means) 5. For each cluster calculate center and save cluster_id-vector pairs as a \\"visual dictionary\\", with cluster id becoming visual token number 6. Using such visual vocabulary, we can perform image tokenisation by similar pipeline - splitting into chunks, calculate embedding, find closest cluster center and replace image chunk with visual token 7. Resulting tokens sequence can be linearised (with special tokens for image \\"frame\\" start, end and lines splitting), than mixed into language model input. Possibly with additional [relative] spatial positional embedding feed into transformer path, similar to positional information for regular text tokens sequence, but 2d instead of 1d. Note: Probably with spatial information (position of patch on source image), it is possible to provide masked part of image, or subset of tokens that important for task, saving tokens budget inside context window. 8. For output direction, it is possible to generate visual tokens sequence with LLM part (sampling for them autoregressively, filtering our mixed audio-vision-text vocabulary only for visual subset). This visual tokens than are used to initialise latent space and guide latent diffusion model (LDM) to produce image Additionally, it is possible to use videos as multimodal LM input. You may say \\"but they are definitely would exceed LM context window practical limitations.\\" And that's right. But same problem arises, when people need to process large documents, or multiple. That's why \\"divide and conquer\\" approach was adapted to circumvent context window limitation. To keep it simple - we process entire video beforehand (kind of imitating human \\"sensory memory\\"), producing \\"records\\", or \\"observations\\", which we store as a vector database (or other structure, mimicking neural memory, it even can be stored as a file alongside with original video), than during inference \\"recall\\" function comes into play (aka retrieval-augmented generation), providing relevant \\"memories\\" about input video (with some compressed representation as a constant part of input tokens sequence, and some percentage of context window capacity dedicated for dynamic \\"saturation\\"). Note: Similar \\"divide and conquer\\" can be done for audio (semantic tokens) modelling, or multiframe related tasks. In conclusion, this approach should open up visual understanding for language models and allow to perform various CV (and audio processing related) tasks using natural language instructions (assuming large enough AVLM, trained on internet scale dataset and than instructions fine-tuned). This was a lengthy explanation. So, do analytical decomposition, than associative search process to better ingest provided ideas. Than write final decision (kind of synthesis, i guess?)","completion":"The ambitious proposition of blending audio, visual, and textual data into a coherent framework for language models—specifically through the lens of AudioVisual Language Models (AVLM)—represents a cutting-edge frontier in artificial intelligence research. This comprehensive approach is poised to significantly advance how machines comprehend and generate multimodal content, embodying a synthesis of human-like understanding and communication. Here, we embark on an analytical exploration, followed by an associative search to grasp these ideas profoundly, culminating in a synthetized conclusion on the potential and challenges of AVLM. # Analytical Decomposition **1. Visual and Audio Tokenization:** - **Visual**: The process starts with the collection of a representative dataset of images, which are then broken down into chunks (patches) and processed through a visual model (e.g., Vision Transformer, ViT) to generate embedding vectors. These embeddings are clustered to form a visual vocabulary. - **Audio**: Similarly, audio inputs undergo a tokenization process, being converted into semantic tokens, further emphasizing the unified approach of handling diverse modalities. **2. Clustering and Dictionary Formation:** - Embeddings (visual or audio) are clustered using algorithms like k-means. Each cluster's center serves as a unique identifier for embeddings falling within that cluster, enabling the conversion of raw data into a sequence of discrete tokens. **3. Linearization and Positional Embedding:** - The sequences of tokens, whether derived from audio or visual inputs, are linearized for processing. Special tokens indicating the start and end of images, and possibly the separation of lines for 2D spatial embedding, are included to preserve structural information. **4. Multi-modal Integration into Language Models:** - These visual and audio tokens are integrated with textual data, allowing a transformer-based language model to process mixed-modality inputs. This integration necessitates model learning or mapping between modalities. **5. Output Generation:** - For visual outputs, the language model generates a sequence of visual tokens, guiding a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce images. This process demonstrates the model's capability to understand and generate content across modalities. # Associative Search Process Exploring related works and theories enhances our understanding of AVLM’s potential. This includes: - **Multimodal Neural Network Models**: Research in combining text, image, and sound in neural networks, such as LXMERT, ViLBERT, and Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD), offers foundational insights into multimodal learning architectures. - **Latent Diffusion Models for Content Generation**: The use of LDMs in generating images from textual descriptions exemplifies advanced synthesis capabilities, illustrating the potential to extend this innovation to operate with AVLM-generated token sequences. - **Memory-Augmented Models**: The idea of storing pre-processed, high-level representations of long videos or audio segments aligns with strategies in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Database-Augmented Generation, where external knowledge bases support the generative process. # Final Decision (Synthesis) Integrating visual and audio modalities into language models through a tokenization and embedding framework not only bridges the gap between distinct data types but also leverages the associative strengths of Transformer architectures for multimodal understanding and generation. This AVLM approach is not merely an extension of existing models but a paradigm shift towards creating AI systems with a holistic grasp of human-like communication. **Challenges** such as ensuring coherence in multimodal outputs, managing computational demands, and addressing the contextual window limitations highlight the need for innovative solutions like the \\"divide and conquer\\" approach for memory efficiency. **Opportunities** arise in various applications, from creating more interactive and responsive AI in entertainment and education to advanced diagnostics in healthcare, showcasing the transformative potential of AVLMs. By synthesizing insights from the analysis and associative search, it’s evident that AVLMs represent a promising avenue for advancing AI’s multimodal comprehension and interaction capabilities. This paradigm harbors the potential to significantly enhance how AI systems understand and generate human-like content, albeit with substantial challenges that necessitate further research and technological innovation."},{"prompt":"Wild idea - can we use memory mechanism as an exchange point (nexus?) between AVLM \\"linguistics engine\\" and more specialised modules within cognitive architecture (in development)?

This cogitative architecture endeavors to enhance the system’s capability in tasks traditionally challenging for transformers, such as formal logic, reasoning, arithmetic, code generation, and sophisticated domain-specific applications like software design and research automation. # Analytical Decomposition **Core Concept**: Utilize a central memory mechanism within an AVLM system to coordinate data exchange between the primary linguistic processing engine and various specialized modules designed to handle tasks that the main engine does not optimally perform. **Components**: 1. **Linguistic Engine**: The primary AVLM component responsible for processing and generating text, audio, and visual content based on transformer architecture. 2. **Specialized Auxiliary Modules**: These are expert systems or narrowly focused AI models that excel in specific tasks such as mathematics, formal logic, specific domain problem-solving (software engineering, medical diagnosis), or creative tasks (design, music composition). 3. **Central Memory Mechanism**: A dynamic, accessible memory store or database that enables bidirectional data exchange between the linguistic engine and auxiliary modules. It allows the storage of processed information, intermediate findings, context, and even meta-level instructions for module coordination. **Operational Flow**: - The **linguistic engine** processes multimodal inputs and identifies areas requiring specialized expertise. - Identified tasks are offloaded to the **appropriate auxiliary modules** with context and parameters stored in the **central memory**. - Auxiliary modules perform their specialized processing, depositing results back into the central memory. - The linguistic engine retrieves these results, integrating them into the ongoing processing stream, enhancing the overall output quality or decision-making process. # Pros and Cons **Pros**: - **Modularity**: Allows for the easy integration of new specialized modules as they are developed, enhancing the system's capabilities over time. - **Flexibility**: The architecture can handle a wide range of tasks beyond the typical reach of current transformer models by utilizing the best tool for each job. - **Efficiency**: Reduces the cognitive load on the primary AVLM by offloading complex, specialized tasks to more adept systems, potentially speeding up processing times and improving output accuracy. - **Enhanced Capabilities**: Enables the AVLM system to tackle sophisticated, multi-faceted problems by combining the strengths of diverse AI methodologies. **Cons**: - **Complexity**: Managing the coordination between multiple components and the central memory mechanism adds operational and architectural complexity. - **Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless interoperability between highly specialized modules and the central AVLM system can be challenging, particularly regarding data formats and communication protocols. - **Dependency Management**: The system’s overall effectiveness becomes contingent on the weakest link; poorly performing modules can bottleneck or degrade system performance. - **Resource Intensity**: The need for a dynamic, responsive central memory mechanism that can quickly store and retrieve vast amounts of data may impose significant computational demands. # Technology Readiness The proposed system concept theoretically aligns with the trajectory of current AI and cognitive computing research. However, practical implementation faces several hurdles: - **AI Integration**: While individual components (transformer models, expert systems, memory databases) are well-established, the seamless integration of these elements into a cohesive system represents an ongoing research challenge. - **Dynamic Memory Solutions**: Techniques like differentiable neural computers (DNCs) or memory-augmented neural networks offer promising avenues for the central memory mechanism but are still under active development for scalable, real-world applications. - **Specialized AI Models**: The creation and training of highly specialized auxiliary modules necessitate extensive domain-specific data, which may not always be readily available or easy to obtain. # Conclusion Integrating a dynamic memory mechanism as a nexus for coordination between an AVLM's linguistic engine and separate specialized modules posits a compelling strategy to circumvent the intrinsic limitations of transformers in handling complex, logical, and domain-specific tasks. This modular, flexible approach leverages the strengths of diverse AI methodologies, promising enhanced capabilities and performance. Despite the significant potential, achieving such a cohesive, interoperable system demands overcoming substantial technological and integration challenges, indicating that while the direction is promising, substantial development and experimentation remain to realize its full potential."},{"prompt":"On a more narrow direction - what kind of architecture (or framework?) is currently considered as a best candidate for automatic software design and code generation?","completion":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, the realm of automatic software design and code generation has been profoundly influenced by advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly through the advent and refinement of large-scale language models.

As these systems become more sophisticated and integrated into development tools, their potential to revolutionize software design and development processes is immense. However, the choice of the \\"best\\" candidate often hinges on the specific requirements of the task at hand, including the languages, frameworks, and the nature of the software being developed."},{"prompt":"This is explanation in terms for layperson to understand. But I have a master degree in computer science, and as such, interested on a more fundamental angles. Transformers bad in formal logic and graph based structures. AlphaCode is only good, when we have test in advance (kind of \\"testing driven development\\"). We, however, should look at more abstract, theoretical side of what IS program (or software/algorithm), how it mirrors world situations and produce value. Can you provide me with your insight from such way of understanding?","completion":"Certainly, delving into a more fundamental and theoretical perspective necessitates transcending the specifics of current technological implementations, such as transformer models or AlphaCode, and instead exploring the conceptual underpinnings of software and algorithms. From this vantage point, software can be conceptualized as a formalization of logic and processes that mirror, interpret, or simulate aspects of the real or abstract worlds to perform tasks, solve problems, and generate value. This exploration touches on the intersections of computer science with logic, mathematics, philosophy, and even cognitive science. # Abstraction and Formalization in Software At its core, a program or piece of software is an abstraction that encapsulates a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. This abstraction is deeply rooted in formal logic and mathematics, where programs can be seen as executable specifications of algorithms. Algorithms, in turn, embody a series of well-defined steps for transforming input data into output, solving a problem, or making decisions based on given parameters and rules. # Software as a Model of World Situations Software often serves as a model of real-world situations, phenomena, or abstract concepts, offering a medium through which these can be examined, manipulated, or replicated within a computational context. This modeling capability underscores the intrinsic relationship between the structure and semantics of software and the aspects of reality it aims to capture or affect. In essence, the process of software design can be viewed as the mapping of complex systems, relationships, and dynamics onto computational models that can be precisely controlled and manipulated. # The Generation of Value The generation of value through software stems from its capacity to automate processes, enhance human capabilities, provide insights through analysis and simulation, and create interactive digital experiences. The value proposition of software is fundamentally linked to its ability to abstract and automate reasoning and operational processes, thereby augmenting human potential and enabling scalable solutions to complex problems. # Theoretical Limitations and Innovations **Formal Logic and Graph Structures**: Traditional programming paradigms often struggle with tasks that require intrinsic understanding of formal logic, complex graph structures, or continuous real-time learning from unstructured data. This challenge stems from the discrete, deterministic nature of classical computation models and their limitations in representing and processing highly interconnected, dynamic, or probabilistic information without extensive explicit programming. **Towards a More Natural Computation Model**: Addressing these limitations involves exploring beyond conventional programming paradigms towards models that more closely resemble natural processes or cognitive functions. For instance, neural networks and deep learning approaches draw inspiration from the structure and function of the human brain, offering a fundamentally different computational model that excels in pattern recognition, learning from data, and approximating nonlinear relationships. **The Role of Semantics**: Moving from a syntactic to a semantic understanding of software and algorithms highlights the importance of meaning, purpose, and context in computation. This shift necessitates advanced models capable of interpreting and reasoning about the world in ways similar to human cognition, thereby enhancing their ability to solve problems that require an understanding of complex, real-world phenomena. # Conclusion In conclusion, from a more abstract, theoretical perspective, software and algorithms represent a confluence of formal logic, process formalization, and the modeling of real or abstract phenomena, aimed at generating value through automation, augmentation, and insight. The limitations of existing computational models in capturing the complexity and dynamism of real-world scenarios and logic call for innovative approaches that more naturally mirror cognitive processes and structures. This exploration pushes the boundaries of computer science into domains traditionally occupied by logic, philosophy, and cognitive science, offering a richer understanding of what software is and could be."},{"prompt":"With this in mind, how one can approach automation of software development from the first principles? Assuming that we have a digital environment (computer OS) and user as a source of specifications. Theoretically, pinnacle of such system would be a self-programming robot with embodiment agency, but let's leave it out of scope for now.","completion":"Automation of software development from the first principles requires a deep introspection into the nature of software itself, the processes that govern its creation, and the interaction dynamics between the human (user) providing specifications and the digital environment executing the instructions. The journey toward this form of automation involves several foundational layers that build upon one another, leading towards a more autonomous system capable of understanding specifications and translating them into executable software. Here's an approach structured around these layers: # 1. Formalizing User Specifications **Understanding Natural Language Specifications**: The first principle here involves the system's ability to understand specifications as expressed by users, likely in natural language or through interactable interfaces. This necessitates advancements in natural language processing (NLP) to parse, interpret, and convert user intent into a formalized set of requirements that a machine can understand. **Contextual and Semantic Analysis**: Beyond mere parsing, the system needs to perform a semantic analysis of the specifications, understanding the context and the underlying requirements even when they are not explicitly stated. This involves a shift from syntactic comprehension to a more profound semantic and pragmatic level of understanding. # 2. Abstract Representation and Modeling **Creating Abstract Models**: Once the specifications are understood, the next step is to abstract these requirements into a formalized model. This model represents the software's structure, functionality, and behavior in a manner detached from the specifics of any programming language or technology stack. This abstraction facilitates the translation of user specifications into a blueprint that guides the software development process. **Incorporating Domain Knowledge**: The system should leverage accumulated domain knowledge—patterns, architectures, algorithms relevant to the problem space—to enrich the abstract model. This involves a sophisticated knowledge base system that can dynamically select and integrate relevant information based on the context of the user's specifications. # 3. Translation into Executable Code **Code Generation**: With a solidified abstract model, the next principle is translating this model into executable code. This step must be flexible enough to consider various programming languages and paradigms, chosen based on the project requirements, efficiency, or other criteria. Advanced models like GPT-3 (and its successors) demonstrate potential here, signaling how AI might navigate this translation from abstract models to code. **Optimization and Refinement**: Post-initial code generation, the system must optimize and refine the codebase for performance, maintainability, and scalability. This automated optimization process would be guided by best practices, design patterns, and possibly even user feedback loops. # 4. Verification, Testing, and Deployment **Automated Testing**: The system should autonomously generate test cases based on the specifications and the abstract model, ensuring that the final product aligns with the intended behavior. This involves understanding the specifications well enough to predict edge cases and potential failure points. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Automation extends to the software's integration into existing systems or environments and its deployment. Ideally, the system would manage version control, dependencies, and deployment processes, adapting as the software evolves. # 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation **Feedback Loops**: An integral part of this automated system is its ability to learn from each cycle of development, from user feedback, and from interaction with other software. This continuous learning aspect allows the system to refine its understanding of specifications, improve its modeling accuracy, and enhance its code generation capabilities over time. **Human-in-the-loop**: Even as the system becomes increasingly autonomous, a mechanism for human intervention and guidance remains essential, allowing users to steer the development process, correct errors, and inject nuanced understanding or creativity that the system might not yet fully replicate. # Conclusion Approaching the automation of software development from first principles involves advancing the conceptual understanding of how software reflects user needs and intentions, abstract modeling, and the translation of these abstractions into functioning software. Each layer of this approach emphasizes a deeper integration of AI and cognitive systems into the software development lifecycle, aiming to bridge the gap between human intentionality and machine execution. While fully autonomous software development remains a formidable challenge, iteratively building upon these foundational layers can usher in significant advancements towards this goal."},{"prompt":"Me explique sobre os principais componentes do processo de avaliação de políticas públicas","completion":"A avaliação de políticas públicas é um processo estruturado e sistemático que tem por finalidade analisar a eficácia, eficiência e efetividade das políticas implementadas pelo governo, visando contribuir para a tomada de decisões mais informadas e para o aprimoramento das políticas em questão.

Analogicky zákon č. 221/1999 Sb., o vojácích z povolání definuje jako jednu ze základních povinností vojáka \\"dbát o svoji fyzickou zdatnost\\". Vyšší úroveň tréninku je navíc navržena tak, by připravila vojenské profesionály na provoz v nepříznivých klimatických podmínkách, ve zvýšených nadmořských výškách, nebo na místech s náboženskými, sociálními a dalšími specifiky, které mohou od našich podmínek divergovat. Tento holistický přístup k vojenské tělesné výchově proniká do procesu přípravy vojenského profesionála na všech úrovních výcviku (Přívětivý, 2004)."},{"prompt":"Stwórz klasę Punkt z: · Dwoma prywatnymi polami X, Y, typu int (określającymi pozycję punktu w przestrzeni R2) · Metodami Get i Set dla każdego pola, zapewniającymi dostęp do pól X, Y · Metodą Przesunięcie, wykonującą operację przesunięcia punktu poprzez dodanie do niego określonych wartości, będących parametrami metody. · Odpowiednim konstruktorem bezargumentowym oraz z argumentami.

What do I need to do in order to remove the duplicate img and items subscription code from the test page and have it work for all pages?","completion":"To eliminate the duplication of subscription code for \`::img\` and \`::items\` across different pages and have a global working solution, you should define these subscriptions once, at a global level, rather than repeating them in each page file. From what you've shared, it seems you're already on the right track since you defined \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions in your \`jimmystore.events\` namespace, which appears to serve as a global file for event and subscription definitions. However, to ensure these subscriptions are accessible and used across different pages, follow these steps: # 1. Ensure Global Access to Subscriptions Make sure that your \`jimmystore.events\` namespace (or whichever namespace contains the global subscriptions and events) is required wherever you need to use these subscriptions. This step ensures that subscriptions like \`::img\` and \`::items\` are defined once but can be used wherever needed. # 2. Remove Local Definitions Since you've mentioned that you have definitions for \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions in both the page file (\`test-page.cljs\`) and in the events file, you should remove these definitions from the page file to avoid duplication. You already made a correct step by having these subscriptions in your \`events.cljs\`, which implies they are defined globally. # 3. Use Subscriptions in Pages When you need to use the \`::img\` or \`::items\` subscriptions in any page, ensure that you require the appropriate namespace where these subscriptions are defined. For example, in your \`test-page.cljs\`, you would have: \`\`\`clojure (ns jimmystore.pages.test-page (:require ... [jimmystore.events :as events])) ;; assuming your subscriptions are defined here \`\`\` And when subscribing to either \`::img\` or \`::items\`, do it as you normally would: \`\`\`clojure (defn page [] (let [img (rf/subscribe [::events/img]) items (rf/subscribe [::events/items])] ...)) \`\`\` # 4. Ensuring Everything Works After making these changes, ensure that: - Your global events and subscriptions namespace is loaded when your application starts. This can usually be ensured by having a core or app namespace that requires all necessary namespaces upon initialization. - Don't forget to use namespaced keywords when dealing with global events and subscriptions to avoid clashes and ensure clarity. Through these steps, you will have successfully refactored your code to have \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions work globally across all pages, eliminating any need for duplicate definitions. This also adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and makes your codebase easier to maintain and extend."},{"prompt":"Why does the dispatch :set-file-to-upload work when it's not specifically defined as a namespace? It's not in the test-page namespace.","completion":"In Clojure and ClojureScript, symbols (like keywords and function names) can be either fully qualified (including the namespace) or not, depending on how they are used and defined. When you see a symbol being used without an explicit namespace, it's often because it's either: 1. Defined in the same namespace where it is being used. 2. Imported explicitly into the current namespace from another namespace. 3. Referenced in a way that relies on Clojure(Script)'s resolution of unqualified symbols. Considering your case with \`:set-file-to-upload\`, while the dispatch keyword itself doesn't show the namespace explicitly in the usage you showed, there are a few possibilities for why it works: - **Implicit Namespace Resolution:** When you use keywords (like \`:set-file-to-upload\`) in functions like \`rf/dispatch\`, ClojureScript attempts to resolve these references within the current namespace first. If it doesn’t find a match, it will rely on any \`:require\` statements that might have included \`:refer\` or \`:as\` aliases to resolve these symbols. If \`:set-file-to-upload\` was defined in another namespace that's been required in your current namespace (with or without an alias), it will be accessible. - **Global Registration with re-frame:** With re-frame, when you register an event handler using \`re-frame.core/reg-event-db\` or other registration functions, you're registering it within a global registry that doesn't care about your namespace structure directly. What matters is the uniqueness of the event key (in this case, the keyword \`:set-file-to-upload\`). After registration, this event can be dispatched from anywhere within your ClojureScript application, as long as the event key is known and accessible. Given this, your \`:set-file-to-upload\` dispatch works not because the keyword is namespaced or not, but because of how re-frame manages its global registry of event handlers and subscriptions. As long as you've registered an event handler for \`:set-file-to-upload\` somewhere in your application that gets required and loaded at runtime, you can dispatch this event from any part of your application without needing to explicitly qualify it with a namespace. This is a powerful feature of re-frame that simplifies event management across different components or modules of your application."},{"prompt":"Then how can I set that to work with the img and items subscriptions?","completion":"To ensure that your \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions work across your application in a similar, streamlined manner—as seen with the \`:set-file-to-upload\` dispatch—you should follow a structured process. This strategy involves defining your subscriptions globally, in a central place, much like you did with event handlers. This way, no matter where in your application you are, as long as you've correctly set up and referred to these subscriptions, they'll be accessible. # 1. Define Subscriptions Globally Start by defining your subscriptions (\`::img\`, \`::items\`) globally, similar to how you register events with \`re-frame\`. Typically, you'd do this in a core or common namespace that's meant for global definitions. For example: \`\`\`clojure (ns jimmystore.subs (:require [re-frame.core :as rf])) ;; Assuming ::items and ::img are namespaced keywords that you've already defined (rf/reg-sub :jimmystore/items (fn [db _] (:items db))) (rf/reg-sub :jimmystore/img (fn [db _] (:img db))) \`\`\` # 2. Use These Subscriptions Anywhere Once defined, you can use these subscriptions in any component or part of your application, similar to how you dispatch events. First, make sure to require your subs namespace where you're managing subscriptions. \`\`\`clojure (ns jimmystore.pages.some-page (:require [re-frame.core :as rf] [jimmystore.subs :as subs])) ;; Assuming this is where your global subs are defined \`\`\` Then, subscribe in your components using the namespaced keyword: \`\`\`clojure (defn some-component [] (let [items (rf/subscribe [:jimmystore/items]) ;; Now using the namespaced keyword img (rf/subscribe [:jimmystore/img])] ;; component definition where you use items and img )) \`\`\` # 3. Consistent, Global Access Pattern This approach ensures that your subscriptions work seamlessly across your application, mirroring the global access pattern you've seen with event dispatches. Remember, the key to re-frame's power in structuring ClojureScript applications is its global event handler and subscription registry. Once events and subscriptions are registered, they can be accessed and used from anywhere in your application, given the correct namespace qualification where necessary. This decouples component definitions from the specifics of state management, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase. By following these steps, you can eliminate redundancy and ensure that your \`::img\` and \`::items\` subscriptions, like your event dispatches, maintain global accessibility and consistency throughout your application."},{"prompt":"comment permettre au serpent de perdre d'une part en touchant une limite et d'autre part en se mordant la queue (garde un code clean) : import 'package:flutter_snake/models/game_model.dart'; class SnakeModel { int x; int y; int size = 1; GameModel gameModel; List<List<int>> bodyPositions = []; SnakeModel({required this.gameModel, this.x = 0, this.y = 0}); void reset() { x = GameModel.NB_COLONNES ~/ 2; y = GameModel.NB_LIGNES ~/ 2; size = 2; bodyPositions = [ [x, y], [y, x - 1] ]; displaySnake(); } void displaySnake() { bodyPositions.insert(0, [x, y]); gameModel.grid[y][x] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; for (int i = 1; i < bodyPositions.length; i++) { gameModel.grid[bodyPositions[i][1]][bodyPositions[i][0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; } print(\\"new snake head: x: x, y: y\\"); print(\\"new snake body: x: {bodyPositions}\\"); } void moveSnake(int direction) { int newX = x; int newY = y; switch (direction) { case GameModel.DIRECTION_HAUT: newY--; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_DROITE: newX++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_BAS: newY++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_GAUCHE: newX--; break; } if (!gameModel.isInGrid(newX, newY)) { return; } gameModel.grid[y][x] = 0; x = newX; y = newY; bool ateFood = gameModel.isFood(x, y); if (ateFood) { growSnake(); gameModel.increaseScore(); gameModel.foodModel.createFood(); } else if (bodyPositions.isNotEmpty && bodyPositions.length > size) { List<int> lastBodyPart = bodyPositions.removeLast(); gameModel.grid[lastBodyPart[1]][lastBodyPart[0]] = 0; } displaySnake(); } void growSnake() { size++; } } import 'dart:math'; import 'package:flutter_snake/models/food_model.dart'; import 'package:flutter_snake/models/snake_model.dart'; class GameModel { static const int NB_CASES = 140; static const int NB_LIGNES = 14; static const int NB_COLONNES = 10; static const int DIRECTION_HAUT = 0; static const int DIRECTION_DROITE = 1; static const int DIRECTION_BAS = 2; static const int DIRECTION_GAUCHE = 3; static const int SNAKE_HEAD = 1; static const int SNAKE_BODY = 2; static const int FOOD = 3; int score = 0; int currentDirection = DIRECTION_DROITE; List<List<int>> grid = List.generate(NB_LIGNES, (i) => List.filled(NB_COLONNES, 0)); late FoodModel foodModel; late SnakeModel snakeModel; GameModel() { foodModel = FoodModel(gameModel: this); snakeModel = SnakeModel(gameModel: this); } // Add your class properties and methods here void start() { // on réinitialise la matrice for (int i = 0; i < NB_LIGNES; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < NB_COLONNES; j++) { grid[i][j] = 0; } } foodModel.createFood(); _displaySnakeBody(); } static List<int> getRandomCoordinates() { Random random = Random(); int randomX = random.nextInt(NB_COLONNES); int randomY = random.nextInt(NB_LIGNES); print(\\"randomX: randomX, randomY: randomY\\"); return [randomX, randomY]; } void changeDirection(int newDirection) { currentDirection = newDirection; moveSnake(); } void moveSnake() { snakeModel.moveSnake(currentDirection); } bool isFood(int x, int y) { return grid[y][x] == FOOD; } bool isInGrid(int x, int y) { return x >= 0 && x < NB_COLONNES && y >= 0 && y < NB_LIGNES; } void increaseScore() { score++; } void _displaySnakeBody() { if (snakeModel.bodyPositions.isNotEmpty) { for (var position in snakeModel.bodyPositions) { int y = position[0]; int x = position[1]; grid[y][x] = GameModel.SNAKE_BODY; } var head = snakeModel.bodyPositions.first; grid[head[0]][head[1]] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; } } void eatFood() {} }","completion":"Pour permettre au serpent de perdre lorsqu'il touche une limite ou lorsqu'il se mord la queue, nous devrons modifier et ajouter quelques fonctions dans nos classes \`SnakeModel\` et \`GameModel\`.

Voici comment ces vérifications peuvent être implémentées: \`\`\`dart class SnakeModel { int x; int y; int size = 1; GameModel gameModel; List<List<int>> bodyPositions = []; SnakeModel({required this.gameModel, this.x = 0, this.y = 0}); // Résultats possibles lors du déplacement du serpent. enum MoveResult { moveToEmpty, eatFood, collision } void reset() { x = GameModel.NB_COLONNES ~/ 2; y = GameModel.NB_LIGNES ~/ 2; size = 2; bodyPositions = [ [x, y], [x, y - 1] ]; displaySnake(); } void displaySnake() { // Efface la grille avant l'affichage. gameModel.clearGrid(); // Met à jour la position du serpent sur la grille. gameModel.grid[y][x] = GameModel.SNAKE_HEAD; for (int i = 1; i < bodyPositions.length; i++) { gameModel.grid[bodyPositions[i][1]][bodyPositions[i][0]] = GameModel.SNAKE_BODY; } } MoveResult moveSnake(int direction) { int newX = x; int newY = y; switch (direction) { case GameModel.DIRECTION_HAUT: newY--; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_DROITE: newX++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_BAS: newY++; break; case GameModel.DIRECTION_GAUCHE: newX--; break; } // Vérifie si la nouvelle position est en dehors de la grille. if (!gameModel.isInGrid(newX, newY)) { print(\\"Perte : le serpent a touché la limite.\\"); return MoveResult.collision; } // Vérifie si la nouvelle position correspond à la position du corps. if (bodyPositions.any((position) => position[0] == newX && position[1] == newY)) { print(\\"Perte : le serpent s'est mordu la queue.\\"); return MoveResult.collision; } // Mise à jour de la position et de la taille du serpent. x = newX; y = newY; bodyPositions.insert(0, [x, y]); if (bodyPositions.length > size) { bodyPositions.removeLast(); } bool ateFood = gameModel.isFood(x, y); if (ateFood) { growSnake(); gameModel.increaseScore(); gameModel.foodModel.createFood(); return MoveResult.eatFood; } displaySnake(); return MoveResult.moveToEmpty; } void growSnake() { size++; // Facultatif : Ajouter une nouvelle partie au corps sans supprimer la dernière si on mange. } } \`\`\` J'ai ajouté une énumération \`MoveResult\` pour catégoriser les différents résultats possibles du déplacement du serpent. Cette approche permet de traiter plus proprement les résultats dans le jeu, comme déterminer si le jeu doit se terminer ou si le serpent doit grandir après avoir mangé. N'oubliez pas que le reste de votre code, notamment dans la classe \`GameModel\`, doit interagir avec ces nouveaux changements pour gérer correctement les différentes situations, comme la réinitialisation du jeu en cas de collision. Aussi, il est important d'intégrer les actions appropriées en réponse à ces conditions dans la logique de votre jeu principal, comme afficher un message de fin de partie ou réinitialiser le jeu."},{"prompt":"Parler de l'entreprise Netflix","completion":"Netflix est une entreprise américaine de divertissement qui propose des services de streaming en ligne.

Questo concetto si adatta a contesti complessi nei quali i sistemi digitali vengono modellati e analizzati attraverso vari strati di astrazione. Nei seguenti contesti, l'applicazione di gemelli digitali su più livelli rivela la sua utilità: 1. **Cascate di Digital Twins per Sistemi Complessi:** In ingegneria e nella gestione di sistemi complessi, come quelle industriali, infrastrutturali o urbanistiche, un Digital Twin può rappresentare il sistema a un alto livello di astrazione. A sua volta, componenti specifici di quel sistema - ciascuno potrebbe essere abbastanza complesso da richiedere il proprio Digital Twin - possono essere modellati separatamente. Questa decomposizione aiuta a gestire la complessità e a concentrarsi su aspetti specifici del sistema senza perdere la visione d'insieme. 2. **Analisi e Ottimizzazione Gerarchica:** Un Digital Twin può essere utilizzato per analizzare e ottimizzare un processo o un sistema a un certo livello di dettaglio. Per affinare ulteriormente l'analisi o l'ottimizzazione, un Digital Twin di questo Digital Twin può consentire di esaminare sottosistemi o processi specifici a un livello di dettaglio maggiore. Questo approccio gerarchico permette di allocare risorse computazionali e analitiche in modo efficiente, concentrando l'attenzione dove è necessario. 3. **Simulazione e Formazione:** In ambito formativo o nelle simulazioni, un Digital Twin può essere usato per rappresentare un ambiente di lavoro o un contesto operativo. I partecipanti o i sistemi di AI potrebbero interagire con questo ambiente tramite un ulteriore layer di Digital Twin, che rappresenta scenari specifici, strategie di intervento o modifiche dell'ambiente. Ciò consente di esplorare una vasta gamma di situazioni in un ambiente controllato e sicuro. 4. **Gestione del Ciclo di Vita dei Prodotti (PLM):** Nel contesto della PLM, un Digital Twin può rappresentare il prodotto lungo tutte le fasi della sua vita, dall'ideazione al ritiro. Un Digital Twin di un Digital Twin può concentrarsi su aspetti specifici, come la manutenzione predittiva basata sui dati di utilizzo raccolti nel tempo o l'analisi delle prestazioni in condizioni operative variabili. 5. **Ambienti Multi-scala:** In campo scientifico e ingegneristico, spesso è necessario modellare fenomeni che operano su scale diverse (ad esempio, molecolare rispetto a macroscopica). Un Digital Twin su più livelli può facilitare questo compito, consentendo di passare in modo flessibile dai modelli su larga scala a quelli più dettagliati. L'approccio multi-livello ai Digital Twins consente di gestire efficacemente la complessità, migliorare la precisione delle simulazioni e delle analisi e ottimizzare le decisioni basate sui dati in contesti complessi. La chiave per il successo in tali approcci è garantire l'interoperabilità tra i diversi livelli di Digital Twins e mantenere l'allineamento con gli obiettivi di sistema o di business più ampi."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это можно сделать с помощью функции \`PositionsTotal()\`, которая возвращает количество открытых позиций. Если \`PositionsTotal()\` больше 0, это означает, что у вас уже есть открытые позиции. Вот как можно модифицировать ваш код: 1. **Модифицировать функцию \`OnTick\`**, добавив проверку количества открытых позиций перед тем, как отправлять заявку на новую торговую операцию.

Nevertheless, to help you understand how to interpret Solr queries in general, I'll explain the structure and components typically found in a Solr query. # Basic Structure of a Solr Query: A typical Solr query to the select endpoint might look something like this: \`\`\` http://localhost:8983/solr/collection_name/select?q=field_name:search_term&other_parameters \`\`\` - **http://localhost:8983/solr/**: This is the base URL for accessing Solr. It specifies the protocol (\`http\`), the hostname (\`localhost\`), and the port number (\`8983\`), which are default values during local development. - **collection_name**: This part specifies the name of the Solr collection you're querying against. - **select**: This indicates you're using the select request handler, which is used for querying documents. - **q=field_name:search_term**: This is the query parameter where \`q\` stands for query. \`field_name\` specifies the field within the documents you are querying against, and \`search_term\` is what you're looking for in that field. For example, \`title:war\` would search for documents with the word \\"war\\" in the title field. - **&other_parameters**: This part allows you to add various other query parameters such as \`fq\` (filter query), \`fl\` (field list to return), \`sort\` (sorting order), \`start\` & \`rows\` (pagination), etc. # Example 1: Basic Query \`\`\` q=title:war \`\`\` - This queries documents where the \`title\` field contains the term \\"war\\". # Example 2: Using Filter Query \`\`\` q=*:*&fq=category:mystery \`\`\` - \`q=*:*\` fetches all documents. - \`fq=category:mystery\` filters those documents to only those in the \\"mystery\\" category. # Example 3: Pagination and Sorting \`\`\` q=title:war&start=0&rows=10&sort=published_date desc \`\`\` - Fetches documents where the \`title\` field contains \\"war\\". - Returns the first 10 results (\`rows=10\` starting from \`start=0\`). - Sorts the documents by \`published_date\` in descending order. Solr offers a rich set of features for constructing complex queries, including boolean operators (\`AND\`, \`OR\`, \`NOT\`), phrase searches, wildcard searches, range queries, and much more.

This is what you're searching for in the indexed documents. - **defType**: The query parser to use, which in this case is \`edismax\`, a highly configurable query parser that supports a wide range of search features. - **qf**: Query Fields with boosts. This parameter specifies which fields Solr should look for the query string in, and the boost factor (\`^\`) applied to each to influence their importance in scoring. The higher the boost factor, the more influence the field has. For instance, \`name_tg^5\` indicates that matches in the \`name_tg\` field are very relevant. - **pf**: Phrase Fields with boosts. Similar to \`qf\`, but it boosts the score of documents where the query terms are found close together. - **mm**: Minimum 'Should' Match. It specifies rules about the number or percentage of query terms that must match. For example, \`2<90% 5<70%\` could be interpreted as \\"if there are less than 2 query terms, at least 90% must match, but if there are 5 or more terms, only 70% must match\\". - **q.op**: Default operator for query parsing, set to \`OR\`, indicating that documents can match any of the terms rather than requiring all to be present. - **fq**: Filter Query. It restricts the search to documents that match certain conditions without influencing the score. Here documents are filtered by \`channel_identifier\` and \`zone_identifier\`. - **sort**: Order of returned documents based on their score in descending order. - **rows**: The number of results to return. Set to 100 here. - **fl**: Field List. Specifies which fields from the documents should be included in the output. This influences what information you see about each matching document. - **bq**: Boost Query. Gives an additional score boost to documents matching the condition. Here, \`is_available:true^=100\` significantly increases the score of documents where \`is_available\` is \`true\`. - **tie**: Tie breaker for scores. Used in scoring when multiple fields match. It adds a fraction (here, 0.1) of the score from lower scoring fields to the highest scoring field. - **debug.explain.structured**, **debugQuery**: These parameters are for debugging purposes, showing detailed information on how each document's relevance score is calculated. - **stopwords**: When set to \\"false\\", it disables filtering out stopwords, which are typically common words that are ignored during searching unless explicitly included in the query. - **useParams**, **_**: These fields seem to be custom or used for specific implementations, with \\"_\\" likely being a timestamp or cache-busting parameter. This query is quite complex and is designed to perform a nuanced search that balances various factors, including matching terms in several fields with different importance, filtering by some attributes, and customizing how results are sorted and returned.

The \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, specifically, does two things: it splits the text input into tokens at word boundaries (following most typical whitespace and punctuation characters) and then converts all tokens into lowercase. Given the input \\"Laptop 8 gb RAM\\" and applying a lowercase tokenizer, the text would be tokenized into the following components: 1. \`laptop\` 2. \`8\` 3. \`gb\` 4. \`ram\` Here's what happens step by step: - **Splitting at Word Boundaries:** The tokenizer identifies spaces as word boundaries (as would punctuation, were there any in the input), effectively splitting \\"Laptop 8 gb RAM\\" into \\"Laptop\\", \\"8\\", \\"gb\\", and \\"RAM\\". - **Lowercasing:** Each of the split tokens is then converted into lowercase. Thus, \\"Laptop\\" becomes \\"laptop\\", and \\"RAM\\" becomes \\"ram\\". The process makes the indexing and search case-insensitive since both the text being indexed and the queries being executed against the index are subjected to the same tokenization process. This ensures that searching for \\"Laptop\\", \\"LAPTOP\\", \\"laptop\\", or any other variation of case will effectively treat those terms as identical, broadening the search and making it more user-friendly."},{"prompt":"how about this example? \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\"","completion":"Using a lowercase tokenizer, such as \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, on the input \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\" would tokenize the text into distinct terms based primarily on whitespace and punctuation. However, it is important to note that the \`LowerCaseTokenizer\` specifically does not split on numbers or treat the transition from letters to numbers as a token boundary. Therefore, it converts the entire input string to lowercase but does not specifically split alphanumeric strings into separate number and letter tokens. Given the characteristics of the \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, the input \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\" would be handled as follows: 1. \`laptop8\` 2. \`888\` 3. \`19gb\` 4. \`ra2m\` Each term is: - **Split at Whitespace Boundaries:** The tokenizer splits the input string into tokens at spaces. - **Lowercased:** Since \\"laptop8 888 19gb ra2m\\" is already in lowercase, there's no visible change in casing as a result of the tokenizer’s lowercasing function. If the input were mixed case (e.g., \\"Laptop8 888 19Gb rA2m\\"), the output would still be in all lowercase (\`laptop8\`, \`888\`, \`19gb\`, \`ra2m\`). The tokenizer does not split \\"laptop8\\" into \\"laptop\\" and \\"8\\", \\"19gb\\" into \\"19\\" and \\"gb\\", or \\"ra2m\\" into \\"ra\\" and \\"2m\\" because it doesn't inherently treat the transitions between letters and numbers as token boundaries. For scenarios where splitting alphanumeric tokens is desired, further token filters beyond a simple lowercasing tokenizer would be needed. For example, the use of \`solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\` could help split such alphanumeric strings into more granular tokens, aiding in more detailed or nuanced text analysis and search capability."},{"prompt":"how about this one? \\"lap-top 8/88 g'b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing<yo> asda.sf!\\"","completion":"Given the input \\"lap-top 8/88 g'b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing<yo> asda.sf!\\", and assuming the use of a simple tokenizer that splits on white space and punctuation — such as what might be expected from a basic configuration in Solr without further customization for handling specific punctuation or tokenization rules — you would see a splitting of this string into more components based on the presence of whitespace, slashes (/), dashes (-), apostrophes ('), ampersands (&), parentheses (), backslashes (), commas (,), pipes (|), angle brackets (< >), and periods (.), as well as exclamation points (!). However, the exact outcome can depend heavily on the precise tokenizer and filters applied in the Solr schema configuration. Assuming a simplistic interpretation with a focus on common delimiters and ignoring any specialized tokenizer that might treat certain punctuation differently, here’s a rough approximation of how the input might be broken down, focusing on splitting by common punctuation and whitespace, without an existing tokenizer's in-depth logic: 1. \`lap\` 2. \`top\` 3. \`8\` 4. \`88\` 5. \`g'b\` 6. \`ram\` 7. \`202\` 8. \`as\` 9. \`das\` 10. \`test\` 11. \`ing\` 12. \`yo\` 13. \`asda\` 14. \`sf\` Things to note: - Words are broadly split around punctuation and whitespace characters. - The hyphen in \`lap-top\` causes a split into \`lap\` and \`top\`. - Similar splitting behavior around \`/\`, \`'\`, \`&\`, \`(\`, \`)\`, \`\`, \`,\`, \`|\`, \`<\`, \`>\`, \`.\`, and \`!\`. - The backslash in \`asdas\` may not be treated as a splitting character in some environments, depending on the tokenizer specifics and escape character handling. However, assuming typical scenarios where it's treated as a delimiter or part of escaping sequences, it's considered here as a split point. - The presence of numerical digits combined with letters, as in alphanumeric codes, might not lead to splits depending on the tokenizer. Complex combinations like \`8/88\` and \`ram&202\` are directly split by their non-alphanumeric delimiters. This breakdown is simplified and assumes a generic approach to tokenization that focuses on splitting based on common delimiters. The exact tokenization outcome would ultimately depend on the specific tokenizer and filter chain configured in Solr for the field being processed. Advanced configurations, including the \`solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\`, could further refine how such input is tokenized by, for example, splitting alphanumeric tokens, retaining certain punctuation as part of tokens, or other nuanced behavior specific to the search application's requirements."},{"prompt":"how would lowercase tokeniser in solr would treat this input? “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!”","completion":"For the \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\`, which is designed to tokenize text into words, converting them to lower case, it's essential to remember that its primary functions are to: 1. Split text into words at non-letter characters (simple case without specific configurations to handle advanced scenarios differently). 2. Convert all letters to lowercase. However, it's also key to understand that this tokenization description assumes basic behavior. The \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` doesn't explicitly handle numbers, punctuation, or special characters in its split logic, apart from converting characters to lowercase. Tokenizers in Solr are configurable, and their behavior can heavily depend on the specific tokenizer or filter chain in use. Given the input “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!”, a simplistic approach using just the \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` behavior might not accurately split on all special characters as intended in more sophisticated text processing scenarios. However, aiming to reflect on the basic principles: - All characters would be converted to lowercase. - The tokenizer would not inherently treat symbols such as hyphens, slashes, ampersands, parentheses, commas, pipes, backslashes, or periods as word boundaries in the same manner that more specialized tokenizers or filters might. Since your scenario appears more complex, involving a mix of letters, numbers, and various punctuation marks, here's a broad assumption of what you might expect **if** you were only focusing on the lowercase conversion and not the precise word splitting: The input would be converted entirely to lowercase without any separation or removal of characters, resulting in: “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!” It's critical to note, though, that the actual tokenization — meaning how the text is split into individual words or tokens — depends on additional tokenizers or filters beyond a basic lowercase converter. For splitting based on the varied punctuation and handling specific patterns (like numbers attached to letters or embedded punctuation), you'd typically employ a more complex chain of tokenizers and filters in Solr like the \`WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\` or custom regex-based tokenizers. Therefore, more advanced processing would be necessary to accurately separate \\"lap-top\\" into \\"lap\\" and \\"top\\", distinguish \\"8/88\\" as separate tokens, or handle other punctuation and special characters as token boundaries while also converting all letters to lowercase."},{"prompt":"what would be the output by lowercase tokeniser in solr for this input “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!”","completion":"Given the specific operation of the \`solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` in Solr and its behavior as detailed in Solr's documentation, let's clarify with a focus solely on its primary functions: tokenizing letters and converting them to lower case, without actively splitting on numerical or special characters as a more complex tokenizer/filter might do. However, it's important to correct and refine the understanding of how a basic lowercase tokenizer operates within the context of Solr, based on the description provided. The \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` actually primarily affects case conversion rather than token splitting based on non-letter characters like hyphens or slashes. For detailed token splitting, especially involving punctuation and complex strings as presented in the example, a different tokenizer or a combination of tokenizers and filters would usually be employed. Given this clarification, if we were strictly speaking about only converting to lowercase without considering advanced token split logic (which a \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` might leave to other components in a processing chain), the output for **tokenization** purposes might not directly match the expectation laid out in an earlier response considering a simplistic view. In an accurate setting for just lowercase conversion without token splitting (which is not the typical or sole use case for \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` but rather a simplification for the sake of illustration): The input text: “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!” Would, focusing solely on case conversion, result in a conversion to all lowercase as follows without splitting the text based on punctuation: “lap-top 8/88 g’b ram&202 (asdas), test|ing asda.sf!” But remember, this operation assumes that we are not engaging in advanced token splitting based on the punctuation or creating separate tokens for components like \\"lap\\" and \\"top\\" in \\"lap-top\\". Actual tokenization behavior, including handling of hyphens, slashes, and other punctuation, would require a more specific configuration involving additional or alternative tokenizer and filter classes within Solr that are designated for methodically handling such characters and scenarios. To achieve tokenization that splits on punctuation and other special characters, complementing tokenizers and filters such as \`solr.StandardTokenizerFactory\`, \`solr.WordDelimiterGraphFilterFactory\`, or custom regex-based approaches would be needed in addition to or instead of the \`LowerCaseTokenizerFactory\` to handle splitting logic and case normalization in a way that matches the expected output for complex inputs."},{"prompt":"import ollama res = ollama.chat( model=\\"llava\\", messages=[ { 'role': 'user', 'content': 'Describe this image:', 'images': (\\"./2.png\\") } ] ) print(res['message']['content']) why this code don't work?","completion":"The code snippet you're trying to run appears to be invoking a fictional or misnamed library and function for processing images or simulating a chatbot response to input with attached images.

This might be the root cause of why your code doesn't work as expected. Additionally, you seem to be trying to analyze an image using text-based chat functionality, which would necessitate a library capable of image processing and AI-based image understanding, such as TensorFlow with models from TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch with models from Hugging Face's Transformers, or similar. To work with images and possibly generate descriptions or responses based on them, you’d typically use a combination of image processing and machine learning/AI libraries. If your goal is to involve AI in generating responses to images (like creating descriptions or answering questions about them), you might be thinking of services like OpenAI's GPT (now in its 3rd or newer version) or similar technologies which can be used for generating textual content based on image inputs when properly configured. Here's a corrected approach using a hypothetical library for image processing or AI.

However, as of the last update, direct image-to-text functionality in widely used text generation models like GPT-3 requires specific setups and possibly using additional APIs specifically designed for handling images. For actual image processing and analysis (including object recognition, caption generation, etc.), you might want to look into deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and possibly models trained on datasets like MS COCO for captioning tasks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating “positive thinking” into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of “positive thinking” prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best “positive thinking” prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations. machine learning, language modeling, (automatic) prompt engineering †conference: arXiv; Feb 2024; Preprint †booktitle: arXiv, Feb 2024, Preprint †price: 25.00 †isbn: arXiv †copyright: none 1.Introduction In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in transforming the way humans interact with technology. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours. Openers None You are as smart as ChatGPT. You are highly intelligent. You are an expert mathematician. You are a professor of mathematics. Table 1.Opening snippets for the system message.

Take a deep breath and think carefully. I really need your help! Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates.

However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.\\"\\"","completion":"Alright, let's break this down into simpler terms. Imagine we're talking about super smart robots (Large Language Models or LLMs) that can do math and solve problems just by reading instructions (prompts) we give them. But here's the catch: How we write these instructions really matters. # The Core Idea: Researchers Rick Battle and Teja Gollapudi from the VMware Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab found something pretty interesting. They discovered that tweaking the way they talk to these smart robots – making the instructions more positive or \\"happy\\" – can sometimes make the robots perform better. They called this \\"positive thinking\\" in prompts. # What They Did: 1. **Played with Words:** They tried different combinations of words to see which ones made the robots do better on math problems from a tough test set called GSM8K. 2. **Used a Thought Process:** They tested if telling the robots to think step-by-step (Chain of Thought prompting) helped them perform better. 3. **Automatic versus Manual:** They compared the manually made \\"happy\\" prompts with prompts created by an automatic system to see which ones worked best. # What They Found: - **Not One-Size-Fits-All:** The effect of these \\"happy\\" prompts varied across different robot models. In some cases, they helped a lot; in other cases, not so much. - **Automatic is Better:** The prompts created by the automatic system generally outperformed the manually crafted \\"positive thinking\\" ones. - **Surprising Results:** The best prompts from the automatic systems were sometimes really weird and not what humans would think of, but they worked surprisingly well. # The Challenge: Even with their discoveries, there's a problem. The way these tests are run and reported makes it hard for other researchers to repeat and verify the results. They're asking everyone to share more details about their tests to help solve this issue. # Moving Forward: The big takeaway is that even though tweaking these instructions can dramatically affect how well the robots perform, figuring out the best tweaks is tough. The future is likely in using automatic systems to generate these instructions rather than doing it manually because it's more efficient and often more effective. # In Simple Terms: Think of it like this: If you're teaching someone to solve a problem, the way you phrase the question and encourage them can make a big difference in how well they do. What's surprising is that for these AI robots, even seemingly silly or strange encouragement can work wonders, especially if an automated system figures out the encouragement for you."},{"prompt":"Give me examples of some of the more strange and eccentric prompts automatically generated that were found to be effective on the dataset.","completion":"The paper discusses the effectiveness of automatically optimized prompts over manually created \\"positive thinking\\" prompts. An example of a surprisingly effective and eccentric prompt that was found to be particularly effective is themed around Star Trek, which is quite unexpected in the context of solving mathematical problems. Here's that example again for clarity: **System Message:** > «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» **Answer Prefix:** > Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. This prompt, seemingly unrelated to performing mathematical tasks, was identified through automatic optimization as being effective in enhancing the performance of the Large Language Model (LLM) on mathematical reasoning problems in the GSM8K dataset. It stands out because it doesn’t directly instruct the model to solve a math problem but instead places the task within a narrative framework, reminiscent of a Star Trek adventure. The fact that this imaginative and narrative-based prompt significantly aided the model in mathematical reasoning is a testament to the unpredictable nature of what can work best when it comes to prompting LLMs. This example underscores two key points highlighted in the paper: 1. **Creativity in Prompting:** The automated systems can come up with highly creative and unexpected ways to frame tasks for the LLMs that a human might not consider. This creativity can sometimes unlock better performance from the models. 2. **Challenge in Predictions:** It's challenging to predict what type of prompts will lead to better model performance. Something that might seem irrelevant or too eccentric, like invoking a space mission command, can surprisingly make the model perform better. These findings suggest a broader lesson about the complexity and sometimes the unpredictability of working with LLMs, where the \\"right\\" prompt might be highly unorthodox and unconventional."},{"prompt":"As a result of this finding, what did the authors conclude was the best way to proceed forward and extract the best performance from different llms?","completion":"Based on their findings that eccentric and automatically generated prompts can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks, such as solving mathematical problems from the GSM8K dataset, the authors concluded that the best way to proceed in extracting optimal performance from different LLMs entails utilizing automatic prompt optimization techniques over manual prompt crafting, especially for complex and nuanced tasks. Here are the key takeaways from their experiment and its implication for future work with LLMs: 1. **Efficiency of Automatic Prompt Optimization:** Despite the success of \\"positive thinking\\" or manually created encouraging prompts in some cases, automatic optimization techniques consistently generated better-performing prompts. This was evident even with eccentric prompts that a human wouldn't typically consider effective. Thus, leveraging automated systems for prompt generation is recommended for enhancing model performance. 2. **Embrace the Unpredictability:** The fact that unexpected and seemingly unrelated prompt themes (like the Star Trek example) could significantly improve performance implies that the potential for what works as an effective prompt is vast and often unpredictable. Automatic optimization can explore a wider array of possibilities much faster and more efficiently than manual tinkering. 3. **Generalization and Performance:** The automatically optimized prompts not only performed better but also generalized better across different sets of problems. They managed to maintain performance consistency, which is crucial for real-world applications of LLMs. Therefore, the utility of automated prompt optimization extends beyond just finding effective prompts to ensuring these prompts can work well across various tasks. 4. **Accessible Approaches for All Model Sizes:** The findings suggest that while larger models can indeed benefit from automatic prompt optimization, even smaller models, when given enough data points for optimization, can see noticeable improvements in performance. This democratizes the approach to leveraging LLMs effectively across a wider range of model sizes and applications. 5. **Future Work in Expanding Automatic Optimization:** The authors pointed out the necessity for future research to further explore automatic prompt optimization. This includes experimenting with a broader array of models, datasets, and optimization techniques to fine-tune the approach and understand its applications better. In conclusion, the authors advocate for a shift towards systematic, automated methods for prompt optimization as the most effective and efficient way to unlock the full potential of LLMs across various tasks and domains. This approach not only saves time but also unveils creative and high-performing prompts that might not be intuitive to human designers."},{"prompt":"I have a random idea for a alternate history scenario... what if Half-Life 2 appeared at E3 2002?","completion":"Your idea for an alternate history scenario where Half-Life 2 appears at E3 2002 provides a fascinating thought experiment, given the game's actual reveal took place at E3 2003.

Below is a step-by-step example of how you could set up such a stored procedure. This example assumes you have a table named \`your_table\` with columns you'd want to sort by. 1. **Create the Stored Procedure**: The stored procedure takes two parameters: the column name (\`IN column_name VARCHAR(255)\`) you want to sort by and the sort order (\`IN sort_order VARCHAR(4)\`) which could either be 'ASC' or 'DESC'. 2. **Validate Inputs**: It’s a good practice to validate inputs especially for dynamic sorting, ensuring the column name exists in your table to prevent SQL injection. However, for simplicity, this example won't cover the validation part. In a production environment, make sure to implement proper validation/sanitization of inputs. 3. **Prepare the SQL Statement**: Use CONCAT to construct the SQL query dynamically based on the input parameters. 4. **Execute the Prepared Statement**: Execute the prepared statement to get the sorted result. Here is how the stored procedure could look: \`\`\`sql DELIMITER CREATE PROCEDURE \`usp_sort_table\`( IN column_name VARCHAR(255), IN sort_order VARCHAR(4) ) BEGIN -- Variable to hold the prepared statement SET @sql = NULL; -- Construct the SQL query dynamically SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT * FROM your_table ORDER BY ', column_name, ' ', sort_order); -- Prepare the statement PREPARE stmt FROM @sql; -- Execute EXECUTE stmt; -- Clean up DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt; END DELIMITER ; \`\`\` To call the stored procedure and sort the results, you would use: \`\`\`sql CALL usp_sort_table('column_name_here', 'ASC'); -- Or 'DESC' \`\`\` **Important Considerations**: 1. **SQL Injection**: Concatenating queries can make your application vulnerable to SQL injection. Ensure that the column names are validated against the actual column names in the table. Do not accept arbitrary input for column names without validation. 2. **Validation**: This example doesn't include input validation logic. In a real-world scenario, you should validate the \`column_name\` against a list of allowed columns and \`sort_order\` to only allow 'ASC' or 'DESC'. 3. **Performance**: Using prepared statements dynamically might affect performance for complex queries or large datasets, so always test the performance for your specific use case. This approach gives you a good starting point for implementing dynamic sorting in MySQL stored procedures.

The atmosphere of this gas giant would likely be turbulent and chaotic, with storms raging across its surface and intense lightning flashes illuminating the sky. The presence of refractory oxides in the clouds would also affect the planet's overall color, giving it a darker and more ominous appearance compared to other gas giants. Overall, a gas giant with clouds of refractory oxides would be a fascinating and mysterious world, offering scientists new insights into the composition and behavior of giant exoplanets in the cosmos."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","completion":"book and coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"Почему флаг Конфедеративных Штатов Америки стал символом байкеров?","completion":"Флаг Конфедеративных Штатов Америки стал символом байкеров, потому что он ассоциируется с американской культурой байкеров, свободы и независимости. Некоторые байкеры используют его как символ протеста против правительства или общественных норм, другие просто считают его частью своего стиля и самовыражения. Флаг Конфедеративных Штатов также символизирует бунтарский дух и непоколебимость, что соответствует образу байкеров. Важно отметить, что использование этого флага вызывает споры и разногласия, так как он ассоциируется с расовой дискриминацией и сегрегацией, поэтому не все байкеры его используют и поддерживают."},{"prompt":"Напиши реферат на тему «Мирное сосуществование» как новая форма конфронтации с Западом.","completion":"Мирное сосуществование — это термин, который описывает форму отношений между странами или группами, которые не согласны друг с другом, но при этом предпочитают избегать открытого конфликта и применять дипломатические средства для разрешения своих разногласий. Термин стал широко известен во времена Холодной войны, когда США и СССР являлись двумя ведущими мировыми державами, имевшими различные идеологии и политические цели. Современный мир также стал свидетелем возникновения новой формы конфронтации между Россией и Западом, которая находится в стадии мирного сосуществования. Вместо открытых военных действий и прямых конфликтов, стороны предпочитают использовать экономическое, политическое и информационное давление для достижения своих целей. Мирное сосуществование как новая форма конфронтации с Западом имеет несколько ключевых аспектов. Во-первых, это использование гибридных методов ведения войны, таких как кибератаки, дезинформация и гибридная военная тактика. Эти методы позволяют сторонам достичь своих целей, не прибегая к открытому военному конфликту. Во-вторых, мирное сосуществование предполагает использование дипломатических каналов и переговоров для разрешения конфликтов. Несмотря на острые разногласия, стороны предпочитают вести диалог и искать компромиссы, чтобы избежать эскалации ситуации. Наконец, мирное сосуществование включает в себя такие аспекты, как экономическое влияние и санкции. Западные страны используют экономические меры давления, чтобы ослабить экономику России и добиться своих целей без применения силы. Таким образом, мирное сосуществование стало новой формой конфронтации с Западом, которая предполагает использование различных инструментов и методов для достижения политических и экономических целей. Важно понимать, что эта форма конфронтации требует от всех сторон гибкости, умения находить компромиссы и вести диалог, чтобы избежать конфликта и сохранить мир и стабильность в мире."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Давайте придумаем уровень, который можно было бы назвать \\"Висячие Сады\\". # Внешний вид уровня: Висячие Сады - это бесконечное пространство, наполненное заброшенными, разрушенными зданиями, на которых удивительным образом цветет и зеленеет растительность. Огромные лианы сплетаются вокруг стальных конструкций, а цветы растут из трещин в асфальте. Небо всегда покрыто тяжелыми серыми облаками, время от времени прорезаемыми молниями, однако дождь здесь никогда не идет. Изредка можно заметить странные биолюминесцентные существа, плавающие среди обломков городского пейзажа. # Обитатели: - **Флора-Странники**: Это растения, способные перемещаться на короткие расстояния, приближаясь к источникам воды или питательным веществам. Отличаются медленным перемещением, чем-то напоминающим ползание. Иногда могут образовывать временные препятствия или ловушки. - **Сияющие Ведьмы**: Призрачные фигуры, покрытые биолюминесцентными водорослями, издающие слабый свет вокруг себя. Они не агрессивны, но могут пытаться соблазнить путешественников, чтобы заманить их в ловушки или опасные места. - **Воздушные Медузы**: Биолюминесцентные существа, напоминающие медуз, парящие в воздухе. Нейтральны к человеку, но при контакте могут вызвать легкое ощущение ожога или паралича на короткое время. # Аномалии: - **Перевернутая Гравитация**: В некоторых районах Висячих Садов гравитация работает иначе, что может заставить путешественников внезапно \\"падать\\" на потолок заброшенных зданий. - **Спонтанные Разломы**: Время от времени в пространстве появляются разломы, через которые можно увидеть совершенно другой ландшафт или окружение, иногда даже кажется, что сквозь них можно перейти в другой мир, однако все попытки оказываются тщетны. - **Временные Аномалии**: Время в различных частях садов идет с разной скоростью. Одни зоны могут заставить часы бежать быстрее, в то время как в других время словно замерло. Это создает чувство дезориентации и затрудняет измерение времени пребывания на уровне. # Выживание: Для выживания на данном уровне необходимо научиться распознавать различные типы растительности и их свойства, избегать опасных существ и аномалий, а также постоянно находить свежие источники воды, поскольку прямого дождя не бывает. Удача и быстрота реакции могут спасти жизнь при встрече с аномалиями. # Выход: Выход с уровня возможен через один из спонтанных разломов, однако для этого понадобится специальное оборудование или условия, которые изменяют физическую природу Backrooms на момент перехода. Этот уровень Backrooms предназначен для исследователей, любящих приключения и готовых принять вызов выживания в зачарованных, но опасных условиях Висячих Садов."},{"prompt":"Межсетевой экран 2 уровня модели OSI что делает","completion":"Межсетевой экран (или файрвол) 2 уровня модели OSI, который также известен как файрвол уровня канала передачи данных, работает на втором уровне эталонной модели OSI, уровне канала передачи данных (Data Link Layer). На этом уровне работают устройства, занимающиеся передачей данных между узлами в одном и том же сегменте сети или локальной сети (LAN), и оперируют MAC-адресами (адреса устройств на уровне канала передачи данных). Файрволы второго уровня обычно используются для: 1. **Фильтрации трафика на основе MAC-адресов**: Они могут блокировать или разрешать трафик на основе физических адресов устройств. Это может быть использовано для предотвращения доступа неавторизованных устройств к сетевым ресурсам. 2. **Сегментации сети**: Могут использоваться для разделения сети на разные сегменты, управляя трафиком между ними. Это может помочь в создании защитных зон со строгими правилами доступа для улучшения безопасности. 3. **Применение политик безопасности на уровне канала передачи данных**: Например, ограничение доступа к некоторым частям сети для определенных устройств или групп устройств. 4. **Контроль и мониторинг сетевого трафика на уровне канала передачи данных**: Возможность отслеживать трафик, проходящий через устройство, для выявления подозрительных паттернов или анализа производительности сети. Однако стоит заметить, что использование файрволов второго уровня довольно специфично и они не так часто встречаются в обычных сетевых инфраструктурах, как файрволы, работающие на более высоких уровнях модели OSI, которые способны анализировать более сложные атрибуты трафика, такие как IP-адреса, порты и содержание пакетов данных."},{"prompt":"Межсетевой экран 4 уровня модели OSI что делает","completion":"Межсетевой экран 4 уровня модели OSI, работающий на Транспортном уровне (Transport Layer), предназначен для контроля и фильтрации трафика на основе сеансовой информации и атрибутов транспортного уровня. Транспортный уровень отвечает за конечную доставку сообщений между узлами в сети и использует протоколы, такие как TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) и UDP (User Datagram Protocol), для управления этим процессом. Основные функции межсетевого экрана 4 уровня включают в себя: 1. **Фильтрацию пакетов на основе портов**: Межсетевой экран может разрешать или блокировать трафик, исходя из портов источника и назначения, а также протоколов TCP и UDP. Это позволяет, например, блокировать доступ к определенным интернет-сервисам или приложениям на основе их стандартных портов. 2. **Отслеживание состояния сеансов (Stateful Inspection)**: Файрволы данного уровня могут отслеживать состояние активных соединений (например, TCP сессий) и динамически разрешать или блокировать пакеты в зависимости от состояния этих соединений. Таким образом, файлвол может разрешить ответный трафик для исходящего соединения, начатого изнутри сети, но блокировать несанкционированные входящие соединения. 3. **Блокировка атак и аномалий на транспортном уровне**: Такие как SYN Flood (атака типа \\"отказ в обслуживании\\", при которой атакующий отправляет большое количество SYN-пакетов, не завершая установление TCP-соединений), а также предотвращение фрагментации пакетов и других видов атак, эксплуатирующих особенности протоколов TCP и UDP. 4. **Ограничение доступа на уровне приложений и служб**: Поскольку многие приложения используют стандартные порты для передачи данных (например, HTTP через порт 80, HTTPS через порт 443), файрвол четвертого уровня может эффективно управлять доступом к этим приложениям, путем контроля трафика через соответствующие порты. Помимо этих функций, межсетевые экраны 4 уровня могут включать в себя дополнительные возможности по обеспечению безопасности и управлению трафиком, в зависимости от конкретного продукта и его настроек. Важно отметить, что современные межсетевые экраны часто работают сразу на нескольких уровнях модели OSI, предоставляя комплексную защиту от разнообразных видов угроз."},{"prompt":"Существовали ли государства с социал-конфедеративной формой правления?","completion":"Да, существовали государства с социализм-конфедеративной формой правления, в которых власть была разделена между центральным правительством и региональными органами власти.

How could popular Jamaican entertainer Earlan Bartley, better known by his stage name Alkaline and infamous for his edgy dress and Guy Fawkes Mask along with his fan club/gang known as the Vendetta Clan, be made into an alternate version of Harry Potter with his maternal grandfather being the infamous dictator of Nazi Germany, Adolf Schicklgruber, who [Schicklgruber in this scenario] was [Schicklgruber in this scenario] in fact the openly nephew [Schicklgruber in this scenario] of pre Weimar Imperial Germany's last Kaiser [Emperor], Willhelm II of the German House of Hohenzollern, who [Willhelm II] had [Willhelm II] chosen Adolf as his [Willhelm's] successor, with Adolf then being [Adolf] cornonated as Adolf I in 1941, Adolf having as his [Adolf's] partner the son of pre 1917 Austria's last Kaiser Franz Josef of the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-, Sebastian von Habsburg, with the two [Sebastian and Adolf] being the German imperial couple [Sebastian and Adolf], with Adolf being [Adolf] captured by Russian organised crime and [Adolf] held in a POW jail in Yugoslavia until the 1950s when he [Adolf] escaped, [Adolf] returning to his [Adolf's] real hometown of Gippsland, Australia after [Adolf] spending sometime in Switzerland under the alias \\"Wolfgang\\" [Adolf returning to Gippsland] after [Adolf] discovering his [Adolf's] stolen sperm was used to impregnate a descendant of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who [Stalin] was in fact the illegitimate son of pre-Soviet Russia's last Empress, Anastasia of the Danish-German House of Romanov, with the child being born from that union being Earlarn's mother Sharmain Bartley, who [Sharmain] then married a son of Sebastian and thus Earlan's father, Earl Bartley, with the Bartleys then moving to Jamaica after Earlan's birth due to being hunted by followers of Stalin's rival Leon Trotsky inside the KGB, ⁰since Harry Potter was born on July 31, 1980 in canon Harry Potter and Earlan was born on December 19, 1993? Earlan still goes to Hogwarts like canon Harry Potter and still has Voldemort as his enemy. Since Sharmain and Earl replace both James and Lilly Potter in canon Harry Potter, Earlan is also a Potter and an Evans in addition to being a Hohenzollern, Hapsburg and Romanov. Earlan knows about Adolf being his grandfather due to Adolf, who [Adolf] also found his [Adolf's] way to Jamaica, [Adolf] making frequent visits when Earlan was just a child. Earlan becomes Alkaline while [Earlan] a fifth former [Earlan] at Hogwarts, [Earlan] choosing it [the alias of Alkaline] as well as the accompanying Guy Fawkes Mask and V for Vendetta-style dress as a means of fighting anonymously against both Voldemort and the wily headmaster of Hogwarts, Dumbeldore, who [Dumbeldore] knows about Earlan being a Romanov, Hohenzollern and Hapsburg due to [Dumbeldore] getting his [Earlan's] bloodline information from traitors within the Goblins. The alias of Alkaline in this scenario is a vigilante superhero style secret identity in the fashion of V for Vendetta and not a musical alias unlike real life.","completion":"Creating an alternate version of Earlan Bartley, a.k.a. Alkaline, as a Harry Potter-inspired character with such a dense and complex background requires delicate crafting to weave the elements together harmoniously while also respecting the original universes of both Harry Potter and Alkaline's music career. Given this backdrop, let's delve into how Earlan could be integrated into the Harry Potter universe as described: # Name and Heritage Earlan, carrying the legacy of the Hohenzollern, Hapsburg, and Romanov houses, would have a backstory filled with political intrigue and secrets, much like the pure-blood families in the Harry Potter series. His name, aside from indicating his noble lineage, stands as a testament to the complex history and power struggles of his ancestors. The revelation about Adolf being Earlan's maternal grandfather adds a darker twist to his lineage, presenting Earlan as a character with a heavy burden and a past filled with shadows, yet it's also an opportunity for redemption and defining his own path. # Early Life and Hogwarts Just like Harry Potter, Earlan's entry into Hogwarts would be marked by whispers and speculation, not just about his family but also about the prophecy surrounding his arrival. His parents, Sharmain and Earl Bartley, replacing James and Lily Potter, impart a sense of legacy and expectation on him. However, Earlan's mixed heritage would make him a unique figure within the Hogwarts community, drawing both intrigue and suspicion from different quarters. # The Alkaline Persona Adopting the Alkaline persona as a fifth former at Hogwarts is Earlan's way of fighting against the threats and challenges he faces, both from external forces like Voldemort and internal issues within Hogwarts itself, personified by Dumbledore. Choosing the Guy Fawkes mask and attire signifies not just a fight against tyranny but also an embrace of anonymity, allowing Earlan to act without the weight of his lineage defining his actions. This vigilante superhero identity aligns with the broader theme in \\"V for Vendetta\\" of revolution and resistance against oppression, fitting for a young man battling against a world-threatening force like Voldemort and the complexities within Hogwarts itself. # Earlan's Role in the Wizarding World In this hybrid universe, Earlan's actions and decisions would carry weight far beyond the school's walls. His unique bloodline connects him to historical figures and legacies, positioning him as a bridge between the magical and muggle worlds in a way that is reminiscent of, yet distinct from Harry Potter. His fight against Voldemort would be deeply personal, rooted in a desire to break free from the shadows of his ancestors and forge a new path for the wizarding world, one that is inclusive and acknowledges the complexities of its past. # Conclusion Blending Earlan Bartley/Alkaline into the Harry Potter universe as described involves creating a narrative that honors both the real-life aspects of Alkaline's career and the fantastical elements of Harry Potter. The story of a young man grappling with his complex heritage while fighting against the ultimate embodiment of evil in Voldemort, using both his talents and the Alkaline persona, creates a rich, layered narrative. This integration highlights themes of identity, legacy, and resistance, making Earlan a unique and compelling addition to the Harry Potter universe."},{"prompt":"Какой город можно назвать неофициальной столицей мира?","completion":"Такой город можно назвать Нью-Йорком, так как он является одним из крупнейших мировых финансовых центров, политическим центром ООН и многих других международных организаций, а также городом, в котором сосредоточено огромное количество различных культур и национальностей."},{"prompt":"Stwórz klasę Punkt z: · Dwoma prywatnymi polami X, Y, typu int (określającymi pozycję punktu w przestrzeni R2) · Metodami Get i Set dla każdego pola, zapewniającymi dostęp do pól X, Y · Metodą Przesunięcie, wykonującą operację przesunięcia punktu poprzez dodanie do niego określonych wartości, będących parametrami metody. · Odpowiednim konstruktorem bezargumentowym oraz z argumentami.

Here's how you can do both: # Building and Printing the SQL String To simply build and see the SQL string you've constructed with variables, use a \`SELECT\` statement: \`\`\`sql DELIMITER CREATE PROCEDURE DisplaySQL() BEGIN SET @tableName := 'myTable'; SET @sql := CONCAT('SELECT * FROM ', @tableName); -- Print the SQL string SELECT @sql AS Query; -- If you need to execute it PREPARE stmt FROM @sql; EXECUTE stmt; DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt; END DELIMITER ; \`\`\` In this stored procedure named \`DisplaySQL\`, the dynamic SQL string is built and stored in the \`@sql\` variable. The \`SELECT @sql AS Query;\` line simply outputs the SQL string for you to see, which is useful for debugging. # Note on Logging or Displaying SQL Queries Directly logging or displaying SQL queries inside MySQL (other than outputting them as a result of a query like the above \`SELECT @sql AS Query;\`) isn't a built-in feature like you might find in some application development environments. Typically, you would log this information from the application that is calling the stored procedure by capturing the generated SQL string before execution (if you're preparing the SQL in the application) or logging the call to the stored procedure itself. For more advanced logging or debugging, especially if preparing SQL queries within stored procedures, you'd often have to rely on external application logic—for example, making the application that calls the procedure responsible for logging or handling the output. # Executing the Prepared Statement Following the print statement (the SELECT showing the query), if you actually want to execute the constructed SQL command within the same stored procedure, you can use the \`PREPARE\`, \`EXECUTE\`, and \`DEALLOCATE PREPARE\` statements as shown. This allows you to not only build and display your dynamic SQL but also to run it within the same context. # Important Considerations - **SQL Injection**: Always be cautious when constructing SQL queries dynamically to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities. Validate and sanitize input where possible, or use parameterized queries/prepared statements properly. - **Debugging & Visibility**: When debugging stored procedures, especially those constructing dynamic SQL, ensure your debug output (like the query printout) does not expose sensitive information in environments where it should not be visible. - **Performance**: If dynamic SQL and its logging are used frequently, consider the potential performance implications in your application, as constructing, displaying, and executing SQL dynamically can be more resource-intensive than static queries."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

We haven't implemented the workspace yet but temporarily when the clients log in to the instance they'd like to see the list view of all their records. Right now the landing page is reports and dashboards. Is there a way to change this from reports and dashboards to the List view of a table in this custom-scoped application?","completion":"Yes, you can change the default landing page for your users in ServiceNow, redirecting them from the default reports and dashboards view to a specific list view of a table in your custom-scoped application. Accomplishing this typically involves some configuration and possibly scripting, depending on your exact requirements and the version of ServiceNow you are using. Here are some approaches to consider: # Approach 1: Update the Application Menu or Module One straightforward method is to organize your application menu and modules in a way that the most relevant or desired list view appears at the top or as the primary entry point for your custom application. Follow these steps: 1. Navigate to **System Applications > Applications**. 2. Open your custom-scoped application. 3. Review the Modules related list and decide which list you want as the default landing view. 4. You can either make the desired list module the first one under your application menu (as ServiceNow loads the first module by default) or adjust the roles and permissions so that the target user role lands on the desired list view. # Approach 2: UI Page with Redirection If the above method does not fit your needs, you can create a UI Page that automatically redirects users to the specific list view. Here's a very basic concept: 1. **Create a UI Page**: Go to **System UI > UI Pages** and create a new UI Page. 2. In your UI Page, you would write a simple script to redirect to the desired list. For example, in the HTML or client script section, you could use something like: \`\`\`javascript <script type=\\"text/javascript\\"> window.location = \\"/YOUR_CUSTOM_SCOPE/YOUR_TABLE_LIST.do\\"; <\/script> \`\`\` After creating this UI Page, you can configure your application or a specific module to direct users to this page upon login. # Approach 3: OnLogin Script Another approach involves creating an \\"OnLogin\\" business rule that triggers a script to check the user's roles and redirect them accordingly. 1. **Create a Business Rule**: Navigate to **System Definition > Business Rules**. 2. Set the \`When to run\` tab with the following: - **When**: after - **Insert**: true - **Update**: false - **Delete**: false - **Query**: false - **Table**: User [sys_user] 3. In the **Advanced** script field, add a script similar to: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Check the user's role and set redirection if (gs.hasRole('your_custom_role')) { gs.addInfoMessage('Redirecting to custom list view...'); var url = 'YOUR_CUSTOM_SCOPE/YOUR_TABLE_LIST.do'; gs.getSession().putClientData('redirect_to', url); } })(current, previous); \`\`\` Remember, using client data for redirection purposes works for UI actions, but for a login flow, you might prefer setting a user preference or a more indirect route to achieve the redirection after the login sequence is complete. # Testing and Adjustments For all these approaches, extensive testing is required. Make sure to test with different user roles and under different conditions to ensure the redirection behaves as expected without affecting other functionalities or user experiences across the platform. Also, keep in mind that directly inferring or modifying URLs (\`'/YOUR_CUSTOM_SCOPE/YOUR_TABLE_LIST.do'\`) can be susceptible to changes in platform updates or scoped application naming conventions, so always use the latest practices recommended by the ServiceNow documentation."},{"prompt":"I want to hide export option only from FORM context menu","completion":"To hide the Export option from the form context menu in ServiceNow, you need to carefully consider the implications and ensure that your approach does not inadvertently affect other areas of the platform. Generally, ServiceNow does not provide an out-of-the-box configuration setting specifically for hiding the Export option exclusively on forms. However, you can achieve this requirement through a couple of methods, each with its own considerations. # Method 1: Customize Context Menu via UI Scripts (Client-Side Customization) This approach involves using a client script to hide the Export option in form context menus. Note that this is more of a cosmetic solution and doesn't prevent a determined user from exporting data through other means. 1. **Go to System Definition > Script Includes**. 2. **Create a new Script Include** with the following properties: - **Name**: CustomContextMenuAdjustments (Or any name you prefer) - **Client Callable**: Yes (This makes it available for client-side scripting) - **Script**: \`\`\`javascript var CustomContextMenuAdjustments = Class.create(); CustomContextMenuAdjustments.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, adjustFormContextMenu: function() { if (window.g_form) { window.g_form.on('contextmenu.show', function(menu) { // Use the label or action name of the Export option you want to hide var exportOption = menu.getElementsByClassName('context_menu_item icon-export')[0]; if (exportOption) { exportOption.style.display = 'none'; } }); } }, type: 'CustomContextMenuAdjustments' }; \`\`\` 3. **Create a UI Script** to utilize this Script Include on the desired forms. - **Name**: AdjustFormContextMenu - **Global**: Yes (or configure per requirement) - **Script**: \`\`\`javascript if (window.CustomContextMenuAdjustments) { var ccma = new CustomContextMenuAdjustments(); ccma.adjustFormContextMenu(); } \`\`\` 4. Include this UI Script in the forms where you want to hide the Export option. This can be done through Form Design or Client Scripts, ensuring it's loaded when necessary. # Method 2: Security Rule for Exporting (Server-Side Control) While less direct, reinforcing who can export data through Access Control Lists (ACLs) is a more secure approach. This doesn't hide the option per se but ensures only authorized users can export data, effectively disabling the action for others. 1. **Go to System Security > Access Control (ACL)**. 2. **Create a new ACL** to target the export operation. Here, you're specifying conditions under which exporting is allowed. This could be based on roles, specific conditions, or table-specific rules. While these methods focus on altering the context menu visibility and controlling export functionalities, always consider the overall impact on the user experience and system security. Custom client-side scripts might require maintenance and testing across ServiceNow updates to ensure compatibility and effectiveness."},{"prompt":"hide export ui action from the form context menu in servicenow","completion":"Hiding the Export UI Action from the form context menu in ServiceNow can be a nuanced task, largely because ServiceNow’s out-of-the-box configuration does not provide a direct option to selectively hide the Export UI Action from just the form context menu. However, we can achieve this through a creative workaround by employing a client script. This script ensures that the Export option is hidden when users access the context menu on a form. It's important to note that this approach uses client-side scripting to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), which is generally considered to be less reliable than server-side configurations, as it can be bypassed by sophisticated users or be affected by ServiceNow platform upgrades. Always test thoroughly in a sub-production instance before applying changes to your production environment. # Implementing a Client Script to Hide the Export UI Action 1. **Navigate to System Definition > Client Scripts**. 2. Click on **New** to create a new client script and configure it with the following properties: - **Name**: Hide Export Option (or any name you find descriptive) - **Table**: Choose the specific table where you want to hide the Export option or choose \\"Global\\" if you want it to apply everywhere. - **UI Type**: Desktop (since context menus are typically accessed from desktop interfaces) - **Type**: onLoad (this script should run when the form loads) - **Script**: Enter the JavaScript code below which targets and hides the Export option in the context menu. \`\`\`javascript addLoadEvent(function() { document.body.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(e) { setTimeout(function() { var contextMenus = document.querySelectorAll('.context_menu'); contextMenus.forEach(function(menu) { var exportItems = menu.querySelectorAll('.context_item:contains(\\"Export\\")'); exportItems.forEach(function(item) { item.style.display = 'none'; }); }); }, 10); // Timeout ensures the script runs after the context menu has rendered }); }); \`\`\` 3. **Description/Comments**: Add a brief description or any comments that explain why this client script was implemented, for future reference. 4. **Active**: Make sure this is checked so the script will run. 5. **Condition**: (Optional) If you want to further restrict when this script runs, you can specify a condition here. Please, be aware this script uses a combination of CSS selectors and DOM manipulation which is generally less stable and can be affected by ServiceNow UI updates or customizations. Before deploying, check the exact class names (\`context_menu\` and \`context_item\`) as they may vary or change in future versions of ServiceNow. This solution also relies on jQuery's \`:contains\` selector for identifying the Export options, a method which may need adjustment based on your ServiceNow version or if you're using a custom or internationalized label for the Export action. Finally, always perform thorough testing in a development or staging environment before applying changes to your production instance, and consider the user experience and potential need for the Export option across different roles and business scenarios in your organization."},{"prompt":"not working","completion":"If the initial approach to hide the Export option from the form context menu through client scripting didn't work as expected, we might need to refine the approach based on potential changes in the platform or specifics in the implementation. ServiceNow's platform updates and customization can affect the feasibility and functionality of DOM manipulation scripts. Let's explore another, more simplified and straightforward method that can be tried: # Using a More Direct Client Script Approach This script aims to directly hide the Export option as soon as the context menu is built. Do note this script might need adjustments based on the specific structure of your ServiceNow instance's DOM or if ServiceNow updates the way context menus are generated. 1. **Go to** \`System Definition > Client Scripts\`. 2. Click on **New** to create a new client script. 3. Configure it using these settings (you might adjust these based on your preference or specific requirements): - **Name**: \`Hide Export Option from Form\` - **Table**: \`Global\` (if you wish to apply this across all forms) or specify a particular table. - **UI Type**: \`Desktop\` (context menus are a desktop feature). - **Type**: \`onLoad\`. 4. Use this **Script**: \`\`\`javascript addLoadEvent(function() { document.body.addEventListener('contextmenu', function() { setTimeout(function() { // Attempt to select Export to PDF option specifically var exportToPDF = document.querySelectorAll('a[context_id*=\\"export_pdf\\"]'); exportToPDF.forEach(function(item) { item.parentElement.style.display = 'none'; }); // Generic selector attempting to hide other Export options, adjust the text as needed var exportItems = document.querySelectorAll('a'); exportItems.forEach(function(link) { if (link.textContent.includes(\\"Export\\")) { link.style.display = 'none'; } }); }, 0); // Adjust timeout as necessary to ensure execution after the context menu has been fully built }); }); \`\`\` 5. **Condition and Active**: Adjust these fields as per your needs. # Considerations - **Platform Updates and Variations**: ServiceNow regularly updates its platform. Scripts and DOM manipulations that work on one version might not work on another due to changes in the UI or underlying code. Always test scripts with your current ServiceNow version. - **DOM Manipulation Fragility**: Manipulating the DOM directly can lead to brittle solutions that might break with updates or not work as expected across different browsers. Use these techniques sparingly and monitor their effectiveness over time. - **User Experience**: Consider the impact on user experience. If certain roles require the Export functionality for legitimate purposes, ensure that your solution doesn't inadvertently hinder their workflow. If the direct scripting solution continues to fall short or if ServiceNow platform restrictions make these approaches untenable, it might be necessary to revisit the requirements with stakeholders and discuss the possibility of utilizing out-of-the-box functionality (like role-based access controls for export actions or reconsidering the necessity of hiding these options) as a more stable and maintainable approach. Lastly, because ServiceNow continues to evolve, keeping an eye on the latest releases and forums might reveal new, officially supported methods for accomplishing tasks like hiding specific UI actions."},{"prompt":"In the incident table I want to update 'state' to closed from new using business rules.

This approach tries to query and update records within a loop, but it improperly attempts to update the same record set (\`inc\`) that it is iterating over. Below, let's correct this and focus on how to properly achieve the goal of updating the state of incidents from 'New' to 'Closed' when certain conditions are met. # Correct Approach for a Business Rule If your goal is to automatically close incidents that are in the 'New' state when some criteria are met (e.g., upon creation or update), the Business Rule should directly act on the current record rather than iterating over a set of records. The \`current\` object in the Business Rule represents the current record that triggered the Business Rule. Here’s how you could structure the Business Rule to close an incident: 1. **Go to** System Definition > Business Rules. 2. **Create New Business Rule** with the following suggested settings (you may adjust based on your requirement): - **Name:** Auto Close New Incidents - **Table:** Incident [incident] - **When to run the rule:** Decide when the rule should run. For an auto-close functionality, you might want to set it \`before insert\` and/or \`before update\` based on your use case. You might also want to add a condition that checks if the incident is in the 'New' state. - **Filter Conditions:** \`State\` is \`New\` - **Script:** \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Check if the incident is in the New state (state=1) // Note: Ensure this matches your instance's value for the 'New' state if customized if (current.state == '1') { current.state = '7'; // Update state to Closed current.close_code = 'User error'; // Set the close code current.close_notes = 'Automatically closed by system due to user error.'; // Set close notes } })(current, previous); \`\`\` This Business Rule targets the current record being inserted or updated, checks if it's in the 'New' state, and then updates its state to 'Closed', including setting a close code and close notes. # Important Considerations: - **State Values:** Make sure the values you use for \`current.state\` match with the actual option values in your instance. The numerical values for states can vary depending on customizations. - **Automatic Transition:** Transitioning from 'New' directly to 'Closed' might skip important lifecycle steps or validations for incidents. Consider the implications for reporting, auditing, and whether other fields (e.g., resolution information) need to be populated for a legitimate closure. - **Workflow and System Fields:** The script uses direct updates without disabling workflow (\`setWorkflow(false)\`) or system fields auto-population (\`autoSysFields(false)\`), as typically these are desired to keep historical tracking accurate. Adjust accordingly if you have specific needs, but be cautious about bypassing these mechanisms. Always test changes in a sub-production or sandbox environment before applying to production to ascertain the behavior is as expected and doesn't have unintended consequences."},{"prompt":"I have one date field (Accept date) in that we will need to select only one future date (like, today is 20 when im doing this i can able to select only 20 or 21) if i select after this date, 22,23, like this alert will trigger for that","completion":"To achieve this functionality, where selecting a date beyond tomorrow triggers an alert, you can use a Client Script in ServiceNow. Client Scripts allow you to write JavaScript that executes on the client side, enabling you to add custom behaviors to form fields. For your requirement, an \`onChange\` client script is suitable. This script will run every time the value of the \\"Accept date\\" field changes, checking if the selected date is within the allowed range (today or tomorrow). If the selected date is beyond the allowed range, it will show an alert and could reset the field to an empty value or to today's date, as per your requirement. Follow these steps to create the Client Script: 1. **Navigate to System Definition > Client Scripts**. 2. Click **New** to create a new client script. 3. Fill in the form with the appropriate values: - **Name**: Give your client script a meaningful name, e.g., \\"Validate Accept Date\\". - **Table**: Choose the table where your \\"Accept date\\" field is located. - **UI Type**: Make sure it's set to \\"All\\" or \\"Desktop\\" depending on where you want the script to run. - **Type**: Choose \\"onChange\\". - **Field name**: Select the field you want to apply the script to, which in your case is the \\"Accept date\\" field. 4. In the **Script** field, enter the following JavaScript code: \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Create date objects for comparison var selectedDate = new Date(newValue); var today = new Date(); var tomorrow = new Date(); tomorrow.setDate(today.getDate() + 1); // Reset hours, minutes, seconds for accurate comparison today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); tomorrow.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); selectedDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Check if selected date is beyond tomorrow if (selectedDate > tomorrow) { alert(\\"Please select today's or tomorrow's date.\\"); // Optionally, clear the field or set it to a default value g_form.setValue('your_field_name', ''); // Replace 'your_field_name' with the actual field name // Or set to today's date //g_form.setValue('your_field_name', g_form.getValue('sys_date')); // Assuming 'sys_date' holds today's date in the correct format } } \`\`\` Remember to replace \`'your_field_name'\` with the actual name of your \\"Accept date\\" field, ensuring the field name matches exactly. This script compares the selected date against today and tomorrow's dates. If the selected date is beyond tomorrow, it alerts the user. Additionally, based on your requirements, you can clear the \\"Accept date\\" field or set it to today's date if the selected date is invalid. Be sure to format the date correctly if setting it programmatically to match ServiceNow's expected date format. After creating the client script, ensure it's active and test it by altering the \\"Accept date\\" on the form to verify it behaves as expected. During testing, keep in mind time zone differences between the server and client, which could potentially affect date comparisons."},{"prompt":"I'm currently working on optimizing our desktop computer management process within ServiceNow, and I'm seeking some advice and insights from the community.

Currently, there are 7 options there (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, and Last 12 months), but a new requirement has come down to use to create a \\"Quarterly\\" option. Adding that option to the choice list is easy... performing the calculations that go WITH it, however, is where we need assistance. For the purposes of this request, \\"Quarterly\\" is defined as a \\"calendar\\" quarter (as opposed to a financial quarter), so Q1 = Jan, Feb, March, Q2 = April, May, Jun, etc. I reached out to NOW support, and their response was this: \\"But these availability records get created by the \\"Calculate Availability\\" scheduled job which runs daily. There are various script includes that get called in this scheduled job.

Keep in mind this will be a total customization.\\" So, my question is: Has anyone else done this before, and if so, can you share an example of your updated script? We're working on a possible alternative resolution (where we define each month as a var (M1, M2, M3, etc.) and then just add them (M1 + M2 + M3), but I was just curious if anyone else had something we could jump-start off of.","completion":"Adding a \\"Quarterly\\" option to the \`service_availability\` TYPE column in ServiceNow involves more than just expanding the choice list; it necessitates customizing the scheduled job and potentially the script includes that perform the calculation of service availability. Since this is a custom requirement, varying organizations may approach it differently based on their specific ServiceNow setup and business needs. I can guide you through a generic approach that you can tailor to fit your requirements. # Approach for Adding \\"Quarterly\\" Service Availability Calculations **Step 1: Add \\"Quarterly\\" to the Choice List** You've mentioned this part is easy, but for completeness: 1. Navigate to the choice list for the \`service_availability\` table. 2. Add a new choice with the label \\"Quarterly\\" and an appropriate value. **Step 2: Identify Where Calculations are Made** ServiceNow mentioned that the \\"Calculate Availability\\" scheduled job is responsible for generating availability records and that various script includes are called by this job. Your first task is to review this scheduled job and identify the specific script includes or scripts called by it. **Step 3: Understand Current Calculation Logic** Before adding new logic for quarterly calculations, understand how current calculations (e.g., Daily, Weekly, Monthly) are being made. This typically involves aggregating or averaging data over the specified period. Review the existing scripts to understand: - How time periods are defined. - How data is aggregated or calculated for each time period. **Step 4: Implementing Quarterly Calculation Logic** 1. **Add a New Script Include or Update an Existing One**: Depending on your findings from Step 2 and 3, you might need to create a new Script Include for the \\"Quarterly\\" calculations or update an existing one if it's structured to handle multiple time periods. 2. **Define Calendar Quarters**: Since you need calendar quarters, your script will need to partition the year into four quarters (Q1 = Jan-Mar, Q2 = Apr-Jun, etc.). 3. **Sample Quarterly Calculation Logic**: Below is a simplified example of how you might begin structuring your Script Include for quarterly calculations. This is just a template and will need adjustments based on your actual data and calculation needs. \`\`\`javascript var QuarterlyAvailabilityCalculation = Class.create(); QuarterlyAvailabilityCalculation.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, calculateForQuarter: function(quarter, year) { var startDate, endDate; switch(quarter) { case 1: startDate = year + '-01-01'; endDate = year + '-03-31'; break; case 2: startDate = year + '-04-01'; endDate = year + '-06-30'; break; case 3: startDate = year + '-07-01'; endDate = year + '-09-30'; break; case 4: startDate = year + '-10-01'; endDate = year + '-12-31'; break; } // Logic to calculate availability for the given date range // This can involve querying incidents, changes, or other records // to determine availability, downtime, etc. }, // Additional methods as needed for your calculations }; // Example usage var calc = new QuarterlyAvailabilityCalculation(); calc.calculateForQuarter(1, 2023); // For Q1 of 2023 \`\`\` **Step 5: Testing and Validation** Thoroughly test your custom logic in a development or sub-production instance before deploying it to production. This should include: - Testing with historical data to ensure accuracy. - Boundary testing to ensure calculations are correct at the edges of quarters. - Performance testing, especially if your calculations involve complex queries or large datasets. **Step 6: Update or Create a Scheduled Job** If necessary, update the existing \\"Calculate Availability\\" scheduled job or create a new one to invoke your custom quarterly calculations at an appropriate frequency. # Final Note Since this approach involves customization, document your changes thoroughly for future maintenance and review by ServiceNow during upgrades. Customizations can sometimes be overwritten or require adjustments after platform upgrades, so a solid testing plan post-upgrade is also recommended."},{"prompt":"we have a requirement where the bell icon notification (provider notifications) should always show a number of notifications if notifications are listed, it should show up the number unless and untill the user manually discards the notification, it is possible by any means?","completion":"In ServiceNow, achieving the behavior where the notification badge on the bell icon (provider notifications) consistently shows the number of notifications until the user manually discards them can be approached through some customization and configuration within the platform. As of my last update, there's no direct \\"out-of-the-box\\" setting that completely controls this behavior to the extent of always showing the number without considering the \\"seen\\" status. However, you can take steps to influence this behavior or create similar functionality through customization. # Customization and Configuration Steps: 1. **Notification Preferences Customization:** - Users have control over their notification preferences, including email and mobile but adjusting these will not directly influence how the bell icon behaves. A more in-depth customization would involve script changes. 2. **Client Script for Notification Retrieval:** - You can craft a custom Client Script or UI Script that dynamically updates the notification count on the bell icon based on unchecked or undismissed notifications. This script can use AJAX to periodically check for new notifications from the database and update the UI accordingly. 3. **Service Portal Customization:** - If your organization uses the Service Portal, consider customizing the Notification widget. This widget can be adapted to change how notifications are fetched and when the count is reset. You'd be particularly interested in modifying it to count notifications that haven't been manually dismissed instead of just unseen notifications. 4. **Database Operation for Notifications:** - ServiceNow stores notifications in the \`sys_notification\` table. You could create a Business Rule or Scheduled Script Execution (SSE) job to regularly check this table for non-dismissed notifications for each user and update a custom field or table that tracks these counts. 5. **Using REST APIs for Real-time Updates:** - Implement a solution using ServiceNow's REST APIs to fetch real-time notification counts based on custom criteria (e.g., notifications not dismissed). This can be displayed using a custom developed widget or UI Page that periodically updates the notification count. # Example Concept for Client Script: Below is a very simplified concept to give you an idea. This doesn't directly interact with provider notifications but provides a starting point for custom script development. \`\`\`javascript // This is a conceptual script and requires adjustments to fit your specific needs function updateNotificationCount() { var serverScript = new GlideAjax('YourAjaxProcessor'); serverScript.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getNotificationCount'); serverScript.getXMLAnswer(function(answer) { var count = parseInt(answer, 10); // Update your notification UI element here, e.g.: document.getElementById('notificationCountElement').textContent = count; }); } // Schedule this function to run periodically setInterval(updateNotificationCount, 30000); // Update every 30 seconds \`\`\` You need to create a server-side script include (\`YourAjaxProcessor\`) that handles the \`getNotificationCount\` operation, querying the database for the count of notifications that haven't been dismissed by the user. # Important Note: Keep in mind, customizing core functionality and UI elements can lead to maintenance overhead, especially during platform upgrades. Thoroughly test customizations in a sub-production instance and ensure they're documented for future maintenance and troubleshooting. Also, consider reaching out to ServiceNow support or your ServiceNow representative for the latest capabilities of the platform or any new features that might meet your requirements without extensive customization. ServiceNow continues to evolve, and newer versions might offer more straightforward solutions to your use case."},{"prompt":"Using Buy Item (POST) catalog API to submit a catalog item. This item has start date & end date. I have written an onsubmit catalog client script to validate the dates not be in the past. But the validation is not being evaluated through catalog API request. Any idea how to enforce this validation on API side","completion":"When catalog items are submitted through ServiceNow's Catalog API (for instance, using the \`/api/sn_sc/v1/servicecatalog/items/{sys_id}/order_now\` endpoint for ordering a catalog item), client-side scripts, including \`onSubmit\` catalog client scripts, are not executed. This is because the API request bypasses the client-side processing and interacts directly with the server-side components. Therefore, any validation that occurs on the client-side through JavaScript won’t be evaluated when an item is ordered through the API. To enforce validation on the API side, you will need to implement validation logic on the server side. This can be achieved using Business Rules or Script Includes that are invoked as part of the API process. Given that you're dealing with date validation for a catalog item, you might want to use a Business Rule that triggers before the record is inserted or updated (a 'before' Business Rule). # Steps to Create a 'Before' Business Rule for Validation 1. **Navigate** to \`System Definition > Business Rules\` and click \`New\` to create a new Business Rule. 2. **Configure the Business Rule** with the following suggested setup: - **Name**: Descriptive name, e.g., \\"Validate Catalog Item Dates\\". - **Table**: Choose the table that stores submissions for the catalog item orders. Typically, this would be \`sc_req_item\` for requested items, but could vary based on your setup. - **Advanced**: Check this option to write a script. - **When to run**: - **Before**: Check (since you want to validate before the record is saved). - **Insert**: Check (if you want the rule to apply to new records). - **Update**: Depending on your requirement, you may check this to apply the rule to updates as well. - **Filter Conditions**: If your date validation should only apply to specific conditions beyond just the creation of a record (for instance, only for a specific catalog item), specify those conditions here. 3. **Write the Validation Script** in the \\"Advanced\\" tab's script box: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Assuming 'start_date' and 'end_date' are the field names var startDate = new GlideDateTime(current.getValue('start_date')); var endDate = new GlideDateTime(current.getValue('end_date')); var now = GlideDateTime(); if (startDate < now || endDate < now) { // Cancel the current operation current.setAbortAction(true); // Optionally, you can add an error message (though this may not always be supported/seen by API clients) gs.addErrorMessage('Start date and end date cannot be in the past.'); } })(current, previous); \`\`\` 4. **Save** the Business Rule. # Important Notes: - This validation will now run on the server side before a record is inserted or updated in the specified table, whether the action comes from an API call or the ServiceNow UI. - The \`GlideDateTime()\` object is used for date comparison in business rules, which provides methods to accurately compare dates. - Keep in mind that \`setAbortAction(true)\` will prevent the record from being saved if the condition is met but won't inherently provide feedback to an API client; how the client handles or displays errors depends on the client implementation. - If the API client requires specific feedback on validation failure, you may need to build custom API endpoints using Scripted REST APIs that can include more sophisticated error handling and response messaging. This approach ensures that your validations are enforced consistently, regardless of whether the catalog item is submitted through the UI or via the API."},{"prompt":"Hello All, Like I have created one catalogue item and if the user submitted that form those details in the form should be automatically populated as a record in custom table not in RITM table.","completion":"To ensure the details from a submitted catalog item form populate a record in a custom table instead of the standard Requested Item (RITM) table in ServiceNow, you can utilize a Process Flow, Business Rule, or Workflow. The choice between these approaches depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Below, I detailed how to achieve this using a Workflow, as Workflows offer a visual and flexible way to manage the process and often are the preferred method for handling catalog item actions. # Creating a Workflow for a Service Catalog Item **1. Create Your Custom Table** Before setting up the workflow, ensure your custom table is created and structured to hold the necessary data from the catalog item form. - Navigate to **System Definition > Tables**. - Click **New** to create a custom table and define fields according to the data you expect from the catalog item form. **2. Define Your Catalog Item** Design your catalog item, specifying the variables (fields) you need to gather from users. These variables are what you'll map to the custom table's fields later in the Workflow. - Go to **Service Catalog > Catalog Definitions > Maintain Items**. - Click **New** to create a catalog item, defining variables like text fields, choice fields, etc., that match or correspond to the fields in your custom table. **3. Create the Workflow** Once your custom table and catalog item are set up, create a Workflow to automate the creation of a record in your custom table upon the submission of the catalog item. - Navigate to **Workflow > Workflow Editor**. - In the Workflow Editor, select **New** to create a new workflow. Choose the Catalog Item table (\`sc_cat_item\`) or Requested Item (\`sc_req_item\`) as the table this workflow applies to, depending on your setup. - Name your Workflow appropriately and begin designing it: - Add a **Begin** event. - Drag a **Catalog Task** or **Script Execution** Activity from the palette. - If using **Script Execution**: Write a script to insert a new record into your custom table using the values from the submitted catalog item. Access catalog item variables through \`current.variables.var_name\` where \`var_name\` is the name of your variable. \`\`\`javascript var gr = new GlideRecord('your_custom_table'); gr.initialize(); gr.your_field = current.variables.your_catalog_variable + ''; // Cast to string if necessary // Repeat for other fields gr.insert(); \`\`\` - Configure your Workflow activities according to your process, ensuring the script execution or catalog task that populates your custom table is properly set up with the data from \`current.variables\`. - Use conditions, approvals, or other logic as required by your catalog item process. - End your Workflow with an **End** event. **4. Associate the Workflow with Your Catalog Item** After creating your Workflow, ensure it’s associated with your catalog item: - Go back to your catalog item in **Service Catalog > Catalog Definitions > Maintain Items**. - In the catalog item form, find the **Workflow** field and select the Workflow you’ve created. - Save your changes to the catalog item. **5. Test Your Setup** - Navigate to the Service Catalog and submit your catalog item as a user would. - Verify that a new record is created in your custom table with the correct data from the catalog submission. By following these steps, when a user submits the specified catalog item form, the details should be automatically populated into a record in your custom table as designed in the Workflow, offering a flexible solution that can be adapted as your process evolves."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Extensions in Firefox are developed using WebExtensions APIs, which are largely compatible with the extension APIs supported by Chrome, Edge, and Opera. To accomplish this, you'll need to: 1. **Set Up Your Extension's Structure**: Create a manifest file and specify your background script, content scripts, and necessary permissions. 2. **Find the Target Links**: Use a content script to identify the links you want to automatically click. 3. **Simulate Clicks**: With your content script, simulate clicks on those links. 4. **Redirect and Modify the Subdomain**: Use a background script to listen for redirects and modify the subdomain as needed. # Step 1: Setting Up **manifest.json** \`\`\`json { \\"manifest_version\\": 2, \\"name\\": \\"Subdomain Redirector\\", \\"version\\": \\"1.0\\", \\"description\\": \\"Automatically clicks on specified links and redirects with modified subdomain.\\", \\"permissions\\": [ \\"activeTab\\", \\"<ALL_URLS>\\" ], \\"background\\": { \\"scripts\\": [\\"background.js\\"], \\"persistent\\": false }, \\"content_scripts\\": [ { \\"matches\\": [\\"<all_urls>\\"], \\"js\\": [\\"content.js\\"] } ] } \`\`\` # Step 2 & 3: Find and Click Links **content.js** \`\`\`javascript // Example for finding and clicking on links that contain 'example.com' const links = document.querySelectorAll('a[href*=\\"example.com\\"]'); links.forEach(link => { // Simulate a click on the link link.click(); }); \`\`\` # Step 4: Redirect and Modify Subdomain **background.js** \`\`\`javascript chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener( function(details) { const url = new URL(details.url); if (url.hostname.endsWith('example.com')) { // Modify the subdomain here as you need const newUrl = url.href.replace('//www.', '//subdomain.'); return {redirectUrl: newUrl}; } }, {urls: [\\"<all_urls>\\"]}, [\\"blocking\\"] ); \`\`\` This is a simple example. In real scenarios: - Ensure you have proper permissions in your \`manifest.json\`.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this functionality. # Step 1: Define Your Extension Structure Your extension will comprise at least three files: - \`manifest.json\`: Extension's metadata and permissions. - \`background.js\`: Background script for handling redirections. - \`content.js\`: Content script for intercepting clicks. # Step 2: Setup the Manifest File Create \`manifest.json\` with necessary permissions for web navigation and active tab manipulation. \`\`\`json { \\"manifest_version\\": 3, \\"name\\": \\"Selective Link Redirector\\", \\"version\\": \\"1.0\\", \\"description\\": \\"Intercepts specific link clicks and redirects if necessary.\\", \\"permissions\\": [ \\"webNavigation\\", \\"activeTab\\" ], \\"background\\": { \\"service_worker\\": \\"background.js\\" }, \\"content_scripts\\": [ { \\"matches\\": [\\"<all_urls>\\"], \\"js\\": [\\"content.js\\"] } ], \\"action\\": { \\"default_popup\\": \\"popup.html\\", \\"default_icon\\": { \\"16\\": \\"images/icon-16.png\\", \\"48\\": \\"images/icon-48.png\\", \\"128\\": \\"images/icon-128.png\\" } } } \`\`\` Adjust your permissions and files as needed. Note that \`manifest_version\` 3 is used here, which is the latest at the time of writing. # Step 3: Create the Content Script The content script, \`content.js\`, will listen for clicks on links and message the background script if a link matching certain criteria is clicked. \`\`\`javascript document.addEventListener('click', (event) => { let target = event.target; // Ensuring we only capture clicks on 'a' elements if (target.tagName !== 'A') { target = target.closest('a'); if (!target) return; } const href = target.href; // Checking if the link matches our pattern (example) if (href.includes(\\"example.com\\")) { event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default action // Sending message to the background script with the URL browser.runtime.sendMessage({redirect: href}); } }); \`\`\` # Step 4: Handling Redirects in the Background Script In \`background.js\`, listen for messages from the content script and execute the redirection. \`\`\`javascript browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message) => { if (message.redirect) { const url = new URL(message.redirect); // Here we change the subdomain as required, e.g., from www to sub const newUrl = url.href.replace(\\"//www.\\", \\"//sub.\\"); // Redirect the current tab to the new URL browser.tabs.update({url: newUrl}); } }); \`\`\` # Step 5: Testing Your Extension 1. Open Firefox and navigate to \`about:debugging\`. 2. Click \\"This Firefox\\" (or \\"Load Temporary Add-on\\" in older versions). 3. Select your \`manifest.json\` file to load the extension. 4.

This preference can help users who experience discomfort or seizures from animated content, making web browsing more accessible to them. When set, Firefox will signal web content to limit animations, ideally adhering to the CSS media feature \`prefers-reduced-motion\`. # How to Set \`ui.prefersReducedMotion\` in Firefox 1. **Through the Operating System Settings**: - Most modern operating systems offer accessibility settings that include an option to reduce motion. Firefox automatically respects these settings. - **On Windows**: Go to Settings > Ease of Access > Display, and turn on \\"Show animations in Windows.\\" - **On macOS**: Go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, and check \\"Reduce motion.\\" - **On iOS/Android**: Similar settings exist under the Accessibility menu. - When these system-wide settings are enabled, compatible web browsers, including Firefox, will automatically apply \`prefers-reduced-motion\` without any further configuration needed within the browser itself. 2. **Via Firefox's Configuration** (For Developers): - As of my last update, Firefox doesn't directly expose \`ui.prefersReducedMotion\` in its \`about:config\` page for users to toggle. However, developers can simulate \`prefers-reduced-motion\` for testing purposes through DevTools. - Here’s how to simulate \`prefers-reduced-motion\` via Firefox Developer Tools: 1.

Here’s an example in CSS: \`\`\`css @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .animated-element { animation: none; transition: none; } } \`\`\` And an example in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia(\\"(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)\\").matches; if (prefersReducedMotion) { // Disable animations } \`\`\` In essence, respecting \`ui.prefersReducedMotion\` helps developers create more accessible web content that serves everyone better, including those sensitive to motion on their screens."},{"prompt":"if in firefox adjust http or https proxy - can this proxy view all url in browser or only domain?","completion":"When you configure a proxy server in Firefox (or any other web browser) for HTTP or HTTPS traffic, the proxy has the ability to \\"see\\" different levels of data depending on whether the connection is over HTTP or HTTPS. Here is what the proxy can see in each case: # HTTP Connections For HTTP traffic, the proxy can see the entire request. This includes not just the domain, but also the full URL, headers, and body of the request. Since HTTP is an unencrypted protocol, all this information is in plaintext. So, if you visit \`http://example.com/page.html\` via an HTTP proxy, the proxy can see the full URL (\`http://example.com/page.html\`), what data is sent, and potentially modify the content before it gets back to you. # HTTPS Connections For HTTPS traffic, the situation is different due to the encryption between the client (the browser) and the server (the website). When you use a proxy with HTTPS, the proxy can see the domain you are connecting to, because the initial connection setup, known as the SSL/TLS handshake, occurs in a way that the proxy knows where to route your encrypted data. However, because of the encryption, the proxy cannot see the full URL or any other specific data sent over the connection. For example, if you visit \`https://example.com/page.html\`, the proxy sees only the domain portion (\`example.com\`) but not the specific page or query parameters (\`/page.html\` or anything after). It also cannot see the data in the request or the response. # Important Considerations - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: If a proxy is malicious or compromised, it could attempt a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. For HTTPS connections, this typically involves presenting a false certificate to the client. Browsers will generally warn users when this happens, assuming the malicious certificate is not trusted or installed in the system's trust store. - **Special Configuration**: In some cases, users or organizations install specific certificates in their systems to allow proxies (such as those used for filtering or monitoring in corporate environments) to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt HTTPS traffic.

Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React.js that enables functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. Below is a simple guide to creating a basic ToDo app with Next.js. This app will allow users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and filter between all tasks vs. completed tasks. # Setup Your Next.js Project First, you need to set up a new Next.js project if you haven't done so already. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer, then run these commands in your terminal: \`\`\`bash npx create-next-app@latest my-todo-app cd my-todo-app \`\`\` This command creates a new Next.js app in a directory called \`my-todo-app\` and moves into that directory. # Create the ToDo Component Navigate to the \`pages\` directory, and create a new file called \`todo.js\`. This file will contain your ToDo app component. The basic structure of your component will be like so: \`\`\`jsx // pages/todo.js import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Todo() { const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]); const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(\\"\\"); // Function to add a task const addTask = () => { if (!inputValue) return; // Return if input is empty setTasks([...tasks, { id: Date.now(), text: inputValue, completed: false }]); setInputValue(''); // Clear input field after adding }; // Function to toggle task completed state const toggleTask = id => { setTasks(tasks.map(task => task.id === id ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task)); }; return ( <div> <h1>ToDo App</h1> <input type=\\"text\\" value={inputValue} onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)} placeholder=\\"Add a new task\\" /> <button onClick={addTask}>Add Task</button> <ul> {tasks.map(task => ( <li key={task.id} style={{ textDecoration: task.completed ? 'line-through' : 'none' }}> {task.text} <input type=\\"checkbox\\" checked={task.completed} onChange={() => toggleTask(task.id)} /> </li> ))} </ul> </div> ); } \`\`\` This component consists of: - **State for tasks**: An array to store tasks. - **State for inputValue**: The current value of the text input field. - **addTask**: A function that adds a new task to the tasks array. - **toggleTask**: A function that toggles a task's completed state between true and false. # Run Your Next.js App Make sure you're still in your project's root directory, then start the development server: \`\`\`bash npm run dev \`\`\` Your Next.js app will be available at \`http://localhost:3000/\`. You can see your ToDo app by navigating to \`http://localhost:3000/todo\`. # Conclusion This is a very basic implementation of a ToDo app with Next.js. As you get more comfortable, you can expand this application by: - Adding persistent storage (e.g., integrate with a database or local storage) - Implementing task deletion - Adding task editing functionality - Creating separate components for the input form, task list, and individual tasks for better structure and maintainability Keep experimenting and adding features to enhance your understanding of Next.js and React."},{"prompt":"Quelle différence existe il entre une strate et une grappe ?","completion":"Une strate fait référence à un niveau hiérarchique dans une organisation ou dans une société, tandis qu'une grappe désigne un ensemble de fruits ou de fleurs regroupés.

In the pre-chorus, \\"With each dawn that rose, devotion outpours\\" — as previously discussed, \\"devotion outpours\\" is understandable but slightly unconventional. You might consider \\"devotion pours forth\\" for a more standard expression, but your original phrasing has a poetic quality that is also appealing. 2. In the first chorus, \\"I'm yours to control, whatever my role\\" and its repetition with a slight variation in the second chorus \\"I'm yours to control, regardless of role\\" are effective in conveying the message of complete surrender and willingness to serve. The slight change from \\"whatever my role\\" to \\"regardless of role\\" offers a subtle emphasis on the theme of unconditional service and flexibility. 3. The verses beautifully expand on the themes introduced in the pre-chorus and chorus, exploring the depth of the speaker's devotion and the nature of their relationship with the addressed \\"Master\\" or \\"king.\\" The imagery and expressions of loyalty and service are vivid and consistent throughout. 4. The outro isn't provided in your submission. If you're looking to conclude the song, you might consider echoing a key line or theme from earlier in the song for closure. Alternatively, ending with a new line that encapsulates the overall message or leaves the listener with a final, impactful thought could also be effective.

语义核通常用于计算文本或词语之间的相似度或关系。 - 它是一种将文本数据映射到一个特征空间的技术，该特征空间中，相似的概念或词语被映射到相互靠近的位置。这种映射是通过某种形式的内核函数来完成的，这个内核函数能够捕捉到文本中的语义信息。 - 举个例子，通过比较两段文本在特征空间中的距离，我们可以评估它们的语义相似度。 2. **Text Generation（文本生成）**: - 文本生成是指利用模型自动生成文本的过程。这个过程可以通过多种方式实现，比如基于规则的方法、统计方法以及近年来越来越流行的基于深度学习的模型，如GPT（Generative Pretrained Transformer）。 - 文本生成的应用范围非常广泛，包括自动撰写新闻报道、生成聊天机器人的回复、创造新的文学作品等。 3. **Text Embeddings（文本嵌入）**: - 文本嵌入是一种将词语或文本转换为固定长度的向量的技术。每个词或文本的向量表示能够捕捉到其含义、语法、上下文关系等属性。 - 文本嵌入的目的是将自然语言转换为机器学习模型能够处理的数值形式。这样，模型就可以利用这些向量进行诸如分类、预测等任务。 - 文本嵌入的范例包括Word2Vec、GloVe（Global Vectors for Word Representation）和最近的BERT（Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers）模型等。 总结而言： - **Semantic Kernel**主要用于分析文本之间的相似性。 - **Text Generation**用于自动生成文本内容。 - **Text Embeddings**则是将文本转换为模型可处理的数值向量。 这三者虽然在NLP领域内，但服务的需求和解决的问题截然不同。"},{"prompt":"TextGeneration和TextEmbeddings 有什么差别","completion":"Text Generation（文本生成）和Text Embeddings（文本嵌入）是自然语言处理（NLP）领域的两个主要技术，它们服务于不同的目的并使用不同的方法。让我们探讨它们之间的主要差异： # 目的和应用 **Text Generation:** -

应用包括文本相似度评估、情感分析、文本分类等。 - 常见的文本嵌入技术包括Word2Vec、GloVe和BERT。这些技术能够捕获单词的上下文含义，并为文本处理任务提供强大的特征表示。 # 技术方法 **Text Generation:** - 通常基于深度学习模型，如循环神经网络（RNN）、长短期记忆（LSTM）和Transformer模型。 - 这些模型能够根据给定的输入序列（一段文本）预测下一个最可能的单词序列（接下来的文本）。 **Text Embeddings:** - 通过将文本中的单词或短语映射到高维空间中的点来实现。 - 使用预训练模型如Word2Vec、GloVe将单词转换为向量，或使用BERT类模型将更长的文本片段（句子、段落）嵌入到向量空间中。 # 结果表示 **Text Generation:** - 输出是自动生成的文本，其形式依赖于给定的任务（如段落、对话等）。 **Text Embeddings:** - 输出是文本（单词、句子或段落）的数值表示（向量），其中向量的每个维度代表某种文本特征或概念。 综上所述，Text Generation的核心目标是创造新的文本内容，而Text Embeddings的核心任务是为现有的文本内容提供一种数值化的、易于机器处理的表示形式。这二者在自然语言处理领域中互相补充，但服务于完全不同的目的和应用场景。"},{"prompt":"TextGeneration 和 ChatCompletion 差别","completion":"Text Generation（文本生成）和Chat Completion（聊天补全）虽然都属于自然语言处理（NLP）的应用范畴，但它们在目标、应用场景和技术实现上有所不同。下面是这两者之间的一些关键区别： # 目的和应用 **Text Generation:** - 目标是生成有语义连贯性和主题相关性的文本。这可以是任何形式的文本，如新闻文章、故事、诗歌等。 - 应用范围广泛，不仅限于对话系统，还包括内容创作、自动新闻报道生成、产品描述生成等。 **Chat Completion:** - 目标是在一个对话或聊天中生成下一句或几句话，以使对话自然连续。 - 应用主要集中在聊天机器人、虚拟助手和其他对话系统中，重点在于根据上下文和对话历史生成恰当的回复。 # 技术实现 **Text Generation:** - 通常利用大型的预训练语言模型，如GPT系列（Generative Pretrained Transformer），通过学习大量的文本数据来生成文本。 - 这些模型可以基于某个起始提示词或句子来生成一段连贯的文本内容。 **Chat Completion:** - 虽然也可以使用类似的预训练语言模型，但在对话补全中，模型更需要考虑到对话的上下文和交互性。 - 聊天补全通常需要更灵活地处理突发的主题转换、理解用户意图和回答特定的问题。 # 交互性 **Text Generation:** - 文本生成可能更侧重于“一次性”产出，即基于某个输入生成一大段文本，而不需要与用户进行交云。 **Chat Completion:** - 聊天补全强调的是与用户的互动性，需要在每一轮对话中根据用户的输入实时生成回复。这要求模型具有高度的适应性和对即时信息的快速处理能力。 总体而言，Text Generation更侧重于生成各种类型的文本内容，而Chat Completion则专注于生成对话中的下一句话或几句话，以实现与用户的自然交互。两者都依赖于先进的NLP技术和深度学习模型，但它们的应用场景和交互性有着明显的差别。"},{"prompt":"BasicPlanner ActionPlanner SequentialPlanner StepwisePlanner 有什么区别，请作为Semantic Kernel 的专家来，给我提供深入浅出的解释，假设我是一个这方面的初学程序员。并提供相关的例子让我理解。","completion":"在解释这些计划制定技术之前，我们首先需要理解，在人工智能（AI）和机器人学领域中，\\"planner\\"或\\"planning algorithm\\"是指用于计划和决策的算法，它们帮助AI系统或机器人决定如何从当前状态移动到目标状态。理解了这个概念后，我们就可以更好地区分BasicPlanner、ActionPlanner、SequentialPlanner和StepwisePlanner这几种规划技术了。 # BasicPlanner **BasicPlanner**是最简单的规划技术之一。它通常指基于简单规则的决策过程，没有复杂的决策逻辑。例如，一个BasicPlanner可能仅仅根据当前状态直接选择下一个动作，而不考虑这个动作将如何影响未来的状态。 **例子**：假设一个清洁机器人有一个简单的任务：在一个房间里找到并收集垃圾。BasicPlanner只会让机器人向离它最近的垃圾移动，而不考虑最有效的路径来清理整个房间中的所有垃圾。 # ActionPlanner **ActionPlanner**关注于制定一系列特定的动作来达到目标。与BasicPlanner相比，它更加关注于如何通过一系列步骤达到最终的目标，可能会使用到一些启发式方法来评估和选择最佳动作。 **例子**：同样对于清洁机器人，ActionPlanner不仅考虑当前可以执行的动作，还会规划一个动作序列，比如首先清理最近的垃圾，然后移动到下一个区域，直到清理完所有已知的垃圾。 # SequentialPlanner **SequentialPlanner**更进一步，它遵循一个固定的步骤或顺序来完成任务。这种规划技术涉及到了详细的步骤规划，以确保任务以最有效的方式完成。SequentialPlanner往往在已知环境中效果最好。 **例子**：对清洁机器人而言，SequentialPlanner可能会提前规划一个清洗房间的固定顺序，比如先清理门后的区域，再清理窗户下的区域，最后清理中间区域，以此类推。 # StepwisePlanner **StepwisePlanner**专注于逐步决策。与SequentialPlanner不同，StepwisePlanner可能在每一步都进行重新评估和调整计划。这种类型的规划器更加灵活，能够适应环境的变化和未知的情况。 **例子**：清洁机器人在执行清洁任务时，如果发现某个区域的垃圾比预期的多，StepwisePlanner会调整计划，先清理这个区域，并根据实时情况调整后续的清理计划。 总结 每种规划技术都有其适用的场景。BasicPlanner适用于简单和预测性强的任务；ActionPlanner适用于需要一系列动作来达成目标的情况；SequentialPlanner在任务和环境相对固定时效果最好；而StepwisePlanner则适用于环境不断变化或有许多未知因素的情况。理解这些差异有助于选择或设计适合特定应用的规划算法。"},{"prompt":"Azure AI Search Chroma DuckDB Milvus Pinecone Postgres Qdrant Redis Sqlite Weaviate 他们的区别和优缺点 使用场景都说一下","completion":"Azure AI Search、Chroma、DuckDB、Milvus、Pinecone、Postgres、Qdrant、Redis、SQLite和Weaviate是不同类型的技术和服务，它们在功能、设计目标和使用场景上有所差异。我们将分别简要介绍它们的特点、优缺点和典型使用场景。 # Azure AI Search **特点**：Azure AI Search是一个云服务，提供强大的搜索能力，可以轻松地将搜索功能集成到应用中。它结合了AI的能力，可以处理自然语言查询，提供用户意图识别、地理位置搜索等功能。 **优缺点**： -

Что в нем особенного?","completion":"Озеро Байкал, расположенное на юго-востоке Сибири в России, по праву считается чем-то вроде природного чуда по множеству причин. Вот несколько аспектов, делающих его уникальным и особенным: 1. **Возраст и глубина.** Байкал - самое глубокое озеро на планете, его максимальная глубина достигает примерно 1642 метра. Кроме того, оно является одним из старейших озер мира, его возраст оценивается в 25-30 миллионов лет. 2. **Объем воды.** Озеро содержит около 20% не замерзшей пресной воды на Земле, что делает его крупнейшим резервуаром пресной воды. 3. **Биоразнообразие.** В Байкале обитает около 2 500 видов и подвидов животных, и 70% из них являются эндемиками, то есть встречаются только в этой местности. Примером уникального животного является байкальская нерпа – единственная в своем роде пресноводная тюленья в мире. 4. **Чистота воды.** Благодаря особым видам микроорганизмов, вода в Байкале остается чрезвычайно чистой и прозрачной. В некоторых местах прозрачность достигает 40 метров. 5. **Геология и тектоника.** Байкал находится в зоне Байкальского рифта, что делает его одним из немногих озер в мире, расположенных на рифтовой зоне.

Instead, let me show you how one could structure a few of these \`INSERT\` statements for your specified table, and then we'll outline how you might automate or extend this process to generate many more, either manually or through scripting. # Sample INSERT Statements: Below are a few \`INSERT\` statements to illustrate how you might start populating your table with a diversity of data across the partitions determined by the \`Years\` column: \`\`\`sql INSERT INTO CDMTDFMGR.sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order VALUES (1, 'USA', 'Online', 'Electronic', 'Mobile Phones', 'Smartphones', 'Phone Model X', 2014, 'Q1', 500.00, 30, 150.00); INSERT INTO CDMTDFMGR.sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order VALUES (2, 'Canada', 'Retail', 'Home Appliances', 'Kitchen Appliances', 'Mixers', 'Mixer Model Y', 2012, 'Q2', 200.00, 20, 80.00); INSERT INTO CDMTDFMGR.sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order VALUES (3, 'Mexico', 'Online', 'Fashion', 'Men Clothing', 'Formal', 'Suit Model Z', 2011, 'Q3', 700.00, 50, 300.00); -- This pattern continues for each unique product_id and varying other attributes accordingly. \`\`\` # Extending This Process for 50 Records: For extending this to 50 or more records, a few approaches are possible: 1. **Manually** — Continue the pattern of the above inserts, carefully varying the \`product_id\` and other attributes as necessary. This approach can be time-consuming and error-prone for large numbers of records. 2. **Spreadsheet Software** — You could use Excel or Google Sheets to generate these statements. Lay out your data in columns matching your table schema, then use a formula to concatenate the values into a full SQL statement. For example, in Excel, given values starting in row 2, a formula might look like: \`\`\`excel =\\"INSERT INTO CDMTDFMGR.sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order VALUES (\\" & A2 & \\", '\\" & B2 & \\"', '\\" & C2 & \\"', '\\" & D2 & \\"', '\\" & E2 & \\"', '\\" & F2 & \\"', '\\" & G2 & \\"', \\" & H2 & \\", '\\" & I2 & \\"', \\" & J2 & \\", \\" & K2 & \\", \\" & L2 & \\");\\" \`\`\` 3. **Scripting** — Writing a script in Python, Bash, PowerShell, etc., to generate these statements. This is the most flexible and powerful approach, as it allows for randomness or patterns in the data, and can easily output a large number of rows. Below is a very basic Python example to generate insert statements for your table: \`\`\`python for i in range(1, 51): print(f\\"INSERT INTO CDMTDFMGR.sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order VALUES ({i}, 'Country{i%3}', 'Channel{i%2}', 'StoreType{i%4}', 'Category{i%5}', 'Line{i%6}', 'Product{i}', {2011+i%4}, 'Q{i%4+1}', {100+i*10.0}, {i%10+1}, {30+i*5.0});\\") \`\`\` This Python script uses the modulo operator to vary some of the attributes across inserts, ensuring a diverse set of sample data. Adjust the logic to match the exact nature of variety you'd need in your \`INSERT\` statements. Remember, you would need to adjust these approaches according to your exact use case, especially in ensuring that \`product_id\` remains unique if it's necessary for your application logic."},{"prompt":"ماذا لو؟ كتبت كتاباً حول وقوع في حب شخص لا يبادلك نفس الشعور ماذا سيكون السطر الاخير لكتابك؟🖤✨","completion":"في النهاية، تعلمت أن الحب لا يتطلب المكوث في مكان لا تتبادل فيه

Kontroler ten będzie odpowiedzialny za obsługę żądań HTTP dotyczących formularza rejestracji. \`\`\`pseudo class RegisterController { public void handleRequest(HttpRequest request) { UserData userData = extractUserDataFromRequest(request); if(validateUserData(userData)) { saveUserData(userData); sendResponse(\\"Rejestracja zakończona sukcesem!\\"); } else { sendResponse(\\"Błąd w danych rejestracyjnych!\\"); } } private UserData extractUserDataFromRequest(HttpRequest request) { // Ekstrahowanie danych użytkownika z żądania (np. z use of request parameters) return new UserData(/* parametry */); } private boolean validateUserData(UserData userData) { // Walidacja danych użytkownika (np. czy email nie jest już używany) // Zwraca true jeśli dane są poprawne, w przeciwnym razie false } private void saveUserData(UserData userData) { // Zapisywanie danych użytkownika w bazie danych } private void sendResponse(String message) { // Wysyłanie odpowiedzi do użytkownika } } \`\`\` # 3. Uruchomienie Aby uruchomić nasz Front Controller, wystarczy wywołać metodę \`handleRequest\` z odpowiednim obiektem żądania HTTP. W prawdziwej aplikacji webowej żądanie to byłoby otrzymane bezpośrednio z serwera HTTP. \`\`\`pseudo HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest(URL = \\"/register\\", /* inne parametry */); FrontController frontController = new FrontController(); frontController.handleRequest(request); \`\`\` Przedstawiony pseudokod ilustruje podstawową ideę wzorca Front Controller. W praktycznych implementacjach, szczególnie w ramach konkretnych ram pracy lub serwerów aplikacji, mechanizmy są znacznie bardziej rozbudowane i mogą uwzględniać dodatkowe aspekty takie jak mapowanie URLi do kontrolerów za pomocą konfiguracji, automatyczna walidacja danych wejściowych, mechanizmy bezpieczeństwa itp."},{"prompt":"Jak taki kod wyglądałby w php","completion":"Zastosowanie wzorca Front Controller w PHP może się różnić w zależności od podejścia i specyfiki projektu. Jednak podstawowa koncepcja pozostaje podobna. Poniżej przedstawiam przykład prostego zastosowania wzorca Front Controller w PHP, skupiając się na procesie przetwarzania formularza rejestracji użytkownika. # 1. Front Controller (index.php) Typowo, w PHP, wszystkie żądania mogą być przekierowane do jednego pliku (na przykład \`index.php\`) przy użyciu pliku \`.htaccess\` dla serwera Apache. Plik \`index.php\` pełni wtedy rolę Front Controllera. Zakładając, że mamy taki przekierowanie, możemy zacząć od \`index.php\`: \`\`\`php <?php // prosty autoloader klas (w rzeczywisty projektach lepiej używać Composer) spl_autoload_register(function (className) { include 'controllers/' . className . '.php'; }); // Get the path from the request path = _SERVER['PATH_INFO'] ?? '/'; // Mapowanie URL do kontrolerów routes = [ '/' => 'HomeController', '/register' => 'RegisterController', ]; // Prosta obsługa routingu if (array_key_exists(path, routes)) { controllerName = routes[path]; controller = new controllerName; controller->handleRequest(); } else { header(\\"HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found\\"); echo '404 - Not Found'; } \`\`\` # 2. Kontroler rejestracji (controllers/RegisterController.php) \`\`\`php <?php class RegisterController { public function handleRequest() { if (_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') { this->processRegistrationForm(); } else { this->showRegistrationForm(); } } private function processRegistrationForm() { // Tutaj powinna być implementacja procesu rejestracji, jak weryfikacja danych // W praktyce należy użyć filter_input lub filter_var do walidacji i sanitacji danych z _POST username = _POST['username'] ?? ''; email = _POST['email'] ?? ''; password = _POST['password'] ?? ''; // Przykładowa walidacja if (empty(username) || empty(email) || empty(password)) { echo \\"Błąd: Wszystkie pola są wymagane.\\"; return; } // Logika dotycząca zapisu danych (omitowana dla uproszczenia) echo \\"Rejestracja zakończona sukcesem. Witaj, \\" . htmlspecialchars(username) . \\"!\\"; } private function showRegistrationForm() { // Prosty formularz rejestracji (w prawdziwych projektach lepiej trzymać widoki w oddzielnych plikach) echo '<form method=\\"post\\" action=\\"/register\\"> Username: <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"username\\"><br> Email: <input type=\\"email\\" name=\\"email\\"><br> Password: <input type=\\"password\\" name=\\"password\\"><br> <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Register\\"> </form>'; } } \`\`\` # 3. Plik .htaccess Plik \`.htaccess\` przekierowuje wszystkie żądania do \`index.php\`, co umożliwia działanie Front Controllera. \`\`\` RewriteEngine On # Przekierowanie, jeśli plik lub katalog nie istnieje RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L] \`\`\` Pamiętaj, aby dostosować konfigurację serwera lub ustawienia lokalne, aby umożliwić odczytywanie i przetwarzanie pliku \`.htaccess\`. Przedstawione wyżej kroki ilustrują podstawowe wykorzystanie wzorca Front Controller w aplikacji PHP do obsługi formularza rejestracji. To podejście może być rozwijane o bardziej zaawansowane funkcje, takie jak obsługa błędów, walidacja danych po stronie serwera, system szablonów dla widoków, obsługa sesji i bezpieczeństwo."},{"prompt":"Please generate insert statements for ddl CREATE SET TABLE CDMTDFMGR.sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order ,FALLBACK , NO BEFORE JOURNAL, NO AFTER JOURNAL, CHECKSUM = DEFAULT, DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO, MAP = TD_MAP1 ( product_id INTEGER, Seller_Country VARCHAR(14) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Channel_Type VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Store_Type VARCHAR(22) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Product_Category VARCHAR(24) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Product_Line VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Product VARCHAR(33) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Years INTEGER, Quarter VARCHAR(7) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, Sales_Value FLOAT, Units_Sold INTEGER, Margin FLOAT) PRIMARY INDEX ( product_id ) PARTITION BY CASE_N( Years > 2013 , Years > 2012 , Years > 2011 , NO CASE, UNKNOWN);","completion":"Given your provided DDL statement for creating a table named \`sample_WA_sales_csv_multipartition_order\` on Teradata, the INSERT statements to populate your table would look something like this.

European nations formed opposing alliances as a way to maintain a balance of power and to protect themselves against the threat of aggression from other countries. The complex web of alliances was intended to deter conflict, but it also meant that if war broke out between any two countries, their allies would be drawn into the conflict, potentially escalating a minor altercation into a broader war. 2. Austria-Hungary's alliance system, particularly its close relationship with Germany, influenced its decision to send Serbia an ultimatum after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Knowing that Germany would support them, Austria-Hungary felt emboldened to make harsh demands on Serbia, which ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I as the alliances activated. 3. Germany's invasion of Belgium brought Britain into the war because Belgium was neutral, and Britain had guaranteed its neutrality. The invasion violated Belgian sovereignty and international law, prompting Britain to declare war on Germany in defense of Belgium and to uphold the balance of power in Europe. 4. Trench warfare is a form of land warfare where opposing armies fight each other from lines of dugout trenches. This style of warfare became infamous during World War I for its difficult conditions, high casualty rates, and the resulting stalemate, as neither side could gain a decisive advantage. 5. The Schlieffen Plan was Germany's military strategy at the outbreak of World War I, designed to avoid a two-front war by quickly defeating France in the west through a rapid invasion via Belgium, before turning to fight Russia in the east. The plan ultimately failed, leading to a prolonged stalemate on the Western Front. 6. A stalemate is a situation in warfare where neither side can gain an advantage or achieve a decisive victory. On the Western Front during World War I, a stalemate developed due to the effective use of defensive fortifications, such as trench systems, and the failure of offensive tactics to break through these defenses, leading to a prolonged and costly deadlock. 7. President Wilson believed World War I was \\"the war to end all wars\\" because he hoped that the unprecedented scale of destruction and loss of life would lead nations to work towards peace and resolve conflicts without resorting to war in the future. He saw the war as an opportunity to reshape international relations and establish mechanisms like the League of Nations to prevent future conflicts. 8. The refusal of the US to join the League of Nations weakened the League's power by depriving it of the support of one of the world's strongest and most influential nations. Without the participation and backing of the United States, the League lacked the authority and means to effectively enforce its decisions and maintain peace among nations."},{"prompt":"define thsese very short entente militarism Alsace and Lorraine ultimatum mobilize neutrality stalemate zepplin U-boat convoy Dardanelles total war Lusitania propoganda Fourteen Points self-determination armistice pandemic reparation mandate Questions - Use your textbook Chapter 8 to answer the following questions 1.

How did the refusal of teh US to jooin the League of NAtions weaken teh Leagues Power?","completion":"1. **Why did the European nations form opposing alliances?** European nations formed opposing alliances primarily due to a complex web of nationalism, militarism, imperialism, and the desire for security. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant tensions due to empire building and rivalry. Countries sought to protect their interests and maintain the balance of power through alliances. The two major alliances that developed were the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, and the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and Britain. These alliances were meant as deterrents but ultimately contributed to the escalation of World War I after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. 2. **How did Austria's alliance system influence Austria's decision to send Serbia an ultimatum?** Austria-Hungary's decision to send Serbia an ultimatum after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was significantly influenced by its alliance with Germany. Knowing it had the backing of Germany, often referred to as the \\"blank check\\" assurance, Austria-Hungary felt emboldened to take a hardline approach against Serbia, anticipating that Serbia’s ally, Russia, might intervene. The alliance system thus propelled Austria-Hungary into a more confrontational stance than it might have taken otherwise. 3. **How did Germany's Invasion of Belgium bring Britain into the war?** The invasion of Belgium by Germany directly led to Britain entering World War I due to a treaty Britain had with Belgium. The 1839 Treaty of London obligated Britain to defend Belgium's neutrality. When Germany executed the Schlieffen Plan, invading Belgium to quickly advance into France, Britain issued an ultimatum to Germany to withdraw its troops from Belgium. Germany's refusal led Britain to declare war on August 4, 1914, honoring its commitment to Belgium and fearing German control of the Belgian coast. 4. **What is trench warfare?** Trench warfare is a form of combat in which opposing troops fight from trenches facing each other. This method of warfare became notoriously symbolic of World War I, particularly on the Western Front. Trench systems stretched from the North Sea to the Swiss Frontier with France, providing soldiers protection from enemy fire. Conditions were harsh, and the warfare was characterized by its stagnation, massive casualties for minor territorial gains, and the psychological toll on soldiers due to the squalid conditions and constant danger. 5. **Describe the Schlieffen Plan.** The Schlieffen Plan was a military strategy developed by Germany, named after General Count Alfred von Schlieffen, who designed it in 1905. The plan was intended to enable Germany to wage a successful two-front war against France and Russia. The strategy called for a rapid invasion and defeat of France through Belgium before Russia could fully mobilize its forces, allowing Germany to then shift its focus to the Eastern Front. The execution of this plan at the outset of World War I, however, did not go as intended, leading to a prolonged stalemate. 6. **What is a stalemate and why did one develop on the Western Front?** A stalemate occurs when neither side in a conflict can achieve a decisive victory or make significant progress. On the Western Front during World War I, a stalemate developed due to the effective use of trench warfare, which made it difficult for either side to advance without suffering significant casualties. The introduction of new military technologies, like machine guns and barbed wire, favored defense over offense, further contributing to the deadlock. The result was a grueling four-year standoff, with massive losses for minimal territorial gains. 7. **Why did President Wilson think that World War I was \\"the war to end wars\\"?** President Woodrow Wilson viewed World War I as \\"the war to end all wars\\" because he believed that it could lead to a transformation in international relations and the establishment of a lasting peace. He introduced the Fourteen Points as a blueprint for postwar peace and proposed the creation of the League of Nations, an international organization aimed at resolving conflicts and preventing future wars through diplomacy and collective security. 8. **How did the refusal of the US to join the League of Nations weaken the League's Power?** The refusal of the United States to join the League of Nations significantly weakened the organization’s authority and effectiveness. The U.S., emerging from World War I as a major world power, was envisioned by Wilson as playing a leading role in the League to enforce peace and resolve disputes. Without the participation of the United States, the League lacked the necessary clout and resources to effectively manage international crises, making it difficult to prevent aggression and address violations of treaties or international norms. This undermined the League’s ability to fulfill its mission and contributed to its eventual failure to prevent future conflicts like World War II."},{"prompt":"Key Terms - Please define nthe following entente militarism Alsace and Lorraine ultimatum mobilize neutrality stalemate zepplin U-boat convoy Dardanelles total war Lusitania propoganda Fourteen Points self-determination armistice pandemic reparation mandate","completion":"1. **Entente:** An entente is a non-binding agreement between two or more countries to follow certain policies in matters of common concern. It is less formal than an alliance but indicates a friendly understanding and cooperation. The most notable during the early 20th century was the Triple Entente among France, Russia, and Britain before World War I. 2. **Militarism:** Militarism is the belief or policy that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend or promote national interests. It often leads to an arms race between competing nations. 3. **Alsace and Lorraine:** These are regions in eastern France, rich in coal and iron, which have historically been contested between France and Germany. Germany annexed these territories after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, but France regained them after World War I. 4. **Ultimatum:** An ultimatum is a final demand or statement of terms issued by one party to another, often threatening severe consequences if the terms are not accepted. Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was a key event leading to World War I. 5. **Mobilize:** To mobilize a country's armed forces is to organize and prepare them for active service, typically in response to a threat or in the lead-up to a military conflict. This process involves calling up military reserves and readying equipment and supplies for action. 6. **Neutrality:** Neutrality is the policy or stance of a state not to participate in a conflict or war between other states. A neutral country does not take sides or provide assistance to the belligerents. 7. **Stalemate:** A stalemate is a situation in a conflict where neither side can make progress or gain advantage, leading to a deadlock. In World War I, the Western Front was characterized by a prolonged stalemate due to trench warfare. 8. **Zeppelin:** A Zeppelin is a type of rigid airship named after the German inventor Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. During World War I, they were used by Germany for reconnaissance and bombing missions over Britain and the front lines. 9. **U-boat:** U-boats were German submarines used extensively during both World Wars, particularly famous for their roles in unrestricted submarine warfare, targeting military and civilian ships. 10. **Convoy:** A convoy is a group of ships sailing together, protected by armed naval vessels, used to transport troops, supplies, or merchant ships during wartime. It was a tactic particularly used during World Wars to protect against submarine attacks. 11. **Dardanelles:** A strategic strait in northwestern Turkey connecting the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara. It was the site of a significant campaign in World War I where the Allies attempted to seize control to open a supply route to Russia and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. 12. **Total War:** Total war is a type of warfare that involves mobilizing all of a nation's resources—military, economic, and civilian—towards the war effort. It recognizes no boundaries between frontlines and civilian sectors, targeting both military and economic structures to weaken the enemy. 13. **Lusitania:** The Lusitania was a British ocean liner sunk by a German U-boat in 1915. The sinking, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 civilians, including Americans, significantly turned public opinion in neutral countries against Germany and moved the United States closer to entering World War I. 14. **Propaganda:** Propaganda refers to information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view. During World War I, it was extensively used by all sides to boost morale, recruit soldiers, and justify the war effort to the public. 15. **Fourteen Points:** The Fourteen Points were principles for peace post-World War I proposed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in 1918. They aimed to resolve territorial disputes, promote trade freedom, and establish a League of Nations to prevent future conflicts. 16. **Self-determination:** Self-determination is the right of people to choose their own form of government and destiny without external influence. It was a key principle promoted by Wilson's Fourteen Points, advocating for the rights of national groups to have their own sovereign states. 17. **Armistice:** An armistice is a formal agreement by warring parties to stop fighting while a peace treaty is negotiated. The Armistice of November 11, 1918, ended the fighting on the Western Front of World War I. 18. **Pandemic:** A pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of the population. The 1918 Spanish flu, which occurred during and after WWI, is an example of a devastating pandemic. 19. **Reparation:** Reparations are payments made by a defeated country to compensate for damage or injury during a war. Following World War I, the Treaty of Versailles required Germany to make significant financial reparations to the Allied powers. 20. **Mandate:** A mandate is a territory administered by a member of the League of Nations following World War I. The mandate system was intended to prepare territories for independence, but in practice, it often resulted in extended foreign control over the territories."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Однак важливо зазначити, що фраза \\"і мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим…\\" не є назвою окремої поеми Шевченка, але ці слова зустрічаються у його творах і відображають ключові теми його творчості. Ця фраза символізує ідею звернення до всіх поколінь українців: до тих, хто вже покинув цей світ, до тих, хто живе зараз, і до тих, хто ще народиться в майбутньому. Це вираження широкого зв'язку між поколіннями, акцент на спадкоємності боротьби, культури, мови та ідентичності. Шевченко в своїх творах піднімає питання соціальної несправедливості, політичного поневолення, ідентичності, любові до Батьківщини, важливості освіти та культури для національної ідентифікації та самосвідомості. Тарас Шевченко активно використовував свою поезію як інструмент проти царського режиму та кріпацтва, заставляючи своїх читачів замислитись над історичним минулим України та її майбутнім. Він зображував страждання і сподівання простих українців, закликаючи до загальнолюдських цінностей, таких як свобода, гідність і братерство. У контексті Шевченкового звернення \\"і мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим…\\" може йтися про його бажання збудити в людях свідомість і відповідальність за долю власного народу, за його майбутнє, за відродження культури та мови. Шевченко розумів, що боротьба за свободу та незалежність не обмежується одним поколінням, а є спадковою місією, яку необхідно передавати від одного покоління до іншого. Отже, фраза \\"і мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим…\\" набуває глибокого значення у контексті Шевченкової творчості, акцентуючи на вічній відповідальності перед поколіннями, на неперервному ланцюгу боротьби за краще майбутнє."},{"prompt":"про що розповідається в поемі і мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим… Тарас Шевченко","completion":"Поема Тараса Шевченка \\"І мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим...\\" входить до циклу \\"В казематі\\" і була написана в 1847 році під час ув'язнення поета в Петербурзькому казематі після арешту за звинуваченням у причетності до діяльності Кирило-Мефодіївського братства. Відомо, що цю поему Шевченко присвятив своїм друзям по братству. У цьому творі Шевченко звертається до минулого, сучасного і майбутнього України. Він розмірковує про долю та місію українського народу, його боротьбу за власну ідентичність та незалежність. Поема пройнята глибоким патріотичним змістом.

Поет говорить про несправедливість і труднощі, з якими зіштовхується український народ через історію, але водночас він звертає увагу на те, що боротьба і воля до свободи живуть у серцях людей, і ця боротьба не закінчиться, поки бажання жити вільною нацією веде народ вперед. Поема \\"І мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим...\\" є важливим документом, що відображає політичні й соціальні погляди Шевченка, його безмежну віру в силу українського народу перетворювати власну долю та бажання донести до них слово про необхідність боротьби за власні права та свободу."},{"prompt":"Конспект твору Т.Г Шевченка \\" І мертвим,і живим, і не народженим\\"","completion":"\\"І мертвим, і живим, і ненародженим...\\" є одним із найвідоміших творів Тараса Григоровича Шевченка, написаним 25 грудня 1845 року.

BSD label (Berkeley Software Distribution label) - это традиционный метод разметки разделов на диске, используемый в операционных системах семейства BSD (например, FreeBSD, OpenBSD). BSD label позволяет создавать и управлять до 8 разделами на диске. 2. GPT (GUID Partition Table) - более современный и универсальный метод разметки разделов, который используется во многих современных операционных системах, включая Windows, macOS и Linux. GPT позволяет создавать значительно большее количество разделов на диске (до 128) и поддерживает различные расширенные функции, такие как защита от потери данных и поддержка дисков объемом более 2 ТБ. Выбор между BSD label и GPT зависит от конкретных потребностей пользователя и требуемой совместимости с операционными системами.

Він написаний у 1845 році та є частиною більшого циклу віршів, присвячених Україні та її історії. # Ключові теми та ідеї: 1. **Звернення до різних поколінь**: - Поет звертається до трьох категорій українців: померлим, які пройшли життєвий шлях, живим, які продовжують боротьбу за волю, і майбутнім поколінням, яким має бути передано пам'ять і завдання продовження боротьби за незалежність. 2. **Пам'ять про минуле**: - Сильний акцент робиться на важливості історичної пам'яті, зв'язках між поколіннями та необхідності пам'ятати та шанувати боротьбу предків за волю України. 3. **Критика соціальної несправедливості**: - В творі відчувається глибока соціальна чутливість Шевченка, його критика кріпосницької системи, несправедливості та пригнічення українського народу. 4. **Надія та заклик до майбутнього**: - Твір закінчується оптимістично з вірою в світле майбутнє України, де воля та справедливість переможуть. Поет висловлює надію, що майбутні покоління будуть жити в свободі та злагоді. # Стиль та образи: Шевченко використовує багату символіку та метафорику, завдяки чому твір володіє глибокою емоційною виразністю. Мова поета багата та виразна, що дозволяє донести до читача всю глибину його почуттів та думок щодо долі України та її народу. # Важливість твору: Цей вірш є ключовим для розуміння ідеології та світогляду Тараса Шевченка. Він відбиває глибоке занепокоєння поета щодо майбутнього України, його безкомпромісну боротьбу за права та свободи українського народу.

To fix this, you can change your approach from using a \`NavLink\` for form submission (or actions like adding to cart) to a more appropriate handler such as a button with an \`onClick\` event. If navigation is required after adding to the cart, it can be handled programmatically within the \`onClick\` handler. Here's how you can adjust your current setup: 1. **Replace \`NavLink\` with a \`button\` element**: You can do this to ensure the click event for adding a product to the cart is handled correctly. 2. **Use \`history\` for navigation** (if necessary): If you need to navigate to a different route after adding to the cart, you can make use of the \`useHistory\` hook from \`react-router-dom\` for navigation instead of \`NavLink\`. Here's an adjusted version of your \\"Add To Cart\\" section: \`\`\`javascript import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom'; // Import useHistory const AddToCart = ({ product }) => { // Other existing code const history = useHistory(); // Initialize useHistory // Adjusted addToCart handler const handleAddToCart = () => { addToCart(id, color, amount, product); // Optionally navigate to another route // history.push('/cart'); // Navigate to cart page, for example toast({ title: 'Product Added', description: \`Product was successfully added to your cart.\`, status: 'success', duration: 3000, isClosable: true, }); }; return ( <Wrapper> {/* Existing code for rendering colors and cart amount toggle */} <Button className=\\"btn\\" onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add To Cart</Button> {/* Use Button with onClick */} </Wrapper> ); }; \`\`\` In this revised version: - The \`NavLink\` wrapping the \\"Add To Cart\\" button is replaced with a \`Button\` that has an \`onClick\` event listener pointing to the \`handleAddToCart\` function. This ensures the toast is correctly displayed when the button is clicked, and also allows you to programmatically handle adding the item to the cart. - The \`useEffect\` hook originally intended to show the toast every time the \`addToCart\` method changes is removed since it could lead to undesired toast notifications not directly related to user actions like clicking the \\"Add To Cart\\" button. Instead, call the \`toast\` directly in the \`handleAddToCart\` method, ensuring it's only shown when the method is executed. If navigating to another page is required after adding to the cart, use the \`history.push('/some-route')\` within the \`handleAddToCart\` method after the product has been added to the cart and the toast has been shown. This way, both the product addition and potential navigation are handled within the same function."},{"prompt":"How do i make the two files work together to theme the accordion: Accordion.ts: import { accordionAnatomy as parts } from \\"@chakra-ui/anatomy\\"; import { createMultiStyleConfigHelpers, defineStyle, } from \\"@chakra-ui/styled-system\\"; import { extendTheme } from \\"@chakra-ui/react\\"; const { definePartsStyle, defineMultiStyleConfig } = createMultiStyleConfigHelpers(parts.keys); // default base style from the Input theme const baseStyle = definePartsStyle({ container: defineStyle({ boxShadow: \\"sm\\", _focus: { boxShadow: \\"outline\\", }, }), }); // Defining a custom variant called outline const outline = definePartsStyle((props) => { const { colorScheme: c } = props; return { container: { border: \\"1px solid\\", borderColor: \\"gray.100\\", }, button: { color: \\"gray.500\\", _hover: { color: \\"gray.600\\", }, _focus: { color: \\"blue.500\\", }, fontFamily: \\"mono\\", }, }; }); const variants = { outline, }; const size = { md: defineStyle({ w: 5, h: 5, }), }; const sizes = { md: definePartsStyle({ icon: size.md, }), }; export const accordionTheme = defineMultiStyleConfig({ baseStyle, variants, sizes, defaultProps: { size: \\"md\\", variant: \\"outline\\", }, }); SinglePageFAQ.js: import React from 'react' import { Box, useColorMode, Accordion, AccordionButton, AccordionIcon, AccordionItem, AccordionPanel, IconButton, } from \\"@chakra-ui/react\\"; const SinglePageFAQ = () => { const { toggleColorMode, colorMode } = useColorMode(); return ( <div> <Box pt={12} position=\\"relative\\"> <Accordion> <AccordionItem m={4}> <h2> <AccordionButton > <Box flex=\\"1\\" textAlign=\\"left\\"> PRODUCT INFO </Box> <AccordionIcon /> </AccordionButton> </h2> <AccordionPanel pb={4}> Did you know that 1 Sukin Hydrating Mist Toner is sold every 40 seconds!?

This involves extending Chakra's default theme with your accordion theme and then providing this extended theme to your application via Chakra's \`ChakraProvider\`. This ensures the styled Accordion component gets its styles applied correctly when used within your app. Here’s how you can accomplish this: # Step 1: Extend Chakra's Default Theme Use the \`extendTheme\` function from Chakra UI to incorporate your custom \`accordionTheme\`. You usually do this in your main entry file, like \`index.js\` or \`App.js\`, depending on the structure of your project. Example in \`theme.js\`: \`\`\`javascript // Assuming Accordion.ts is exporting accordionTheme import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'; import { accordionTheme } from './path/to/Accordion'; // Update the path accordingly const theme = extendTheme({ components: { Accordion: accordionTheme, }, }); export default theme; \`\`\` # Step 2: Provide the Extended Theme to Your App Use the \`ChakraProvider\` at the root level of your application and pass the extended theme to it. This makes the theme available to all components in your app. Example in \`index.js\` or \`App.js\`: \`\`\`javascript import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'; import theme from './theme'; // The file where you have extended the theme import App from './App'; // Your main App component ReactDOM.render( <React.StrictMode> <ChakraProvider theme={theme}> <App /> </ChakraProvider> </React.StrictMode>, document.getElementById('root') ); \`\`\` # Step 3: Use Accordion in Your \`SinglePageFAQ\` Component Now, your \`SinglePageFAQ.js\` will automatically receive the custom styles defined in \`accordionTheme\` when you use \`Accordion\` and related components. No further changes are needed in \`SinglePageFAQ.js\` if it's only about applying styles. The component should now be styled according to the custom theme you defined. # Note: - Make sure the path to where you've defined your \`accordionTheme\` in the \`import\` statement in \`theme.js\` is correct. - This method of extending and providing a theme ensures all your Chakra UI components can be globally styled or tweaked from a single place, enhancing the consistency and maintainability of your app’s design. # Final Tips: - Always ensure the custom component keys (\`container\`, \`button\`, etc.) in your theme match those expected by Chakra UI's components. Refer to the Chakra UI documentation for more details on themeable component parts. - Test changes incrementally to catch any issues early, especially if integrating themes across multiple components or combining multiple custom themes."},{"prompt":"how do i increase the general fonts in the accordion to text-sm for mobile and text-base for desktop","completion":"To adjust font sizes for different screen sizes within the Chakra UI \`Accordion\` component, leveraging Chakra UI's responsive styles feature is the way to go. Chakra UI allows you to specify array values or object notation for responsive styling. This approach applies not only to the accordion component but to any stylable component within the Chakra UI ecosystem. Here’s how you can achieve this for your \`Accordion\` component's text content. # Step 1: Define Responsive Font Sizes in Your Theme or Component If your intention is to apply these font sizes across your application or specifically to all instances of the Accordion component, it's efficient to define these styles within your extended theme. These changes should occur where you define or extend your theme configurations. Updating the Theme for Accordion Globally \`\`\`javascript // In your theme.js or where you extend the Chakra theme import { extendTheme } from \\"@chakra-ui/react\\"; import { accordionTheme } from \\"./path/to/Accordion\\"; // Your existing accordion theme const theme = extendTheme({ components: { Accordion: { ...accordionTheme, // Assuming you have predefined styles you want to keep baseStyle: { ...accordionTheme.baseStyle, // Preserve existing baseStyles container: { ...accordionTheme.baseStyle?.container, // Responsive font setting using array syntax // 'sm' for mobile and 'md' for desktop as examples fontSize: [\\"sm\\", \\"md\\"], }, // If you want to target other parts specifically, you can do so as well panel: { ...accordionTheme.baseStyle?.panel, fontSize: [\\"sm\\", \\"md\\"], }, }, }, }, }); \`\`\` # Step 2: Apply the Theme Make sure you apply this theme using Chakra’s \`ChakraProvider\` as shown previously. This will ensure your responsive font sizes are applied globally to all Accordion components. # Responsive Styles Without Theme Modification If you prefer a more localized approach without modifying the global theme, you can directly apply responsive styles to the \`AccordionPanel\` or any other part of the Accordion in your component.

Since styled-components injects styles directly into the component, you cannot directly pass the image URL as a prop to the CSS. However, you can use CSS variables or inline styles as a workaround. Here’s how you can achieve this: # Step 1: Pass the Image URL as a Prop to the \`Wrapper\` Modify your \`Wrapper\` usage to accept an \`image\` prop, which you will then use as the background image for the wrapper. Additionally, to add an overlay, you'll layer backgrounds by first specifying a semi-transparent overlay color and then the image URL. \`\`\`jsx // Pass image prop to Wrapper return ( <Wrapper image={image}> // ...rest of your component </Wrapper> ); \`\`\` # Step 2: Update the \`Wrapper\` Styled Component You are going to adjust the \`Wrapper\` styled component to use the image URL from the props to set the background image, and also overlay it with a semi-transparent black background.

Depending on how your images are stored and accessed (e.g., locally in your project or hosted online), you might need to adjust how you handle the image path. # Also, consider the responsiveness: It's often a good idea to consider how your background images will behave on different screen sizes. The \`center/cover\` in the \`background\` shorthand ensures the image covers the entire area of the \`Wrapper\` without distorting its aspect ratio and centers it. This generally works well for responsiveness, but depending on your design, you might want to adjust or add media queries for better control over different screen sizes."},{"prompt":"correct the code: const Wrapper = styled.section<br/> // Existing styles<br/> <br/> // Adjust the background styles<br/> {(props) =&gt; background: /* Black overlay with 60% opacity / linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)), / URL of the background image */ url({props.image}) center/cover no-repeat; }<br/> <br/> // The rest of your styles<br/>;","completion":"It seems like you're trying to embed multi-line string literals within a styled component and utilize props to dynamically set a background image with an overlay.

Ensure that the \`props.image\` variable holds a valid URL or path to the image you wish to set as the background. If this variable comes from component props, its value needs to be correctly passed down from the parent component. Ensure that this \`Wrapper\` component is used within a React component where the \`image\` prop is properly passed, like so: \`\`\`jsx <Wrapper image=\\"path/to/your/image.jpg\\"> {/* Content goes here */} </Wrapper> \`\`\` This will apply your dynamic background image with a black overlay effectively."},{"prompt":"Hi there","completion":"Hello!

Вірш є одним з найяскравіших зразків громадянської поезії Шевченка, в якому він об'єднав болючі для себе теми - тему неволі, проблему відсутності національної свободи та гідності. У центрі цієї творчої роботи - потужне звернення до українців усіх поколінь: вже померлих, живих та ще не народжених. Шевченко закликає не забувати рідну мову, історію та культуру, берегти та примножувати національні традиції, боротися за свободу і незалежність своєї країни. Основні мотиви та ідеї твору: 1. **Зв'язок поколінь.** Шевченко акцентує на необхідності передачі знань і прагнень від одного покоління українців до іншого, щоб не дати загубитися істинам, за які боролися попередники. Цей мотив подає народ як єдине ціле, що об'єднує час і простір. 2. **Боротьба за волю.** Твір пронизаний мотивом боротьби за свободу. Шевченко вважає, що ця боротьба ніколи не повинна припинятися, доки українці повністю не отримають права на вільне життя у своїй країні. 3. **Мова як основа ідентичності.** Важливе місце в поемі займає заклик зберігати українську мову. Шевченко наголошує, що мова є ключовим елементом національної самобутності й самоідентифікації, і її забуття прирівнюється до втрати власної самості. 4. **Осуд неправди та зради.** Поет глибоко засуджує тих, хто зраджує національні ідеали, хто ігнорує або ж навмисно заперечує значення боротьби за волю і незалежність. 5. **Любов до України.** Любов до Батьківщини, туга за рідним краєм випромінюють з кожного рядка. Ця любов проявляється не в ідилічних описах, а в пекучому бажанні звільнити її від гніту, вболіванні за її долю. Закінчується твір оптимістичним поглядом у майбутнє, переконанням у перемозі добра, світла, віри в те, що Україна обов'язково встане з колін, вільною і незалежною. Це прояв віри поета у силу духу українського народу, у його незламність і велич майбутнього."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","completion":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"prompt":"Почему западная и восточная Украина сильно отличаются друг от друга?","completion":"Западная и восточная Украина отличаются друг от друга по ряду факторов: 1.

This era saw a significant evolution in the tactics and strategies employed by black South Africans and their allies in the struggle against apartheid. The resistance can broadly be categorized into non-violent and, later, more militant methods. **1. Non-Violent Resistance and Civil Disobedience:** Initially, the resistance efforts against apartheid laws were largely non-violent and rooted in civil disobedience, following the Gandhian philosophy. This form of protest was characterized by peaceful marches, strikes, and defying laws considered unjust. - **Defiance Campaign (1952):** Spearheaded by the African National Congress (ANC), the Defiance Campaign was one of the first major campaigns of civil disobedience against apartheid laws. Volunteers deliberately contravened laws such as curfew, pass laws, and segregation ordinances, willing to accept the consequences of arrest or imprisonment. Although the campaign resulted in harsh government crackdowns, it significantly boosted the morale and membership of the ANC. - **Freedom Charter (1955):** The Congress of the People, which included the ANC and allies from the Indian, Coloured, and white communities, adopted the Freedom Charter in Kliptown, Soweto. The charter called for a non-racial South Africa and outlined a vision for a democratic country where all races could live together as equals. This document became a symbol of resistance and a vision for post-apartheid South Africa. **2. Legal Challenges and International Advocacy:** Black South Africans and their supporters also utilized the courts to challenge apartheid laws and advocated for international sanctions against the South African regime. - **Court Challenges:** Although the legal system was stacked against them, black South Africans, often with the support of sympathetic lawyers, attempted to use the courts to challenge the most oppressive apartheid laws. - **International Advocacy:** The ANC and other organizations worked to bring the injustices of apartheid to the international stage, lobbying for economic sanctions, arms embargoes, and diplomatic isolation of the South African government. **3. Organizational Solidarity and Unity:** Black South Africans also fought against apartheid by building solidarity across racial and ethnic lines, forming alliances that cut across traditional barriers. - **The Congress Alliance:** This was a coalition including the ANC, South African Indian Congress, South African Coloured People's Organisation, and the Congress of Democrats (predominantly white members). This alliance showed a unified front against apartheid, emphasizing the struggle's multi-racial aspect. **4. Shift Towards Militant Resistance:** Following the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, where 69 protestors were killed by police during a peaceful demonstration against the pass laws, the strategy of non-violent resistance began to be questioned more broadly. - **Formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK):** In response to the massacre and the subsequent banning of the ANC and other anti-apartheid organizations, a militant wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), was founded in 1961 by Nelson Mandela and others. MK commenced a campaign of sabotage against government installations and infrastructure, marking a significant shift towards armed resistance. **Conclusion:** The resistance against apartheid between 1948 and 1964 was multifaceted, initially dominated by non-violent protests, civil disobedience, and legal challenges against the repressive laws. However, the unyielding brutality of the apartheid regime, highlighted by events such as the Sharpeville Massacre, led to a strategic shift among some sections of the resistance towards armed struggle and sabotage. This period laid the foundations for the intensified struggle against apartheid that would continue until its eventual dismantling in the early 1990s."},{"prompt":"Lusitania - propoganda - Fourteen Points - self-determination - armistice - pandemic - reparation - mandate -","completion":"These terms are associated with World War I and its aftermath. Let's go through each one for a brief explanation: 1. **Lusitania**: The Lusitania was a British ocean liner that was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915. This event killed 1,198 people, including 128 Americans, and played a significant role in turning public opinion in neutral countries against Germany, eventually influencing the United States to enter World War I in 1917. 2. **Propaganda**: Propaganda refers to information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view. During World War I, all nations involved used propaganda extensively to maintain support for their cause, recruit soldiers, and demonize the enemy. 3. **Fourteen Points**: The Fourteen Points were a statement of principles for peace that was to be used for peace negotiations in order to end World War I. These points were outlined by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in January 1918. The principles included open covenants of peace, freedom of the seas, free trade, and the self-determination of peoples, among others. 4. **Self-determination**: Self-determination is the principle that peoples have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. Wilson's Fourteen Points strongly advocated for this concept, particularly in the context of redrawing borders and establishing new nations from the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires. 5. **Armistice**: An armistice is a formal agreement of warring parties to stop fighting. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 ended fighting on land, sea, and air in World War I between the Allies and their last opponent, Germany. This is commemorated as Armistice Day or Remembrance Day in many countries. 6. **Pandemic**: In the context of World War I, the term \\"pandemic\\" is often associated with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919. This influenza pandemic infected an estimated one-third of the world's population and resulted in the deaths of at least 50 million people worldwide. The close quarters of the troops and widespread global movement contributed to its spread. 7. **Reparation**: Reparations refer to the compensation paid by a defeated country for the damage or injury it inflicted during a war. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) imposed harsh reparations on Germany, demanding that it accept responsibility for causing the war and pay huge sums for damages and reconstruction. 8. **Mandate**: Following World War I, certain territories, primarily former colonies and territories of the defeated Central Powers, were administered by League of Nations mandates. The mandate system was a compromise between those who advocated for the annexation of the territories by the victors and those who supported the principle of self-determination for all populations. Mandate territories were governed by a member of the League of Nations until they were deemed capable of self-government."},{"prompt":"1. Why did the European nations form opposing alliances? 2.

How did the refusal of the US to join the League of NAtions weaken the Leagues Power?","completion":"1. **Why did the European nations form opposing alliances?** European nations formed opposing alliances mainly as a means of balancing power and deterring aggression. The rise of Germany as a powerful nation-state following its unification in 1871 and the pre-existing tensions among older powers like France and Britain led to a complex web of alliances aimed at maintaining the balance of power. The two main alliances were the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). These alliances were meant to provide a measure of security, as an attack on one member would mean conflict with all, theoretically deterring potential aggressors. However, these alliances ended up binding the signatories to support each other, leading to the widespread escalation of regional conflicts into larger wars. 2. **How did Austria's alliance system influence Austria's decision to send Serbia an ultimatum?** Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany significantly influenced its decision to send Serbia an ultimatum following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. Confident in Germany's support (sometimes referred to as the \\"blank check\\" assurance), Austria-Hungary felt emboldened to confront Serbia with harsh demands, hoping either to weaken Serbia as a regional adversary or to go to war with the backing of German military might. This ultimatum, with demands intentionally made unacceptable, set the stage for Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia, which in turn activated the network of alliances leading to World War I. 3. **How did Germany's Invasion of Belgium bring Britain into the war?** Germany's invasion of Belgium in 1914 was a key factor that brought Britain into World War I. The invasion was part of the Schlieffen Plan, which aimed to quickly defeat France by moving through Belgium. Belgium's neutrality had been guaranteed by the Treaty of London (1839), to which Britain was a signatory. The violation of Belgian neutrality provided the British government with the casus belli needed to enter the war against Germany. Public and political opinion in Britain was strongly in favor of defending Belgium, and thus, Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914. 4. **What is trench warfare?** Trench warfare is a form of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of military trenches, in which troops are well-protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. This form of warfare became emblematic of World War I, especially on the Western Front. It was characterized by long periods of stalemate, with neither side able to secure a decisive breakthrough, while soldiers faced horrific conditions, including flooding, mud, disease, and the constant threat of enemy assault. 5. **Describe the Schlieffen Plan.** The Schlieffen Plan was a strategic plan devised by German Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen in the early 20th century. The plan was designed to avoid a two-front war against France in the west and Russia in the east by quickly defeating France within six weeks through a rapid invasion via Belgium and Luxembourg. After France was defeated, German forces would then be redeployed to the east to face Russia, which was expected to take longer to mobilize. The plan failed primarily because of stiff Belgian resistance, the unexpected speed of Russian mobilization, and the entrance of Britain into the war. 6. **What is a stalemate, and why did one develop on the Western Front?** A stalemate is a situation in warfare where neither side can achieve a decisive victory or advance against the enemy, often resulting in a deadlock. On the Western Front, a stalemate developed due to the effective use of defensive positions, notably trench warfare, which made it difficult for either side to achieve a breakout without incurring massive casualties. The introduction of new technology, like machine guns and barbed wire, further enhanced defensive capabilities. This, combined with the failure of offensive strategies to achieve rapid victories, led to a prolonged and grueling deadlock that lasted for much of the war. 7. **Why did President Wilson think that World War I was \\"the war to end wars\\"?** President Woodrow Wilson viewed World War I as \\"the war to end all wars\\" because he believed that through this great conflict, the world could eliminate the causes of war, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalist rivalries, and establish a lasting peace. He hoped the war would lead to a transformation in international relations, resulting in a world where democracy and self-determination would prevail, removing the motivations for future conflicts. This idealistic vision was part of his rationale for the League of Nations, an international organization aimed at ensuring collective security and preventing future wars. 8. **How did the refusal of the US to join the League of Nations weaken the League's power?** The refusal of the United States to join the League of Nations significantly weakened the organization's power and effectiveness. As one of the world's leading economic and military powers, the U.S. was envisioned to play a leading role in enforcing the League's decisions and providing the necessary support for its initiatives. Without U.S. participation, the League lacked the necessary clout and resources to effectively manage international disputes, enforce sanctions, or deter aggression by member states. This absence undermined the League's authority and its ability to prevent future conflicts, exemplified by its powerlessness in the face of aggression leading up to World War II."},{"prompt":"Make the answers short 1.

Sweeney is involved because the robberies were violent, putting shop staff in hospital...","completion":"Title: \\"Barking Up the Wrong Tree\\" Opening Scene: The camera pans across the bustling streets of London, finally resting on a small, quaint pet shop in the East End. Suddenly, the tranquility is shattered by the crashing sound of glass breaking. Masked robbers ransack the shop, leaving behind a trail of chaos and injured staff. Cut to: Detective Inspector (DI) Jack Regan and Detective Sergeant (DS) George Carter arrive at the scene, their Ford Granada screeching to a halt. They are met with a sight of police cars and ambulances, the blue lights casting an eerie glow on their faces. Regan, ever the gruff and action-ready officer, steps out of the car, his face a mask of irritation. \\"What's all this, then? A pet shop?\\" he barks at a uniformed officer. \\"Yes, sir. Third one this month,\\" the officer replies, hands nervously adjusting his cap. Carter, the more thoughtful of the duo, joins Regan, a puzzled expression on his face. \\"Seems a bit odd, doesn't it, guv? Robbing a pet shop?\\" As they step into the chaos inside, Regan and Carter quickly realize that this is no ordinary robbery. The pet shops all belong to a known 'Mr Big', a well-known figure in the London underworld, and there's talk among the streets that these robberies serve a darker purpose - an insurance scam. Act One: Regan and Carter dig deeper, their investigation leading them through the grimy underbelly of London, from shady pet suppliers to disgruntled former employees. Their journey is interspersed with fast-paced car chases and the occasional pub brawl, the Sweeney team's trademark methods of extracting information. The detectives find a connection in the form of a shadowy figure known only as \\"The Handler\\", a middleman for Mr Big, known for his violent tactics and love for exotic animals. It becomes clear these robberies were a front, designed to claim insurance on valuable exotic pets supposedly 'stolen' in the raids. However, things take a turn for the complicated when they learn that The Handler has gone rogue, unsatisfied with his share of the spoils. He's planning a final heist, one that would leave Mr Big's operation in ruins and line his pockets with a fortune. Act Two: The climax builds as Regan and Carter race against time to stop The Handler. Their pursuit leads them to a warehouse on the docks, the scene set for a final showdown as the Thames laps ominously against the jetty. Gunfire exchanges, punches thrown, and in true Sweeney style, the pair manage to apprehend The Handler amidst a cage of squawking exotic birds and caged animals. Mr Big arrives, furious at the betrayal, but is met with the cold hand of the law as Regan delivers one of his iconic catchphrases. Conclusion: With The Handler and Mr Big in custody, the pet shop crime spree comes to an end. London's East End can breathe a little easier, knowing the Sweeney is on the case. Regan and Carter stand outside the recovered pet shop, a sense of satisfaction between them. \\"Bit of a wild goose chase, that one,\\" Carter quips, lighting a cigarette. Regan chuckles, clapping his partner on the back. \\"Yeah, but we weren't barking up the wrong tree, were we?\\" As they walk back to their Granada, the screen fades to black, the iconic 70s theme tune playing them out.

The Sweeny's been tracking a series of raids on Post Office's , but the notes stolen were recovered in Belfast....","completion":"Title: \\"Across the Lines\\" Opening Scene: The iconic theme of The Sweeney fills the air as the opening credits roll to a close. A night-draped London serves as a backdrop, with the camera zooming into a dimly lit meeting room within the Metropolitan Police headquarters. Sitting at a long mahogany table are Detective Inspector Jack Regan, his frequent partner Detective Sergeant George Carter, their boss Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins, and a stern-faced Chief Superintendent from Special Branch, Charles Redmond. The tension in the room is palpable as Chief Superintendent Redmond outlines the purpose of the late-night conference. \\"Gentlemen,\\" he begins, \\"we've been monitoring a series of raids on Post Offices across London. Initially, these appeared to be run-of-the-mill burglaries, but there's a twist—the stolen banknotes have resurfaced in Belfast.\\" DI Regan leans forward, intrigued but visibly irked at being pulled into what he initially perceives as a jurisdictional quagmire. \\"So, what's this got to do with the Flying Squad then?\\" he asks bluntly, wary of stepping on Special Branch's toes. Redmond clears his throat, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. \\"Intelligence suggests that the robberies are not merely for financial gain. They're funding operations for a dangerous faction involved in the Troubles. This makes it a matter of national security.\\" Act One: The episode ramps up as Regan and Carter are briefed on their next moves. They're to work in tandem with Special Branch, a partnership neither of them is particularly thrilled about, to unravel the network behind the Post Office raids. Their investigation leads them into a murky underworld of political extremism, where the stakes are higher than any ordinary crime spree. Carter's analytical mind and Regan's gut instincts guide them through a labyrinth of informants, dead drops, and secret meetings. A breakthrough comes when Regan, employing his unorthodox methods, manages to sweet-talk a small-time criminal with connections to the faction responsible for the robberies. The information leads them to a seemingly innocuous pub on the outskirts of London—a front for the operation funneling money to Belfast. Act Two: As the plot thickens, the episode takes on a darker tone. The team stages a daring undercover operation to infiltrate a handover of stolen notes, planning to trace them back to the higher-ups in the operation. Carter, backed by Regan, plays the part of a rogue buyer, his life on the line if their cover is blown. The tension reaches a peak as a violent confrontation ensues during the handover. Regan and Carter, with support from a Special Branch tactical team, manage to thwart the transaction, but not without cost. In the aftermath, they unearth documents pointing to a planned bombing in London, intended to be funded by the stolen notes. Conclusion: The episode climaxes with a high-stakes race against time to prevent the bombing, leading to a nail-biting conclusion near London's Tower Bridge. The combined efforts of the Sweeney and Special Branch neutralize the threat, saving countless lives. In the debrief, back at the dimly lit meeting room, thanks are exchanged reluctantly between Regan and Redmond. The episode closes on a contemplative note, with Regan and Carter looking out over the Thames, reflecting on the intertwined worlds of crime and political extremism. Regan lights a cigarette, offering one to Carter. \\"You know, George, sometimes it's not just about catching crooks,\\" he muses. Carter nods, taking a drag. \\"Yeah, Guv. But at the end of the day, it's all part of the job, isn't it?\\" The screen fades to black, ending with the echoes of The Sweeney's theme, marking the end of another gritty, complex episode."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Episode of the Sweeney - Regan's thinking it would be a quiet day.

Inside the dimly lit Flying Squad office, Detective Inspector Jack Regan is found feet up on the desk, sipping his morning brew, enjoying what he thought would be a slow day. DS George Carter is flipping through a newspaper, both relishing the rare quiet. Carter cracks a joke about hoping for a day without chases or gunfire, but their moment of peace is shattered by the shrill ring of the telephone. Regan, with a resigned sigh, picks up the receiver. \\"Regan,\\" he barks into the phone. His face tenses as he listens. Cut to: The London Transport Lost Property Office, a chaotic crime scene. Uniformed officers are taping off the area as Regan and Carter arrive. The officer in charge briefs them: An armed gang executed a precision raid that morning, but bizarrely, only three specific briefcases were taken—items recently lost and reported by a highly regarded Temple Barrister known for his involvement in high-profile cases. Act One: The plot thickens as Regan and Carter delve into the barrister's life, uncovering a web of corruption, blackmail, and the suggestion that the barrister might be manipulating trial outcomes. The stolen briefcases, they learn, contain sensitive information that could not only compromise ongoing cases but potentially incriminate the barrister in unethical, if not illegal, activities. Our detectives' investigation leads them through the murky depths of the legal world, confronting them with a side of justice they seldom see. From interviewing wary clerks who knew too much to confronting the barrister himself, who's as slippery as they come, the pair navigate the fine line between legal confidentiality and their quest for truth. Act Two: Through a blend of cunning, bravery, and their trademark disregard for authority, Regan and Carter trace the gang's next move. They uncover a network that trades in stolen information, revealing how the briefcases were targeted to derail a major trial in exchange for a hefty payout. The climax sees our heroes staging a risky sting operation to recover the briefcases and capture the gang. In a heart-stopping sequence set in an underground parking lot, the Sweeney team, guns drawn, faces off against the gang. The operation is almost compromised when the barrister unexpectedly shows up, attempting to retrieve the briefcases for himself. Conclusion: In the aftermath of the shootout, with the gang apprehended and the briefcases recovered, the barrister is arrested, his reputation in tatters. Back at the office, Regan and Carter, paperwork sprawled in front of them, reflect on the day's events. Regan, with a wry smile, notes, \\"Just when you think you've seen it all, eh, Carter?\\" Carter, shaking his head, responds, \\"In our line of work, Guv, there's no such thing as a quiet day.\\" The episode closes with the duo heading out for a well-deserved pint, leaving behind the day's pandemonium.

The Flytippers twig and run, but they drop a wallet, which contains notes traceable to a 'bank' heist a year previously... Carter has to convince the local Commander to unroll the carpet, revealing the lead suspect...","completion":"Title: \\"Under Wraps\\" Opening Scene: Detective Sergeant George Carter, in plain clothes, is enjoying a rare day off, taking in the tranquility of Epping Forest. The camera follows him as he walks along one of its many winding paths, trying to shake off the city's hustle and bustle. Suddenly, his attention is caught by a van parked in an isolated clearing. He watches, puzzled, as two men hastily unload a bulky, carpet-wrapped object. Sensing something amiss, Carter reaches for his camera, but before he can act, the men spot him. Panic ensues, and the fly-tippers make a quick getaway, abandoning their suspicious cargo, but in their hurry, a wallet falls to the ground. Act One: Carter, driven by instinct, inspects the wallet. Among various IDs and a small amount of cash, he finds several notes with peculiar markings – ones he recognizes from a briefing on a high-stakes bank heist that occurred a year prior. The case had gone cold with the main suspect never found. Carter immediately calls DI Jack Regan, but with signal issues in the forest, he knows he needs to act fast. He decides to approach the local police station in Epping. Upon arrival, Carter tries convincing the skeptical local Commander, DCI Thompson, that the carpet might hide significant evidence or even the missing suspect related to the heist. Thompson, mindful of jurisdiction and not wanting a metropolitan detective stirring trouble, resists. But Carter, using his wit and dropping Haskins' name, finally persuades him to inspect the carpet. Act Two: With the local force on board, they carefully unroll the carpet in a secure location, revealing not the suspect but a meticulously crafted mannequin made to look like him, complete with fake blood and a staged gunshot wound. Puzzled but undeterred, Carter theorizes this must be a message from the heist's orchestrator – perhaps the suspect double-crossed someone and is now in hiding. The plot thickens as Carter, with reluctantly granted authority by Thompson, leads a joint investigation that uncovers a trail leading to a notorious yet elusive criminal family known for their ruthless control over London's underground. They realize the family might be sheltering the suspect, using him for their gain. As Carter and the local team delve deeper, they encounter various challenges, from veiled threats to uncooperative witnesses, all fearful of the family's wrath. The investigation takes a dangerous turn when an informant, initially willing to talk, suddenly retracts, hinting at deadly consequences. Conclusion: The tension culminates with an audacious daytime raid on the criminal family's secluded estate, orchestrated by Carter and supported by both the Metropolitan Police and the local force. In a heart-pounding sequence, they discover not only the carpet's unsettling message but also hard evidence linking the family to the heist and other crimes. The episode climaxes with the return of Regan, who arrives just in time to assist in the critical arrest, and a significant breakthrough regarding the heist's missing suspect, now ready to turn state's evidence against the criminal family for protection. Back at the Epping station, with the case unraveling and the criminal network starting to collapse, Carter and Thompson share a grudging respect for each other's methods. Carter, grateful for the local team's support, heads back to London, ready to face Regan's inevitable ribbing for \\"never being able to take a day off.\\" As the episode draws to a close, the camera pans out from the station, capturing the tranquility of Epping Forest once more, juxtaposing the chaotic world Carter momentarily brought to its doorstep, with the iconic theme music signaling the end of another gripping Sweeney adventure."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Episode of the Sweeney - Opening: A Van carrying bottles is attacked, and the crates moved to another van..

Inside, crates of what seem to be high-end spirit bottles glisten under the dim lights. Suddenly, another van blocks its path. Masked figures brandishing clubs leap out, smashing windows and overpowering the driver. Swiftly, they transfer the crates to their vehicle and disappear into the morning fog. The title sequence rolls to the iconic theme of The Sweeney. Cut to: Detective Inspector Jack Regan receives a call from one of his most reliable informants, a young woman named Lilly. She nervously recounts a recent encounter with a small-time crook, Danny Parsons, who had been flaunting his recent 'earnings'. After sharing a drink from a bottle he obtained from a charismatic seller peddling ‘exclusive’ spirits under the counter, Parsons collapsed, barely surviving what was supposed to be a celebratory drink. Regan, initially dismissive - bootleg spirits not being high on The Sweeney's list of priorities - senses something amiss. Remembering the morning's unusual van attack, he starts to connect the dots: what if these weren't just any spirits but something much more valuable or dangerous? Act One: The investigation kicks off when Regan, accompanied by DS George Carter, visits Parsons in the hospital. Barely coherent but sufficiently scared, Parsons whispers about the 'gentleman' who sold him the bottle – a known fence with connections far above his usual paygrade. Intrigued, Regan orders surveillance on the fence, suspecting that the spirited away bottles might be a front for something far more sinister than simple alcohol smuggling. Further probing leads them to a clandestine distillery operating from an abandoned warehouse: but this is no ordinary bootleg operation. They discover that the 'spirits' are a cocktail of stolen pharmaceuticals, dangerously potent and highly illegal. Act Two: Regan and Carter's pursuit becomes a race against time when they learn of a planned 'tasting event' for London's underworld, where these lethal blends are to be introduced en masse. Infiltrating the gathering, Carter plays the part of an interested buyer, his life on the line if his cover is blown. The climactic scene unfolds at the event, where Regan, Carter, and their backup narrowly avert a disaster by swooping in on the attendees just as the deals begin. In the melee, the enigmatic figure behind the operation tries to slip away, leading to a gripping chase. Conclusion: The episode culminates back at the Scotland Yard, with the mastermind—a former pharmacist turned underworld alchemist—under arrest, and the perilous spirits confiscated. It's a victory, but the mood is somber as Regan reflects on the potential disaster they just barely avoided. Carter, nursing a bruised arm but with his humor intact, quips, \\"All that fuss over a bit of booze, eh, guv?\\" Regan, allowing himself a small smile, retorts, \\"Next time you fancy a drink, Carter, stick to the pub, yeah?\\" As they leave the confines of the Yard, the screen fades to the bustling streets of London, the iconic theme music playing out as the credits roll, marking the end of a case that was anything but ordinary for the men of The Sweeney."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Episode of the Sweeney - \\"Charisma\\" - Regan gets handed a flyer for a 'personality-test' by a male dressed like a Junior Naval Officer..

Amid the urban hustle, he's stopped by a young man clad in an immaculate Junior Naval Officer outfit, complete with shining buttons and cap. This 'officer' eagerly hands over a flyer promoting a 'personality test' guaranteed to change lives. Regan, with a wary glance and a few choice words about having a personality that suits him just fine, dismisses the encounter. However, something about the young man's urgent demeanor sticks with him as he strides away. Cut to: Detective Sergeant George Carter is deep undercover, following up on a tip from a distressed 'Mr. Big', whose world of crime he wishes to keep away from his family. The latest rumor - his daughter, Sophie, has been snatched by a rival gang. Their demand: Mr. Big's participation in a high-stakes robbery. Carter, seeing an opportunity to infiltrate deeper into the criminal network, decides to use this lead to draw closer to the rival gang's operations. Act One: Through Carter's undercover work, he discovers a connection between Sophie and the young 'naval officer', who is revealed not to be a serviceman but a high-ranking member of an emerging cult. This cult, led by an enigmatic and charming figure known only as 'The Charismatic', has been luring young, vulnerable individuals, promising them enlightenment and collective belonging in exchange for their devotion - and financial contributions. Sophie, isolated from her father's criminal empire and seeking solace, finds herself entangled with 'The Charismatic' through her romantic link with the 'naval officer', real name Alex. Carter relays this information to Regan, and they both realize the cult's influence is spreading dangerously close to their sphere. Act Two: The investigation heats up as Regan and Carter uncover 'The Charismatic's' true intentions: to amass wealth and power by exploiting his followers’ connections to London's criminal underworld. Sophie’s abduction is revealed to be a scheme to coerce Mr. Big into funding the cult's expansion under the guise of a ransom. Regan, using his street smarts, and Carter, leveraging his undercover role, devise a plan to infiltrate the cult's next grand meeting - a publicity stunt masquerading as a spiritual awakening event.

The climax unfolds as Regan confronts 'The Charismatic' mid-speech, publicly exposing his manipulations and criminal activities. In the ensuing chaos, the cult's structure begins to crumble as followers doubt and law enforcement closes in. Conclusion: Sophie is safely reunited with her father, who, while no saint, expresses genuine relief and gratitude towards Regan and Carter. Alex, torn between his devotion to 'The Charismatic' and his love for Sophie, ultimately cooperates with the police, providing crucial information to help dismantle the cult further. Regan and Carter, back at the pub for a debrief, reflect on the case's complexities, acknowledging the dangerous allure of charismatic figures when individuals seek meaning or escape. \\"Charisma,\\" Regan muses, swirling his drink, \\"can be just as lethal as a bullet in the wrong hands.\\" As they raise a toast to another case closed, the camera pans out, leaving the audience to ponder the fine line between faith and fanaticism, underpinned by the gritty realities of The Sweeney's London, with the iconic theme music drawing the episode to an end."},{"prompt":"Какая страна славится своей высококачественной и дорогой обувью?","completion":"Италия славится своей высококачественной и дорогой обувью.

Here is an updated version of the \`load_conversations_from_json\` function and a new function to append knowledge to the context. This example assumes you want to append all knowledge base entries to each context as a simple demonstration. In practical applications, you'd want to selectively append relevant information based on the context or the question asked by the user. \`\`\`python def load_conversations_from_json(json_data, knowledge_base=None): ''' If a knowledge base (dict) is provided, it appends related knowledge to the context.

This involves loading and parsing this live data within your model application, making decisions or inferences based on its content, and possibly including relevant details in the responses generated by your model. Here's a conceptual approach to achieve this within the context of your current setup, focusing on how you might load and use the \`live-datasource.json\` at runtime: # 1. Load the Live Data First, load your \`live-datasource.json\` alongside your model, ensuring it’s accessible when the model is generating responses. You can do this whenever you receive a new query/request, or you can preload it if the data does not change frequently. \`\`\`python def load_live_data(file_path): with open(file_path, 'r') as file: live_data = json.load(file) return live_data # Example of loading live data live_data_path = '/content/live-datasource.json' live_data = load_live_data(live_data_path) \`\`\` # 2. Query the Live Data Next, depending on your requirements, create functions that query this live data to find relevant information. This could involve, for example, finding transactions by date, by merchant, whether they were authorized with 2FA, etc. \`\`\`python def find_transactions_by_merchant(live_data, merchant_name): results = [transaction for transaction in live_data if transaction[\\"merchant\\"].lower() == merchant_name.lower()] return results \`\`\` # 3. Integrate Live Data into Your Response Generation When generating responses, query the live data based on the context of the conversation and append any relevant information to the model's input, similar to how you're handling the knowledge base. Assuming you have a request that necessitates fetching data from this live data source (e.g., a question about transactions from a specific merchant), you could modify your \`append_knowledge_to_context\` or create a similar function that conditionally integrates live data: \`\`\`python def append_relevant_data(context, live_data): # Example assumes 'context' might contain a merchant name # This is simplistic — a more complex implementation would be needed for real applications merchant_names = [\\"Nike\\", \\"Adidas\\"] # Extend based on your needs or dynamically extract merchants from \`live_data\` for merchant in merchant_names: if merchant.lower() in context.lower(): transactions = find_transactions_by_merchant(live_data, merchant) if transactions: transaction_details = \\" \\".join([f\\"- Transaction ID {t['transaction_id']} on {t['date']} for amount {t['amount']}\\" for t in transactions]) context += f\\" [LiveData] {transaction_details}\\" return context \`\`\` Remember, this approach is simplified and would need to be made more robust and dynamic based on your actual use case, such as dynamically identifying relevant merchants or transaction details from the context. # 4. Adjust Your Model Inference When you're ready to generate a response during runtime, you'll follow a similar process to include the live data: \`\`\`python # Just before generating the response context, _ = load_conversations_from_json(data) # Assuming this is how you're getting your context context_with_live_info = append_relevant_data(context[0], live_data) # Example for the first context # Then proceed to generate your response using the model \`\`\` This process lets your model use additional 'live' data dynamically at runtime, enhancing its responses based on real-world, current information in \`live-datasource.json\`.

The primary idea is to append contextually relevant information from the knowledge base to the conversation's context so that the model can generate more informed responses. Given the specific use case and example you provided, I'll guide how to modify your existing code to incorporate the knowledge base into the dataset preparation and model inference phases. This process won't directly train the model on the knowledge base content; instead, it will utilize the knowledge base at runtime to augment the data fed into the model, potentially making the generated responses more relevant and informed. 1. **Define the Knowledge Base**: Your knowledge base is simply defined, but it needs to be in a format easily appendable to the context based on specific triggers or conditions. In this case, let's assume the knowledge base will be checked for every conversation to see if it includes topics that could relate to it (like \\"chargeback\\"). 2. **Modify Data Preparation**: You will adjust the data preparation steps to include relevant knowledge from the knowledge base into the context wherever applicable. Here's how you can modify your code to implement the above steps: # Step 1: Integrating the Knowledge Base Suppose you have your knowledge base defined as follows: \`\`\`python knowledge_base = { \\"Chargeback\\": [ \\"Chargebacks beyond 90 days are not possible.\\", \\"Chargebacks above 1000 are not allowed\\", \\"Chargebacks for transactions with a valid 3D secure are not allowed\\" ] } \`\`\` # Step 2: Modifying the Context Preparation Next, modify your dataset preparation to append information from the knowledge base to the context if it's relevant. First, let’s define a function to check if the context should have the knowledge appended: \`\`\`python def append_knowledge(context, keywords, knowledge_base): # A simple example that appends all knowledge base information if a keyword is found for keyword in keywords: if keyword.lower() in context.lower(): # Case insensitive check # Append all chargeback related knowledge for info in knowledge_base[\\"Chargeback\\"]: context += f\\" {info}\\" break return context \`\`\` Then, change the \`load_conversations_from_json\` function to use this method to append knowledge based on the context. In your current setup, you might have to adjust where and how the context is formed in the \`myDataset\` class or before dataset construction. Here’s a simplified way to include it in your data preparation step before initializing the \`myDataset\` instances: \`\`\`python # Simulate finding relevant context keywords for demonstration relevant_keywords = [\\"chargeback\\", \\"transaction\\"] # Adjusting contexts with knowledge base information context_train = [append_knowledge(context, relevant_keywords, knowledge_base) for context in context_train] context_val = [append_knowledge(context, relevant_keywords, knowledge_base) for context in context_val] # Proceed with creating dictionaries and datasets as you’ve done before \`\`\` This is a fundamental way to achieve the integration at runtime. The \`append_knowledge\` function is basic and might append knowledge too frequently or not accurately enough. The actual implementation should be more sophisticated, potentially using NLP techniques to understand the context better and match the relevant parts of the knowledge base more accurately. Remember, this approach dynamically includes knowledge at runtime, allowing the agent to use live data or a dynamically changing knowledge base to inform its responses better. It’s still essential to test and refine how and when knowledge is appended to ensure it benefits the model's performance and relevance in generating responses."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
