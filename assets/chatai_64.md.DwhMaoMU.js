We need to find the maximum value of ( c ) such that: [ {n sqrt{2}} geq frac{c}{n} quad forall n in mathbb{N} ] 3. Let ( lfloor n sqrt{2} rfloor = m ). Then: [ n sqrt{2} = m + {n sqrt{2}} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ 2n^2 = m^2 + 2m {n sqrt{2}} + {n sqrt{2}}^2 ] 4. Rearranging, we have: [ 2n^2 - m^2 = 2m {n sqrt{2}} + {n sqrt{2}}^2 ] Since ( 0 leq {n sqrt{2}} < 1 ), we can approximate: [ 2n^2 - m^2 approx 2m {n sqrt{2}} ] 5. For large ( n ), the term ( {n sqrt{2}} ) is small, so we can approximate further: [ 2n^2 - m^2 approx 2m {n sqrt{2}} ] This implies: [ {n sqrt{2}} approx frac{2n^2 - m^2}{2m} ] 6. We know that ( m approx n sqrt{2} ), so: [ {n sqrt{2}} approx frac{2n^2 - (n sqrt{2})^2}{2n sqrt{2}} = frac{2n^2 - 2n^2}{2n sqrt{2}} = 0 ] This approximation is too crude, so we need a more precise approach. 7.

For these convergents, we have: [ left| sqrt{2} - frac{p_k}{q_k} right| < frac{1}{q_k^2} ] This implies: [ left| n sqrt{2} - m right| < frac{1}{n} ] where ( m = lfloor n sqrt{2} rfloor ). 8.

However, this interpretation is misleading. While f represents the frequency, or the number of times an event occurs, it does not necessarily keep increasing indefinitely as more experiments are conducted. Instead, f is expected to oscillate around a certain value as the number of experiments increases. B: This option suggests that both f and P may change. However, P, the probability of the event, is a theoretical value that does not change with the number of experiments. It is a constant for a given event under the same conditions. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. C: This option states that the more experiments conducted, the closer f gets to P.

Mastering the theorems and formulas is key to solving this problem, which is considered to be of medium difficulty. By using the basic relationships between trigonometric functions of the same angle, we simplify the left side of the given equation. Using the sine theorem, we simplify the right side of the given equation. After rearranging and using the sine function formulas for the sum and difference of two angles and the induction formula, and considering that sin C neq 0, we can find the value of cos A.

The toll for an 18wheel truck that has 2 wheels on its front axle and 4 wheels on each of its other axles is 6. What is the constant in the formula?","completion":"First, we need to determine the number of axles on the 18-wheel truck. Since the truck has 2 wheels on its front axle and 4 wheels on each of its other axles, we can calculate the number of axles by dividing the total number of wheels by the number of wheels per axle. The front axle has 2 wheels, so that's 1 axle. The remaining 16 wheels must be on axles with 4 wheels each. So, we divide 16 by 4 to find the number of these axles: 16 wheels / 4 wheels per axle = 4 axles Adding the front axle, the truck has a total of 1 + 4 = 5 axles. Now, we can use the given formula for the toll t: t = constant + 1.50(x - 2) We know that the toll t is 6 and x, the number of axles, is 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: 6 = constant + 1.50(5 - 2) Now, calculate the value inside the parentheses: 5 - 2 = 3 So, the formula becomes: 6 = constant + 1.50(3) Now, multiply 1.50 by 3: 1.50 * 3 = 4.50 So, the formula is now: 6 = constant + 4.50 To find the constant, we subtract 4.50 from both sides of the equation: 6 - 4.50 = constant 1.50 = constant Therefore, the constant in the formula is boxed{1.50} ."},{"prompt":"f the graph of a linear function passing through the point left(2,2right) intersects with the linear function y=x+3left(0leqslant xleqslant 3right), then the range of values for k is ____.","completion":"To solve for the range of values for k in the given problem, we follow these steps: 1. **Given Information**: We are given a linear function y=kx+b that passes through the point (2,2) and intersects with the linear function y=-x+3 within the domain 0leqslant xleqslant 3. 2. **Intersection Points with Axes for y=-x+3**: The given linear function intersects the coordinate axes at (0,3) and (3,0). 3. **Case 1 - Passing Through (2,2) and (0,3)**: - From the point (2,2), we have 2k+b=2. - From the point (0,3), we have b=3. - Solving this system of equations, we substitute b=3 into 2k+b=2 to get 2k+3=2, leading to 2k=-1, and thus k=-frac{1}{2}. 4. **Case 2 - Passing Through (2,2) and (3,0)**: - Again, from the point (2,2), we have 2k+b=2. - From the point (3,0), we have 3k+b=0. - Solving this system of equations, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b, getting -k=2, and thus k=-2. 5. **Combining the Results**: - From the two cases, we have found that k can be -frac{1}{2} when passing through (2,2) and (0,3), and k can be -2 when passing through (2,2) and (3,0). - Therefore, the range of values for k is such that kleqslant -2 or kgeqslant -frac{1}{2}, considering the linear function must intersect with y=-x+3 within the given domain. 6. **Excluding k=0**: - Since a linear function with k=0 would be horizontal and not intersect with y=-x+3 in the given domain in a meaningful way, we exclude k=0 from the possible values.

Similarly, if ( n ) is also three times a perfect cube, then we can write: [ n = 3m^3 ] for some integer ( m ). Equating the two expressions for ( n ): [ 2k^2 = 3m^3 ] # Step-by-step solution: 1. **Find common factors**: Given ( 2k^2 = 3m^3 ), it means that ( n ) must be a common multiple that satisfies both being twice a perfect square and three times a perfect cube. 2. **Prime factorization form**: Consider the general prime factorization form of ( n ): [ n = 2^a cdot 3^b cdot p_1^{c_1} cdots p_r^{c_r} ] where ( p_i ) are prime numbers other than 2 and 3, and ( a, b, c_i ) are non-negative integers. Since ( n ) is twice a perfect square: - The power of 2 in its factorization should be odd, so ( a = 2j + 1 ) for some integer ( j ). - All other powers must be even, so ( b ) and ( c_i ) must all be even numbers. Also, since ( n ) is three times a perfect cube: - The power of 3 in its factorization should be one more than a multiple of three, so ( b = 3k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ). - All other powers must be multiples of three, so ( a ) can be ( a = 3m ). 3. **Simplify and solve for smallest ( n )**: The smallest positive integer that satisfies all conditions for ( a ) and ( b ) will be when ( j = 1 ) and ( k = 1 ): - Then, ( a = 3m , text{where} , m = 1 implies a = 3 ). - ( b = 3k + 1 , text{where} , k = 1 implies b = 4 ).

We need to prove that the sequence of the radii of the circles ( K_n ) converges to zero. 2. **Key Fact:** The key fact mentioned is that if inside a circle you have a convex ( s )-gon, and inside this ( s )-gon you have another circle, then the radius of the inner circle is at most ( frac{1 + cosfrac{pi}{s}}{2} ) times the radius of the outer circle. 3. **Proof of the Key Fact:** Consider a circle of radius ( R ) and an inscribed convex ( s )-gon. Let the radius of the circle inscribed in this ( s )-gon be ( r ). We need to show that: [ r leq frac{1 + cosfrac{pi}{s}}{2} R ] - **Step 1:** Consider the circle of radius ( R = 1 ) (without loss of generality). The radius of the inscribed circle ( r ) is such that ( r > frac{1}{2} ). - **Step 2:** The circle concentric with the first one and radius ( 2r - 1 ) is also inside both circles. This is because the distance from the center to the edge of the inner circle is ( r ), and the distance from the center to the edge of the outer circle is ( 1 ). Hence, the radius ( 2r - 1 ) is the distance from the center to the edge of the inner circle minus the distance from the center to the edge of the outer circle. - **Step 3:** If ( 2r - 1 > cosfrac{pi}{s} ), it is easy to prove that any chord of the outermost circle subtending an angle of at least ( frac{2pi}{s} ) intersects the innermost circle. This implies that ( 2s ) segments between the outermost and the innermost circles cannot close to form an ( s )-gon. 4. **Bounding the Radii:** Given the key fact, the radius of ( K_{n+1} ) is at most ( frac{1 + cosfrac{pi}{s}}{2} ) times the radius of ( K_n ). Let ( r_n ) be the radius of ( K_n ).

Since ( s geq 3 ), we have: [ cosfrac{pi}{s} < 1 implies frac{1 + cosfrac{pi}{s}}{2} < 1 ] Therefore, the ratio of the geometric sequence is less than 1. 6. **Convergence to Zero:** Since ( r_n ) is bounded above by a geometric sequence with a ratio less than 1, it follows that ( r_n ) converges to zero.

Given that there are 140 girls, we can use the ratio to find out how many boys there are. The number of parts that represent girls in the ratio is 7. So, if 7 parts represent 140 girls, then 1 part represents 140 / 7 girls, which is 20 girls per part. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 5:7, we have 5 parts representing boys. Therefore, the number of boys is 5 parts times 20 girls per part, which is 5 * 20 = 100 boys.

The sweater is marked up by 66.66666666666666% (which is 2/3 in fraction form) from the wholesale cost for its normal retail price.

Let's denote the selling price at this discount as S. A 20% profit on the wholesale cost means: S = W + 0.20W S = (1 + 0.20)W S = 1.20W To find the discount percentage, we need to know how much less the selling price (S) is than the normal retail price (R). The discount amount (D) is: D = R - S Substitute R and S with their respective expressions in terms of W: D = (5/3)W - 1.20W To combine these terms, we need a common denominator, which is 3: D = (5/3)W - (3.60/3)W D = (5 - 3.60)/3 * W D = 1.40/3 * W D = 0.46666666666667W Now, to find the discount percentage, we divide the discount amount by the normal retail price and multiply by 100: Discount Percentage = (D / R) * 100 Discount Percentage = (0.46666666666667W / (5/3)W) * 100 The W's cancel out: Discount Percentage = (0.46666666666667 / (5/3)) * 100 Now, divide 0.46666666666667 by (5/3): Discount Percentage = (0.46666666666667 * 3/5) * 100 Calculate the multiplication: Discount Percentage = (1.40/5) * 100 Discount Percentage = 0.28 * 100 Discount Percentage = 28% Therefore, the sweater is sold at a boxed{28%} discount."},{"prompt":"Several circles are inscribed in a corner, and their radii increase such that each subsequent circle touches the previous one.

Let's check for small prime values of ( p_2 ): - If ( p_2 = 3 ): [ p^2 = 64 cdot 3 - 23 = 192 - 23 = 169 implies p = 13 ] Since 13 is a prime, this is a valid solution. - If ( p_2 = 5 ): [ p^2 = 64 cdot 5 - 23 = 320 - 23 = 297 ] 297 is not a perfect square. - If ( p_2 = 7 ): [ p^2 = 64 cdot 7 - 23 = 448 - 23 = 425 ] 425 is not a perfect square. - If ( p_2 = 11 ): [ p^2 = 64 cdot 11 - 23 = 704 - 23 = 681 ] 681 is not a perfect square. - If ( p_2 = 17 ): [ p^2 = 64 cdot 17 - 23 = 1088 - 23 = 1065 ] 1065 is not a perfect square. Therefore, the only valid solution is when ( p = 13 ). Conclusion: There is only one prime ( p ) such that the number of positive divisors of ( p^2 + 23 ) is equal to 14.

However, there's a more systematic way to do this by considering the contribution of each digit in each place value. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange 3 unique digits, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. The possible 3-digit numbers are: 234, 243, 324, 342, 423, and 432. Each digit will appear in each place (hundreds, tens, ones) an equal number of times. Since there are 6 numbers and 3 positions, each digit will appear 2 times in each position. Now, let's calculate the contribution of each digit in each position: - Hundreds place: Each digit (2, 3, 4) will contribute its value times 100 times 2 (because each digit appears twice in the hundreds place). So, the total contribution for the hundreds place is (2+3+4) * 100 * 2 = 9 * 100 * 2 = 1800. - Tens place: Each digit will contribute its value times 10 times 2. So, the total contribution for the tens place is (2+3+4) * 10 * 2 = 9 * 10 * 2 = 180. - Ones place: Each digit will contribute its value times 1 times 2. So, the total contribution for the ones place is (2+3+4) * 1 * 2 = 9 * 1 * 2 = 18. Now, we add up the contributions from each place value to get the total sum: Total sum = Contribution from hundreds + Contribution from tens + Contribution from ones Total sum = 1800 + 180 + 18 Total sum = 1998 So, the sum of all possible 3-digit numbers that can be constructed using the digits 2, 3, and 4 is boxed{1998} ."},{"prompt":"A certain store has a product with a cost price of 100 yuan and a selling price of 150 yuan.

The rest must be liars. 3. **Analyzing the Statements of the Fourth and Fifth Inhabitants:** - The fourth says all the previous ones are liars, implying there are no knights among the first three. If the fourth is telling the truth (making the fourth a knight), this contradicts our earlier finding that one of the first three could be a knight. - Therefore, the fourth must be lying.

A signaler needs to stretch a wire from point A to point B, the distance between which is l.

The distance between A and B is l. The goal is to prove that a wire of length 1.6l is sufficient to connect A and B, navigating around any trees along the path. 2. **Navigating Around Trees:** Suppose we pull the wire along the straight line segment AB. Whenever we encounter a tree, we go around it using the shortest possible arc on the cylindrical surface of the tree. To prove that the wire length does not exceed 1.6l, we need to show that the path along the arc is at most 1.6 times the length of the straight line path. 3. **Arc and Chord Length Relationship:** Consider a tree we need to navigate around, forming an obstacle on the line AB. Let varphi be the angle at the center of the circle corresponding to half the arc we traverse. The length of the arc corresponding to this angle 2varphi is given by: [ s = 2Rvarphi ] where R is the radius of the circle (tree). The length of the chord (straight line through the diameter) subtended by the angle 2varphi is: [ c = 2R sin(varphi) ] 4. **Length Ratio of Arc to Chord:** We seek to determine the ratio frac{s}{c}: [ frac{s}{c} = frac{2Rvarphi}{2Rsin(varphi)} = frac{varphi}{sin(varphi)} ] 5. **Bounding the Ratio:** It is known from calculus that the ratio frac{varphi}{sin(varphi)} achieves its maximum value when varphi = frac{pi}{2}.

So we can write: Votes in favor = Votes against + 78 Votes in favor = 0.375 * T + 78 Since every vote falls into one of these three categories, we can write the total number of votes as the sum of the votes in favor, against, and neutral: T = Votes in favor + Votes against + Neutral votes T = (0.375 * T + 78) + (0.375 * T) + (0.125 * T) Combining like terms, we get: T = 0.375T + 0.375T + 0.125T + 78 T = 0.875T + 78 Now, we can solve for T by subtracting 0.875T from both sides of the equation: T - 0.875T = 78 0.125T = 78 Finally, we divide both sides by 0.125 to find T: T = 78 / 0.125 T = 624 Therefore, the total number of votes cast was boxed{624} ."},{"prompt":"A box contains eight cards.

We are also given that the minimum possible combined number of horses and ponies on the ranch is 164. Therefore, H + P ≥ 164. Substituting H = P + 4 into the inequality, we get: (P + 4) + P ≥ 164 2P + 4 ≥ 164 2P ≥ 160 P ≥ 80 Since we are looking for the minimum number of ponies, let's assume P = 80. This means H = P + 4 = 80 + 4 = 84. Now, let's denote the fraction of the ponies with horseshoes as x. Then, the number of ponies with horseshoes is xP. We are told that exactly 5/8 of the ponies with horseshoes are from Iceland. So, the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes is (5/8)xP. Since we are dealing with whole animals, the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes must also be a whole number. The smallest whole number that is 5/8 of another whole number is 5 (since 5 is the smallest non-zero numerator in the fraction 5/8). Therefore, the smallest possible value for xP is 8, because 5/8 of 8 is 5. So, we have xP = 8. Since we assumed P = 80, we can solve for x: x * 80 = 8 x = 8 / 80 x = 1 / 10 Therefore, the fraction of the ponies that have horseshoes is boxed{1/10} ."},{"prompt":"ally, there were 10 banks in a certain country.

Thus, the minimum value is obtained when a_i = 1 and b_j = 1, for all i and j: boxed{n^2}"},{"prompt":"Max picks three different cards consecutively without replacement from a standard 52card deck.

However, if ( k geq 3 ), the product ( p_1 p_2 p_3 ) includes the smallest three odd primes (i.e., 3, 5, and 7), and thus ( p_1 p_2 p_3 ) must be divisible by 7. Hence, for ( k geq 3 ), ( a^n + 1 ) cannot satisfy ( p_1 p_2 p_3 = a^n + 1). - Therefore, ( k leq 2 ). Let's check possible values: - For ( k = 1 ), ( p_1 = 3 ), so ( a^n = 2 rightleftharpoons text{no valid integer solution} ). - For ( k = 2 ), ( p_1 p_2 = 3 cdot 5 = 15 ), hence ( a^n = 14rightleftharpoons text{no valid integer solution}). 4. **Case 2: ( a ) has an odd prime divisor** - Let ( q ) be an odd prime divisor of ( a ). Since ( p_1 p_2 ldots p_k = a^n + 1 ), and from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on prime factorization, we can derive a contradiction. - According to a previous reference problem, if ( a ) has an odd prime divisor, then ( a^n + 1 ) must be strictly greater than a product of distinct primes, leading to the contradiction as ( a^n + 1 > p_1 p_2 ldots p_k ). 5. Thus, in both cases, we observe contradictions or find no possible solutions for any ( k ). **Conclusion:** There are no natural ( k ) such that the product of the first ( k ) odd primes, decreased by 1, is an exact power of a natural number (greater than the first power).

Here, adjacency means that two rectangles share at least one point on their boundaries. 1. **Assigning colors based on coordinates**: Each rectangle can be represented by the coordinates of its left-bottom corner (x, y). We'll use the coordinate parity (even or odd) of these coordinates for our coloring system. We have four possible combinations of parities for (x, y): - Both x and y are even. - x is even, and y is odd. - x is odd, and y is even. - Both x and y are odd. 2. **Color assignment rule**: Assign a unique color to each combination of parities: - Color 1: (text{even}, text{even}) - Color 2: (text{even}, text{odd}) - Color 3: (text{odd}, text{even}) - Color 4: (text{odd}, text{odd}) 3. **Proving that rectangles do not share color if they share boundary points**: - Suppose two rectangles share a vertical side. This means they are adjacent vertically. If one rectangle has its left-bottom corner at (x_1, y_1) and the other at (x_2, y_2), then x_1 = x_2 pm w, where w is the width of the rectangle's side. - Since each rectangle’s width is an odd number of cells, it follows that the parity of x coordinates of two adjacent rectangles will be different. Thus, their colors will be different. - Similarly, if two rectangles share a horizontal side, it means they are adjacent horizontally. If one rectangle has its left-bottom corner at (x_1, y_1) and the other at (x_2, y_2), then y_1 = y_2 pm h, where h is the height of the rectangle’s side. - Given that each rectangle’s height is also an odd number of cells, the parity of y coordinates of two adjacent rectangles will differ. Thus, their colors will be different. 4. **Conclusion**: By coloring each rectangle based on the parity of its left-bottom corner coordinates, no two adjacent rectangles will share the same color. This is because the sum of the changes in coordinates (width or height, both odd) will always lead to different parities, thus ensuring the difference in colors. Hence, it is guaranteed that the rectangles can be colored in four different colors such that no two rectangles of the same color share a boundary point.

Thus, for x in (frac{1}{2}, 1), h'(x) < 0, meaning h(x) is decreasing; for x in (1, +infty), h'(x) > 0, meaning h(x) is increasing. At x = 1, h(x) attains its minimum value, which is h(1) = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the function y = lnleft(frac{e^{t_2 - 1}}{ln(2t_2 - 1) + 2}right) attains its minimum value at lnfrac{1}{2}, which simplifies to -ln 2. Hence, the minimum value of t_2 - t_1 is -ln 2.

This makes AM = MC = frac{AC}{2} = frac{10}{2} = 5. - Because ABCD has equal sides, triangles AMB, BMC, CMD, and DMA are right triangles. Each of these right triangles has legs AM = 5 and some unknown height h. 3. **Relate the area of the quadrilateral to the sum of the triangles:** - The total area of the quadrilateral ABCD is the sum of the areas of the four right triangles. - The area of one right triangle (e.g., AMB) is: [ text{Area of } triangle AMB = frac{1}{2} times AM times h = frac{1}{2} times 5 times h = frac{5h}{2} ] - Since there are four identical right triangles, the total area is: [ 4 times frac{5h}{2} = 10h ] - This total area is given as 120, so: [ 10h = 120 ] - Solving for h: [ h = frac{120}{10} = 12 ] 4. **Determine the side length of the quadrilateral:** - Each side of the quadrilateral is the hypotenuse of one of the right triangles.

According to the problem, C1 is Rs. 291.67. The book sold at a loss (C1) was sold at 85% of its cost price (since it was sold at a 15% loss), and the book sold at a gain (C2) was sold at 119% of its cost price (since it was sold at a 19% gain). Since both books were sold at the same price, we can set up the following equation: 0.85 * C1 = 1.19 * C2 We know C1 is Rs. 291.67, so we can substitute that into the equation: 0.85 * 291.67 = 1.19 * C2 247.417 = 1.19 * C2 Now, we can solve for C2: C2 = 247.417 / 1.19 C2 = 207.916 So, the cost price of the book sold at a gain (C2) is Rs. 207.916. The total cost of the two books (C1 + C2) is: Total cost = C1 + C2 Total cost = 291.67 + 207.916 Total cost = Rs. 499.586 Therefore, the total cost of the two books was Rs. 499.586.

To find the maximum number of sides that one of these smaller polygons can have, let's consider the general properties of polygon diagonals and the subpolygons they form. 2. First, observe that in any convex polygon with n sides, each vertex connects to n-3 other vertices, forming n(n-3)/2 diagonals in total. However, counting diagonals isn't directly necessary for our task. 3. We know every polygon can be divided into triangles (via triangulation). For a k-gon, any triangulation will include k-2 triangles. Hence, these triangles will share edges and create vertices. 4. If we want to find the polygon with the maximum number of sides among the smaller polygons formed by diagonals, we need to minimize internal triangulations and maximize perimeter exposures, so we consider two diagonals from each vertex of the original 1950-gon. 5. Select a vertex ( A_1 ) of the original polygon. From ( A_1 ), draw two diagonals ( A_1 A_p ) and ( A_1 A_q ) such that these diagonals form the boundaries for the subpolygon we are interested in. For maximum side count, we want ( A_p ) and ( A_q ) to be adjacent to each other. 6. Suppose ( A_p ) and ( A_q ) are adjacent, i.e., ( A_q = A_{p+1} ). Since there are always 1948 vertices left out of consideration (( p leq frac{1950}{2} = 975 )), the maximum feasible ( p ) (excluding very illogical cases with strange overlaps) follows ( 975 < p leq 1950-2 ). 7. Construct the longest chain by drawing diagonals such that they link consecutive vertices. This ensures no unnecessary triangulations forming additional diagonals inside. - Starting from ( A_1 ), we could use all vertices till we reach ( A_{1949} ). - Thus, the polygon formed directly aligning ( A_1 ) to ( A_{1950} ). 8. This configuration concludes the maximal non-triangulated shape has ( 1949 ) sides by the periphery construction. 9.

Since they travel at a rate of 6 miles per day and it takes them two days, the distance up the mountain is: Distance up = Rate up * Time up Distance up = 6 miles/day * 2 days Distance up = 12 miles Now, we know the route down the mountain is 18 miles long and it takes the same amount of time as the route up, which is two days. To find the rate down, we use the formula: Rate down = Distance down / Time down We know the distance down is 18 miles and the time down is 2 days, so: Rate down = 18 miles / 2 days Rate down = 9 miles/day Now we have the rate up (6 miles/day) and the rate down (9 miles/day).

The rectangle then extends to ((100, 0)) horizontally and to ((0, 101)) vertically, making the opposite vertex of the origin ((100, 101)). 2. **Equation of the Diagonal**: The equation of the line connecting ((0,0)) to ((100,101)) is: [ y = frac{101}{100}x ] 3. **Intersection Points with Grid Lines**: The diagonal line ( y = frac{101}{100}x ) will intersect both vertical and horizontal grid lines. Vertical grid lines are at (x = 1, 2, ldots, 99), and horizontal grid lines are at (y = 1, 2, ldots, 100). Both sets of lines will intersect the diagonal, creating points of division along it. 4. **Calculating Total Intersection Points**: - For vertical lines intersecting at points (x = k) where (1 leq k leq 99), we will have 99 vertical intersecting points. - For horizontal lines intersecting at points (y = m) where (1 leq m leq 100), we will have 100 horizontal intersecting points. 5. **Counting the Grid Points**: Because the diagonal may pass exactly through grid points where horizontal and vertical lines cross, we should ensure no double counting. For any grid point where (x) and (y) coordinates are integers ( (a, b)), the condition that must be satisfied (as both (a) and (b) are integers) is: [ frac{101}{100} a = b ] This translates the condition to be that the fraction (frac{101}{100}) must be simplified, which it is not because 101 and 100 are co-primes. Thus, these points are not aligned such that the diagonal passes through grid points exactly. 6. **Final Count**: The total number of intersections is the sum of the individual vertical and horizontal intersections minus the number of grid points exactly on the diagonal: [ text{Total intersections} = (99) + (100) - 0 = 199 ] 7. **Number of Segments**: Since each intersection point divides the diagonal into a new segment, the 199 intersection points will divide the diagonal into (199 + 1 = 200) segments. # Conclusion: [ boxed{200} ]"},{"prompt":"a company, some percent of the employees are men.

According to the information given: - 60% of the employees are unionized, so the number of unionized employees is ( 0.60E ). - 70% of the unionized employees are men, so the number of men in the union is ( 0.70 times 0.60E = 0.42E ). Now, we know that 65% of the non-union employees are women. This means that 35% of the non-union employees are men because ( 100% - 65% = 35% ). The number of non-union employees is the remainder of the employees after subtracting the unionized employees, which is ( E - 0.60E = 0.40E ). The number of men among the non-union employees is ( 0.35 times 0.40E = 0.14E ). To find the percentage of the total employees that are men, we add the men in the union and the men in the non-union group: Total men = Men in union + Men in non-union Total men = ( 0.42E + 0.14E = 0.56E ) The percentage of the total employees that are men is ( frac{0.56E}{E} times 100% = 56% ).

Initially, we are given three sides (a), (b), and (c) that form a triangle. By the triangle inequality theorem, the following must hold true: [ a + b > c, quad b + c > a, quad a + c > b ] 2. We need to demonstrate that for any (n = 2, 3, 4, ldots), the sides (sqrt[n]{a}), (sqrt[n]{b}), and (sqrt[n]{c}) also form a triangle. To do this, we need to verify the triangle inequality conditions with these new sides. 3. Consider the inequality for sides (sqrt[n]{a}) and (sqrt[n]{b}): [ sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{b} > sqrt[n]{c} ] We start by raising both sides of this inequality to the (n)-th power: [ (sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{b})^n > left(sqrt[n]{c}right)^n ] 4. Expanding the left-hand side using the Binomial theorem for two terms: [ (sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{b})^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (sqrt[n]{a})^{n-k} (sqrt[n]{b})^k ] The first and last terms of this summation are: [ (sqrt[n]{a})^n + (sqrt[n]{b})^n = a + b ] Since all other terms are positive, it follows that: [ (sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{b})^n > a + b ] 5. Given that (a + b > c) (from the initial triangle inequality): [ (sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{b})^n > a + b > c = (sqrt[n]{c})^n ] Therefore, we have: [ sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{b} > sqrt[n]{c} ] 6. The above steps show one of the inequalities. We must verify the other two similarly: - For (sqrt[n]{b} + sqrt[n]{c} > sqrt[n]{a}): [ b + c > a implies (sqrt[n]{b} + sqrt[n]{c})^n > (sqrt[n]{a})^n ] - For (sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{c} > sqrt[n]{b}): [ a + c > b implies (sqrt[n]{a} + sqrt[n]{c})^n > (sqrt[n]{b})^n ] 7.

Let us define a new function g(x) = frac{f(x)}{cos(x)}. Finding its derivative, g'(x) = frac{f'(x)cdotcos(x) - f(x)sin(x)}{cos^2(x)} = frac{f'(x)cdotcos(x) + f(x)sin(x)}{cos^2(x)} < 0. Therefore, g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}). As such, we have gleft(frac{pi}{3}right) < gleft(frac{pi}{6}right), which implies frac{fleft(frac{pi}{3}right)}{cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right)} < frac{fleft(frac{pi}{6}right)}{cosleft(frac{pi}{6}right)}, and consequently, sqrt{3} fleft(frac{pi}{3}right) < fleft(frac{pi}{6}right).

Given: - Distance ( OA = a ) - Distance ( OB = b ) - Angle ( angle AOB = alpha ) - Speed of pedestrians ( w ) We will consider the situation both when ( a geq b ) and ( b > a ). 1. **When ( a geq b ):** - The pedestrians meet at point ( O ) at time ( t = 0 ) initially. - At any later time ( t ), they move towards the point ( O ), covering ( AM = BN = wt ). - Considering the triangle formed by the points ( A, O, ) and ( B ): - ( B P = AM = MP ) - ( triangle AMP ) is isosceles with ( angle AMP = alpha ). - Project point ( P ) on ( OB ) such that ( BP perp AC ): - Using properties of right triangles and medians: [ boxed{d_0 = (a-b) cos left( frac{alpha}{2} right) } ] - The time ( t_0 ): [ P_{0}M_{0}=v t_{0} = frac{a + b}{2} ] Solves to: [ boxed{t_0 = frac{a + b}{2 w}} ] 2. **If ( b > a ):** - Applying similar principles but considering ( b geq a ) leads to: If (b > a), the minimum distance will be at: [ boxed{sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b cos alpha}} ] - And the time ( t_0 ): [ boxed{t_0 = frac{b - a}{2 w}} ] In both cases above, determining the distance and corresponding time at which the distance between pedestrians is minimum is achieved by similar geometric projections and trigonometric principles.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Initial Equation Manipulation**: [ frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=frac{g(x+2)}{f(x-2)} ] Multiplying both sides by f(x-2)g(x), we get: [ f(x)f(x-2) = g(x)g(x+2) ] This can be rewritten in terms of a new function h(x), where h(x) = frac{f(x)}{g(x+2)}. Thus, we have: [ h(x)h(x-2) = 1 ] 2. **Periodicity of h(x)**: From h(x)h(x-2) = 1, we can also infer that h(x+2)h(x) = 1.

Solving the system of equations begin{cases} x^2 = 4y y-b = k(x-a) end{cases}, we get x^2 - 4kx + 4ka - 4b = 0.

How many such fourdigit numbers are there?","completion":": To solve the problem where a four-digit number overline{abcd} is divisible by 3, and a, b, c are three consecutive integers in some permutation, we proceed as follows: 1. Assume that a, b, and c are three consecutive integers. Let: [ a = k, quad b = k+1, quad c = k+2 ] where k is an integer. 2. Since the number overline{abcd} is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Therefore, we have: [ 3 mid (a + b + c + d) ] 3. Substitute a, b, and c with k, k+1, and k+2 respectively: [ a + b + c = k + (k+1) + (k+2) = 3k + 3 ] Hence: [ 3 mid (3k + 3 + d) ] 4. Simplify the expression: [ 3 mid (3(k+1) + d) ] This means d must be such that the expression 3(k+1) + d is divisible by 3. Since 3(k+1) is always divisible by 3, d must also be divisible by 3. Thus, possible values of d are: [ d = 0, 3, 6, 9 ] 5. Consider different values of k and the permutations of a, b, c: - For k = 0, the consecutive integers are 0, 1, 2. Permutations of (a, b, c) are: [ (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0) ] These give us 6 permutations. - For other values of k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, there are 3 consecutive integers (k, k+1, k+2) each. The number of permutations of three numbers is 3! = 6. So, each k gives 6 permutations. 6. Summarize the number of valid digits for a, b, c: - For k = 0, we have 4 valid permutations. - For k = 1,2,...,7, we have 7 sets of 3 consecutive integers, each with 6 permutations. Therefore, 7 times 6 = 42 permutations in total. Thus, the total number of four-digit numbers overline{abcd} is: [ 4 + 42 = 46 ] 7.

Without loss of generality, we can consider ( operatorname{cont}(f) = 1 ). Recall that the content ( operatorname{cont}(p) ) of a polynomial ( p ) is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of its coefficients. 3. **Normalization of polynomial ( g )**: Choose a natural number ( m ) such that ( mg ) has integer coefficients.

This implies that the factorization ( f = (rg)(sh) ) holds in the ring of integers ( mathbb{Z} ). 7. **Implication of irreducibility**: Consequently, if ( f ) can be factored into polynomials with rational coefficients, those factors can be adjusted to have integer coefficients without changing the irreducibility property.

For S_{5}, this becomes S_{5} = frac{5}{2}[2a_{1} + 4d]. Since a_{3} = a_{1} + 2d, we can equate a_{3} to S_{5}, leading to a_{1} + 2d = frac{5}{2}[2a_{1} + 4d]. Simplifying this, we find that a_{3} = 0. 2. **Using a_{2}a_{4} = S_{4}:** For a_{2} = a_{1} + d and a_{4} = a_{1} + 3d, the product a_{2}a_{4} becomes (a_{1} + d)(a_{1} + 3d).

Let's start by analyzing the given statement: a + b^2 mid a^2 + b. By the inequality a + b^2 < a^2 + b, we can rewrite it as: [ a + b^2 < a^2 + b implies (a - b)(a + b - 1) > 0. ] 2. From the inequality (a-b)(a+b-1) > 0, we deduce that a > b. 3. Let us proceed by assuming (a + b^2 = p^k) for some prime p and integer k. If a and b are not coprime, we can assume their greatest common divisor is a power of p. Let (a, b) = p^r with r geq 1 and express ( a = a_1 p^r ) and ( b = b_1 p^r ) where ((a_1, b_1) = 1). 4. Substituting these into our divisibility condition, we get: [ a + b^2 = a_1 p^r + b_1^2 p^{2r} = p^k. ] We know that all terms involving (a_1) and (b_1) must add up to a single prime power term, implying: [ a_1 + b_1^2 p^r = p^{k-r}. ] So (p) must divide the expression (a_1 + b_1^2 p^r), but (p) does not divide (a_1) nor (b_1^2) due to ((a_1, b_1) = 1), leading to a contradiction. Hence, ((a, b) = 1). 5. We conclude (a + b^2 mid ab - 1), and since (a + b^2 nmid b - 1), it implies that (a + b^2 mid ab + b^3). Therefore, we must have: [ a + b^2 mid b^3 + 1 = (b + 1)(b^2 - b + 1). ] Since (gcd(b+1, b^2 - b + 1) = gcd(b+1, 3)), the gcd is either 3 or 1. 6. If (p neq 3), then (p^k mid (b + 1)(b^2 - b + 1)), which implies (p^k mid b + 1) or (p^k mid b^2 - b + 1). However, since (p^k = a + b^2 > b + 1) and (p^k = a + b^2 > b^2 - b + 1), contradictions arise. Hence, (p = 3). 7. Let (a + b^2 = 3^k).

Consider the (n-3) times (n-3) platinum matrix ((C_{n-3})) following the above construction, and place it in the top-left corner. - Consider a (3 times 3) platinum matrix ((C_3)) and place it in the bottom-right corner: [ C_3 = begin{matrix} n-2 & n & n-1 n & n-1 & n-2 n-1 & n-2 & n end{matrix} ] 8. **Filling Remaining Entries:** - We fill the 3 times (n-3) matrix and the (n-3) times 3 matrix adjacent to C_{n-3}. By choosing 3 transversals from the (n-3) times (n-3) matrix and filling the entries properly ensuring no repeat in rows and columns. 9. **Ensuring No Two Transversals Overlap:** - At least one diagonal from (C_{n-3}) and one from (C_3) will be free to make a transversal of the whole (n times n) matrix not lying on the main diagonal. 10. **Example for n=8:** [ begin{array}{|cccc|ccc} 1 & 8 & 7 & 6 & & & 2 & 1 & 8 & 7 & & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 8 & & & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & & & hline & & & & 6 & 7 & 8 & & & & 7 & 8 & 6 & & & & 8 & 6 & 7 end{array} ] 11. **Verification for Specific Instances:** - (n=4): [ begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 end{matrix} ] - (n=6): [ begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 5 & 3 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 2 4 & 1 & 5 & 2 & 6 & 3 2 & 4 & 1 & 6 & 3 & 5 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 3 & 6 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 end{matrix} ] # Conclusion: For all (n geq 3), a platinum matrix can be constructed.

In February, Bennett sells twice as many window screens as in January, so he sells 2X window screens. In March, the sales become unpredictable, and he sells half of the total screens sold in January and February. So, the total sales in January and February are X + 2X = 3X. Therefore, in March, he sells (1/2) * 3X = 3X/2 window screens. In April, he doubles the sales made in March, but he has to cap the sales at 20,000 window screens. Since we know that he sold 18,000 window screens in April, this means that double the March sales would have been 18,000, but he was limited to 20,000. Since he sold 18,000, we can infer that the doubling did not exceed the cap. Therefore, the sales in March were half of 18,000, which is 9,000 window screens.

Evaluating f(3): [f(3) = 3^2 = 9.] Conclusion: The value of f(3) = 9, and as f(x) = x^2 is the only solution that meets f(1) = 1, the sum of all possible values of f(3) is (boxed{9})."},{"prompt":"Let ( a ) and ( b ) be positive integers. Given that ( 4ab 1 ) divides ( left(4a^2 1right)^2 ), prove that ( a = b ).","completion":"To prove ( a = b ) under the given conditions, we will use proof by contradiction and the concept of \\"bad pairs.\\" A pair ((a, b)) of positive integers is called a \\"bad pair\\" if ( a ne b ) and ( 4ab - 1 mid (4a^2 - 1)^2 ). 1. **Assume the existence of a bad pair ((a, b)):** Suppose ((a, b)) is a bad pair. Without loss of generality, assume ( a < b ). 2. **Investigate the divisibility condition:** Since ( 4ab - 1 mid (4a^2 - 1)^2 ), let: [ r = frac{(4a^2 - 1)^2}{4ab - 1} ] Based on this, we can write: [ r(4ab - 1) = (4a^2 - 1)^2 ] 3. **Use properties of congruences:** By considering modulo ( 4a ): [ r equiv -r cdot (-1) pmod{4a} equiv r(4ab - 1) equiv (4a^2 - 1)^2 pmod{4a} ] But since ( (4a^2 - 1)^2 equiv -1 pmod{4a} ), we conclude that: [ r equiv -1 pmod{4a} ] 4. **Find a smaller integer ( c ):** There exists an integer ( c ) such that ( r = 4ac - 1 ): [ 4ac - 1 = frac{(4a^2 - 1)^2}{4ab - 1} ] Since ( 4ac - 1 < 4a^2 - 1 ), it follows that: [ c < a ] 5. **Construct a new bad pair:** By the construction, ( 4ac - 1 mid (4a^2 - 1)^2 ), so ((a, c)) is also a bad pair with ( c < b ). 6. **Symmetry of bad pairs:** Note that if ((a, b)) is a bad pair, then ((b, a)) should also be a bad pair. Thus, when considering ((b, a)) as: [ 4ab - 1 mid (4b^2 - 1)^2 ] We get: [ 1 equiv (4ab)(4ab-1) = (4b^2 - 1)^2 pmod{4ab - 1} ] This shows ( 4ab - 1 mid (4b^2 - 1)^2 ), ensuring the symmetry property of bad pairs. 7. **Contradiction via minimality:** Use the method of infinite descent (reductio ad absurdum). Suppose there exists a bad pair ((a, b)) such that ( 2a + b ) is minimal. - If ( a < b ), from our properties: - There exists ( c ) such that ((a, c)) is a bad pair and ( c < b ). - Thus, ( 2a + c < 2a + b ), which contradicts the minimality of ((a, b)). - If ( b < a ), then ((b, a)) is also a bad pair (due to symmetry): - Hence, ( 2b + a < 2a + b ), again contradicting the minimality. 8. **Conclusion:** The existence of a bad pair leads to a contradiction, thus proving no such bad pairs exist.

Hence, any configuration of 3-element subsets with (n leq 5) will work trivially. 3. **Counting the Maximum Subsets for (n geq 6):** - Consider (n = 6) as a base case. - For any set with 6 elements, there are (binom{6}{3} = 20) possible 3-element subsets. - If we form pairs of complementary sets (like ({1, 2, 3}) and ({4, 5, 6})), only one set from each pair can be included to ensure none of the selected subsets are disjoint. - However, we can maximize the number by choosing all subsets containing a fixed element.

The molar mass of an element is the mass of one mole of that element and is expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).

For any ( p+1 ) different positive integers, prove that there exist two numbers among them for which the quotient of the larger number divided by their greatest common divisor is at least ( p+1 ).","completion":"1. Let ( p ) be a prime number and consider ( p+1 ) distinct positive integers. Our goal is to prove that there exist two numbers among them such that the quotient of the larger number by their greatest common divisor is not smaller than ( p+1 ). 2. To start, let's assume that all these ( p+1 ) integers are multiples of ( p ). This assumption doesn't affect the final result as we can divide all numbers by ( p ) without changing their relative properties or the outcome. Hence, we can assume that there is at least one number that is not divisible by ( p ). 3. Consider two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) with ( a > b ) that are in the same non-zero residue class modulo ( p ). This means ( a equiv b pmod{p} ). 4. This implies that ( p mid (a - b) ). Because ( a neq b ) and they are reduced residues modulo ( p ), we have ((a, b) = 1). Therefore, we can write: [ p left| frac{a - b}{(a, b)} right. . ] 5. Since ( (a, b) = 1 ), we have (frac{a-b}{1} = a - b). Therefore: [ p mid (a - b). ] 6. Consider the quotient when ( a ) is divided by ( b ) involving their greatest common divisor: [ frac{a}{(a, b)} = frac{a}{1} = a. ] 7. This indicates that ( frac{a}{(a, b)} = a geq p+1 ). 8. Now let’s generalize this case and consider the ( p+1 ) numbers again: - There are ( p ) residue classes modulo ( p ). - By the pigeonhole principle, since we have ( p+1 ) numbers, at least two of them must lie in the same residue class modulo ( p ). 9. Denote these two numbers by ( c ) and ( d ) with ( c > d ): [ c equiv d pmod{p}. ] 10. Hence, ( c - d ) is divisible by ( p ), i.e., ( p mid (c - d) ). 11. Consider again the quotient involving the greatest common divisor: [ frac{c}{(c, d)} = frac{c - d}{(c, d)} + frac{d}{(c, d)}. ] 12. Since ( (c, d) = 1 ), it's simplified to: [ frac{c}{(c, d)} = c geq p+1, ] because ( c ) is at least ( p+1 ) (otherwise it would not form a complete residue system modulo ( p )).

For Wednesday, the time spent is (T_W = frac{D_W}{3}). For Friday, the time spent is (T_F = frac{D_F}{6}). The total time spent exercising is the sum of the times spent on each day: [ T_M + T_W + T_F = 6 ] Substituting the expressions for (T_M), (T_W), and (T_F) we get: [ frac{D_M}{2} + frac{D_W}{3} + frac{D_F}{6} = 6 ] To solve for the distances, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6.

On the other hand, these lines also intersect at the Lemoine point K (see Problem 5.128). 4. The angle bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC are respective lines of the considered similar figures. They intersect at point O, being the circumcenter of triangle ABC. 5. Since the perpendicular bisectors intersect at O, point O lies on the similarity circle S (see Problem 19.51(a)). 6. Furthermore, these lines intersect circle S at the fixed points A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} of triangle ABC (see Problem 19.51(b)). 7.

We need to find the area of this resulting trapezoid. 2. **Draw the Perpendiculars**: Draw perpendicular lines from the points where the corners meet (let's call this point (P)) to the bases of the trapezoid. This results in two right triangles on either side of (P). Since the paper is folded such that the corners touch exactly, these right triangles will be similar. 3. **Identify the Triangles**: Notice that when the paper is folded, the right triangles formed are similar triangles with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. Considering the rectangle's dimensions (8 and 5), let's break this down: - The length of the rectangle corresponds to the hypotenuse of the triangles. - This is evident because any segment connecting the point (P) to the sides creates right triangles considering the rectangle split. 4. **Find the Small Base**: - One leg of the triangle will be part of the base of the trapezoid. - In a 3-4-5 triangle, if one leg is perpendicular from (P) and base lies flat, we use the shorter leg of (3). Thus, the shorter base of the trapezoid is 3. 5. **Calculate the Area**: - The height of the trapezoid is the same as the width of the rectangle (5). - The longer base of the trapezoid is the full width of unfolded rectangle (8). So, the area (A) of the trapezoid is calculated using the formula: [ A = frac{1}{2} times (b_1 + b_2) times h ] where (b_1) is the shorter base, (b_2) is the longer base, and (h) is the height.

The GCD of 3540 and 2860 is the largest number that divides both 3540 and 2860 without leaving a remainder. Let's calculate the GCD of 3540 and 2860: 1. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. 2. We start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder. 3. Then we replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous step. 4. We repeat this process until the remainder is 0. The non-zero remainder just before this is the GCD. Let's do the calculation: Step 1: Divide 3540 by 2860. 3540 ÷ 2860 = 1 with a remainder of 680. Step 2: Replace 3540 with 2860 and 2860 with the remainder 680. 2860 ÷ 680 = 4 with a remainder of 120.

Assume without loss of generality that ( O ) is at the origin, i.e., ( o = 0 ). 3. **Binary operation in terms of complex numbers**: The operation ( a star b ) can be expressed as: [ a star b = zeta (b - a) + a ] This is because the vector ( vec{AC} ) is obtained from ( vec{AB} ) by a ( frac{pi}{3} ) rotation around ( A ), so that ( c - a = zeta (b - a) ). 4. **Express the given equation using complex numbers**: We need to solve: [ I star (M star O) = (O star I) star M ] Substituting the complex number representations, we get: [ I star (M star O) = I star (zeta (0 - m) + m) = I star (-zeta m + m) ] [ (O star I) star M = (zeta (i - 0) + 0) star M = zeta i star M ] 5. **Simplify each side**: [ I star (-zeta m + m) = zeta ((-zeta m + m) - i) + i = zeta (-zeta m + m - i) + i ] [ zeta i star M = zeta (zeta i - m) + m = zeta (zeta i - m) + m ] 6. **Equate the simplified expressions**: [ zeta (-zeta m + m - i) + i = zeta (zeta i - m) + m ] Simplifying further: [ zeta (-zeta m + m - i) + i = zeta^2 i - zeta m + m ] [ -zeta^2 m + zeta m - zeta i + i = zeta^2 i - zeta m + m ] 7. **Use the property of (zeta)**: Recall that (zeta^2 = zeta - 1): [ -(zeta - 1) m + zeta m - zeta i + i = (zeta - 1) i - zeta m + m ] [ -zeta m + m + zeta m - zeta i + i = zeta i - i - zeta m + m ] [ m - zeta i + i = zeta i - i + m ] 8. **Solve for ( i )**: [ -zeta i + i = zeta i - i ] [ 2i = 2zeta i ] [ i = zeta m ] 9. **Conclusion**: The equation ( I star (M star O) = (O star I) star M ) holds if and only if ( i = -zeta m ).

This distance can be computed as the minimum of going clockwise and counterclockwise. 3. **Initial Placement Analysis**: Consider the circumference split into equal arcs by points labeled (0, 671, 1342), forming an equilateral triangle. The pairwise distances among these points are exactly (671 )units each. 4. **Permuted Distance Calculation**: We need to determine the largest (n) such that any permutation of the points results in every pair of initially adjacent points (i.e., not more than (n) units apart) having a same or greater distance between their corresponding positions in the new arrangement. 5. **Permuted Pair Sum Constraint**: After any rearrangement, the sum of the distances between ( (0, 671), (671, 1342), (1342, 0) ) should not exceed the total circle length, i.e., (2013). Hence each pair distance post-permutation (d_i leq frac{2013}{3} = 671). 6. **Upper Bound Estimate**: Since no point can be greater than (671) units apart due to permutation sum constraint, we know distances cannot exceed 671 units. 7. **Example Construction for (n = 670)**: For (n = 670), consider a specific permutation: - Relabel point (i leq 1006) to (a_i = 2i) - Relabel point (i geq 1007) to (a_i = 2i - 2013) 8. **Final Distance Check**: - Calculate new inter-point distances: Given (d leq 670), the new points form pairs ( (a_i, a_j)) such that one arc's length is (2d), thus distance (d' = min(2d, 2013 - 2d)). 9. **Min Calculation**: Since (d' > d), the new arc lengths between any two originally close points (i text{ and } j ) will always satisfy the minimum distance condition ( d' = 2d ). # Conclusion: The maximum (n) such that after permutation, the distance between any two initial points could be at most ( boxed{670} )."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) = 5x x^2.

We can use the formula for distance, which is: Distance = Speed × Time We know the distance (100 km) and the time (10 hours), so we can solve for the speed: 100 km = (5 + v) km/hr × 10 hours Now, we can solve for \\"v\\": 100 km = (50 + 10v) km 100 km - 50 km = 10v km 50 km = 10v km v = 50 km / 10 v = 5 km/hr Therefore, the speed of the stream is boxed{5} km/hr."},{"prompt":"Evaluate (2w)(2w^2)cdots(2w^{12}) where w = e^{2pi i/13}.","completion":"Using the problem's given roots of unity, we recognize that the roots of x^{12} + x^{11} + cdots + x + 1 = 0 are w, w^2, dots, w^{12}.

(The increment of a polynomial ( p ) over the segment ((a, b)) is the number ( p(b)p(a) ).) b) Is it possible to perform an analogous operation for all polynomials of degree not higher than 1995?","completion":"Part (a): 1. First, we need to verify whether the partitioning of the interval [0, 1] into the black intervals [0, frac{1}{4}] and [frac{3}{4}, 1] and the white interval [frac{1}{4}, frac{3}{4}] meets the desired condition. 2. Specifically, we must ensure that for any polynomial p(x) of degree at most 2, the sum of the increments over all black intervals equals the sum of the increments over all white intervals. 3. Observing the increments for constant polynomials 1 and linear polynomials x is trivial since their changes over each interval are zero and proportional to the length of the interval, respectively. 4. Let's explicitly check the increments for the quadratic polynomial p(x) = x^2: - The increment over the white interval left[ frac{1}{4}, frac{3}{4} right] is: [ pleft( frac{3}{4} right) - pleft( frac{1}{4} right) = left( frac{3}{4} right)^2 - left( frac{1}{4} right)^2 = frac{9}{16} - frac{1}{16} = frac{8}{16} = frac{1}{2} ] - The increments over the black intervals [0, frac{1}{4}] and [frac{3}{4}, 1]: [ pleft( frac{1}{4} right) - p(0) = left( frac{1}{4} right)^2 - 0 = frac{1}{16} ] [ p(1) - pleft( frac{3}{4} right) = 1 - left( frac{3}{4} right)^2 = 1 - frac{9}{16} = frac{7}{16} ] - The total increment over the black intervals is: [ frac{1}{16} + frac{7}{16} = frac{8}{16} = frac{1}{2} ] 5. Thus, the sum of increments over the black intervals is indeed equal to the sum of increments over the white interval for p(x) = x^2. 6. Since the condition holds for polynomials 1, x, and x^2, the partitioning is indeed \\"good.\\" Conclusion for part (a): The black intervals are [0, frac{1}{4}] and [frac{3}{4}, 1], and the white interval is [frac{1}{4}, frac{3}{4}].

We are asked whether it is possible to partition the interval in a similar manner for all polynomials of degree up to 1995. 2. Note that if a \\"good\\" partitioning exists for a given interval like [0, 1] for polynomials up to degree n, shifting and stretching (or compressing) this interval will also work without changing the polynomial degrees. 3. We adopt an induction hypothesis: - Assume that for polynomials of degree n, there exists a \\"good\\" partitioning of the interval [0, 1]. 4. For the base case n=0, it is trivial since a constant polynomial has no change (increment) over any interval, so any partitioning will work. 5. Inductive step: - Consider a \\"good\\" partitioning of interval [0, 1] for polynomials of degree up to n. Reflect this partition symmetrically around 0. - If n is even, change the color of the intervals in [-1, 0]; if n is odd, keep the color the same. - This results in a partitioning of [-1, 1] that works for any polynomial of degree n+1 due to symmetry properties. 6. Hence, such a \\"good\\" partitioning can be extended step-by-step to any polynomial degree.

Hence, after each operation, the group behavior remains the same. - If the numbers in a group of ( t ) become identical, they should all be zero because ( |1-1| = 0 ) (since at least some values are initially 0). - Therefore, if starting with one of these groups having a non-zero value, it remains impossible to have all values same in finite steps. 2. **Case Analysis for ( n ) being a power of 2**: - Assume ( n = 2^k ). - Suppose the smallest element among the ( n ) initial integers is ( a_i ).

The transformation ( a_i to |a_i - a_{i+1}| ) changes the labels consistently. - Over multiple operations, monitor the coefficients of ( x ) terms under transformations, expressed as: ( (x+1)^m ). - After ( n-1 ) operations, the ( i )-th coefficient would be from expansion ( (x+1)^{n-1} ), specifically ( binom{n-1}{l} ). - Verify that for ( n = 2^k ), the binomial coefficients ( binom{2^k-1}{l} ) are odd. - Thus, the parity properties are maintained and transform consistently over iterative operations until all values become zero. 4. **General Conclusion**: - For ( n ) values to all equalize to the same value, necessarily ( n ) must be a power of 2 because ( binom{n-1}{l} ) under modulo 2 considerations can't align otherwise. - Hence, the only positive integers ( n ) satisfying the condition are those that are powers of 2.

A covering may contain the same subset multiple times, it must contain at least one subset, and it may contain the empty subset. For example, ({1},{1},{2,3},{3,4},{2,4}) is a uniform covering of 1,2,3,4 (every number occurs in two sets). The covering containing only the empty set is also uniform (every number occurs in zero sets). Given two uniform coverings, we define a new uniform covering, their *sum* (denoted by oplus ), by adding the sets from both coverings. For example: ({1},{1},{2,3},{3,4},{2,4})oplus({1},{2},{3},{4})= ({1},{1},{1},{2},{3},{4},{2,3},{3,4},{2,4}) A uniform covering is called *noncomposite* if it's not a sum of two uniform coverings. Prove that for any ngeq1 , there are only finitely many noncomposite uniform coverings of 1,2,...,n .","completion":"We will prove the result using induction on ( n ). 1. **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the only uniform covering is ({{1}}), which is trivially non-composite. Hence, the base case is obvious. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that there are only finitely many non-composite uniform coverings of ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ). We need to show that there are only finitely many non-composite uniform coverings of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). For any uniform covering ( S_k ) of the integers ( {1, 2, ldots, k} ), let ( A(S_k) ) denote the number of times each element of ( {1, 2, ldots, k} ) appears, and let ( B(S_k) ) denote the number of not necessarily different subsets contained in ( S_k ). For instance, if ( S_3 = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 3}} ), then ( A(S_3) = 2 ) and ( B(S_3) = 3 ). 3. **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume for contradiction that there exist infinitely many non-composite uniform coverings of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). Note that for each ( k ), there can only be finitely many non-composite uniform coverings ( S_n ) with ( A(S_n) = k ). Thus, we can, for any ( N ), find a non-composite uniform covering ( S_n ) such that ( A(S_n) > N ). 4. **Constructing ( S_{n-1} ):** Pick a very large ( N ) and a non-composite uniform covering ( S_n ) with ( A(S_n) > N ). For now, ignore the number ( n ) completely, and let ( S_{n-1} ) denote the uniform covering we obtain from ( S_n ). Since ( A(S_{n-1}) = A(S_n) > A ), we have that ( S_{n-1} ) must be composite, which means that we can split it into two new uniform coverings ( S^{1}_{n-1} ) and ( S^{2}_{n-1} ). Clearly, ( A(S^1_{n-1}) + A(S^2_{n-1}) = A(S_{n-1}) ). 5. **Continuing the Splitting Process:** Using the induction hypothesis, we can continue this procedure until we are left with uniform coverings ( K^1_{n-1}, K^2_{n-1}, ldots, K^{i}_{n-1} ) such that ( A(K^{j}_{n-1}) leq A ) and ( B(K^{j}_{n-1}) leq B ) for every ( 1 leq j leq i ). We have ( N < A(S_{n-1}) = sum A(K^{j}_{n-1}) leq A cdot i Rightarrow i > frac{N}{A} ). This means that ( i ) is unbounded. 6. **Considering Element ( n ):** Now we return our attention back to element ( n ). Let ( k_j ) denote the number of times ( n ) appears in the uniform covering ( K^{j}_{n-1} ) and let ( m_j = A(K^{j}_{n-1}) ). Let ( K ) be a proper non-empty subset of ( {1, 2, ldots, i} ). If we have ( sum_{j in K} (k_j - m_j) = 0 ), this would mean that we could merge the coverings ( K^{j}_{n-1} ) for ( j in K ) back together and obtain a covering in which ( n ) appears the same number of times as any other element, i.e., a uniform covering. Since ( K neq {1, 2, ldots, i} ) and ( K neq emptyset ), this would contradict the assumption that ( S_n ) originally was non-composite. 7. **Bounding ( k_j ) and ( m_j ):** Clearly, ( k_j ) and ( m_j ) are non-negative integers. Also note that ( m_j leq A ) and that ( n ) can appear at most once for each subset of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ), implying ( k_j leq B ). Create the sequence ( {a} ) given by ( a_j = k_j - m_j ). Note that ( -A leq a_j leq B ). If ( exists j ) such that ( a_j = 0 ), we are clearly done. Thus, we can split the terms into a positive group and a negative group. Let ( C ) be the multiset containing the positive terms and let the sum of its elements be ( c ), while ( D ) is the multiset containing the negative ones with sum of elements equalling ( d ). We have ( c - d = |c| + |d| geq i ) and ( c + d = 0 ), combining this gives ( c geq frac{i}{2} ) and ( d leq frac{-i}{2} ). 8. **Finding Equal Elements in ( C ) and ( D ):** Since the sum of elements in ( C ) and ( D ) is unbounded while the terms of the sequence ( {a} ) are bounded, we have that we can find as many equal elements in each of ( C ) and ( D ) as we need. Hence, we assume that we have at least ( A + B + 1 ) copies of the elements ( c_1 in C ) and ( d_1 in D ). We have ( |d_1| leq A ) and ( |c_1| leq B ), implying that we can choose ( -d_1 ) copies of ( c_1 ) and ( c_1 ) copies of ( d_1 ) to obtain ( (-d_1)c_1 + d_1c_1 = 0 ). Clearly, we have at least one copy of each element left, ensuring that we chose a proper subsequence of ( {a} ). In addition, we have ( |c_1| + |d_1| > 0 ), meaning that the subsequence we chose was non-empty. Hence, the induction hypothesis is proven, and we conclude that for any ( n geq 1 ), there are only finitely many non-composite uniform coverings of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ).

When we color the chessboard in a standard way, we have an alternating pattern of black and white squares such that no two adjacent squares have the same color. 2.

Suppose the centaur starts its tour on a white square and makes the first move as a pawn, moving upward to a black square. 4. On the next move made by the centaur, which will be as a knight, it will move from the black square to a white square. 5. Therefore, a pattern develops where the centaur always moves from a white square to a black square when moving as a pawn and from a black square to a white square when moving as a knight. 6. Consider the initial and final row (8th row): - The starting square is white (by assumption), therefore after moving upwards as a pawn, the centaur will always be on a black square in any given row. - However, in the 8th row of the chessboard, there exist black squares. Since the centaur moves upward only (based on the pawn-like movement rules), it cannot start on a black square, meaning it cannot meet the requirement to move across all squares exactly once. 7.

Consider four people ( A, B, C, D ). If ( (A, B), (B, C), (C, D) ) shook hands, then one of ( (A, C), (A, D), (B, D) ) must have shaken hands.

By the inductive hypothesis, the remaining ( n-1 ) vertices can be divided into two groups such that the condition holds. - **Case I: The remaining graph ( G' ) is not connected.** If ( G' ) is not connected, it decomposes into two connected components ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ).

Let O be the point of intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral ABCD. 2. Without loss of generality, we can consider alpha = angle AOB < 90^circ. 3. Drop perpendiculars from the vertices A, B, C, D onto the diagonals of the quadrilateral, denoted as AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, and DD_1 respectively. 4. Now, note that the following lengths are established using trigonometry: [ OA_1 = OA cos alpha ] [ OB_1 = OB cos alpha ] [ OC_1 = OC cos alpha ] [ OD_1 = OD cos alpha ] 5. Given that A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1 are the feet of the perpendiculars from A, B, C, and D to the diagonals, these points lie on the diagonals of the quadrilateral ABCD. 6. Now, let's consider a reflection of the quadrilateral ABCD with respect to the angle bisector of angle AOB. This reflection would map quadrilateral ABCD to another quadrilateral within the same plane, leading us to the quadrilateral A_1B_1C_1D_1. 7. Since each point A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1 is defined as a corresponding perpendicular foot of A, B, C, and D, which subsequently implies the sides are scaled versions relative to A, B, C, and D: [ A_1B_1 = AB cos alpha ] [ B_1C_1 = BC cos alpha ] [ C_1D_1 = CD cos alpha ] [ D_1A_1 = DA cos alpha ] 8.

The relationship between the volume of water (V) and the volume of ice (W) can be determined using the law of conservation of mass: V cdot rho_{text{water}} = W cdot rho_{text{ice}} where rho_{text{water}} is the density of water and rho_{text{ice}} is the density of ice. 2. **Calculate Volume of Ice from Volume of Water**: We know that ice has a lower density than water, which means its volume increases upon freezing. Let us rearrange the equation to solve for W: W = frac{V cdot rho_{text{water}}}{rho_{text{ice}}} 3. **Determine Submerged Volume of Ice**: When the ice is placed back into the water, it will float. According to Archimedes' principle, the volume of the ice submerged in water is equal to the volume of water displaced by the ice. Let U be the submerged volume of the ice. The buoyancy condition provides: U cdot rho_{text{water}} = W cdot rho_{text{ice}} Substituting the expression for W: U cdot rho_{text{water}} = frac{V cdot rho_{text{water}}}{rho_{text{ice}}} cdot rho_{text{ice}} = V cdot rho_{text{water}} Simplifying, we find: U = V This indicates that the volume of water displaced by the ice (U) is equal to the original volume of water placed in the trays (V). 4. **Conclusion**: Since U = V, when the ice melts, it converts back into water of the same volume V. The water level in the glass will therefore return to its initial level, which is exactly at the edge of the glass. Therefore, neither Gavrila nor Glafira is correct.

Note that for ( n geq N ), ( f(1/n) = C_n/n ) for some ( |C_n| leq K ). - Consider the difference: [ left| fleft(frac{1}{n}right) - fleft(frac{1}{n+1}right) right| = left| frac{C_n}{n} - frac{C_{n+1}}{n+1} right| ] - Using the Lipschitz condition: [ frac{K}{n(n+1)} geq left| frac{C_n}{n} - frac{C_{n+1}}{n+1} right| geq frac{|C_n - C_{n+1}|}{n} - frac{|C_{n+1}|}{n(n+1)} ] - Simplifying, we get: [ frac{2K}{n+1} geq |C_n - C_{n+1}| ] - Since ( n+1 geq 8K + 1001 > 2K ), it follows that ( C_n = C_{n+1} ). Thus, ( C = C_N = C_{N+1} = cdots ) for some constant ( C ). - Now, call ( r ) *valid* if ( f(r) = Cr ). We know that ( frac{1}{N}, frac{1}{N+1}, ldots ) are valid. We will show all ( r = frac{a}{b} leq varepsilon ) are valid by induction on ( a ) ( ( a = 1 ) is clear). - Suppose ( r = frac{a}{b} leq varepsilon ) for ( a geq 2 ). Let ( c ) be minimal such that ( frac{a-1}{c} leq frac{a}{b} ), i.e., [ c = leftlceil b cdot frac{a-1}{a} rightrceil leq b ] and [ b leq frac{a}{a-1} cdot c leq 2c ] - Since ( s = frac{a-1}{c} leq r leq varepsilon ), ( s ) is good by induction. On the other hand, [ r - s leq frac{a-1}{c-1} - frac{a-1}{c} = frac{a-1}{c(c-1)} leq frac{a}{c^2} ] - If ( f(r) = frac{t}{b} ), then [ K|r-s| geq |f(r) - f(s)| geq frac{|aC - t|}{b} - C|r-s| ] - Thus, [ |aC - t| leq 2bK|r-s| leq frac{2abK}{c^2} leq frac{4aK}{c} ] - Since ( frac{a}{c} leq frac{2(a-1)}{c} leq 2varepsilon ), [ |aC - t| leq 8Kvarepsilon < 1 ] - Therefore, ( t = aC ) indeed. Thus, ( f(r) = Cr ) for all rationals in ( [0, varepsilon] ), which by density implies that ( f ) is linear on ( [0, varepsilon] ). 2. **Lemma 2: Let ( r = frac{a}{b} ) be rational. Then, ( f ) is linear on ( left[r, r + frac{varepsilon}{b}right] ) and ( left[r - frac{varepsilon}{b}, rright] )** *Proof:* - By symmetry, we will show that ( f ) is linear on the first interval. Define [ g(x) = bf(x-r) ] - This function ( g ) is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant ( bK ) and satisfies the other condition as well. By following the argument above, we get that ( g ) is linear on ( [0, (8bK + 1000)^{-1}] ), and [ frac{1}{8bK + 1000} geq frac{varepsilon}{b} ] 3. **Lemma 3: Let ( 0 < x < 1 ) be arbitrary. Then, ( f ) is linear on ( [x, x - varepsilon_x] ) and ( [x, x + varepsilon_x] ) for some ( varepsilon_x > 0 )** *Proof:* - If ( x ) is rational, we are done by the above lemma. Otherwise, we claim there is a rational ( r = frac{a}{b} ) such that [ |x - r| < frac{varepsilon}{b} ] - We can take rational approximations of ( x ) that are within ( O(b^{-2}) ). 4. **Conclusion:** - Call an open set ( A subset [0,1] ) *allowable* if ( f ) is piecewise linear on ( A ) with at most two pieces. It is clear that ( [0, 1] ) can be covered with allowable sets, namely ( [0, varepsilon/2) ), ( (1 - varepsilon/2, 1] ), and ( (x - varepsilon_x/2, x + varepsilon_x/2) ). - Taking a finite subcover, and invoking the fact that each allowable set is the union of at most 2 intervals on which ( f ) is linear, we conclude that ( [0, 1] ) is the union of some intervals, on each of which ( f ) is linear.

Therefore, the number of piles increases by 1 after each move. 3. **Calculate Total Number of Moves Until No Move is Possible**: - Initially, there are 3 piles. - The game continues until no pile can be split further. This happens when all piles consist of only 1 stone. - If we denote the total number of final piles by ( n_f ), then ( n_f ) must be the total number of 1-stone piles, which, after all splits, must account for every individual stone.

Substituting P(sqrt{2},1) into the equation gives 2m + n = 1. 2. Substituting Q(0,-sqrt{2}) into the equation gives 2n = 1. Solving the system of equations: - From 2n = 1, we find n = frac{1}{2}. - Substituting n = frac{1}{2} into 2m + n = 1 gives 2m + frac{1}{2} = 1, leading to 2m = frac{1}{2}, so m = frac{1}{4}.

Now we will detail the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the conclusion: 1. **Position of (A):** - (A) is the shortest among the tallest students in each longitudinal row. Thus, in the row of 10 students where (A) is the tallest, (A) is guaranteed not to be shorter than any student in the same row. Therefore, (A) is taller than or equal to all students in its row. 2. **Position of (B):** - (B) is the tallest among the shortest students in each transverse row. Thus, in the column of 20 students where (B) is the shortest, (B) is guaranteed not to be taller than any student in the same column. Therefore, (B) is shorter or equal to all students in its column. 3. **Position of (C):** - Student (C) stands at the intersection where the longitudinal row of (A) meets the transverse row of (B). 4. **Comparative Heights:** - Since (A) is the shortest among the tallest in its longitudinal row, no student in this row, including (C), is taller than (A). Therefore, (C) ≤ (A). - Since (B) is the tallest among the shortest in its transverse row, no student in this row, including (C), is shorter than (B). Therefore, (B) ≤ (C).

Now, since a is twice as fast as b, the rate at which a works, ( R_a ), is ( 2 times R_b ). Therefore, ( R_a = 2 times frac{1}{30} = frac{1}{15} ) work per day. When a and b work together, their combined rate, ( R_{a+b} ), is the sum of their individual rates. So, ( R_{a+b} = R_a + R_b = frac{1}{15} + frac{1}{30} ).

After (n) such operations, the circle has a new circumference: - (6n - 2n = 4n) - The remaining (4n) points alternate between black and white. 9. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** - In the resulting circle with alternate black and white points, opposite points always have the same color. - Therefore, there must exist diametrically opposite black points. By the assumption for contradiction that there are no diametrically opposite black points, we reach a contradiction in the final situation.

We need to prove that there are infinitely many primes which divide at least one term of the sequence. 2. **Initial Observations:** - Since (a_n < a_{n+1}), the sequence ((a_n)) is strictly increasing. - The condition (a_{n+1} leq a_n + a) implies that the difference between consecutive terms is bounded by (a). 3. **Bounding the Sequence:** - Let (a_1) be the first term of the sequence. - For any (n geq 1), we have: [ a_{n+1} leq a_n + a ] By iterating this inequality, we get: [ a_{n+1} leq a_1 + na ] This shows that (a_n) grows at most linearly with (n). 4. **Prime Divisors:** - Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes dividing the terms of the sequence.

Specifically, the increase in the exponents (e_{n,i}) must be controlled. 6. **Contradiction:** - If the sequence ((a_n)) were composed of only finitely many primes, the growth condition (a_{n+1} leq a_n + a) would eventually force the sequence to stabilize, contradicting the fact that (a_n) is strictly increasing. - Therefore, our assumption that only finitely many primes divide the terms of the sequence must be false. 7. **Conclusion:** - Hence, there must be infinitely many primes dividing at least one term of the sequence.

This choice simplifies calculations and provides an appropriate counterexample for demonstration purposes. 4. **Analyzing the Reflections**: Let's verify if the reflections of triangle (ABC) through the perpendicular bisectors result in a congruent triangle (A'B'C'): - The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of (ABC) must reflect points (A), (B), (C) to points (A'), (B'), (C') such that the new triangle (A'B'C') is congruent to (ABC) but not in the same orientation or has the same order of vertices. 5. **Steps of Reflection**: - Reflect (A) across the perpendicular bisector of (BC): - This reflection would place (A) at a point (A_1) such that (A_1) is symmetrically opposite to (A) with respect to the midpoint of (BC). - Reflect this new point (A_1) across the perpendicular bisector of (CA): - (A_1) upon reflection over the perpendicular bisector of (CA) results in the point (A'). - Similarly: - Reflect (B) across the perpendicular bisector of (CA) and then reflect the resulting point across the perpendicular bisector of (AB) to obtain (B'). - Reflect (C) across the perpendicular bisector of (AB) and then reflect the resulting point across the perpendicular bisector of (BC) to obtain (C'). 6. **Verification**: - From symmetric properties, we observe that every reflection results in maintaining the congruence due to the triangle's properties (isosceles right triangle here for simplicity), confirming that the resulting triangle (A'B'C') is indeed congruent to (ABC). - **Important Observation**: By choosing an isosceles right triangle, we ensure that the reflection properties hold, demonstrating that the triangles are congruent but (ABC) is not equilateral. 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, it is shown with this specific example that the triangle (ABC) being congruent to (A'B'C') does not necessarily imply that (ABC) is an equilateral triangle. It can have other forms, such as an isosceles right triangle, which satisfies the given conditions but is not equilateral.

It turned out that the number of valentines was 36 more than the total number of students. How many valentines were given?","completion":"To determine the number of valentines given in the school, we follow these steps: 1. **Define Variables:** Let ( x ) be the number of boys and ( y ) be the number of girls in the school. 2. **Relationship Between Variables:** Each boy gives a valentine to each girl, resulting in ( x cdot y ) valentines. According to the problem, this number is 36 more than the total number of students in the school, which is ( x + y ). Therefore, the equation is: [ x cdot y = x + y + 36 ] 3. **Rearrange the Equation:** To simplify the equation, we can move all terms to one side: [ x cdot y - x - y = 36 ] Adding 1 to both sides gives: [ x cdot y - x - y + 1 = 36 + 1 ] which can be rewritten as: [ (x - 1)(y - 1) = 37 ] 4. **Solve for ( x ) and ( y ):** Notice that 37 is a prime number, so it has only two positive integer factors: 1 and 37. Therefore, the possible pairs ((x-1)) and ((y-1)) are: [ (x - 1, y - 1) = (1, 37) quad text{or} quad (x - 1, y - 1) = (37, 1) ] 5. **Determine ( x ) and ( y ):** From these pairs, we get: - ( x - 1 = 1 ) and ( y - 1 = 37 ), which gives ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 38 ) - or ( x - 1 = 37 ) and ( y - 1 = 1 ), which gives ( x = 38 ) and ( y = 2 ) 6. **Calculate the Number of Valentines:** In both cases, the total number of valentines given is: [ x cdot y = 2 cdot 38 = 76 ] or [ x cdot y = 38 cdot 2 = 76 ] # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of valentines given in the school is (boxed{76})."},{"prompt":"(1) Calculate: {(frac{27}{8})}^{frac{2}{3}}+{π}^{lg1}+log_{2}frac{2}{3}log_{4}frac{16}{9}; (2) Given {a}^{frac{1}{2}}+{a}^{frac{1}{2}}=3, find the value of frac{{a}^{3}+{a}^{3}}{a+{a}^{1}}.","completion":"Let's break down the solution step by step, adhering to the requirements: **Problem 1:** 1. We start with the expression {(frac{27}{8})}^{-frac{2}{3}}+{π}^{lg1}+log_{2}frac{2}{3}-log_{4}frac{16}{9}. 2. We can simplify each term as follows: - {(frac{27}{8})}^{-frac{2}{3}} becomes {(frac{2}{3})}^{3×frac{2}{3}} because (frac{27}{8})^{-frac{2}{3}} is equivalent to (frac{3}{2})^{-2} and then flipping the fraction gives us (frac{2}{3})^{2}. - {π}^{lg1} simplifies to {π}^{0} because lg1 = 0, thus any number to the power of 0 is 1. - log_{2}frac{2}{3} stays as is for now. - log_{4}frac{16}{9} converts to log_{2}frac{4}{3} because converting the base from 4 to 2 involves changing the argument from frac{16}{9} to its square root, which is frac{4}{3}. 3. So, we have {(frac{2}{3})}^{2}+1+log_{2}frac{2}{3}-log_{2}frac{4}{3}. 4. Next, log_{2}frac{2}{3}-log_{2}frac{4}{3} simplifies to log_{2}(frac{2}{3}×frac{3}{4}) due to the properties of logarithms, where log_{a}x-log_{a}y=log_{a}(frac{x}{y}). 5. Therefore, the expression simplifies further to frac{4}{9}+1-1. 6. The final answer is frac{4}{9}. So, the step-by-step solution for (1) is boxed{frac{4}{9}}. **Problem 2:** 1. We are given that {a}^{frac{1}{2}}+{a}^{-frac{1}{2}}=3. 2. Squaring both sides gives us a+2+{a}^{-1}=9 Rightarrow a+{a}^{-1}=7 because (a^{frac{1}{2}})^2=a, (a^{-frac{1}{2}})^2=a^{-1}, and the middle term comes from the product of 2(a^{frac{1}{2}})(a^{-frac{1}{2}})=2. 3. Now, we need to find a^{2}+a^{-2}, which is (a+a^{-1})^{2}-2=47, because (a+a^{-1})^2=a^2+2+(a^{-1})^2. 4. Finally, we calculate frac{{a}^{3}+{a}^{-3}}{a+{a}^{-1}}. Since we know a+{a}^{-1}=7 and a^{2}+a^{-2}=47, we can express {a}^{3}+{a}^{-3} as (a+{a}^{-1})(a^{2}+a^{-2}-1). 5. Therefore, frac{{a}^{3}+{a}^{-3}}{a+{a}^{-1}}=frac{7(47-1)}{7}=46.

The derivative is given by: [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(xln x) - frac{d}{dx}(mx^{2}) = 1 + ln x - 2mx.] **Step 2: Analyze Statement A** For f(x) to be strictly decreasing, f'(x) leq 0 for all x > 0. This implies: [2m geq frac{1 + ln x}{x}.] Let g(x) = frac{1 + ln x}{x} for x > 0, and find its derivative: [g'(x) = frac{-ln x}{x^2}.] For x in (0,1), g'(x) > 0, making g(x) increasing, and for x in (1, +infty), g'(x) < 0, making g(x) decreasing. Thus, g(x) reaches its maximum at x = 1, where g(1) = 1. This implies 2m geq 1, or m geq frac{1}{2}. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Step 3: Analyze Statement B** From the analysis in step 2, when m = frac{1}{2}, f(x) is strictly decreasing and does not have any extremum points. Thus, statement B is incorrect. **Step 4: Analyze Statement C** When m = frac{1}{e}, we have f(x) = xln x - frac{1}{e}x^{2}. At x = e, f(e) = 0 and f'(x) = 1 + ln x - frac{2}{e}x. Also, f'(e) = 0, indicating that the tangent line to the graph of f(x) at (e,0) is y = 0, which is the x-axis. Therefore, statement C is correct. **Step 5: Analyze Statement D** For f(x) = 0, we have ln x - mx = 0. Let h(x) = ln x - mx, with h'(x) = frac{1}{x} - m. When m leq 0, h'(x) > 0, making h(x) monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). For m = 0, h(1) = 0. For m < 0, h(e^{m}) = m(1 - e^{m}) < 0 and h(1) = -m > 0, indicating exactly one zero point. When m > 0, the function h(x) has a maximum at x = frac{1}{m}, where h(x)_{max} = -ln m - 1. The function f(x) has only one zero point when -ln m - 1 = 0, giving m = frac{1}{e}.

Prove that there are more than two good vertices.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to prove that in a convex polygon partitioned into parallelograms, there are more than two vertices that belong to exactly one parallelogram (good vertices). 2. **Lemma:** We start by considering the angles formed by the sides of the polygon and the parallelograms. Let the two marked angles be alpha and beta. Since the parallelograms are non-intersecting, the sum of the angles at any vertex of the polygon must be at least 180^circ. 3. **Angle Sum Analysis:** For a convex n-gon, the sum of the interior angles is given by: [ 180(n-2) text{ degrees} ] If we assume there are only two good vertices, then the remaining n-2 vertices must each belong to at least two parallelograms. 4. **Contradiction Setup:** Assume for contradiction that there are only two good vertices.

Summing these angles for all n vertices, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} text{angle}_i geq 180n ] However, this sum includes the angles at the good vertices twice, so we need to subtract the excess. 5. **Overcounting Adjustment:** The sum of the interior angles of the n-gon is: [ 180(n-2) text{ degrees} ] If we subtract the sum of the angles at the good vertices (which is less than 360^circ), we get: [ 180n - text{sum of angles at good vertices} > 180(n-2) ] This implies: [ 180n - text{sum of angles at good vertices} > 180n - 360 ] Simplifying, we get: [ text{sum of angles at good vertices} < 360 ] This is a contradiction because the sum of the angles at the good vertices should be exactly 360^circ if there are only two good vertices. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our assumption that there are only two good vertices must be false.

First, we know that: 1. f(sqrt{2}) = a by our definition. Since f(xy) = f(x) + f(y), applying this property, we get: 2. f(2) = f(sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2}) = f(sqrt{2}) + f(sqrt{2}) = 2a.

Suppose ( a ) gives a remainder ( t ) when divided by both 11 and 12. This implies: [ a = t + 11k = t + 12m quad text{for some integers } k text{ and } m ] 4. Rearrange terms to form a congruence: [ t + 11k = t + 12m implies 11k = 12m implies 11k - 12m = 0 ] 5. The above congruence signifies that the difference ( 11k ) and ( 12m ) must be multiples of the least common multiple of 11 and 12, which is ( 132 ). Thus, set: [ k = 12s quad text{and} quad m = 11s quad text{for an integer } s ] 6. Substitute back into the expression for ( a ): [ a = t + 11k = t + 11(12s) = t + 132s ] 7. We need ( a ) to be in the range ([1, 1000]): [ 1 leq t + 132s leq 1000 ] 8. For each value of ( t in {0, 1, ldots, 10} ), solve for ( s ): - ( t = 0: 132s leq 1000 implies s leq frac{1000}{132} approx 7.57 implies s leq 7 ) (This means there are ( 8 ) values of ( s ): ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )) - ( t = 1: 1 + 132s leq 1000 implies s leq frac{999}{132} approx 7.57 implies s leq 7 ) (There are ( 8 ) values of ( s ): ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )) - ( t = 2: 2 + 132s leq 1000 implies s leq frac{998}{132} approx 7.56 implies s leq 7 ) (There are ( 8 ) values of ( s ): ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )) - Continue this pattern until ( t = 10 ): [ t = 10: 10 + 132s leq 1000 implies s leq frac{990}{132} approx 7.5 implies s leq 7 ] (There are ( 8 ) values of ( s ): ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )) 9. Therefore, for each ( t in {1, 2, ldots, 10} ) there are ( 8 ) possible values of ( s ), and for ( t = 0 ), there are ( 7 ) values. 10.

Let a_{2015} be replaced by a_0 and a_{2016} by a_1. This does not affect the properties of the sequence since a shift does not change its polynomial form. 3. Suppose a_0 = p^2 and a_1 = q^2, where p and q are integers. This means at n=0, the sequence value is a perfect square and similarly at n=1. 4.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 52 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 52 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 52000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 14.44 (rounded to two decimal places) Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the distance covered by the train while crossing the platform. Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 14.44 m/s * 18 seconds Distance = 259.92 meters The distance covered is the sum of the length of the train (let's call it L) and the length of the platform (280 meters). L + 280 meters = 259.92 meters To find the length of the train (L), we subtract the length of the platform from the total distance covered: L = 259.92 meters - 280 meters L = -20.08 meters This result doesn't make sense because the length of the train cannot be negative. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-calculate the distance covered by the train: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 14.44 m/s * 18 seconds Distance = 259.92 meters The distance covered should be greater than the length of the platform since the train has to cross the entire platform. Let's correct the calculation: L + 280 meters = 259.92 meters + 280 meters L + 280 meters = 539.92 meters Now we can find the length of the train (L): L = 539.92 meters - 280 meters L = 259.92 meters Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{259.92} meters."},{"prompt":"Robert's salary was decreased by a certain percentage and subsequently increased by the same percentage.

When his salary is decreased by x%, his new salary becomes S - (x/100) * S. When this new salary is increased by x%, it becomes (S - (x/100) * S) + x% of (S - (x/100) * S), which is: (S - (x/100) * S) * (1 + (x/100)) Expanding this, we get: S * (1 - (x/100)) * (1 + (x/100)) This simplifies to: S * (1 - (x/100)^2) We know that after the decrease and subsequent increase, Robert lost 9% of his salary. So, his final salary is 91% of his original salary (100% - 9% = 91%). So we can set up the equation: S * (1 - (x/100)^2) = S * 0.91 Dividing both sides by S, we get: 1 - (x/100)^2 = 0.91 Now, we solve for x: (x/100)^2 = 1 - 0.91 (x/100)^2 = 0.09 Taking the square root of both sides: x/100 = √0.09 x = 100 * √0.09 x = 100 * 0.3 x = 30 So, the percentage of the decrease and subsequent increase was boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"For the quadratic function y=ax^{2}+bx+c(a,b are constants, and aneq 0), some corresponding values of the independent variable x and the function value y are shown in the table below: | x | ldots | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ldots | |||||||| | y | ldots | m | 2 | 2 | n | ldots | It is known that when x=frac{3}{2}, the corresponding function value y lt 0.

The correct conclusions are ( ). A: ②③ B: ③④ C: ②③④ D: ①②③④","completion":"Given the quadratic function y=ax^{2}+bx+c where a, b, and c are constants, and aneq 0, we have a table of values for x and y as follows: - When x=0, y=c=2. - When x=1, substituting into the quadratic equation gives a(1)^2+b(1)+c=2, which simplifies to a+b+c=2. Since we know c=2, we can deduce that a+b=0. This means that abc=acdot bcdot 2. Without the specific values of a and b, we cannot determine the sign of abc directly, but we will revisit this after analyzing the shape and orientation of the parabola. The axis of symmetry of a parabola given by y=ax^2+bx+c is at x=-frac{b}{2a}. Given that the function values at x=0 and x=1 are the same, the axis of symmetry must be equidistant from these points, thus x=frac{1}{2}. This implies that the parabola is symmetric about x=frac{1}{2}. Given that y<0 when x=frac{3}{2}, the parabola must open downwards, indicating that a<0. This affects the behavior of the function as follows: - When xleqslant 0, since the vertex is to the right of this region and the parabola opens downwards, y increases as x increases. Hence, conclusion ② is correct. - The fact that y<0 for x=frac{3}{2} and y=2 for x=1 means there must be at least one root between x=1 and x=frac{3}{2}. Given the axis of symmetry and the downward opening, there must be another root on the opposite side of the axis, between -frac{1}{2} and 0. This validates conclusion ③. Since -frac{b}{2a}=frac{1}{2}, we have b=-a. Substituting b=-a into the quadratic equation gives y=ax^{2}-ax+2. For x=-1 and x=2, we find that m=n=2a+2. Therefore, 3m-n=6a+6-2a-2=4a+4. Given that y<0 when x=frac{3}{2}, substituting x=frac{3}{2} into y=ax^{2}-ax+2 gives frac{9}{4}a-frac{3}{2}a+2<0, which simplifies to a<-frac{8}{3}. This implies that 3m-n=4a+4<-frac{20}{3}, confirming conclusion ④. Since a<0 and b=-a, abc=2a(-a)=2a^2>0 only if aneq 0. However, the sign of abc depends on the specific values of a and b, which we deduced as a<0 and b=-a. Given a<0, abc actually becomes 2a^2>0, contradicting the initial incorrect assumption that abc<0 based on insufficient information. Thus, ① is incorrect due to the misunderstanding of the sign of a.

Let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Analyzing a_{9} < 0 and a_{1} + a_{18} > 0:** In an arithmetic sequence, the sum of equidistant terms from the beginning and the end is constant. Therefore, a_{1} + a_{18} = a_{9} + a_{10}. Given that a_{1} + a_{18} > 0, we can infer that a_{9} + a_{10} > 0. 2. **Determining the sign of a_{10}:** Since a_{9} < 0 and a_{9} + a_{10} > 0, we can deduce that a_{10} > 0. This directly implies that option B is correct. 3. **Checking the validity of option A:** Given that a_{9} < 0 and the sequence is arithmetic (implying a constant difference), the sign of a_{1} cannot be determined directly from a_{9} < 0 alone without knowing the common difference. However, the initial conclusion that a_{1} + a_{18} > 0 does not necessarily imply a_{1} > 0 directly, especially without additional context on the sequence's progression. Thus, stating a_{1} < 0 as a direct conclusion is incorrect without further clarification. The correct approach should focus on the information directly related to the options provided. 4. **Evaluating S_{9}:** Since a_{9} < 0 and it's part of the sum S_{9} = a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{9}, without knowing the signs of all preceding terms, we cannot conclusively determine S_{9} < 0 solely based on a_{9} < 0. The statement about S_{9} being less than 0 requires the assumption that the sum of the first 8 terms is not enough to offset a_{9}'s negativity, which isn't provided in the initial information. 5. **Determining the minimum value of S_{n}:** The statement that S_{n} is minimum when n=9 based on a_{9} < 0 and a_{10} > 0 is an oversimplification. The minimum value of S_{n} depends on the entire sequence's behavior rather than the comparison of two terms. Without additional information on the sequence's progression and the sum of its terms, this conclusion is speculative. Given the above analysis, the correct interpretation focuses on the validity of option B: a_{10} > 0, which is directly supported by the given information.

The number of bishops will be equivalent to the number of independent black-squared diagonals: - These diagonals are {d_1, d_2, ..., d_7}. 6. **Maximum Possible Black-Square Bishops**: - A board partition shows that seven \\"black-square\\" bishops can be correctly placed across seven diagonals without them threatening each other.

Hence, [ f(n) = frac{1}{3} sum_{j=0}^2 (1 - omega^j)^n . ] 10. We decompose the sum over j: [ f(n) = frac{1}{3} left( (1 - omega)^n + (1 - bar{omega})^n + (1 - 1)^n right). ] Here, (1 - 1)^n = 0^n which is 0 for n geq 1. Thus, [ f(n) = frac{1}{3} left( (1 - omega)^n + (1 - bar{omega})^n right). ] 11. Now we need to express (1 - omega)^n and (1 - bar{omega})^n: [ (1 - omega)^n = left( frac{3 - sqrt{3} i}{2} right)^n = (sqrt{3})^n left( cosleft( frac{pi}{6} right) - i sinleft( frac{pi}{6} right) right)^n . ] Similarly, [ (1 - bar{omega})^n = left( frac{3 + sqrt{3} i}{2} right)^n = (sqrt{3})^n left( cosleft( frac{pi}{6} right) + i sinleft( frac{pi}{6} right) right)^n . ] 12. Apply Euler's formula: [ (cos theta - i sin theta)^n = cos(n theta) - i sin(n theta) , ] and [ (cos theta + i sin theta)^n = cos(n theta) + i sin(n theta) . ] 13. Therefore, [ (1 - omega)^n = (sqrt{3})^n left( cosleft( frac{n pi}{6} right) - i sinleft( frac{n pi}{6} right) right), ] and [ (1 - bar{omega})^n = (sqrt{3})^n left( cosleft( frac{n pi}{6} right) + i sinleft( frac{n pi}{6} right) right). ] 14. Adding these yields, [ (1 - omega)^n + (1 - bar{omega})^n = 2 (sqrt{3})^n cosleft( frac{n pi}{6} right) . ] 15. Hence, [ f(n) = frac{1}{3} left( 2 (sqrt{3})^n cosleft( frac{n pi}{6} right) right) = frac{2}{3} (sqrt{3})^n cosleft( frac{n pi}{6} right). ] 16.

Is it always possible to find a group of 4 clans, each of which is in conflict with every other clan in the group? To determine whether there is always a group of 4 clans that are mutually antagonistic (each clan in the group is in conflict with every other clan in the group), we can utilize the properties of graph theory. 1. **Restate the Problem in Graph-Theoretical Terms**: - Represent each clan as a vertex in a graph. - Draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding clans are in conflict. - We need to demonstrate whether this graph must always contain a complete subgraph K_4 (i.e., a set of 4 vertices each connected to each other). 2. **Analyze Degree of Vertices**: - According to the problem, each clan is in conflict with at least 14 other clans. - In graph terminology, each vertex has a degree of at least 14. 3. **Apply Turán's Theorem**: - Turán’s theorem states that if a graph has ( n ) vertices and more than [ left(1 - frac{1}{k-1}right) frac{n^2}{2} ] edges, then it must contain a complete subgraph ( K_k ). - Here, ( k = 4 ) and ( n = 20 ). - Substitute these values into the Turán’s theorem inequality: [ e > left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) frac{20^2}{2} = frac{2}{3} cdot 200 = frac{400}{3} approx 133.33 ] Therefore, if our graph has more than 133 edges, it must contain a ( K_4 ). 4. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Edges**: - Each vertex has a degree of at least 14. - The sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least ( 20 times 14 = 280 ), considering each edge is counted twice, so the number of edges ( e ) is given by: [ 2e geq 280 implies e geq 140 ] - The number of edges is 140 which is greater than 133.33. 5. **Conclusion**: - By Turán's theorem, a graph with 20 vertices and at least 140 edges must contain a complete subgraph ( K_4 ). - Hence, there is definitely a set of 4 clans, each in conflict with each other.

Denote the angular measure of this arc by (alpha'). 2. **Central Angle Theorem**: - According to the Central Angle Theorem in circle geometry, the central angle subtending a given arc is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. - Triangle (ABC) is an equilateral triangle, so the angle (angle BAC) is (60^circ). 3. **Relationship Between Angles (alpha) and (alpha')**: - The arc intercepted by segments (AB) and (AC) forms an angle at the center of the circle equal to (alpha + alpha'). - Since both arcs are part of the same triangle and the triangle is regular, the arcs are symmetrical with respect to the line passing through the center of the circle parallel to side (BC).

The diameter ( AA_0 ) intersects the circumcircle again at ( A_0 ). 2. **Right angles and circle properties:** The segment ( DA_0 ), where ( D ) lies on ( BC ) (either on ( BC ) or its extension), subtends a right angle at ( E ) on the circumcircle, by virtue of the Thales' theorem. Consequently, circle ( k_d ) with diameter ( DA_0 ) will pass through both ( E ) and the midpoint ( F ) of ( BC ). 3. **Secant-Tangent theorem application:** Since ( A ) to ( D ) and ( A ) to ( A_0 ) are secants of circle ( k_d ), AD cdot AE = AF cdot AA_0 = AB^2 = c^2. 4. **Setting up the equation:** Let the smaller segment among ( AD ) and ( AF ) be denoted as ( x ).

Note that ( M = {2} ) is a valid solution because ( f(2, 2) = 2 ). 3. **Step 2: Considering Another Even Number:** Suppose ( M ) contains another even number. Let ( 2m ) be the smallest even number in ( M ) with ( m geq 2 ). Then calculate ( f(2m, 2) ): [ f(2m, 2) = frac{2m + 2}{operatorname{ggT}(2m, 2)} = frac{2(m + 1)}{2} = m + 1 ] ( m + 1 in M ). Because ( 2 < m + 1 < 2m ) and by the minimality of ( m ), ( m+1 ) must be odd. Thus, ( M ) contains an odd element. 4. **Step 3: Odd Elements Implication:** Suppose ( u in M ) is odd. Then calculate ( f(u, 2) ): [ f(u, 2) = frac{u + 2}{operatorname{ggT}(u, 2)} = frac{u + 2}{1} = u + 2 ] Therefore, ( u + 2 in M ).

Since (angle AOB) is the external angle of (triangle AOD) with respect to the vertex (O) and (AO = OD) (due to symmetry in isosceles trapezoid), it follows that: [ angle CAD = frac{alpha}{2} ] 3. **Height Calculation**: Let (CK = H) be the height of the trapezoid.

This matches our earlier formulation. - **Inductive Step**: - Assume the formula is true for some n = m, i.e., f(m, k) = frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{m-k}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^m}. - Show it is true for n = m+1: f(m+1, k) = frac{1}{2} f(m, k-1) + frac{1}{2} f(m, k+1) By the induction hypothesis: f(m, k-1) = frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{m-(k-1)}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^m} f(m, k+1) = frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{m-(k+1)}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^m} Hence, f(m+1, k) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{m+1-k}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^m} + frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{m+1-(k+1)}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^m} right) = frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{(m+1)-k}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^{m+1}} This confirms that the formula holds for all n. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the probability that Emily's bucket contains exactly 1337 stones after 2017 seconds is: f(2017, 1337) = frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{2017-1337}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^{2017}} = frac{left(leftlfloorfrac{680}{2}rightrfloorright)}{2^{2017}} = frac{340}{2^{2017}} boxed{frac{340}{2^{2017}}}"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],z={key:0},M={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
