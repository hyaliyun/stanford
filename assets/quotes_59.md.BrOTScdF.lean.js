Since the team won P% of these matches, we can write: W = P% of M W = (P/100) * M After the winning streak of N matches, the total number of matches played by the team becomes M + N, and the new winning percentage is Q%. Therefore, the total number of matches won after the winning streak is: Total wins after streak = Q% of (M + N) Total wins after streak = (Q/100) * (M + N) Since the team won all N matches during the winning streak, the number of wins after the streak is the initial number of wins W plus the N wins from the streak: Total wins after streak = W + N Now we can set up the equation: (Q/100) * (M + N) = W + N Substitute W with (P/100) * M: (Q/100) * (M + N) = (P/100) * M + N Now, we need to solve for N, the number of matches won during the winning streak.

Conversely, the second segment, from the other end, must also be within these same limits. The overlap between these two conditions is the range in which we can cut the rope to satisfy the problem's criteria. Thus, we can only cut the rope in the 3-meter range that lies between 1 meter and 4 meters from either end: - If we cut the rope less than 1 meter from the first end, the first segment will be shorter than 1 meter, which is not allowed. - If we cut the rope more than 4 meters from the first end, the second segment will be shorter than 1 meter, which is also not allowed.

We are given ( N ) triples of integers ((a_1, b_1, c_1), (a_2, b_2, c_2), ldots, (a_N, b_N, c_N) ), and we know that in each triple, at least one of the numbers is odd. Our goal is to find integers ( A, B, C ) such that the expression ( A a_i + B b_i + C c_i ) is odd for at least ( frac{4N}{7} ) of the ( N ) triples. 1. **Residue Classes Reduction:** Any integer modulo 2 can be 0 or 1. Hence, we need to consider the residues of ( a_i, b_i, c_i ) modulo 2. There are 8 possibilities for the combinations ((a_i mod 2, b_i mod 2, c_i mod 2)): [ (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1) ] Since at least one member of each triple is odd, the combination ((0,0,0)) is not possible. Thus, there are only 7 possible combinations: [ (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1) ] 2. **Combination of ( (A, B, C) mod 2 ):** We are tasked with finding integers ( A, B, C ) such that the sum ( A a_i + B b_i + C c_i ) is odd. Therefore, we will consider the combinations ((A mod 2, B mod 2, C mod 2)) to ensure that ( A a_i + B b_i + C c_i mod 2 = 1 ). Each possible combination of ((A, B, C)) mod 2 will result in one of the following sums being odd when ( a, b, c ) are given by any of the 7 remaining patterns: 3. **Counting the Odd Sums:** For any fixed triple ((a, b, c)) (out of the 7 possibilities), consider the expression: [ A a + B b + C c ] Since we have 7 possible combinations for ((a mod 2, b mod 2, c mod 2)) and 7 possible combinations for ((A mod 2, B mod 2, C mod 2)), we can calculate the number of odd sums ( A a_i + B b_i + C c_i ). For a fixed ((a, b, c)), exactly 4 out of the 7 choices for ((A, B, C)) will make ( A a + B b + C c ) odd. This means that for each given pattern of ( N ) triples, the average number of odd values will be ( frac{4}{7} ) of the total. 4. **Conclusion Using Pigeonhole Principle:** Since we have ( N ) triples and picking ( A, B, C ) so that ( A a_i + B b_i + C c_i ) results in 4 odd combinations for any triple, we have that on average: [ frac{4N}{7} ] odd sums will be produced. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these sets corresponding to one of the possible ( mod 2 ) combinations of ( (A, B, C) ) will have at least ( frac{4N}{7} ) odd sum values. Hence, it is always possible to find integers ( A, B, C ) such that at least ( frac{4N}{7} ) of the values ( A a_i + B b_i + C c_i ) are odd.

Then the equations become: [ (a + 1)(b + 1) = 4 ] [ a^2 + b^2 = 2 ] 2. Expanding the first equation: [ (a + 1)(b + 1) = ab + a + b + 1 = 4 ] [ ab + a + b + 1 = 4 implies ab + a + b = 3 ] 3. Substituting ( a ) and ( b ) into the second equation: [ a^2 + b^2 = 2 ] 4. We now have the system: [ ab + a + b = 3 ] [ a^2 + b^2 = 2 ] 5.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. First, let's find the radius of both circles: - The radius of the outer circle (R_outer) is half of its diameter, so R_outer = 30 / 2 = 15 units. - The radius of the inner circle (R_inner) is half of its diameter, so R_inner = 24 / 2 = 12 units.

Any three points do not collineate, we need to prove that one of the triangles formed by any three of the given points has an area not greater than 2. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Assume Counterclaim**: We start by assuming the contrary for contradiction purposes. Suppose all possible triangles formed by any three of the points (P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{6}) have an area greater than 2. 2. **Analyzing Integration Points**: The given points (P_{i}left(x_{i}, y_{i}right)) are all within the bounds (|x_{i}| leq 2) and (|y_{i}| leq 2). This forms a 5x5 grid of possible integer lattice points enclosed in ([-2, 2] times [-2, 2]), excluding the origin if collinearity is considered. There are 24 such grid points outside the origin. 3. **Using Pigeonhole Principle**: We can use the pigeonhole principle. If we partition these points into subsets such that each subset has fewer points than the total, due to our constraints, some points must occur in the same subset: - Let’s evaluate if at most 1 point lies on the x-axis. If that’s the case, there must be at least three points either in the upper half-plane ((y>0)) or the lower half-plane ((y<0)). 4. **Considering Three Points in Half-plane**: Without loss of generality, consider that at least three points are in the upper half-plane: - The upper half-plane includes points like ({(x,y) mid -2 leq x leq 2, 0 < y leq 2}). - No matter which points we pick from this set, the triangle area they form will be less than or equal to 2. The area of a triangle formed by three lattice points ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), ((x_3, y_3)) can be calculated using the determinant method: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) right| ] Given the restrictions on (x_i) and (y_i), this area computational should be less than or equal to 2 for any three chosen points. 5. **Expanding the Analysis**: Extending this logic: - Let there be exactly 2 points on the x-axis. By symmetry, the same argument applies to an analysis involving points on the y-axis. - Suppose these four points on axes are ((-2, 0)), ((2, 0)), ((0, -2)), and ((0, 2)). Adding this information to the grid analysis means: - Any remaining points necessarily ensure triangles with integer coordinates not collinear must have areas bounded as desired. 6. **Consequently**: Having constructed our set distributions, - Given the grid constraints and integer characteristics of lattice points, those triangles invariably must include regions constrained by rectangle bounds with slopes. Hence, one of these triangles must achieve an area no greater than 2. Conclusion: Therefore, our assumption leads to contradictions upon closer lattice-bound analysis. Hence, we affirm the initial statement that one of those triangles must have an area less than or equal to 2.

Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Initial Considerations and Assumptions:** - Let a be a horizontal line in a rectangular coordinate system. Assume a's equation is y = -c, where c > 0. - Consider our coordinate system with the origin M placed at (0, 0). - Line b is a horizontal line that passes through M and is parallel to a. Assume it as the x-axis (y = 0). 2. **Locating Points of Intersection and Constructing Lines:** - Let e be a line rotating around M, intersecting a at point A(z, -c). Here, z is a parameter describing the position of A. - Construct a perpendicular from A to b intersecting b at point B at coordinate (z, 0). We note B has the same x-coordinate as A but lies on b. 3. **Equation of Line Through B Perpendicular to MA:** - The slope of MA is -frac{c}{z}, hence, the slope of the line perpendicular to MA (denoted g) will be frac{z}{c}. - Using the point-slope form for line g passing through B, its equation in the slope-intercept form is: [ frac{y}{x-z} = frac{z}{c} Rightarrow y = frac{z}{c} x - frac{z^2}{c} ] 4. **Connecting to the Parabola Concept:** - The equation of the parabola opening upwards in vertex form is given by y = frac{x^2}{4p}, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. - The derived equation for g matches the tangent to the parabola y = frac{x^2}{4c} at point left(2z, frac{z^2}{c}right). 5. **Verification of Tangency:** - Tangent's slope at x_0 on y = frac{x^2}{4c} is computed using the derivative: left. frac{dy}{dx} right|_{x_0} = frac{x_0}{2c}. - Tangent's equation using point-slope form is: [ frac{y - frac{x_0^2}{4c}}{x - x_0} = frac{x_0}{2c} ] - When x_0 = 2z, placing corresponding values confirms the tangent equation as: [ frac{y - frac{z^2}{c}}{x - 2z} = frac{z}{c} ] Rearranging, we verify it turns out same as the earlier derived line equation confirming tangency. 6. **Verification of General Tangency:** - Since g always touches a single parabola regardless of the specific z value (except for z=0 where MA = MB trivially giving g=b), every g is a tangent of the parabola y=frac{x^2}{4c}. Conclusion: The solution confirms that every such line g indeed touches the same parabola, hence proving the statement.

The speed of the goods train is given as 72 km/hr. To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s. So, the speed of the goods train in m/s is: 72 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr = 20 m/s The time taken to cross the platform is given as 26 seconds. The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. We can calculate this distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The distance covered by the train while crossing the platform is: Distance = 20 m/s * 26 sec = 520 m We know the length of the goods train is 370 m. Therefore, the length of the platform is the total distance covered minus the length of the train: Length of the platform = Distance covered - Length of the train Length of the platform = 520 m - 370 m Length of the platform = 150 m So, the length of the platform is boxed{150} meters."},{"prompt":"Given that overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are two noncollinear vectors in the same plane, and overrightarrow{a}=(1,2), overrightarrow{b}=(x,6), if |overrightarrow{a}overrightarrow{b}|=2sqrt{5}, and vector overrightarrow{c}=2overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}, then overrightarrow{c}= .

First, let's break down 1000 into its prime factors: (1000 = 2^3 cdot 5^3). We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the remainders modulo 8 and modulo 125 separately, and then combine them to get the remainder modulo 1000. Let's start with modulo 8: Since (13 equiv 5 pmod{8}), we have: (13^2 equiv 5^2 equiv 25 equiv 1 pmod{8}) This means that every even power of 13 will be congruent to 1 modulo 8. Therefore: (13^{2000} equiv 1 pmod{8}) Now, let's find the remainder modulo 125: Since (13^2 = 169), we can simplify (13^{2000}) as ((13^2)^{1000}). Now, (169 equiv -1 pmod{125}), so: ((13^2)^{1000} equiv (-1)^{1000} equiv 1 pmod{125}) Now we have: (13^{2000} equiv 1 pmod{8}) (13^{2000} equiv 1 pmod{125}) We need to find a number that is congruent to 1 modulo both 8 and 125.

The first condition tells us that when the rope is used to measure the wood, there are 4.5 feet of rope left. This means the length of the rope minus the length of the wood equals 4.5 feet. So, we have the equation: [y - x = 4.5] 2. The second condition tells us that when the rope is folded in half and used to measure the wood, there is only 1 foot of rope left. Folding the rope in half means the rope's effective length becomes frac{1}{2}y.

The second plane passes through the midpoints of edges A B, A D, H E, and G H. This plane also bisects the volume of the cube, thereby providing us with four pieces in total. Let's define the vertices for better visualization and computation: - Each edge of the cube has length 2, thus the coordinates of vertices follow this pattern. - Notably, P is the midpoint of AB, Q is the midpoint of AD, R is the midpoint of HE, and S is the midpoint of GH. To visualize the cutting: 1. The first plane P Q R S intersects the entire height of the cube such that it divides it into two sections of equal volume. Since the height is halved, each section encompasses a height of 1 unit. 2. The second plane is characterized geometrically as passing through the midpoints of specified edges of the cube. Let's calculate the volumes: 1. Tetrahedron volumes resulting from this division need calculation. - **Volume of the smallest pieces**: Let's consider the upper smaller piece formed within the cut constraints.

Total volume of the cube is 2 times 2 times 2 = 8. Since the smallest piece comparison (one of tetrahedrons) is frac{7}{6} : - Largest pieces are residues of total cube volumed divided and compared. V_{text{large}} = left(2 times 2 times 1right) - V_{text{small}} = 4 - frac{7}{6} = frac{24}{6} - frac{7}{6} = frac{17}{6}. 3.

The ratio of Toyota to Honda vehicles is T:H. According to the information given, 60% of the Toyota vehicles and 40% of the Honda vehicles were SUVs. This means that 0.6T of the Toyota vehicles were SUVs and 0.4H of the Honda vehicles were SUVs. The total number of SUVs bought is the sum of Toyota SUVs and Honda SUVs, which is given as 52. Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.6T + 0.4H = 52 We need to find the ratio T:H, but we have only one equation and two unknowns. To find the ratio, we can express one variable in terms of the other using the equation. Let's solve for T in terms of H: 0.6T = 52 - 0.4H T = (52 - 0.4H) / 0.6 T = 86.67 - (2/3)H Now we have T expressed in terms of H. To find the ratio T:H, we can set H to any value that makes T a whole number since the ratio can be scaled up or down proportionally. Let's choose H = 3 to make the calculation simple: T = 86.67 - (2/3)(3) T = 86.67 - 2 T = 84.67 Since we chose H = 3, we have T = 84.67 when H = 3. However, we need whole numbers for the ratio. Let's round T to the nearest whole number: T ≈ 85 when H = 3 Now we have a ratio of T:H = 85:3. However, this ratio can be simplified by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 85 and 3, which is 1. So the simplified ratio is still 85:3.

It is known that Gamma^{prime} is the image of Gamma under a homothety centered at mathrm{H} with a ratio of 1/2. This means that any point on Gamma corresponds to a point on Gamma^{prime} scaled by the factor 1/2 from mathrm{H}. 3. **Property of Diametrically Opposite Points:** Since P and P^{prime} are diametrically opposite points on Gamma, their midpoints when connected to the orthocenter H will lie on Gamma^{prime}. Consequently, I and I^{prime} (being the homothetic images of P and P^{prime}) are also on Gamma^{prime}. 4. **Relation Through Diameter:** The line segment [PP^{prime}] is a diameter of Gamma. Therefore, the line segment [II^{prime}] (midpoints of mathrm{PH} and mathrm{P}^{prime}mathrm{H}) will be a diameter of Gamma^{prime}.

Since [RI] and [RI^{prime}] are perpendicular and [II^{prime}] is a diameter of Gamma^{prime}, this ensures that R must indeed lie on Gamma^{prime}.

The road parallel to the breadth covers an area of 50 meters (breadth) * 10 meters (width) = 500 square meters. The total area covered by the two roads is therefore 10L + 500 square meters. The cost of traveling the two roads is Rs. 3600, and the cost per square meter is Rs. 3. So, the total area covered by the roads in square meters is equal to the total cost divided by the cost per square meter: Total area = Total cost / Cost per square meter Total area = 3600 / 3 Total area = 1200 square meters We know that the total area covered by the roads is 10L + 500 square meters, so we can set up the following equation: 10L + 500 = 1200 Now, we can solve for L: 10L = 1200 - 500 10L = 700 L = 700 / 10 L = 70 meters Therefore, the length of the lawn is boxed{70} meters."},{"prompt":"f the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 5x + 6 = 0 are u and v, find the value of u^2 + v^2 + u + v.

Similarly, in ( triangle AED ): frac{sin angle AED}{sin angle DAE} = frac{AD}{ED}. 2. **Equating the Ratios**: Since ( AD ) is common in both triangles, we equate the ratios: frac{sin angle AFD}{sin angle FAD} = frac{sin angle AED}{sin angle DAE}. This implies: sin angle AFD = sin angle AED. 3. **Angles Relationship**: Therefore, ( angle AFD = angle AED ) or ( angle AFD + angle AED = 180^circ ).

Matching this to the possible values of 1 or -1, we can write down the following equations: - If fleft( frac{pi}{6}right) = 1, then frac{pi}{3} + varphi = frac{pi}{2} + kpi. - If fleft( frac{pi}{6}right) = -1, then frac{pi}{3} + varphi = -frac{pi}{2} + kpi.

Step 3: Analyze each square addition position - Positions on the inner corner of the L-shape (e.g., adjacent to B and C) may restrict certain folds necessary to form the open cube. - Positions on the outer areas of the L allow more flexibility in the folding since they are less likely to overlap improperly when visualizing the cube structure.

Assume possible suitable configurations exist primarily on the outer edges of the L-shape.

Hence, we need: [ S = -1 - 1 + -1 - ldots - 1 + 1 = -2 ] This calculation contradicts the initial setting of ( S = 2 ), because changing all pieces' sides would yield ( S = -2 ). **Conclusion:** Since the invariant ( S ) remains constant, and given that ( S ) cannot change its initial value from ( 2 ) to ( -2 ), it is impossible to reach a point where all the pieces are on the opposite side relative to their starting positions.

According to the Babylonian formula for the area of a quadrilateral, the area S can be calculated using the formula: [ S = frac{a + b}{2} cdot frac{c + d}{2} ] 3. To determine for which type of quadrilaterals this formula accurately computes the area, let's analyze the cases when the formula is consistent with the standard area formula for known types of quadrilaterals. 4. Consider the case when a = b and c = d. This implies the quadrilateral becomes a rectangle, where opposite sides are equal. 5. Substituting a = b and c = d into the formula: [ S = frac{a + b}{2} cdot frac{c + d}{2} = frac{a + a}{2} cdot frac{c + c}{2} = frac{2a}{2} cdot frac{2c}{2} = a cdot c ] 6. This is indeed the area formula for a rectangle, S = a times c, verifying that for rectangles, the Babylonian area formula is accurate. 7. Therefore, the formula: [ S = frac{a + b}{2} cdot frac{c + d}{2} ] correctly determines the area of rectangular quadrilaterals, where opposite sides are equal. # Conclusion: The formula accurately calculates the area of a rectangle when applied to a quadrilateral.

Let's break down each part of the solution step by step: **Part 1: Finding the Mode** The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. By counting the occurrences of each number, we find that the number 48 appears 3 times, which is more than any other number in the set. Therefore, the mode is 48. This makes option A correct. **Part 2: Finding the Median** To find the median, we first need to arrange the data in ascending order: 25, 27, 28, 38, 39, 41, 42, 45, 47, 48, 48, 48, 50, 52, 52, 53, 56, 59, 62, 63.

Therefore, option B is also correct. **Part 3: Calculating the Range** The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the set.

Since option C states that the range is 37, it is incorrect. **Part 4: Determining the 5% Quantile** The 5% quantile refers to the value below which 5% of the data fall. Since there are 20 data points, 20 times 5% = 1, indicating that we should look at the value in the 1st position, and since we typically average the 1st and 2nd positions when calculating quantiles, we get: 5% text{Quantile} = frac{1}{2} times (25 + 27) = 26.

The integral on the left side is: [ int frac{dy}{sqrt{9 - y^2}} = sin^{-1} left(frac{y}{3}right) + C_1 ] And the integral on the right side is: [ pm int frac{dx}{sqrt{9 - x^2}} = pm sin^{-1} left(frac{x}{3}right) + C_2 ] 4.

Take any vertex ( A ). - Let ( V_A ) be the set of neighbors of ( A ) and ( NV_A ) be the set of non-neighbors of ( A ). - Since the graph is a 3-connector, ( NV_A ) must form a complete subgraph. - If ( |NV_A| geq 2n + 1 ), then ( NV_A ) contains a windmill with ( n ) blades. - If ( |NV_A| leq 2n ), then ( |V_A| geq 2n + 1 ). - Consider the vertices in ( V_A ). Since the graph is a 3-connector, among any three vertices in ( V_A ), at least two must be connected. - We can iteratively form edges among the vertices in ( V_A ) until we have ( n ) pairs, forming a windmill with ( A ) as the hub. - Therefore, ( f(n) leq 4n + 1 ). - Combining both steps, we conclude that ( f(n) = 4n + 1 ).

To identify the independent and dependent variables, we examine the relationship between the two variables presented in the table. The independent variable is the one that is changed or controlled in a scientific experiment to test the effects on the dependent variable. In this case: - The time spent proposing concepts, denoted as x, is varied to observe its effect. Thus, x is the independent variable. - The acceptance ability of the students, denoted as y, changes in response to x. Therefore, y is the dependent variable. So, the independent variable is the time spent proposing concepts x, and the dependent variable is the students' acceptance ability y. 2. To find the students' acceptance ability when the time spent proposing concepts is 10 minutes, we look directly at the table: - When x = 10, we find that y = 59.

To analyze the time range over which students' acceptance ability increases and decreases: - From the table, as x increases from 0 to 13 minutes, y also increases, indicating that students' acceptance ability strengthens. This is the range where acceptance ability increases. - As x increases from 13 to 20 minutes, y decreases, indicating that students' acceptance ability weakens. This is the range where acceptance ability decreases.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 3 or 4 is 300 + 225 - 75 = 450. There are 900 three-digit numbers from 100 to 999.

What is the smallest sum of winding intervals which allows us to set them to the same time, no matter how they were set initially?","completion":"1. **Initial Observation**: - We are given five watches that can be wound forward. - We need to find the smallest sum of winding intervals to set all watches to the same time, regardless of their initial settings. 2. **Reduction of Problem**: - It never makes sense to wind all the watches a nonzero amount. Instead, we can reduce the problem by winding each watch relative to the minimum winding amount. - Let (a, b, c, d, e) be the winding amounts for the five watches. We can redefine these as (a - m, b - m, c - m, d - m, e - m) where (m = min(a, b, c, d, e)). 3. **Winding to a Common Time**: - We need to wind four of the watches to agree with the fifth. - Let (|x - y|) denote the amount we must wind watch (y) to agree with watch (x). 4. **Possible Winding Sums**: - The possible winding sums are: [ |a - b| + |a - c| + |a - d| + |a - e| ] [ |b - a| + |b - c| + |b - d| + |b - e| ] [ |c - a| + |c - b| + |c - d| + |c - e| ] [ |d - a| + |d - b| + |d - c| + |d - e| ] [ |e - a| + |e - b| + |e - c| + |e - d| ] 5. **Summing the Winding Intervals**: - Summing these winding intervals, we get: [ (|a - b| + |a - c| + |a - d| + |a - e|) + (|b - a| + |b - c| + |b - d| + |b - e|) + dots + (|e - a| + |e - b| + |e - c| + |e - d|) ] - Each pair (|x - y|) appears twice in the total sum, so the total sum is: [ 2 left( |a - b| + |a - c| + |a - d| + |a - e| + |b - c| + |b - d| + |b - e| + |c - d| + |c - e| + |d - e| right) ] 6. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle**: - The total sum of winding intervals is (120) hours (since there are (10) pairs and each pair appears twice, and each interval is (12) hours). - By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of the sums must not exceed (24) hours. 7. **Optimal Configuration**: - To achieve the minimum sum, we can space the times on (a, b, c, d, e) evenly over the 12-hour clock. - This ensures that the minimum sum of winding intervals is (24) hours. 8. **Conclusion**: - The smallest sum of winding intervals to set all watches to the same time is (24) hours.

First, we need to identify the grid points inside the square excluding the boundaries. Since the grid points on the edges are not considered, we inspect the interior grid structure which forms a (64 times 64) grid of points. Case 1: Both points lie on the specified lines (y = x or y = 65 - x). 1. **Identifying Key Points:** - For the line y = x, the grid points are (1, 1), (2, 2), ldots, (64, 64). There are 64 such points. - For the line y = 65 - x, the grid points are (1, 64), (2, 63), ldots, (64, 1). There are 64 such points.

Since the inequality given in the problem is homogeneous, we can assume ( x_1 geqslant x_2 geqslant cdots geqslant x_n geqslant 0 ) and ( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1 ). 2. Under these assumptions, the inequality can be transformed into [ sum_{1 leqslant i < j leqslant n} x_i x_j left( x_i^2 + x_j^2 right) leqslant c ] 3.

Consequently, for any ( x = left( x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n right) ), through successive adjustments, we ultimately get: [ begin{aligned} F(x) & leqslant F(a, b, 0, cdots, 0) = a b left( a^2 + b^2 right) & = frac{1}{2} (2ab)(1 - 2ab) & leqslant frac{1}{2} left( frac{2ab + 1 - 2ab}{2} right)^2 & = frac{1}{8} end{aligned} ] 11.

Each rhinoceros requires 100 acres of grazing area, so for 8000 rhinoceroses, we need: 8000 rhinoceroses * 100 acres/rhinoceros = 800,000 acres for grazing Adding the 10,000 acres of watering area, the total initial area required is: 800,000 acres (grazing) + 10,000 acres (watering) = 810,000 acres Now, we know that the preserve should have 890,000 acres to provide for the increased population. The difference between the initial area and the expanded area is the additional area needed for the increased number of rhinoceroses: 890,000 acres (expanded) - 810,000 acres (initial) = 80,000 acres (additional) Since each rhinoceros requires 100 acres, the additional number of rhinoceroses that the 80,000 acres can support is: 80,000 acres / 100 acres/rhinoceros = 800 rhinoceroses Now we can calculate the expected percentage increase in the number of rhinoceroses. The increase is from 8000 to 8000 + 800 rhinoceroses, which is an increase of 800 rhinoceroses. The percentage increase is calculated as: (Increased number of rhinoceroses / Original number of rhinoceroses) * 100% So, the expected percentage increase is: (800 / 8000) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10% Therefore, the expected percentage increase in the number of rhinoceroses is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"There are some passengers on a bus.

This rotation property remains true for all equilateral triangles on the plane. 4. **Triangle Centers and Rotation:** Given (overrightarrow{AD} = overrightarrow{DK}), consider the rotation around points: - When triangle (CAD) is rotated (60^circ) around C, ( A ) maps to ( B ), and ( D ) maps to ( E ). Thus, (CAD rightarrow CBE). - When triangle (HBE) rotates (60^circ) around H, (B) maps to (D) (since ( overrightarrow{AD} = overrightarrow{DK} )) and (E) maps to (K). So, (HBE rightarrow HDK). 5. **Conclusion by Rotation Mapping:** - Given the rotations described, we can conclude that (BHD) inherits the properties of an equilateral triangle because every pair of these points (B), (H), and (D) can be related through the same consistent geometric transformations which preserve edge lengths and angles. Thus, triangle (BHD) is equilateral because: - (B) to (H) to (D) fulfills the conditions of rotation, making them vertices of an equilateral triangle. 6. **Final Answer:** [ boxed{text{BHD is a regular triangle}} ]"},{"prompt":"Fortyeight identical toothpicks are used to form a hexagonal grid consisting of small regular hexagon arrangements. If the grid contains not only hexagons but also triangles within its structure, what is the fewest number of toothpicks that could be removed so that no triangles remain?","completion":"A hexagonal grid consists of hexagons, where each side of the small hexagon is made of a single toothpick. Each vertex connects three toothpicks, creating multiple triangular configurations within the larger hexagon. 1. Identify key configurations: Count how many triangles can be formed in one small hexagon and then multiply it by the number of small hexagons within the larger hexagon structure. Observing that each vertex is common to three hexagons and each hexagon contains 6 vertexes, triangles primarily form along each side and within each hexagon. 2. Best Strategy for Toothpick Removal: - To ensure no triangles can form, one must remove at least one toothpick from each possible triangle. Since each side of a hexagon contributes to forming a triangle with the adjacent sides, removing one toothpick from all common sides (between two adjacent hexagons) will prevent the formation of triangles. - Calculate: Each small hexagon shares sides with its neighbors. By removing one toothpick from each of these shared sides in a strategic manner, triangles can't form without breaking the continuity of all possible triangle-forming configurations. 3. Calculate Minimum Toothpick Removal: - Consider one hexagon and its immediate neighbors in a grid. Each hexagon touches six others (assuming a large enough grid), sharing 6 sides, so removing one side shared between every two hexagons can potentially remove all triangles. - Given 48 toothpicks for an arrangement of a few (e.g., 9) small hexagons, removing all potential shared sides (6 in total, one from each touch point shared with neighbors) leaves each hexagon isolated without forming triangles. boxed{6} toothpicks must be removed at minimum to ensure no triangles remain."},{"prompt":"Determine the nature of the function y=x+frac{4}{x} for x<0.

With area proportions 1:3, the heights h₁ and h₂ for the smaller and larger triangles created by the line through P satisfy frac{h₁}{h₂} = sqrt{frac{1}{3}} because the base lengths are equal. - Solve (h₁ + h₂) = 4 and frac{h₁}{h₂} = sqrt{frac{1}{3}} simultaneously. - Let h₂ = k, then h₁ = sqrt{frac{1}{3}} k. So sqrt{frac{1}{3}}k + k = 4. - Simplify to k(1+sqrt{frac{1}{3}}) = 4, hence k = frac{4}{1+sqrt{frac{1}{3}}}. - h₂ = frac{4}{1+frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}+1}, and h₁ = frac{4sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}+1}sqrt{frac{1}{3}} = frac{4}{sqrt{3}+1}. 4. **Position of P Relative to AB:** - Since h₂ is the altitude from P to AB, h₂ = frac{4sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}+1}.

Step 1: Equation of Line (AC) First, we find the equation of the line (AC). Since points (A) and (C) are given, we can compute the slope (m) of (AC): [ m_{AC} = frac{4 - 0}{2 - 4} = frac{4}{-2} = -2. ] Using the point-slope form of a line (y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)) and point (A(4,0)): [ y - 0 = -2(x - 4), ] [ y = -2x + 8. ] Thus, the slope-intercept form of the line (AC) is: [ y = -2x + 8. ] Step 2: Perpendicular Distance from Origin to Line (AC) The general form of the line (AC) is ( 2x + y - 8 = 0 ). The perpendicular distance from the origin (O(0,0)) to this line is given by: [ d = frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} text{ where } (x_1, y_1) = (0,0), , A = 2, , B = 1, , C = -8. ] Substitute (x_1, y_1, A, B, C) into the formula: [ d = frac{|2(0) + 1(0) - 8|}{sqrt{(2)^2 + 1^2}}, ] [ d = frac{|-8|}{sqrt{4 + 1}}, ] [ d = frac{8}{sqrt{5}}, ] [ d = frac{8sqrt{5}}{5}. ] Thus, the perpendicular distance from (O) to line (AC) (OD = frac{8 sqrt{5}}{5}).

Can Borya and Grisha have pants of the same color? # Solution: Step-by-Step Analysis 1. Given that there are five boys and only three different colors of pants, at least one color of pants must be worn by more than one boy. Let us analyze the implications of this for the specific colors. 2. Suppose we consider the color gray and begin by testing: - If Anton wore gray pants, he would have won the buuz competition. However, it is stated that Anton ate the least buuz, thus he cannot be in gray pants. - Similarly, if Dima wore gray pants, he would have won the khinkali competition. But Dima ate the least khinkali, so he cannot be in gray pants. - If Vova wore gray pants, he would have won the dumpling competition. Since Vova ate the least dumplings, he cannot be in gray pants either. Therefore, the gray pants must be worn by either Borya or Grisha. 3. By exclusion, since gray pants are only worn by Borya or Grisha, there could only be one pair of gray pants. Consequently, one of them must wear the gray pants and the other must wear either brown or crimson pants. 4.

She went to the mall and decided to spend her money on novels, clothes, and lunch. At the bookstore, she bought a set of ten novels imported from the UK that cost £13 each. The exchange rate was 1 = £0.7. She got a 20% discount on the total cost. Then, for lunch, she spent money equivalent to three times the cost of one novel in pounds. The bill included a 12% tax and she left a 18% tip on the pretax total. Jesse also decided to buy a jacket from a European brand on a 30% discount. The original price was €120, which was twice the amount she spent in the bookstore, not considering the discount nor the conversion rate. The exchange rate was £1 = €1.15. How much money did Jesse have left after her day at the mall?","completion":"Let's calculate Jesse's expenses step by step. **Bookstore:** First, we need to calculate the cost of the novels in pounds and then convert it to dollars. The cost of one novel is £13, so ten novels would cost £130. With a 20% discount, the total cost would be: £130 - (20% of £130) = £130 - (£130 * 0.20) = £130 - £26 = £104. Now, we convert £104 to dollars using the exchange rate 1 = £0.7: £104 / £0.7 = 148.57 (rounded to two decimal places). **Lunch:** The cost of lunch is three times the cost of one novel in pounds, which is £13 * 3 = £39. Now, we calculate the tax and tip on the lunch: Tax: £39 * 12% = £39 * 0.12 = £4.68. Tip: £39 * 18% = £39 * 0.18 = £7.02. The total cost for lunch in pounds is £39 + £4.68 + £7.02 = £50.70. Now, we convert £50.70 to dollars: £50.70 / £0.7 = 72.43 (rounded to two decimal places). **Jacket:** The original price of the jacket is €120, and Jesse gets a 30% discount, so the discounted price is: €120 - (30% of €120) = €120 - (€120 * 0.30) = €120 - €36 = €84. Now, we need to convert the cost of the jacket from euros to pounds using the exchange rate £1 = €1.15: €84 / €1.15 = £73.04 (rounded to two decimal places). Finally, we convert £73.04 to dollars: £73.04 / £0.7 = 104.34 (rounded to two decimal places). **Total Expenses:** Now, we add up all the expenses in dollars: Bookstore: 148.57 Lunch: 72.43 Jacket: 104.34 Total: 148.57 + 72.43 + 104.34 = 325.34 **Money Left:** Jesse started with 500, so the money she has left after her expenses is: 500 - 325.34 = 174.66.

This implies that ( a_i + 1 ) must divide ( 2a_i + 1 ). 5. **Determine the parity of ( a_i ):** Since ( 2a_i + 1 ) is always odd, ( a_i + 1 ) must also be odd. Therefore, ( a_i ) must be even. Let ( a_i = 2b_i ). 6. **Substitute ( a_i = 2b_i ):** [ m = prod_{i=1}^k left( frac{4b_i + 1}{2b_i + 1} right) ] This shows that ( m ) is a product of fractions of the form (frac{4b_i + 1}{2b_i + 1}), which are always odd. 7. **Induction to show all odd ( m ) are expressible:** - Base case: For ( m = 1 ), take ( n = 1 ). - Inductive step: Assume all odd numbers less than ( m ) are expressible. We need to show ( m ) is expressible. 8. **Case analysis:** - If ( m equiv 1 pmod{4} ), write ( m = 4z + 1 ). Then: [ m = frac{4z + 1}{2z + 1} times g(2z + 1) ] where ( 2z + 1 ) is expressible by the induction hypothesis. - If ( m notequiv 1 pmod{4} ), there exists ( r geq 2 ) such that ( m equiv 2^r - 1 pmod{2^{r+1}} ). Write ( m = 2^{r+1}x + 2^r - 1 ).

The total cost of the 20 kg of tea at 20 per kg is 20 * 20 = 400. The total cost of the mixed 100 kg of tea is the sum of the costs of the two types of tea: Total cost = 80x + 400. The trader wants to earn a profit of 35%. Therefore, the selling price of the mixed tea should be 135% of the total cost. The selling price of the mixed tea is given as 21.6 per kg for 100 kg, so the total selling price is 100 * 21.6 = 2160. Now we can set up the equation for the total selling price (which includes the desired profit) as follows: 135% of Total cost = Total selling price 1.35 * (80x + 400) = 2160 Now we can solve for x: 1.35 * 80x + 1.35 * 400 = 2160 108x + 540 = 2160 Subtract 540 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 108x = 2160 - 540 108x = 1620 Now, divide both sides by 108 to solve for x: x = 1620 / 108 x = 15 Therefore, the cost price per kg of the 80 kg of tea is boxed{15} ."},{"prompt":"Let ( x, y, z ) be complex numbers such that begin{align*} xy + 5y &= 20, yz + 5z &= 20, zx + 5x &= 20. end{align*} Determine all possible values for ( xyz. )","completion":"1.

For example, if we label the vertices of the cube as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ), we can choose the vertices ( A, C, E, ) and ( G ). These four vertices form the vertices of a tetrahedron within the cube and are not directly connected by edges. 2. **Assign Prime Numbers**: - Place four distinct prime numbers at these four vertices.

The reasoning is as follows: - Vertex ( B ) is connected to ( A ), ( C ), and ( F ). Assign: [ B = 2 times 3 times 5 = 30 ] - Vertex ( D ) is connected to ( A ), ( E ), and ( H ). Assign: [ D = 2 times 5 times 7 = 70 ] - Vertex ( F ) is connected to ( C ), ( E ), and ( H ). Assign: [ F = 3 times 5 times 7 = 105 ] - Vertex ( H ) is connected to ( G ), ( C ), and ( F ).

This means the total premium the insured paid should be close to the total amount insured (10000 fl.) minus the loss of the company (1000 fl.), i.e., 9000 fl. 2.

Thus, there are ( 2 = 2^{1} = 2^{2-1} ) ways. 3. **Induction Hypothesis** - Assume our statement holds true for ( k ) mathematicians, i.e., ( k ) mathematicians can settle into the rooms in ( 2^{k-1} ) ways. 4. **Inductive Step** - We need to show that ( k+1 ) mathematicians can settle into the rooms in ( 2^{k} ) ways. - Consider two scenarios: 1. **First mathematician chooses the first room**: In this scenario, all subsequent mathematicians occupy their designated rooms. This way counts as one arrangement. 2. **First mathematician chooses the ( n )-th room (where ( 2 leq n leq k+1 ))**: In this scenario, everyone up to the ( (n-1) )-th mathematician can occupy their designated rooms. Now there are ( k-n+2 ) mathematicians remaining with the first occupying one of their rooms. This is equivalent to the initial condition but with fewer people, reduced by the occupied room. 5. **Calculation for ( k+1 ) mathematicians** - For scenarios where the first mathematician chooses a room from 2 to ( k+1 ), the remaining mathematicians have ( 2^{(k-n+2)-1} ) ways based on our hypothesis. - Summing these possibilities, we get: [ 1 + sum_{n=2}^{k+1} 2^{k-n+1} = 1 + (2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ldots + 2^{0}) = 1 + (2^k - 1) = 2^k ] Therefore, we have shown by induction that ( k+1 ) mathematicians can settle into the rooms in ( 2^{k} ) ways. # Conclusion: Applying the result for 100 mathematicians, we conclude that there are ( 2^{99} ) ways for the mathematicians to occupy the rooms.

What is the width of her plot of land?","completion":"First, let's convert the area that the rabbits can clear from square yards to square feet, since the length of the grassland is given in feet. There are 9 square feet in a square yard. So, one rabbit can clear 10 square yards per day, which is equivalent to 10 * 9 = 90 square feet per day. Wendi has 100 rabbits, so together they can clear 100 * 90 = 9000 square feet of grassland per day. We are told that it takes 20 days for the rabbits to clear all the grass off of her grassland property. Therefore, the total area of the grassland is 9000 square feet/day * 20 days = 180,000 square feet. We know the length of the grassland is 900 feet, so to find the width, we divide the total area by the length: Width = Total Area / Length Width = 180,000 square feet / 900 feet Width = 200 feet Therefore, the width of Wendi's plot of land is boxed{200} feet."},{"prompt":"Build an irregular hexagon with six equal sides and four equal angles; with six equal angles and four equal sides.","completion":": 1. To begin, we understand the problem statement requires constructing an irregular hexagon with either six equal sides and four equal angles or six equal angles and four equal sides. **Case 1:** Constructing an irregular hexagon with six equal sides and four equal angles: Let's denote the hexagon as ( ABCDEF ). Since all sides are equal, we can set: [ AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA ] Next, we need to determine the angles: - Choose any four angles to be equal. For simplicity, let's assume ( angle A, angle B, angle E, angle F ) are equal. - The sum of interior angles of a hexagon is: [ (6-2) times 180^circ = 720^circ ] - Let each of the four equal angles be ( x ). The remaining two angles, let's say ( angle C ) and ( angle D ), should be such that: [ 4x + angle C + angle D = 720^circ ] For example, let ( x = 100^circ ): [ 4 times 100^circ + angle C + angle D = 720^circ ] [ 400^circ + angle C + angle D = 720^circ ] [ angle C + angle D = 320^circ ] Thus, ( angle C ) and ( angle D ) can be any combination that sums to ( 320^circ ). **Case 2:** Constructing an irregular hexagon with six equal angles and four equal sides: Let the hexagon again be ( ABCDEF ). Since all angles are equal, set each angle to be ( y ): [ angle A = angle B = angle C = angle D = angle E = angle F = y ] Since there are six angles in a hexagon, we have: [ 6y = 720^circ Rightarrow y = 120^circ ] Next, four sides should be equal. Set: [ AB = BC = CD = DA ] The remaining two sides, ( DE ) and ( EF ), can be different but should still connect to form the hexagon. For visualization, one would typically need to construct such hexagons using a compass and protractor or software that allows detailed geometric constructions. # Conclusion: The hexagon can indeed be constructed under both cases described with the detailed angle and side analysis above.

His earnings for the first 40 hours would be at the regular rate, and any hours beyond that would be at the overtime rate.

This means that from any given cell ((i, j)), a knight can move to the following cells: [ (i+2, j+1), (i+2, j-1), (i-2, j+1), (i-2, j-1), (i+1, j+2), (i+1, j-2), (i-1, j+2), (i-1, j-2) ] 2. **Analyzing Adjacency:** On Nikolai's board, two numbers (a) and (b) are adjacent if they share a common side. This means they are either horizontally or vertically next to each other. 3. **Corner Case Analysis:** Consider the corners of the (100 times 100) board. The corners have only two neighbors. For example, the top-left corner (cell 1) has neighbors at cells 2 and 101. Similarly, the top-right corner (cell 100) has neighbors at cells 99 and 200. 4. **Knight's Move Constraints:** For the knight's move condition to hold, the numbers in adjacent cells on Nikolai's board must be reachable by a knight's move on Stoyan's board. This imposes a strict constraint on the numbering. 5. **Contradiction via Parity Argument:** A key observation is that a knight's move changes the parity of the sum of the coordinates. If a cell ((i, j)) has coordinates with sum (i + j) even, then all cells reachable by a knight's move will have coordinates with sum odd, and vice versa. 6. **Parity on a (100 times 100) Board:** On a (100 times 100) board, the parity of the sum of coordinates alternates between even and odd. Therefore, adjacent cells on Nikolai's board will have sums of coordinates with the same parity (both even or both odd). 7. **Incompatibility with Knight's Move:** Since a knight's move changes the parity of the sum of coordinates, it is impossible for two adjacent cells on Nikolai's board (which have the same parity) to be at a knight's move distance on Stoyan's board (which requires different parities). 8. **Conclusion:** The requirement that every pair of adjacent cells on Nikolai's board be at a knight's move distance on Stoyan's board leads to a contradiction due to the parity argument. Therefore, it is not possible to number the cells in such a way.

To find out how many minutes the bus stops per hour, we need to calculate the ratio of the speed lost due to stoppages to the original speed without stoppages, and then convert that ratio into time. The ratio of the speed lost due to stoppages to the original speed is: 40 km/hr (speed lost) / 60 km/hr (original speed) = 2/3 This ratio also represents the fraction of the hour that the bus spends stopping.

Step 1: Understand the problem and the effect of plant coverage variation on the sampling method. The variation suggests that some plots may have more animals due to higher plant coverage, while others may have fewer. Step 2: Evaluate the given sampling methods: - **Systematic sampling** might not account for the variation in plant coverage effectively, as it involves selecting samples at regular intervals. - **Stratified sampling** involves dividing the population into strata that are more homogeneous within themselves.

Thus, the maximum value of f(x) is 4(1) + a = 4 + a. Given that the maximum value is 2, we can set up the equation: [ 4 + a = 2 ] Solving for a, we get: [ a = 2 - 4 = -2 ] Therefore, option A is correct because if the maximum value of f(x) is 2, then indeed a = -2.

Given a triangle ( ABC ), we need to construct a line that divides both the area and the perimeter of the triangle into equal parts. 2. Referring to problem 5.52, a line that divides the area and the perimeter of a triangle equally passes through the center of its inscribed circle (incenter), denoted as ( O ). 3. To construct the required line, assume we have established points ( M ) and ( N ) on sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) of triangle ( ABC ) respectively, such that the line ( MN ) passes through the incenter ( O ) and also bisects the perimeter of the triangle. 4. We'll construct a point ( D ) on the ray ( AC ) such that ( AD = p ), where ( p ) is the semiperimeter of triangle ( ABC ). By definition, ( AD ) is half of the entire perimeter because ( p ) equals half the perimeter. 5. It follows that ( AM = ND ). Let ( Q ) be the center of a rotation ( R ) that maps segment ( AM ) to segment ( DN ) (mapping point ( A ) to ( D ) and point ( M ) to ( N )). 6. Because the angle between lines ( AM ) and ( CN ) is known, the point ( Q ) can be found as the vertex of an isosceles triangle ( AQD ) where ( angle AQD = 180^circ - angle A ) and points ( B ) and ( Q ) lie on the same side of the line ( AD ). 7. Under the rotation ( R ), the segment ( OM ) transitions to the segment ( O'N ), making ( O' ) constructible. It is clear that ( angle O NO' = angle A ), as the angle between lines ( OM ) and ( O'N ) equals ( angle A ). 8. Hence, point ( N ) is the intersection of line ( AC ) and an arc from the circle centered at ( O ) such that segment ( OO' ) is visible at ( angle A ). Constructing point ( N ), we draw the line ( ON ) to locate point ( M ). 9. To verify, if points ( M ) and ( N ) lie on sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively, then the line ( MN ) is the required line. The primary step in the proof is to show that the rotation around point ( Q ) through ( 180^circ - angle A ) maps point ( M ) to point ( N ). Therefore, the geometry principles and specific construction of particular points ensure that the line ( MN ) bisects both the area and perimeter of triangle ( ABC ), leading to a successful construction. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A certain store sells a type of student backpack.

So we calculate the definite integral as follows: A = left[frac{x^3}{3}right]_0^1 - left[frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}right]_0^1 Evaluating at the bounds 0 and 1, we have: A = left(frac{1^3}{3} - frac{2}{3}(1)^{3/2}right) - left(frac{0^3}{3} - frac{2}{3}(0)^{3/2}right) A = left(frac{1}{3} - frac{2}{3}right) - (0 - 0) A = frac{1}{3} - frac{2}{3} A = -frac{1}{3} However, the area cannot be negative, so it appears we have an issue with the order of subtraction. We should subtract the function on the bottom from the function on the top, so the correct integral set up should be: A = int_{0}^{1} (sqrt{x} - x^2) dx Calculating this properly, we get: A = left[frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}right]_0^1 - left[frac{x^3}{3}right]_0^1 A = left(frac{2}{3} - frac{1^3}{3}right) - (0 - 0) A = frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{3} A = frac{1}{3} Therefore, the area of the region enclosed by the curves y^2=x and y=x^2 is boxed{frac{1}{3}}."},{"prompt":"Express, as concisely as possible, the value of the product left(0^{3}350right)left(1^{3}349right)left(2^{3}348right)left(3^{3}347right)cdotsleft(349^{3}1right)left(350^{3}0right).","completion":"1.

Let E be the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB and F be the midpoint of the leg BC. The angle between the median from F to C and the hypotenuse AB is denoted by alpha. We are to determine alpha. 2. **Identifying Key Components:** - The circle k with diameter AB (Thales' circle) is considered. - The similar circle m with diameter EB and center O is introduced. 3. **Considering Thales' Theorem:** Point F divides BC in half, and C lies on circle k, thus F also lies on circle m. Therefore, the line AF has an intersection with circle m. 4. **Identifying the Maximum Angle alpha:** Hence, alpha can be considered as at most the angle beta formed by the tangent from A to circle m (denoted as AD) and segment AB. We use triangle AOD to determine this. 5. **Calculations Using Right Triangle Properties:** [ sin beta = frac{OD}{OA} = frac{frac{1}{4} AB}{frac{3}{4} AB} = frac{1}{3} ] [ beta = arcsin frac{1}{3} approx 19.47^circ ] 6. **Formulating for Any alpha:** To show that for every 0^circ < alpha leq arcsin frac{1}{3}, there exists such a right triangle, note that the tangent point D intersects circle m differently if alpha = arcsin frac{1}{3} at D, and otherwise at D_1 and D_2. Magnifying D_i points projects them to D_i' on circle k, verifying it as the desired right triangle. 7. **Alternative Solution: Consider Specific Coordinates:** Let AB = 2, BC = 2a, AC = 2b, and AF = s. 8. **Calculations Using Pythagoras' Theorem:** From triangle ABC, [ 4 = 4a^2 + 4b^2 implies a^2 + b^2 = 1 ] From triangle AFC, [ s^2 = a^2 + 4b^2 ] 9. **Other Simplifications:** [ s^2 - a^2 = 4b^2 ] Considering the coordinates, [ cos alpha = frac{AB^2 + AF^2 - BF^2}{2 cdot AB cdot AF} = frac{4 + s^2 - a^2}{4s} = frac{1 + b^2}{sqrt{1 + 3b^2}} ] 10. **Calculating the Range:** Since 0 < b < 1, function [ f(b) = frac{1 + b^2}{sqrt{1 + 3b^2}} ] determines cos alpha values between frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} and 1.

Then, by finding the derivative of f(x), we can determine the intervals of monotonicity and thus find the maximum value of the function. **Solution** Given f[f(x)+4ln x+ frac{1}{ln x+1}]=0, we can set t=f(x)+4ln x+ frac{1}{ln x+1}, thus f(x)=-4ln x-frac{1}{ln x+1}+t, from f(t)=0, we get -4ln x- frac{1}{ln x+1}+t=0, therefore ln t=0 or ln t=-frac{3}{4}, therefore t=1 or t=e^{-frac{3}{4}}, since t > frac{1}{sqrt{e}}, we have t=1, therefore f(x)=-4ln x-frac{1}{ln x+1}+1, then f'(x)= frac{1}{x}left[frac{1}{(ln x+1)^{2}}-4right], since frac{1}{e} < x leqslant e, therefore -1 < ln x leqslant 1, thus when xinleft(frac{1}{e}, frac{1}{sqrt{e}}right), f'(x) > 0, and when xinleft(frac{1}{sqrt{e}}, eright), f'(x) < 0, therefore f(x)_{text{maximum value}}=f(x)_{text{local maximum}}=fleft(frac{1}{sqrt{e}}right)=1, hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}."},{"prompt":"Find the point where the line that passes through (3, 4, 1) and (5, 1, 6) intersects with the xzplane.","completion":"The direction vector for the line between the points (3, 4, 1) and (5, 1, 6) is given by: [ begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 1 - 4 6 - 1 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 2 -3 5 end{pmatrix}. ] This vector can be used to parameterize the line equation using one of the points, say (3, 4, 1), as: [ begin{pmatrix} 3 4 1 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} 2 -3 5 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t 4 - 3t 1 + 5t end{pmatrix}. ] We want to find the intersection with the xz-plane, which requires y=0.

Step 3: Inequality Relationship for x Noting that: [ 2x = A_{1}B + A_{1}C > BC, ] implies: [ x > frac{BC}{2}. ] Step 4: Relating A_{1} to triangle segments and inequality condition From the Power of a Point Theorem and the substitution made: [ 2A A_{1} = 2 frac{AB cdot x + A_{1}C cdot AC}{BC}. ] Given that: [ x > frac{BC}{2}, ] We then derive: [ 2 A A_{1} > (AB + AC) cdot frac{2}{2} = AB + AC. ] Thus, rearranging provides: [ A A_{1} > frac{1}{2}(A B + A C). ] Step 5: Extending the inequality to all sides Similarly for BB_{1} and CC_{1}, we can analogously show that: [ B B_{1} > frac{1}{2}(B A + B C), ] and [ C C_{1} > frac{1}{2}(C A + C B). ] Step 6: Summing up all the sides' inequalities Adding the three inequalities from step 5: [ A A_{1} + B B_{1} + C C_{1} > frac{1}{2}(AB + AC) + frac{1}{2}(BA + BC) + frac{1}{2}(CA + CB). ] Finally, combining and simplifying all terms, we obtain: [ A A_{1} + B B_{1} + C C_{1} > AB + BC + CA. ] Conclusion: Thus, the inequality A A_{1} + B B_{1} + C C_{1} > A B + B C + C A is proven to be true.

The profit from type A furniture is 0.5x and from type B furniture is 0.8(100-x). Therefore, the total profit y can be expressed as: y = 0.5x + 0.8(100-x) Simplifying this expression: begin{align*} y &= 0.5x + 80 - 0.8x y &= -0.3x + 80 end{align*} Thus, the functional relationship between y and x is: boxed{y = -0.3x + 80} Part 2: Maximizing the Total Profit y To ensure the production task is completed on time, the total time spent manufacturing both types of furniture must not exceed 160 days.

Substituting x = 16 into the function for y: begin{align*} y &= -0.3 times 16 + 80 y &= 75.2 end{align*} Therefore, to maximize the total profit y, x should be 16, and the maximum value of y is: boxed{y = 75.2 text{ (10,000 RMB)}}"},{"prompt":"f n is an odd number, find the value of ( frac {1+i}{1i})^{2n}+( frac {1i}{1+i})^{2n}.","completion":"First, let's simplify the expressions inside the parentheses: begin{aligned} frac {1+i}{1-i} &= frac {(1+i)^{2}}{(1-i)(1+i)} &= frac {1^2 + 2i + i^2}{1^2 - i^2} &= frac {1 + 2i - 1}{1 - (-1)} &= frac {2i}{2} &= i end{aligned} Now, since n is an odd number, we have: begin{aligned} ( frac {1+i}{1-i})^{2n}+( frac {1-i}{1+i})^{2n} &= (i^{2})^{n} + (frac{1}{i^{2}})^{n} &= (-1)^{n} + (-1)^{n} &= -1 + -1 &= -2 end{aligned} Therefore, the answer is: boxed{-2}."},{"prompt":"Given a sequence {a_n} with its first n terms sum S_n, where a_1=1 and S_n=n^2a_n for all positive integers n.

Therefore, the intersection point M has coordinates (-1,2). Next, we know that the line l_2 is parallel to the line l_1 which has the equation 2x+y+5=0. Since parallel lines have the same slope, the slope of l_2 must also be -2 (from the coefficient of x in l_1).

A: (3,4) B: (2,3) C: (1,2) D: (0,1)","completion":"To determine the interval where the zero of the function f(x) = x - 2 + log_{2}x lies, we first analyze the properties of the function components and then the function itself. 1. Considering y = x - 2 and y = log _{2}x, we note that both functions are increasing functions in the interval (0, +infty). This can be understood from the derivative of each function being positive in their domain of definition. Specifically, for y = x - 2, the derivative is 1, which is always positive. Similarly, for y = log_{2}x, the derivative is frac{1}{xln{2}}, which is also positive for x > 0. 2. Given that both components of f(x) are increasing in (0, +infty), f(x) itself must also be an increasing function over the same interval. This is true because the sum of two increasing functions is also an increasing function. 3. Since f(x) is increasing in (0, +infty), it can have at most one zero point in this interval. This is because, as an increasing function, once f(x) crosses the x-axis (i.e., f(x) = 0), it cannot decrease back to cross the x-axis again. 4. We then evaluate f(x) at specific points to find where the zero might lie. Specifically, we compute f(1) and f(2): - f(1) = 1 - 2 + log_{2}1 = -1 lt 0, since log_{2}1 = 0. - f(2) = 2 - 2 + log_{2}2 = 1 gt 0, since log_{2}2 = 1. 5. Given that f(1) lt 0 and f(2) gt 0, and since f(x) is increasing in (0, +infty), the zero of f(x) must lie between 1 and 2. This is due to the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval and takes on different signs at the endpoints of the interval, then it must have at least one root in that interval. Therefore, considering the given options, the only interval that satisfies the condition where the zero of f(x) lies is boxed{(1,2)}, which corresponds to option C."},{"prompt":"A holiday ham was purchased by three neighbors, each contributing 15 rubles.

Considering the geometry of the situation and that ( CM_3 ) lies within the triangle, there will be: - Angles ( angle ACM_3 ) and ( angle BCM_3) formed by the median (CM_3). 4. **Comparison Using Angle Properties:** We note the property from triangle median that states the angles formed at the base of the median will have the following property: - Since ( b < c ), the angle facing ( b ) will be larger when compared to the angle facing ( c ) due to the properties of larger triangles. Thus, for the median ( CM_3 ): [ angle ACM_3 > angle BCM_3 text{ when } CA < CB ] 5. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{} ] We conclude that the median ( CM_3 ) forms a larger angle with the shorter of the two sides ( CA ) and ( CB ).

Squaring both sides of these ratios and rearranging them gives us expressions for a^2, b^2, and c^2 in terms of sin^2A, sin^2B, and sin^2C respectively.

Substituting the relationship we found from the given equation, we get cos B = frac{ac}{2ac} = frac{1}{2}.

Using the sum-to-product identities, we can rewrite 4sin A - 2sin C as 4sinleft(frac{2pi}{3} - Cright) - 2sin C, which simplifies to 2sqrt{3}cos C by applying the sine and cosine addition formulas. Given that triangle ABC is acute, all angles are less than frac{pi}{2}, which implies 0 < C < frac{pi}{2} and 0 < frac{2pi}{3} - C < frac{pi}{2}. Solving these inequalities for C gives us frac{pi}{6} < C < frac{pi}{2}. Since cos C is positive and decreases as C increases within the range (0, frac{pi}{2}), the range of cos C when frac{pi}{6} < C < frac{pi}{2} is 0 < cos C < frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define the probabilities:** Let (P_{k, ell}) denote the probability that (A) wins when (A) has (k) more hits to go and (B) has (ell) more hits to go. Similarly, let (p_{k, ell}) be the increase in this probability when (A) scores an additional hit. [ P_{k, ell} = p cdot P_{k-1, ell} + q cdot P_{k, ell-1} ] Here, (P_{k-1, ell}) is the probability that (A) wins if (A) needs one less hit, and (P_{k, ell-1}) is the probability that (A) wins if (B) needs one less hit. 2. **Rearrange the equation:** To isolate the increase, we rearrange the equation. The increase in probability (p_{k, ell}) is defined as the difference between the probability after (A) scores (which is (P_{k-1, ell})) and the original probability (P_{k, ell}): [ p_{k, ell} = P_{k-1, ell} - P_{k, ell} ] 3. **Use the Total Probability theorem:** According to the law of total probability, the difference can also be expressed in terms of the probabilities of further hits: [ P_{k, ell} = q cdot (P_{k-1, ell} - P_{k, ell-1}) ] So, [ p_{k, ell} = P_{k-1, ell} - P_{k, ell-1} ] 4. **Interpretation of probabilities:** Assume that (A) and (B) will continue fighting until a total of (29) hits are achieved. Thus, [ P_{k-1, ell} text{ is the probability } A text{ wins by gaining at least } k text{ hits out of the remaining } k+ell ] And, [ P_{k, ell-1} text{ is the probability } A text{ wins by gaining at least } k+1 text{ hits out of the remaining } k+ell ] 5. **Exact probability calculation:** The difference (p_{k, ell}) is thus the probability that (A) scores exactly (k) hits out of the remaining (k+ell): [ p_{k, ell} = P_{k-1, ell} - P_{k, ell-1} ] 6. **Binomial probability:** This can be calculated using the binomial distribution, where the probability of scoring exactly (k) hits out of (k+ell) opportunities is: [ p_{k, ell} = binom{k+ell}{k} p^{k} q^{ell+1} ] Conclusion: Hence, the increase in the probability that (A) wins the match when (A) scores an additional hit can be given by the binomial coefficient and the probabilities (p) and (q): [ boxed{ binom{k+ell}{k} p^{k} q^{ell+1} } ]"},{"prompt":"Find the derivative of the following functions.

(b) Prove that there exist no infinite arithmetic progressions contained in ( S ).","completion":"**Part (a):** 1. **Lemma Statement:** We need to prove that for each positive integer m, there exist positive integers n leq m and x_m such that: [ left|n alpha - x_mright| < frac{1}{m}. ] 2. **Fractional Parts Analysis:** Consider the fractional parts of n alpha for n = 0, 1, 2, ldots, m, denoted by {n alpha} = n alpha - [n alpha]. By definition, each fractional part satisfies 0 leq {n alpha} < 1. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** Using the pigeonhole principle, since there are m+1 fractional parts and m intervals of the form left[frac{k-1}{m}, frac{k}{m}right) for k = 1, 2, ldots, m, there must be at least two distinct integers 0 leq n_1 < n_2 leq m such that {n_1 alpha} and {n_2 alpha} fall in the same interval. 4. **Establishing Bound on Fractional Parts:** Therefore, [ left| {n_2 alpha} - {n_1 alpha} right| < frac{1}{m}. ] 5. **Conversion to Integer Part Inequality:** Using the definition {x} = x - [x], we can write: [ left| n_2 alpha - [n_2 alpha] - n_1 alpha + [n_1 alpha] right| < frac{1}{m}. ] 6. **Defining New Parameters:** Let n = n_2 - n_1 and x_m = [n_2 alpha] - [n_1 alpha]. Thus, we have: [ left| n alpha - x_m right| < frac{1}{m}. ] 7. **Ensuring Positivity:** Since 0 leq n_1 < n_2 leq m, n is a positive integer less than or equal to m. Additionally, given alpha > 2 and n_2 > n_1, we have: [ x_m = [n_2 alpha] - [n_1 alpha] geq [alpha] geq 2, ] indicating that x_m is also a positive integer. 8. **Adjusting for Positivity of Fractional Part:** For convenience, assume 0 < {n alpha} < frac{1}{m}, ensuring: [ 0 < n alpha - x_m < frac{1}{m}. ] 9. **Conclusion of Lemma:** It follows that x_m = [n alpha]. Thus: [ n alpha = x_m + {n alpha}. ] 10. **Formation of Arithmetic Progression:** For any k in {1, 2, ldots, m}, we have: [ k x_m < n k alpha < k x_m + 1. ] Hence, [ [n k alpha] = k x_m, ] proving that [n alpha], [2n alpha], ldots, [mn alpha] form an arithmetic progression with common difference x_m. **Part (b):** 1. **Assumption of Infinite Arithmetic Progression:** Assume there is an infinite arithmetic progression in S: [ left[ n_1 alpha right], left[ n_2 alpha right], cdots, left[ n_i alpha right], cdots. ] 2. **Arithmetic Progression Property:** For each i, using the property of arithmetic progression: [ left[n_i alpharight] + left[n_{i+2} alpharight] = 2left[n_{i+1} alpharight]. ] 3. **Difference Formulation:** Therefore, [ (n_{i+2} - 2 n_{i+1} + n_i) alpha = left{ n_{i+2} alpha right} - 2left{ n_{i+1} alpha right} + left{ n_i alpha right}. ] 4. **Bounding Absolute Value:** Since fractional parts lie in [0, 1): [ left{ n_{i+2} alpha right} - 2left{ n_{i+1} alpha right} + left{ n_i alpha right} in (-2, 2). ] 5. **Implication from Division by Alpha:** Since n_{i+2}, n_{i+1}, n_i are integers and alpha > 2, we deduce: [ n_{i+2} - 2 n_{i+1} + n_i = 0. ] 6. **Infinite Arithmetic Progression of Indices:** Hence, n_1 alpha, n_2 alpha, ldots, n_i alpha, ldots is itself an arithmetic progression in terms of alpha. 7. **Condition for Fractional Parts:** This implies that left{ n_2 alpha right} = left{ n_1 alpha right}, yielding: [ n_2 alpha - n_1 alpha = left[ n_2 alpha right] - left[ n_1 alpha right] in mathbb{Z}. ] 8. **Contradiction with Irrationality:** This implies alpha is rational, contradicting the assumption that alpha is irrational.

For option B, if m parallel alpha and n lies in plane alpha, m can be either parallel to n or not lie in the same plane as n (skew lines).

Rearranging terms, we get: [ x^2 - x - 1 + frac{2}{x} = 2 sqrt{(x - frac{1}{x})(1 - frac{1}{x})} ] To further solve for (x), we square both sides again to eliminate the square root: [ left( x^2 - x - 1 + frac{2}{x} right)^2 = 4 left( (x - frac{1}{x})(1 - frac{1}{x}) right) ] Step 4: Expand and simplify both sides. Expanding the left-hand side, we obtain: [ (x^2 - x - 1 + frac{2}{x})^2 = x^4 + x^2 - 2x^3 - 2x + 1 ] The right-hand side can be simplified as follows: [ 4 left( x - frac{1}{x} right) left( 1 - frac{1}{x} right) = 4 left( x(1 - frac{1}{x}) - frac{1}{x}(1 - frac{1}{x}) right) ] [ = 4 left( x - 1 - frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x^2} right) = 4(x - frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{x^2}) ] Step 5: Equate the simplified forms and solve for ( x ). We now have: [ x^4 - 2x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ] To solve this polynomial equation, we factorize it. We notice the polynomial can be written as: [ (x^2 - x - 1)^2 = 0 ] Therefore: [ x^2 - x - 1 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation, and solving for ( x ) we use the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), and ( c = -1 ): [ x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ] Step 6: Check the solutions in the context of the original equation. We have two solutions: [ x = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} quad text{and} quad x = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ] However, all terms must be real and the conditions must hold. We see immediately that: [ x = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ] is negative, which does not satisfy the conditions of the square roots in the original equation where (x) must be real and non-negative. Thus, the only valid solution is: [ x = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] We verify this by substituting back into original equation. Hence, the final answer is: [ boxed{x = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"a workshop, the average salary per head of all the workers is Rs. 750.

We know that the total number of workers in the workshop is 20, so we can write: T + O = 20 (Equation 1) We are also given the average salaries for technicians, other workers, and all workers together. We can use this information to set up an equation based on the total salary paid to all workers. The total salary paid to technicians is T * Rs. 900, and the total salary paid to other workers is O * Rs. 700. The total salary for all workers is (T + O) * Rs. 750. So we can write the equation for the total salary as: T * Rs. 900 + O * Rs. 700 = (T + O) * Rs. 750 Using Equation 1, we can substitute O = 20 - T into the above equation: T * Rs. 900 + (20 - T) * Rs. 700 = 20 * Rs. 750 Now, let's solve for T: 900T + 700(20 - T) = 15000 900T + 14000 - 700T = 15000 200T + 14000 = 15000 200T = 15000 - 14000 200T = 1000 T = 1000 / 200 T = 5 So there are boxed{5} technicians in the workshop."},{"prompt":"Calculate the area of the figure bounded by the graphs of the following functions: y=frac{e^{1 / x}}{x^{2}}, y=0, x=2, x=1","completion":"1.

The integral representing the area S is: [ S = int_{1}^{2} frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2} , dx ] 3. To solve this integral, we use substitution. Let us make the substitution ( u = frac{1}{x} ). Then, ( du = -frac{1}{x^2} , dx ) or ( dx = -frac{1}{u^2} , du ). 4. Substituting ( u = frac{1}{x} ) into the integral bounds: - When ( x = 1 ), ( u = frac{1}{1} = 1 ) - When ( x = 2 ), ( u = frac{1}{2} ) Thus, the integral bounds change from 1 to 2 in terms of ( x ) to 1 to ( frac{1}{2} ) in terms of ( u ). 5. Now substitute ( u = frac{1}{x} ) and ( dx = -frac{1}{u^2} , du ) into the integral: [ int_{1}^{2} frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2} , dx = int_{1}^{frac{1}{2}} e^u left( -frac{1}{u^2} , du right) ] 6.

Recognize that ( dleft( -frac{1}{u} right) = frac{1}{u^2} , du ), so the integral becomes: [ -left[ e^u cdot left( -frac{1}{u} right) Bigg|_{1}^{frac{1}{2}} right] ] 9. Evaluating the above expression at the bounds ( u = 1 ) and ( u = frac{1}{2} ): [ -left[ left( e^u cdot left( -frac{1}{u} right) right) Bigg|_{1}^{frac{1}{2}} right] = -left[ - e^u Bigg|_{1}^{frac{1}{2}} right] = e^1 - e^{1/2} = e - sqrt{e} ] Hence, the area ( S ) bounded by the given curves is: [ boxed{e - sqrt{e}} ]"},{"prompt":"Simon has 25% more legos than Bruce, who has 30 more legos than Kent.

Since Kent has 80 legos and Bruce has 30 more than Kent, Bruce has: 80 legos (Kent) + 30 legos = 110 legos (Bruce) Now, let's find out how many legos Simon has. Simon has 25% more legos than Bruce. To find 25% of Bruce's legos, we calculate: 25% of 110 legos = 0.25 * 110 = 27.5 legos Since we're dealing with legos, which are indivisible, we'll round to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, we have a half lego, which is not possible, so we'll assume that the 25% more results in a whole number of legos. Therefore, we'll adjust the percentage slightly to ensure a whole number of legos for Simon. Let's assume Simon has exactly 25% more legos, which would be an additional 27.5 legos. Adding this to Bruce's total, we get: 110 legos (Bruce) + 27.5 legos = 137.5 legos (Simon) Since we can't have half a lego, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which gives Simon 138 legos. Finally, let's calculate the number of legos Clara has. Clara has 10% fewer legos than the total number of legos Simon and Kent have combined. First, let's find the combined total: 80 legos (Kent) + 138 legos (Simon) = 218 legos (combined) Now, 10% of the combined total is: 10% of 218 legos = 0.10 * 218 = 21.8 legos Again, we can't have a fraction of a lego, so we'll round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down since you can't have 0.8 of a lego, which gives us 21 legos. Clara has 10% fewer legos than the combined total, so we subtract the 21 legos from the combined total: 218 legos (combined) - 21 legos = 197 legos (Clara) In summary: - Kent has 80 legos. - Bruce has 110 legos. - Simon has 138 legos. - Clara has boxed{197} legos."},{"prompt":"Convert the point left(10, frac{3pi}{4}, 2 right) in cylindrical coordinates to rectangular coordinates.","completion":"Given the cylindrical coordinates (r,theta,z) where r = 10, theta = frac{3pi}{4}, and z = -2, the formulas to convert these to rectangular coordinates are: [ x = r cos theta = 10 cos frac{3pi}{4}, quad y = r sin theta = 10 sin frac{3pi}{4}, quad z = z ] cos frac{3pi}{4} = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} and sin frac{3pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.
