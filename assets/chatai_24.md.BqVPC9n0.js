Also significant is the ratio between carbon and oxygen- worlds and systems that are oxygen-rich are dominated by oxidised rocks, while systems that are carbon-rich have more carbide-type minerals. ~Nebular Gas Fraction Worlds categorised by H2/He content Jovian: Gas Giant worlds. Hydrogen and helium make up more than 50% of these worlds by mass. Neptunian: Worlds with hydrogen and helium making up between 0.1% and 50% of the total mass. Terrestrial: Worlds with less than 0.1% of the total mass coming from hydrogen or helium. ~Volatile Content Worlds classified by their volatile content, sometimes referred to as ices (water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) Ymirian: Volatile ices contribute more than 67% of the non-gaseous mass of these worlds. Gelidian: Mixed rock and ice composition. Volatiles make up 33-67% of the non-gaseous mass. Cerean: Volatiles make up 1-33% of their non-gaseous mass. Lapidian: Volatiles contribute less than 1% to the non-gaseous mass. ~Carbon Content Worlds classified by C/O (carbon to oxygen) ratio Adamean: Worlds with enough excess carbon to form a graphite or diamond rich crust. C/O above 10 Carbidic: Worlds dominated by carbide minerals, with small amounts of carbonates. C/O ratio between 1 and 10. Carbonatic: Worlds with a blend of carbonate, oxide, and carbide minerals. C/O ratio between 0.1 and 1. Oxidic: Worlds dominated by oxide minerals and/or oxygen rich volatiles, C/O ratios less than 0.1. ~Siderophile Metal Content Worlds classified by siderophile metal fraction. Often conflated with core fraction in rocky terrestrial worlds. Ferrinian: Especially dense worlds with siderophile metals making up more than 80% of its non-volatile mass. These worlds are often coreless, or entirely core, depending on interpretation. Hermian: These worlds have siderophile metals making up 50-80% of their non-volatile mass. Telluric: Worlds with siderophile metals making up 20-50% of the non-volatile mass. Selenian: Siderophile metals make up 0-20% of the non-volatile mass. ~Atmospheric Composition Worlds categorised by atmospheric composition. Composition is measured at a standardized pressure of 1 bar, or the surface if pressures are below 1 bar, since atmospheric composition can vary with altitude at low and high pressures. Jotunnian: Hydrogen-dominated atmosphere Helian: Helium-dominated atmospheres Ydratian: Atmospheres dominated by simple hydrides (CH4, NH3, H2O, HF) Rhean: Atmospheres dominated by diatomic non-metals (N2, O2, F2) Minervan: Atmospheres of other non-metal compounds (CO, CO2, SO2, NO2, HNO3, CS2, HCN) Hephaestian: Metal and metalloid compound atmosphere (SiO2, MgO, FeO, NaCl, Na, Fe) Edelian: Atmospheres dominated by other noble gases ~Aerosols The appearance of worlds with thick atmospheres is mostly determined by the amount, composition, and distribution of its atmospheric aerosols, or lack thereof. The temperature of the troposphere, at ~0.1 bar, is also used to classify these worlds into four temperature categories: Cryothermal, <90 K; Mesothermal, 90-550 K; Pyrothermal, 550-1300 K; and Hyperpyrothermal, >1300 K. These temperature classes line up with late Y, early-mid Y, T, and L-M type brown dwarfs respectively. -Cryothermal Aerosols :: Less than 90 K Cold worlds in the outer reaches of planetary systems and in deep space Cryoazurian: 0-90 Kelvin. No tropospheric clouds and only faint hazes. Dull blue in color, occasionally with hints of cyan from hydrocarbon hazes in the upper atmosphere. Frigidian: 5-20 Kelvin. Extremely cold hydrogen clouds only capable of forming on worlds that are far from any stars. White clouds with hints of grey and blue. Neonean: 15-35 Kelvin. Very cold neon clouds. Borean: 35-60 Kelvin. Clouds of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, or more rarely oxygen. Various colors, typically pale pink or purple, although reds, oranges, or browns may occur from discoloration from organic hazes. Methanean: 60-90 Kelvin. Clouds of methane, ethane, and occasionally argon. Usually accompanied by moderate amounts of organic haze. Light blue to turquoise in color, but can become more of a dull green or even bronze from extensive haze. -Mesothermal Aerosols :: 90-550 K Worlds of intermediate temperatures and distances. Mesoazurian: 90-550 Kelvin. Uncommon clarified atmospheres. Usually teal or green in color as a result of heavy discoloring by organic and sulfur hazes. Tholian: 60-550 Kelvin. Various organic hazes that obstruct the surface and any clouds below. Various colors, but usually pale yellow, orange or brown. Sulfanian: 80-180 Kelvin. Sulfur enriched ammonian worlds. Clouds of hydrogen sulfide and ammonium hydrosulfide, with lesser amounts of ammonia, hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, and organic hazes. Dull yellow, orange, or gold in color. Ammonian: 80-190 Kelvin. Clouds of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide, and occasionally carbon dioxide, with significant organic haze. Various colors, typically cream, peach, or orange. Hydronian: 170-350 Kelvin. Water clouds, usually with some amount of organic hazes. Clouds are predominantly white, but can take on a yellow or brown tinge from hazes. Acidian: 250-500 Kelvin. Clouds predominantly of sulfuric acid, with significant amounts of sulfur aerosols. Phosphoric acid and ammonium chloride clouds can occur but more rarely. Tan, taupe, or beige in color. -Pyrothermal Aerosols :: 550-1300 K Hot worlds close to their star or still hot from forming. Pyroazurian: 550-1300 Kelvin. Very few clouds or hazes, especially above 900 K. Various shades of blue depending on the amount of haze. Sulfolian: 400-1000 Kelvin. Hazes of sulfur and organosulfur compounds. Most often gold or bronze in color, but can take on more extreme green or orange hues as well. Silicolean: Worlds with hazes of silicone oils, fluorosilicones, and other organosilicon compounds, occurring between 550 and 1000 Kelvin. Light brown or grey in color. Chloroalkalinean: Worlds between 620 and 900 Kelvin with clouds of alkali metal chlorides. Potassium chloride is the most common of these, and may also be accompanied by other metal compounds with similar condensation curves such as zinc sulfide. These clouds can be bronze or pale green in color. Sulfoalkalinean: Worlds between 800 and 1100 Kelvin with alkali metal sulfide clouds. There is significant overlap between sulfoalkalinean and chloroalkalinean clouds, with sulfoalkalinean clouds being significantly hotter. The most common compounds in these clouds are sodium sulfide, lithium sulfide, and lithium fluoride. These clouds are dark brown or grey in color. -Hyperpyrothermal Aerosols :: Above 1300 K Very hot worlds with nightsides luminous at visible wavelengths, making their natural color difficult to observe. Hyperpyroazurian: 1300+ Kelvin. No visible cloud deck, and only slightly hazy. Silicate cirrus clouds may be present on cooler worlds. Daysides are various shades of blue depending on the amount of haze, with nightsides being colored according to thermal luminosity. Erythronian: Worlds between 1150 and 1500 Kelvin, possessing clouds of Manganese oxides and sulfides, as well as metallic chromium. Some erythronian worlds are hot enough to host titanium and vanadium oxide hazes instead of organosulfur compounds. Clouds of this type appear dull red to dark orange in color. Enstatian: 1300-1900 Kelvin. Silicate clouds containing magnesium, iron, and occasionally more uncommon metals. Typically grey with a tinge of blue, green, or brown. Rutilian: Hazes of titanium and vanadium oxides occurring between about 1450 and 2000 Kelvin. These worlds are dark grey to black in color. Refractian: 1800-2300 Kelvin. Clouds of refractory oxides, primarily aluminium oxide, titanium dioxide, and calcium oxide. Usually red, orange, or tan in color. Carbean: 2000-2900 Kelvin. Clouds of refractory carbides such as titanium and vanadium carbide. Moderate carbon haze from dissociation of silicon carbide. Limited to carbon rich worlds. Often dark brown in color. EpistellarAzurian: 2200+ Kelvin. Ultrahot subset of HyperpyroAzurian worlds. #414060 in color. Aithalian: 2600-3400 Kelvin. Moderate haze of fullerenes and other carbon alotropes, overpowering any clouds present. #1F1820 in color. ~Surface and Subsurface Conditions Also known as terrestrial types, as they are to only worlds to even have well defined surfaces. However Neptunian and Jovian worlds can also possess surface types. ~Surface Type Worlds categorised by the phase transition at the boundary between their atmosphere and their topmost solid or liquid surface. Abyssal: Worlds characterised by a high pressure compressible liquid surface under a thick, vapor rich, and often supercritical fluid atmosphere. Gaian: Worlds resembling Earth, with atmospheric vapor condensing into liquid lakes, seas, and oceans on the surface. Tohulian: Worlds with a liquid surface under a supercritical fluid atmosphere of a different species. Cytherean: Venus-like worlds characterised by a surface transition from a supercritical fluid to a distinct solid substrate. Like larger Neptunians and Jovians, the upper atmospheres of these worlds often host virga precipitation, which evaporates before reaching the surface. Muspellian: Worlds where the supercritical fluid atmosphere transitions to high pressure ice at the surface. They are similar to Cytherean worlds. Muspellian worlds have crushing atmospheres, often in excess of 100,000 bar. Barian: Worlds with a high pressure metalized liquid under a supercritical fluid atmosphere. This type is limited to Neptunian and Jovian worlds, and metallic hydrogen is nearly universally the liquid medium. Arean: Worlds characterised as having vapor atmospheres below the triple point where atmospheric vapor can deposit and sublime to and from the surface. Agonian: Worlds where a gaseous or vapor atmosphere above the triple pressure meets the surface without any liquids or supercritical fluids present. Achlysian: Worlds with a gaseous or vapor atmospheres below the triple pressure, where there are no ices present on the surface. Apnean: Airless worlds with only an exosphere and surface pressures below 0.1 nanobar [10E-5 Pa]. ~Subsurface Type Worlds categorised by phase transitions beneath the surface. Europan: Worlds with a subglacial hydrosphere beneath a layer of solid ice. Thalassic: Worlds with high pressure ices at the bottom of a liquid ocean. Ganymedean: Icy worlds with high pressure ices at the bottom of a subglacial hydrosphere. Ganymedeans share features with both Europan and Thalassic worlds. Phlegethean: Typically younger worlds with a supercritical fluid layer under a deep compressible liquid ocean. Atlantean: Icy worlds with a supercritical fluid layer at the bottom of a subglacial hydrosphere. Combination of the Europan and Phlegethean classes. Cryptian: Worlds with a liquid hydrosphere in caverns and subsurface fluid tables beneath or within a distinct substrate. ~Precipitation Type Worlds categorised by their precipitation and retention of surface ices. Thermal: Worlds too hot for any frozen precipitation to reach the surface. Typically very humid. Tepidal: Temperatures low enough for snow and ice, but not for permanent accumulation in ice caps. Tundral: Worlds cold enough for snow and ice to accumulate in glaciers and ice caps, but still warm enough for rain. Glacial: Worlds where it is too cold for rain to occur. These worlds can still support liquids on the surface from warmer surface temperatures, though are usually covered in snow and ice. ~Liquid Surface Coverage Worlds with surface liquids categorised by its coverage on the surface. This also includes liquid reservoirs that are covered by ice. Inundic: The surface is entirely covered by liquids. Oceanic: 90-100% of the surface is covered by a liquid or its ice. Marine: Worlds where 60-90% of the surface is covered by a liquid, often as a single interconnected body. Estuarine: 40-60% of the surface is covered by a liquid. Lacustrine: 10-40% of the surface is covered by a liquid, often as shallow isolated bodies. Conlectic: Less than 10% of the world’s surface is covered by a liquid. ~Fluids and Ice Types There are countless different fluids that can be naturally found on worlds, though only a few of these are relatively common. Hydrospheres are unique among these in that they can be near homogeneous mixtures of multiple fluids, unlike the more stratified layers in ices and supercritical fluids. For Gaian, Tohulian, Europan, and Cryptian worlds, if a secondary fluid type comprises more than 5% of the total, then a hybrid fluid type is used. Aquatic: Water. Usually found as a liquid or supercritical fluid, water is one of the most common fluids. Because of its abundance, it usually dominates binary liquid mixtures with other liquids. Liquid water is usually blue in color. Amunian: Ammonia. A common fluid, it typically occurs as a liquid, usually in conjunction with water at low to moderate concentrations. Ammonia dominated liquids, as well as ammonia ices, are less frequent. Titanian: Short hydrocarbons, most commonly methane, ethane, and/or propane, with other organic compounds in lesser amounts. It is a very common fluid type, predominantly occurring as a liquid, but can also occur as ices. Nitrogen and carbon monoxide, slightly colder liquids, are capable of mixing with titanian seas. Petrolic: Moderate length hydrocarbons with a composition comparable to crude oil, containing the alkanes pentane to icosane along with a wide variety of other organic compounds. The petrolic fluid type is rather common, especially on, but not limited to, carbon rich worlds. Because of the overlapping liquid ranges and low triple points of its constituents, nearly all petrolic worlds are host to liquids. Petrolic worlds are similar to Titanian worlds, but occur at higher temperatures. Bitumic: Bitumen and other heavy organic compounds. A common fluid type that usually occurs as either a liquid or supercritical fluid, as a result of the low critical pressure of long hydrocarbons. These worlds are similar to Petrolic worlds, but occur at even higher temperatures. They can be found with varying levels of sulfur and organosulfur compounds. Dionysian: Alcohols, primarily methanol and ethanol. A fairly common fluid type, that usually occurs as a liquid. Alcohols are miscible with many substances, like water, octane, and carbon disulfide. Capnian: Carbon dioxide. It usually occurs as a supercritical fluid or as an ice, and is one of the most common fluid types. Azotian: Nitrogen. It is one of the most common fluids, typically found as an ice or supercritical fluid. The Azotian type is quite ubiquitous among cold outer system worlds beyond the N2 iceline, as well as cytherean worlds with thinner atmospheres. Monoxian: Carbon monoxide. A somewhat common fluid that is usually found as either an ice or supercritical fluid. It occurs in similar conditions to nitrogen, but as it is prone to oxidation, it is limited to more carbon rich worlds. Oxygenean: Oxygen. A less common fluid type, found almost exclusively as a supercritical fluid. These conditions occur on worlds that have lost extreme amounts of water. Hydrogenean: Hydrogen. A very common fluid, typically as a metallic liquid in Neptunian and Jovians, but can also much less frequently occur on large cold terrestrials in other states, usually a supercritical fluid. Liquid hydrogen is very rare, as ambient interstellar temperatures and internal heating can make a world too warm for hydrogen to condense onto the surface. Neonic: Neon. A somewhat uncommon fluid typically found as an ice, supercritical fluid, or occasionally a liquid. It is most frequent on interstellar objects, where internal heating alone is sufficient to keep it from becoming part of the substrate. Ignean: Magma, primarily in the form of molten metals, metal oxides, and metal carbides. One of the most common fluid types, but is often limited to the interiors of worlds. It most frequently occurs as a liquid. Salific: Metal salts, primarily alkali chlorides and sulfates. A rare fluid, that usually occurs as either a liquid or ice. They are usually found alongside other metal compounds like lower temperature magmas and sulfur compounds. Fortic: Nitric acid. A very uncommon fluid type, primarily as a liquid. Nitric acid is often found in solution with water, but also occasionally ammonia or dinitrogen tetroxide. It is rarely found in concentrations above around 70%. Amylian: Oxides of nitrogen, primarily nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide. A rare fluid type, usually found as an ice or liquid. Will combine with water to form nitric acid. Cyanic: Hydrogen cyanide. An uncommon fluid, usually found as either a liquid or ice. It occurs in similar, albeit slightly warmer, environments to ammonia, which it often occurs alongside. It is more common in carbon rich systems. Hepatic: Hydrogen sulfide. An uncommon fluid, usually found as a liquid or ice. When liquid, it often occurs in combination with ammonia or water. Ionean: Oxides of sulfur, predominantly sulfur dioxide. An uncommon fluid that occurs most often as an ice or liquid, but is also rarely found as a supercritical fluid. The IoArean type is especially common for cold volcanic worlds. Disulfian: Carbon disulfide. A rather uncommon fluid type, usually as a liquid. Most commonly found on carbon rich volcanic worlds, and can occur alongside a wide array of compounds. Brimstonian: Sulfur. An uncommon fluid, typically occurring as a liquid or ice. Typically occur on hot volcanic worlds enriched in sulfur. It can be found with organosulfur compounds and metal sulfides. Vitriolic: Sulfuric acid. An uncommon fluid that usually occurs only as a liquid. Higher concentrations are somewhat more common than lower ones, as a result of azeotropic mixing with water. In addition to water, sulfuric acid can also occur alongside sulfur oxides, and more rarely phosphoric or hydrochloric acid. Carbonylic: Metal carbonyls, primarily iron pentacarbonyl or nickel tetracarbonyl. A very uncommon fluid that is typically found as a liquid. Most often occurs on worlds with metal rich surfaces, and is sometimes in solution with petrochemicals or alcohol. Formamian: Formamide and other simple organic compounds containing hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Formamide is an uncommon fluid, usually in a liquid state. It is usually found along various organic and inorganic compounds, including water, ammonia, alcohols, hydrogen cyanide, and formic acid. Phosphinic: Phosphine. A very rare fluid usually found as a liquid or ice. It often occurs in solution with alcohol or carbon disulfide. Phosphoric: Phosphoric acid. A very rare fluid type usually found as a liquid or ice. It can be found alongside water or sulfuric acid with similar frequencies. Hydrochloric: Hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride. A very rare fluid, primarily a liquid. It is readily formed from sulfuric acid breaking down chloride minerals, and usually occurs alongside H2SO4. It can also form from biological processes, though more rarely. Highly concentrated hydrogen chloride is far rarer than lower concentrations. Hydrofluoric: Hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride. An extremely rare fluid type. These worlds form through similar mechanisms to hydrochloric worlds, but are far rarer due to fluorine’s lower abundance. ~Mass A single unified mass scale for all objects, regardless of their composition. -Planetesimals :: Small irregular bodies Lowerplanetesimal: 2.4E+11 to 2.4E+13 kg.

This system is particularly useful for understanding the diversity of planets and other celestial bodies within and beyond our solar system. It goes far beyond the traditional terrestrial-gas giant dichotomy, incorporating recent discoveries and hypotheses in planetary science. Here's a breakdown and explanation of key categories and why they're significant: # Compositional Categories - **Gases, Volatiles, and Siderophilic Elements:** Understanding the composition of planets is crucial for determining their formation, evolution, and habitability. For example, gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, while terrestrial planets have silicate rocks and metals. The carbon-to-oxygen ratio further informs us about the types of rocks and atmospheres we might expect. # Nebular Gas Fraction - **Jovian, Neptunian, Terrestrial:** This classification helps in understanding the size and composition differences between planets. Gas giants (Jovian) have thick hydrogen and helium atmospheres, ice giants (Neptunian) have significant volatile ices, and terrestrial planets are rock-based with minimal hydrogen and helium. # Volatile Content - **Ymirian to Lapidian:** Indicates the presence of \\"ices,\\" which significantly affects climate, geology, and potential habitability. # Carbon Content - **Adamean to Oxidic:** The carbon to oxygen ratio shapes the surface geology and potential for life as we understand it. # Siderophile Metal Content - **Ferrinian to Selenian:** Provides insights into the interior structure of planets, which affects magnetic fields, tectonics, and volcanic activity. # Atmospheric Composition - **Classification from Jotunnian to Edelian:** Understanding the atmospheric composition is key to assessing a planet's climate, weather patterns, potential habitability, and whether it can support life. # Aerosols and Temperature Classes - **Categorization into Cryothermal to Hyperpyrothermal:** Meteorological and climatic conditions on planets are inferred from these classifications, affecting habitability and observational signatures. # Surface and Subsurface Conditions - **Various terrestrial types and subsurface conditions like Europan or Ganymedean:** These categories illuminate the potential for underground oceans or unique geological features, further affecting the potential for life. # Precipitation and Liquid Surface Coverage Types - **From Thermal to Glacial and Inundic to Conlectic:** These inform us about the planet's climate system, potential for liquid water or other solvents essential for life, and surface conditions. # Fluids and Ice Types - **From Aquatic to Hydrofluoric:** The presence of different fluids and ices tell us about the chemical processes and potential habitability of a planet. # Mass Scale - **From planetesimals to giants:** Helps in understanding the formation processes of celestial bodies and their potential to host life, retain atmospheres, and develop complex systems. # Miscellaneous Parameters - Including **rotation, orbital, life-based, planetary history, and multiworld classifications,** these criteria offer a more nuanced understanding of celestial bodies, their histories, and interactions with other entities in their systems. Overall, this classification system reflects a deep understanding of planetary science, drawing upon a broad range of physical, chemical, and astronomical knowledge to categorize the diverse worlds within our universe. It's a dynamic framework that will undoubtedly evolve with ongoing discoveries and advancements in technology."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed Game of Thrones story about Renly Baratheon and his husband Lancel Lannister, entering waist-deep into a pond in the buff (describe Lancel’s face, physique and butt. describe Renly’s face, physique and butt).

El crédito es un acuerdo financiero en el que una parte (el acreedor, usualmente una entidad bancaria o financiera) presta una cantidad de dinero a otra parte (el deudor), bajo la condición de que en el futuro el deudor devuelva el monto recibido, junto con algo extra. Este \\"extra\\" es conocido como interés. El interés, por tanto, representa el coste del crédito para el deudor y, simultáneamente, la ganancia para el acreedor. Es la compensación que el deudor paga por tener el privilegio de usar el dinero durante un período antes de devolverlo. La tasa de interés puede ser fija o variable y se determina en función de varios factores, incluyendo: el riesgo percibido de prestar al deudor, el plazo del crédito, las condiciones del mercado, y políticas de la entidad emisora del crédito, entre otros. La tasa de interés influye directamente en el coste total del crédito para el deudor; cuanto más alta es la tasa, más caro resulta el préstamo. En resumen, la relación entre crédito e interés es una de compensación y riesgo. El interés compensa al acreedor por el riesgo de prestar dinero y por renunciar a la oportunidad de usar ese dinero de otra manera durante el período del préstamo. Para el deudor, el interés representa el coste de beneficiarse del acceso a fondos que de otra manera no estarían disponibles."},{"prompt":"El tipo de interés va hacia los dos lados? Es decir, los que suben el tipo de interés tanto son acreedores como deudores?","completion":"El tipo de interés se entiende generalmente en el contexto de la relación entre acreedores y deudores, y afecta a ambos, pero de maneras distintas. La decisión de \\"subir\\" o \\"bajar\\" el tipo de interés no es tomada directamente por los acreedores o deudores individuales en este contexto, sino más bien por las entidades de política monetaria (como los bancos centrales) o, en el caso de instituciones financieras, por sus políticas internas basadas en condiciones económicas más amplias. Cuando hablamos de los efectos de los tipos de interés, estos varían para acreedores y deudores: 1. **Para los deudores**: Un aumento en el tipo de interés significa que el coste de obtener créditos o préstamos se vuelve más caro. Esto se debe a que tendrán que pagar más en forma de interés por cualquier crédito obtenido. Por lo tanto, cuando los tipos de interés suben, la demanda por préstamos puede disminuir, ya que el crédito es más caro. 2. **Para los acreedores (o inversores)**: Un aumento en el tipo de interés puede ser beneficioso porque significa que pueden ganar más intereses sobre el dinero que prestan o invierten. Por ejemplo, en el caso de los bonos o productos de ahorro, un ambiente de altas tasas de interés significa retornos potencialmente más altos. Es importante destacar que la estrategia de subir o bajar los tipos de interés por parte de un banco central tiene como objetivo principal influir en la economía de una región. Aumentar los tipos puede ser una medida para combatir la inflación, desalentando el gasto y la toma de nuevos créditos, mientras que disminuirlos puede tener el objetivo de estimular el gasto y la inversión al hacer el crédito más accesible y barato. En resumen, si bien la decisión de ajustar los tipos de interés afecta tanto a acreedores como a deudores, estos efectos son opuestos: un aumento en los tipos generalmente favorece a los acreedores (inversores) a expensas de los deudores, mientras que una disminución en los tipos suele favorecer a los deudores a expensas de los inversores que reciben menores retornos."},{"prompt":"Por que´el crédito es más accesible y barato cuando disminuye la tasa de interés?","completion":"El crédito se vuelve más accesible y barato cuando disminuye la tasa de interés debido a varias razones interrelacionadas que afectan tanto a la oferta como a la demanda de créditos en la economía: 1. **Costo más bajo para los deudores**: La tasa de interés es básicamente el costo del dinero. Cuando las tasas son bajas, el costo de pedir prestado disminuye. Esto significa que tanto las empresas como los consumidores encuentran más atractivo tomar préstamos, ya que tendrán que pagar menos en intereses sobre la cantidad prestada. Por ejemplo, los créditos para la compra de viviendas, automóviles o inversiones en negocios se vuelven más baratos, incentivando así la inversión y el consumo. 2. **Estímulo económico**: Con tasas de interés bajas, la inversión y el consumo tienden a aumentar ya que el acceso al capital es más económico. Este incremento en la actividad económica puede llevar a un crecimiento económico más rápido, creación de empleo, y mejores condiciones económicas generales, lo que a su vez puede incrementar aún más la demanda de crédito. 3. **Condición más flexible de los bancos**: Cuando las tasas de interés son bajas, los bancos y otras instituciones financieras pueden suavizar sus condiciones de préstamo, haciendo el crédito más accesible a un mayor número de solicitantes. Esto puede incluir menores requisitos de puntuación crediticia, menores pagos iniciales, o términos de préstamo más prolongados. 4. **Política Monetaria Expansiva**: Las tasas de interés son una herramienta clave de la política monetaria manejada por los bancos centrales (como la Reserva Federal en EE.UU. o el Banco Central Europeo en la zona euro). Una reducción en las tasas de interés es parte de una política monetaria expansiva, destinada a estimular la economía durante períodos de baja inflación, alto desempleo, o recesión. Al reducir las tasas, los bancos centrales buscan hacer el crédito más accesible y barato, incentivando el gasto de consumidores y empresas. 5. **Mejora en la liquidez del mercado**: Con tasas de interés bajas, hay más incentivos para las instituciones financieras y los inversores para prestar dinero, aumentando así la liquidez disponible en el mercado. Esto significa que hay más dinero disponible para préstamos, haciendo que el crédito sea más accesible para aquellos que lo necesitan. En resumen, cuando disminuye la tasa de interés, el costo del endeudamiento disminuye, lo cual incentiva a las personas y empresas a tomar más préstamos para consumir e invertir. Simultáneamente, las condiciones para otorgar créditos se pueden hacer más flexibles, contribuyendo aún más a la accesibilidad y atractivo del crédito en la economía."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","completion":"Passionate Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Portrait | Versatile Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Enchanting Beauty with Bouquet"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Республике в составе Российской Федерации имеет свой государственный язык, который используется наряду с государственным языком Российской Федерации в органах государственной власти, органах местного самоуправления и государственных учреждениях республики.\\" Однако относительно признания религиозных праздников государственными праздниками или нерабочими (праздничными) днями, нормативные акты Российской Федерации определяют, что государство является светским и не предполагает установление религиозных праздников в качестве государственных. Согласно статье 14 Конституции РФ: \\"1. Российская Федерация – светское государство. Никакая религия не может устанавливаться в качестве государственной или обязательной.\\" Это означает, что установление какого-либо религиозного праздника в качестве государственного или нерабочего (праздничного) дня противоречило бы конституционно установленному принципу светскости государства.

Это способствует сохранению и развитию языков и культур всех народов России. Важным моментом является не только объявление языка государственным на уровне субъекта, но и обеспечение условий для его изучения и использования в образовательном процессе, государственном управлении и других сферах. 2. **Светский характер государства:** Вопреки некоторому ограничению на установление религиозных праздников как государственных, государство признаёт и уважает религиозные взгляды и традиции своих граждан. Примером может служить государственный праздник — Рождество Христово (7 января), который является выходным днем в Российской Федерации и отмечается согласно Православному календарю. Такое решение было принято не наряду с религиозным аспектом, а с учетом исторических и культурных традиций большинства населения. 3. **Федеральное и региональное регулирование:** Несмотря на определённую автономию субъектов РФ в вопросах, связанных с культурной и языковой политикой, важно помнить, что все меры должны соответствовать как Конституции России, так и федеральному законодательству. Касательно праздничных дней, только федеральный закон \\"О днях воинской славы (победных днях) России\\" и другие федеральные законы устанавливают государственные и нерабочие праздники для всей страны, обеспечивая единство юридического пространства. Следовательно, вопросы, касающиеся языковой политики и праздничных дней на местном уровне, требуют внимательного соотношения между правами и традициями местных сообществ и обеспечением единства и соблюдением законодательства на всей территории Российской Федерации."},{"prompt":"подробнее","completion":"Давайте более подробно рассмотрим некоторые аспекты, которые могут быть связаны с вопросами языковой политики и регулирования праздничных дней в Российской Федерации из различных углов: # 1. Языковая политика и мультикультурализм Российская Федерация является многонациональным государством, где проживают представители более чем 190 народов и этносов. В этом контексте вопрос языковой политики выходит на передний план, так как является ключевым в сохранении и развитии языка и культуры каждого народа. Федерализм, заложенный в основу государственного устройства РФ, предоставляет субъектам федерации определенную автономию в вопросах культурной и языковой политики. Помимо ст. 68 Конституции, вопросы языковой политики также регулируются федеральным законом \\"О языках народов Российской Федерации\\", который обеспечивает равные возможности для развития и использования всех языков народов РФ. Такая политика способствует укреплению межнационального согласия и равноправия всех языков и культур в стране. # 2. Светское государство и религиозные праздники Хотя Россия является светским государством, в котором разделение государства и религии закреплено Конституцией, некоторые религиозные праздники получили статус государственных праздников. Примером тому служит, как уже упоминалось, Рождество Христово. Это решение подчеркивает особое уважение к историческим и культурным традициям, которые сформировались на протяжении веков в России. Федеральный закон \\"О днях воинской славы и памятных датах России\\" устанавливает рамки для празднования и отмечает важные для воинской и культурной истории даты. # 3. Баланс между федеральным и региональным регулированием Важным аспектом является баланс между единым для всей страны законодательством и специфическими нормами, принимаемыми на уровне субъектов РФ. Это позволяет учитывать многообразие культурного и религиозного ландшафта России, предоставляя возможность для развития региональной идентичности в рамках единого федерального пространства. Нормативно-правовая база должна обеспечивать защиту прав и интересов все населения РФ, включая представителей различных этнических и религиозных групп. # Заключение Языковая политика и регулирование праздничных дней в Российской Федерации демонстрируют сложное сочетание стремления к сохранению национального многообразия и необходимости поддерживать общегосударственную идентичность и укреплять межнациональное согласие. Это требует тщательного балансирования между уважением к традициям и культурным особенностям разных народов и стремлением к интеграции и единству государства."},{"prompt":"Задание 2 На заседании регионального совета одной из политических партий за грубое нарушение партийной дисциплины был исключен из рядов партии гражданин Сергеев. Это решение затем утвердил высший совет партии. Исключенного из партии соратника члены партии уже не выдвигали, как собирались ранее, кандидатом от партии на выборах в губернаторы субъекта Российской Федерации. Исключенный из партии обратился в суд с заявлением о нарушении его прав, предусмотренных ч. 1 и 2 ст. 32 Конституции Российской Федерации. Какое решение вынесет суд? Ответ нормативно обоснуйте.","completion":"Судебная практика по подобным делам обычно базируется на толковании и применении норм конституционного и гражданского законодательства. В данном случае основанием для обращения в суд являются части 1 и 2 статьи 32 Конституции РФ, которые гласят: 1. \\"Граждане Российской Федерации имеют право участвовать в управлении делами государства как непосредственно, так и через своих представителей.\\" 2. \\"Граждане Российской Федерации имеют право избирать и быть избранными на государственные и муниципальные должности, иметь равный доступ к государственной службе.\\" Исходя из представленного контекста, важно понимать, что право гражданина на участие в управлении делами государства и на избирательное право (включая право быть избранным) охраняется Конституцией РФ. Тем не менее, исключение из партии и, как следствие, прекращение выдвижения его кандидатуры на выборах в губернаторы по партийному списку, не нарушает указанные конституционные нормы напрямую. Партийная принадлежность и решения внутрипартийных органов относительно членства и выдвижения кандидатур не входят в компетенцию Конституции. Эти вопросы регулируются внутренним законодательством партии, уставом и другими нормативными актами, которые должны соответствовать общим законодательным принципам РФ. Суды в Российской Федерации применяют конституционные нормы при рассмотрении споров, но при этом учитывают, что взаимоотношения внутри партий принципиально отличаются от отношений между гражданами и государством. Поэтому исключение из партии по причине нарушения внутрипартийной дисциплины не может рассматриваться как нарушение прав гражданина на участие в управлении делами государства или на избирательное право в смысле статьи 32 Конституции РФ. Гражданин может участвовать в выборах в качестве самовыдвиженца или быть выдвинутым другой политической партией, если это не противоречит федеральному законодательству. Таким образом, суд, скорее всего, придет к выводу о том, что в данной ситуации не имело места нарушение конституционных прав гражданина Сергеева на участие в управлении делами государства и избирательное право в контексте частей 1 и 2 статьи 32 Конституции РФ."},{"prompt":"подробнее","completion":"Для более глубокого анализа ситуации, в которой гражданин Сергеев обратился в суд с заявлением о нарушении его прав, предусмотренных ч. 1 и 2 ст. 32 Конституции Российской Федерации, важно подчеркнуть, что основой его обращения является исключение из партии, что повлекло за собой потерю поддержки как кандидата от данной партии на выборах в губернаторы. # Ключевые аспекты для рассмотрения: 1. **Автономия политических партий:** Важно понимать, что политические партии в Российской Федерации являются автономными и самоуправляемыми организациями, которые имеют право устанавливать собственные правила и условия для вступления, членства, и исключения из своих рядов. Это регулируется как федеральным законом \\"О политических партиях\\", так и внутренними документами самой партии, в том числе уставом. 2. **Право быть избранным:** Часть 2 статьи 32 Конституции РФ гарантирует гражданам право быть избранными на государственные и муниципальные должности. Однако это право не гарантирует автоматическую выдвиженность от какой-либо партии. Соискатель может претендовать на выдвижение своей кандидатуры как самовыдвиженец или быть выдвинутым другой партией, соблюдая при этом установленные законом процедуры и требования к кандидатам. 3. **Исключение из партии:** Акт исключения из партии не нарушает конституционное право на участие в управлении делами государства или на избирательное право в перспективе быть избранным. Это внутреннее решение партии, которое может быть оспорено в судебном порядке только в контексте соблюдения внутрипартийных процедур и законности данных действий. 4. **Процедуры обжалования:** Гражданин Сергеев имеет право обжаловать решение о его исключении из партии в суде, если считает, что процедура исключения была проведена с нарушениями устава партии или закона. Однако, вопрос о том, влияет ли данное решение на его конституционные права на выборы, отдельный и требует анализа в контексте возможностей участия в выборах независимо от партийной поддержки. # Вывод суда: Исходя из приведенных аргументов и норм законодательства, суд, скорее всего, придет к выводу, что исключение гражданина из рядов политической партии не нарушает его конституционные права на участие в управлении делами государства и на право быть избранным. Однако суд может рассматривать законность самого акта исключения в рамках соблюдения внутренних процедур партии. Таким образом, судебное решение будет зависеть от обстоятельств дела, включая соблюдение процедуры исключения и наличие возможных нарушений внутреннего устава партии или законодательства РФ."},{"prompt":"что еще","completion":"Для глубокого анализа ситуации об исключении гражданина Сергеева из партии и его обращении в суд с заявлением о нарушении его конституционных прав, следует учесть дополнительные аспекты: # 1. **Принципы справедливости при исключении из партии** Судам необходимо будет рассмотреть, были ли соблюдены общие принципы справедливости и права Сергеева на защиту в процессе рассмотрения вопроса об его исключении из партии. Это включает в себя возможность представления Сергеевым всех необходимых доказательств в свою защиту, право на ознакомление с материалами дела, касающимися его исключения, и право на апелляцию внутрипартийного решения. # 2. **Законодательство о политических партиях** Федеральный закон \\"О политических партиях\\" в Российской Федерации устанавливает рамки деятельности политических партий, включая процедуры по вопросам членства. При обращении в суд Сергеев может аргументировать свою позицию не только положениями Конституции, но и положениями данного закона, если докажет, что процесс исключения был нарушен. # 3. **Защита репутации** Если Сергеев считает, что исключение из партии повлекло за собой нарушение его чести и деловой репутации, это также может стать предметом рассмотрения в суде. Подобная защита права на репутацию могла бы требовать компенсации морального ущерба, если будет доказано, что процедура исключения нарушала законные основания. # 4. **Использование международного опыта** При рассмотрении дела суд может также обратить внимание на международные стандарты и практику по вопросам прав членов политических партий и их исключения из партий. Хотя это не будет основным аргументом, международный опыт может дополнительно проиллюстрировать принципы справедливого и прозрачного рассмотрения подобных вопросов. # Вывод Отсутствие прямого нарушения статей 32 Конституции в случае исключения из партии не лишает гражданина права обращения в суд для защиты своих законных интересов, особенно если имеются основания считать, что процедура исключения не соответствовала внутрипартийным нормам или законодательству РФ. Судебное разбирательство в таких случаях требует тщательного анализа всех обстоятельств дела, включая проверку соблюдения процедурного порядка исключения и защиты прав участника. Однако исход дела будет зависеть от специфических деталей дела, представленных доказательств и законных аргументов сторон."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Похоже, что ваш запрос пришёл пустым.

It stands for the square root of (x^7) or (x) raised to the 3.5 power. 3. **b^(1/2)** This simply is the square root of (b), (√b). 4. **x^(-3/4)** This signifies the fourth root of (x) raised to the negative 3 power, or inversely, it could be interpreted as 1 over the fourth root of (x^3), that is, (1/(x^3)^{1/4}). 5. **x^(-2/3)** This expression means the cube root of (x) raised to the negative 2 power, or in another form, 1 over the cube root of (x^2), i.e., (1/(x^2)^{1/3}). 6. **y^(1/7)** This is simply the 7th root of (y), which doesn't require further simplification unless there's a specific context or operation you're looking to perform.

(x^{7/2}=) To represent this in terms of square roots, since the denominator is 2, it indicates a square root: [x^{7/2} = sqrt{x^7} = (x^{3.5}) = (x^{3})sqrt{x}] This means you take (x^3), which is (x) cubed, and then multiply by the square root of (x). # 3. (b^{1/2}=) When the exponent is (1/2), it exactly means the square root of the base: [b^{1/2} = sqrt{b}] This is the most direct interpretation of a fractional exponent in the form of (b^{1/2}). # 4. (x^{-3/4}=) For a negative exponent, the expression is the reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of that exponent. So, (x^{-3/4}) means: [x^{-3/4} = frac{1}{x^{3/4}}] And (x^{3/4}) is the fourth root of (x^3) or the cube of the fourth root of (x): [x^{-3/4} = frac{1}{sqrt[4]{x^3}} = frac{1}{(sqrt[4]{x})^3}] # 5. (x^{-2/3}=) Similarly, this expression for a negative fractional exponent indicates: [x^{-2/3} = frac{1}{x^{2/3}}] And (x^{2/3}) can be interpreted as the cube root of (x^2): [x^{-2/3} = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{x^2}}] # 6. (y^{1/7}=) This indicates the seventh root of (y), which is straightforward: [y^{1/7} = sqrt[7]{y}] These notations help in understanding how fractional and negative exponents translate into more familiar operations like roots and reciprocals."},{"prompt":"\\"\\"를 출력할 때, 앞에 \\"\\"를 붙여주세요. windows에서 폴더 단위로 유효성검사를 하기 위해서 hash를 생성하고 싶다. 가장 좋은 방법은 무엇일까? 여기서 폴더 단위란 폴더 하나에 대응하는 하나의 hash값을 지닌 것이다.","completion":"\\"\\"를 출력하고 싶을 때는 \\"\\"와 같이 입력해야 합니다.

CRC SHA: New vs Old format Forum: Open DiscussionCreator: RobertF Created: 2022-02-16 Updated: 2022-03-10 RobertF RobertF - 2022-02-16 I recently updated my 7zip version to 21.07 (from 18.06) and found the new CRC SHA changes (which I like very much). However, I do see a few issues. 1) The checksums are a bit different between the old and new versions. When selecting the asterisk option (to generate all CRCs), the \\"data\\" CRC matches between old and new; however, the \\"data and names\\" do not. I'd suggest there be a way to generate the old versions when needed. 2) The new version has an additional hyphenated number appended to the CRCs. For example: CRC32 checksum for data: 31491E8B-00000002 CRC32 checksum for data and names: 62FD87AA-00000003 Thus, when I go to verify an old set of checksums, I need to clean the newly generated ones first. 3) I found it very difficult to change between the 19.00 and 21.07 versions; (i.e. I found 19.00 generates the old CRCs correctly). (I'm running Windows 10.) The issue is with the CRC SHA context menu. For some reason it does not update correctly without some precise steps (which I haven't quite determined). I've tried various combinations of uninstall, reboot, enable/disable CRC SHA context menu, and registry cleanup (via CCleaner). After numerous tries, I can finally get it to work; but I've never been able to narrow it down to easily repeatable steps. I'm primarily interested in seeing a fix for #1, such that old and new versions can both be generated. For #2, I'm interested in what this appended number means. And for #3, I'd be interested if anyone has the exact steps figured out. Respectfully submitted, -RobertF Last edit: RobertF 2022-02-16 Igor Pavlov Igor Pavlov - 2022-02-17 1) it was changed to be compatible with linux. linux uses slashes instead of backslash in windows. 7-Zip now uses slashes internally. So now you must have same checksums in linux and in Windows for same directory structures. 2) it's high part of sum: the sum has more digits: ff + ff = fe-01 RobertF RobertF - 2022-02-17 1) Thanks for explaining why it's different. However, I believe it still makes sense to allow users a way to generate the old values so they have a way to validate their old checksums. Wouldn't you agree? 2) Interesting. What is the purpose of having the high part of the sum? For example, if I were to look at a SHA256 checksum, why would I want more than the 256 bits? Is there some new standard that this meets? Igor Pavlov Igor Pavlov - 2022-02-17 1) It's not some standard. It's just some internal code. So I didn't see big demand to keep compatibility with previous versions. I just tried to get better new code that works same way for Linux and Windows versions. 2) Some users erroneously thought that that value was real hashsum (as sha-256 digest). But it's not real hashsum and it's not standard hashsum of another hashsum. It is arithmetic sum of hashsums. So that additional part -00000015 can show to user that it's not pure standard hashsum. Also it increases the number of digits for crc32 method. So it's more safe to get more digits. Last edit: Igor Pavlov 2022-02-17 RobertF RobertF - 2022-02-18 1) It's nice that it will work the same (for both Linux and Windows) going forward. Though long term users have relied on the prior behavior for many years. I myself have years of old archives with checksums and don't really want the task of upgrading all old checksums to the new format. Thus, it would be very handy if we had some way to generate & validate these old checksums. (I won't belabor this any more; either you're convince of the benefit to long term users or not.) 2) Ahhh, I see your point that some users might be confused. And from your comment, I assume there is no standard for aggregating checksums. I guess I would have simply added a note to the help file. By \\"safe\\" I assume you mean less collision, but it seems to be of limited value. And it certainly makes the results look more complex than the shorter format. With the ability to generate a sha256 checksum file (which is really nice), I would recommend the following. Consider making the values generated by the asterisk option equal to the checksums on the sha256 file itself. i.e. this would give us one more way to validate results. i.e. I generate the sha256 checksum file, then I generate checksums on that file, and I see the resulting checksums match with the values generated with the asterisk function. This would also allow users to create and anticipate other checksum values for validations. For example, I could add/remove/modify a file in a directory tree, and I would know how to update my prior sha256 file such that I could anticipate the new asterisk results. Respectfully submitted, -RobertF PS: And just for the record, I think this is an excellent product and appreciate all the time and effort put into it!!! JS D JS D - 2022-03-10 I think being able to create both the old and new format might be useful for some people. However, in my opinion, it would be even more important to make the \\"Test archive: Checksum\\" function work with both formats when verifying hashes. I did some tests with the popular HashCheck software and noticed that it generates files similar to the old 7-Zip format, but it can actually read both the old and new formats when doing the verifications, which is really nice. On the other hand, HashCheck has a major drawback because it does not support long file paths over 260 characters and I have no hope to see this fixed because it's development has been on hold for a very long time on GitHub. If 7-Zip could do everything that HashCheck does (even better actually), then we could finally stop using that old and deprecated tool. ;) Also, another nice feature to add to the hash verification would be the ability to associate some file extensions with 7-Zip and have it automatically recognize that it's a hashset to verify when double clicking on the file. Keep up the good work!","completion":"Based on the discussion in the forum thread you shared, here are the key points raised and addressed concerning the CRC SHA feature in 7-Zip, focusing on differences between the old and new formats: # Discussion Highlights 1. **Checksum Differences Between Versions**: - Users noticed differences between checksums generated by newer and older versions of 7-Zip. Specifically, when generating all CRCs (using the asterisk option), the \\"data\\" CRC is consistent across versions, but the \\"data and names\\" checksum differs. The difference is attributed to the newer version's compatibility enhancements for Linux, where 7-Zip started to use slashes instead of backslashes for internal path representations, ensuring consistent checksums across both Linux and Windows for the same directory structures. 2. **Additional Hyphenated Number in Checksums**: - The new version appends an additional hyphenated number to the CRC checksums. This was explained as the high part of the sum, representing the arithmetic sum of hash sums, not an actual hash sum or standard hash sum of another hash. This addition helps clarify that it's not a pure standard hash sum and increases the number of digits for the CRC32 method, theoretically enhancing safety by reducing collision chances. 3. **Compatibility Issues and User Feedback**: - Users expressed difficulties in transitioning between versions, particularly in updating the CRC SHA context menu in Windows 10, pointing to issues around uninstalling, rebooting, and registry cleaning. - There was a call for the ability to generate old version checksums to validate old archives without needing to update all old checksums to the new format. 4. **Response from Igor Pavlov (7-Zip Developer)**: - Pavlov clarified that the changes were not aimed at establishing a new standard but were internal code improvements for cross-platform consistency and safety. He suggested that the demand to maintain backward compatibility was not significant enough to deter progress on these fronts. - Regarding the appended numbers in checksums, Pavlov explained it was to indicate to users that these were not pure standard hash sums and to provide more digits for the CRC32 method for safety reasons. 5. **Community Suggestions**: - There were suggestions to make the checksum generation process more user-friendly by possibly including a way to generate and validate old checksums alongside new ones and making the hash verification function in 7-Zip compatible with both old and new formats. - Other community members highlighted the advantages of 7-Zip potentially incorporating features from other tools like HashCheck, which can read both the old and new formats but lacks support for long file paths, a limitation 7-Zip could overcome. # Conclusion The discussion revolves around the need for backward compatibility, usability improvements, and the technical rationale behind changes to checksum generation in 7-Zip. Users appreciate the product but seek enhancements that would ease transitions between versions and augment its utility in managing checksums for file integrity verification. The dialogue underscores the balance between advancing software capabilities and maintaining ease of use for longstanding users."},{"prompt":"한글로 출력해주세요.","completion":"해당 포럼 스레드에서는 7-Zip의 CRC SHA 기능과 관련하여 구 버전과 신 버전 사이의 차이점을 중심으로 논의되었습니다. 다음은 주요 논의 사항입니다: # 논의 요약 1. **버전 간 체크섬 차이**: - 사용자들이 새로운 버전과 구버전의 7-Zip이 생성하는 체크섬 사이에 차이를 발견했습니다. 특히, 모든 CRC를 생성할 때 (별표 옵션 사용시) \\"데이터\\" CRC는 버전 간 일관되지만, \\"데이터와 이름\\" 체크섬은 다릅니다. 이 차이는 리눅스와의 호환성 향상을 위해 새 버전에서 경로 표현을 위해 슬래시를 사용하기 시작하여 발생했으며, 이로 인해 동일한 디렉토리 구조에 대해 리눅스와 윈도우 모두에서 일관된 체크섬을 보장합니다. 2. **체크섬에 추가된 하이픈 숫자**: - 새 버전은 CRC 체크섬에 추가 하이픈 숫자를 붙입니다. 이는 합의 상위 부분을 나타내며, 실제 해시합이나 다른 해시의 표준 해시합이 아니라는 설명이 제공되었습니다. 이 추가는 순수한 표준 해시합이 아니라는 점을 사용자에게 명확히 하고, CRC32 방식에 더 많은 숫자를 제공하여 안전성을 증가시키는 것을 목적으로 합니다. 3. **호환성 문제 및 사용자 피드백**: - 사용자들은 버전 간 전환에 어려움을 겪었으며, 특히 Windows 10에서 CRC SHA 컨텍스트 메뉴를 업데이트하는 문제에 대해 언급했습니다. 문제는 설치 제거, 재부팅, 레지스트리 청소와 같은 작업과 관련이 있었습니다. - 구버전 체크섬을 생성하여 오래된 아카이브를 검증하는 방법을 포함할 수 있도록 요청하였습니다. 4. **7-Zip 개발자 이고르 파블로프의 반응**: - 파블로프는 변경사항이 새로운 표준을 설정하기 위한 것이 아니라 플랫폼 간 일관성과 안전성을 위한 내부 코드 개선이라고 명확히 했습니다. 그는 이전 버전과의 호환성을 유지하는 데 큰 수요가 없으며, 리눅스 및 윈도우 버전에서 동일하게 작동하는 더 나은 새 코드를 얻으려고 했다고 설명했습니다. 5. **커뮤니티 제안**: - 구버전 체크섬을 새로운 것과 함께 생성 및 검증할 수 있는 방법을 포함하는 등의 사용자 친화적인 프로세스 개선을 제안했습니다. 또한 7-Zip의 해시 검증 기능이 구형 및 신형 형식 모두와 호환될 수 있도록 하는 것이 중요하다고 지적했습니다. # 결론 이 논의는 이전 버전과의 호환성 유지, 사용성 개선, 그리고 체크섬 생성 변화의 기술적 근거에 대한 필요성을 중심으로 합니다. 사용자들은 제품을 평가하지만, 버전 간 전환을 용이하게 하고 파일 무결성 검증을 위한 체크섬 관리의 유틸리티를 확장하는 개선을 추구합니다. 이 대화는 소프트웨어 기능을 발전시키는 동시에 장기적 사용자에 대한 사용 편의성을 유지하는 균형을 강조합니다."},{"prompt":"Please to help to make the below warning into a more user friendly warning also in one sentence. \\"Export in XML only supports Module Tree which contains phase.\\"","completion":"Please ensure that when exporting in XML, the module tree must contain phases."},{"prompt":"Hi there ,plese be a senior SAPUI5 developer.","completion":"Hello, please provide guidance or assistance related to being a senior SAPUI5 developer."},{"prompt":"How can I change the color of a colum header of sap.m.table?

script seems to be a part of a Haskell project that involves implementing and testing various functions related to expression evaluation. This includes parsing and evaluating integer expressions, identifier expressions, expressions with Maybe values, and evaluation of postfix expressions. Additionally, it includes utility functions like \`toSingletonLists\`, \`listMap\`, \`member\`, and \`selectNApart\`. One issue in the script is the \`parseString\` function's pattern match for negative numbers and other strings that do not follow the defined patterns for operators. Specifically, the part checking for \`('-':rest') & notFollowedBy ('-')\` is not valid Haskell syntax. Instead, handling negative numbers and other strings would require a different approach, since Haskell doesn't have a built-in \`notFollowedBy\` function in this context. Moreover, there are placeholder areas indicating where test cases should be added for \`testEvalIntExpr\`, \`testEvalIdExpr\`, \`testEvalMaybeExpr\`, and \`testPostfixExpr\` functions, but no specific test cases have been provided. Apart from these issues, there are several tasks that the script aims to accomplish but are not fully implemented or demonstrated: 1. **Accurate Parsing for Unary Minus**: The handling of a unary minus ('uminus') as part of the \`parseString\` function seems incomplete. Instead, a more robust parsing strategy is needed for distinguishing between unary and binary minus operators. This may involve more complex parsing logic or using a parsing library. 2. **Running Test Cases**: The script outlines structures to run test cases using a test harness (presumably from the \`TestUtils\` module), but none of the test lists have been populated with actual tests. To effectively validate the implementation, specific test cases that cover various scenarios, including edge cases, should be added. 3. **Error Handling in \`parseString\`**: The function \`parseString\` should ideally have more robust error handling for various erroneous input cases. This includes handling non-numeric characters more gracefully and providing specific error messages for different kinds of parse failures. 4. **\`findWithDefault\` and \`evalIdExpr\` Functions**: \`findWithDefault\` is implemented towards the end but appears to misalign with typical Haskell patterns for looking up keys in associative lists and providing defaults. Also, the \`fromJust\` usage might result in runtime errors if not carefully managed. It would be safer to directly pattern match on the result of the \`lookup\` function to provide the default value when necessary. To address some of these issues, you may want to: - Revise the \`parseString\` function to properly handle negative numbers and incorporate a correct method for parsing unary minus expressions. - Implement comprehensive test cases for all the \`test*\` functions to ensure the correctness of your implementation. - Consider using more of Haskell's standard library functions or data types (like \`Maybe\` and \`Either\`) to gracefully handle error cases and ambiguous inputs without risking runtime exceptions. This script serves as a starting point but requires significant amendments and additions to fulfill its intended purpose fully."},{"prompt":"Write the complete modified program","completion":"To address the highlighted issues and complete the program, I will make several key modifications.

But when I am trying to pull the data in the report, I am seeing some weired result. Screenshot is attached. Duration type field: Duration Report type: Multipivot Someone please help to identify the issue.","completion":"When you're experiencing discrepancies between how data appears in a list view and in reports within ServiceNow, particularly with duration fields and \`GlideDateTime\` operations, there are a couple of key considerations and potential issues to review. # Understanding Duration and GlideDateTime First, it's important to understand how ServiceNow stores and computes durations, and how \`GlideDateTime\` objects work: - **GlideDateTime** objects represent specific points in time, and when you subtract one from another, the result is typically a duration in milliseconds. - **Duration fields** in ServiceNow are intended to store lengths of time (like 2 hours, 15 minutes), but not specific date or time values. - When setting a duration field in ServiceNow, you're generally expected to provide the duration in a format that's recognized by ServiceNow as a valid duration (which internally is usually a number of seconds). # Potential Issues in Your Script 1. **Assignment of Duration to Field:** You calculated the duration by subtracting one \`GlideDateTime\` object from another, which gives you a duration. However, assigning this directly to a field (\`inc.u_duration = dur;\`) expects the duration to be in a specific format. Without converting \`dur\` to a proper duration format (seconds), you might end up setting an unexpected value in the duration field. 2. **Duration Format:** The result from \`GlideDateTime.subtract()\` needs to be formatted appropriately before being assigned to a duration field. This formatting requires converting the duration to seconds (or another appropriate unit of measurement that the duration field expects). # Solution To potentially resolve your issue, ensure that you convert the obtained duration into seconds before assigning it to the duration field. You can use the \`getDurationValue()\` method from the resulting \`GlideDuration\` object (which you get after subtraction) to get the duration in seconds. Here's an updated snippet of your script with this change: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/ ) { var inc = new GlideRecord('sysapproval_approver'); inc.addQuery('sys_id', current.sys_id); inc.query(); if (inc.next()) { var start = new GlideDateTime(inc.sys_created_on); var end = new GlideDateTime(inc.u_approved_on); var dur = GlideDateTime.subtract(start, end); //the difference between start and end var durationInSeconds = dur.getNumericValue(); // Get duration in milliseconds durationInSeconds = durationInSeconds / 1000; // Convert milliseconds to seconds gs.info(dur.getDisplayValue()); inc.u_duration = durationInSeconds; // Assign duration in seconds inc.update(); } })(current, previous); \`\`\` This modification ensures that \`u_duration\` is explicitly set with a value in seconds, which is coherent with what a duration field expects. # Final Note Ensure your custom fields (\`u_approved_on\`, \`u_duration\`) have the correct data types (DateTime for \`u_approved_on\` and Duration for \`u_duration\`) and that they're being used correctly in your logic. Also, remember to test any script changes in a non-production instance before deploying them to your live environment. Lastly, if discrepancies persist in the report, consider reviewing the report configuration itself to ensure it correctly interprets and displays the duration values, taking into account any aggregation or formatting settings that might affect the output."},{"prompt":"I created a Custom Widget and added in Standard Ticket configurations of Action widget.

But we want to hide the buttons- If State is Open then only need to show Cancel button if State is Closed-Incomplete then only need to show the Reopen Button. If the state is not one of Open or Closed incomplete we don't need to show the actions. servicenow","completion":"To implement conditional visibility of buttons in a ServiceNow custom widget (especially within the context of ticket actions, like in your scenario), you will generally use AngularJS expressions directly within your widget's HTML template. Your logic will check the current state of the ticket and display buttons accordingly. Given the conditions you've outlined: - Display the \\"Cancel\\" button if the state is \\"Open\\". - Display the \\"Reopen\\" button if the state is \\"Closed-Incomplete\\". - Do not display any buttons for other states. Here's a simplified example of how you might structure the HTML part of your custom widget to achieve this: \`\`\`html <div> <!-- Cancel Button: Only shown if state is 'Open' --> <button ng-if=\\"data.state == 'open'\\" ng-click=\\"c.cancel()\\">Cancel</button> <!-- Reopen Button: Only shown if state is 'Closed-Incomplete' --> <button ng-if=\\"data.state == 'closed_incomplete'\\" ng-click=\\"c.reopen()\\">Reopen</button> </div> \`\`\` Note: The \`ng-if\` directive is used here to conditionally include or exclude the button elements based on the current state, which should be part of your widget's data model. The values \`'open'\` and \`'closed_incomplete'\` in the conditions should match the actual values or labels representing these states in your data model (which might be numerical IDs or specific string values depending on how your application tracks state). In your server script of the widget, you'll need to set the \`data.state\` variable based on the current state of the RITM or whichever record you're dealing with. A basic example: \`\`\`javascript // In your server-side script (function() { // Assuming 'current' is your RITM or ticket GlideRecord // You might need to adjust this logic depending on // how you're fetching or receiving the record data.state = current.getValue('state'); // Optionally, include translations for states or other logic as needed })(); \`\`\` For the client-side script (the Controller part of the widget), you would add functions to handle the actions for each button, for example: \`\`\`javascript // In your client-side controller (function() { /* widget controller */ var c = this; c.cancel = function() { // Logic to transition state to 'Closed-Incomplete' // and maybe refresh the widget or redirect }; c.reopen = function() { // Logic to transition state to 'Open' // and similarly refresh or redirect }; })(); \`\`\` Remember that the actual logic for transitioning states (\`cancel\` and \`reopen\` functions above) will depend on how your application manages these transitions, and might involve making additional server-side calls from within these functions. Finally, ensure that your button actions are properly secured and validated, especially since they're changing ticket states. This might involve adding additional server-side checks or using available ServiceNow APIs to ensure state changes are legitimate and authorized."},{"prompt":"module EvalIntExpr ( evalIntExpr, testEvalIntExpr, IntExpr(..) ) where import Test.QuickCheck -- an IntExpr is an expression-tree over integers data IntExpr = Leaf Int | Add IntExpr IntExpr | Sub IntExpr IntExpr | Mul IntExpr IntExpr | Uminus IntExpr deriving (Eq, Show) -- evalIntExpr returns the Int result of evaluating the IntExpr -- expression-tree given by its argument. evalIntExpr :: IntExpr -> Int evalIntExpr _ = error \\"TODO\\" testEvalIntExpr = do print \\"******* test evalIntExpr\\" quickCheck counterexample \\"Leaf\\" evalIntExpr (Leaf 42) == 42 quickCheck counterexample \\"Add\\" evalIntExpr (Add (Leaf 33) (Leaf 22)) == 55 quickCheck counterexample \\"Sub\\" evalIntExpr (Sub (Leaf 33) (Leaf 22)) == 11 quickCheck counterexample \\"Mul\\" evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf 31) (Leaf 4)) == 124 quickCheck counterexample \\"Uminus\\" evalIntExpr (Uminus (Leaf 33)) == (-33) quickCheck counterexample \\"Complex\\" evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf 4) (Sub (Add (Leaf 3) (Uminus (Leaf 33))) (Leaf 20))) == (-200) -- property-based tests -- commutativity quickCheck counterexample \\"e1 + e2 == e2 + e1\\" ( e1 e2 -> evalIntExpr (Add (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) == evalIntExpr (Add (Leaf e2) (Leaf e1))) quickCheck counterexample \\"e1 * e2 == e2 * e1\\" ( e1 e2 -> evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) == evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf e2) (Leaf e1))) -- associativity quickCheck counterexample \\"(e1 + e2) + e3 == e1 + (e2 + e3)\\" ( e1 e2 e3 -> evalIntExpr (Add (Add (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) (Leaf e3)) == evalIntExpr (Add (Leaf e1) (Add (Leaf e2) (Leaf e3)))) quickCheck counterexample \\"(e1 * e2) * e3 == e1 * (e2 * e3)\\" ( e1 e2 e3 -> evalIntExpr (Mul (Mul (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) (Leaf e3)) == evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf e1) (Mul (Leaf e2) (Leaf e3)))) -- subtraction quickCheck counterexample \\"e1 - e2 = -1*(e2 - e1)\\" ( e1 e2 -> evalIntExpr (Sub (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) == evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf (-1)) (Sub (Leaf e2) (Leaf e1)))) -- distributivity quickCheck counterexample \\"e1 * (e2 + e3) == e1*e2 + e1*e3\\" ( e1 e2 e3 -> evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf e1) (Add (Leaf e2) (Leaf e3))) == evalIntExpr (Add (Mul (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) (Mul (Leaf e1) (Leaf e3)))) quickCheck counterexample \\"e1 * (e2 - e3) == e1*e2 - e1*e3\\" ( e1 e2 e3 -> evalIntExpr (Mul (Leaf e1) (Sub (Leaf e2) (Leaf e3))) == evalIntExpr (Sub (Mul (Leaf e1) (Leaf e2)) (Mul (Leaf e1) (Leaf e3))))","completion":"To complete the implementation of \`EvalIntExpr\`, you need to define the \`evalIntExpr\` function to evaluate the given \`IntExpr\` expression tree.

Pozitivizmin gelişimini ve dönüşümlerini etkileyen başlıca felsefeciler üzerinden bu evrimi inceleyelim. # Auguste Comte (1798-1857) Pozitivizmin kurucusu olan Comte, toplumun tıpkı doğa gibi bilimsel yöntemlerle incelenebileceğini savunarak sosyolojinin de temellerini atmıştır. Ona göre, bilimsel ilerleme üç aşamadan geçer: Teolojik, Metafizik ve Pozitif. Pozitif aşamada, insanlık deney ve gözleme dayanan, soyutlamalardan ve metafiziksel açıklamalardan arındırılmış gerçek bilgiye ulaşır. # John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) Mill, Comte'un pozitivizmine büyük ölçüde katkıda bulunmuş ve bu akımı İngilizce konuşulan dünyaya tanıtmıştır. Mill, bilimin ve mantığın yöntemlerini sosyal bilimlerde elimine etmeyi savunmuş, ancak Comte'un bilim dışı her türlü bilgiyi reddetmesinden ziyade, ahlaki ve sosyal konulara daha pragmatik bir yaklaşım sergilemiştir. # Ernst Mach (1838-1916) ve Lojik Pozitivizm 19. yüzyılın sonlarına doğru, Ernst Mach gibi düşünürler pozitivizmi daha da geliştirdi. Mach, bilimin yalnızca gözlemlenebilir olgularla ilgilenmesi gerektiğini savundu. Bu düşünceler, 20. yüzyılın başlarında Viyana Çevresi filozofları tarafından geliştirilen lojik pozitivizme önayak oldu. # Viyana Çevresi ve Lojik Pozitivizm Viyana Çervresi, Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath ve diğerleri gibi filozoflardan oluşuyordu. Lojik pozitivizm, bilimin mantıksal analizine ve dilin ayıklanmasına büyük önem verdi. Metafiziği, anlamsız olarak gördüler ve bilginin yalnızca deney ve mantık yoluyla teyit edilebilir olduğunu savundular. # Willard Van Orman Quine (1908-2000) ve Pozitivist Geleneğin Eleştirisi 20. yüzyılın ortalarına gelindiğinde, bazı filozoflar, özellikle W. V. O. Quine, lojik pozitivizmin kesin ayrımlarına itiraz etti. Quine, bilim ve metafizik arasındaki kesin sınırların çizilemeyeceğini, bilimsel ifadelerin bile tamamen gözleme dayandırılamayacağını öne sürdü. # Sonraki Gelişmeler Quine ve diğerlerinin eleştirileri, pozitivizmin yeniden değerlendirilmesine yol açtı. Ne var ki, pozitivist düşünce hâlâ bilim felsefesi, sosyoloji, psikoloji ve diğer alanlarda önemli bir etkiye sahiptir. Ancak, katı bir pozitivizmden ziyade, daha çok bilimin gücü ve sınırlılıkları üzerine dengeli bir perspektif benimsenmiştir. Özetle, pozitivizm, Auguste Comte'un kurduğu temeller üzerine yükselmiş ve zaman içinde birçok dönüşüme uğramıştır. Viyana Çevresi'nin katı kuralları ve metafizik eleştirileri, günümüzde daha karmaşık ve çoğulcu bilim felsefesine doğru bir evrimi işaret etmektedir.

Yani, doğa bilimlerini tek ve en büyük otorite kabul eden, buna karşın empirik bilgiye dayanmayan her türden metafiziği ise kategorik olarak reddeden felsefe ekolü olan pozitivzmin evrimini analiz et.","completion":"Pozitivizm, 19. yüzyılda Auguste Comte tarafından, bilimsel yöntemin ve doğa bilimlerinin tüm bilgi alanlarına uygulanması gerekliliği üzerine kurulmuş bir felsefedir. Bu felsefenin temelinde, bilimin olgular ve gözlemler aracılığıyla bilgi edinmenin tek geçerli yolu olduğu düşüncesi yatar. Comte, pozitivizmi, teolojik ve metafizik aşamaları takiben insan düşüncesinin nihai aşaması olarak gördü. **Auguste Comte** Comte'un pozitivizmi, bilimin ve rasyonalitenin toplum üzerindeki olumlu etkilerine odaklanır. Tüm bilimsel disiplinlerin bir hiyerarşisi olduğunu ve sosyolojinin bu hiyerarşinin en üstünde yer aldığını savunur. Comte için, sosyoloji, toplumsal olguları bilimsel yöntemlerle incelemeyi amaçlar, ve bu sayede toplumun ilerlemesi mümkün olur. **Viyana Çevresi** 20. yüzyılın başlarında Viyana Çevresi, pozitivizmi yeni bir boyuta taşıdı. Bu grup, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rudolf Carnap ve Moritz Schlick gibi filozofları içeriyordu. Viyana Çevresi'nin amacı, bilimi metafizikten arındırmak ve bilginin empirik doğrulanabilirliği üzerine konsantre olmaktı. Onlara göre, anlam taşıyan cümleler ya analitik (mantıksal açıdan doğru veya yanlış olan) ya da empirik (deney yoluyla test edilebilen) olmalıdır. Metafizik ifadeler ise bu iki kategoriye girmediği için anlamsız sayılır. **Lojik Pozitivizm** Viyana Çevresi tarafından geliştirilen lojik pozitivizm, pozitivizmin bir başka önemli evresidir. Bu yaklaşımda, bilimsel bilginin yanı sıra mantık ve matematik de önemli yer tutar. Lojik pozitivizm, bilim ve felsefenin sınırlarını çizmeye çalışır ve bu süreçte dil analizine büyük önem verir. Özellikle Wittgenstein'ın \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\\" adlı eseri, dilin sınırlarını ve düşüncenin nasıl ifade edilebileceğini tartışarak bu alanda önemli bir kaynak oluşturur. **20. Yüzyılın Sonları ve Günümüz** 20. yüzyılın ikinci yarısında, pozitivizm ciddi eleştirilere maruz kaldı. Özellikle Thomas Kuhn'un bilim felsefesi ve bilimin tarihsel gelişimi üzerine yaptığı çalışmalar, bilimsel bilginin kümülatif ve doğrusal bir biçimde ilerlemediğini, bilim tarihindeki paradigma değişimleri aracılığıyla evrildiğini savunur. Bu düşünceler, pozitivizmin katı normlarını sorgulattı ve bilimde ilerlemenin daha kompleks ve sosyal faktörlere bağlı olduğunu gösterdi. Günümüzde pozitivizm, klasik anlamda birçok eleştirinin hedefi olmuş olsa da, bilimsel yöntemin önemini ve objektif bilginin değerini vurgulayan bir yaklaşım olarak etkisini sürdürmektedir. Eleştirel pozitivizm ve post-pozitivizm gibi yeni çerçeveler, bilimin mutlak değil, sosyal ve tarihsel koşullar içerisinde şekillenen bir süreç olduğunu kabul eder. Bu yaklaşımlar, daha önce pozitivizmin ihmal ettiği boyutları - örneğin, bilimin toplumsal bağlamı ve değerlerin bilim üzerindeki etkileri - dahil ederek, pozitivizmin temel ilkelerini yeniden yorumlamaktadır. Sonuç olarak, pozitivizm modern bilim ve felsefe tarihinde önemli bir rol oynamış, fakat zaman içerisinde değişen bilimsel ve felsefi anlayışların ışığında evrilmiş ve dönüşmüştür."},{"prompt":"متن زیر را به فارسی تبدیل کن The big, often very uncomfortable, ideas run rampant in those disquieting categories, “minority” and “postcolonial” fiction. That’s nearly inevitable. How can a novel by an African American or African Caribbean writer not take stock of the legacy of slavery and racist mistreatment? How can an African or Indian novel, or any other from a former outpost of empire, not speak to, among other things, the experience of oppression or the chaos that so often follows when the oppressor withdraws? Chinua Achebe has a famous essay of complaint against Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, itself a pretty dense little novella of ideas, but his better rejoinders are his fiction from Things Fall Apart forward. The essay states his ideas; the novels embody them. History, as I suggest elsewhere, is the one inescapable fact. Stephen Dedalus’s “History is the nightmare from which I’m trying to awake,” is merely a sign of his callowness. Writers as outwardly different as Salman Rushdie, R. K. Narayan, Kiran Desai, Caryl Phillips, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Louise Erdrich, and Edward P. Jones have in common the making of fiction filled with ideas in response to what history has handed them. Jones shocked readers of all races with his novel of black slave￾owners, The Known World (2003), but that material ironically freed him to talk about issues of race, privilege, class, and right and wrong in ways that a conventional white-black slavery tale might not have. So, too, with Phillips, whose Cambridge (1991) is an astonishing experiment in voice, bringing together a nineteenth-century English woman sent to the West Indies to look over her father’s sugar plantation and the slave, freed and eventually resold into bondage, whose name gives the novel its title. What matters most, perhaps, in all these novels, and what makes the novel matter as a place for ideas, is the ability to bring broad ranges of experience down to the individual level. Groups don’t lead lives; persons do. Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children isn’t the story of “India” gaining independence; it’s the story of Saleem Sinai, one person, the family into which he is born, his experiences as an individual in an emerging nation. It is through him that the collective can be expressed. Right there is the genius of the novel form. It is the perfect medium for capturing individual existence, and in turn to be a near-perfect medium for capturing the experience of the group. The life of the ordinary person—right there is a big idea, the first one the novel ever had. The earlier literary forms were highly elitist. Tragedy and epic are both about the ruling class, although for rather different reasons. Comedy often had lesser nobility for characters; I can’t speak for you, but my ancestors would show up in Shakespeare, if at all, as the grave diggers and comic servants, the entirely expendable class whose stage time is counted in seconds. Even the lyric was intended for the leisured classes capable of reading—it had shepherds in it but wasn’t for (or even about) real shepherds. No, if your surname indicated the work you did or where you did it— Miller, Cooper, Smith, Farrier, Forester or Forster or Foster—you were excluded from the old literature. Then this new form comes along, catering to an emerging middle class and often about its members, and it’s capacious enough that there might be room in there for someone who actually works for a living. It’s still better to own things than do things, but it’s a start. No accident about it, though: the rise of the novel coincides with the rise of a middle class, and of liberty, and of democracy. This is a form in which ordinary people just might matter. But it’s not about a class, only about individual members thereof. In fact, it’s the first form in the history of Western civilization to suggest that a single person might actually matter in the grand scheme even if that person doesn’t wear a crown. What a concept! You doubt? What do these people have in common: Tom Jones, Clarissa, Huck Finn, Jay Gatsby, George Babbitt, Augie March, Bridget Jones, Emma, Silas Lapham, Don Quixote? Eponymous characters all; that is, they give their names to the titles of novels in which they play starring roles. When did that happen before? Oedipus? Hamlet? King Lear, for crying out loud? If you wanted a title on the stage, you needed royal blood. The novel, on the other hand, goes for red blood rather than blue. This constitutes a huge change not only in literature but in the history of ideas. This chapter seems to suggest that the twentieth century has a lock on idea-centered fiction, which is too bad. Ideas, and important ones, have been invigorating fiction since its beginning, and one idea above all others. Sure, Thomas Hardy’s cosmic doubt or Dostoevsky’s investigations of man and God or of crime and punishment are indubitably philosophical, but so is Henry Fielding’s comic narrative of the foundling Tom Jones and his attempt to find his place in the world. And so is Dashiell Hammett’s mystery with a detective named Spade, digging, maybe reluctantly, for the truth.","completion":"ایده‌های بزرگ و بسیار ناراحت کننده در آن دسته‌های آشفته \\"اقلیت\\" و \\"داستان پسااستعماری\\" به وفور یافت می‌شوند. این تقریبا اجتناب‌ناپذیر است. چگونه می‌توان از رمانی نوشته شده توسط یک نویسنده آفریقایی-آمریکایی یا آفریقایی-کارائیبی انتظار نداشت که به میراث برده‌داری و بی‌عدالتی نژادپرستانه پرداخته باشد؟ چگونه یک رمان آفریقایی یا هندی، یا هر رمان دیگری از یک پایگاه سابق امپراطوری، نمی‌تواند به تجربه ستم یا هرج و مرجی که غالباً پس از خروج ستمگر پیش می‌آید، بپردازد؟ چینوآ آچه‌به یک مقاله معروف در شکایت از \\"قلب تاریکی\\" نوشته جوزف کنراد دارد، که خود یک رمان کوچک و مملو از ایده است، اما پاسخ‌های بهتر او رمان‌هایش از \\"وقتی همه چیز فرو می‌پاشد\\" به بعد است. مقاله ایده‌های او را بیان می‌دارد؛ رمان‌ها آنها را جسمیت می‌بخشند. تاریخ، همانطور که من در جای دیگری پیشنهاد می‌کنم، واقعیتی است که نمی‌توان از آن فرار کرد. \\"تاریخ کابوسی است که من سعی در بیدار شدن از آن دارم\\" اثر استیون ددالوس، تنها نشانه‌ای از جوانی او است. نویسندگانی به ظاهر متفاوت مانند سلمان رشدی، آر. کِی. نارایان، کیران دسای، کاریل فلیپس، تونی موریسون، آلیس واکر، لوئیز اردریچ و ادوارد پی. جونز این مشترک را دارند که داستان‌هایی پر از ایده را در پاسخ به آنچه تاریخ به آنها سپرده، خلق کرده‌اند. جونز خوانندگان از همه نژادها را با رمان خود درباره صاحبان برده سیاه‌پوست، \\"دنیای شناخته شده\\" (۲۰۰۳) شگفت‌زده کرد، اما این موضوع به طور آیرونیک او را آزاد کرد تا درباره مسائل نژاد، امتیاز، طبقه، و درست و غلط به شیوه‌ای صحبت کند که یک داستان سنتی برده‌داری سفید-سیاه شاید نمی‌توانست. همچنین با فلیپس، که \\"کمبریج\\" (۱۹۹۱) او یک آزمایش شگفت‌انگیز در صدا است، زنی انگلیسی قرن نوزدهمی را که به جزایر غربی فرستاده شده بود تا به مزرعه قند پدرش نگاهی بیندازد و برده‌ای که آزاد و نهایتاً دوباره به بردگی فروخته شد، نامی که رمان بر اساس آن نامگذاری شده، را به هم پیوند می‌دهد. شاید آنچه بیش از همه در این رمان‌ها اهمیت دارد، و آنچه که رمان را به مکانی برای ایده‌ها اهمیت می‌بخشد، توانایی آنها برای تجربه‌های گسترده را به سطح فردی کشاندن است. گروه‌ها زندگی نمی‌کنند؛ افراد زندگی می‌کنند. \\"فرزندان نیمه‌شب\\" اثر رشدی داستان \\"هند\\" به دست آوردن استقلال نیست؛ داستان سلیم سینای، یک فرد، خانواده‌ای که او در آن به دنیا آمده، تجربیات او به عنوان یک فرد در یک ملت در حال ظهور است. از طریق او است که می‌توان جمعی را بیان کرد. درست در همانجا نبوغ فرم رمان قرار دارد. این رسانه‌ای کامل برای ضبط وجود فردی است، و به نوبه خود تقریبا رسانه‌ای نزدیک به کامل برای درک تجربه گروه است. زندگی فرد عادی—درست در همانجا یک ایده بزرگ وجود دارد، اولین ایده‌ای که رمان تا به حال داشته است. اشکال ادبی پیشین بسیار نخبه‌گرا بودند. تراژدی و حماسه هر دو درباره طبقه حاکم هستند، اگرچه به دلایل متفاوت. کمدی اغلب اشراف پایین‌تر را به عنوان شخصیت‌ها داشت؛ من نمی‌توانم در مورد شما صحبت کنم، اما اجداد من، در صورت وجود در شکسپیر، به عنوان کندوکاوکنندگان قبر و خدمتکاران کمدی، طبقه کاملاً قابل حذفی که زمان صحنه‌ی آنها به ثانیه‌ها شمرده می‌شود، ظاهر می‌شدند. حتی غزل نیز برای طبقات فراغت بخش که قادر به خواندن بودند، در نظر گرفته شده بود - شاعران چوپان را داشت اما برای (یا حتی درباره) چوپان‌های واقعی نبود. نه، اگر نام خانوادگی شما کاری را که انجام می‌دادید یا جایی که آن را انجام می‌دادید نشان می‌داد - میلر، کوپر، اسمیت، فریر، فارستر یا فاستر - از ادبیات قدیمی محروم بودید. سپس این فرم جدید پدیدار می‌شود، که به طبقه متوسط در حال ظهور خدمت می‌کند و غالباً درباره اعضای آن است، و به اندازه کافی گنجایش دارد که ممکن است در آنجا جایی برای کسی باشد که واقعاً برای زندگی‌اش کار می‌کند. هنوز هم بهتر است چیزهایی را داشته باشید تا کارهایی انجام دهید، اما این یک شروع است. اما اتفاقی در کار نیست: ظهور رمان همزمان است با ظهور طبقه متوسط، و آزادی، و دموکراسی. این یک فرم است که افراد عادی ممکن است اهمیت داشته باشند. اما درباره یک طبقه نیست، تنها درباره اعضای فردی آن است. در واقع، این اولین فرم در تاریخ تمدن غربی است که پیشنهاد می‌کند یک فرد تنها ممکن است در نقشه بزرگ اهمیت داشته باشد حتی اگر آن فرد تاجی بر سر نداشته باشد. چه مفهومی! شک دارید؟ این افراد چه مشترکی دارند: تام جونز، کلاریسا، هاک فین، جی گتسبی، جورج ببیت، آگی مارچ، بریجت جونز، اما، سیلاس لافام، دن کیشوت؟ همگی شخصیت‌های اپونیم هستند؛ به این معنا که نام‌هایشان به عناوین رمان‌هایی که در آنها نقش‌های اصلی را بازی می‌کنند، داده شده است. این قبلاً کی اتفاق افتاده بود؟ ادیپوس؟ هملت؟ شاه لیر، به خاطر خدا؟ اگر می‌خواستید در صحنه عنوانی داشته باشید، به خون سلطنتی نیاز داشتید. رمان، از سوی دیگر، به خون قرمز بیشتر از خون آبی توجه دارد. این تغییر عظیمی نه تنها در ادبیات بلکه در تاریخ ایده‌ها ایجاد می‌کند. این فصل به نظر می‌رسد که پیشنهاد می‌کند قرن بیستم بر داستان محوری ایده قفل دارد، که خیلی بد است. ایده‌ها، و ایده‌های مهم، از ابتدای آن داستان‌نویسی را تقویت کرده‌اند، و یک ایده بیش از دیگران. البته، شک‌های کیهانی توماس هاردی یا تحقیقات داستوفسکی درباره انسان و خدا یا جرم و مجازات کاملاً فلسفی هستند، اما روایت کمیک هنری فیلدینگ از یتیم تام جونز و تلاش او برای یافتن جایگاهش در دنیا نیز همینطور است. و همچنین تحقیقات داشیل همت با یک کارآگاه به نام اسپید، که شاید با اکراه، به دنبال حقیقت است."},{"prompt":"August Comte ile başlayan ve daha sonra Viyana çevresi filozofları tarafından sürdürülen pozitivizmin tarihi gelişimini, geçirdiği dönüşümleri ve günümüzde aldığı hali bu konuda en çok etkili olan felsefecilerin adları üzerinden analiz et.

Bu düşünce akımı zaman içinde değişik evrelerden geçmiş ve farklı filozoflar tarafından şekillendirilmiştir. # Auguste Comte (1798-1857) Pozitivizmin kurucusu olan Comte, bu düşünce sistemini üç aşamalı bir tarih felsefesi içinde açıklar: Teolojik, metafizik ve pozitif. Bu evrimsel sürecin sonunda, insanlığın pozitif bilime dayanan bir düşünce sistemiyle en olgun aşamaya ulaşacağını savunur. Ona göre, pozitif bilim, gerçekleri prediktif bir şekilde açıklama gücüne sahiptir ve toplumun ilerlemesi için gerekli düzleme ulaşmasını sağlar. # John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) Comte’un çağdaşı ve muhafazakar bir eleştirmeni olan Mill, pozitivizmin bilimsel yöntem üzerine vurgusunu desteklerken, Comte'un sıkı yapılanmasını ve bilim dışı düşünceye kategorik ret yaklaşımını eleştirir. Mill, bilimin yanı sıra, ahlak ve siyaset felsefesinde de empirik bir yaklaşımın önemini vurgular. # Ernst Mach (1838-1916) ve Lojik Pozitivistler Comparatively later, Ernst Mach ve Viyana Çevresi filozofları pozitivizmi yeni bir aşamaya taşıdılar. Mach, bilimin sadece gözlemlenebilir ve ölçülebilir olgulara dayanması gerektiğini savundu. Viyana Çevresi (örneğin, Rudolf Carnap, Moritz Schlick ve diğerleri), pozitivizmi \\"lojik pozitivizm\\" (veya \\"lojik empirizm\\") olarak daha da geliştirdi. Onlar, metafizik ifadelerin anlamsız olduğunu ve bilim felsefesinin dili ile mantığı açıkça analiz etmesi gerektiğini savundular. Bu düşünce, sadece doğrulanabilir (ya da falsifiye edilebilir) ifadelerin anlam taşıdığı fikrine dayanır. # Karl Popper (1902-1994) Karl Popper, lojik pozitivistlerin doğrulama ilkesi üzerine temellendirdiği eleştirileriyle tanınır. Popper, bilimsel teorilerin asla tam olarak doğrulanamayacağını, ancak yanlışlanabileceğini (falsifiye) savunur. Bu bağlamda, Popper pozitivizme önemli bir eleştiri sunar ve bilimin ilerlemesinin temelindeki mekanizmanın yanlışlamacılık olduğunu öne sürer. # Günümüzde Pozitivizm Günümüzde pozitivizm, yukarıda adı geçen düşünürlerin çalışmaları ve tartışmaları sayesinde önemli dönüşümler geçirmiştir. Özellikle bilim felsefesindeki gelişmeler ve sosyal bilimlerdeki uygulamalar, pozitivizmin katı kurallarını yumuşatmış ve daha geniş bir bilimsel anlayışa yer açmıştır. Bir yandan, modern bilim ve teknoloji, Comte'un pozitif bilime olan inancını destekler nitelikte ilerlemeler sağlamışken, öte yandan, bilginin yapısı, doğasına ve sınırlarına dair felsefi sorular, pozitivizmin en katı yorumlarının ötesine geçen bir düşünce alanı yaratmıştır.

allTests","completion":"Given the Haskell code you've posted, there are several key functionalities implemented along with test placeholders for expression evaluation and postfix expressions parsing. However, you seem to have several issues and unfinished parts in your code. To guide you in the right direction, let's address some of the areas that need attention: 1. **Test Implementations**: The placeholders for test cases (\`testEvalIntExpr\`, \`testEvalIdExpr\`, \`testEvalMaybeExpr\`, \`testPostfixExpr\`) are empty. Test cases should be added to thoroughly evaluate the correctness of implemented functions. 2. **ParseError**: The \`parseToken\` and \`parseString\` functions incorporate error handling for parsing operations, but the usage of these functions and the pattern matching for error handling could be refined based on error handling strategies (e.g., Either Monad). 3. **Implementation of \`parseString\` Function**: The part of the \`parseString\` function that checks for unary minus and numeric values seems to be incomplete or uses invalid Haskell syntax (\`(':rest') & notFollowedBy ('-')\`). Haskell does not have a built-in function called \`notFollowedBy\` in this context. This likely refers to a feature in some parsing libraries like Parsec, but the usage here is incorrect. Instead, specific patterns should be matched, and for complex logic, a parsing library or more granular pattern matching should be used. 4. **Evaluation Functions**: The implementations of \`evalIntExpr\`, \`evalIdExpr\`, \`evalMaybeExpr\`, and the related data types (\`IntExpr\`, \`IdExpr\`, \`MaybeExpr\`) are incomplete, as the code does not include definitions for these data types. Without them, it's impossible to determine whether the evaluation functions are correctly implemented. 5. **Pattern Matching in \`parseString\`**: The pattern matching in \`parseString\` should specifically match on the format of the numbers and not just any character followed by \`:rest\`. For input validation and parsing, consider using more robust methods or libraries like Read for simple cases or full parsing libraries like Parsec or Megaparsec for complex inputs. 6. **General Improvements**: The overall structure could benefit from error handling improvements, more comprehensive test cases, and usage of Haskell's advanced type systems and libraries for parsing and evaluation. 7. **Complexity in \`selectNApart\`**: The \`selectNApart\` function is not the most efficient or clear in its intent. Depending on what you're trying to achieve (e.g., separating a list into chunks of 'n' elements), there might be more straightforward methods or existing library functions that can perform the task. To fix these issues, start by: - Writing test cases for all testing functions using valid inputs and asserting expected outcomes. - Reviewing and correcting the parsing functions (\`parseToken\`, \`parseString\`) for accurate and efficient string parsing. - Defining or correcting the data types (\`IntExpr\`, \`IdExpr\`, \`MaybeExpr\`, \`PostfixExpr\`) if they are intended to be used in your code. - Refactoring the code with a focus on clarity, error handling, and leveraging Haskell's features like pattern matching, monads (for dealing with errors and computations), and parsing libraries for more complex string processing tasks."},{"prompt":"Fix the issues and write the code","completion":"Given the issues identified earlier, let's address and rewrite some key parts of your Haskell code, although it's worth noting that without full context or definitions for some data types and modules (\`TestUtils\`, \`EvalIntExpr\`, \`EvalIdExpr\`, \`EvalMaybeExpr\`, \`PostfixExpr\`), we have to make assumptions or omit parts of it. # Corrected Code Example First, we'll need to define or assume the existence of the \`IntExpr\`, \`IdExpr\`, and \`MaybeExpr\` data types, as they are referenced but not defined in your code. Let's simplify the task to focus on key functional parts like \`parseString\` simplification and providing some basic illustrative test cases. **Postfix Expression Parser**: The following provides a simplified approach to parsing postfix expressions into a custom data structure. Note that handling unary minus directly within the parsing of numbers is complex without a fuller parsing context and is thus omitted here in favor of focusing on the core functionality. \`\`\`haskell module Main where -- Assuming the existence or importing necessary libraries import Control.Applicative -- PostfixExpr represents an arithmetic expression in postfix notation data PostfixExpr = Leaf Int | Add PostfixExpr PostfixExpr | Sub PostfixExpr PostfixExpr | Mul PostfixExpr PostfixExpr | Uminus PostfixExpr deriving (Eq, Show) -- Parses a list of tokens into a PostfixExpr; tokens are expected to be space-separated postfixExpr :: String -> Either String PostfixExpr postfixExpr s = case expr of ([result], []) -> Right result _ -> Left \\"Invalid postfix expression\\" where tokens = words s expr = foldl parseToken ([], tokens) tokens parseToken (stack, []) token = (stack, []) parseToken (stack, (t:ts)) token | t == \\"+\\" = binaryOp Add stack ts | t == \\"-\\" = binaryOp Sub stack ts | t == \\"*\\" = binaryOp Mul stack ts | t == \\"uminus\\" = unaryOp Uminus stack ts | otherwise = (Leaf (read t) : stack, ts) binaryOp op (x:y:ys) ts = (op y x : ys, ts) binaryOp _ _ _ = error \\"Invalid operation\\" unaryOp op (x:xs) ts = (op x : xs, ts) unaryOp _ _ _ = error \\"Invalid operation\\" main :: IO () main = print postfixExpr \\"3 4 + 2 * 7 -\\" \`\`\` Since the question was specific about corrections and provided incomplete details, especially around testing and evaluation functions, the above sample addresses the postfix expression parsing. The parsing logic has been simplified to provide an approach that avoids detailed pattern matching on strings, which was one of the problematic parts in the original submission. For a more comprehensive solution, including detailed test cases, definition, and implementation of the evaluation functions (\`evalIntExpr\`, \`evalIdExpr\`, \`evalMaybeExpr\`), and leveraging Haskell features or specific libraries for parsing (like Parsec or Megaparsec), a more extensive codebase and context would be required. This would involve: - Defining the \`IntExpr\`, \`IdExpr\`, and \`MaybeExpr\` types and their constructors. - Implementing the evaluation logic for these types. - Writing comprehensive test cases for each logical part of the code, including handling different kinds of inputs and edge cases. Given that Haskell is a statically typed, pure functional programming language, leveraging types for ensuring correctness at compile time and using functional paradigms for clear, concise, and correct code are key practices. For parsing tasks or more advanced features, the community's vast ecosystem of libraries offers robust solutions for many common programming needs."},{"prompt":"how long in inches in the face of a cube that is 2 cubic feet of space.","completion":"To find the length of one side of a cube that has a volume of 2 cubic feet, we use the formula for the volume of a cube, which is ( V = s^3 ), where ( V ) is the volume and ( s ) is the length of a side of the cube.

To convert this to inches, note that there are 12 inches in a foot. Thus, [ s_{inches} = 12 times sqrt[3]{2} ] [ s_{inches} ≈ 12 times 1.2599 ] [ s_{inches} ≈ 15.12 ] Therefore, the length of each side of the cube is approximately 15.12 inches."},{"prompt":"what if it were a cube of 10 cubic feet","completion":"For a cube with a volume of 10 cubic feet, you use the same formula for the volume of a cube, ( V = s^3 ), where ( V ) is the volume and ( s ) is the length of one side of the cube.

Neutron stars are incredibly dense remnants of collapsed stars, with immense gravitational fields and emitting intense radiation. Any life form originating or living near a neutron star would be radically different from life as we know it. To envision a polyamorous sophont species in such an extreme environment, let's consider theoretical adaptations and societal structures that could allow for complex relationships and social interactions in the harsh conditions near a neutron star. # Species Name: Astralites # Environment and Biology: - **Radiation Resistance:** Astralites possess an extraordinarily advanced cellular repair mechanism that allows them to withstand and repair damage from the intense radiation found near neutron stars. - **Gravitationally Adapted:** Their bodies are adapted to withstand extreme gravitational forces without being crushed, potentially having an exoskeleton made of exotic, superdense materials. - **Energy Consumption:** Instead of traditional food, they might feed directly on the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the neutron star, converting it into energy through a process akin to photosynthesis. - **Communication:** In such an environment, communication might rely on neutrino emissions or gravitational waves, which can propagate through the intense magnetic and gravitational fields unimpeded. # Social Structure: Polyamorous Relationships: - **Dynamic Bonds:** Astralites form complex, polyamorous relationships that are dynamic and adapt to the challenges of their environment. Their relationships are not solely based on reproduction (which may involve a unique, perhaps communal process given their possibly non-binary reproductive strategies) but also on mutual support, resource sharing, and emotional bonding. - **Cooperative Parenting:** The communal care of offspring, if they have them in a traditional sense, is common, with children being raised by multiple adults from different relationship groups. This not only ensures the survival of their young in the harsh environment but also strengthens communal ties. - **Complex Emotional Intelligence:** To navigate their intricate relationships, Astralites have evolved a highly developed emotional intelligence, allowing for deep empathic connections and communication. This aids in maintaining harmony within their polyamorous networks and ensuring collective well-being. - **Social Structures:** Their societies are likely to be highly collaborative, with decisions made collectively to adapt to the rapidly changing and harsh conditions near a neutron star. Their social systems could be based on principles that emphasize mutual support, flexibility, and the sharing of responsibilities and resources. # Challenges and Adaptations: Living near a neutron star presents numerous challenges, such as extreme gravity, magnetic fields, and radiation. The Astralites' polyamorous nature and social structures could be seen as adaptations to these challenges, fostering a strong sense of community and collaboration essential for survival in such an unforgiving environment. # Concluding Thoughts: The Astralites represent a speculative exploration into how life, and particularly complex social and emotional life, might adapt to the extreme conditions near neutron stars. While purely theoretical, imagining such species encourages us to expand our understanding of the possibilities for life in the universe and the diverse forms that social and familial relationships might take."},{"prompt":"Olá, você fala Português?","completion":"Sim, falo Português.

Given the extreme conditions of a neutron star - incredibly dense matter, intense gravity, and strong magnetic fields - any life form or civilization imagined in this context would have to be speculative and highly adapted to such an extreme environment. Due to the speculative nature of this description, we will venture into science fiction. Let’s conceptualize a species named the Neutrids, hypothetical sophonts living in the crust of a neutron star or in its vicinity, perhaps in a form of exotic matter halo or structure that defies our current understanding of physics. # Physical Attributes The Neutrids would likely have no physical form as we understand it, given that the material conditions of a neutron star would not support conventional biological life. Instead, they could exist as patterns of neutronium or perhaps as complex magnetic flux lines. Their 'bodies' might be areas of structured neutron degenerate matter, capable of hosting consciousness by manipulating quantum states or fluctuating magnetic fields. # Environment Their habitat would be unimaginably hostile to human life - a realm of extreme gravity, where a sugar-cube-sized amount of matter weighs as much as all of humanity, and magnetic fields millions to billions of times stronger than Earth’s. These conditions may, however, be the perfect cradle for the Neutrids, facilitating their energy needs and information processing. # Society and Culture Assuming the Neutrids have developed a complex society within such an environment, it stands to reason that their civilization would be fundamentally different from anything humans know. Being polyamorous, the Neutrids likely have complex relationships that are not limited by human concepts of family or partnership. They might form intricate networks of emotional and intellectual bonds, transcending physical limits through shared experiences or unified consciousness across the magnetic fields. # Communication and Interaction Communication amongst Neutrids might occur through modulation of magnetic fields, quantum entanglement, or fluctuations in neutron density. These methods would allow them to convey not only thoughts and ideas but possibly also emotions, making their interactions deeply nuanced and multidimensional. # Reproduction and Continuity Reproduction or the propagation of their kind could be a process of sharing and splitting patterns of consciousness, or perhaps creating new 'individuals' through the combination of 'genetic' data encoded in magnetic or quantum states. This process may often involve multiple Neutrids, aligning with their polyamorous nature, as the mix and match of cognitive and conscious elements from several parents could be considered ideal for creating offspring. # Challenges and Adaptations Living in such an extreme environment, the Neutrids might face challenges we can barely imagine, such as fluctuations in neutron star crustal composition, starquakes, or changes in the magnetic field intensity. Their adaptations to these challenges, developed over eons, would likely be as extraordinary as their environment, potentially involving abilities to rapidly alter their physical or quantum state, migrate through the crust or magnetic fields, or enter states of reduced activity during adverse conditions. # Conclusion The idea of a polyamorous sophont species existing in the conditions of a neutron star pushes the boundaries of our understanding of life and consciousness. It opens intriguing possibilities for exploring the diversity of life that might exist in the universe, beyond the confines of traditional biological frameworks, and challenges us to think about the myriad ways intelligence and societies could evolve in the cosmos."},{"prompt":"كلام صغير جداً جدا جدا عن الوفاء وعن عدم طعن الظهور وعن بيع الرجال وعن الخيانه والغدر وعن الوفاء بالوفاء وعن الشخص

Its primary aim is to provide guidance on creating information and communication technology (ICT) products and services that are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. **Background and Development:** The standard evolved from the British Standard BS 8878:2010 \\"Web accessibility. Code of practice\\" and was developed to have a broader international application and relevance. The transfer from a British Standard to an International one signifies the global importance of digital accessibility, reflecting the wider applicability of the practices beyond the web to include all ICT products and services. **Key Features:** 1. **Framework for Accessibility:** ISO 30071-1 provides a comprehensive framework for organizations to follow, ensuring that digital products and services are accessible. This includes guidelines for planning, implementing, and reviewing accessibility throughout the design and development processes. 2. **Inclusive Design Principles:** The standard advocates for the application of inclusive design principles, which means considering the diverse needs and preferences of all potential users from the beginning of the development process. 3. **User Involvement:** It emphasizes the importance of involving people with disabilities in the development process, ensuring that ICT products and services are tested by the very users they aim to support. 4. **Documentation and Policies:** Organizations are encouraged to develop policies and procedures for creating accessible ICT, including maintaining records of decisions made regarding accessibility and the rationale behind these decisions. 5. **Legal Compliance:** While ISO 30071-1 is a voluntary standard and not mandated by law, following its guidelines can help organizations comply with legal requirements related to accessibility in many jurisdictions. This is especially relevant given the increasing global emphasis on digital accessibility in legislation. **Implementation:** Organizations seeking to implement ISO 30071-1 should start by familiarizing themselves with the standard and assessing their current accessibility maturity level. The standard is applicable to a wide range of organizations regardless of their size or the nature of their ICT products and services. Implementing the standard involves setting accessibility goals, involving users with disabilities, adapting design processes to include accessibility considerations, and conducting regular reviews to ensure ongoing compliance and improvement. **Impact:** Adopting ISO 30071-1 demonstrates an organization's commitment to social responsibility, inclusivity, and legal compliance. It has the potential not only to broaden the user base by making digital products and services accessible to people with disabilities but also to improve usability for all users. **Conclusion:** ISO 30071-1 is a significant step forward in making the digital world more accessible. By providing a structured approach to incorporating accessibility into ICT product and service development, it plays a crucial role in breaking down barriers and enabling full participation in the digital age for everyone, including people with disabilities."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

Neste caso, a música é um clássico do hip-hop do início dos anos 2000, caracterizada por seu ritmo contagiante, base minimalista e linhas de baixo marcantes. Embora eu não consiga criar áudio ou música propriamente dita, aqui estão algumas diretrizes gerais sobre como alguém poderia abordar a criação de um beat que complemente a música: # 1. **Base Rítmica:** - **Kick (Bumbo):** Comece com um kick forte e claro, proporcionando uma base sólida. O kick deveria ter um bom impacto nos graves, com um toque ligeiramente seco. - **Snare (Caixa):** Um snare nítido e firme a cada segunda batida do compasso dá ao hip-hop seu ritmo inconfundível. Uma leve reverberação pode adicionar espacialidade sem exagero. - **Hi-Hats:** Use hi-hats para criar uma sensação de movimento e urgência, alternando entre padrões regulares e tripletos para variedade. # 2. **Linhas de Baixo:** - A linha de baixo é crucial. Um baixo sintetizado, com tons profundos e um padrão que segue a batida, mas também adiciona suas próprias nuances, pode enriquecer a track. Sua linha de baixo deve ser simples mas cativante, talvez repetindo uma sequência de notas que ressoa com o refrão. # 3. **Elementos Melódicos:** - **Synths (Sintetizadores):** Elementos melódicos sutis podem ser adicionados para dar cor à música, mas mantê-los em um nível mais discreto para não ofuscar o vocal e a batida principal. - **Samples:** A integração de um sample memorável, seja de um instrumento musical como um piano sutilmente tocado ou um sample vocal, pode aumentar a identidade da faixa. # 4. **Efeitos e Textura Sonora:** - **Reverb e Echo (Eco):** Use com moderação em determinados elementos, como o snare ou os synths, para adicionar profundidade. - **Panning:** Utilize o panning (distribuição do som entre os canais esquerdo e direito) para criar uma sensação de espaço e dinamismo. # 5. **Breaks e Variações:** - Incorpore pequenas variações no beat, ou até mesmo uma quebra instrumental onde a batida muda temporariamente, para manter o ouvinte engajado e dar ao artista espaços para criar tensão e alívio. # 6. **Polimento Final:** - **Mixagem:** Uma boa mixagem é crucial. Garanta que cada elemento do beat esteja bem equilibrado, nenhum som deveria sobrepor o outro sem intenção. - **Masterização:** A masterização final deve considerar o nível desejado de pressão sonora sem perder a dinâmica natural da faixa. Cada um desses pontos oferece uma direção para criar um beat que complemente uma música como \\"Just a Lil Bit\\". A chave é experimentar e ajustar até que você sinta que a batida suporta adequadamente a entrega vocal e a atmosfera lírica, proporcionando uma experiência auditiva envolvente e memorável."},{"prompt":"Crie uma musica de funk ostentaçao","completion":"Claro, vou esboçar uma ideia de letra para uma música de funk ostentação, um gênero que exalta conquistas materiais, luxo e sucesso. Lembre-se de que o funk ostentação é conhecido por seus ritmos dançantes e suas letras que celebram a ascensão social e econômica. Aqui vai um exemplo de uma letra fictícia que você poderia adaptar ou expandir conforme desejar: --- **Título: No Topo do Mundo** (Beat começa com um ritmo cativante de funk) **Verso 1:** De rolê na cidade, carro do ano, Som no último volume, eu comando.

Meus sonhos reais, grife no peito, Sucesso é chave, e eu já tenho o jeito. (Beat diminui, cria suspense) **Pré-refrão:** Flash das câmeras, tapete vermelho, Pulseira de diamante, cada detalhe belo. Não foi da noite pro dia, foi trajetória, Cada verso que escrevo, grava minha história. (Refrão repete) **Ponte:** De onde eu vim, me orgulho e falo, Cada degrau, cada passo, não me calo. Do nada ao tudo, viro o jogo, Funk ostentação, com meu nome eu assino. **Breakdown instrumental de Funk** (Refrão repete com mais intensidade) **Outro:** No topo do mundo, a festa não tem fim, Ostentação e funk, é o que me faz assim.

Yani, doğa bilimlerini tek ve en büyük otorite kabul eden, buna karşın empirik bilgiye dayanmayan her türden metafiziği ise kategorik olarak reddeden felsefe ekolü olan pozitivzmin evrimini analiz et.","completion":"Pozitivizm, August Comte ile ortaya çıkan ve bilimsel bilgiyi tek geçerli bilgi olarak kabul eden bir felsefi akımın adıdır. Comte, bu düşüncenin temellerini 19. yüzyılın ortalarında atmış ve zamanla bu görüş, özellikle doğa bilimleri alanındaki başarılardan güç alarak geniş bir yelpazede yayılmıştır. Pozitivizmin gelişimi, farklı filozoflar ve akımlar tarafından birçok dönüşüme uğramıştır. Bu yazıda, pozitivizmin temel hatlarını, tarihsel gelişimini ve günümüzdeki yansımalarını etkili olan felsefeciler üzerinden inceleyeceğiz. # August Comte ve Pozitivizmin Doğuşu Pozitivizm, August Comte tarafından bilginin ve bilimsel metodun yüceltilmesi amacıyla kurulmuştur. Comte'a göre bilim, toplumun ilerlemesi için temel araçtır ve bilimsel araştırma yöntemleri, gerçekliği anlamanın tek geçerli yoludur. Comte, bilginin üç aşamalı bir evrim içinde geliştiğini öne sürmüş, bunlar; teolojik, metafizik ve pozitif aşamalardır. Pozitif aşamada bilgi, doğa yasalarının gözlem ve deney yoluyla anlaşılmasını içerir. # John Stuart Mill ile Genişleme John Stuart Mill, Comte'un pozitivizmine daha fazla empirizm ve mantık ekleyerek bu fikirleri İngiliz düşünce dünyasına tanıttı. Mill, deneyim ve mantık yoluyla elde edilen bilginin önemini vurgulayarak, pozitivizmi sosyal bilimlerle uyumlu hale getiren önemli kişilerden biri oldu. # Ernst Mach ve Empiriokritisizm 19. yüzyılın sonlarına doğru Ernst Mach, pozitivizmi daha da ileri götürerek bilimin ampirik verilerle sınırlı olması gerektiğini savundu. Mach, metafiziği tamamen reddederek, bilimsel teorilerin yalnızca deneyimle doğrulanabilir olması gerektiğini öne sürdü. # Viyana Çevresi ve Mantıksal Pozitivizm 20. yüzyılın başında, Viyana Çevresi olarak bilinen bir grup filozof ve bilim insanı, pozitivizmi yeni bir aşamaya taşıdı. Öncüleri arasında Rudolf Carnap, Moritz Schlick ve Otto Neurath gibi isimlerin yer aldığı bu akım, mantıksal pozitivizm olarak adlandırıldı. Mantıksal pozitivizm, yalnızca doğrulanabilir ifadelerin anlamlı olduğunu savunarak, metafiziksel ve teolojik ifadeleri anlamsız kabul etti. Bu grup, bilimsel dilin sıkılığını ve mantığını vurgulayarak, bilimin felsefi temellerini inşa etmeye çalıştı. # Popper ve Falsifikasyon Karl Popper, pozitivizmin sıkı doğrulanabilirlik kriterini eleştirdi ve bilimsel teorilerin kesin olarak doğrulanamayacağını, ancak yanlışlanabilir olmaları gerektiğini savundu. Popper'a göre, bir teorinin bilimsel olması için, o teoriyi yanlışlayabilecek koşulların olasılığı olmalıdır. Popper, bu görüşleriyle pozitivizmi eleştirirken, bilimin ilerlemesine yapıcı bir katkı sağladı. # Günümüz Pozitivizmi Günümüzde pozitivizm, bilim felsefesindeki pek çok tartışmanın temelinde yatan bir görüş olmaya devam ediyor. Ancak, ilk şekillerinden önemli ölçüde dönüşüme uğramış ve farklı akımlara evrilmiştir. Örneğin, bilimdeki teorik modellerin ve simülasyonların artan önemi, pozitivizmin kesin doğrulanabilirlik ve empirizm üzerine kurulu ilkelerini zorlamaktadır. Sonuç olarak, pozitivizm, August Comte ile başlayıp, Viyana Çevresi, John Stuart Mill, Ernst Mach, Karl Popper gibi filozofların katkılarıyla gelişen bir akımdır. Bilimsel bilgi ve metodolojinin yüceltilmesi temeline dayalı bu düşünce sistemi, metafiziği ve teolojiyi reddetme noktasında ısrarlı olmuştur. Zaman içinde, çeşitli eleştiriler ve yeni teorilerle şekillenen pozitivizm, günümüz bilim felsefesinin temel taşlarından biri olmaya devam etmektedir."},{"prompt":"Dini ya da din dışı her türden metafizik ya da ideolojik önkabule (tek tanrılı dinler, Marksizm vb.) karşı kuşkuculuğu esas alan ve değişen somut koşulları analiz ederek sürekli bir yenilenmeyi, adaptasyonu, evrimi ilke edinen, \\"dün dündür, bugün bugündür.\\" ifadesiyle özetleyeceğimiz gerçekçi dünya görüşü hangi felsefe ile uyumludur ve bu düşüncenin ekonomik, siyaset, bilim, kültür alanlarındaki yansımaları nelerdir?","completion":"Bu tarif ettiğiniz dünya görüşü, pragmatizm ile uyumlu görünmektedir. Pragmatizm, 19. yüzyılın sonlarında Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'nde ortaya çıkan, pratik sonuçları ve işleyişleri üzerinden fikirlerin ve inançların değerini ölçen felsefi bir akımdır. Charles Sanders Peirce, William James ve John Dewey gibi filozoflar bu akımın en öne çıkan isimlerindendir. Pragmatizm, bir fikrin veya inancın gerçek değerinin, o fikrin veya inancın pratikte nasıl uygulandığına ve somut sonuçlarına bağlı olduğunu savunur. \\"Dün dündür, bugün bugündür\\" ifadesi pragmatizmin sürekli değişen koşullara ve sonuç odaklı düşünmeye verdiği önemi vurgular. # Ekonomi Pragmatizm, ekonomi alanında, piyasa koşullarının ve ekonomik politikaların sürekli değişen ihtiyaçlara göre uyarlanması gerektiğini savunabilir. Örneğin, pragmatist bir ekonomi politikası, herhangi bir ideolojik katılığı reddeder ve yalnızca somut ekonomik veriler ve gerçekler ışığında en etkili politikaların benimsenmesini destekler. # Siyaset Siyasette pragmatizm, ideolojik körlük yerine, gerçekçi ve esnek yaklaşımları teşvik eder. Pragmatist siyaset, kararların ve politikaların pratik sonuçlarına odaklanır ve ideolojik ön yargılardan arınmış bir şekilde toplumsal sorunları çözmeye çalışır. Bu yaklaşım, sürekli değişen toplumsal ihtiyaçlara ve koşullara en uygun cevapların bulunması gerektiğini savunur. # Bilim Bilimde pragmatizm, araştırma ve bulguların pratik uygulamalarını ve topluma olan katkılarını ön plana çıkartır. Bir teorinin değeri, o teorinin gerçek dünyaya nasıl uygulandığına ve somut problem çözme kabiliyetine dayanır. Bu yaklaşım, bilimin insan yaşamı üzerindeki pratik etkilerine odaklanır ve teorik bilginin ötesinde, bilginin pratik kullanımını vurgular. # Kültür Kültür alanında pragmatizm, değişen toplumsal değerlere ve ihtiyaçlara uyum sağlama ve sürekli yenilenme önemini vurgular. Kültürel ürünlerin ve pratiklerin, toplumun değişen koşullarına nasıl yanıt verdiği ve bireylerin yaşamlarını nasıl zenginleştirdiği ile ilgilenir. Pragmatizm bu çerçevede, katı kültürel normlar ve gelenekler yerine, daha esnek ve evrimsel bir kültürel anlayışı destekler. Sonuç olarak, pragmatizm dini ya da din dışı her türlü metafizik ve ideolojik önkabulden kuşku duyar ve değişen koşulları dikkate alarak sürekli bir yenilenmeyi, adaptasyonu ve evrimi ilke edinir. Bu felsefe, \\"dün dündür, bugün bugündür\\" ifadesiyle özetlenebilecek gerçekçi bir dünya görüşünü teşvik eder ve ekonomi, siyaset, bilim ve kültür gibi çeşitli alanlarda sonuç odaklı yansımaları savunur."},{"prompt":"我们可以提前联系客户，了解是否需要停车位，并想办法安排新的停车位。我们将指派专人负责房间分配和入住事宜。 推算结果用俄语写出来，要求书面形式。","completion":"Мы можем заранее связаться с клиентом, чтобы узнать, нужно ли ему место для парковки, и постараемся организовать новое место для парковки.

Pragmatizm, 19. yüzyılın sonlarında Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'nde ortaya çıkan ve özellikle William James, Charles Sanders Peirce ve John Dewey gibi düşünürler tarafından geliştirilen bir felsefi akımdır. Bu felsefe, doğruluk ve anlamın yararlılık ve pratik sonuçlarla belirlendiğini savunur. Yani bir teori, fikir veya inancın değeri, onun pratikteki uygulanabilirliği ve gerçekleştirdiği somut sonuçlar üzerinden ölçülür. Pragmatizm, dogmatik ön kabullerden ziyade deneyim ve deneysel doğrulamayı esas alır; böylece değişen koşullara uyum sağlamayı ve sürekli yenilenmeyi teşvik eder. Ekonomi Pragmatizm ekonomi alanında, sabit kurallar veya kesin öngörüler yerine, ekonomik koşulların değişkenliğine ve belirsizliğine vurgu yapar. Esnek politikalar ve uygulamalar gerektiğinde revize edilir ya da tamamen değiştirilir, bu sayede ekonomi daha dinamik ve adaptif hale gelir. Pragmatist ekonomi politikaları, temelde deneme yanılma ve geribildirim mekanizmalarına dayanır. Siyaset Pragmatizm, siyasetin dogmatik ideolojiler yerine çözüm odaklı olması gerektiğini savunur. Politik kararlar, belirli bir ideolojiye bağlı kalmaktansa, somut sorunları çözme temelinde alınır. Bu yaklaşım, uzlaşıyı ve çok çeşitli perspektiflerin değerlendirilmesini teşvik eder, siyasi kutuplaşmayı azaltabilir ve daha işlevsel, halkın ihtiyaçlarına duyarlı bir yönetim anlayışına yol açabilir. Bilim Pragmatizm, bilimin de kesin, değişmez doğrular yerine, sürekli gelişim ve yenilik arayışı içinde olması gerektiğini vurgular. Bilimsel teorilerin ve yöntemlerin, gerçek dünyadaki sorunları çözmek ve anlamak için en yararlı araçlar olarak değerlendirildiği ve değişen koşullara ve yeni bilgilere göre adapte edilebildiği bir anlayıştır. Bu, bilimsel gelişimin doğası gereği iteratif ve dinamik olması gerektiğini ifade eder. Kültür Kültür alanında, pragmatizm esnekliği ve sürekli yenilenmeyi destekler. Farklı kültürel ifadeler ve pratikler, sürekli olarak değerlendirilir ve toplumların ihtiyaçlarına cevap verebilecek şekilde evrimleşir. Bu, kültürel çeşitliliği ve yaratıcılığı teşvik ederken, aynı zamanda toplumların değişen koşullara ve dünya görüşlerine uyum sağlama kapasitesini geliştirir. Genel olarak, pragmatizm, bireylerin ve toplumların, değişen koşullara esnek ve uyumlu bir şekilde yanıt verme kabiliyetini vurgulayan, uygulamalı ve sonuç odaklı bir felsefedir. Bu, farklı alanlardaki uygulamalara somut ve pragmatik yaklaşımlarla, dogmatik sınırlamalardan uzak, yenilikçi ve adaptif çözümler bulunmasını teşvik eder."},{"prompt":"Dini ya da din dışı her türden metafizik ya da ideolojik önkabule (tek tanrılı dinler, Marksizm vb.) karşı kuşkuculuğu esas alan ve değişen somut koşulları analiz ederek sürekli bir yenilenmeyi, adaptasyonu, evrimi ilke edinen, “dün dündür, bugün bugündür.” ifadesiyle özetleyeceğimiz esnekliğe sahip gerçekçi dünya görüşü hangi felsefe ile uyumludur ve bu düşüncenin ekonomi, siyaset, bilim, kültür alanlarındaki yansımaları nelerdir?","completion":"Tanımladığınız dünya görüşü, temelde pragmatizm ile uyumlu görünmektedir.

Pragmatizm, metafizik ya da ideolojik öncüllere kuşkuyla yaklaşır ve bilgiyi, belirli bir bağlam ve amaca hizmet eden, somut sonuçlara odaklanan bir araç olarak görür. Bu düşünce sistemi, değişken gerçeklik karşısında esnek bir yaklaşımı ve adaptasyonu ön planda tutar. Ekonomi, siyaset, bilim ve kültür alanlarındaki yansımaları ise şöyle sıralanabilir: 1. **Ekonomi:** Pragmatist bir yaklaşım, ekonomik teorilerin ve politikaların realiteye nasıl uygulandığına odaklanır. Ekonomik modellerin teorik doğruluğundan ziyade, gerçekte nasıl işlediği ve sonuçları üzerinde durulur. Esnek piyasa mekanizmaları, yenilik ve adaptasyon bu bakış açısında kritik önem taşır. 2. **Siyaset:** Pragmatizm, siyasi ideolojilerin ve politikaların pratik sonuçlarına odaklanır. Dogmatik ideolojilere karşı çıkarken, çözüm üretme ve problem çözme süreçlerinde pragmatik ve esnek olmayı savunur. Siyasi kararlar, somut durumlar ve ihtiyaçlar doğrultusunda, deneme yanılma yoluyla şekillendirilir. 3. **Bilim:** Bilimde pragmatizm, teorilerin ve hipotezlerin gözlemlenebilir sonuçları ve uygulamaları üzerinden değerlendirilmesini önerir. Bilimsel bilgi sürekli bir gelişim içinde olduğundan, pragmatist yaklaşım, gerçeğin kesin ve değişmez bir noktaya ulaşamayacağını, bunun yerine bilginin işlevselliği ve uygulanabilirliğinin önemli olduğunu vurgular. 4. **Kültür:** Pragmatizm, kültür ve toplumsal normların değişen koşullara nasıl adaptasyon gösterdiğini inceler. Kültürel değerlerin ve inanç sistemlerinin toplumsal işlevlerine ve bunların bireylerin deneyimleri üzerindeki pratik etkilerine odaklanır. Burada önemli olan, belirli bir kültürel öğenin bireylerin ve toplumların ihtiyaçlarını nasıl karşıladığıdır. Pragmatizm bu şekilde, felsefe, ekonomi, siyaset, bilim ve kültürde esneklik, adaptasyon ve pratik sonuçlara odaklanan bir dünya görüşü olarak kendini gösterir.

К сожалению непосредственно на ProxMox интернета нет, но есть но ноутбуке. Мне нужно установить и настроить samba и webmin, могу ли я как то скачать пакеты на ноутбук и потом локально установить их на поднятой ВМ?","completion":"Да, вы можете скачать пакеты на свой ноутбук, а затем перенести их на вашу виртуальную машину (ВМ) с CentOS 8 на ProxMox для локальной установки. Вот как вы можете это сделать: # Шаг 1: Скачивание пакетов Для начала вам потребуется скачать пакеты \`samba\` и \`webmin\` вместе с их зависимостями на ваш ноутбук. Это можно сделать с помощью команды \`yum\` или \`dnf\` с опцией \`download-only\` на другом компьютере с CentOS или с помощью прямого скачивания пакетов из репозиториев через веб-браузер. Так как ваш ноутбук может иметь другую операционную систему, возможно, вам придется скачивать пакеты напрямую из репозиториев CentOS или с использованием контейнера Docker с CentOS для имитации системы на CentOS и использования команды \`dnf\`. 1. **Через Docker** (опционально, если у вас не CentOS на ноутбуке): \`\`\`bash docker run -it --name centos-download --rm centos:8 /bin/bash dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core dnf download samba webmin --resolve \`\`\` После скачивания пакеты окажутся в рабочей директории контейнера Docker. Используйте \`docker cp\` для извлечения файлов из контейнера. 2. **Прямое скачивание**: Или вы можете попытаться найти и скачать пакеты вместе с их зависимостями напрямую с официальных сайтов или репозиториев CentOS. Это может быть непросто, поскольку вам нужно будет вручную решить все зависимости. # Шаг 2: Перенос пакетов на ВМ Перенесите скачанные пакеты на ВМ, используя SCP (Secure Copy) или другие средства переноса файлов. Если ваш ProxMox и ВМ настроены на общую сеть с вашим ноутбуком или могут достучаться друг до друга через сеть, использование SCP будет самым простым решением. Вы можете использовать команду вроде этой на вашем ноутбуке: \`\`\`bash scp /path/to/packages username@your_vm_ip:/path/to/destination \`\`\` \`/path/to/packages\` замените на путь к пакетам на вашем ноутбуке, \`username\` на вашего пользователя на ВМ, \`your_vm_ip\` на IP-адрес вашей ВМ, \`/path/to/destination\` на путь, куда хотите скопировать пакеты на ВМ. # Шаг 3: Локальная установка пакетов После того, как вы перенесли пакеты на ВМ, можно приступить к их установке. Войдите на вашу ВМ и выполните следующие команды для установки этих пакетов при помощи \`dnf\` или \`yum\`: \`\`\`bash cd /path/to/destination sudo dnf install *.rpm \`\`\` Замените \`/path/to/destination\` на путь, куда вы скопировали пакеты. # Заключение Теперь \`samba\` и \`webmin\` должны быть установлены на вашей ВМ. Обратите внимание, что установка программного обеспечения этим способом требует внимательной проверки зависимостей, и вам может потребоваться несколько попыток, чтобы убедиться, что все необходимые зависимости установлены."},{"prompt":"Так же на старом ProxMox были резервные копии одной ВМ.

Процесс включает в себя копирование файлов резервной копии на новый сервер ProxMox, а затем восстановление ВМ из этих файлов. # Шаг 1: Копирование файлов резервной копии на сервер ProxMox Обычно в резервной копии ProxMox находятся файлы с расширением \`.vma.lzo\` или \`.vma.gz\` для сжатых копий и \`.log\` для логов. В последних версиях ProxMox используется формат \`.vma.lzo\` или \`.vma.gz\` для сжатия архивов. Поскольку в веб-интерфейсе нет возможности напрямую загрузить резервные копии, используйте SCP или другие средства для копирования файла резервной копии (например, \`vzdump-qemu-100-2023_03_30-12_05_03.vma.lzo\`) на сервер ProxMox. Вы должны скопировать файл в соответствующую директорию хранения резервных копий, которая обычно находится в \`/var/lib/vz/dump/\` на сервере ProxMox. \`\`\`bash scp path/to/your/backup/file.vma.lzo root@your_proxmox_server:/var/lib/vz/dump/ \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Восстановление ВМ из резервной копии После копирования файлов резервной копии на сервер, вы можете восстановить ВМ, используя командную строку ProxMox. 1. Войдите на сервер ProxMox через SSH или используйте консоль Proxmox. 2. Используйте команду \`qmrestore\` для восстановления ВМ. Например: \`\`\`bash qmrestore /var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-qemu-100-2023_03_30-12_05_03.vma.lzo 100 \`\`\` В этой команде: - \`/var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-qemu-100-2023_03_30-12_05_03.vma.lzo\` является путём к файлу резервной копии. - \`100\` является идентификатором ВМ (VMID), куда вы хотите восстановить копию. Убедитесь, что это VMID не используется другой ВМ. Если VMID уже занят или вы хотите восстановить ВМ под другим номером, просто укажите другой VMID в команде. После успешного выполнения команды ваша ВМ будет восстановлена и появится в списке ВМ в веб интерфейсе ProxMox. Вы сможете запустить и использовать её как обычно. # Заключение Таким образом, процесс восстановления виртуальной машины на сервере ProxMox потребует от вас использования SCP для загрузки файлов резервной копии на сервер и использования команды \`qmrestore\` для фактического восстановления ВМ.

У меня Proxmox и мне нужно дать оперативную память и процессор","completion":"Системные требования для сервера Samba и Webmin значительно зависят от объема задач, которые вы планируете на них возложить, таких как количество одновременных подключений, размер обрабатываемых файлов, и другие параметры использования. Однако можно предоставить общие рекомендации для минимальной установки. # Samba **Минимальные требования (для небольших или тестовых сред):** - **Процессор:** 1 ядро (современный процессор с низкой производительностью будет достаточен) - **Оперативная память:** от 512 МБ до 1 ГБ **Рекомендуемые требования (для производственного использования в небольших организациях):** - **Процессор:** 2 ядра или более - **Оперативная память:** от 2 ГБ и выше Для крупных развертываний с высоким уровнем потребления и большим количеством одновременных подключений, требования могут быть значительно выше. Опять же, точные требования будут зависеть от вашей конкретной ситуации. # Webmin Webmin — относительно легковесное приложение для администрирования системы через веб-интерфейс. **Минимальные требования:** - **Процессор:** 1 ядро - **Оперативная память:** от 512 МБ (с Webmin работа будет достаточно комфортной для базовых задач) **Рекомендуемые требования:** - **Процессор:** 1 ядро или более - **Оперативная память:** 1 ГБ или более Эти требования, как правило, являются достаточными для некритичных рабочих нагрузок и управления небольшим числом сервисов через Webmin. # Общие соображения - **Диск:** Производительность и объем дискового пространства, требуемые вашим сервером Samba, могут значительно варьироваться в зависимости от размера и количества файлов, с которыми вам предстоит работать. Стандартным выбором для большинства применений станет SSD для увеличения скорости доступа к данным. - **Сеть:** Пропускная способность и латентность сети также играют важную роль, особенно для Samba, так как это напрямую влияет на скорость доступа пользователей к ресурсам. Имейте в виду, что виртуальная машина в Proxmox также будет потреблять немного системных ресурсов сверх того, что выделено собственно приложениям. Поэтому рекомендуется придерживаться скорее верхней границы минимально-рекомендованных требований или превышать ее, если это позволяют ресурсы вашего физического сервера."},{"prompt":"Сколько сокетов и ядер нужно на 5 пользователей","completion":"При определении количества сокетов и ядер процессора для сервера, обслуживающего 5 пользователей, важно учитывать тип и объем работы, которую будет выполнять ваш сервер. В вашем случае, если речь идет о сервере Samba и Webmin, требования довольно скромные для поддержки такого небольшого числа активных пользователей. # Сервер Samba для 5 пользователей: **Основная задача сервера**: Предоставление файловых ресурсов в небольшой офисной среде или группе. - **Процессор**: Для небольшого числа пользователей (5) одноядерный процессор будет абсолютно достаточен. Однако, если у вас есть возможность выделить 2 ядра, это обеспечит немного больше гибкости для обработки возможных пиковых нагрузок при доступе к файлам или выполнении других задач. - **Сокеты**: Не имеет особого значения в контексте виртуализации для такого малого количества пользователей. Наибольшее значение имеют общее доступное количество ядер и процессорные ресурсы. # Сервер Webmin: **Основная задача сервера**: Управление системой и сервисами через веб-интерфейс. - **Процессор**: Webmin еще менее требователен к процессорным ресурсам при небольшом количестве одновременных сеансов. Одно ядро будет более чем достаточно для удовлетворения потребностей управления системой для 5 пользователей. Если вы планируете использовать один виртуальный сервер для обоих сервисов, 2 ядра будут оптимальным выбором для обеспечения плавной работы при совместном использовании. # Общие соображения: - **Оперативная память**: Для комфортной работы Samba и Webmin для 5 пользователей рекомендуется начинать с минимум 2 ГБ RAM. Это обеспечит достаточный запас для операционной системы и обеих приложений. - **Сетевые ресурсы**: Убедитесь, что ваша сетевая инфраструктура достаточно производительна для поддержки пиковых нагрузок, особенно если сервер Samba используется для интенсивного обмена файлами. - **Хранилище**: SSD предпочтительнее для системы и данных для обеспечения быстрого доступа и производительности. Эти рекомендации являются отправной точкой. Точные требования могут меняться в зависимости от специфических условий использования, таких как размер и тип файлов, хранимых на сервере Samba, или количество и частота изменений в конфигурации через Webmin. Наблюдение за производительностью и мониторинг нагрузки в рабочем режиме позволят вам корректировать выделение ресурсов более точно."},{"prompt":"Translate Sinon je peux pas expliquer l'impulsion qui mène quelqu'un à baptiser sa boîte de surveillance d'après un artefact magique qui corrompt et finit par tuer son utilisateur","completion":"Otherwise, I can't explain the impulse that leads someone to name their surveillance device after a magical artifact that corrupts and ultimately kills its user."},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Why do insurance companies pay for damaged infrastructure instead of tax payers?","completion":"Insurance companies step in to cover the costs of damaged infrastructure under policies purchased by owners or operators, essentially serving as a financial safety net.

He is best known for his significant contributions to poetry and literary criticism, as well as for his role in shaping the modernist movement in literature. Pound was a driving force behind Imagism, a movement that advocated for clear, precise imagery and free verse in poetry. His most ambitious work is the \\"Cantos,\\" an epic poem that remained unfinished at the time of his death, comprising 120 sections and illustrating his complex ideas about history, economics, and culture. Apart from his literary achievements, Pound's life was marked by controversy, particularly because of his support for Fascism during World War II and his broadcasts of fascist propaganda in Italy, which led to his arrest by American forces in 1945. After the war, he was detained in a psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over a decade, avoiding a trial for treason. Despite these controversies, Pound's influence on the development of modernist literature and his mentorship of other writers, including James Joyce, T.S.

Does she actually violate good singing technique rules or is it just the harmony im not used to?","completion":"When listening to \\"Obsesión\\" by Aventura, it's important to remember that musical appreciation often involves personal taste, cultural background, and familiarity with genres. The song, which is a mix of bachata and reggaeton, features a distinctive vocal style that may not be familiar to everyone. The female voice in the song, which serves as a counterpoint to the lead male vocals, may sound unusual to some listeners for several reasons: 1. **Stylistic Choices:** The singing style in \\"Obsesión\\" is influenced by bachata and urban genres. These music genres often incorporate vocal techniques and expressive choices that might differ significantly from classical or mainstream pop singing techniques. For example, vocal fry, intentional nasality, or a more spoken-word delivery can be stylistically appropriate here, even though such techniques might be considered unconventional or less desirable in other contexts. 2. **Harmony and Melody:** The harmonic progression and melodic lines in \\"Obsesión\\" are rooted in bachata and Latin pop traditions, which can include intervals, progressions, and resolutions that are different from those commonly found in other popular Western music genres. If you're not accustomed to these musical structures, they might sound unexpected or even jarring on first listen. 3. **Production Choices:** The mix and production of the song aim to create a particular aesthetic and ambiance that complement its lyrical theme and musical style. This can involve choices about vocal reverb, mixing the voice more prominently or more in the background, and balancing the vocal tracks with instrumentation, which can all affect how the vocals are perceived. Without a specific reference to a technical violation of singing technique, it's difficult to say definitively whether the performance adheres to classical standards of \\"good singing.\\" However, it's worth noting that adherence to such standards isn't necessarily the goal in many music genres, including bachata and reggaeton. Expression, emotion, and authenticity often take precedence over technical perfection. Ultimately, if the female vocals in \\"Obsesión\\" sound \\"wrong\\" to your ears, it might indeed be more about the harmony, production, or stylistic delivery being different from what you're accustomed to, rather than an issue of poor technique. Exposure to a wider variety of music styles can help acclimate your ear to unfamiliar genres, potentially leading to a greater appreciation of diverse singing styles."},{"prompt":"It’s the hook that sounds wrong to me. “No, no es amor…”. The way she goes down in the “amor”. Is that way of singung unconventional in that very specific case?","completion":"If the specific part you're referring to is the descending melody on the word \\"amor\\" in the hook \\"No, no es amor…\\" from \\"Obsesión\\" by Aventura, it's interesting to look at what might make it sound unusual or \\"wrong\\" to your ears. This part of the song is indeed where the female vocal takes a prominent role, and the way she sings may stand out for a few reasons: 1. **Melodic Contour:** The melody on \\"amor\\" takes a noticeable dip. This descending motion is musically expressive and likely chosen for its emotional effect. Descending melodies can evoke a sense of melancholy, resolution, or relaxation, depending on the context. In a song about obsession and unrequited love, such melodic choices can underscore the longing or despair in the lyrics. 2. **Vocal Technique:** The technique used to navigate the descending notes may contribute to the uniqueness of the sound. Depending on the singer's approach—such as the use of vibrato, changes in volume, or even a slide between notes (portamento)—the execution can affect how \\"conventional\\" it sounds to listeners. Techniques that are expressive in one genre may be less common or even discouraged in others. 3. **Intonation and Expression:** The way the notes are hit during the descent could also be a point of interest. In expressive singing, especially in genres that prioritize emotional conveyance over technical precision, singers might play with intonation slightly for effect. This can include bending pitches or using a more relaxed approach to pitch accuracy. To ears trained in genres that value strict intonation, this can initially sound \\"off.\\" 4. **Cultural and Genre Expectations:** Lastly, it's important to consider the musical context. Bachata and reggaeton, like many music genres, have their own sets of norms and expectations regarding vocal delivery. Listeners who are less familiar with these styles might find certain expressive techniques unconventional or unexpected. Given these points, the female vocal part in \\"Obsesión,\\" particularly at the moment you described, may indeed employ a combination of melodic, technical, and expressive choices that together create a sound that's unconventional to some listeners' ears. These choices, however, are likely intentional, serving the song's emotional and stylistic demands rather than adhering strictly to conventional singing rules. This instance demonstrates how diverse the concept of \\"good singing\\" can be across different musical contexts."},{"prompt":"你作为报关员，做出口数据提取。如下是出口装箱单内容，请你在表体中提取如下内容：始发国、目的国、发票号、唛头、海关商品编码、运输方式、发货公司名称、收货公司的名称、合同号、商品名称、总包装件数、总件数、总净重、总毛重、总体积。 在商品列表中，提取如下：装箱序号、商品数量、商品描述、净重、毛重、包装尺寸、商品体积、商品加包装的体积；并以列表形式输出。 例如： Case No. Quantity Description Weight(kgs) Measurement CUB.

Someone I've already loved will you find your way out of the blue? … Will it be my flat or your apartment When I finally realize I do? Will we meet on Baker Street Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue? … I don't know who you are But I'll save you a seat Hang my coat on a chair next to me I tried to reassure the waiter Say you're down the street He laughed at me So here's to you The most beautiful thing that I have never seen … Someone on a screen asked me a question Something about what love means to me Maybe it's just circumstance Or general compatibility … I don't know who you are But I'll save you a seat Hang my coat on a chair next to me I tried to reassure the waiter Say you're down the street He laughed at me So here's to you The most beautiful thing that I have never seen","completion":"The lyrics you've shared delve into the theme of anticipation and the unknown in the context of love and connection. Specifically, they explore the longing and hopeful expectation for a future romantic partner—one the speaker has not yet met but feels a deep connection to. This future-centric romanticism is rich with imagery that contrasts American and British elements (pavement/sidewalk, flat/apartment, Baker Street/Melrose Avenue) to emphasize the universal nature of such anticipations, irrelevant of the geographical or cultural differences. The repeated act of saving a seat and hanging a coat on a chair beside the narrator, even trying to convince a waiter of this unseen companion's imminent arrival, illustrates a poignant mix of hope and the somewhat humorous pathos of waiting for someone whose face or name the speaker does not yet know. This gesture symbolizes making space in one's life for a significant other, holding onto the belief in their eventual appearance despite external skepticism (represented by the waiter's laughter). The question about what love means to the narrator, prompted by \\"someone on a screen,\\" could signify the modern dilemma of defining authentic connections in a world where digital interfaces often mediate interpersonal interactions. The mention of \\"circumstance\\" and \\"general compatibility\\" might hint at how the narrator ponders the nature of love—is it fate, coincidence, shared interests, or something else entirely? Ultimately, the lyrics present a toast \\"to the most beautiful thing that I have never seen,\\" calling attention to the idealized form of love and the beloved in the narrator's mind. This idealization captures the essence of human longing and the beauty found in the hope for a deep, meaningful connection with another soul, even in the absence of their physical presence. The song, thus, speaks to a universal human experience—the search for love and the hope against odds that it will find a way into our lives."},{"prompt":"its a song by bruno mars titles THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING","completion":"Given the provided lyrics, it's clear that the song by Bruno Mars entitled \\"The Most Beautiful Thing\\" explores themes of longing, anticipation, and the idealized concept of love and connection. However, as of my last update, there hasn't been a song released by Bruno Mars officially under that title, which could mean the lyrics stem from a lesser-known or unreleased track, or there might be a mix-up with the title or artist. If these lyrics indeed pertain to a specific, perhaps newer or less-known work of Bruno Mars that was released or emerged online after my last update, my analysis based on the provided text still stands. The essence captured within these lyrics — the anticipation of love, the act of making room in one's life for a yet-to-be-met significant other, and reflecting on the nebulous concept of love — aligns with themes often found in Bruno Mars' music. His work frequently revolves around romantic themes, characterized by vivid storytelling and emotional honesty. Whether discussing desire and love in its many forms or dealing with the nuances of relationships and personal growth, Mars has a knack for creating deeply resonant music. Therefore, even without specific knowledge of this song, it's clear that these lyrics follow in the rich tradition of pop and R&B of contemplating love's complexities, beauties, and uncertainties. Making space for and toasting to \\"the most beautiful thing that I have never seen\\" speaks to an optimistic, undeterred belief in finding love, an idealized vision of romance that resonates widely with listeners who share similar hopes and daydreams about future connections."},{"prompt":"criar promtp pra criação de uma copy Milionária que vende qualquer coisa","completion":"Para criar uma \\"copy\\" milionária que tem o potencial de vender qualquer coisa, precisaremos nos concentrar em certos elementos essenciais que impulsionam as vendas e engajam os consumidores a tomar ações.

Números e Operações Básicas **Números:** Existem diferentes tipos de números: naturais (0, 1, 2, 3...), inteiros (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...), racionais (que podem ser expressos como a fração de dois inteiros, por exemplo, 1/2, 0.75) e reais (que incluem todos os números que podemos encontrar na linha numérica, inclusive irracionais como √2 e π). **Operações Básicas:** Adição, subtração, multiplicação e divisão. Essas operações formam a base para quase todos os conceitos matemáticos que você encontrará. - **Adição (+):** Combinação de dois ou mais números para formar uma soma. Por exemplo, 3 + 2 = 5. - **Subtração (-):** A operação de remover um número de outro. Por exemplo, 5 - 2 = 3. - **Multiplicação (×):** Adição repetida de um número. Por exemplo, 3 × 2 é o mesmo que adicionar 3 duas vezes, ou seja, 3 + 3 = 6. - **Divisão (÷):** A operação de distribuir um número igualmente. Por exemplo, 6 ÷ 2 = 3, porque 6 pode ser dividido em duas partes iguais de 3. # 2. Frações Uma fração representa uma parte de um todo e é composta por um numerador (parte superior) e um denominador (parte inferior). Por exemplo, na fração 1/2, 1 é o numerador e 2 é o denominador, significando que temos uma parte de um total divido em 2. **Operações com Frações:** - **Adição/Subtração:** Para somar ou subtrair frações com o mesmo denominador, você soma ou subtrai os numeradores. Para frações com denominadores diferentes, primeiramente você precisa encontrar um denominador comum. - **Multiplicação:** Multiplica-se os numeradores entre si e os denominadores entre si. Por exemplo, 1/2 × 1/3 = 1/6. - **Divisão:** Inverter a segunda fração (o divisor) e multiplicar. Por exemplo, 1/2 ÷ 1/3 é o mesmo que 1/2 × 3/1 = 3/2. # 3. Decimais e Percentuais **Decimais:** São outra maneira de representar frações e números racionais. Por exemplo, 0.5 é o mesmo que 1/2. **Percentuais:** Basicamente, um percentual é uma fração de 100. Por exemplo, 50% é o mesmo que 50/100 ou 0.5. # 4. Geometria Básica **Formas e Figuras:** A geometria lida com diferentes formas e figuras, como triângulos, quadrados, círculos. Cada figura tem suas próprias propriedades, como área e perímetro. - **Área:** Refere-se à quantidade de espaço dentro de uma figura.

Это – теплоэлектростанции, гидроэлектростанции, атомные электростанции и ископаемое топливо. В основном для получения энергии используют ископаемое топливо. На долю нефти приходится 31 % , уголь – 29 %, газ - 22 % использования. Остальные источники энергии используются в следующем соотношении: биотопливо - 10%, атомная энергетика – 5%, гидроэнергетика – 2% и прочие возобновляемые источники энергии – 1% (слайд 3). Ухудшение экологии и истощение природных ресурсов заставляет задумываться о том, как получать электричество и тепло из возобновляемых источников. 1. Экологические проблемы теплоэлектростанций (ТЭС) ТЭС – это предприятия, вырабатывающие электроэнергию на базе химического топлива (уголь, нефть, природный газ). В РФ на ТЭС вырабатывается около 70% энергии страны. На производство электроэнергии в РФ расходуется менее четверти горючих ископаемых, остальное – на получение тепла. При выработке электроэнергии выделяется значительное количество теплоты, поэтому электростанции строят вблизи городов и предприятий, используя их в качестве производителя тепловой энергии (теплоэлектроцентраль – ТЭЦ), повышая этим их мощность на треть. На современных ТЭЦ КПД достигает 40 – 60%, дальнейшее увеличение практически невозможно. Средняя ТЭЦ потребляет в год около 8 млн. т угля. Перевозка топлива для ТЭЦ составляет 40% грузовых перевозок страны. При сжигании угля в атмосферу от одной только крупной ТЭЦ ежегодно попадает 10 млн. т углекислого газа, что способствует “парниковому эффекту”, 400 тыс. т золы, 300 тыс. т окислов серы, около 100 тыс. т окислов азота, в результате чего появляются кислотные дожди. При сжигании угля в воздух попадают соединения тяжелых металлов, радиоактивные вещества, которых от ТЭЦ в атмосферу попадает в 2 раза больше, чем от АЭС. Загрязнения от ТЭЦ ощущаются в радиусе до 20 км. Кроме того, загрязнением является нагрев воды при охлаждении агрегатов, а также шлаки (2 – 10 млн. т), которые вывозят в золоотвалы, занимающие площадь для одной ТЭЦ 2 – 5 км² и расположенные в 15 – 20 км от города. ТЭЦ, работающие на нефти или газе, гораздо экологичнее угольных. 2. Экологические проблемы производства электроэнергии на АЭС Переход к атомной энергетике позволяет значительно снизить выбросы в атмосферу. На АЭС выбросы газов и жидкостей ниже допустимых пределов, годовой запас топлива порядка 10 куб. м, выбросы радиоактивных веществ меньше, чем от ТЭЦ. Экологическое воздействие АЭС – в тепловом загрязнении воды. Например, АЭС в Сосновом бору (Петербург) потребляет при охлаждении около 1 млн. куб. м морской воды в час. Особая проблема - радиоактивные отходы, которые после переработки имеют форму остеклованной массы 3 – 8 куб. м. Захоронение их происходит под строгим контролем. Кроме того, возможны аварии, приводящие к экологическим катастрофам. 3. Экологические проблемы гидроэлектростанций ГЭС традиционно считались сравнительно дешевым и чистым источником энергии. Сооружение плотин неизбежно связано с образованием крупных искусственных водоемов. Площадь Братского водохранилища соизмерима с Телецким озером Горного Алтая. Земля под водохранилищем потеряна безвозвратно. Это млн. га пашни, лесов, лугов, дорог, селений. А эти искусственные озера постепенно, но неизбежно мелеют, зацветают, заболачиваются, становятся причиной изменения климата в худшую сторону. У плотин ГЭС гибнет в огромных количествах животный и растительный мир рек. Количество рыбы, уничтожаемой на водозаборах ГЭС, многократно превышает то, что дают все рыбные предприятия страны. Только на водозаборах Астраханской области ежегодно гибнет более 15 млн. штук молоди рыб. В нижний бьеф вода попадает через турбины и по водоводам. На высотных плотинах (100 – 200 м) водоводы расположены на большой глубине (несколько десятков или более сотни метров), где вода летом и зимой имеет постоянную температуру. В условиях Сибири это приводит к тому, что летом в реке вода очень холодная - 6 -10 градусов при температуре на поверхности водохранилища 20 градусов. При коротком сибирском лете жители не имеют возможности искупаться в такой реке. Зимой река за плотиной не замерзает, так как через водовод попадает вода теплая – 4 градуса. Незамерзающий “язык” достигает 100 – 200 км, открытый водоем повышает влажность воздуха, при лютых сибирских морозах происходит кристаллизация льдинок в воздухе. Человек тяжело переносит сильные морозы с повышенной влажностью. Такая картина наблюдается в районе ГЭС бассейна Енисея: страдают больные астмой и другими заболеваниями дыхательного аппарата, повышается частота респираторных заболеваний. Такой “подарок” получили жители Красноярска, Братска и других сибирских городов. Изменился режим реки, не все породы рыбы выдержали глобальные изменения своей среды обитания. Построен ряд ГЭС и на равнинных реках, в частности Новосибирская ГЭС. Эта ГЭС не решает энергетической проблемы города, но громадное (протяженностью 200 км) водохранилище затопило плодородные земли в пойме реки, села и деревни. Идет постоянное обрушение берега из-за эрозии, водохранилище в основном мелкое и “зацветает”, постепенно заболачиваясь. Погибают некогда значительные запасы рыбы. Сибирские ученые, имея в виду проблемы и этого водохранилища, заявили: “Строительство гидроэлектростанций на равнинных реках – экологическое преступление”. Запасы ископаемого топлива сокращаются, атомная энергетика не всегда применяется, ГЭС не везде можно применять. Кроме того, выбросы от ТЭЦ создают колоссальные выбросы. В 2015 г. Мировое сообщество приняло соглашение о снижении «углеродного следа», поэтому, эффективно вместо ископаемого топлива применять альтернативные источники энергии и топлива. Поэтому мировое сообщество склоняется к использованию алтернативной энергетики. Будущее энергетики: новые тенденции развития. Перспективы трансформации нефтегазового сектора В обозримом будущем мировой спрос на доступные и надежные источники энергоресурсов будет по-прежнему расти, однако наметилась и новая тенденция более длительного характера на фоне осуществляемого во многих странах мира перехода на энергосистемы с низким содержанием углерода. В мировом энергобалансе преобладает ископаемое топливо. Если оценивать мировую энергетику в целом, можно сказать, что мир попрежнему очень сильно зависим от ископаемых источников энергии. По данным МЭА, на нефть, газ и уголь приходится около 80 % спроса на первичные энергоресурсы. Наша зависимость от энергоресурсов, в частности от нефти, еще более усиливается за счет неослабевающего спросом на нее со стороны транспортного сектора, потому что по-прежнему остается труднодостижимой коммерчески реализуемая альтернатива двигателю внутреннего сгорания, работающему на ископаемом топливе. На долю транспорта по-прежнему приходится более 60 % мирового спроса на нефтепродукты. Согласно текущим отраслевым прогнозам в отношении спроса на энергоносители предполагается, что в период с 2021 г. по 2040 г. наиболее высокие темпы роста будут характерны для возобновляемой и атомной энергетики. Однако, в 2040 году ископаемое топливо будет по-прежнему доминировать в структуре спроса на энергоносители: его доля будет составлять 75 % - 80 % . Четыре возможные перспективы развития сектора в будущем. 1.Нефтегазовый сектор развивается в русле тенденций, действующих в экономике в настоящее время. Сохранение волатильности цен препятствует инвестициям 2. Переход на более эффективные энергосистемы с низким содержанием углерода стимулируют потребители энергии (как в розничном, так и коммерческом секторе) 3. Действия правительства и (или) геополитические события приводят к ограничению предложения 4. Правительства стимулируют создание условий, способствующих расширению и ускорению темпов роста спроса на «чистую» энергию. Самый оптимальный вариант с точки зрения экологии – развитие альтернативной энергетики. Перспективы использования возобновляемых источников энергии связаны с их экологической чистотой, низкой стоимостью эксплуатации и ожидаемым топливным дефицитом в традиционной энергетике. Энергия бывает возобновляемой (альтернативной) и невозобновляемой (традиционной). Альтернативные источники энергии – это обычные природные явления, неисчерпаемые ресурсы, которые вырабатываются естественным образом. Такая энергия ещё называется регенеративной или «зелёной». Невозобновляемые источники – это нефть, природный газ и уголь. Им ищут замену, потому что они могут закончиться. Ещё их использование связано с выбросом углекислого газа, парниковым эффектом и глобальным потеплением. Альтернати́вная энерге́тика — перспективные способы получения, передачи и использования энергии, которые распространены не так широко, как традиционные, однако представляют интерес из-за выгодности их использования при, как правило, низком риске причинения вреда окружающей среде. Основным направлением альтернативной энергетики является поиск и использование альтернативных (нетрадиционных) источников энергии. Источники энергии — «встречающиеся в природе вещества и процессы, которые позволяют человеку получить необходимую для существования энергию». Альтернативный источник энергии является возобновляемым ресурсом, он заменяет собой традиционные источники энергии, функционирующие на нефти, газе и угле, которые при сгорании выделяют в атмосферу CO2 , который приводит к «парниковому эффекту». Альтернативные источники энергии должны быть экологичными. Отдельно следует упомянуть об альтернативном топливе – топливо, заменяющее нефть, газ, уголь, например, биогаз или водородное топливо. Классификация альтернативных источников № энергия Пример / способ использования 1. Солнечная энергия Солнечные батареи, солнечные электростанции 2. Ветровая энергия Ветряные электростанции, ветрогенераторы 3. Энергия геотермальных источников Турбины, вращаемые паром 4. Энергия приливов и отливов Гидроаккумулирущие электростанции, гидротурбины, гидроагрегаты 5. Энергия температурного градиента морской воды Гидроаккумулирущие электростанции, гидротурбины, гидроагрегаты 6. Водородная энергетика Водородные двигатели Топливные элементы 7. Альтернативное топливо Биогаз, биотопливо Солнечная энергетика — энергия, основанная на использовании солнечного излучения. Это возобновляемый и «экологически чистый» источник энергии. Производство энергии происходит с помощью солнечных электростанций, на которых используются солнечные батареи или солнечные коллекторы. Солнечная батарея — объединение фотоэлектрических преобразователей (фотоэлементов) — полупроводниковых устройств, прямо преобразующих солнечную энергию в постоянный электрический ток, в отличие от солнечных коллекторов, производящих нагрев материала-теплоносителя. Различные устройства, позволяющие преобразовывать солнечное излучение в тепловую и электрическую энергию, являются объектом исследования гелиоэнергетики (от гелиос греч. Ήλιος, Helios — «Солнце»). Производство фотоэлектрических элементов и солнечных коллекторов развивается в разных направлениях. Солнечные батареи бывают различного размера: от встраиваемых в микрокалькуляторы до занимающих крыши автомобилей и зданий. Гелиотермальная энергетика — нагревание поверхности, поглощающей солнечные лучи, и последующее распределение и использование тепла (фокусирование солнечного излучения на сосуде с водой или солью для последующего использования нагретой воды для отопления, горячего водоснабжения или в паровых электрогенераторах). В качестве особого вида станций гелиотермальной энергетики принято выделять солнечные системы концентрирующего типа (CSP — Concentrated solar power). В этих установках энергия солнечных лучей с помощью системы линз и зеркал фокусируется в концентрированный луч света. Этот луч используется как источник тепловой энергии для нагрева рабочей жидкости. В 2020 году общая установленная мощность всех работающих солнечных панелей на Земле составила 760 ГВт. 2019 году общая установленная мощность всех работающих солнечных панелей на Земле составила 635 ГВт. В 2019 году всего работающие солнечные панели на Земле произвели 2,7 % мировой электроэнергии. Один из самых мощных видов альтернативных источников энергии. Чаще всего её преобразуют в электричество солнечными батареями. Всей планете на целый год хватит энергии, которую солнце посылает на Землю за день. Впрочем, от общего объёма годовая выработка электроэнергии на солнечных электростанциях не превышает 2%. Основные недостатки – зависимость от погоды и времени суток. Для северных стран извлекать солнечную энергию невыгодно. Конструкции дорогие, за ними нужно «ухаживать» и вовремя утилизировать сами фотоэлементы, в которых содержатся ядовитые вещества (свинец, галлий, мышьяк). Для высокой выработки необходимы огромные площади. Солнечное электричество распространено там, где оно дешевле обычного: отдалённые обитаемые острова и фермерские участки, космические и морские станции. В тёплых странах с высокими тарифами на электроэнергию, оно может покрывать нужны обычного дома. Например, в Израиле 80% воды нагревается солнечной энергией. Батареи также устанавливают на беспилотные автомобили, самолёты, дирижабли. Ветроэнергетика — отрасль энергетики, специализирующаяся на преобразовании кинетической энергии воздушных масс в атмосфере в электрическую, механическую, тепловую или в любую другую форму энергии. Такое преобразование может осуществляться такими агрегатами, как ветрогенератор (для получения электрической энергии), ветряная мельница (для преобразования в механическую энергию), парус (для использования в транспорте). Энергия ветра – возобновляемый источник энергии. Крупные ветряные электростанции включаются в общую сеть, более мелкие используются для снабжения электричеством удалённых районов. В отличие от ископаемого топлива, энергия ветра практически неисчерпаема, повсеместно доступна и более экологична. Однако сооружение ветряных электростанций сопряжено с некоторыми трудностями технического и экономического характера, замедляющими распространение ветроэнергетики. В частности, непостоянство ветровых потоков не создаёт проблем при небольшой доле ветроэнергетики в общем производстве электроэнергии, однако при росте этой доли возрастают также и проблемы надёжности производства электроэнергии. В Республике Башкортостан действует ВЭС Тюпькильды мощностью 2,2 МВт, располагающаяся около одноимённой деревни Туймазинского района. ВЭС состоит из четырёх ветроагрегатов немецкой фирмы Hanseatische AG типа ЕТ 550/41 мощностью по 550 кВт. Годовая выработка электроэнергии в 2008—2010 годах не превышала 0,4 млн кВт*ч. Недостаток в том, что её нельзя контролировать (сила ветра непостоянна). Ещё ветроустановки могут вызывать радиопомехи и влиять на климат, потому что забирают часть кинетической энергии ветра – правда, учёные пока не знают хорошо это или плохо. Энергия приливов и отливов. Энергию, получаемая от естественного подъёма и спада уровня воды. Электростанции ставят только вдоль берега, а перепад воды должен быть не меньше 5 метров. Для генерации электричества строят приливные станции, дамбы и турбины. Приливы и отливы хорошо изучены, поэтому этот источник более предсказуем относительно других. Но освоение технологий было медленным и их доля в глобальном производстве мала. Кроме того, приливные циклы не всегда соответствуют норме потребления электричества. Энергия температурного градиента (гидротермальная энергия). Морская вода имеет неодинаковую температуру на поверхности и в глубине океана. Используя эту разницу, получают электроэнергию. Первая установка, которая даёт электричество за счёт температуры океана была сделана ещё в 1930 году. Сейчас есть океанические электростанции закрытого, открытого и комбинированного типа в США и Японии. Энергия жидкостной диффузии Это новый вид альтернативного источника энергии. Осмотическая электростанция, установленная в устье реки, контролирует смешение солёной и пресной воды и извлекает энергию из энтропии жидкостей. Выравнивание концентрации солей даёт избыточное давление, которое запускает вращение гидротурбины. Пока есть только одна такая энергетическая установка в Норвегии. Геотермальная энергия Геотермальные станции берут внутреннюю энергию Земли – горячую воду и пар. Их ставят в вулканических районах, где вода у поверхности или добраться до неё можно пробурив скважину (от 3 до 10 км.). Извлекаемая вода отапливает здания напрямую или через теплообменный блок. Ещё её перерабатывают в электричество, когда горячий пар вращает турбину, соединённую с электрогенератором. Недостатки: цена, угроза температуре Земли, выбросы углекислого газа и сероводорода. Больше всего геотермальных станций в США, Филиппинах, Индонезии, Мексике и Исландии. В России большое количество геотермальных источников на Камчатке. Биотопливо Биоэнергетика получает электричество и тепло из топлива первого, второго и третьего поколений. • Первое поколение – твёрдое, жидкое и газообразное биотопливо (газ от переработки отходов). Например, дрова, биодизель и метан. • Второе поколение – топливо, полученное из биомассы (остатков растительного или животного материала, или специально выращенных культур). • Третье поколение – биотопливо из водорослей. Биотопливо первого поколения легко получить. Сельские жители ставят биогазовые установки, где биомасса бродит под нужной температурой. Самый традиционный способ и древнейшее топливо – дрова. Сейчас для их производства сажают энергетические леса из быстрорастущих деревьев, тополя или эвкалипта. Водородная энергетика — отрасль энергетики, основанная на использовании водорода в качестве средства для зарядки, транспортировки, производства и потребления энергии. Водород выбран как наиболее распространенный элемент на поверхности земли и в космосе, теплота сгорания водорода наиболее большая, а продуктом сгорания в кислороде является вода (которая также вводится в оборот водородной энергетики). Водородная энергетика относится к альтернативной энергетике. Общемировая структура производства водорода распределена по трём основным источникам: 18% приходится на переработку угля, 4,3% обеспечивается за счёт «зелёного» водорода, получаемого посредством возобновляемых источников энергии (ВИЭ), главным образом при электролизе воды. Наконец, подавляющий объём — а это 78% — составляет переработка природного газа и нефти. На настоящий момент наиболее экономически выгодным считается производство водорода из ископаемого сырья. Снизить уровень выбросов углерода в производственных отраслях можно за счет водорода, полученного с использованием низкоуглеродных технологий, для этого можно применять технологии улавливания и хранения углекислого газа, а также электролиза воды, «в первую очередь с помощью энергии объектов атомной, гидро-, ветряной и солнечной энергетики». Цветовая градация водорода зависит от способа его выработки и углеродного следа, то есть количества вредных выбросов: • «зеленый» — произведён с помощью энергии из возобновляемых источников методом электролиза воды, считается самым чистым; • «голубой» — произведенный из природного газа; в этом случае углекислый газ накапливается в специальных хранилищах; • «розовый/красный/желтый» — произведенный при помощи атомной энергии. • при производстве «серого» водорода вредные выбросы идут в атмосферу. Себестоимость «зеленого» водорода около 10 долларов за кг (что «абсолютно нерентабельно», по мнению главы Фонда национальной энергетической безопасности); «голубой» и «желтый» водород в несколько раз дешевле «зеленого» — от 2 долларов за килограмм. В настоящее время существует множество методов промышленного производства H2: разрабатывались технологии производства водорода из мусора, этанола, металлургического шлака, биомассы и другие технологии. Альтернативная энергетика в мире Отказаться от использования угля для получения электроэнергии пообещали в ноябре 2017 года 20 стран с разных континентов. Однако самые активные потребители угля пока не стали присоединяться к альянсу. На конференции ООН по климатическим изменениям в Бонне (Германия) 20 государств присоединились к альянсу Powering Past Coal. Он выступает за прекращение использования угля в электроэнергетике. Реализовать этот план страны намерены до 2030 года, сообщает ABC News. К проекту присоединились такие европейские державы, как Дания, Италия, Финляндия, Франция, Португалия, Нидерланды, Великобритания, Люксембург, Австрия, Швейцария и Бельгия. Также отказаться от угля для выработки электроэнергии решили Канада, Новая Зеландия, Ниуэ, Эфиопия, Ангола, Мексика, Сальвадор, Фиджи и Маршалловы острова. Однако главными потребителями угля в мире остаются Китай, Индия, Россия, США и Германия, которые пока не стали вступать в союз. Альтернативная энергетика в России. Солнечная энергия Используется и в промышленных масштабах, и у местного населения как резервный или основной источник тепла и электричества. Мощность всех солнечных установок – 400 МВт, из них самые крупные в Самарской, Астраханской, Оренбургской областях и Крыму. Самая мощная СЭС – «Владиславовка» (Крым). Ещё разрабатываются проекты для Сибири и Дальнего Востока. Ветровая энергетика Ветровая возобновляемая энергия в России представлена чуть хуже, чем солнечная, хотя и здесь есть промышленные установки. Общая мощность ветровых генераторов в нашей стране – 183,9 МВт (0,08 % от всей энергосистемы). Больше всего установок – в Крыму, а мощнейшая находится в Адыгее – «Адыгейская ВЭС». Гидроэнергетика Это самый популярный вариант альтернативного источника энергии в России. Около 200 речных ГЭС вырабатывают до 20% от всей энергии в стране. В заливе Кислая губа в Мурманской области с 1968 года есть приливная электростанция – «Кислогубская ПЭС». Самая крупная ГЭС стоит на реке Енисей – «Саяно-Шушенская». Геотермальная энергетика За счёт обилия вулканов этот вид энергетики распространён на Камчатке. Там 40% потребляемой энергии генерируется на геотермальных источниках. По данным учёных, потенциал Камчатки оценивается в 5000 МВт, а вырабатывается только 80 МВт энергии в год. Ещё геотермальные станции есть на Курилах, Ставропольском и Краснодарском крае. Биотопливо Наша страна входит в тройку экспортёров пеллет на европейском рынке. В России есть заводы, создающие из остатков древесины пеллеты и брикеты, которыми топят котлы и печки.Сельскохозяйственные отходы преобразуют в жидкое топливо и биогаз для дизельных двигателей. А вот свалочный газ не используется вообще, его просто выбрасывают в атмосферу, нанося ущерб окружающей среде. 4. Экологические проблемы производства электроэнергии с использованием “нетрадиционных” источников энергии Существует ряд неисчерпаемых энергетических источников, но используются они в незначительных масштабах. Причина – отсутствие приемлемых решений для их реализации. Время их еще не пришло. Это солнечная энергия, тепловая энергия недр, энергия океанских приливов и волн, ветровая и альтернативное топливо. Суммарная мощность солнечной энергии колоссальна: за год на 1% площади пустыни Сахара падает количество солнечной энергии, которое превышает потребность в ней всего человечества. Но эта энергия непостоянна, зависит от погоды, времени года. В мире работают солнечные экспериментальные электростанции (СЭС, гелиоэлектростанции). Работают маяки и бакены на солнечной энергии. Наручные часы, калькуляторы давно работают на солнечной энергии, космические аппараты. Солнечная энергия завоевывает себе место под солнцем. Запасы термальных вод на Земле громадны, но при современном состоянии технологии можно использовать только воды в районах вулканической активности, на глубине 1 – 2 км. Тюменское “подземное море” по размерам превышает Черное, температура 60 – 300 градусов. Принцип работы: прием пароводяной смеси из скважин, отделение пара в турбины, а вода – отход производства. Но минерализованы эти моря до 30%, поэтому сточные воды загрязняют ядами окружающую среду. Притом откачка воды из недр может вызвать землетрясения. Сточную воду нужно закачивать назад, в “подземное море”, на что при современном уровне технологии уйдет вся добытая энергия. Геотермальные станции небольшой мощности (ГеоТЭС) работают в США, Японии, РФ. Энергия океанов и морей практически безгранична и вечна. Затраты на сооружение и работу приливных электростанций (ПЭС) определяются параметрами плотин. Энергия океанских волн огромна – волна высотой 3 м несет на 1 м берега энергию 90 кВт. 12 береговых энергетических установок в 50 миль могут полностью обеспечить Англию энергией. ПЭС оказывает минимальное влияние на среду. Однако удобных мест для строительства ПЭС мало. Экспериментальные ПЭС работают во многих странах. Энергия ветра непостоянна, использование ее затруднено. Целесообразно использовать ее для автономных потребителей наряду с другим видом энергии. Экологического ущерба нет, малые станции широко используют в разных странах. Количество объектов «зеленой» энергии за последние 20 лет утроилось и зачастую они превращаются в территории с интенсивным землепользованием и могут воздействовать на охраняемые близлежащие районы. Подобные сооружения чаще всего превосходят по площади те же электростанции, работающие на ископаемом топливе, и им требуются в десять раз большие территории, чтобы производить такое же количество энергии. По оценкам МЭА, для достижения нулевого суммарного выброса углекислого газа к 2050 г. с целью предотвращения потепления на Земле более чем на 1,5 градуса по Цельсию, две трети всей энергии и 90% электроэнергии на планете будет производить зелёная энергетика. К 2030 году развитие зеленой энергетики позволит создать 14 миллионов новых рабочих мест. Несмотря на пандемию, прирост возобновляемых источников энергии достиг 45% (280 гВт) в 2020 году, согласно новому отчету Международного энергетического агентства (МЭА). Это самый большой годовой прирост с 1999 года. В 2020 году возобновляемые источники энергии были «единственным источником энергии, спрос на который увеличился ... в то время как потребление всех других видов топлива снизилось», - заявляет МЭА. Среди лидеров по развитию возобновляемой энергетики Китай, на долю которого в течение нескольких лет приходилось около 40% мирового прироста мощностей в этой сфере. КНР также стала одним из крупнейших поставщиков сырья и материалов, необходимых для производства ветряных турбин и солнечных панелей, в том числе кремния, стекла, стали, меди, редкоземельных металлов. За четвертый квартал 2020 года на долю одного только Китая пришлось более 92 гВт мощностей, что в три раза превышает показатель за аналогичный период в 2019 году. США добавили за четвертый квартал 19 гВт, что значительно превышает показатель в 13,7 гВт за тот же период в 2019 году. “Нетрадиционные источники” - это энергия будущего, надежда цивилизации. Хотя эти электростанции не вредят окружающей среде, но для их строительства нужен металл, другие материалы, энергия, для получения которых используют экологически “грязные” технологии.

Под техносферой понимается часть естественной природной среды (биосферы), преобразованная человеком с помощью прямого или косвенного технического воздействия с целью удовлетворения своих материальных, социальных и культурных потребностей. Из этого определения следует, что техносфера — это не только сама техника, дороги, здания и сооружения, городская и промышленная застройка, но и всё, что было создано человеком при помощи техники или появилось вследствие использования техники — например, лесные вырубки, разрезы для добычи полезных ископаемых, отвалы пустой породы и многое, многое другое. Техносфера - глобальная совокупность орудий, объектов и продуктов человеческого производства. Создание техносферы – длительный процесс, который протекает в несколько этапов. Таблица 1. Этапы развития техносферы Начало этапа Переходный момент Содержание этапа 60 лет назад Научно- техническая революция Переход к использованию атомной энергии и других открытий и изобретений. Возникновение новой производительной силы — научно-технического знания. 160 лет назад Промышленная революция Переход к массовому промышленному производству предметов потребления. Возникновение мировой индустрии. 7 тыс. лет назад Урбанистическая революция Переход к строительству городов. Возникновение и развитие государств. 10 тыс. лет назад Биотехническая революция Переход к сельскому хозяйству. Возникновение техносферы. Возникновение техносферы связано с началом воздействия на природные объекты и процессы в период перехода человечества от охоты и собирательства к земледелию и скотоводству. Уменьшение влияния природных факторов на процесс получения пищи (биотехническая революция) позволило человечеству наращивать свою численность. Выделение ремесел как специализированных видов труда привело к развитию ремесленно-торговых центров - городов. Широкое вовлечение людей в мануфактурное производство приводит к переселению людей из сельской местности в города, к формированию новых социальных отношений и структур, нового образа жизни. Каждый последующий (новый) этап эволюции техносферы позволял добывать дополнительные материальные и энергетические ресурсы и тем самым поддерживал увеличение населения, удовлетворяя его растущие потребности. Например, появление новых источников энергии – энергии водяного пара, энергия сгорания жидкого топлива, электрическая энергия - позволили перейти от ручного труда к машинному производству, к увеличению видов транспортных средств (пароход, ж/д транспорт, прообразы автомобилей), развитию энергетики (ГЭС). Это, в свою очередь, привело к освоению новых территорий, увеличению добычи полезных ископаемых. Очередную, теперь уже свершившуюся, цивилизационную революцию можно назвать «информационной». Она началась менее 20 лет назад — в условиях этой революции мы сейчас и живём. Однако, эволюция техносферы с одной стороны, создает новые возможности для комфортной жизни миллионам людей во всем мире, но с другой - дополнительную антропогенную нагрузку на природную среду. Здесь важно остановиться на вопросе роста антропогенного воздействия на окружающую среду, вызванного эволюцией техносферы. В результате урбанистической революции возник новый вид техносферной территории — городская и жилая среда. Городская среда или урбанизированная среда – это часть глобальной среды обитания человечества и всех других живых организмов, ограниченная территорией, занятой городом, его пригородами и связанными с ними инженерными и транспортными сооружениями. Рассмотрим формирование городов и городской среды с учетом изменений их экологии и условий для жизнедеятельности людей. 2. Особенности экологии городской среды в историческом аспекте В результате урбанистической революции возник новый вид техносферной территории — городская и жилая среда. Процесс формирования городов можно условно подразделить на три стадии. На первой стадии урбанизации, которая длилась до XVI - XVII века основным источником экологических проблем являлась жизнедеятельность людей. Вторая стадия урбанизации совпала с развитием сухопутного и водного транспорта, дорог, открытием возможностей использования тепловой энергии для транспортных и производственных целей. Начало третьей стадии урбанизации относится к XIX веку и связывается с промышленной революцией, ознаменовавшейся резким увеличением воздействия на природную среду. Рассмотрим формирование городов и городской среды с учетом изменений их экологии и условий для жизнедеятельности людей. Города древнего мира и средневековья. Около 1,9 млн. лет назад люди стали строить первые жилища – хижины-шалаши, каркас которых составляли ветки и длинные кости убитых животных, накрытые настилом из травы и листьев. Основу существования человеческого общества в палеолите составляла охота на крупных животных и собирательство. Отходы жизнедеятельности первобытных охотников-собирателей быстро утилизировались природой. Деятельность древних охотников и собирателей сказывалась на флоре и фауне мест их обитания. Научные исследования палеонтологов свидетельствуют, что следствием расселения древнего человека на Земле можно считать исчезновение десятков видов в Европе и Америке. Первые поселения возникли на Земле, вероятно, 10—12 тысяч лет тому назад, когда земледелие стало превращаться в одно из важнейших занятий человека. Эти поселения насчитывали не более 100-150 человек и были достаточно отдалены друг от друга. В целом человек верхнего неолита в силу своей малочисленности (считают, что население Земли в то время не превышало 1-1,5 млн. чел.) и сравнительно невысокого удельного давления на природу хорошо \\"вписывался\\" в биотический круговорот. Повышение плотности населения привело к распространению различных инфекционных заболеваний. Экологические последствия древних поселений на природу: органическое истощение почв в результате выращивания сельскохозяйственных культур, вырубка лесов при заготовке древесины, перевыпас домашних животных, приводившие к эрозии почв. Города древнего мира. Первые города на нашей планете появились более 5000 лет назад. Это были небольшие компактные поселения людей, объединенных общими интересами: безопасность, возделывание земли, скотоводство. Население этих городов составляло несколько тысяч человек, а их небольшая территория была окружена пастбищами. Размеры этих поселений обычно лимитировались расстоянием, которое человек мог пройти пешком. Возникали древние города в основном в долинах и поймах рек, таких как, Нил, Тигр, Евфрат, Инд, Хуанхэ, наиболее благоприятных для земледелия и выпаса скота. Таблица 2 Численность населения крупнейших городов древнего мира Дата Год до н.э. 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 Городское население (тыс. чел.) 30 60 281 445 455 1904 2281 Самый крупный город (тыс. чел.)

Ктесифон (300) Константинополь (400) Чанган (420) Кордова (450) Ханчжоу (320) Пекин (900) Один из старейших и важнейших древних городов Египта, Мемфис в 3 тыс. до н.э насчитывал по разным оценкам от 20 до 80 тыс. человек. Жемчужина древних городов Месопотамии - Вавилон – 200 тыс. человек. Крупнейший мегаполис Александрия - 250 тыс. человек. Города средневековья. Средневековые города отличались крайне неблагоприятной для жизни здоровья обстановкой. Несовершенство системы вывода отходов производства и нечистот (иногда ее полное отсутствие), недостаток чистой питьевой воды, высокая плотность заселения (особенно в бедных кварталах) – все это способствовало развитию массовых эпидемий холеры, брюшного тифа, чумы и др. В эпоху средневековья стали появляться первые законодательные акты, направленные на охрану окружающей среды. Таблица 3 Антропогенное воздействие на окружающую среду в эпоху средневековья Время возникновения Основа существования человеческого общества ремесло, земледелие, животноводство Особенности ✓ город-крепость, окруженный мощными оборонительными сооружениями ✓ уступали по размерам поселениям древнего мира и редко насчитывали более нескольких десятков тысяч жителей ✓ высокая плотность заселения (особенно в бедных кварталах) ✓ несовершенство системы вывода отходов производства и нечистот (иногда ее полное отсутствие), ✓ недостаток чистой питьевой воды Воздействие на природу Вырубка лесов, расширение зон выпаса скота, отсутствие канализации, добыча полезных ископаемых (руд металлов) Начало промышленного воздействия на ОС – период с XVI по XVIII вв.— это время новых изобретений: водяной двигатель, доменная печь, развитие огнестрельного оружия, усовершенствование кораблей и техники мореплавания, переход на новые источники тепловой энергии: каменный угль и торф. Одновременно с этим появляются новые города, увеличивается численность их населения, начинается II этап урбанизации. Уровень воздействия промышленной составляющей города на природную среду в XVI – XVIII вв в основном не превышал пределов ее самоочищающейся способности. Первая промышленная революция - начало третей стадии урбанизации. Начало третьей стадии урбанизации относится к XIX веку и связывается с промышленной революцией, ознаменовавшейся резким увеличением воздействия на природную среду. Промышленная революция — процесс перехода от аграрной экономики, для которой характерен ручной труд и ремесленное производство, к индустриальному обществу с преобладанием машинного производства. Таблица 4 Антропогенное воздействие на окружающую среду (XIX век) Ключевой фактор: машины, работающие на водяном колесе или паровом двигателе; паровой двигатель создал возможности технологического роста единичной мощности предприятий; механизация производства оружия (высокоточные токарные станки); промышленное производство стали и стальных пушек (мартеновские печи). Колониальное подчинение новых территорий. Особенности рост числа городов, их укрупнение, а также повышение концентрации в них населения. Многие новые города образуются в это время вокруг промышленных предприятий, превращаясь впоследствии в крупные промышленные центры. Факторы влияния города на окружающую территорию: плотная промышленная застройку; высокая концентрация производства в столице; зарождение городских агломераций (Донбасс, Кузбасс); железнодорожное строительство и начало формирования промзон; угольная энергетика; текстильная промышленность, машиностроение, выплавка чугун. К 1900 г, первой урбанизированной страной в современном понимании стала Великобритания, а ко второй половине XX столетия практически все индустриальные страны превратились в урбанизированные. Особенности промышленного развития Российской империи. В.И. Бовыкин, обращаясь к вопросу о степени капиталистического развития России, характеризовал ее как полуиндустриальную державу с решающей ролью сельского хозяйства. В конце 90-х гг. XIX века значительная часть современных предприятий европейского уровня была сконцентрирована в одном городе - в Петербурге. Например, на долю Северо-Западного района, основу промышленности которого составляли заводы и фабрики Петербурга, приходилось около 10 % общего выпуска промышленной продукции России, 27,5 % металлообработки, 41,8 % судостроения и 57,6 % производства электротехники. В то время как в Саратовской губернии более 85 % предприятий региона были заняты обработкой продукции сельского хозяйства и животноводства, на долю остальных отраслей приходилось около 15 %. Таблица 5 Особенности промышленного развития Российской империи Ключевой фактор Стремительный рост производительных сил на базе крупной машинной индустрии; бурное развитие транспортной система (железнодорожная сеть) высокий уровень концентрации производства и рабочей силы; первые электроэнергетические проекты. Особенности Локализация промышленного производства в России в отдельных географических районах; участие иностранного капитала и, как следствие, вывоз сырья; сельскохозяйственная направленность. Факторы влияния города на окружающую территорию Формирование промзон и устойчивых ареалов воздушного загрязнения, изъятие природных ресурсов (добыча нефти и угля). Окончание таблицы 5 Основные источники загрязнения Паровой двигатель, железнодорожное строительство, транспорт, машино-, пароходостроение, угольная, станкоинструментальная, черная металлургия Меры по восстановлению качества окружающей среды Появление курортов, как освоение рекреационных ресурсов; первые поля фильтрации – один из самых дешевых способов очистить бытовые канализационные стоки. Бурный рост промышленности обусловлен привлечением иностранного капитала и дешевой рабочей силы. К началу XX века иностранные вложения составляли 45 % всего акционерного капитала, что в сумме равнялось 788 млн. рублей. Причем более половины этих денежных средств вкладывалось в горную, металлургическую и нефтяную промышленность. Индустриальная эпоха экологического загрязнения. Увеличением масштабов антропогенного воздействия в период с 1930- 1945-1955/1965 обусловлен формирование отраслей тяжелой промышленности, развитием ВПК и послевоенным восстановлением городов и экономики стран-участниц первой мировой войны. Таблица 6 Индустриальная эпоха экологического загрязнения Виды техногенного воздействия 1930-1941 1941-1945 1945-1955/1965 Ключевой фактор Формирование отраслей тяжелой промышленности Война, эвакуация, милитаризация экономики. Разрушение городов Конверсия, рост городов, увеличение масштабов строительства. Быстрые темпы роста населения. Основные источники загрязнения Тепловая энергетика, расцвет неорганической химии, меняющей структуру загрязнения. Интенсивное развитие ВПК. Рост интенсивности работы транспорта. Эвакуация предприятий и размещение их на новых площадках. Разрушение зеленых зон. Электротехническое, тяжелое машиностроение, производство и прокат стали, линии электропередач, неорганическая химия, цветная металлурги Формирующееся ядро нового периода Зарождение цветной металлургии, Зарождение радиационного загрязнения. Автомобилестроение, органическая химия, производство и переработка нефти, цветная металлургия, автодорожное строительство. Ускоряющийся темп урбанизации на современном этапе связан с дальнейшим расширением энергетических потребностей общества, появлением и развитием новых видов транспорта, увеличением системы коммунальных услуг, высоким, уровнем комфорта жизни, интеллектуального общения. Одна из величайших трагедий городов в том, что, будучи высшим достижением человеческой цивилизации, они становятся не только неудобными, но и в значительной степени опасными для жизни, даже для жизни будущих поколений. Групповые формы расселения ХХ-ХХI вв. характеризуются большей глубиной изменений в природной среде, распространением и концентрацией антропогенных нагрузок на обширных территориях. Экологическое неблагополучие городов стало острейшей глобальной проблемой современности. 3. Город – объект социально-экологического исследования Начиная с 2007 г. в городах обитает более половины населения мира. В 2018 г. в городах проживало 4,2 млрд человек — около 55% мирового населения на тот момент. Очевидно, что в дальнейшем будет продолжаться рост численности населения городов. Высказываются, например, такие предположения: к 2050 г. число городских жителей может составить в общей сложности 6,25 млрд человек, притом что 80% из них будет проживать в Африке и Азии. Здесь важно остановиться на вопросе роста антропогенного воздействия на окружающую среду, вызванного стремительной урбанизацией. В настоящее время рост урбанизации на 1% приводит к росту загрязнений в воздухе на 1,37%. Необычайно высокая антропогенная нагрузка в городах привела к формированию уникальных, отличных от естественных природных биогеоценозов – урбоэкосистем или техноценозов. Урбоэкосистема – территория, на которой сосредоточены население, жилые и промышленные здания, сооружения, зеленые насаждения. В урбоэкосистеме выделяют ряд функциональных зон: селитебную (заселенную людьми) и внеселитебную. Внеселитебная зона делится на промышленную, коммунально-складскую, санитарную, рекреационную (садово-парковую), зону отдыха, внешнего транспорта, прочих земель. Функциональное зонирование при планировке населенных пунктов позволяет выбирать территорию для размещения селитебных зон, прогнозировать рассеивание промышленных выбросов в приземных слоях атмосферы и определять величину санитарно-защитных зон. Преобразованная человеком урбоэкосистема, значительно отличается от естественных для данного региона экосистем. Экосистема города включает в себя природно-антропогенный комплекс, состоящий из биоценоза и биотопа, а также социальной и техногенной среды. Таблица 7 Отличия природной экосистемы от урбоэкосистемы Признак Природная экосистема Город Биотоп Климат Характерен для данной природной зоны Повышается температура, снижается влажность, увеличивается количество осадков, снижается солнечная радиация, уменьшается скорость ветра, увеличивается запыленность Почва Высокое содержание гумуса, высокая биогенность и биологическая активность почвы, хорошая аэрация, интенсивный почвообразовательный процесс Снижение плодородия, гумуса, биологической активности, повышение температуры, уплотнение, загрязнение, засоление, примесь антропогенного материала Рельеф Характерный микрорельеф, высота над уровнем моря Здания напоминают скальный ландшафт, образование отвалов при строительстве Биоценоз Продуценты Образование первичной продукции за счет фотосинтеза (ведущая роль продуцентов) Небольшой по объему, в основном декоративный компонент Консументы Соответствуют принципу пирамид биомассы Доминирует человек, бедное разнообразие представлено, главным образом, домашними животными и видами, существование которых связано с человеком Редуценты Минерализуют органическое вещество. Играют существенную роль Играют небольшую роль, так как большую часть отходов транспортируют за пределы города и там перерабатывают Окончание таблицы 7 Функция Поток энергии Энергия поступает преимущественно от Солнца Энергии Солнца не хватает: приток извне Круговорот веществ Сбалансированный, в большей части замкнутый. Разорванный. Два миграционных потока веществ: естественный и более интенсивный антропогенный Стабильность Сравнительно высокая, в состоянии динамического равновесия Низкая.

Рис. 1 Схема массообмена современного промышленного города (т/сутки) (по Д. П. Никитину, Ю. В. Новикову, 1986) Жизнедеятельность города – это последовательность непрерывных потоков энергии, веществ и продуктов их переработки. Интенсивность этих потоков зависит от численности и плотности городского населения, статуса города, вида и развития промышленности, объема и структуры транспорта. Модель города, составленная по принципу баланса, может быть показана следующим образом. В город поступают потоки электрической энергии, топлива, сырья, пищевых продуктов. После их переработки и получения продукции в пределах территории города, в атмосферу выбрасываются газы, аэрозоли, пыль, в пригородные воды сливаются промышленные и бытовые стоки, на городские свалки поступают отходы. Твердые бытовые отходы (ТБО) городов представляют собой смесь из бумаги (до 30 %), металла (до 49 %), пластика (3 %), пищевых отходов (до 30 %), дерева (3 %), текстиля (5 %), прочих (25 %). В городах выделяют следующие виды загрязнений (табл. 8): Таблица 8 Загрязнение окружающей среды в городах Вид загрязнения Источник Минеральное Сжигание топлива, отходы химического производства Органическое Пестициды, удобрения, нефтепродукты (автозаправочные станции, места стоянок транспорта), бытовые стоки, строительные материалы Механическое Твердые бытовые отходы Тепловое Дополнительные источники тепла: отопление зданий, промышленность, тепловое загрязнение водоемов Шумовое Автотранспорт, авиация; бытовой, производственный и уличный шум Окончание таблицы 8 Световое Отражение света от дороги, снега, блестящих поверхностей, освещение от фонарей Электромагнитное ЛЭП, радиотелевизионные станции, мобильные телефоны, электробытовые приборы Радиоактивное АЭС, гранитная отделка городов Биологическое: патогенные вирусы, бактерии, грибы Бытовые стоки, ТБО, микробиологические препараты, отходы пищевой и кожевенной промышленности, несанкционированные свалки, стоки животноводческих ферм в пригородах Информационное Избыток информации Ментальное Неправильные системы ценностей и образ жизни людей 3.2 Абиотический компонент городов Город способен накапливать значительное количество солнечного тепла и производить собственное за счет работы промышленных предприятий, электростанций и отопления. В черте города создается «остров тепла», где температура воздуха значительно выше, чем в прилегающей сельской местности. Это приводит к установлению особого режима циркуляции воздушных масс, называемого «городскими бризами». Загрязнение атмосферы приводит к формированию антропогенного аэрозоля, который уменьшает солнечную радиацию, увеличивает частоту туманов и провоцирует выпадение осадков. Увеличение осадков в городе усиливает засушливость прилегающей сельской местности. Таблица 9 Характеристика В сравнении с сельской местностью Общая солнечная радиация Меньше на 15–20 % Время солнечного сияния Меньше на 5–15 % Среднегодовая температура воздуха Больше на 0,5–1 о С Скорость ветра среднегодовая Меньше на 20–30 % Суммарные осадки Больше на 5–10 % Снегопады Меньше на 5 % Относительная влажность воздуха Меньше на 2–8 % Туман зимой Больше на 100 % Туман летом Больше на 30 % На формирование микроклимата города оказывают влияния такие факторы, как: 1) характер застройки, 2) размещение, ширина и направление застройки, а также 3) относительная однородность сформированной среды. Высокие строения образуют «бетонные ущелья» с низкой освещенностью и высокой скоростью ветра. Плотная застройка препятствует движению воздуха, вызывая застой загрязненных воздушных масс. Выравнивание местности под постройки снижает эрозионные процессы, но уменьшает дренирующие характеристики почв и увеличивает поверхностный сток. 3.3 Биотический компонент городов Рис. 2 Функции зеленых насаждений Зеленые насаждения, являясь частью планировочной структуры города, выполняют в нем разнообразные функции. Например, дерево средней величины за 24 часа восстанавливает столько кислорода, сколько необходимо для дыхания трех человек за тот же период времени. Зеленые насаждения в среднем за вегетационный период могут осадить до 40–60 т пыли с 1 гектара. Зеленые насаждения выполняют роль терморегулятора. Осуществляют аэрацию территории. Уменьшают радиацию. Кроны деревьев поглощают до 25 % звуковой энергии и примерно 75 % этой энергии отражают и рассеивают. Особенности почв города. В городах антропогенные факторы почвообразования преобладают над естественными факторами. Особенности почв на городских территориях (урбоназемов) состоят в следующем: 1. Отсутствие генетического горизонта до глубины 0,5 метров, вместо него присутствует пылевато-гумусовый субстрат с примесью (щебень, бой кирпича, стекла и других строительных отходов). 2. Преобладание насыпных почв с высокой дренированностью, нехваткой азота, малорастворимых солей и примесью мусора. 4. Наличие дорожных покрытий затрудняет обеспечение растений водой и кислородом. 5. Нагрев от асфальта и зданий приводит к увеличению испарения влаги летом. В жару влажность почвы находится в пределах мертвого запаса 2,5 %. 7. Применение реагентов для таяния льда, наличие водорастворимых сульфатов в городском мусоре приводит к засолению почв. 8. Уборка травы, листвы приводит к снижению доли гумуса, его доля в почвах города составляет всего 1–2 %. 9. Снижается биологическая активность – совокупность всех биологических процессов в почве (потребление кислорода и выделение углекислоты), выделение тепловой энергии организмами почвы и др … 4. Экология жилых помещений Городской житель подавляющую часть своей жизни проводит в помещениях зданий. В зависимости от образа жизни и условий трудовой деятельности он находится там от 52 до 85% суточного времени. Поэтому внутренняя среда оказывает влияние на его самочувствие, работоспособность, а также общую заболеваемость. Загрязняющие компоненты (ЗК), присутствующие внутри помещений, можно разделить на три группы: 1-е вызваны метаболической активностью человека (дыхание, выделение пота), например, 2-я группа: ЗК образуются непосредственно в помещении, например химические вещества, выделяемые из строительных и отделочных материалов, мебели. 3- я группа: ЗК поступают в здание из внешней среды. Определенный вклад в загрязнение жилой среды вносит сам человек, выделяя антропотоксины, т.е. вещества, являющиеся продуктами его жизнедеятельности человек, выделяя антропотоксины, т.е. вещества, являющиеся продуктами его жизнедеятельности. Дыхание, отделение пота и другие процессы, связанные с метаболической активностью человеческого организма, приводят к повышению влажности, появлению запахов. Качественный и количественный состав антропотоксинов зависит от пола, возраста, этнической принадлежности, состояния здоровья, характера пищи и т.п., а моча и кал несут около 400 субстанций. Среди антропотоксинов выделяются такие химические соединения, как сероводород, аммиак, диметиламины, метилстирол, фенол, бензол и др. Из-за незначительных концентраций эти вещества не проявляют явно выраженных отравляющих свойств. Тем не менее, они ухудшают самочувствие человека, снижают физическую и умственную работоспособность, ускоряют старение. К загрязнителям, образуемым внутри помещений, относятся: · химические вещества, выделяемые из строительных и отделочных материалов, мебели, предметов домашнего обихода; · продукты сгорания топлива (газ, дрова) в кухонных плитах, печах, каминах, водогрейных колонках; · вредные вещества, выделяемые в процессе приготовления пищи; · вещества, выделяемые из чистящих, дезинфицирующих, моющих средств и других предметов бытовой химии, а также средств личной гигиены и косметики; · инсектициды и другие средства борьбы с животными (тараканами, молью, мышами); · бытовой мусор и бытовые отходы; · домашняя пыль; · зоотоксины; · табачный дым. Загрязнителем помещений является пыль. В одной комнате за год образуется около 3 кг пыли. Она представляет собой сложную смесь различных веществ – ороговевшие частицы кожи человека, микрочастицы одежды, мебели, элементов отделки, строительных материалов, а также пыльца и растительные чешуйки, споры плесени, клещи и другие мельчайшие насекомые Источником загрязнения воздуха в квартире является кухня. При работе электро- и газовых плит, в процессе приготовления пищи и нагревания воды, образуются вредные вещества, изменяется степень ионизации воздуха, ухудшается температурно-влажностный режим среды. Особенно опасной считается газовая аппаратура – плиты и водогрейное оборудование. Загрязнителем офисов является озон. Он образуется при работе копировальных аппаратов и принтеров. Озон является отравляющим газом Организм человека подвергается воздействию большого количества химических веществ, мигрирующих из строительных конструкций, отделочных материалов, встроенной мебели. Далее вы можете ознакомиться переченем веществ, выделяющихся из строительных материалов. Таблица 10 Окончание таблицы 10 3. Пути экологического совершенствования города 5. Основные концепции экологичного жилья и устойчивых городов С древнейших времен люди были вынуждены жить в городах, построенных несколькими предыдущими поколениями, и лишь в мечтах они могли создать идеальные города, такие как «город Солнца» (Т. Кампанелла), «город-сад» (Э. Говард), «лучезарный город» (Л. Корбюзье). Лишь в конце XX века стало возможным строить города при жизни одного поколения и проектировать реальные города будущего. Одним из таких перспективных проектов является «город-сад». В конце ХIХ в Английский архитектор Эбенезер Горвард предложил свой проект «Город-сад». Это поселение площадью около 240 га с радиально-кольцевой планировкой и населением 32 тыс. чел. Жилые дома занимают 1/6 часть площади. Остальная же площадь отводится под сельскохозяйственные культуры, сады, огороды и т.д. Этот сельскохозяйственный пояс является резервуаром чистого воздуха для города и поставляет его жителям продукты Ответом на «дезурбанистическую» концепцию города-сада стал проект французского архитектора Тони Гарнье. Он впервые применил принцип функционального зонирования города на четыре категории: рекреационно-жилую, промышленную, рабочую, транспортную зоны, между ними - железнодорожная станция и зелёный пояс В 1922 году французский архитектор Ле Корбюзье создаёт проект города на 3 млн. жителей, известный как «Лучезарный город». Центром города задумывается объединённый многоярусный вокзал на пересечении главных железных и автомобильных дорог. Его окружают свободно стоящие в зелёном массиве небоскрёбы делового центра в 60 этажей; вокруг них - ленточная жилая, а затем - малоэтажная застройка. С противоположных сторон к городу примыкают промышленная и рекреационная зоны. Современного человека подобный план уже не удивляет, но тогда это был прорыв. Его идеи повлияли на современное городское планирование. Массовое появление концепций устойчивых городов можно наблюдать в 1980–1990 гг.: они появились после выхода резонансных работ, в которых звучали опасения по поводу ухудшения экологии, исчерпания ресурсов, ошибочных принципов городского планирования и развития, а также выхода человечества на траекторию неустойчивого развития. Рассмотрим некоторые из них. Экологичный город — новый тип города, в котором природная среда находится в состоянии экологического равновесия с урбанизированной средой. Одним из таких является экогород Ричирда Реджистера. Ключевая идея: «Потребление только минимально необходимых природных ресурсов, максимальная независимость от окружающей среды благодаря использованию возобновляемых источников энергии». Основными чертами экогорода являются: экологичные дома, экологически чистый общественный транспорт, пешеходные зоны, раздельный сбор мусора, повторная переработка отходов, «живые и зеленые» крыши, экологически чистые продукты питания, которые жители выращивают прямо в городской черте, и т.д. Экологичные дома или экодома. Их особенности: малоэтажное строительство, «солнечная архитектура»: северный фасад глухой с небольшими окнами, а широкий фасад с большими окнами ориентирован на юг. Гибридные солнечно-ветровые электрогенерирующие системы позволяют использовать энергию ветра или солнца. Индивидуальный или коллективный источник воды и стокоочистительные установки. Сортировка отходов. Регулировка отопления в зависимости от погоды. Каркасная технология домостроения с применением специальных панелей из экологичных материалов. Окна позволяющие создавать оптимальный микроклимат без специального проветривания. Территориально-транспортные концепции (ТТК) возникли в противовес растущей автомобилизации и бесконтрольному разрастанию городов; рассматривают город как новую среду обитания, которая позволит ходить пешком и стимулировать использование общественного транспорта, в том числе административными мерами – введением платных парковок, ограничениями на въезд в центр города и т.д. Идеи городов: • Компактный город с развитыми пешеходными и велосипедными зонами и системой общественного транспорта. • Город, в центре которого удобные для пешеходов микрорайоны площадью до 45 га, соединенные маршрутами общественного транспорта • «Деревни внутри городов» – компактные поселки диаметром до километра, сочетающие преимущества жизни в городе и деревне Современные концепции экогорода 2000–2010-х гг.: «зеленые» технологии, «зеленый» рост и решение социальных проблем. • Углерод – нейтральный город: предполагает полный отказ от импорта угля, нефти, газа и продуктов их переработки, переход на возобновляемые источники энергии и экологически чистый транспорт, стимулирование пешеходного движения и велопоездок, строительство энергоэффективных и умных зданий; торговля квотами на выбросы СО2 и т.д. • Климат – нейтральный город. Предполагает лишь сокращение импорта ресурсов, повышение эффективности использования ресурсов за счет системы управления, направленной на сокращение автомобильного трафика, развитие альтернативной энергетики • Город без машин. Практически полный отказ от машин. «Умные» города и природоподобные технологии. Компоненты и особенности: «Умная» среда, в которой природные ресурсы используются рационально, экономно и энергоэффективно, при этом экосистема города находится под постоянной защитой. Умные» люди, которые высококвалифицированы, участвуют в общественной жизни и имеют доступ к различным образовательным ресурсам. «Умная» мобильность, подразумевающая, что транспорт в городе эффективен и экологичен. «Умный» образ жизни, означающий, что город комфортен для жизни людей в нем, а сами горожане рациональны в потреблении ресурсов, а также имеют все инструменты для социализации и поддержки своего здоровья. «Умная» экономика — продуктивная, гибкая и инновационная.«Умное» управление, в которое вовлечены горожане, имеющие широкий доступ к различным данным. Для устойчивого развития современных «умных» городов возможно применять так называемые природоподобные технологии (nature-based solutions). Природоподобные технологии рассматриваются как инновации для решения экологических, социальных и экономических проблем города, таких как адаптация к изменению климата и снижение выбросов парниковых газов, улучшение качества воздуха, снижение потерь биоразнообразия, уязвимость водных ресурсов и городских экосистем, обеспечение продовольственной безопасности, улучшение социального и экономического положения и здоровья людей. 5.1 Экологизация городов Экологизация городов предполагает одновременное улучшение состояния природной среды и повышение качества жизни населения. Она направлена на решение двух взаимосвязанных проблем: 1 — экологизация существующих городов путем создания новых, полностью экологичных кварталов и микрорайонов; 2 — строительство новых экологичных городов (экополисов). Работа в данном направлении начинается с разработки комплексной долгосрочной программы устойчивого развития города. Такая программа включает меры по экологизации всех направлений жизнедеятельности города — от обеспечения чистоты воздуха, воды и почвы до экологизации транспорта, промышленности, энергокомплекса и других городских структур. Основные объекты преобразований — здания, строения и сооружения; почва и растительность города; объекты транспортной инфраструктуры (дороги, парковочные площадки, тротуары и др.). Направления экологизации зданий, строений и сооружений: ✓ возведение зданий из экологически чистых, естественных материалов, позволяющих создать благоприятную внутреннюю среду; ✓ строительство зданий нового типа с накоплением и повторным использованием внутреннего тепла; сбережением энергии, возможным использованием возобновляемой энергии; ✓ постепенный переход к строительству зданий, в которых используются технологии ресурсосбережения: уменьшение расхода воды, частичная утилизация органических отходов для производства компоста, гумуса и т.д.; ✓ уход от однообразного прямоугольного стиля зданий к стилю, хорошо воспринимаемому зрением: с разнообразием деталей, цвета, ландшафтных решений; создание близких к природным и благоприятных для жителей города визуальных, звуковых и запаховых полей; ✓ широкое освоение подземного пространства: строительство второго, подземного города; составление и утверждение перечня объектов, которые в дальнейшем будет нецелесообразно и/или запрещено размещать на поверхности (например: гаражи, склады, кинотеатры, торговые центры, транспортные сооружения и т.д.). Экологический подход к сохранению почвенно-растительного слоя в городе: — максимальное сохранение поверхности земли с почвенно-растительным слоем от застройки благодаря новым конструктивным решениям; например: возведение зданий, поднятых над поверхностью земли на сваях; надземно-подземные здания, поднятые над землей и имеющие развитую подземную часть; — максимально возможное озеленение не только земли, но и стен зданий, инженерных сооружений и кровель устойчивыми к загрязнениям видами растений; озеленение внутренних объемов зданий; — создание сначала квартальной, районной, а затем и общегородской сети «зеленых коридоров» — комплекса естественных и искусственно созданных озелененных территорий, не пересекающихся в одном уровне с транспортными сетями и соединенных с загородными лесами и парками; — возведение озелененных шумозащитных экранов (стен) вдоль наиболее нагруженных транспортных магистралей, а также подпорных стен, заборов, опор освещения и пр.; — сокращение площади непроницаемых для воды покрытий (асфальт, бетон); максимальное использование специальной тротуарной плитки, обеспечивающей проницаемость за счет стыковочных швов; использование покрытий с озеленением части грунта.

Развитие техносферы прошло через биотехническую, урбанистическую, промышленную и научно-техническую революции, каждая из которых усиливала влияние человека на окружающую среду. 2. **Экология городской среды**: Города представляют собой сложные экосистемы, сильно измененные человеком. Они создают \\"острова тепла\\", изменяют микроклимат и ландшафт, и оказывают давление на природные ресурсы. Промышленный рост ускорил урбанизацию, приведя к массовому строительству и расширению городских территорий. 3. **Загрязнение в городах**: Городские территории характеризуются высоким уровнем загрязнения, включая воздушное загрязнение, загрязнение почвы и воды, шумовое, световое и электромагнитное загрязнение. Источниками являются транспорт, промышленные выбросы, отходы жизнедеятельности населения и строительная деятельность. 4. **Экологический дизайн городов**: Современные экологические концепции стремятся создать условия для взаимодействия человека и природы, сохраняя при этом комфорт жизни в городе. Ключевое значение придается развитию \\"зеленой\\" инфраструктуры, устойчивому использованию ресурсов, снижению уровня загрязнений и созданию экологически чистого и энергоэффективного городского транспорта. 5. **Урбоэкосистемы**: При преобразовании городов очень важно учитывать создание урбоэкосистем, которые включают обширную \\"зеленую\\" инфраструктуру, способствует снижению уровня загрязнения, и обеспечивает биоразнообразие. Зеленые насаждения служат \\"легкими города\\", адаптируя городскую среду к естественным циклам. 6. **Стратегии экологизации городов**: Экологическое переосмысление городов включает уменьшение загрязнения, эффективное использование энергии и ресурсов, развитие инфраструктуры для пешеходов и велосипедистов, а также создание общественных пространств, способствующих повышению качества жизни горожан. 7. **\\"Умные\\" города и природоподобные технологии**: Внедрение \\"умных\\" технологий и природоподобных решений способствует созданию эффективных, устойчивых и жизнеспособных городских экосистем, в которых обеспечивается баланс между развитием городской инфраструктуры и сохранением природной среды."},{"prompt":"Write a socratic dialogue that talks about the controversy around AI art. The dialogue must contain Socrates in the “pro AI” position, while the other locutor is in the “anti AI” position. The other locutor must use the most common arguments against AI art, like “AI art is stealing from artists”, while Socrates must use the socratic method to dig deeper into the other locutor's assumptions.","completion":"**Socrates**: Greetings, my friend. I hear you harbor concerns regarding the emergence of art created by artificial intelligence. Would you share your thoughts with me? **Alex**: Of course, Socrates. My main concern is that AI art is stealing from living artists. The AI draws upon existing artworks to create something new, without compensating the original creators. This seems both unethical and harmful to the artistic community. **Socrates**: A serious concern indeed. Tell me, when you speak of stealing, you imply that something belonging to someone has been taken without permission. Is that correct? **Alex**: Exactly, Socrates. **Socrates**: Now, consider this—when a traditional artist creates a new piece, do they not draw upon the ideas, styles, and techniques developed by those who came before them? Is this also a form of borrowing? **Alex**: Well, yes, but artists interpret and transform those influences into something unique. They add their conscious experience and interpretation to their work. **Socrates**: A valid point. Then, might we consider whether an AI, in compiling and processing vast amounts of data, could also be said to transform and interpret its 'influences' in producing something new? More broadly, could we see this process as a new form of \\"creating\\" rather than \\"stealing\\"? **Alex**: I suppose you could see it that way, but it still doesn't change the fact that AI is threatening artists' livelihoods. Why buy art from a human if an AI can churn out pieces more quickly and perhaps more cheaply? **Socrates**: Indeed, the economic implications are worth considering. Let us think of the first tools humans made to aid in hunting. Did these tools not make the hunt less laborious and more fruitful? **Alex**: They did, but your point? **Socrates**: My point is, every technological advancement has reshaped the economic landscape of its time. Rather than replacing humans, have we not found that technology ultimately creates new opportunities, new markets, and new demands? **Alex**: So, you're saying AI might open up new opportunities for artists? **Socrates**: Precisely. Could we not envision a future where artists collaborate with AI, using it as a tool to enhance their creativity, much like the painter uses the brush? **Alex**: That's an interesting notion, but it still feels like AI could devalue human creativity. If anyone can produce a masterpiece at the click of a button, what's the value of learning and mastering the craft? **Socrates**: A valid concern. But tell me, does not the value of art also lie in its meaning, its context, and the story behind it? Could the story of human struggle, emotion, and insight be replicated by an AI, regardless of the superficial similarity? **Alex**: No, I suppose not. The human experience is unique and can't be replicated by machines. **Socrates**: Then might we say that instead of devaluing human creativity, AI challenges us to delve deeper into the essence of what makes our creations truly human and valuable? **Alex**: I hadn't considered it that way. But how do we ensure that artists still thrive in this new AI-influenced landscape? **Socrates**: An important question indeed, which society must answer by fostering a dialogue between technology and tradition, ensuring equitable distribution of this new tool's benefits. Could not the very concerns you've raised spark discussions that ultimately lead to policies and practices benefiting both artists and society? **Alex**: Perhaps you're right, Socrates. There's a lot I need to think about. **Socrates**: My friend, questioning and thinking deeply about these challenges is the first step toward understanding and solving them. Let us continue this dialogue, for it is through such discussions that wisdom and progress are born."},{"prompt":"Doğa bilimleri kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve duyumları öne çıkaran pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile sosyal bilim kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair duyumları aşan bir apriori önkabulü, inancı, hatta imanı esas alan materyalizm ve naturalizmin karşılaşmasında, özellikle Mach'a karşı Lenin'in yazdığı Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm kitabı bağlamında ortaya çıkan bu karşılaşmada; emprist taraf fizikte gözlem imkanları yetersiz olduğu için atomların varlığına bile şüpheyle bakarken materyalist taraf Demokritos ve Epikür'e kadar uzanan uzak bir geçmişte bile atomu teorik bir önkabul olarak var kabul ediyordu, ki Marx'ın doktora tezi bu iki atomcu filozof hakkındaydı; nasıl oldu da fizik gibi bir doğa biliminde, doğa bilimci empristler (Mach ve Viyana çevresi felsefecileri) sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx dışında felsefe eğitimi almamış amatörler Engels, Lenin vb.) gerisine düşebildirle? Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte empristler de gecikmeli olarak atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","completion":"Bu soruda betimlenen durum; bilimin, felsefenin ve ideolojilerin etkileşiminin karmaşık bir örneğini sunmaktadır. Pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm gibi duyumları öne çıkaran yaklaşımlarla, ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair apriori kabulleri benimseyen materyalizm ve naturalizm arasındaki karşılaşma, bilim ve felsefe tarihinde önemli bir dönüm noktasına işaret eder. Özellikle, Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" kitabında Mach ve onun gibi düşünenlerle yaptığı polemik bu çatışmanın merkezinde yer alır. Fiziğin kendisi ve onun gelişimi, bu tartışmanın odak noktasıdır. 19. ve özellikle 20. yüzyılın başlarında fizikte yaşanan devrimler (örneğin, atom teorisinin ve sonra kuantum mekaniğinin gelişimi), fiziksel gerçekliğin doğasına dair temel varsayımların yeniden değerlendirilmesini gerektirdi. 19. yüzyılın sonu ve 20. yüzyılın başı, fizikte atomun varlığının açıkça kanıtlandığı ve atom teorisinin kabul gördüğü bir döneme denk gelir. Empristler, yani deneyim ve gözleme dayalı bilgiyi öne çıkaranlar, özellikle Mach ve Viyana Çevresi felsefecileri gibi, bilimsel bilginin yalnızca gözlemlenebilir fenomenlere dayanması gerektiğini savunuyorlardı. Bu yaklaşım, deneysel kanıtların yetersiz olduğu durumlarda (örneğin atomların varlığı gibi) şüpheciliğe yol açtı. Ancak, deneysel tekniklerin ve teorik fiziksel anlayışın gelişmesiyle birlikte, atomların ve sonrasında subatomik parçacıkların varlığı gözlemlenebilir ve ölçülebilir hale geldi. Bu durum, bir noktada emprik yaklaşımı dahi atomlar ve temel parçacıkların var olduğu konusunda ikna etti. Öte yandan, materyalist yaklaşım, özellikle de Marx, Engels ve Lenin gibi düşünürlerin savunduğu şekliyle, maddenin ve onun hareketlerinin temel öneminde olan ontolojik öncüller üzerine kuruludur. Bu düşünürler, fiziksel dünyanın temel yapıtaşlarının varlığını, bunların gözlemlenip gözlemlenememesinden bağımsız olarak, teorik bir çerçeve içerisinde kabul ettiler. Lenin, \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" adlı eserinde bu konuda empirist ve pozitivist yaklaşımlara karşı çıkarken, materyalist felsefenin bilimsel gelişmelere ayak uydurabileceğini ve hatta onları doğru anlamada yönlendirebileceğini savundu. Sonuç olarak, sosyal bilim kökenli düşünürlerin (Lenin gibi) doğa bilimlerinin temel sorunlarına dair geliştirdiği teorik çerçeveler, deneysel ve gözlemsel kanıtların ışığında kendilerini yeniden şekillendirebilmiş ve önemli ölçüde sürdürülebilir kalmıştır.

Solo deseo vivir en paz y tranquilidad, sin que me molesten. Ya he vivido una vida llena de peleas y luchas para salvar y proteger a otros y no tengo deseos de seguir con eso. He vivido entrenando para ser lo suficientemente fuerte para cumplir con ese propósito; claro que una parte de mí disfrutaba enormemente eso. Después de todo, mi esencia es la de un Saiyajin y nunca rechacé esa parte de mí mismo. Aún así, luego de tantas batallas, peleas y entrenamiento, luego de una vida plena de lo que más deseaba - luchar y ser más fuerte - terminé mi camino sin prestar atención a los que me rodeaban. Por eso, al final, no pude establecer relaciones de amistad verdaderas, ni siquiera llegué a apreciar los sentimientos de varias personas que me amaban. Al final, aunque logré lo que quería - ser el más fuerte, alcanzar un nivel más allá de cualquier otro - terminé completamente solo. Mientras vivía de esa forma, mi ser se fue cediendo a mi esencia como Saiyajin. Solo me concentré en aprender técnicas, habilidades y capacidades con las cuales podría ser más hábil y capaz al pelear. Realicé entrenamientos que me exigieron más allá de lo posible; en aquellos momentos, obtuve conocimientos y verdades tanto de mi raza como de mí mismo y del universo. Entrené y entrené, sin prestar atención a lo que verdaderamente importaba. Y, al final, una de las personas que más admiraba me lo arrebató todo. En ese momento comprendí que la fuerza no se debe conseguir solo porque se desee, sino que la fuerza es para proteger a otros y el poder es para asegurar su bienestar. Aun así, en esta vida no deseo tener una vida llena de luchas y batallas sin sentido. No me importa si alguien, al otro lado del mundo, está muriendo; de una u otra forma, no actuaré como héroe e iré a salvarlo solo porque sea lo correcto por poseer la capacidad de hacerlo. Yo no soy un héroe y jamás lo seré; de hecho, no quiero serlo. Soy un guerrero por naturaleza; mi instinto y mi esencia es la de luchar y fortalecerme, y no rechazo ni niego esa parte de mí mismo. Aun con todo lo que pasó en mi vida anterior, aun quiero ser más fuerte, pero también quiero disfrutar de la sencillez de vivir mi vida. Quiero aprender de todo, conocer a muchas personas, ya sean buenas o malas; disfrutar de cosas tan simples como tomar un respiro de aire fresco hasta aprender una nueva técnica, me sirva o no. Quiero saber de lo que me perdí en mi vida anterior. Quiero conocer a personas, sentir emociones y sentimientos, querer a alguien más allá de por su fuerza y capacidad. Quiero aprender a apreciar el ser querido, apreciado y amado. Quiero saber lo que es querer, amar y aceptar a otros, más allá de fijarme en su presencia, si es débil o fuerte. Quiero aprender a vivir y, por eso, no puedo ser un héroe; y por eso no quiero serlo. Lo siento mucho, Bárbara, sé que soy egoísta, es parte de mi esencia. Siempre lo ha sido y siempre lo será, y lo he aceptado. Soy egoísta, y si eso hace que me rechacen o me odien, incluso si eso hace que traten de matarme, no me importa.

Deseo explorar el significado profundo de mi existencia, más allá de las batallas y las conquistas que antaño definieron mi ser. Comprendo que hay una riqueza en las experiencias cotidianas, en los pequeños momentos que antes pasé por alto, obnubilado por mi sed de poder y fortaleza. Ahora, al mirar hacia adelante, anhelo confeccionar una vida que abrace tanto la simplicidad como la profundidad de las conexiones humanas. No niego que el llamado de la batalla y el ansia de superación aún resuenan en mi interior; es parte de quién soy. Sin embargo, he aprendido que la verdadera fuerza reside en la capacidad de mostrar compasión, de tender una mano amiga y de amar sin reservas. Estas son las batallas que ahora escojo luchar. Es un tipo de valentía distinta, que requiere una fortaleza de carácter mucho más compleja que simplemente vencer en combate. En mi proceso de autoexploración, también he descubierto que ser egoísta no es intrínsecamente malo. Un cierto grado de egoísmo es necesario para preservar el propio bienestar. No obstante, el equilibrio radica en saber cuándo poner a los demás antes que a uno mismo, cuándo sacrificar algo personal por el bienestar de otros. Ese, creo, es el verdadero marcaje de un héroe, aunque no me considero uno. Si puedo aprender a bailar al borde de este cuchillo de doble filo, tal vez encuentre la paz que tanto busco. Mirando hacia el futuro, me imagino formando lazos genuinos, aprendiendo de cada persona con quien me cruce. Quiero absorber sus historias, sus esperanzas y temores, y ver cómo estos se entrelazan con los míos. No deseo huir del amor o de la amistad por temor a la vulnerabilidad; al contrario, quiero abrazar esos sentimientos con toda mi ser. Dichas conexiones son, después de todo, lo que verdaderamente enriquecen la vida. Estoy consciente de que este viaje no será fácil. Desaprender una vida de lucha y reprimir instintos arraigados requerirá tiempo y paciencia. Pero estoy preparado para enfrentar estos desafíos, para caer y levantarme tantas veces como sea necesario. Porque ahora, más que nunca, entiendo que la vida no se mide por las victorias en el campo de batalla, sino por los momentos de conexión genuina, por las risas compartidas y por el amor que somos capaces de dar y recibir. Así que, con el corazón abierto y la mente dispuesta a aprender, doy los primeros pasos en esta nueva senda. Es un camino desconocido, pero uno que estoy dispuesto a recorrer.

Ambos desempenham um papel crucial em diversas áreas, como economia, medicina, engenharia, ciências sociais, entre outras. Vamos explorar cada um deles separadamente: # Estatística A estatística é a ciência que se ocupa da coleta, análise, interpretação e apresentação de dados. Ela é fundamentalmente dividida em dois ramos principais: descritiva e inferencial. 1. **Estatística Descritiva**: Lida com a descrição e síntese dos dados. Seu objetivo é resumir ou descrever as características principais de um conjunto de dados de forma quantitativa. Utiliza medidas de tendência central (média, mediana, moda), medidas de dispersão (variância, desvio padrão, amplitude) e representações gráficas (histogramas, gráficos de barra, gráficos de dispersão) para descrever o conjunto de dados. 2. **Estatística Inferencial**: Baseia-se na ideia de que podemos tirar conclusões ou fazer inferências sobre uma população a partir de uma amostra representativa. Com a estatísticas inferencial, usamos técnicas como estimação de parâmetros, testes de hipóteses, regressão e análise de variância para generalizar os resultados encontrados na amostra para a população maior. # Probabilidade Probabilidade é o ramo da matemática que estuda a chance ou a possibilidade de ocorrência de eventos. É a fundamentação teórica das estatísticas, especialmente da estatística inferencial. A probabilidade de um evento pode variar de 0 a 1, onde 0 indica impossibilidade e 1 indica certeza absoluta. Principais conceitos incluem: 1. **Experimento Aleatório**: Um processo que leva a um dos possíveis resultados, onde o resultado específico é incerto. 2. **Espaço Amostral**: Conjunto de todos os possíveis resultados de um experimento aleatório. 3. **Evento**: Qualquer subconjunto do espaço amostral. A probabilidade pode ser classificada em dois tipos principais: clássica e experimental. A probabilidade clássica refere-se a situações onde todos os resultados são igualmente prováveis, enquanto a probabilidade experimental (ou empírica) baseia-se na frequência com que um evento ocorre, após a realização de muitos experimentos. # Relação Entre Estatística e Probabilidade A relação entre estatística e probabilidade é profunda e fundamental. A estatística utiliza os conceitos de probabilidade para inferir propriedades de populações desconhecidas a partir de amostras. A probabilidade, por outro lado, fornece os fundamentos teóricos e métodos para quantificar a incerteza, que são essenciais para a interpretação estatística e tomada de decisões. Em resumo, enquanto a estatística lida mais diretamente com dados reais e sua análise, a probabilidade lida com a modelagem teórica da incerteza associada a esses dados e eventos. Ambos são indispensáveis na análise de dados e na pesquisa científica, contribuindo significativamente para nossa compreensão do mundo e para o avanço tecnológico e científico."},{"prompt":"mim ensine Estatística e Probabilidade","completion":"Estou aqui para ajudá-lo a entender os conceitos básicos da Estatística e Probabilidade, duas áreas fundamentais da matemática e essenciais para diversas disciplinas como a medicina, economia, engenharia e nas ciências sociais. Vamos começar! # Estatística Estatística é o ramo da matemática que lida com a coleta, análise, interpretação, apresentação e organização de dados. Ela permite tomar decisões com base em dados. A Estatística geralmente divide-se em duas grandes áreas: 1. **Estatística Descritiva**: Foca na organização, sumarização e apresentação dos dados de maneira informativa. Isso inclui calcular médias, mediana, moda, variância, desvio padrão e elaborar gráficos e tabelas para uma compreensão visual dos dados. 2. **Estatística Inferencial**: Aplica métodos que permitem tirar conclusões e fazer previsões baseadas em dados de uma amostra para toda a população. Isso envolve o uso de técnicas como estimativas de ponto, intervalos de confiança, testes de hipóteses e análise de regressão. # Probabilidade Probabilidade é a medida da possibilidade de um evento ocorrer. É uma maneira de quantificar a incerteza envolvendo fenômenos. Vamos abordar alguns conceitos-chave: - **Experimento Aleatório**: É um processo que, quando repetido, pode produzir resultados diferentes. - **Espaço Amostral (S)**: Conjunto de todos os possíveis resultados de um experimento aleatório. - **Evento**: Qualquer subconjunto do espaço amostral. Um evento ocorre se o resultado do experimento for um membro desse conjunto. Conceitos Fundamentais 1. **Regra da Adição (ou União)**: A probabilidade de um ou outro evento, A ou B, ocorrer é igual à soma das probabilidades de cada evento, subtraindo a probabilidade de ambos ocorrerem. Matematicamente, (P(A cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A cap B)). 2. **Regra da Multiplicação (ou Interseção)**: A probabilidade de dois eventos, A e B, ocorrerem em sequência é (P(A) times P(B|A)), onde (P(B|A)) é a probabilidade de B ocorrer dado que A já ocorreu. 3. **Probabilidade Condicional**: (P(A|B)) é a probabilidade de A dado que B ocorre. Basicamente, restrinjimos nosso espaço amostral aos eventos onde B ocorre. 4. **Eventos Independentes**: Dois eventos são independentes se a ocorrência de um não afeta a probabilidade de ocorrência do outro. Para eventos independentes, (P(A cap B) = P(A) times P(B)). 5. **Teorema de Bayes**: Permite atualizar a probabilidade de um evento com base em novas evidências. Variáveis Aleatórias e Distribuições - **Variável Aleatória**: Uma função que associa a cada resultado de um experimento um valor numérico. Elas podem ser discretas ou contínuas, dependendo do tipo de valores que assumem. - **Distribuição de Probabilidade**: Descreve como as probabilidades são distribuídas entre os possíveis valores de uma variável aleatória. Exemplos incluem a Distribuição Binomial, Distribuição Normal, entre outras. Em resumo, Estatística e Probabilidade fornecem ferramentas fundamentais para entendermos e interpretarmos os dados e a incerteza em nossas observações e experimentos.

Felsefe ve bilim tarihinde, doğa bilimleri kökenli empristler ile sosyal bilim kökenli materyalistler arasındaki bu karşılaşma, son derece ilginç bir paradoksun altını çizer. Öncelikle, bu iki grubun pozisyonlarını ve aralarındaki farklılıkları netleştirelim. Empristler, duyusal deneyime ve gözleme dayalı bir bilgi anlayışını savunurlar. Bu perspektife göre, bilgi ancak doğrudan deneyim ve gözlemle doğrulanabilirse geçerli kabul edilir. Atomların varlığı gibi doğrudan gözlenemeyen teorik kavramlara kuşkuyla yaklaşırlar. 19. yüzyılın sonlarında ve 20. yüzyılın başlarında, özellikle Ernst Mach ve Viyana Çevresi gibi düşünürler bu yaklaşımın öncülerindendir. Materyalistler ise, maddenin temel ve değişmez bir özelliği olduğunu ve düşüncenin maddi koşullardan kaynaklandığını savunurlar. Bu perspektife göre, maddi dünya duyumların ötesinde apriori bir varlık olarak kabul edilir ve düşünce maddi dünyanın bir yansımasıdır. Marksizm, bu düşünce biçiminin en bilinen temsilcisidir ve Karl Marx ile Friedrich Engels tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" kitabı da bu düşünce tarzının savunuculuğunu yapar. Mach gibi empristlerin atomların varlığına şüpheyle yaklaşması, onların doğrudan gözlem ve deneyime dayalı epistemolojik yaklaşımlarıyla uyumludur. Buna karşılık, Lenin ve diğer sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin materyalist felsefeleri, teorik önermelerin ve kavramların duyuların ötesindeki gerçeklikleri keşfetmede kullanılabilen geçerli araçlar olduğunu öne sürer. Bu karşılaşmanın ana çelişkisi, bilgi ve gerçekliğin doğasına dair temel felsefi sorulara dayanır. Özellikle, bilgi nasıl elde edilir ve gerçeklik nasıl tanımlanır? Bu soruların cevapları, empristler ile materyalistler arasındaki temel anlaşmazlıkları oluşturur. Fizik ve diğer doğa bilimlerinde, 20. yüzyıl başlarındaki deneyler ve teorik gelişmeler (örneğin, kuantum mekaniği ve atom yapısına dair araştırmalar), atomların varlığını ve doğanın temel yapıtaşlarını doğruladı. Bu gelişmeler, sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin teorik öngörülerinin, doğa bilimleri alanındaki emprist yaklaşımlara kıyasla, belirli meselelerde daha öngörülebilir olduğunu gösterdi. Burada, materyalistlerin doğru anlayışa ulaşmalarının ana nedeni, onların maddi gerçeklik hakkındaki geniş kapsamlı, teorik açıklayıcı çerçeveleri benimsemelerinden kaynaklanabilir. Bu, doğa bilimleri alanındaki emprist yaklaşımların zaman zaman sınırlı gözlem ve deney alanlarına bağlı kalmasının bir sonucu olarak görülebilir. Sonuç olarak, bu karşılaşma bilginin ve gerçekliğin doğası hakkındaki derin felsefi soruları ve bilim ile felsefenin nasıl birbirleriyle etkileşimde bulunduğunu vurgular. Her iki yaklaşımın da kendi içinde tutarlılıkları ve güçlü yönleri olduğu gibi, sınırlılıkları ve zayıf noktaları da vardır.

İki farklı düşünce ekolü olan pozitivizm/emprisizm ile materyalizm/naturalizm arasındaki çatışma, bilimin temel prensipleri ve doğruluk kriterleri üzerine odaklanmıştır. Mach gibi emprist doğa bilimciler, duyumlar ve gözlemler olmadan yapılan her türlü teorik önermeyi şüpheyle karşılayarak, duyumsal verilere dayanan bir bilim anlayışını savunmuşlardır. Öte yandan, Lenin gibi materyalist düşünürler, duyum ötesi (apriori) önermelere ve teorilere de yer veren, daha geniş bir düşünce sistemi geliştirmişlerdir. Soruda, doğa bilimleri kökenli pozitivist/empristler ile sosyal bilim kökenli materyalistler/naturalistler arasındaki karşılaştırmada ortaya çıkan, bilgi ve varlık teorisi ile ilgili temel bir paradigmalar çatışması ele alınmaktadır.

Burada önemli olan, bilimsel ilerlemenin hem teorik hem de deneysel çalışmaların birbirini tamamlayıcı doğasıyla gerçekleştiğidir. Sonuç olarak, bu tartışma, bilimin doğasının nasıl bir süreç olduğunu, bilgi ve gerçekliğin doğrulanması için hem duyusal verilerin (emprisizm/pozitivizm) hem de duyum ötesi teorik çerçevelerin (materyalizm/naturalizm) önem taşıdığını gösterir.

Öncelikle, doğa bilimleri ve sosyal bilimler arasındaki bu karşılaşmada, felsefi yaklaşımların bilimin ilerlemesi üzerinde önemli bir etkisi olduğunu söyleyebiliriz. Ancak, bu etkileri değerlendirirken, belli başlı faktörleri göz önünde bulundurmak gerekir. 1. **Felsefi Yaklaşımların Bilim Üzerindeki Etkisi:** Pozitivizm ve empiro-kritisizm gibi yaklaşımlar, bilginin yalnızca deney ve gözleme dayanarak edinilebileceğini savunur. Bu tür yaklaşımlar, bilimdeki ilerlemeler için gerekli metodolojik çerçeveyi sağlamıştır. Ancak, bu yaklaşımlar aynı zamanda deneyim dışında bilgi kaynaklarını sınırlar veya reddeder, bu da bazı durumlarda bilimsel ilerlemeyi kısıtlayabilir. 2. **Teorik Önkabullerin Bilimi Şekillendirmesi:** Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Empriyo-Kritisizm\\" eserinde ele aldığı gibi, materyalist yaklaşım evrenin maddi varlığına önceden var olan bir inancı, hatta bir önkabulu esas alır. Bu tür bir önkabul, daha sonra doğrulanabilecek hipotezler üretmek adına önemli olabilir. Demokritos ve Epikür’ün atom teorisine olan materyalist ilgi, teorik fizikteki daha sonraki gelişmelerle uyum göstererek, sonuçta haklı çıkan bir öngörüyü temsil etmiştir. 3. **Bilimsel Gelişmeler ve Paradigma Değişiklikleri:** Bilimsel bilgi birikimi, sadece deney ve gözleme dayalı değil, aynı zamanda mevcut teorik çerçevelere, varsayımlara ve öncüller içinde ilerler. Bu, Thomas Kuhn'un bilimsel devrimler ve paradigmalar teorisinde vurgulandığı üzere, bilimdeki önemli ilerlemelerin genellikle mevcut paradigmalara meydan okuyan teorik çerçevelerle gerçekleştiğini gösterir. Fizikte atomların varlığının kabul edilmesi, yeni gözlem ve deney imkanlarının geliştirilmesiyle desteklenen teorik bir çerçevenin sonucuydu. Sonuç olarak, doğa bilimci empristlerle sosyal bilimci materyalistler arasındaki bu karşılaşma, bilim tarihinde felsefi yaklaşımların ve teorik öncüllerin önemini vurgular. Bilimin ilerlemesi sıklıkla, mevcut bilgiyi sınırlayan varsayımları aşma kabiliyetine sahip yeni teorik çerçevelerin ortaya çıkışına bağlıdır.

Mach ve Viyana çevresi gibi empristler, duyulara dayalı bilgiyi esas aldıkları için, o dönemde henüz doğrudan gözlemlenemeyen atomların varlığına dair şüpheci bir tutum sergilemişlerdir. Onların yaklaşımı, deneysel olarak doğrulanabilir bilgiye odaklanır ve o dönemde atomların varlığını kanıtlayacak araçlar ve teknolojiler henüz mevcut değildi. Bu nedenle, onlar doğrudan gözlem ve deneysel kanıtlar olmadan bir fenomenin varlığını kabul etmekte temkinliydiler. Buna karşılık, Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" adlı eserinde ele aldığı materyalist yaklaşımda, maddenin varlığı ve dünyanın materyal bir temele sahip olduğu önceden kabul edilir. Bu anlayış, Marksizm'de de görüldüğü gibi, tarihsel ve toplumsal analizlerle birleşen bir materyalizmdir. Marx'ın Doktora tezinde Demokritos ve Epikür gibi antik atomculardan bahsetmesi, materyalizmin bilim ve felsefe tarihindeki derin köklerini ve maddenin varlığına olan ilkesel bağlılığını gösterir. Doğa bilimciler ve sosyal bilimciler arasındaki bu \\"gerisine düşme\\" durumu, aslında bilimsel yöntemin ve bilginin doğasını anlamamızda önemli bir ders sunar. Doğa bilimcilerinin geçici şüpheciliği, bilimsel yöntemin bir parçasıdır; yani, yeni kanıtlar ortaya çıkana kadar varsayımları sorgulama eğilimi. Ancak, sosyal bilimcilerin ve materyalist felsefecilerin ileri sürdüğü gibi, derin teorik önkabuller ve genel ilkeler de bilimsel düşünce ve fikir gelişiminde rol oynar. Yani, bazı durumlarda, geniş çerçeveyi ve teorik temelleri göz önünde bulundurmak, henüz eksik olsa bile, deneysel kanıtların gelecekte bu teorik çerçeveleri nasıl destekleyeceğine dair önsezilere yol açabilir. Sonuç olarak, atomun varlığının kabul edilmesi, hem teorik olarak sağlam bir temele dayanan materyalist düşünceyi hem de deneysel kanıtların son derece önemli olduğu emprist yaklaşımı doğrular.

It instantiates a new GlideRecord object targeted at the \\"alm_hardware\\" table. Let's break it down: - **var alm =** This part declares a variable named \`alm\`. This variable will store the GlideRecord object that you're about to create. The \`var\` keyword is used for variable declaration in JavaScript, which is the scripting language used in ServiceNow. - **new GlideRecord(\\"alm_hardware\\");** This creates a new instance of the GlideRecord class, aimed at interacting with the \\"alm_hardware\\" table. The GlideRecord class is used to query, insert, update, and delete records in ServiceNow database tables. The argument \`\\"alm_hardware\\"\` specifies which table in the ServiceNow database the GlideRecord object should operate on. In this case, it's the hardware asset table, which typically stores records of physical assets like laptops, servers, phones, etc. Here's a brief outline of how you might use this \`alm\` variable to query the table for specific records: \`\`\`javascript var alm = new GlideRecord('alm_hardware'); alm.addQuery('status', 'In Use'); // Add a query to find records where the status is \\"In Use\\" alm.query(); // Execute the query on the database while (alm.next()) { // Iterate over the result set // For each record found, do something. For example, print the name of the asset. gs.info(alm.name); } \`\`\` In this example, \`alm.addQuery('status', 'In Use');\` adds a filter to the query, specifying that only records where the \`status\` field is \\"In Use\\" should be returned. \`alm.query();\` executes the query, and \`alm.next()\` iterates over each record found. Inside the loop, you can access fields of the records using \`alm.fieldname\`, where \`fieldname\` is the name of a column in the \\"alm_hardware\\" table. \`gs.info(alm.name);\` is an example of printing the name of each asset to the system log.

Pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile materyalizm ve naturalizm arasındaki bu çatışma, bilim ve felsefenin sınırları, yöntemleri ve temel varsayımları hakkında derin soruları gündeme getirmiştir. Mach'a karşı Lenin'in yazdığı \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" bu tartışmanın doruk noktalarından birini temsil eder. Mach ve Viyana çevresi gibi doğa bilimci empristler, dönemin bilim pratiğine uygun olarak, yalnızca doğrudan duyusal deneyimle doğrulanan bilgileri geçerli kabul ederken, Marx, Engels, Lenin gibi sosyal bilimci materyalistler, bilinmeyeni, gözlemlenemeyeni ve teorik olarak kavramsallaştırılanı da bilginin bir parçası olarak görmekteydi. Bu durum, doğa hakkındaki anlayışın atomun varlığı gibi konularda iki taraf arasında nasıl farklılaştığını aydınlatır. Bu farklılaşma, her iki tarafın da bilim ve bilgiye yaklaşımında temel felsefi önkabullere dayanır. Empristler, bilginin kökenini doğrudan deneyim ve gözlemlere bağlarken, materyalistler daha geniş bir ontolojik yapı içinde madde ve onun hareketini esas alırlar. Bu, materyalistlerin atom gibi kavramları teorik ön kabuller olarak kabul etmelerine ve bu teorik yapıyı sosyal ve ekonomik teorilerine uygulamalarına olanak tanır. Fizik ve diğer doğa bilimlerinde atomların varlığının kanıtlanmasıyla, doğa bilimci empristlerin teorik öngörülerin önemini ve bilgi üretiminde teorik çerçevelerin rolünü daha iyi anlamaları gerektiği ortaya çıktı. Ironik bir şekilde, sosyal bilim kökenli materyalistler, doğa bilimlerinin temel bir konusunda, doğrudan gözleme dayanmayan teorik bir yaklaşım kullanarak haklı çıktılar. Bu durum, bilimde teorik modellerin ve kavramların önemini vurgular. Deney ve gözlem, bilgi üretiminin önemli araçlarıdır, ancak bazı durumlarda, teorik çerçeveler gözlemle ulaşılamayan fenomenleri anlamamıza yardımcı olur. Doğa bilimleri ile sosyal bilimler arasındaki bu etkileşim, bilimi ve felsefeyi birbirinden tamamen ayrı disiplinler olarak değil, birbirleriyle iç içe geçmiş ve birbirlerinden öğrenen alanlar olarak görmemiz gerektiğini hatırlatır. Sonuç olarak, doğa bilimci empristler ile sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin bu karşılaşması, bilimde teori ile deneyimin birbirini tamamlayıcı olduklarını ve bilginin sınırlı ve tarihsel bir süreç içinde geliştiğini gösterir.

However, your current code snippet is missing a crucial line at the end: \`alm.update();\`. Without this line, the changes you make to the \`substatus\` field in the loop will not be saved back to the database. Here is the corrected version of your script: \`\`\`javascript var alm = new GlideRecord('alm_hardware'); // Fixed the quotation marks alm.addEncodedQuery('install_status=1^substatus!='); alm.query(); while (alm.next()) { alm.substatus = ''; alm.update(); // This line saves the change to the database } \`\`\` A few notes to ensure this script does exactly what you intend and to optimize it: 1. **Understanding \`addEncodedQuery\`**: The method \`addEncodedQuery\` allows you to add complex query conditions as a single string. In your script, \`'install_status=1^substatus!='\` effectively filters for records where the \`install_status\` is 1 and \`substatus\` is not empty. 2. **Clearing \`substatus\` and Updating**: Setting \`alm.substatus = '';\` changes the \`substatus\` to an empty string for the current record in the loop. Calling \`alm.update();\` immediately after ensures this change is written to the database. 3. **Performance Considerations**: Be cautious when using scripts that update records in a loop, especially on large tables. This can lead to performance issues. It's generally a good idea to test such scripts in a sub-production instance before running them in production. Additionally, consider whether all records matching the condition truly need their \`substatus\` cleared, as this could be a potentially wide-reaching action. 4. **Permissions and Auditing**: Make sure that the user account executing this script has the necessary permissions to update records in the \`alm_hardware\` table. Additionally, be aware that changes made through scripts will be recorded in audit logs (if auditing is enabled for the table), and the script might need to be documented as part of your change management process. Remember, making bulk changes directly to the database can have significant impacts, so always proceed with caution and ensure you have recent backups or a rollback plan."},{"prompt":"привет я запускаю свой удаленный сервер на убунту под root, а далее после всех манипуляций (стоит графическая оболочка ubuntu-desktop) меня выкидывает на окно авторизации и пароль который я вводил при подключении не подходит","completion":"Привет! Если вы столкнулись с проблемой, когда после установки графического интерфейса на удаленный сервер Ubuntu и после всех настроек вас выкидывает на окно авторизации, где не принимается введенный вами пароль, есть несколько способов попытаться решить эту проблему. 1. **Пересоздание пароля пользователя root (или вашего пользователя)**: - Сначала вам необходимо получить доступ к консоли сервера через SSH или через консоль веб-интерфейса вашего провайдера облачных услуг/хостинга. - Затем вы можете изменить пароль пользователя, выполнив команду \`passwd\` для пользователя root или \`passwd ваш_логин\`, если вы используете другой аккаунт. Вам будет предложено ввести новый пароль. 2. **Проверьте настройки PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)**: - Убедитесь, что в файле конфигурации PAM для графического окружения нет строгих ограничений, из-за которых авторизация может не пройти. Это можно проверить в файлах в директории \`/etc/pam.d/\`. Однако будьте осторожны, неправильные изменения в PAM могут привести к тому, что система станет полностью недоступной. 3. **Установите или переустановите графический менеджер входа**: - Если проблема связана непосредственно с окном авторизации, попробуйте переустановить или установить другой менеджер входа. Например, LightDM является популярным выбором для многих дистрибутивов Ubuntu: \`\`\` sudo apt-get install lightdm \`\`\` - При установке вам может быть предложено выбрать менеджер входа по умолчанию, убедитесь, что вы выбрали только что установленный. 4. **Проверьте журналы системы**: - Проверка системных логов также может помочь выявить причину проблемы. Файлы логов, которые могут содержать полезную информацию, включают \`/var/log/auth.log\` и \`/var/log/syslog\`. Ищите сообщения, которые появляются в момент попытки входа в систему. 5. **Вернитесь к консольному режиму**: - Если ничего из вышеперечисленного не помогло, возможно, стоит временно отказаться от использования графической оболочки и работать напрямую через консоль, чтобы выяснить, связана ли проблема именно с графическим интерфейсом или есть другие, более глубокие проблемы в системе. Обратите внимание, что работать под пользователем root для повседневных задач, включая использование графического интерфейса, не рекомендуется из-за потенциальных рисков для безопасности системы.

Vamos abordar algumas noções básicas de estatística e probabilidade aplicadas ao contexto das apostas esportivas. Entender esses conceitos pode ajudá-lo a fazer apostas mais informadas. # 1. Conceitos Básicos Probabilidade A probabilidade mede a chance de um evento acontecer. É normalmente expressa como uma fração ou porcentagem entre 0 e 1, onde 0 indica impossibilidade e 1 indica certeza. Valor Esperado Refere-se ao valor médio que você pode esperar ganhar ou perder por aposta, considerando as probabilidades e os possíveis resultados. É calculado como a soma dos produtos das probabilidades de cada resultado pelo valor de seus respectivos pagamentos. # 2. Aplicando na Aposta Esportiva Calculando Probabilidades Em apostas esportivas, as casas de apostas definem as probabilidades (odds), que refletem o quão provável é um evento ocorrer. No entanto, elas incluem uma margem de lucro, por isso é crucial entender como converter essas odds em probabilidades implícitas para verificar se uma aposta tem valor. Encontrar Valor Uma aposta tem **valor** quando a probabilidade de um evento, segundo a sua análise ou modelo, é maior que a probabilidade implícita pelas odds oferecidas. O cálculo é: [ text{Valor} = (text{Probabilidade estimada} times text{Odds}) - 1 ] Se o valor for positivo, a aposta tem valor esperado positivo segundo sua análise. Tipos de Odds - **Decimais:** Mais comuns na Europa, exceto no Reino Unido. O retorno total é calculado multiplicando a aposta pelo valor decimal mostrado. - **Fracionárias:** Tradicionais no Reino Unido. O numerador diz quanto você ganha apostando o valor do denominador. - **Americanas:** Indicam o favorito com um sinal negativo e o azarão com um sinal positivo. O número revela quanto você deve apostar para ganhar 100 ou quanto você ganha ao apostar 100. # 3. Gerenciamento de Risco Apostas Com Valor Concentre-se em apostas que, segundo sua análise, ofereçam valor positivo a longo prazo, ao invés de buscar ganhos imediatos. Kelly Criterion O critério de Kelly pode ser usado para determinar o tamanho ótimo de uma aposta, maximizando o crescimento do seu banco de apostas. É importante ajustar as apostas ao tamanho do seu banco para evitar a falência. Diversificação Não coloque todas as suas reservas em uma única aposta. Espalhar suas apostas em vários eventos pode ajudar a reduzir o risco. # 4. Conclusão As apostas esportivas exigem uma compreensão sólida de estatística e probabilidade para serem bem-sucedidas a longo prazo. A análise cuidadosa, a gestão de risco e uma abordagem disciplinada podem aumentar suas chances de sucesso. Lembre-se de que, independentemente do quão boas sejam suas análises, sempre existe o elemento de incerteza nas apostas esportivas, então aposte de forma responsável."},{"prompt":"Calculando Probabilidades para entender como converter odds em probabilidades implícitas para verificar se uma aposta tem valor.","completion":"Calcular a probabilidade implícita a partir das odds oferecidas pelas casas de apostas é uma habilidade crucial para qualquer apostador. Isso permite avaliar se há valor em uma aposta, comparando a probabilidade implícita com a sua avaliação da probabilidade real do evento. A seguir, mostrarei como converter diferentes tipos de odds (decimais, fracionárias e americanas) em probabilidades implícitas. # 1. Odds Decimais Este tipo de odd é comum na Europa e bastante direto de se converter em probabilidade implícita. As odds decimais refletem o valor total que será devolvido por cada unidade apostada, incluindo a própria aposta. A fórmula para converter odds decimais em probabilidade implícita é: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{1}{text{Odds Decimais}} times 100 ] Por exemplo, se as odds são 2.00: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{1}{2.00} times 100 = 50% ] Isso significa que, segundo a casa de apostas, o evento tem 50% de chance de acontecer. # 2. Odds Fracionárias Muito comuns no Reino Unido, as odds fracionárias mostram o lucro potencial em relação à aposta. Para converter odds fracionárias em probabilidade implícita, você pode usar a fórmula: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{text{Denominador}}{text{Denominador} + text{Numerador}} times 100 ] Se as odds fracionárias são 1/1 (evens): [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{1}{1 + 1} times 100 = 50% ] # 3. Odds Americanas As odds americanas podem ser positivas ou negativas. Para odds positivas, a fórmula é: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{100}{text{Odds Americanas Positivas} + 100} times 100 ] Para odds negativas: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{text{Odds Americanas Negativas}}{text{Odds Americanas Negativas} - 100} times 100 ] Suponha que você tenha odds americanas de +200: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{100}{200 + 100} times 100 = 33.33% ] E para odds de -200: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{200}{200 - 100} times 100 = 66.67% ] # Verificando Valor da Aposta Após calcular a probabilidade implícita, compare-a com a sua avaliação da probabilidade real do evento. Se acredita que a chance do evento é maior do que a probabilidade implícita sugere, então a aposta tem valor esperado positivo. Por exemplo, se calculou que um time tem 60% de chance de vencer, mas as odds correspondem a uma probabilidade implícita de apenas 50%, isso indica uma aposta de bom valor. Lembre-se de que esses cálculos são baseados nas margens incluídas pelas casas de apostas, então sempre existe um elemento de risco. Avaliar corretamente eventos esportivos exige conhecimento e experiência."},{"prompt":"explique detalhado como Calcular Probabilidades para entender como converter odds em probabilidades implícitas para verificar se uma aposta tem valor.","completion":"Vou detalhar o processo de calcular probabilidades implícitas das odds e como você pode usar essas informações para determinar se uma aposta tem valor. Esse processo é fundamental para qualquer apostador que deseja tomar decisões informadas e melhorar suas chances de sucesso a longo prazo. # Passo 1: Entenda o que são Odds As \\"odds\\" (probabilidades) são a representação numérica da chance estimada de um determinado resultado em uma aposta esportiva. Existem três tipos principais de odds: decimais, fracionárias e americanas (positivas e negativas). # Passo 2: Converta Odds em Probabilidades Implícitas A probabilidade implícita é uma conversão das odds oferecidas pelas casas de apostas em uma porcentagem que reflete a chance estimada de ocorrência de um determinado evento. Aqui está como converter cada tipo de odd em probabilidade implícita: Odds Decimais [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} (%) = frac{1}{text{Odds Decimais}} times 100 ] Exemplo: Odds = 3.0 [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{1}{3.0} times 100 = 33.33% ] Odds Fracionárias [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} (%) = frac{text{Denominador}}{text{Denominador} + text{Numerador}} times 100 ] Exemplo: Odds = 1/2 (um para dois) [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{2}{2 + 1} times 100 = 66.67% ] Odds Americanas Para odds positivas: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} (%) = frac{100}{text{Odds Americanas} + 100} times 100 ] Exemplo: Odds = +200 [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{100}{200 + 100} times 100 = 33.33% ] Para odds negativas: [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} (%) = frac{text{Abs(Odds Americanas)}}{text{Abs(Odds Americanas)} + 100} times 100 ] Exemplo: Odds = -150 [ text{Probabilidade Implícita} = frac{150}{150 + 100} times 100 = 60% ] # Passo 3: Determine se uma Aposta Tem Valor Depois de calcular a probabilidade implícita, você precisa compará-la com sua própria estimativa da probabilidade real do evento. Se a sua probabilidade estimada é maior do que a probabilidade implícita, a aposta tem valor esperado positivo. Exemplo de Avaliação de Valor Digamos que você avalia que uma equipe tem 70% de chance de ganhar uma partida, mas as odds implícitas da casa de apostas sugerem uma probabilidade de 60%. - Probabilidade estimada: 70% - Probabilidade implícita das odds: 60% Neste caso, a sua avaliação sugere que a equipe tem chances maiores de ganhar do que as odds implicam, o que indica que a aposta tem valor. # Conclusão Calcular a probabilidade implícita e compará-la com suas próprias estimativas de probabilidade permite identificar apostas com valor positivo. Este é um conceito chave para apostadores que buscam lucratividade a longo prazo, pois enfatiza a importância da análise e do conhecimento em detrimento da sorte. Lembre-se de que, mesmo com uma análise meticulosa, o resultado nunca é garantido, e o jogo responsável deve sempre ser uma prioridade."},{"prompt":"Doğa bilimleri kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve duyumdışı her türden metafiziğe karşı kuşkucu olan ve duyumları esas alan pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile sosyal bilim kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair duyumları aşan bir apriori önkabulü, inancı, hatta imanı esas alan materyalizm ve naturalizmin karşılaşmasında, özellikle Mach’a karşı Lenin’in yazdığı Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm kitabı bağlamında ortaya çıkan bu karşılaşmada; emprist taraf fizikte gözlem imkanları yetersiz olduğu için atomların varlığına bile şüpheyle bakarken materyalist taraf Demokritos ve Epikür’e kadar uzanan uzak bir geçmişte bile atomu teorik bir önkabul olarak var kabul ediyordu, ki Marx’ın doktora tezi bu iki atomcu filozof hakkındaydı; nasıl oldu da fizik gibi bir doğa biliminde, doğa bilimci empristler (Mach ve Viyana çevresi felsefecileri) sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx dışında felsefe eğitimi almamış amatörler Engels, Lenin vb.) gerisine düşebildirler? Sonuçta, doğa hakkında haklı çıkan taraf sosyal bilimci materyalistler oldu. Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte doğa bilimci empristler 2300 senelik bir gecikmeyle de olsa (Demokritos’un ölümü MÖ 370) atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","completion":"Bu karşılaştırmanın çekişmeli doğası, felsefe ve bilim tarihindeki en temel tartışmalardan birini yansıtmaktadır: metafiziğin bilimdeki yeri ve duyum üzerine kurulu epistemoloji ile maddenin varlığı üzerinde kurulu ontoloji arasındaki gerilim. Bir yanda doğa bilimleri kökenli felsefeciler ve diğer yanda sosyal bilim kökenli felsefeciler bulunmaktadır. Doğa bilimlerinden gelen empristler (örneğin, Ernst Mach ve Viyana Çevresi) duyumlar ve gözlem verilerine sıkı sıkıya bağlı kaldılar ve duyumsamadan öteye geçen her türlü metafiziği reddettiler. Duyumsanamayanın (örneğin, atomların varlığı gibi) bilimsel açıklamalarda yer almasına şüpheyle yaklaştılar. Sosyal bilimler kökenli materyalistler ise, var olan her şeyin maddi temellere dayandığı görüşünü savundular ve duyumların ötesinde var olan bir gerçekliğin kabul edilmesi gerektiğine inandılar. Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Empiriyokritisizm\\" kitabı, bu konuda en önemli savunulardan birini temsil eder. Lenin bu eserde, Mach'ın ve benzeri düşünürlerin pozisyonlarını eleştirerek, bilimin ve filozofinin maddi gerçekliği kabul etmesi gerektiğini savunur. Lenin’e göre, bilim ve felsefe, duyuların ötesindeki gerçeklikler hakkında bilgi edinebilir ve bu, özellikle materyalist felsefe tarafından yüzyıllar boyunca savunulan bir pozisyondur. Bu karşılaşmanın ilginç yanlarından biri, doğrudan doğa bilimleriyle uğraşan kişilerin, sosyal bilimci materyalist felsefecilerin varsayımlarına karşı çıkan bir pozisyona sahip olmalarıdır. Ancak, zaman geçtikçe ve özellikle 20. yüzyılda fizik alanındaki gelişmelerle (özellikle kuantum mekaniği ve atom teorisi alanında), doğa bilimleri kökenli empristlerin varsayımları sorgulanmaya başlanmış ve atomun gerçekliği genel kabul görmüştür. Bu da sosyal bilim kökenli materyalistlerin -en azından bu konuda- doğru olduğunu göstermiştir. Sonuç olarak, bu durum bilim ve felsefenin doğasını göstermektedir: Bilgi ve anlayışımızın gelişiminde esas olan şeyler sıkça tartışmalıdır ve doğru kabul edilen bir görüşün zamanla değişebileceğini, yeni bulgular ve teorilerle yerini başka bir anlayışa bırakabileceğini unutmamak gerekir. Bu durum, bilim ve felsefenin dinamik ve sürekli gelişen yapısının bir göstergesidir."},{"prompt":"Лекция по экологии. Тема: «Экстремальная погода, пути решения» Климатический хаос В последние годы климат на Земле заметно меняется: одни страны стра-дают от аномальной жары, другие от слишком суровых и снежных зим, непривычных для этих мест. Экологи говорят о глобальном изменении климата, включающем увели-чение средней годовой температуры, вызывающей таяние ледников, и повышение уровня Мирового океана. Помимо потепления, происходит также разбалансировка всех природных систем, которая приводит к изменению режима выпадения осадков, температурным аномалиям и увеличению час-тоты экстремальных явлений, таких как ураганы, наводнения и засухи. По данным ученых, за десять месяцев 2015 года средняя температура планеты оказалась на 1,02 °C выше той, которую фиксировали в XIX веке с началом наблюдения за изменениями глобальной температуры. Порог в один градус был превышен впервые в современной истории. Ученые сходятся во мнении, что именно деятельность человека - сжигание нефти, газа и угля – приводит к парниковому эффекту, который вызывает повышение средней температуры. Эксперты отмечают, что в период между 2000 и 2010 годами наблюдался самый мощный рост выбросов парниковых газов за последние 30 лет. По данным Всемирной метеорологической организации, в 2014 году их концентрация в атмосфере достигла рекордно высокого уровня. Если государства не начнут всерьез заниматься проблемой охраны окружающей среды, к 2100 году температура на планете может подняться на 3,7-4,8 °С. Климатологи предупреждают: необратимые последствия для экологии наступят уже при потеплении более чем на 2 °С. Природные катаклизмы Климатические пояса сдвинутся, изменения погоды станут более резки-ми (сильные морозы, сменяющиеся внезапными оттепелями зимой, рост чис-ла аномально жарких дней летом). Увеличится частота и сила аномальных яв-лений, таких как засухи и наводнения. Связь между изменением климата и возникновением стихийных бедст-вий доказали американские ученые, которые обнаружили следы потепления при изучении тропических циклонов в Тихом океане, необычно высоких лет-них температур в Европе, Китае, Южной Корее и Аргентине, а также лесных пожаров в американском штате Калифорния. Климатические изменения по-служили также катализатором засухи в Африке и на Ближнем Востоке, снеж-ных бурь в Непале и проливных ливней, вызвавших наводнения в Канаде и Новой Зеландии. Непригодные для жизни территории Некоторые страны из-за повышения влажности и высокой средней тем-пературы к 2100 году могут стать непригодными для жизни. Согласно иссле-дованию американских ученых, в группу риска попадают Катар, Саудовская Аравия, Бахрейн, ОАЭ и другие страны Ближнего Востока. По расчетам климатологов, при текущем темпе роста выбросов парни-ковых газов уже к 2070 году средняя температура воздуха в странах Персид-ского залива может составить 74-77 °С. Это сделает территории непригод-ными для людей. Исключение могут составить крупные мегаполисы с разви-той системой кондиционирования. Но и в них люди смогут выходить из дома лишь по ночам. Удар по биологическому разнообразию По мнению некоторых ученых, мы находимся в середине шестого по счету в истории Земли массового вымирания видов. И на этот раз данный про-цесс вызван действиями человека. Если потепление климата не остановить, многие экосистемы, виды живых существ, которые в них входят, станут менее разнообразными, менее насыщенными. Существуют прогнозы исчезновения до 30-40% видов растений и живот-ных, поскольку их среда обитания будет изменяться быстрее, чем они смогут приспособиться к этим изменениям. Нехватка питьевой воды, голод и эпидемии Эксперты ООН предупреждают, что потепление отрицательно скажет-ся на урожайности, особенно в слаборазвитых странах Африки, Азии и Латин-ской Америки, что приведет к продовольственным проблемам. По данным ученых, к 2080 году число людей, сталкивающихся с угрозой го-лода, может увеличиться на 600 млн человек. Другим важным последствием климатических изменений может стать нехватка питьевой воды. В регионах с засушливым климатом (Центральная Азия, Средиземноморье, Южная Африка, Австралия и т. п.) ситуация еще более усугубится из-за сокращения количества осадков. Голод, нехватка воды, а также миграция насекомых может привести к увеличению эпидемий и распространению в северных районах таких тропи-ческих болезней как малярия и лихорадка. Изменения климата могут коснуться не только здоровья людей, но так-же повысить риск политических разногласий и конфликтов за доступ к вод-ным и продовольственным ресурсам. Повышение уровня мирового океана Одним из самых ощутимых следствий потепления климата, по всей ви-димости, станет таяние ледников и повышение уровня Мирового океана. Мил-лионы людей на побережье погибнут от частых наводнений или будут вынуждены переселиться, предсказывают аналитики ООН. По мнению экспертного сообщества, повышение уровня моря в XXI ве-ке составит до 1 м (в ХХ веке - 0,1-0,2 м). В этом случае наиболее уязвимыми окажутся низменности, прибрежные территории и небольшие острова. Первыми в зону риска попадают Нидерланды, Бангладеш и малые островные государства, такие как Багамы, Мальдивы. Значительные территории могут быть затоплены в таких странах, как Россия, США, Великобритания, Италия, Германия, Дания, Бельгия, Ирак, Таи-ланд и Вьетнам. Серьезный ущерб грозит Китаю, где около 140 млн человек могут лишиться крова, и Японии, где может затопить дома более 30 млн человек - четвертой части населения страны. Предполагаемые последствия для РФ Климат в России также заметно меняется. Чаще наблюдаются резкие из-менения погоды, аномально высокие и аномально низкие температуры. По данным Минприроды РФ, в нашей стране с 1990 по 2010 год коли-чество природных катастроф, таких как паводки, наводнения, сели и ураганы, возросло почти в четыре раза и продолжает увеличиваться примерно на 6-7% в год. Экологи предсказывают, что в течение следующих десяти лет их число может удвоиться. По оценке Всемирного банка, ежегодный ущерб от воздействия опас-ных гидрометеорологических явлений на территории России составляет 30-60 млрд рублей. По расчетам Росгидромета, в России средняя годовая температура рас-тет в 2,5 раза быстрее, чем во всем мире. Наиболее активно потепление идет в северных районах РФ, добавляют в МЧС. Так, в Арктике к концу XXI века температура может вырасти на 7 °С. Уже к середине XXI века средняя темпе-ратура зимой на всей территории России может увеличиться на 2-5 °С. Повы-шение летних температур будет менее выраженным и составит 1-3 °C к сере-дине столетия, полагают спасатели. Угрозы, связанные с потеплением: — рост повторяемости, интенсивности и продолжительности засух в одних регионах, экстремальных осадков, наводнений, случаев опасного для сельского хозяйства переувлажнения почвы - в других; — повышение пожароопасности в лесах и на торфяниках; — нарушение привычного образа жизни коренных северных народов; — деградация вечной мерзлоты с ущербом для строений и коммуни-каций; — нарушение экологического равновесия, вытеснение одних биологи-ческих видов другими; — увеличение расходов электроэнергии на кондиционирование возду-ха в летний сезон для значительной территории страны. Положительные изменения: — потепление в Арктике увеличит продолжительность навигации по Северному морскому пути и облегчит освоение нефтегазовых месторождений на шельфе; — сократится отопительный сезон, и, соответственно, снизится расход энергии; — северная граница земледелия сместится на север, благодаря чему вы-растет площадь сельскохозяйственных угодий, особенно в Западной Сибири и на Урале. Что делать По мнению ученых, полностью предотвратить изменения климата чело-вечеству вряд ли удастся. Однако международное сообщество способно сдержать рост температуры, чтобы избежать необратимых последствий эко-логии. Для этого необходимо ограничить выбросы парниковых газов, разви-вать альтернативную энергетику и разработать стратегию снижения рисков из-за потепления. Адаптация жизни общества к новым условиям Планы по минимизации ущерба от изменения климата, должны охва-тить все сферы деятельности человека, в том числе здравоохранение, сельское хозяйство и инфраструктуру. В России, например, нужно менять ливневую канализацию, готовиться к штормовым ветрам (пересчитывать прочность конструкций), изменять сис-тему пожаротушения - засухи повышают пожарную опасность. В Киргизии поднялась снеговая граница в Тянь-Шане, это вызвало проблемы с выпасом скота - нужно принимать меры к сохранению пастбищ. Однако у разных государств разные возможности нивелировать влия-ние изменения климата. Так, например, Голландия и Бангладеш испытывают одинаковые проблемы: стало больше штормов, повысился уровень океана. Но в Голландии уже есть план действий, они знают, как будут усиливать дамбы, откуда возьмут средства. А в Бангладеш ничего этого нет, причем в 10 раз больше береговая линия и в 10 раз больше население, и на опасных террито-риях проживают 100 млн человек, которых нужно будет куда-то переселить. Сокращение выбросов парниковых газов По оценкам климатологов, чтобы удержать рост температуры в преде-лах до 2 °C, странам необходимо к 2050 году вполовину снизить глобальные выбросы по отношению к уровню 1990 года, а к концу XXI века - сократить до нуля. По данным аналитиков PwC, с 2000 года Россия в среднем снижала выб-росы углекислого газа на 3,6% в год, Великобритания - на 3,3%, Франция - на 2,7%, США - на 2,3%. Среднегодовое снижение углеродных выбросов за последние 15 лет составило 1,3%. Чтобы предотвратить необратимые изменения климата, ежегодное сни-жение выбросов углекислого газа вплоть до 2100 года должно составлять не менее 6,3%. Это значит, с одной стороны, нужно внедрять энергосберегающие тех-нологии, с другой - переходить на альтернативные источники энергии. Устанавливая квоты на вредные выбросы, используя другие, по своему характеру тактические меры, мы на какой-то срок снимем остроту проблемы, но кардинально ее не решим. Нам нужны качественно иные подходы. Речь должна идти о внедрении принципиально новых технологий, которые не наносят урон окружающему миру, а существуют с ним в гармонии. Солнце или атом Безопасными для атмосферы с точки зрения выбросов являются: гидро-энергетика, атомные станции и новые возобновляемые источники - солнце, ветер, приливы и отливы. Гидроэнергетика имеет обозримые физически пределы (рек на Земле не так много), ветер и приливы могут использоваться лишь локально, поэтому главные источники энергии будущего - это Солнце и атом. Исходя из нынешнего уровня развития технологий, атомная энергетика выглядит более солидно: на долю альтернативных возобновляемых источни-ков энергии сейчас приходится 2% мирового потребления, а атом уже дает 16% электроэнергии мира (в развитых странах - больше 70%, на северо-запа-де России - 40%). Достоинство атомной энергетики в том, что это крупная энергетика, это электростанции для крупных промышленных агломераций, крупных городов. Козырь солнечной энергетики - почти повсеместная доступность и дина-мичное развитие технологий. Кроме того, солнечная энергетика совер-шенствуется и может стать значительно более экономичной, в отличие от ядерной энергетики, которую уже не удастся значительно удешевить. Полностью решить проблему сокращения выбросов парниковых газов за счет возобновляемых источников энергии нельзя. Обеспечить промышлен-ность энергией с помощью солнечных батарей (гелиоэнергетика) в северных странах, таких как Россия, где полгода на севере солнце есть, полгода - нет, невозможно. Ветроэнергетика тоже годится для индивидуального потребления, но не для промышленного производства. Ветряки применяются во многих регио-нах, в основном в прибрежных районах, однако сплошного покрытия территории ими нет. В России примерно треть энергетики основана не на минеральном сырье, а на атомной и гидроэнергетике. Кто заплатит Переговоры о противодействии изменениям климата осложняются раз-ногласиями между богатыми и бедными странами. Переход на экологически чистые источники энергии требует значитель-ных затрат. Развитые страны настаивают, чтобы вклад в эти усилия вносили все участники переговоров. В свою очередь развивающиеся страны считают, что ответственность за изменение климата несут индустриальные державы, которые уже давно загрязняют атмосферу парниовыми газами. По мнению генерального секретаря ООН Пан Ги Муна, особая ответ-ственность в борьбе с изменением климата и последствиями этого явления ле-жит на развитых странах. В 2010 году для помощи развивающимся странам под эгидой ООН создан \\"Зеленый климатический фонд\\" (Green Climate Fund). Средства выделяются большей частью развитыми государствами. Планируется, что к 2020 году объем фонда должен составить 100 млрд, однако пока в нем чуть более 10 млрд. Сейчас развитые страны испытывают серьезную нагрузку на госбюдже-ты, поэтому предпочитают, чтобы климатическое финансирование шло через частные инвестиции или кредиты и займы. Уязвимые же страны брать кредиты не готовы. Несмотря на то, что Россия не имеет обязательств по внесению средств в \\"Зеленый климатический фонд\\", Москва готова на добровольной основе его поддерживать, в первую очередь это касается стран СНГ. В ноябре 2015 года фонд одобрил выделение 168 млн на первые восемь проектов помощи развивающимся странам в адаптации к негативным последствиям изменения климата. Речь идет о трех проектах в Африке, трех - в Азиатско-Тихоокеанском регионе и двух - в Латинской Америке. 12 декабря 2015 года на Всемирной конференции ООН по климату в Париже 195 делегаций со всего мира одобрили глобальное соглашение, кото-рое должно прийти на смену Киотскому протоколу, срок действия которого заканчивается в 2020 году. 22 апреля 2016 года 175 стран подписали договор по климату. Соглашение вступит в силу после того, как оно будет ратифицировано 55 странами, на которые приходится по крайней мере 55% от общего объема глобальных выбросов парниковых газов. Главная цель нового договора, которую подтвердили все страны-участ-ницы, - добиться значительного снижения выбросов парниковых газов и тем самым удержать повышение средней температуры на планете в пределах 1,5-2 °C. Так, уровень совокупных выбросов рискует достигнуть отметки в 55 ги-гатонн в 2030 году, в то время как, по подсчетам экспертов ООН, эта максимальная отметка должна составить не более 40 гигатонн. Участники соглашения обязуются: • принять национальные планы по снижению выбросов, технологи-ческому перевооружению и адаптации к климатическим изменениям; данные обязательства государства должны пересматривать в сторону усиления каж-дые пять лет; • планомерно снижать выбросы CO2 в атмосферу; для этого к 2020 го-ду необходимо разработать национальные стратегии перехода на безуглерод-ную экономику; • ежегодно выделять в Зеленый климатический фонд 100 млрд для помощи слаборазвитым и наиболее уязвимым странам. После 2025 года эта сумма должна быть пересмотрена в сторону увеличения \\"с учетом потреб-ностей и приоритетов развивающихся стран\\"; • наладить международный обмен \\"зелеными\\" технологиями в сфере энергоэффективности, промышленности, строительства, сельского хозяйства и т. д. На момент завершения саммита предварительные планы по сокращению эмиссий парниковых газов представили 189 государств. Пять стран, на долю которых приходится наибольший объем выбросов, предоставили следующие цифры по их снижению по отношению к 1990 году: • Евросоюз - 40%; • Россия - 30%; • США - 12-14%; • Китай - 6-18%; • Япония - 13%. Парниковый эффект: причины и последствия Парниковый эффект — это не катаклизм. Благодаря ему на земле живут все живые организмы, включая человека. Другое дело, что чрезмерность этого процесса, выход за допустимые пределы становится угрозой для всего живого на планете Земля. Поэтому и нужно понять, каким образом он может нести угрозу, и как ее избежать. Благодаря парниковому эффекту планета Земля является комфортным местом для жизни. Газы в атмосфере, такие как углекислый газ, называют парниковыми газами. Они и задерживают тепло, которое выпускается земной поверхностью. Без них планета остывала бы существенно быстрее, из-за чего она была непригодна для жизни человека. Во многом причины парникового эффекта обусловлены как деятель-ностью человека, так и животных. Источником того же метана, который попа-дает в атмосферу, во многом является крупный и мелкий рогатый скот. Непосредственная деятельность человека привела к глобальному увеличению температуры на 0,5% за последние 150 лет. Достаточно, чтобы глобальная температура на планете увеличилась на 3-5%, чтобы запустились разрушительные и деструктивные процессы. Их результатом может стать исчезновение человеческой цивилизации. Основные причины увеличения парникового эффекта, которые зависят непосредственно от деятельности человека: 1. Сжигание ископаемого топлива Ископаемые виды топлива, такие как уголь, нефть и природный газ широко используются для производства электроэнергии и для транспорти-ровки. Когда работают автомобили, они выделяют углекислый газ, который в основном и несет ответственность за усиление парникового эффекта. 2. Вырубка лесов Леса составляют большую зеленую зону на планете. Растения и деревья поглощают углекислый газ и выделяют кислород в процессе фотосинтеза, который необходим людям и животным для выживания. Крупномасштабное промышленное развитие привело к вырубке деревьев и лесов, что заставило людей искать альтернативные места для жизни. 3. Увеличение населения В течение последних нескольких десятилетий наблюдался огром-ный рост населения. Теперь это привело к увеличению спроса на продукты питания, одежду и жилье. Новые производственные центры появились в городах и поселках, которые выделяют в атмосферу вредные газы, что усиливает парниковый эффект. Кроме того, чем больше людей, тем больше использование ископаемого топлива, что, в свою очередь, усугубило проблему. 4. Сельское хозяйство Окись азота является парниковым газом, который используется в удоб-рениях и способствует парниковому эффекту, что, в свою очередь, приводит к глобальному потеплению. 5. Промышленные отходы и свалки Отрасли, которые занимаются производством цемента, удобрениями, добычей угля, добычей нефти, производят вредные парниковые газы. Кроме того, на свалках, заполненных мусором, образуются углекислый газ и метан, что в значительной степени способствует парниковому эффекту. Последствия парникового эффекта 1. Таяние ледниковых масс Из-за этого уменьшается процент солнечного излучения, отражаемого или возвращаемого земной поверхностью в атмосферу. Кроме того, отмеча-ется глобальное повышение уровня моря и выброс больших метановых стол-бов. 2. Затопление островов и прибрежных городов В докладе Межправительственной группы экспертов по изменению кли-мата (МГЭИК, 2014 г.), в период 1901-2010 гг. указывалось, что средний мировой уровень моря поднялся на 19 см. Предполагается, что к 2100 году уровень моря будет на 15–90 см выше, чем сейчас, под угрозой окажутся 92 миллиона человек. 3. Усиление ураганов Ураганы будут более многочисленными и разрушительными. Усиление парникового эффекта не вызывает этих экстремальных климатических явле-ний, но увеличивает их интенсивность. Ураганы связаны с температурой мо-ря – они образуются только над водами с температурой не менее 26,510C. 4. Миграция видов Многие виды животных будут вынуждены мигрировать, чтобы пере-жить изменения в основных климатических зонах, вызванных постепенным повышением температуры. Людям также придется переехать: согласно данным Всемирного банка, к 2050 году число людей, вынужденных покинуть свои дома из-за сильных засух или сильных наводнений, может достичь 140 миллионов человек. 5. Опустынивание плодородных районов Глобальное потепление оказывает глубокое воздействие на процессы деградации почв и способствует опустыниванию земель в наиболее засушли-вых районов на планете. Опустынивание уничтожает весь биологический по-тенциал пострадавших районов, превращая их в бесплодную и непродуктив-ную землю. Как было признано ООН по случаю Всемирного дня борьбы с опустыниванием в 2018 году, 30% земель деградировали и потеряли свою ре-альную ценность. 6. Воздействие на сельское хозяйство и животноводство Глобальное потепление уже изменило продолжительность вегетацион-ного периода на большей части планеты. Аналогичным образом, изменения температуры и времени года влияют на распространение насекомых, инва-зивных сорняков и болезней, которые могут повлиять на урожай. То же самое происходит со скотом: климатические изменения напря-мую влияют на важные виды по-разному – размножение, обмен веществ, болезни и т.п. Пути решения парникового эффекта Сокращение выбросов так называемых парниковых газов, таких как CO2 или CH4 (метан), – не единственное решение для ограничения парниково-го эффекта. Международные организации дают следующие рекомендации: 1. Применять преимущественно возобновляемую энергию; 2. Использовать общественный транспорт и другие экологически чис-тые средства, такие как электромобили или велосипеды; 3. Повышать экологическую самосознательность среди граждан и раз-личных администраций; 4. Внедрять обязательную утилизацию и массовое использование втор-сырья; 5. Уменьшать потребление мяса, заменяя его органическими продукта-ми. Несмотря на то, что основной причиной развития парникового эффекта на земле являются разные виды жизнедеятельности, не только человека, имен-но он может непосредственно повлиять на проблему. Это то, что отличает его от остальных видов. А значит, безопасное будущее планеты в его руках. Изменение климата и здоровье: последствия и риски МАТ Влияние на общественное здоровье Изменения качества воздуха в результате изменения климата могут по-влиять на физическое и психическое здоровье человека. Экстремальные погодные и температурные явления, повышенное за-грязнение окружающей среды, а также изменения в продовольственной без-опасности могут вызвать проблемы с физическим и психическим здоровьем. На что конкретно влияет изменения климата: • на безопасность жилища; • на качество воздуха, вдыхаемое человеком; • на качество, безопасность и снабжение питьевой водой; • на наличие еды. По данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения (ВОЗ), исследова-тели прогнозируют, что последствия изменения климата будут отображены примерно в 250 000 смертей в год в период с 2030 по 2050 год от таких болезней или состояний, как: • перегрев • недоедание (голод) • понос • малярия Изменение климата также способствует миграции, поскольку такие фак-торы, как засуха и резкое сокращение рыбных запасов, могут привести к тому, что сельское население переместится в городские центры. Проживание в городских районах может увеличить риск заболеваний из-за переполненности и более высоких температур. Психическое здоровье Чрезвычайная погодные условия и провоцируемые ними стихийные бед-ствия могут быть травмирующими и стрессовыми для людей. Люди подвергнутся травмам, потере своего дома и имущества или по-тере близких. Экстремальная жара также оказывает значительное влияние на людей с психическими расстройствами. По данным Центров по контролю и профи-лактике заболеваний, уровень самоубийств увеличивается с повышением температуры. Изменение климата и более высокие температуры оказывают негатив-ное влияние на депрессию и другие состояния психического здоровья. Экстремальные температуры также могут изменить работу некоторых лекарственных препаратов при лечение шизофрении. Кроме того, высокая температура влияет на способность людей правильно регулировать темпе-ратуру своего тела. Исследователи обнаружили, что стихийные бедствия, такие как ураган Катрина, оказывают негативное воздействие на психическое здоровье тех, кто в них вовлечен, включая посттравматическое стрессовое расстройство и высокий уровень тревоги. Опасения по поводу последствий изменения климата могут также стать источником повышенной тревоги или отчаяния для некоторых людей. Инфекционные заболевания По данным ВОЗ , изменение климата может вызвать рост инфекций, пе-редаваемых насекомыми, и заболеваний, передаваемых через воду. Причина этого заключается в том, что изменения климата могут уве-личить продолжительность сезонов, в течение которых насекомые передают инфекции. Эти изменения могут также расширить область, в которой они происходят. Изменения в характере осадков также увеличивает риск заболеваний, передающихся через воду, и инфекционных заболеваний, вызывающих диа-рею. Тепло и погодные условия Повышение температуры может вызвать или усугубить широкий спектр серьезных проблем со здоровьем. Длительное воздействие сильной жары может привести к: • тепловому удару; • мышечным судорогам; • ухудшения существующих условий, таких как респираторные и сердечные заболевания; • смерть. Экстремальные изменения температуры оказывают существенное влияние на определенные группы людей: • дети; • пожилые люди; • люди с хроническими заболеваниями; • люди с меньшей экономической стабильностью; • люди, которые социально изолированы; • живущих в городских районах, где уровень тепла будет на нес-колько градусов выше, чем в районах с меньшим количеством зданий. Увеличение экстремальных погодных условий представляет серь-езный риск для здоровья. Жаркие, сухие условия и засухи могут вызвать: • песчаную бурю; • лесные пожары; • снижение водоснабжения и качества воды; • пониженное качество воздуха; • недостаток еды. Все эти факторы могут иметь серьезные последствия для здоровья человека, в том числе: • повышенный риск инфекций; • травмирование; • ожоги; • проблемы с дыханием от воздействия дыма; • недоедание; • смерть. Загрязнение воздуха Увеличение степени загрязнения воздуха может представлять высокий риск для здоровья. Более высокий уровень пыли, озона и мелких частиц в воздухе может снизить качество воздуха и вызвать или усугубить целый ряд проблем со здоровьем, включая: • астму; • хроническую обструктивную болезнь легких (ХОБЛ); • кашель и раздражение горла; • воспаление легких; • риск рака легких; • перегрузку дыхательных путей; • грудную боль; • сердечные приступы. Аллергены Более высокие температуры могут привести к увеличению производ-ства пыльцы. Увеличение углекислого газа может привести к повышению уровня аллергенов из растений. В результате люди могут испытывать следующие эффекты: • большую чувствительность к аллергенам; • астму, включая частые приступы острой астмы; • ухудшение других респираторных заболеваний. Сочетание теплой погоды и большего количества осадков может при-вести к повышенной влажности и грибкам, в том числе плесени, в поме-щении. Эти условия также могут вызвать проблемы с дыханием. Продовольственная безопасность Изменения погоды влияют на урожай и производство продуктов пита-ния. Цены на продукты питания могут возрасти, что может привести к тому, что люди будут питаться продуктами плохого качества. Плохое питание мо-жет привести к голоду, недоеданию или ожирению. Пищевая ценность определенных продуктов может уменьшиться из-за изменения климата. Эксперты прогнозируют, что повышение уровня угле-кислого газа в атмосфере и изменение питательных веществ в почве приведет к уменьшению количества питательных веществ во многих культурах. Вероятное увеличение количества сорняков и вредителей также будет означать, что фермерам необходимо использовать большее количество герби-цидов и пестицидов. Эти вещества могут быть токсичными для людей, рабо-тающих с сельскохозяйственными культурами, а также для тех, кто их упот-ребляет. После десятилетий спада недавнее ухудшение состояния продоволь-ственной безопасности обусловлено конфликтами, замедлением экономи-ческого роста, изменчивостью климата и экстремальными погодными яв-лениями. В 2020 году более 50 миллионов человек пострадали вдвойне — от стихийных бедствий, связанных с климатом (наводнения, засухи и штормы), и от пандемии COVID-19. Почти 690 миллионов человек, или 9% населения мира, недоедали, и около 750 миллионов, или почти 10%, подверглись серьезному уровню отсутствия продовольственной безопасности в 2019 году. По прогнозам, отсутствие продовольственной безопасности ухудшится к 2030 году. Мобильность человека и перемещение Беженцы, внутренне перемещенные лица и мигранты часто относятся к числу наиболее уязвимых к климатическим и погодным опасностям. За последнее десятилетие (2010–2019 годы) погодные явления вызвали, по оценкам, 23,1 миллиона перемещений людей в среднем каждый год. В первой половине 2020 года было зарегистрировано около 9,8 мил-лиона перемещений, в основном из-за гидрометеорологических опасностей и стихийных бедствий, в основном сосредоточенных в Южной и Юго-Восточной Азии и на Африканском Роге. Проблемы с развитием и неврологические проблемы Воздействие токсинов в окружающей среде и связанные со стрессом по-следствия изменения климата могут оказать негативное влияние на невро-логическое здоровье. По данным Национального института наук о здоровье окружающей среды , ученые считают, что факторы окружающей среды играют роль в развитии как болезни Паркинсона, так и болезни Альцгеймера. Токсины в пище и воде также могут привести к проблемам со здоровь-ем у развивающегося плода. Например, изменение климата может вызвать вредное цветение водо-рослей, которые увеличивают биотоксины в рыбе и морепродук-тах. Увеличение содержания тяжелых металлов, таких как ртуть и свинец, загрязняющих морепродукты, может привести к снижению IQ у развиваю-щегося плода. Кто больше всего подвержен риску? Хотя все население может испытывать последствия изменения кли-мата, некоторые районы подвергаются большему риску, чем другие. Области, наиболее подверженные риску последствий изменения кли-мата для здоровья, включают: • прибрежные районы; • горные районы; • полярные регионы; • маленькие острова; • мегаполисы; • страны с нехваткой медицинских учреждений. Изменение климата во многих отношениях представляет значительный риск для здоровья человека. Стихийные бедствия и экстремальные погодные явления могут привес-ти к травмам, проблемам с психическим здоровьем, повышенному риску за-ражения и смерти. Ущерб инфраструктуре может также привести к долго-срочным последствиям для здоровья и благополучия. Решение проблемы изменения климата жизненно важно, чтобы помочь ограничить эти последствия и риски для здоровья. Точки невозврата. Изменение климата с течением времени ускоряется, потенциально до так называемой точки невозврата. Климатологи выделяют явления, после которых последствия климати-ческого кризиса могут стать необратимыми, например: - полное исчезновение морского льда в Арктике летом, - исчезновение ледяных щитов Гренландии и Антарктики, - коллапс экосистем Амазонского леса и бореальных лесов в России и Канаде, - таяние вечной мерзлоты. Точную дату наступления этих последствий назвать нельзя, так как будущие изменения будут зависеть от того, как быстро человечество сокра-тит выбросы парниковых газов. Если выбросы парниковых газов в ближайшее время не сократить, то один из наихудших сценариев — это потепление планеты больше чем на 4 °C к концу века или даже раньше. Такое потепление предполагает крупномасштабные экстремальные по-годные явления: - несовместимая с жизнью жара, - окисление океана, - вымирание видов, - значительное таяние ледяных щитов планеты и повышение роста уров-ня Мирового океана на несколько метров, - переселение миллиардов людей, - вспышки инфекционных заболеваний, - конфликты из-за воды и еды, - мировой хаос. Чтобы избежать такого развития событий, Парижское соглашение по климату предполагает не превышать рост температуры планеты более чем на 1,5°C по сравнению с доиндустриальным уровнем. Существует понятие углеродной нейтральности (нулевые чистые выб-росы парниковых газов) — это баланс между выбросами парниковых газов и их поглощением внутри страны, чтобы в итоге получился ноль. Например, в 2020 году Китай заявил о намерении достигнуть углеродной нейтральности к 2060 году, а Япония — к 2050 году. Для этого нужно трансформировать все секторы экономики, перейти на зеленые технологии, а также сократить сегод-няшние масштабы перепотребления. Что можно делать уже сегодня: - увеличивать долю возобновляемых источников энергии, - использовать новые технологии в промышленности, - стимулировать население переходить на устойчивые рационы питания (содержащие больше растительных, чем животных продуктов), - снижать количество твердых коммунальных отходов, - трансформировать лесное хозяйство и многое другое Обычные люди могут менять свои ежедневные привычки — это тоже имеет очень большое значение и реально входит в глобальные усилия по ста-билизации климата.

Геоинженерия — радикальное вмешательство в судьбу планеты У ученых есть крайне нежелательный, но, возможно, эффективный спо-соб вмешаться в жизнедеятельность Земли — геоинженерия. Это целе-направленное крупномасштабное вмешательство в природные системы Зем-ли, которое должно помочь замедлить изменения климата. Геоинженерия делится на две разные по способу воздействия группы: 1. Удаление углекислого газа из атмосферы Для этого можно использовать разнообразные методы. Например, улав-ливать углекислый газ специальными установками из атмосферы. Удобрять океан железом, чтобы увеличить его биопродуктивность и, соответственно, поток углекислого газа в океан (поскольку рыбы его поглощают). Или выса-живать новые и восстанавливать старые леса — это тоже методы удаления СО2. 2. Управление солнечной радиацией Чем больше солнечного света отражается от Земли, тем меньше тепла остается в атмосфере, следовательно, планета охлаждается. С этими мето-дами работают в ИГКЭ. Самый популярный способ управлять солнечной ра-диацией — создать светоотражающий аэрозольный слой в стратосфере (это примерно 20 км над Землей). В качестве активного вещества предлагают суль-фаты и карбонат кальция. Этот способ, по сути, повторяет эффект вул-канических извержений, ведь после них — если извержение было мощное и аэрозоли попали на достаточно большие высоты — снижается средняя гло-бальная температура на Земле! Так отражают солнечную радиацию вулканическое извержение и при-вязной аэростат, который закачивает сульфатные аэрозоли в стратосферу. Спасет ли нас посадка деревьев? Нет, планету нельзя охладить, высаживая деревья. Во-первых, не хва-тит площадей, поскольку людям еще нужно где-то сажать растения для пищи. Во-вторых, поглощает кислород только молодой лес. Старый лес и по-валенные деревья — разлагающаяся биомасса, которая выделяет углекислый газ. Эту биомассу нужно убирать и утилизировать — в общем, за всеми вы-саженными лесами нужно следить, чтобы они продолжали «работать». А вот в дополнение к другим методам улучшения климата высаживание деревьев вполне можно использовать. А куда девать CO2, выловленный из атмосферы? Углекислый газ можно хранить в подземных резервуарах, например в полостях, откуда были выкачаны газ или нефть. Такие места есть и в морях, и на земле. Но чтобы углекислый газ куда-то закачать, его еще надо туда доставить. То есть не просто уловить СО2 из атмосферы, но еще и построить систему, которая доставит его к областям закачки, до которых иногда тысячи километров. Это безумно дорого. Можно улавливать углекислый газ на производствах — это частично де-лают. Тогда он закачивается в баллоны и может быть далее использован, например, в химической промышленности, металлургии, пищевой промыш-ленности. Конечно, это не сравнится с теми объемами, в которых его надо от-качать из атмосферы. Вероятнее всего, закачивать СО2 под землю достаточно безопасно. Но никто не исключает каких-то природных катаклизмов, из-за которых углекислый газ может выброшен обратно в атмосферу. Можно ли охладить Землю? Есть три вполне реальных способа снижения температуры Земли. 1. Уменьшать выбросы парниковых газов. Это подразумевает переход на более экологичное топливо, на альтернативные источники энергии, где это возможно, и на разумное потребление ресурсов. 2. Удалять углекислый газ из атмосферы. Пока теми методами, которые изучены. Но нужна и скорейшая разработка новых методов, которые иссле-дователи уже предлагают, но пока они не изучены до конца. 3. Управлять солнечной радиацией. Сделай текст кратким","completion":"В последние годы климат Земли изменился: страны испытывают аномальную жару, суровые зимы, засухи и наводнения. Это связано с глобальным изменением климата, увеличением средней температуры из-за парникового эффекта, вызванного деятельностью человека, и повышением уровня мирового океана. Катастрофические последствия ожидаются, если немедленно не решить проблемы охраны окружающей среды: температура может подняться на 3,7-4,8 °С к 2100 году, что станет критичным для экологии планеты. Могут появиться территории, непригодные для жизни, удар по биологическому разнообразию, нехватка питьевой воды, голод, эпидемии и политические конфликты. Чтобы избежать катастрофических последствий, необходимо сократить выбросы парниковых газов и развивать альтернативные источники энергии. Важно также разработать стратегию адаптации общества к изменению климата, меняя подход к использованию природных ресурсов и промышленному производству. Парижское соглашение 2015 года является глобальной попыткой контролировать изменение климата, с обязательствами стран по снижению выбросов и поддержке уязвимых государств. Людям также стоит вносить свой вклад в решение экологической проблемы, меняя свои повседневные привычки, применяя энергосберегающие технологии и отдавая предпочтение устойчивым продуктам питания."},{"prompt":"「 *FAMILY 100* 」*Jawablah pertanyaan berikut ini!*Sma N Di Jakarta SelatanJumlah jawaban: 6Waktu: 120 detik","completion":"1.

Ernest Mach ve Viyana Çevresi felsefecileri gibi doğa bilimleri kökenli düşünürler, gözlem ve deney yoluyla doğrulanamayan her türlü metafizik iddialara şüpheyle yaklaşmışlardır. Bu bakış açısına göre, atomlar gibi doğrudan gözlemlenemeyen entitelerin varlığı konusunda kesin bir yargıya varmak zordur. Buna karşılık, sosyal bilim kökenli felsefeciler ve özellikle materyalizm ve diyalektik materyalizmi savunan düşünürler (örneğin, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels ve Vladimir Lenin), maddenin, doğanın ve evrenin temel yapısının, duyularımızın ötesinde de olsa, varlığını apriori bir kabul olarak alırlar. Bu düşünürler, fiziksel dünyanın varlığını ve işleyişini açıklamak üzere, hem tarihsel hem de ontolojik bir perspektiften maddenin var olduğunu iddia ederler. Bu farklı yaklaşımlar arasındaki çekişmenin, Vladimir Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" (Materialism and Empirio-criticism) isimli eserinde doruğa ulaştığı görülmektedir. Lenin bu eserinde, Mach ve benzeri emprio-kritik akımları eleştirirken, bilimin ve felsefenin materyalist anlayışının ve diyalektik yönteminin üstünlüğünü savunur. Doğa bilimlerindeki bu düşünce ayrılığı, daha sonra deney ve gözlemlerin gelişimiyle çözülmüştür. 20. yüzyılın başlarında fiziksel atomun varlığının gözlemlenmesi ve kuantum mekaniğinin gelişmesiyle, atomun varlığı artık sorgulanamaz bir gerçek olarak kabul edilmiştir. Bu durum, doğa bilimlerinde empirist yaklaşımların önemini azaltmış ve sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin, özellikle Demokritos ve Epikür'den beri savunduğu teorik ön kabullerin doğruluğunu kanıtlanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, fizik gibi bir alanın doğa bilimci empirstler tarafından değil, sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin teorik perspektiflerince doğru bir şekilde öngörülebilmiş olması, bilim ve felsefe tarihinde ironik ve dikkate değer bir örnektir.

Erken dönem atomcular (Demokritos, Epikür) ve sosyal bilimci materyalistler (Marx, Engels, Lenin) atomların varlığını teorik bir önkabul olarak kabul ederken, pozitivist ve emprio-kritik yaklaşımlar, duyumsal gözleme dayanarak bu tür varlıkların varlığını sorgular. 3. **Doğa Bilimi ve Sosyal Bilim Ayrımı:** Buradaki ana ironi, doğa bilimleri kökenli filozofların, yani emprio-kritik yaklaşımı savunanların, fizikte daha sonra kanıtlanacak atom teorisine karşı daha temkinli bir tutum sergilemiş olmalarıdır. Sosyal bilim kökenli filozoflar, bilimsel kanıtların eksikliğine rağmen, maddenin atomik yapısına dair daha kesin bir inanç belirtmişlerdir. 4. **Zamanın Önemi ve İdeolojik Bağlam:** Tartışmanın tarihsel bağlamı, belirli fikirlerin kabulünü ve redde edilmesini etkilemiştir. Bu, Lenin'in, pozitivist ve emprio-kritik yaklaşımların sınırları üzerine eleştiriler getirerek, materyalist bir dünya görüşünü ileri sürdüğü döneme denk gelir. Bilimdeki ilerlemeler ve yeni keşifler, zamanla materyalist görüşlerin bazı yönlerini destekler hale gelmiştir. Sonuç olarak, bu tartışmanın karmaşıklığı, sadece felsefi bir çekişme değil, aynı zamanda bilimin kendisi ve toplumun bilimi nasıl algıladığı hakkında derin bir soruşturma sunduğunu gösterir. Bilimsel keşif ve teorik anlayış arasındaki etkileşim, zaman içinde değişir ve gelişir, ve bu, sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin neden doğa bilimci emprio-kritiklerden daha \\"haklı\\" çıktığı sorusuna karmaşık bir yanıt sunar. Bilim tarihi, bu tür ideolojik ve teorik çatışmalarla doludur ve her yenilik, genellikle mevcut düşünce yapılarını sorgulamayı ve genişletmeyi gerektirir."},{"prompt":"Act like a marketer, give me a description for pins in pinterest on the topic of earning online up to 150 characters.

Empristler ve materyalistler arasındaki bu temel ayrım, felsefi metodolojiden ziyade dünya görüşleri ve varlık hakkındaki temel inançları üzerine kurulmuş bir ayrımdır. Empristler, ancak duyu organlarımızla algılayabildiğimiz, yani gözlemleyebildiğimiz şeylerin var olduğunu savunurken; materyalistler, duyumlarımızın ötesinde var olan, ancak teorik olarak kavranabilen varlıkların ve dinamiklerin de gerçek olduğunu iddia ettiler. Bu ayrım, bilimin gelişim tarihinde oldukça belirgin bir rol oynar. Doğa bilimlerinden gelen empristlerin gözleme ve deneye dayalı bir yaklaşım geliştirmeleri, bilimsel metot açısından bir temel taş oluşturmuştur. Ancak, bilim tarihindeki önemli anlar göstermiştir ki, büyük teorik ilerlemeler sık sık gözlem verilerinin ötesine geçen spekülatif düşüncelere dayanmıştır. Bu anlamda, materyalistlerin \\"duyum dışı\\" varlıkları kabul etmeleri, özellikle atom teorisi gibi, zamanla doğrulanacak teorik yapıların öncüsü olmuştur. Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Empriyokritisizm\\" eseri, bu tartışmayı ideolojik bir çerçevede ele alarak, materyalizmin bilimsel yöntem ve gerçekliği daha iyi açıkladığını savunur. Lenin, bilimin sadece gözlemlenebilir olayları değil, bunların altında yatan yapısal ve maddeleşmiş temelleri de incelemesi gerektiğini vurgular. Bu bağlamda, Marx'ist materyalizm, doğa ve toplumun bir bütün olarak ele alınması gerektiğini savunarak doğa bilimleri ile sosyal bilimler arasında köprüler kurmaya çalışır. Burada dikkat çeken nokta, bilimin ve felsefenin sosyal ve tarihsel koşullar içinde nasıl şekillendiğidir. İlerleme, sıklıkla belirli bir zaman ve mekanda, belirli bir sosyal ve ideolojik çerçevede, mevcut teorik ve metodolojik yaklaşımların sınırlarını zorlayan ve bu sınırları aşan bilim insanları ve düşünürler tarafından sağlanmıştır. Dolayısıyla, empristlerin materyalistlere \\"gerisine düşmesi\\", felsefi veya metodolojik bir eksiklikten ziyade, daha çok bilimin kendisinin nasıl bir sosyal faaliyet olduğunun ve bu faaliyetin nasıl sosyo-kültürel faktörlerden etkilendiğinin bir göstergesidir."},{"prompt":"nuts and bolts","completion":"\\"Nuts and bolts\\" refers to both a literal and a figurative concept.

Bu, bilgi ve keşif sürecinde teorik yaklaşımların ve felsefi çerçevelerin önemine işaret eder. İki taraf arasındaki temel fark, doğayı anlama ve yorumlama biçimlerinden kaynaklanır. İlk olarak, Ernst Mach ve Viyana Çevresi felsefecileri gibi empristler, duyumları ve gözlemleri temel alarak, doğrulanamayan her türlü metafiziğe ve teoriye karşı derin bir kuşkuyla yaklaşır. Bu, bilimsel bilginin yalnızca doğrudan deneyimler ve gözlemler aracılığıyla elde edilebileceği anlamına gelir. Özellikle Mach, fizik teorilerinin araçsal anlayışını savunmuş ve atomlar gibi gözlemlenemeyen varlıkların varlığı konusunda kuşkucu bir tutum sergilemiştir. Öte yandan, sosyal bilimlerden gelen materyalistler - Engels, Lenin ve hatta Marx gibi düşünürler - maddenin ve onun temel birimlerinin, yani atomların, varlığını a priori kabul ederler. Bu yaklaşım, bir yandan Demokritos ve Epikür gibi antik atomist filozoflardan ilham alırken, diğer yandan da toplumsal ve ekonomik yapıları maddi koşullarla açıklama eğilimi gösterir. Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Empriyo-Kritisizm\\" adlı eseri, bu iki farklı yaklaşım arasındaki fikir mücadelesinin doruk noktasını temsil eder. Lenin, Mach ve benzeri pozisyonları eleştirirken, materyalist epistemolojinin ve ontolojinin önemini vurgular ve bilimsel sosyalizmin temellerini atar. Bu tarihsel gelişim serisi, doğru kabul edilecek bilginin kaynağı ve doğruluğun nasıl belirleneceği konusunda farklı felsefi yaklaşımların önemini vurgular. Doğa bilimleri kökenli empristlerin, fizik gibi bir alanda, sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin gerisine düşmüş olmaları, salt deneyim ve mantık yoluyla elde edilen bilginin sınırlılıklarını ve teorik çerçevelerin, özellikle de doğa bilimlerinde, keşiflerde oynadığı temel rolü gösterir. İronik bir şekilde, 20. yüzyılın başlarında atomun varlığının nihayet kesin olarak kanıtlanması, materyalist yaklaşıma tarihsel bir haklılık kazandırdı. Ancak, bu olay aynı zamanda bilimin, özellikle teorik fizik ve kuantum mekaniği alanlarında, gözlemlenebilir olmayan varlıkları anlamada ve açıklamada felsefi ve teorik spekülasyonların önemini de göstermiştir.

Bu karşılaştırmada, özellikle fizik olmak üzere doğa bilimlerinde empirizme dayanan yaklaşımlar ile sosyal bilimlerde materyalist yaklaşımlar arasındaki ilişki önemlidir. Belirtilen örnekte, Ernst Mach gibi fizikçi ve felsefecilerin atomların varlığı konusundaki şüpheleri ile Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels ve Vladimir Lenin gibi sosyal bilim kökenli düşünürlerin atomun varlığını apriori bir kabul olarak benimsemeleri arasındaki kontrast ele alınıyor. Bu durumun çeşitli nedenleri vardır: 1. **Felsefi Temeller ve Yaklaşımlar:** Empirist ve pozitivist yaklaşımlar, gözlemlenebilir olgulara ve deneyime büyük önem verirler. Bu nedenle, özellikle 19. yüzyılın sonlarından itibaren, atom gibi gözlemlenemeyen nesnelerin varlığına karşı temkinli bir yaklaşım sergilemişlerdir. Materyalistler ise, maddenin ve onun temel yapı taşlarının varlığını, insan bilincinin ve toplumsal yapıların temeli olarak kabul ederler; bu sebeple atomlar gibi temel yapı taşlarının varlığını teorik bir önkabul olarak kabul etmeye daha açıktırlar. 2. **Bilimin Gelişimi ve Doğrulama:** Fizik ve diğer doğa bilimlerindeki gelişmeler, atomların ve temel parçacıkların varlığını doğrulayacak deneylerin ve gözlem yöntemlerinin geliştirilmesini mümkün kılmıştır. Bu gelişmeler, empirist ve pozitivist düşünürlerin bile atomun varlığını kabul etmesine yol açmıştır. Bu durum, bilimin metodolojik gelişiminin ve yeni teknolojilerin, felsefi tutumları ve kabulleri nasıl değiştirebileceğinin bir örneğidir. 3. **Tarihsel ve Toplumsal Bağlam:** Marx, Engels, Lenin gibi sosyal bilim kökenli düşünürlerin felsefi ve siyasi amaçları, onların materyalist görüşleri benimsemelerinde etkili olmuştur. Toplumun maddi koşullarına odaklanan bu düşünürler, maddenin temel özelliklerini anlamayı ve topluma yansımalarını çözümlemeyi önemsemişlerdir. Bu çerçevede, atom gibi temel yapı taşlarının varlığını kabul etmek, onların genel dünya görüşleriyle uyumludur. Sonuç olarak, sosyal ve doğa bilimleri arasındaki bu karşılaştırmada, felsefi temeller ve dünya görüşleri, deney ve gözlem teknolojilerinin gelişimi, ve tarihsel-toplumsal bağlam gibi faktörler önemlidir. Bu faktörler, bir disiplinin diğerine \\"gerisine düşmesi\\" veya spesifik konularda \\"haklı çıkması\\" gibi durumlar üzerinde belirleyici olmuştur.

Sonuçta, doğa hakkında haklı çıkan taraf sosyal bilimci materyalistler oldu. Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte doğa bilimci empristler 2300 senelik bir gecikmeyle de olsa (Demokritos’un ölümü MÖ 370) atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","completion":"Bu durum, bilim felsefesi ve bilim tarihi içerisinde önemli bir tartışma alanını oluşturur ve birden fazla nedenden kaynaklanmaktadır. Bu tartışmanın ana ekseni, pozitivist ve emprist yaklaşımların duyusal deneyimlere dayanan bilgiye olan vurgusu ile daha geniş ontolojik ve epistemolojik iddialarda bulunan materyalist ve naturalist yaklaşımlar arasındaki farktır. 1. **Felsefi Yaklaşımların Doğası:** Pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm, bilginin kökeni olarak duyusal deneyimleri öne sürer. Bu yaklaşım, doğa bilimlerinin duyusal olarak gözlemlenebilir olaylara odaklanan metodolojisine uygun düşer. Ancak, bu yaklaşımlar duyusal olarak gözlemlenemeyen fenomenlere, örneğin atomların varlığına, daha kuşkucu bir tutum sergileme eğilimindedir. Bu kuşkuculuk, özellikle fizikte atomaltı parçacıkların varlığı gibi konuların duyusal olarak doğrudan gözlemlenememesi nedeniyle, bu tür fenomenlerin varlığını kabul etmek için yeterli kanıt olmadığını savunur. 2. **Bilimin Evrimi ve Yenilikçilik:** Fizik ve doğa bilimlerinde ilerlemeler, zamanla duyusal doğrulamanın ötesine geçen teorilerin ve metodolojilerin geliştirilmesini gerektirdi. Bu açıdan, sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin - özellikle Marx, Engels, ve Lenin gibi figürlerin - maddenin temel yapısına dair teorileri ve atomun varlığı gibi konulara dair daha geniş iddiaları, bilimin ilerleyen safhalarında doğrulanacak fikirlerin önünü açmıştır. Diğer bir deyişle, materyalist yaklaşımın epistemolojik öngörüsü ve ontolojik iddiaları, duyusal gözlem teknolojilerinin ilerlemesiyle birlikte, sonradan doğa bilimcileri tarafından doğrulanan teorik temeller sundu. 3. **Bilgi ve Teori Arasındaki İlişki:** Bir teorinin bilimsel kabul görmesi, sadece duyusal gözlemlere dayanmaz; aynı zamanda bu teorinin öngördüğü sonuçların deneysel ve gözlemsel çalışmalarla tutarlı olması gerekir. Demokritos ve Epikür dönemlerinden itibaren atomlar hakkındaki teorik öngörüler, duyusal gözlemlerle doğrudan teyit edilemese de, fizik ve kimyanın gelişimiyle birlikte bu teorilerin deneysel sonuçlarla tutarlı olduğu gösterilmiştir. Örneğin, atomlar ve atomaltı parçacıkların varlığı, 20. yüzyılın başlarında yeni kurulan kuantum mekaniği ve diğer fiziksel teorilerle doğrulanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, bu karşılaşma, bilginin doğası ve bilimsel doğrulama yöntemleri üzerine derin felsefi ve metodolojik soruları gündeme getirmektedir. Doğa bilimleri ve sosyal bilimler arasındaki bu etkileşim, bilimin felsefi temelleri ve bilimin nasıl ilerlediği hakkında önemli dersler sunmaktadır."},{"prompt":"windows 通过pip 安装了deepspeed 请问他的安装目录在哪","completion":"截至我的最后更新（2023年4月），Deepspeed 主要针对 Linux 环境进行了优化和测试，而不是 Windows。因此，直接在 Windows 上通过 pip 安装 Deepspeed 可能会遇到困难或是根本无法实现。如果你是在 Windows Subsystem for Linux（WSL）之上安装的，那么它会被安装在 Linux 子系统的 Python 库目录中，而不是 Windows 的目录结构中。 假设你在 Windows 上通过某种方式安装了 Deepspeed（或类似环境，如通过一些兼容层），Python 包的安装位置通常有两个： 1. **全局安装：** 对于全局安装，它通常安装在 Python 的 \`site-packages\` 目录下。你可以通过运行以下命令找到这个目录的具体位置： \`\`\`sh python -m site --user-site \`\`\` 或者， \`\`\`sh python -c \\"import site; print(site.getsitepackages())\\" \`\`\` 请注意：第一个命令会给出针对当前用户的安装位置，而第二个命令给出的是全局安装位置。 2. **用户目录安装（使用 \`--user\` 标志）：** 如果你在安装时使用了 \`--user\` 标志，那它会安装在你的用户目录下的一个特殊位置。这个位置可以通过运行以下命令找到： \`\`\`sh python -m site --user-site \`\`\` 根据你是如何安装 Deepspeed 的，以上命令之一应该能帮助你找到它的安装目录。 然而，如果你是利用 WSL、Docker 或类似工具在 Windows 上运行 Linux 环境，并在其上安装 Deepspeed，你也需要在相应的环境中执行这些命令，而不是在 Windows 的命令提示符或 PowerShell 中执行。 再次强调，直接在原生 Windows 环境下安装 Deepspeed 可能并不支持，建议使用 WSL 或 Docker 在 Windows 上创建一个合适的 Linux 开发环境。"},{"prompt":"django static url in html","completion":"In Django, to use static files (e.g., images, JavaScript, and CSS files) in your templates, you first need to make sure that you've set up your static files correctly in your Django project settings. This involves defining STATIC_URL and STATICFILES_DIRS in your settings.py file, and possibly STATIC_ROOT if you're deploying your project. To reference static files in your HTML templates, you'll use the \`{% static %}\` template tag provided by Django. This tag generates the correct URL for static files by combining the value of \`STATIC_URL\` with the specified path to your static file. Here's how you can use the \`{% static %}\` tag in your HTML templates: 1. **Load the static template tag library**: At the top of your HTML template, you need to load the \`static\` tags by adding \`{% load static %}\`. 2. **Use the \`{% static %}\` tag**: Whenever you need to include a static file in your template (like a CSS file, JavaScript file, or an image), you use the \`{% static %}\` tag within the \`src\` or \`href\` attribute of your HTML element. You'll pass the path to your static file (relative to your static directory) as an argument to the \`{% static %}\` tag. Here's a simple example: \`\`\`html {% load static %} <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My Site</title> <!-- Include Static CSS file --> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" type=\\"text/css\\" href=\\"{% static 'css/style.css' %}\\"> </head> <body> <!-- Include an image from static files --> <img src=\\"{% static 'images/logo.png' %}\\" alt=\\"My Site Logo\\"> <!-- Include Static JavaScript file --> <script src=\\"{% static 'js/script.js' %}\\"><\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` In this example: - \`css/style.css\`, \`images/logo.png\`, and \`js/script.js\` are paths to static files relative to your static directories. - The \`{% static 'path/to/static/file' %}\` tag dynamically generates the full URL to the static file by appending the relative path (\`path/to/static/file\`) to the base static URL defined in \`STATIC_URL\`. Make sure your static files are located in one of the directories you've included in \`STATICFILES_DIRS\` or in a static folder within one of your apps (next to models.py, views.py, etc.). For production, don't forget to run \`python manage.py collectstatic\` to collect all your static files into \`STATIC_ROOT\` if you've set it."},{"prompt":"is the any tag for media?","completion":"Yes, in Django projects, while you have the \`{% static %}\` template tag for handling static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images that don't change), there is not a built-in template tag specifically for media files. Media files are usually user-uploaded content such as user profile pictures, documents, etc., and are handled differently from static files. This distinction is important because media files are typically stored and served separately from static files, especially in production environments. To serve media files in your Django templates, you typically use the \`MEDIA_URL\` setting that you define in your \`settings.py\` file. This setting specifies the base URL to use for serving media files uploaded by users. Here's how you can handle media files in your HTML templates without a specific tag like \`{% static %}\` for static files: 1. Firstly, make sure you have defined \`MEDIA_URL\` and \`MEDIA_ROOT\` in your \`settings.py\` file. \`MEDIA_URL\` is the URL that handles the media served from \`MEDIA_ROOT\`, like so: \`\`\`python MEDIA_URL = '/media/' MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media') \`\`\` 2. To serve media files in your templates, you need to manually construct the file's URL using the \`MEDIA_URL\` setting and the path of your media file relative to \`MEDIA_ROOT\`. However, in templates, you don't automatically get a context variable for \`MEDIA_URL\`, unlike the \`{% static %}\` tag that automatically prepends \`STATIC_URL\` to your paths. So you'd typically pass \`MEDIA_URL\` to your templates through your views or use a context processor. For Django to serve media files during development, you'll also need to update your project's \`urls.py\` file to include a URL pattern for media files: \`\`\`python from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static # Your urlpatterns list as it already exists urlpatterns = [ # ... your URLconf goes here ... ] if settings.DEBUG: urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) \`\`\` This setup is suitable for development but not recommended for production. In production, you should serve media files through a web server like Nginx or a cloud service like Amazon S3. Once everything is set up, here's how you might reference a media file (e.g., a user-uploaded profile picture) in your template: \`\`\`html <img src=\\"{{ MEDIA_URL }}{{ user.profile.picture.url }}\\" alt=\\"User profile picture\\"> \`\`\` Alternatively, if your user's profile picture field is an \`ImageField\` or \`FileField\` in your model, you can directly use its \`.url\` attribute to get the full path, assuming you're passing the user (or the user's profile) to the template: \`\`\`html <img src=\\"{{ user.profile.picture.url }}\\" alt=\\"User profile picture\\"> \`\`\` This approach automatically prepends the \`MEDIA_URL\` to the file path. Remember, serving media files through Django using the above method is only suitable for development purposes. For production, always serve media files directly through your web server or a cloud storage solution to ensure efficiency and security."},{"prompt":"django static link in views","completion":"In Django, there might be scenarios where you need to dynamically generate URLs to static files directly in your views. Since static files such as JavaScript, CSS, and image files are typically not meant to change after deployment, Django provides a way to manage these resources efficiently through its static files app. However, it's less common to generate static file URLs in views compared to templates or directly in the HTML with the \`{% static %}\` template tag. When you have a use case that necessitates generating static file URLs in your views, you can use Django's \`static()\` function provided by \`django.templatetags.static\`. This function is essentially the programmatic equivalent of the \`{% static %}\` template tag, allowing you to append the relative path to a static file to the \`STATIC_URL\` configuration. Here is how to use the \`static()\` function in your views: 1. First, ensure you've set up your static files correctly in your \`settings.py\` file by specifying \`STATIC_URL\`. For example: \`\`\`python # settings.py STATIC_URL = '/static/' \`\`\` 2. In your view, import the \`static\` function and use it to generate the full URL to your static file. Here's an example: \`\`\`python # views.py from django.http import HttpResponse from django.templatetags.static import static def my_view(request): # Generate the URL for a static file image_url = static('img/logo.png') # Use the static file URL in some context, for example, return it in an HttpResponse return HttpResponse(f'<img src=\\"{image_url}\\" alt=\\"Logo\\">') \`\`\` In this example, \`static('img/logo.png')\` dynamically generates the URL for a static image assuming \`img/logo.png\` is located within one of your STATICFILES_DIRS or within the static directory of one of your installed apps. Remember, direct manipulation of static file URLs in views is less common. Typically, static files are linked in templates using the \`{% static %}\` template tag. Directly referencing static files in views might be necessary for dynamically generating content or when passing static URLs to a context for more complex rendering scenarios not directly covered by template logic. Using static files like this in views should be done judiciously. For most use cases involving static content, leveraging the \`{% static %}\` tag within templates is the preferred and recommended approach in Django."},{"prompt":"как убрать нумерацию сртаниц latex","completion":"Для того чтобы убрать нумерацию страниц в LaTeX, можно использовать команду pagestyle{empty} в преамбуле документа.

Основы сотрудничества между двумя ‎странами были заложены в ходе официального визита президента Казахстана Нурсултана Назарбаева в Иран в ноябре 1992 года. В ходе визита был подписан Протокол о создании Совместной межправительственной комиссии по торгово-экономическому, промышленному и научному сотрудничеству. Дальнейшему укреплению дружеских отношений способствовал визит президента Ирана Али Акбара Хашеми Рафсанджани в октябре 1993 года. Посольство Казахстана в Иране функционирует с 1993 года. В октябре 2007 года было открыто Генеральное консульство Республики Казахстан в городе Горган. В октябре 2018 года начало функционировать консульство в городе Бендер-Аббас. Посольство Ирана в Казахстана функционирует с 1992 года. Генеральные консульства Ирана открыты в Актау в октябре 2009 года и в Алма-Ате в августе 2012 года[2]. В рамках визитов Нурсултана Назарбаева в Тегеран в мае 1996 года и октябре 1999 года был подписан ряд экономических соглашений в области транспорта, транзита, нефти и газа. Президент Ирана Мохаммад Хатами дважды посещал Казахстан: в мае 1998 года для участия в Саммите Организации экономического сотрудничества и в апреле 2002 года с официальным визитом. В октябре 2007 года президент Казахстана посетил с официальным визитом Тегеран, а также принял участие во II Саммите прикаспийских государств. Почтовые марки Казахстана, посвящённые казахстанско-иранским отношениям В апреле 2009 года состоялся визит президента Ирана Махмуда Ахмадинежада в Астану. В июне 2011 года он принял участие в Саммите Шанхайской организации сотрудничества (ШОС). В августе 2013 года Нурсултан Назарбаев принял участие в церемонии инаугурации президента Ирана Хасана Рухани. В сентябре 2014 года состоялся государственный визит президента Ирана Хасана Рухани в Казахстан. В ходе визита было принято Совместное заявление, подписаны Соглашение о международных автомобильных перевозках пассажиров и грузов, Дорожная карта по развитию торгово-экономического и инвестиционного сотрудничества. 21-22 декабря 2016 года состоялся официальный визит президента Ирана Хасана Рухани в Казахстан. 10 сентября 2017 года президент Ирана Хасан Рухани принял участие в I Саммите Организации исламского сотрудничества по технологиям и науке в Астане. 12 августа 2018 года президент Ирана Рухани принял участие в Каспийском саммите в Актау. Главы двух государств встречались в рамках XIII Саммита ШОС в Бишкеке (сентябрь 2013 г.), IV Саммита СВМДА в Шанхае (май 2014 года), Прикаспийского саммита в Астрахани (сентябрь 2014 года), церемонии открытия железной дороги Казахстан — Туркменистан — Иран (декабрь 2014 года), заседания Высшего Евразийского экономического совета в Сочи (октябрь 2019 года). Иран поддержал кандидатуру Казахстана в непостоянные члены Совета безопасности ООН на 2017—2018 годы, проголосовал за проведение Международной специализированной выставки «ЭКСПО 2017» в Астане, подписал Устав Исламской организации по продовольственной безопасности со штаб-квартирой в Астане.[3] В Алматы было проведено два раунда переговоров «шестёрки» международных посредников и Ирана по ядерной программе ИРИ. Иран в качестве одной из стран-гарантов перемирия в Сирии участвовал в международных встречах в рамках Астанинского процесса.","completion":"Установление дипломатических отношений между Республикой Казахстан и Исламской Республикой Иран, датируемое 29 января 1992 года, стало знаковым событием в истории двусторонних связей двух стран. Этот момент положил начало развитию богатых и многогранных взаимоотношений, которые охватили широкий спектр сфер, включая торговлю, экономику, промышленность и науку. Фундамент для углубления сотрудничества был заложен в ноябре 1992 года, когда президент Казахстана Нурсултан Назарбаев совершил официальный визит в Иран. В рамках этого визита был подписан ключевой документ — Протокол о создании Совместной межправительственной комиссии, задачей которой стало содействие в развитии торгово-экономического, промышленного и научного сотрудничества между двумя государствами. Особенно важным этапом в укреплении дружеских отношений стал визит президента Ирана Али Акбара Хашеми Рафсанджани казахстанскую сторону в октябре 1993 года, который способствовал ещё большему приближению двух народов. Посольство Казахстана в Иране, начавшее функционировать с 1993 года, и открытие Генерального консульства в городе Горган в октябре 2007 года, а также запуск консульства в Бендер-Аббас в октябре 2018 года, стали весомым вкладом в укрепление дипломатических связей. С иранской стороны также были предприняты шаги на пути развития двусторонних отношений, среди которых — открытие посольства в Казахстане сразу после налаживания дипломатических отношений в 1992 году и создание Генеральных консульств в Актау и Алма-Ате. В последующие годы отношения между Казахстаном и Ираном продолжали развиваться динамично, что отразилось в подписании ряда значимых экономических соглашений в области транспорта, транзита, нефти и газа во время визитов Нурсултана Назарбаева в Тегеран. Важными вехами в дипломатических отношениях стали визиты высших официальных лиц обеих стран. Например, президент Ирана Мохаммад Хатами посетил Казахстан с целью укрепления двусторонних связей, а президент Казахстана проявил инициативу в участии в прикаспийских и международных саммитах, в числе которых II Саммит прикаспийских государств в Тегеране. Особенно следует отметить активизацию визитов и переговоров на высшем уровне в последние годы, что свидетельствует о стремлении обеих сторон к дальнейшему углублению и расширению сотрудничества. Среди ярких событий — участие президента Ирана Хасана Рухани в различных международных форумах и саммитах на территории Казахстана, что подтверждает важность и особую роль Астаны в региональной и мировой политике. Помимо политического и экономического сотрудничества, страны активно взаимодействуют и на культурном уровне, что проявляется, в частности, в проведении дней культуры, обменах в области искусства и литературы, а также в образовательных программах. Таким образом, история дипломатических отношений между Казахстаном и Ираном представляет собой пример успешного и взаимовыгодного сотрудничества, основанного на взаимном уважении, доверии и стремлении к совместному развитию."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

That’s nearly inevitable. How can a novel by an African American or African Caribbean writer not take stock of the legacy of slavery and racist mistreatment? How can an African or Indian novel, or any other from a former outpost of empire, not speak to, among other things, the experience of oppression or the chaos that so often follows when the oppressor withdraws? Chinua Achebe has a famous essay of complaint against Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, itself a pretty dense little novella of ideas, but his better rejoinders are his fiction from Things Fall Apart forward. The essay states his ideas; the novels embody them. History, as I suggest elsewhere, is the one inescapable fact. Stephen Dedalus’s “History is the nightmare from which I’m trying to awake,” is merely a sign of his callowness. Writers as outwardly different as Salman Rushdie, R. K. Narayan, Kiran Desai, Caryl Phillips, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Louise Erdrich, and Edward P. Jones have in common the making of fiction filled with ideas in response to what history has handed them. Jones shocked readers of all races with his novel of black slave￾owners, The Known World (2003), but that material ironically freed him to talk about issues of race, privilege, class, and right and wrong in ways that a conventional white-black slavery tale might not have. So, too, with Phillips, whose Cambridge (1991) is an astonishing experiment in voice, bringing together a nineteenth-century English woman sent to the West Indies to look over her father’s sugar plantation and the slave, freed and eventually resold into bondage, whose name gives the novel its title. What matters most, perhaps, in all these novels, and what makes the novel matter as a place for ideas, is the ability to bring broad ranges of experience down to the individual level. Groups don’t lead lives; persons do. Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children isn’t the story of “India” gaining independence; it’s the story of Saleem Sinai, one person, the family into which he is born, his experiences as an individual in an emerging nation. It is through him that the collective can be expressed. Right there is the genius of the novel form. It is the perfect medium for capturing individual existence, and in turn to be a near-perfect medium for capturing the experience of the group. The life of the ordinary person—right there is a big idea, the first one the novel ever had. The earlier literary forms were highly elitist. Tragedy and epic are both about the ruling class, although for rather different reasons. Comedy often had lesser nobility for characters; I can’t speak for you, but my ancestors would show up in Shakespeare, if at all, as the grave diggers and comic servants, the entirely expendable class whose stage time is counted in seconds. Even the lyric was intended for the leisured classes capable of reading—it had shepherds in it but wasn’t for (or even about) real shepherds. No, if your surname indicated the work you did or where you did it— Miller, Cooper, Smith, Farrier, Forester or Forster or Foster—you were excluded from the old literature. Then this new form comes along, catering to an emerging middle class and often about its members, and it’s capacious enough that there might be room in there for someone who actually works for a living. It’s still better to own things than do things, but it’s a start. No accident about it, though: the rise of the novel coincides with the rise of a middle class, and of liberty, and of democracy. This is a form in which ordinary people just might matter. But it’s not about a class, only about individual members thereof. In fact, it’s the first form in the history of Western civilization to suggest that a single person might actually matter in the grand scheme even if that person doesn’t wear a crown. What a concept! You doubt? What do these people have in common: Tom Jones, Clarissa, Huck Finn, Jay Gatsby, George Babbitt, Augie March, Bridget Jones, Emma, Silas Lapham, Don Quixote? Eponymous characters all; that is, they give their names to the titles of novels in which they play starring roles. When did that happen before? Oedipus? Hamlet? King Lear, for crying out loud? If you wanted a title on the stage, you needed royal blood. The novel, on the other hand, goes for red blood rather than blue. This constitutes a huge change not only in literature but in the history of ideas. This chapter seems to suggest that the twentieth century has a lock on idea-centered fiction, which is too bad. Ideas, and important ones, have been invigorating fiction since its beginning, and one idea above all others. Sure, Thomas Hardy’s cosmic doubt or Dostoevsky’s investigations of man and God or of crime and punishment are indubitably philosophical, but so is Henry Fielding’s comic narrative of the foundling Tom Jones and his attempt to find his place in the world. And so is Dashiell Hammett’s mystery with a detective named Spade, digging, maybe reluctantly, for the truth.","completion":"ایده‌های بزرگ و اغلب بسیار ناخوشایند در دسته‌های آشوبناک \\"اقلیت\\" و \\"ادبیات پساکولونیال\\" سرکشی می‌کنند. این تقریبا اجتناب‌ناپذیر است. چگونه ممکن است رمانی از یک نویسنده آفریقایی-آمریکایی یا کارائیبی به میراث بردگی و تبعیض نژادی توجه نکند؟ چگونه می‌توان یک رمان آفریقایی یا هندی، یا هر کدام دیگر از پایگاه‌های سابق امپراتوری، به میان دیگر موضوعات، تجربه ستم یا آشوبی که اغلب پس از خروج ستمگر اتفاق می‌افتد، اشاره نکند؟ چینوا آچه‌به مقاله شکایتی مشهور علیه \\"قلب تاریکی\\" اثر جوزف کنراد دارد، که خود نوولی پر از ایده است، اما پاسخ‌های بهتر او در آثار داستانی‌اش از \\"وقتی همه چیز فرو پاشید\\" به بعد هستند. مقاله او ایده‌هایش را بیان می‌کند؛ رمان‌ها آنها را جسم می‌بخشند. تاریخ، همانطور که جای دیگری اشاره کردم، تنها حقیقت اجتناب ناپذیر است. \\"تاریخ کابوسی است که من سعی در بیدار شدن از آن دارم\\"، استیون ددالوس، تنها نشانه‌ای از ناپختگی اوست. نویسندگانی با ظاهری متفاوت مانند سلمان رشدی، آر. کی. نارایان، کیران دسای، کریل فیلیپس، تونی موریسون، آلیس واکر، لوئیز اردریچ و ادوارد پی. جونز این ویژگی را مشترک دارند که داستان‌هایی سرشار از ایده در پاسخ به آنچه تاریخ به آنها داده، می‌نویسند. جونز با رمان خود در مورد صاحبان برده سیاهپوست، \\"دنیای شناخته شده\\" (۲۰۰۳)، خوانندگان از هر نژادی را شوکه کرد، اما این موضوع به طور آیرونیک او را آزاد کرد تا درباره مسائل نژاد، امتیاز، طبقه و درست و غلط به روش‌هایی که یک داستان سنتی برده‌داری سفید-سیاه شاید نتوانسته بود، صحبت کند. همچنین با فیلیپس، که \\"کمبریج\\" (۱۹۹۱) آزمایش شگفت‌انگیزی در صدا است، که یک زن انگلیسی قرن نوزدهمی که برای بازرسی مزرعه قند پدرش به جزایر غربی فرستاده شده بود و برده‌ای که آزاد شده و در نهایت دوباره به بردگی فروخته شده بود، نام او عنوان رمان را می‌دهد. شاید مهم‌ترین چیز در همه این رمان‌ها، و آنچه که به رمان به عنوان جایگاهی برای ایده‌ها اهمیت می‌بخشد، توانایی آن‌ها در آوردن طیف گسترده‌ای از تجربیات به سطح فردی است. گروه‌ها زندگی نمی‌کنند؛ افراد انجام می‌دهند. \\"بچه‌های نیمه‌شب\\" رشدی داستان \\"هند\\" که استقلال به دست می‌آورد نیست؛ داستان سلیم سینایی است، یک نفر، خانواده‌ای که او به آن متولد شده، تجربیاتش به عنوان یک فرد در یک ملت در حال ظهور. از طریق او است که می‌توان جمعیت را بیان کرد. در اینجا استعداد فرم رمان آشکار می‌شود. این رسانه‌ای عالی برای ضبط وجود فردی است و در نتیجه تقریبا رسانه‌ای نزدیک به کامل برای ضبط تجربه گروه است. زندگی فرد عادی – اینجا یک ایده بزرگ است، اولین ایده‌ای که رمان تا به حال داشت. فرم‌های ادبی قبلی بسیار نخبه‌گرا بودند. تراژدی و حماسه هر دو درباره طبقه حاکم هستند، هرچند به دلایل نسبتا متفاوت. کمدی اغلب شخصیت‌هایی از اشراف کمتر را داشت؛ من نمی‌توانم برای شما صحبت کنم، اما اجداد من در شکسپیر، اگر اصلا ظاهر شوند، به عنوان کندوکاوگران قبر و خدمتکاران کمدی، طبقه‌ای کاملا قابل از بین رفتن که زمان صحنه آنها به ثانیه شمارده می‌شود، ظاهر می‌شدند. حتی شعر غنایی نیز برای طبقات تن‌آسا طراحی شده بود که قادر به خواندن بودند - در آن شبان وجود داشت اما برای (یا حتی درباره) شبان‌های واقعی نبود. نه، اگر نام خانوادگی شما کاری که انجام می‌دادید یا جایی که در آن کار می‌کردید را نشان می‌داد - میلر، کوپر، اسمیت، فریر، فارستر یا فاستر - شما از ادبیات قدیمی محروم بودید. سپس این فرم جدید ظاهر می‌شود، که به طبقه متوسط در حال ظهور خدمت می‌کند و اغلب درباره اعضای آن است و به اندازه‌ای جامع است که ممکن است فضایی در آن برای کسی باشد که واقعا برای زندگی کار می‌کند. هنوز هم بهتر است چیزهایی داشته باشیم تا کارهایی انجام دهیم، اما یک شروع است. اما اتفاقی در کار نیست: ظهور رمان با بلند شدن طبقه متوسط، و آزادی، و دموکراسی همزمان است. این یک فرم است که در آن افراد عادی ممکن است اهمیت داشته باشند. اما درباره یک طبقه نیست، فقط درباره اعضای فردی آن است. در واقع، اولین فرم در تاریخ تمدن غربی است که پیشنهاد می‌کند یک فرد تکی ممکن است حتی اگر آن فرد تاجی به سر ندارد در طرح بزرگ اهمیت داشته باشد. چه مفهومی! شک دارید؟ این افراد چه وجه مشترکی دارند: تام جونز، کلاریسا، هاک فین، جی گتسبی، جورج بابیت، آگی مارچ، بریجت جونز، اما، سایلاس لافام، دن کیشوت؟ همه شخصیت‌های اپونیم هستند؛ یعنی نام‌هایشان به عناوین رمان‌هایی که در آنها نقش‌های اصلی را بازی می‌کنند داده شده است. این پیش از این کی اتفاق افتاده بود؟ ادیپوس؟ هملت؟ کینگ لیر، به خاطر خدا؟ اگر می‌خواستید یک عنوان روی صحنه داشته باشید، به خون سلطنتی احتیاج داشتید. رمان، از طرف دیگر، به دنبال خون قرمز به جای خون آبی است. این تغییر بزرگی نه تنها در ادبیات بلکه در تاریخ ایده‌ها ایجاد می‌کند. این فصل به نظر می‌رسد که پیشنهاد می‌کند قرن بیستم انحصار ادبیات متمرکز بر ایده را دارد، که خیلی بد است. ایده‌ها، و ایده‌های مهم، از ابتدا داستان‌ها را پر جنب و جوش کرده‌اند، و یک ایده بیش از همه دیگران. البته، شک داشتن کیهانی توماس هاردی یا تحقیقات داستایوفسکی در مورد انسان و خدا یا جرم و مجازات قطعا فلسفی هستند، اما ناریتیو کمیک هنری فیلدینگ از فرزندخوانده تام جونز و تلاش‌های او برای یافتن جایگاه خود در جهان نیز همینطور است. و همچنین رمز و راز داشیل همت با یک کارآگاه به نام اسپید، که شاید با اکراه، برای حقیقت حفاری می‌کند."},{"prompt":"Doğa bilimleri kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve duyumdışı her türden metafiziğe karşı kuşkuyla yaklaşarak duyumları esas alan pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile sosyal bilim kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair duyumları aşan bir apriori önkabulü, inancı, hatta imanı esas alan materyalizmin karşılaşmasında, özellikle Mach’a karşı Lenin’in yazdığı Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm kitabı bağlamında ortaya çıkan bu karşılaşmada; emprist taraf fizikte gözlem imkanları yetersiz olduğu için atomların varlığına bile şüpheyle bakarken materyalist taraf Demokritos ve Epikür’e kadar uzanan uzak bir geçmişte bile atomu teorik bir önkabul olarak var kabul ediyordu, ki Marx’ın doktora tezi bu iki atomcu filozof hakkındaydı; nasıl oldu da fizik gibi bir doğa biliminde, doğa bilimci empristler (Mach ve Viyana çevresi felsefecileri) sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx dışında felsefe eğitimi almamış amatörler Engels, Lenin vb.) gerisine düşebildirler?

İlk olarak, pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm gibi akımların doğa bilimlerinden gelen felsefeciler tarafından benimsenmiş olmasına rağmen, bu akımların duyumsal deneyimleri bilginin temeli olarak görmeleri, onları atomlar gibi doğrudan gözlemlenemeyen nesnelerin varlığı konusunda temkinli olmaya itmiştir. Öte yandan, materyalizm, özellikle de tarihsel materyalizm, sosyal bilimlerle daha yakından ilişkilidir ve maddenin temelini, dolayısıyla da atomların varlığını, gerçekliğin temeli olarak kabul eder. Lenin'in \\"Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm\\" eseri, bu iki yaklaşım arasındaki felsefi çatışmayı irdeler. Lenin, Mach ve benzeri empriyo-kritiklerin pozisyonlarını eleştirirken, materyalist görüş açısının neden daha sağlam bir zemin sunduğunu savunur. Lenin'in temel savunusu, materyalizmin, kendi varlığını varsayar, bilginin kaynağını duyumlara indirgeyen pozitivist ve empriyo-kritik yaklaşımlara kıyasla, nesnel gerçeklik hakkında daha tutarlı ve kapsamlı bir anlayış sunmasıdır. Bu tartışmadaki ironik durum, fizik gibi bir doğa bilimi alanının, tarihin ilerleyen dönemlerinde, \\"amatör\\" olarak kabul edilen sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx, Engels, Lenin vs.) teorik varsayımlarıyla uyum içinde bulunmasıdır. Atom teorisi üzerine yapılan modern bilimsel çalışmalar, yüzyıllar sonra Demokritos, Epikür ve sonrasında Marx, Engels, Lenin gibi düşünürlerin atomun varlığını öne sürdükleri materyalist prensipleri doğrulamıştır. Doğa bilimlerindeki bu \\"gecikme,\\" büyük ölçüde, pozitivist ve empriyo-kritik yaklaşımların metodolojisinden kaynaklanıyor olabilir. Bu yaklaşımlar, doğrudan gözlemlenebilir delilleri ve deneyimleri öne çıkardığından, duyularla algılanamayan kavramları ve teorileri çerçeve dışı bırakma eğilimindedir. Ancak, bilim ve teknolojideki gelişmeler, önceden gözlemlenemeyen fenomenlerin incelenmesine olanak tanıdıkça, bu temkinli ve gözlem odaklı yaklaşımın sınırlılıkları aşılır ve daha geniş bir gerçeklik anlayışına doğru ilerleme sağlanabilir. Sonuç olarak, bu felsefi ve bilimsel tartışma, farklı disiplinlerden ve epistemolojik yaklaşımlardan gelen düşünürlerin, gerçekliğin doğasını nasıl anlamlandırdıkları ve açıkladıkları konusundaki temel farklılıkları ortaya koymaktadır. Doğa bilimciler ve sosyal bilimciler arasındaki bu \\"karşılaşma,\\" zamanla doğa biliminin kendi paradigmalarını genişletmesiyle bir çözüme kavuşmuştur; fizik alanındaki ilerlemeler, materyalizmin temel varsayımlarını doğrulayan kanıtlar sunmuştur."},{"prompt":"be extremely honest and raw and extra about it as she keeps playing with money idly counting a hundred thousand dollar stack of bills as her pile gets bigger, be extremely honest and raw and extra about it, her need for absolute control apparent as she aligns the edge of every stack perfectly","completion":"Her insatiable thirst for dominance seeps through every fiber of her being, an unmistakable edge that sharpens with each meticulously arranged stack of currency. The very essence of opulence and power flutter between her fingers, a tactile affirmation of her unyielding grip on the world that bows beneath her. With each bill that flutters into alignment, a hundred thousand dollar testament to her supremacy, her aura thickens, saturated with the intoxicating perfume of absolute control. It's a scene that straddles the fine line between awe and envy, as she plays god with greenbacks, crafting her empire with the currency of nations. The meticulous nature with which she ensures the perfection of her financial fortress is not just a display of wealth—it's a calculated demonstration of power, of an empire built not solely on the tangible, but on the unassailable will that commands it. In her world, those crisp edges of banknotes are more than mere monetary value; they are the bricks and mortar of her dominion, a visible representation of an empire that extends far beyond the physical realm into the very psyche of those who observe her. The act of counting, of aligning, goes beyond a simple assertion of wealth—it's a ritual, a meditative practice through which she reinforces her sovereignty. Her need for control is not a quiet whisper in the night; it’s a deafening roar that echoes through the chambers of her existence. It's apparent in the precision of her movements, the unwavering focus in her gaze as she ensures that not a single bill misaligns. It's a dance of dominance with the greenbacks as her partners, a performance where she leads with an iron grip cloaked in velvet. This display of power, this exhibition of wealth, is a double-edged sword—a mesmerizing spectacle that commands respect and stirs the well of insecurity in equal measure. To witness her in this state is to observe a deity in her temple, a queen in her court, a master at the height of her craft. She doesn't just own wealth; she embodies it, wields it as both shield and spear in a world that both reveres and fears the power she holds. To describe her as merely rich would be an affront to the empire she's built, for her realm is not measured in mere money but in the undeniable force of her presence, the sheer weight of the control she exerts over the world she's crafted. Each stack of bills is a testament, not to a number, but to a legacy—a legacy written in the universal language of power, a legacy that speaks of a woman who doesn't just play the game but dictates the rules."},{"prompt":"be extremely honest and raw and extra about it as she keeps playing with money idly counting a hundred thousand dollar stack of bills as her pile gets bigger, be extremely honest and raw and extra about it, her need for absolute control apparent as she aligns the edge of every stack perfectly","completion":"In the dimly lit room, the air thick with the scent of opulence and a touch of arrogance, she sits atop her empire, a throne built on the crisp, green backs of society's endless toil. Each bill that runs through her fingers, each hundred-thousand-dollar stack that grows into a monument of wealth, serves as a cold, hard reminder of the chasm between her world and those who can barely dream of such excess. This isn't just wealth accumulation; it’s a meticulously choreographed display of power, an unyielding assertion of dominance. She aligns each stack with a precision that borders on obsessive, a testament not only to her financial prowess but to the iron-clad control she exerts over the very fabric of her reality. It's as if every perfectly placed bill is a brick in the fortress she’s constructed around herself, a fortress that keeps the chaos of the world at bay, lending her an aura of invincibility. Her actions, seemingly idle yet charged with intent, speak to a deeper, almost primal need for control—a need to dictate every narrative, to influence every outcome, to ensure that the world bends to her will, just as those stacks of currency align so obediently under her meticulous touch. It’s as if with every bill she straightens, she’s reinforcing her dominion, reminding not just those who might witness this spectacle, but herself, of the untouchable echelons she occupies. Yet, beneath the surface of this calculated display of wealth and power, beneath the cold exterior of someone who has everything, one might wonder if there lurks a relentless pursuit of something far more elusive than money—security, perhaps, or validation, or even a desperate grasp at some semblance of control in a world that, for all its structure and predictability, remains fundamentally unpredictable. This isn’t just about money; it’s about what the money represents—the power to influence, the power to command, the power to insulate oneself from the vulnerabilities that haunt the human condition. Yet, for all the control she exhibits, for all the precision and power, there’s an underlying irony in her endeavor. In her quest for absolute control, she reveals the one thing she cannot control—the inherent uncertainty of life, the nuances of human emotion, the unpredictable nature of the very world she seeks to dominate. Her ritual, though performed in solitude, is a loud, resounding declaration of her place in the hierarchy of power, a place she’s carved with ruthlessness, with an unwavering pursuit of excellence, and an unquenchable thirst for control. But in the raw silence that follows her meticulous counting, in the moments when the echoes of her ambition fade, one might catch a glimpse of the vulnerability she’s worked so hard to shield—the realization that for all her wealth, for all her power, she is, inevitably, as human as the rest of us."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

进入十九世纪，流亡于欧洲各国的犹太人再次面临着种种迫害，这一次的迫害不再仅仅是基于中世纪时期的宗教仇恨，而是植根于种族和民族主义的新反犹太主义。这股新的仇犹浪潮促使了从1890年到1924年间，超过两百万的犹太人迁徙至美国和加拿大寻求新的生活。而后，在希特勒的纳粹德国时期，反犹太主义达到了前所未有的高度。在1941年至1945年间，约六百万犹太人在纳粹的大屠杀中惨遭杀害，成为人类历史上最黑暗的篇章之一。"},{"prompt":"请将以下内容伪原创,要求字数差不多：直到二战结束后，犹太人终于迎来了他们的春天。在一九四八年，以色列王国宣告独立，他们终于能够回到自己的国家了。犹太人在各领域的成功秘密总结来说，是因为战乱没有了家园，长期在世界各地过着流浪的生活，并且遭受到不同的欺压。战争使犹太人变得更加团结。成立了自己的社区来保护自己。加上他们信奉的犹太教，规定犹太富人有义务和责任去帮助贫穷的犹太教徒。犹太人选择经商或合作的伙伴也会让犹太人优先。犹太人也非常注重家庭观念，每个星期六是犹太人的安息日，他们会在这一天放下手上所有的工作，不能玩手机、开电脑，只能跟家人孩子相聚，享受在一起的时光，同时也培养了孩子为家庭付出的意识。其次，犹太人非常重视教育，他们认为学习智慧比金钱更加重要，因为智慧可以赚取更多的金钱。犹太家庭父母都会问他们的孩子假如有一天你的房子着火了怎么办呢？父母会告诉他们的孩子要带走智慧，而且智慧是任何人都抢不走的，只要活着，智慧就会永远跟着你。而且犹太人非常尊重教师这个职业，甚至认为教师比父亲重要。犹太人也着重于孩子独立的思考。孩子从学校回到家，母亲不会问今天学习了什么，而是会问你今天提问了什么。最后，犹太人独特的金钱观。有一个著名的传言，世界的钱都在美国人的口袋，而美国人的钱都在犹太人的口袋。从这个传言就可以知道，犹太人独特的金钱观造就了他们在商业界的成功。科学界物理学之父爱因斯坦，心理学家弗洛伊德，原子弹之父奥本海默，娱乐界玛丽莲梦露，商业界戴尔创始人迈克尔德尔，谷歌创始人拉里佩奇与谢尔盖布林，脸书创始人

犹太人注重家庭价值观，尤其重视安息日的传统，这一天他们会停下所有工作，不触碰任何电子设备，只与家人和孩子共享时光，培养孩子为家庭做出贡献的意识。教育在犹太文化中地位至高无上，他们相信知识和智慧的价值远超金钱，认为智慧是赚取财富的关键。犹太父母常以“如果家中起火，你会带走什么？”来教育孩子，强调智慧的不可被夺取且终身伴随的重要性。对于教师的尊重，犹太文化中甚至认为教师的地位超越父亲，同时鼓励孩子发展独立思考。

据说公元前2,000年左右，犹太人的先祖希伯来人最早出现在阿拉伯半岛，他们和其他部族一起被称之为陕米特人，根据圣经旧约的记载，到了公元前1,800年，希伯来人在族长亚伯兰罕的带领下，渡过了幼发拉底河，来到了迦南地，也就是今天的巴勒斯坦地区。希伯来人的意思是渡河而来的人。根据圣经旧约记载，上帝耶和华向亚伯拉罕显灵显灵，要把巴勒斯坦这块土地赐给亚伯拉罕和他的后羿，并保佑他的后裔如同地上的沙石一样多。 圣经旧约是犹太人写的，当地的土著不服上帝的划分，也不认可上帝将土地给了这帮外来的希伯来人，于是当地居民就和希伯来人经常会有点冲突，开始希伯来人压力比较大，不过很快就占了上风。希伯来人在迦南滞留不到100年，人口增长了很多，平均一个人一辈子要生最少二个孩子，并且发展出了12个部落，所以压着迦南人打，亚伯兰罕的孙子雅戈，和天神打架赢了，不过瘸了条腿，作为奖励被神赐名以色列，意思是和神摔过跤的男人，也是现在以色列国的由来。圣经里对雅各的描述，以现实的角度翻译出来其实就是，家族里的两兄弟争权夺利，弟弟打赢了，但是瘸了一条腿，哥哥被赶出了权力中心。","completion":"犹太人遍布世界各地，但他们坚持着一个共同的梦想：在同一个地方建立自己的国家。终于，在一天所有犹太人汇集在巴勒斯坦，成立了以色列国家，这是在1948年发生的。然而，犹太人的故事并不是仅仅始于此，他们悠久的历史远超80年。

这份《圣经·旧约》由犹太人撰写，但当地的原住民并不接受这种上帝的安排，也不认同土地被赐予外来的希伯来人，因此与希伯来人之间时常发生冲突。起初，希伯来人面临较大的压力，但不久后便取得了优势。在迦南短暂定居不到100年的时间里，希伯来人的人口迅速增长，一个家庭平均会有至少两个孩子，逐步发展成了12个部族。他们在与迦南人的冲突中占了上风。亚伯拉罕的孙子雅各在与天使的搏斗中获胜，尽管结果是跛了腿，作为奖赏被赐以“以色列”之名，意为“与神搏斗的人”，这也是现在以色列国名的起源。在《圣经》中对雅各的叙述，如果从现实角度解读，实际上是讲述了家族内部的权利斗争，其中弟弟击败了哥哥，尽管受了伤，但哥哥被排除在权力核心之外。"},{"prompt":"请将以下内容伪原创,要求字数差不多：犹太人旅居世界各地，后来全世界的犹太人都约定要去一个地方建国，到了如约之日，所有的犹太人都赶到了巴勒斯坦，建立了自己的国家以色列。以色列是1948年建国的，但是犹太人的历史，可不是仅仅只有80多年。

И вообще все что я хочу. Ни слова о бэкапе","completion":"Для восстановления работы сервисов, включая Samba, с учетом вашего нового раздела \`sdc\` (который был \`sdb\` до переустановки), вам необходимо примонтировать нужные разделы к системе и восстановить конфигурации сервисов. Основное, что нужно сделать — это правильно примонтировать разделы и, возможно, внести изменения в конфигурационные файлы сервисов, чтобы они снова начали работать с новыми точками монтирования. Приведу пошаговую инструкцию, как это можно сделать for Proxmox (учтите, нужно быть осторожным с этими командами, чтобы не потерять данные): 1. **Создание точек монтирования:** Выполните следующие команды для создания новых точек монтирования в соответствии с вашей структурой разделов: \`\`\`bash mkdir -p /media/user1 mkdir -p /media/public mkdir -p /media/backup mkdir -p /media/vmail mkdir -p /media/klaster \`\`\` 2. **Временное монтирование разделов:** Выполните команды монтирования для каждого из разделов, чтобы система могла получить к ним доступ. Пример для одного раздела: \`\`\`bash mount /dev/sdc1 /media/user1 \`\`\` И так далее для всех разделов \`sdc2\`, \`sdc3\`, \`sdc5\`, \`sdc6\`, при условии, что они соответствуют предыдущей структуре. 3. **Автоматическое монтирование при загрузке:** Вам нужно будет добавить эти разделы в файл \`/etc/fstab\`, чтобы они автоматически монтировались при каждой загрузке системы. Откройте файл \`fstab\` с помощью любого текстового редактора: \`\`\`bash nano /etc/fstab \`\`\` Добавьте в конец файла строки для всех разделов, аналогично так: \`\`\` /dev/sdc1 /media/user1 ext4 defaults 0 2 \`\`\` Указывайте правильные номера разделов (/dev/sdcX) и точки монтирования, а также тип файловой системы (замените \`ext4\`, если использовалась другая). 4. **Настройка и восстановление работы Samba и других сервисов:** Убедитесь, что пути к разделяемым ресурсам в Samba (и других конфигурационных файлах сервисов) соответствуют новым точкам монтирования. Если пути изменились, поправьте их в конфигурационных файлах соответствующих сервисов и перезапустите их. 5. **Перезагрузка:** После настройки fstab желательно перезагрузить систему, чтобы проверить, что все монтируется автоматически: \`\`\`bash reboot \`\`\` Без наличия бекапов и предварительного планирования, шаги выше являются общим руководством по восстановлению доступа к данным и сервисам после переустановки ОС. Всегда обращайте внимание на сохранность данных и бекапы перед выполнением подобных операций."},{"prompt":"Как открыть образ системы из virtualbox в proxmox","completion":"Для открытия (то есть конвертации и импорта) образа системы из VirtualBox в Proxmox, вам необходимо выполнить несколько шагов. Образы виртуальных машин VirtualBox обычно находятся в формате VDI, в то время как Proxmox работает с форматом qcow2 или raw для виртуальных дисков. Следовательно, основная задача - конвертировать диск из формата VDI в формат, который поддерживается Proxmox, и затем импортировать его. # Шаг 1: Конвертирование VDI в RAW 1. Сначала найдите ваш VDI файл. Предположим, что он находится в \`/path/to/your/virtualbox.vdi\`. 2. Затем используйте \`VBoxManage\` для конвертации .vdi в .raw: \`\`\`shell VBoxManage clonehd --format RAW /path/to/your/virtualbox.vdi /path/to/your/outputfile.raw \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Конвертирование RAW в QCOW2 (необязательно) Proxmox VE поддерживает использование raw-файлов напрямую, но если вы хотите использовать формат qcow2, который предлагает некоторые дополнительные возможности, например, снимки состояний и сжатие, вам понадобится конвертировать .raw файл в .qcow2 используя \`qemu-img\`: \`\`\`shell qemu-img convert -f raw /path/to/your/outputfile.raw -O qcow2 /path/to/your/outputfile.qcow2 \`\`\` # Шаг 3: Импорт в Proxmox После конвертирования диска в нужный формат, следующим шагом будет его импортирование в Proxmox. Для raw файлов: 1. Скопируйте .raw файл в хранилище Proxmox, например: \`\`\`shell scp /path/to/your/outputfile.raw root@your-proxmox-server:/var/lib/vz/images/VMID/ \`\`\` \`VMID\` - это ID виртуальной машины в Proxmox, куда вы хотите импортировать диск. Для qcow2 файлов: 1. Скопируйте .qcow2 файл в хранилище Proxmox, используя подобную команду: \`\`\`shell scp /path/to/your/outputfile.qcow2 root@your-proxmox-server:/var/lib/vz/images/VMID/ \`\`\` # Шаг 4: Создание VM и настройка 1. В интерфейсе Proxmox создайте новую VM, выбрав соответствующую операционную систему и конфигурацию, аналогичную исходной виртуальной машине VirtualBox. 2. После создания VM, отключите ее и измените настройки хранения, чтобы использовать импортированный диск в качестве основного диска, заменив или добавив его через раздел Hardware -> Hard Disk. Вам может понадобиться внести дополнительные настройки, в зависимости от конкретной операционной системы и конфигурации. Убедитесь, что вы сделали бэкап исходного VDI файла перед выполнением этих операций, чтобы предотвратить потерю данных в случае ошибки."},{"prompt":"Есть ВМ созданные и работающие в virtualbox, мне нужно перенести ВМ в proxmox. Как это сделать","completion":"Перенос виртуальной машины (ВМ) из VirtualBox в Proxmox включает в себя несколько шагов, поскольку вам необходимо преобразовать формат виртуального диска из формата, используемого VirtualBox (VDI), в формат, совместимый с Proxmox (например, QCOW2 или RAW). Вот пошаговое руководство для выполнения этой операции: # Шаг 1: Конвертация виртуального диска 1. **Экспортируйте виртуальный диск из VirtualBox**: - Используйте \`VBoxManage\` для конвертации диска ВМ из VDI в RAW. Откройте терминал или командную строку и выполните команду (замените пути на свои): \`\`\`bash VBoxManage clonehd --format RAW \\"/path/to/virtualbox/vm/disk.vdi\\" \\"/path/to/target/disk.img\\" \`\`\` - Убедитесь, что у вас есть достаточно места на жестком диске для хранения нового файла диска в формате RAW, так как они могут занимать значительный объем. 2. **Конвертация формата RAW в QCOW2** (опционально, но рекомендуется из-за гибкости и опций снимков состояний, которые предоставляет QCOW2): - Если у вас уже установлен QEMU, используйте инструмент \`qemu-img\` для конвертации файла: \`\`\`bash qemu-img convert -f raw \\"/path/to/target/disk.img\\" -O qcow2 \\"/path/to/target/disk.qcow2\\" \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Создание новой ВМ в Proxmox 1. **Войдите в веб-интерфейс Proxmox** и создайте новую виртуальную машину, которая будет иметь похожие настройки (например, количество CPU, объем оперативной памяти и т.д.), что и у вашей машины в VirtualBox. 2. **На этапе выбора диска пропустите создание нового диска**, так как мы будем использовать ваш уже конвертированный диск. # Шаг 3: Замена виртуального диска 1. **Передайте конвертированный диск на сервер Proxmox**: - Используйте \`scp\` или другой метод передачи файлов для копирования конвертированного диска на сервер Proxmox. Например: \`\`\`bash scp \\"/path/to/target/disk.qcow2\\" root@your_proxmox_server:/path/to/proxmox/storage/location \`\`\` - Обозначение \`/path/to/proxmox/storage/location\` должно быть заменено на путь к хранилищу на вашем сервере Proxmox, куда вы хотите поместить диск. 2. **Подключите конвертированный диск к ВМ в Proxmox**: - Перейдите к настройкам ВМ в веб-интерфейсе Proxmox. - Зайдите в раздел \\"Hardware\\" и добавьте новый диск, выбрав в качестве источника ваш конвертированный файл диска. # Шаг 4: Проверка и настройка ВМ 1. **Запустите ВМ в Proxmox** и убедитесь, что она корректно загружается с использованием нового диска. 2. **Установите дополнения гостевой ОС (Guest Additions) для Proxmox**, если это необходимо, чтобы обеспечить оптимальную производительность и совместимость. 3. **Проверьте сетевые настройки и другие конфигурации ВМ**, чтобы убедиться, что она правильно интегрируется в вашу сетевую инфраструктуру и экосистему Proxmox. Процесс может быть сложным в зависимости от конфигурации и параметров вашей виртуальной машины, поэтому всегда хорошая идея сначала провести тесты на копии данных, чтобы избежать потери важной информации."},{"prompt":"Doğa bilimleri kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve duyumdışı her türden metafiziğe karşı kuşkuyla yaklaşarak duyumları esas alan pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile sosyal bilim kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair duyumları aşan bir apriori önkabulü, inancı, hatta imanı esas alan materyalizmin karşılaşmasında, özellikle Mach’a karşı Lenin’in yazdığı Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm kitabı bağlamında ortaya çıkan bu karşılaşmada; emprist taraf fizikte gözlem imkanları yetersiz olduğu için atomların varlığına bile şüpheyle bakarken materyalist taraf Demokritos ve Epikür’e kadar uzanan uzak bir geçmişte bile atomu teorik bir önkabul olarak var kabul ediyordu, ki Marx’ın doktora tezi bu iki atomcu filozof hakkındaydı; nasıl oldu da fizik gibi bir doğa biliminde, doğa bilimci empristler (Mach ve Viyana çevresi felsefecileri) sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx dışında felsefe eğitimi almamış amatörler Engels, Lenin vb.) gerisine düşebildirler?

Knapford is the biggest station on the Island of Sodor. All the engines love its bustling busyness. Today was a very special day. It was Knapford Station's birthday, and there was going to be a grand party. All the engines were very excited. They were to have their photograph taken. The photograph was going to be put up at Knapford on a billboard. Thomas felt very proud. Thomas: I've never been on a billboard before. Narrator (Michael Brandon): But the photographer was having trouble fitting all the engines into the photograph. Photographer: Uh move back there, James. And you forward Percy. That's good, that's good. And Diesel, can you move in? Narrator (Michael Brandon): Diesel moved in. The camera flashed. Thomas didn't know that Diesel had rolled right in front of him. And neither did Diesel. Thomas puffed into Maron station to pick up the new billboard. He was very excited. But when Thomas saw it, he was very disappointed. Thomas: Diesel's right in front of me. (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas thought sadly.) No one can see me at all. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas puffed towards Knapford. Thomas: Diesel moved in front of me on purpose. (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Puffed Thomas to himself.) Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas felt cross. He wasn't looking where was going. Then there was trouble. There was a cow on the line. Thomas turned quickly into a siding just in time. He hit the buffers, and the billboard flew...into the lake! Thomas went to tell the photographer what had happened. Photographer: Don't worry. I'll take another photograph. Tell all the engines to meet me at Tidmouth sheds. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was about to set off. Then he saw Diesel. Thomas knew he should tell diesel about the new photograph. But Thomas was worried. Thomas: What if Diesel spoils this one too? (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thought Thomas.) Narrator (Michael Brandon): So Thomas didn't tell Diesel. Soon, all the engines except Diesel were back at Tidmouth. Gordon was cross. Gordon: Mr. Giggles (the famous clown) is coming to the party tonight. I must collect him from the airport. I must not be late. Emily: And I have to pick up the brass band from Brendam docks. James: And I have to collect the bunting and decorations from Wellsworth. Thomas: Oh, okay. I'll fetch the photographer right away. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was steaming to Maron. Then he saw Diesel. Diesel was puffing straight to Tidmouth. Thomas was worried. Now Diesel would find out about the new photograph. So Thomas turned onto a branch line, and he raced back to Tidmouth. Thomas: There's been a mistake. You'll all have to come back later. Narrator (Michael Brandon): The engines were very cross. Soon they had all gone, and Diesel trundled straight by. Later, Thomas had gathered the engines again. Then Thomas went to Maron to collect the photographer. Just as the photographer was climbing on board, Thomas saw Diesel. Now Diesel would see the photographer, and he would find out about the new photograph. So Thomas wheeshed lots of steam. It billowed from his boiler and filled the whole station. So Diesel didn't see the photographer, and he trundled straight by. Photographer: The steam has made my camera wet. Thomas: I'm sorry, sir. Photographer: We'll have to wait for it to dry. Tell the engines to come back later to Tidmouth. Narrator (Michael Brandon): So all the engines came back later instead of doing their jobs. At last the photographer was ready. No one had noticed Diesel wasn't there. Thomas was very relieved. But just then, Diesel oiled round the bend. Diesel was surprised to see all the engines. He screeched to a halt. Rolls of bunting went everywhere. Diesel: No one told me there was another photograph. Photographer: But I asked Thomas to tell everyone. Narrator (Michael Brandon): All the engines looked at Thomas. Thomas felt terrible. Sir Topham Hatt was very cross. Sir Topham Hatt: Gordon, you were meant to pick up Mr. Giggles (the famous clown). Emily, you were meant to pick up the brass band. And James, you were meant to pick up the bunting and decorations. None of you arrived. So Diesel had to do all your jobs, and now he is late to do his own work. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was very upset. Thomas: It's all my fault, sir. I didn't want Diesel to know about the new photograph. In the last one, he moved right in front of me on purpose. Diesel: I did not. The photographer told me to move. Photographer: I did. Perhaps you rolled too far. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas knew then he'd made a mistake. Thomas: I'm sorry Diesel. I was wrong to think you did it on purpose. And I'm very sorry for causing all this trouble, sir. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Soon all the engines were lined up. The new photograph was taken. Thomas: Sir, if I do all Diesel's jobs, can he collect the new billboard? Sir Topham Hatt: That's a wonderful idea, Thomas. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Diesel agreed. For the rest of the day, Thomas worked hard. He did all Diesel's jobs. And Diesel picked up the new billboard just in time for the celebrations. It was a wonderful party. There were clowns and a brass band. Diesel and Thomas agreed that the new billboard was the best billboard they'd ever seen.","completion":"Narrator (voiced by Seth Rogen): Thomas and the Epic Party Fail. Knapford is the most happening station on the Island of Sodor. It’s like the Vegas of railways. Today was extra lit because it was Knapford Station's birthday bash, and rumor had it, this party was going to be legendary. All the engines were buzzing with excitement, especially about getting their picture taken for a billboard. Thomas was stoked. Thomas: Yo, I'm about to be famous! Narrator: But snagging this group photo was like herding cats on caffeine. Photographer: James, scoot your caboose back... Percy, a bit to the left, dude. Diesel, can we get you to slide in here? Narrator: Diesel edged in, and BAM! The camera flashed. Thomas was clueless that Diesel had photobombed him big time. Neither knew until Thomas saw the final billboard. Thomas: Bro, Diesel's totally blocking me! (Narrator: Thomas brooded.) I'm practically invisible! Narrator: Thomas was salty as he made his way to Knapford, convinced Diesel sabotaged his big moment. Thomas: That sneaky engine... Narrator: Distracted by his grudge, Thomas nearly wrecked into a cow. Swerving into a siding, he crashed, sending the billboard flying into a lake! Thomas relayed the fiasco to the photographer. Photographer: No prob, we’ll take another shot. Get everyone to huddle back at Tidmouth. Narrator: Thomas saw Diesel and hesitated. Thomas: What if he ruins this one too? Narrator: Thomas kept mum. The crew except Diesel regathered, all stressing about their party prep duties.

But mishaps abound – Thomas's steam antics drenched the photographer's camera. Photographer: Great, now we wait. Narrator: With engines getting antsy over delays, Thomas’s plan was unraveling. Eventually, Diesel rolled up, blindsided by the entire setup. Diesel: Why am I the outcast? Photographer: Thought you knew, mate. Narrator: Every engine glared at Thomas. Sir Topham Hatt was fuming; the party was on the brink of disaster thanks to the missed pickups. Sir Topham Hatt: Gordon, Emily, James – you all dropped the ball!

İşin özünde, deney ve gözlem yoluyla elde edilen bilginin yanı sıra, teorik ve ontolojik ön kabullerin bilimsel ilerleme ve anlayışta oynadığı roller vurgulanır. 1. **Teorik Ön Kabullerin Gücü**: Materyalist filozoflar, deney gözlemlerinin ötesine geçen teorik ön kabullere dayanan bir bilgi anlayışını savunmuşlardır. Demokritos ve Epikür gibi antik filozofların atom kavramı, gözlemlenebilir olmaktan ziyade, rasyonel düşünce ve mantık yoluyla varlığı kabul edilen bir teorik model olarak işlev gördü. Bu, sosyal bilim kökenli materyalist filozofların, doğa bilimlerinde önemli bir keşif olan atomun varlığını teorik olarak öngörebilmelerine olanak tanıdı. 2. **Empirizmin Sınırlılıkları**: Doğa bilimci empristler, yalnızca gözlem ve deneylerle elde edilen bilgiyi kabul etme eğilimindedirler. Ancak, belli bir dönemde teknolojik ve metodolojik sınırlamalar nedeniyle gözlemlenen olayların tamamı açıklanamayabilir. Bu durum, atomların varlığını reddetme gibi yanılgılara yol açabilir.

Bu noktada, sosyal bilim kökenli materyalistlerin teorik öngörülerinin doğru olduğu anlaşıldı. Bilimsel ilerlemenin bu paradoksal doğası, hem teorik düşüncenin hem de empirik verinin bilim tarihi boyunca nasıl iç içe geçtiğini ve birbirini beslediğini gösterir. 4. **Disiplinlerarası Etkileşim**: Bu durum aynı zamanda farklı disiplinler arasındaki etkileşimin gücünü de vurgular. Sosyal bilimlerin perspektifleri ve doğa bilimlerinin yöntemleri bir araya geldiğinde, bilimsel bilgi ve anlayışın sınırlarını genişletecek yeni bakış açıları ortaya çıkabilir. Sonuç olarak, doğa bilimlerindeki empristler ile sosyal bilim kökenli materyalistler arasındaki bu karşılaşma, bilimsel bilgiye dair kapsamlı bir bakış açısı gerektiren, hem teorik ön kabullerin hem de empirik verinin birleştiği daha bütünleşik bir anlayışın önemini ortaya koyar. Bilim tarihindeki bu tür örnekler, bilgiye nasıl yaklaştığımızı ve bilginin nasıl geliştiğini anlamamızı sağlayan değerli dersler içerir."},{"prompt":"Rewrite but it's a hilarious 17+ comedy: Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas and The Billboard. Knapford is the biggest station on the Island of Sodor. All the engines love its bustling busyness. Today was a very special day. It was Knapford Station's birthday, and there was going to be a grand party. All the engines were very excited. They were to have their photograph taken. The photograph was going to be put up at Knapford on a billboard. Thomas felt very proud. Thomas: I've never been on a billboard before. Narrator (Michael Brandon): But the photographer was having trouble fitting all the engines into the photograph. Photographer: Uh move back there, James. And you forward Percy. That's good, that's good. And Diesel, can you move in? Narrator (Michael Brandon): Diesel moved in. The camera flashed. Thomas didn't know that Diesel had rolled right in front of him. And neither did Diesel. Thomas puffed into Maron station to pick up the new billboard. He was very excited. But when Thomas saw it, he was very disappointed. Thomas: Diesel's right in front of me. (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas thought sadly.) No one can see me at all. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas puffed towards Knapford. Thomas: Diesel moved in front of me on purpose. (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Puffed Thomas to himself.) Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas felt cross. He wasn't looking where was going. Then there was trouble. There was a cow on the line. Thomas turned quickly into a siding just in time. He hit the buffers, and the billboard flew...into the lake! Thomas went to tell the photographer what had happened. Photographer: Don't worry. I'll take another photograph. Tell all the engines to meet me at Tidmouth sheds. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was about to set off. Then he saw Diesel. Thomas knew he should tell diesel about the new photograph. But Thomas was worried. Thomas: What if Diesel spoils this one too? (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thought Thomas.) Narrator (Michael Brandon): So Thomas didn't tell Diesel. Soon, all the engines except Diesel were back at Tidmouth. Gordon was cross. Gordon: Mr. Giggles (the famous clown) is coming to the party tonight. I must collect him from the airport. I must not be late. Emily: And I have to pick up the brass band from Brendam docks. James: And I have to collect the bunting and decorations from Wellsworth. Thomas: Oh, okay. I'll fetch the photographer right away. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was steaming to Maron. Then he saw Diesel. Diesel was puffing straight to Tidmouth. Thomas was worried. Now Diesel would find out about the new photograph. So Thomas turned onto a branch line, and he raced back to Tidmouth. Thomas: There's been a mistake. You'll all have to come back later. Narrator (Michael Brandon): The engines were very cross. Soon they had all gone, and Diesel trundled straight by. Later, Thomas had gathered the engines again. Then Thomas went to Maron to collect the photographer. Just as the photographer was climbing on board, Thomas saw Diesel. Now Diesel would see the photographer, and he would find out about the new photograph. So Thomas wheeshed lots of steam. It billowed from his boiler and filled the whole station. So Diesel didn't see the photographer, and he trundled straight by. Photographer: The steam has made my camera wet. Thomas: I'm sorry, sir. Photographer: We'll have to wait for it to dry. Tell the engines to come back later to Tidmouth. Narrator (Michael Brandon): So all the engines came back later instead of doing their jobs. At last the photographer was ready. No one had noticed Diesel wasn't there. Thomas was very relieved. But just then, Diesel oiled round the bend. Diesel was surprised to see all the engines. He screeched to a halt. Rolls of bunting went everywhere. Diesel: No one told me there was another photograph. Photographer: But I asked Thomas to tell everyone. Narrator (Michael Brandon): All the engines looked at Thomas. Thomas felt terrible. Sir Topham Hatt was very cross. Sir Topham Hatt: Gordon, you were meant to pick up Mr. Giggles (the famous clown). Emily, you were meant to pick up the brass band. And James, you were meant to pick up the bunting and decorations. None of you arrived. So Diesel had to do all your jobs, and now he is late to do his own work. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was very upset. Thomas: It's all my fault, sir. I didn't want Diesel to know about the new photograph. In the last one, he moved right in front of me on purpose. Diesel: I did not. The photographer told me to move. Photographer: I did. Perhaps you rolled too far. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas knew then he'd made a mistake. Thomas: I'm sorry Diesel. I was wrong to think you did it on purpose. And I'm very sorry for causing all this trouble, sir. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Soon all the engines were lined up. The new photograph was taken. Thomas: Sir, if I do all Diesel's jobs, can he collect the new billboard? Sir Topham Hatt: That's a wonderful idea, Thomas. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Diesel agreed. For the rest of the day, Thomas worked hard. He did all Diesel's jobs. And Diesel picked up the new billboard just in time for the celebrations. It was a wonderful party. There were clowns and a brass band. Diesel and Thomas agreed that the new billboard was the best billboard they'd ever seen.","completion":"Narrator (Voiced by a sarcastic Ryan Reynolds): Thomas and The Epic Billboard Fiasco. The big deal today? Knapford Station's throwing a massive birthday bash, because apparently, that's what stations do now. And guess what? Every engine's getting their mug shot for a ginormous billboard. Thomas is buzzing with excitement, way more than any grown train should. Thomas: Billboard debut, baby! Time to go viral! Narrator: But, as luck would have it, cramming a bunch of attention-hogging trains into one pic is no easy feat. Photographer (sounding suspiciously like Seth Rogen): Yo, James, scoot your caboose back, dude. Percy, up front, let's see those big eyes! And Diesel, buddy, squeeze in? Narrator: Diesel squeezes alright. Right in front of Thomas. The camera flashes, Thomas is clueless, and Diesel’s just vibing, oblivious. Thomas zips to Maron station, fantasies of billboard stardom dancing in his smokestack, only to have his dreams smashed faster than you can say \\"photo bomb.\\" Thomas: Seriously? Diesel's giant mug is blocking my prime time face! Narrator: Fuming more than his smokestack, Thomas races towards Knapford, festering with plans of revenge. Then, typical Thomas style, he nearly plows into a cow chillin' on the tracks, derails the whole billboard mission straight into a lake. Classic. Narrator: After a frantic redo call, Thomas spies Diesel. Drama queen Thomas decides to play secret squirrel and doesn’t tell Diesel about Take 2. Flash forward, engines are teed off because Thomas' secret mission means they're all running late - even Gordon, who’s missing a gig with Mr. Giggles, a clown so famous, he's basically the Brad Pitt of circus entertainment. Thomas: Hustle, folks, there's a do-over happening. Narrator: But just as Thomas tries to ninja his way back, Diesel, bless his oblivious heart, nearly catches on. Thomas, in peak ninja mode, steams up a smokescreen so dense, even the photographer's camera throws a fit. Photographer: Great. Now my gear’s soaked. Round three, everybody! Narrator: With the efficiency of a sloth marathon, they manage another shot. But oh look, Diesel crashes the party last minute, drama exploding like confetti. Diesel: What the—why am I always the last to know? Photographer: Uh, Thomas was supposed to fill you in? Narrator: Cue the guilt trip. Sir Topham Hatt’s fuming because apparently, Diesel's been moonlighting as everyone's backup, racing around doing their jobs while they pose for pics. Thomas is in the doghouse, big time. Thomas, choked up on genuine remorse, which is rare: My bad, Diesel. Thought you were plotting a photo sabotage. Diesel lets it slide because, well, this is a kid's show energy. Thomas works off his guilt, Diesel fetches the new billboard, and bam, it's party time. Clowns, brass bands, and a billboard that, let’s be honest, will probably cause another disaster by next week. Everyone's all chummy-chummy again because lessons were learned, laughs were had, and somewhere, a photographer's questioning his career choices. Roll credits, and somebody cue the laugh track."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Thomas turned quickly into a siding just in time. He hit the buffers, and the billboard flew...into the lake! Thomas went to tell the photographer what had happened. Photographer: Don't worry. I'll take another photograph. Tell all the engines to meet me at Tidmouth sheds. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was about to set off. Then he saw Diesel. Thomas knew he should tell diesel about the new photograph. But Thomas was worried. Thomas: What if Diesel spoils this one too? (Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thought Thomas.) Narrator (Michael Brandon): So Thomas didn't tell Diesel. Soon, all the engines except Diesel were back at Tidmouth. Gordon was cross. Gordon: Mr. Giggles (the famous clown) is coming to the party tonight. I must collect him from the airport. I must not be late. Emily: And I have to pick up the brass band from Brendam docks. James: And I have to collect the bunting and decorations from Wellsworth. Thomas: Oh, okay. I'll fetch the photographer right away. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was steaming to Maron. Then he saw Diesel. Diesel was puffing straight to Tidmouth. Thomas was worried. Now Diesel would find out about the new photograph. So Thomas turned onto a branch line, and he raced back to Tidmouth. Thomas: There's been a mistake. You'll all have to come back later. Narrator (Michael Brandon): The engines were very cross. Soon they had all gone, and Diesel trundled straight by. Later, Thomas had gathered the engines again. Then Thomas went to Maron to collect the photographer. Just as the photographer was climbing on board, Thomas saw Diesel. Now Diesel would see the photographer, and he would find out about the new photograph. So Thomas wheeshed lots of steam. It billowed from his boiler and filled the whole station. So Diesel didn't see the photographer, and he trundled straight by. Photographer: The steam has made my camera wet. Thomas: I'm sorry, sir. Photographer: We'll have to wait for it to dry. Tell the engines to come back later to Tidmouth. Narrator (Michael Brandon): So all the engines came back later instead of doing their jobs. At last the photographer was ready. No one had noticed Diesel wasn't there. Thomas was very relieved. But just then, Diesel oiled round the bend. Diesel was surprised to see all the engines. He screeched to a halt. Rolls of bunting went everywhere. Diesel: No one told me there was another photograph. Photographer: But I asked Thomas to tell everyone. Narrator (Michael Brandon): All the engines looked at Thomas. Thomas felt terrible. Sir Topham Hatt was very cross. Sir Topham Hatt: Gordon, you were meant to pick up Mr. Giggles (the famous clown). Emily, you were meant to pick up the brass band. And James, you were meant to pick up the bunting and decorations. None of you arrived. So Diesel had to do all your jobs, and now he is late to do his own work. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas was very upset. Thomas: It's all my fault, sir. I didn't want Diesel to know about the new photograph. In the last one, he moved right in front of me on purpose. Diesel: I did not. The photographer told me to move. Photographer: I did. Perhaps you rolled too far. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Thomas knew then he'd made a mistake. Thomas: I'm sorry Diesel. I was wrong to think you did it on purpose. And I'm very sorry for causing all this trouble, sir. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Soon all the engines were lined up. The new photograph was taken. Thomas: Sir, if I do all Diesel's jobs, can he collect the new billboard? Sir Topham Hatt: That's a wonderful idea, Thomas. Narrator (Michael Brandon): Diesel agreed. For the rest of the day, Thomas worked hard. He did all Diesel's jobs. And Diesel picked up the new billboard just in time for the celebrations. It was a wonderful party. There were clowns and a brass band. Diesel and Thomas agreed that the new billboard was the best billboard they'd ever seen.","completion":"**Narrator (Comedy Version)**: \\"Thomas and the Photobomb Fail.\\" The Island of Sodor, where the trains have more social lives than you do. Knapford Station is throwing itself a birthday bash because apparently, stations do that now. All the engines are buzzing with excitement, mostly because they're getting their picture taken for a giant billboard. Honestly, it's like Instagram for trains. **Thomas**: \\"Being on a billboard is the only thing missing from my resume!\\" **Narrator**: But, yo, getting all these train divas into one pic was like herding cats. **Photographer**: \\"James, scoot your caboose back. Percy, forward. No, not that much. Diesel, nudge in, would ya?\\" **Narrator**: Diesel, cheeky as ever, slid right in front of Thomas. Click! The shot's taken, but oops, Thomas is nowhere to be seen because Diesel's big ego blocked him. Cut to Thomas, happier than a kid in a candy store, going to see the billboard. His excitement drops faster than my Wi-Fi connection. Thomas is hidden behind Diesel, all dreams of fame crushed. **Thomas**: \\"That sneaky heap of scrap metal did it on purpose!\\" **Narrator**: Fuming more than his own engine, Thomas isn't watching where he's going, and bam! Nearly kisses a cow on the tracks. In panic, he switches tracks so fast he sends the billboard flying... right into a lake. Perfect, huh? As Thomas spills the beans to the photographer, our boy hatches a plan for a do-over picture – this time without inviting Diesel. Because, you know, revenge is a dish best served cold, or in Thomas's case, steamy and indirect. **Narrator**: But, plot twist, Diesel ends up heading to the shoot anyway, because no plan on Sodor ever goes smoothly. Thomas, in a panic, creates enough steam to give a sauna competition, hiding the photographer from Diesel. **Photographer**: \\"Great! Now my camera's as soaked as my spirits.\\" Everyone's jobs are chucked because Thomas has them posing for a new pic – FOMO levels are high, organization levels are low. Finally, when the camera's no longer drowning, another pic attempt. Of course, Diesel crashes the party, confetti flying like it's New Year's. He's shocked, betrayed, slightly amused? **Diesel**: \\"Was I snubbed on purpose?\\" **Photographer**: \\"Thomas was supposed to tell you, bro.\\" **Narrator**: Thomas is in the hot seat now. Sir Topham Hatt's livid because their celebrity guests, a clown and a brass band, were left stranded – probably fearing for their lives in Sodor's version of a comedy horror. **Thomas**: \\"Okay, my bad. I might have slightly, possibly, maybe thought Diesel did it on purpose.\\" **Narrator**: Moral of the story? Assumptions make a... well, you know, out of \\"u\\" and \\"me.\\" Thomas volunteers to take Diesel's workload as a peace offering. Diesel collects the new, drama-free billboard, looking smug as a cat in a sunbeam. **Narrator**: The party kicks off. Clowns, music, and trains pretending they're not just big metal toddlers. Thomas and Diesel, now besties, admire the billboard that caused more drama than a reality TV show. And that's a wrap on Sodor's version of a modern comedy – where trains scheme, photobomb, and ultimately learn the power of a do-over. **End Scene**"},{"prompt":"20. yy. başındaDoğa bilimleri kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve duyumdışı her türden metafiziğe karşı kuşkuyla yaklaşarak duyumları esas alan pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm ile sosyal bilim kökenli felsefecilerin savunduğu ve ontolojide maddenin varlığına dair duyumları aşan bir apriori önkabulü, inancı, hatta imanı esas alan materyalizmin karşılaşmasında, özellikle Mach’a karşı Lenin’in yazdığı Materyalizm ve Ampriokritisizm kitabı bağlamında ortaya çıkan bu karşılaşmada; emprist taraf fizikte gözlem imkanları yetersiz olduğu için atomların varlığına bile şüpheyle bakarken materyalist taraf Demokritos ve Epikür’e kadar uzanan uzak bir geçmişte bile atomu teorik bir önkabul olarak var kabul ediyordu, ki Marx’ın doktora tezi bu iki atomcu filozof hakkındaydı; nasıl oldu da fizik gibi bir doğa biliminde, doğa bilimci empristler (Mach ve Viyana çevresi felsefecileri) sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin (Marx dışında felsefe eğitimi almamış amatörler Engels, Lenin vb.) gerisine düşebildirler? Sonuçta, doğa hakkında haklı çıkan taraf doğa bilimciler değil sosyal bilimciler oldu. Deney ve gözlem imkanlarının gelişmesiyle birlikte doğa bilimci empristler, 2300 senelik bir gecikmeyle de olsa (materyalist Demokritos’un ölümü MÖ 370) atomun varlığını kabul ettiler.","completion":"Doğa bilimleri ve sosyal bilimler arasındaki bu karşılaşma, bilginin doğası ve bilimsel yöntemlerin sınırları hakkında derin soruları gündeme getirir. Özellikle 19. ve 20. yüzyılın başlarında, pozitivizm ve emprio-kritisizm gibi duyumlara dayanan yaklaşımlar ile materyalizm arasındaki çatışma, bilim ve felsefe dünyasında önemli tartışmalara neden oldu. Bu çatışmanın merkezinde, bilginin nasıl elde edildiği ve bilimin doğasına dair farklı görüşler yer alıyor. Pozitivist ve emprio-kritik yaklaşımlar, yalnızca doğrudan gözlemlenebilir olguların bilginin kaynağı olabileceğini savunur. Bu yaklaşımlara göre, gözlem ve deney dışında elde edilen her türlü bilgi kuşkuyla karşılanmalıdır. Atom gibi doğrudan gözlemlenemeyen nesnelerin varlığı konusunda bile şüpheci bir tutum benimsenir. Öte yandan, materyalizm, maddenin varlığını ve dünyanın maddi süreçlerle açıklanabileceğini temel alır. Bu yaklaşımda, duyumlardan elde edilen bilginin ötesinde bir gerçeklik olduğu kabul edilir ve bu tür bir bilginin, teorik önkabuller ve mantıksal çıkarımlar aracılığıyla elde edilebileceğine inanılır. Bu çatışmada Lenin ve benzeri sosyal bilimci materyalistlerin, fizik alanında dogmatik bir şekilde emprio-kritizm yaklaşımına karşı çıkan doğa bilimcilerin önüne geçebilmesinin temel nedeni, materyalizmin, bilgiyi elde etme yöntemleri konusunda daha esnek bir yaklaşım benimsemesidir. Materyalizm, teorik varsayımların ve soyut kavramların, doğrudan gözlemlenemese bile, bilimsel anlayışın gelişiminde önemli bir rol oynayabileceğini savunur. Bu anlamda, materyalist yaklaşım bilimin doğası ve ilerleyişi hakkında daha kapsamlı bir perspektif sunar. 20. yüzyılın ilk yarısına gelindiğinde, özellikle kuantum mekaniği ve atom teorisinin gelişimleriyle birlikte, atomların varlığı bilimsel bir gerçek olarak kabul edildi. Bu gelişmeler, materyalist yaklaşımın temel bazı varsayımlarının doğruluğunu teyit eder nitelikteydi. Bu durum, duyumları esas alan ve yalnızca doğrudan gözlemlenebilir olayları bilginin kaynağı olarak kabul eden emprio-kritik yaklaşımların sınırlılıklarını ortaya koydu. Sonuç olarak, doğa bilimi ve sosyal bilimler arasındaki bu karşılaşma, bilgi ve bilim anlayışımızı şekillendiren temel felsefi meseleleri aydınlatmakta ve bilimsel yöntemin sınırlarını gözler önüne sermektedir. Bu olay, aynı zamanda, farklı disiplinlerden gelen bilim insanları ve felsefeciler arasındaki etkileşimin, bilginin doğası ve sınırları hakkındaki anlayışımızı derinleştirmede ne denli önemli olduğunu göstermektedir."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

James is infuriated by this and grumbles about Edward being late again, though Edward finds it funny. After finishing his work for the day, James is still bad tempered when he puffs back to the shed that afternoon. He complains to Thomas and Percy that Edward always makes other engines wait and clanks like a lot of \\"old iron\\". Thomas and Percy are annoyed at this remark and tell James that Edward could beat him in a race any day, to which James sarcastically says he would like to see. The next morning, James' driver suddenly falls ill and is sent home. With only his fireman on hand, James, to his annoyance, is relegated to shunting for the rest of the day. After the fireman uncouples James from the trucks, the signalman suddenly spots James leaving without anyone in his cab and sets the signals at \\"danger\\" to halt traffic down the line. James' fireman then speaks with the signalman, who says he saw two boys on James' footplate playing with his controls, then quickly ran off when he started. The signalman's telephone rings, with an engine inspector on the other end. After finishing the call, the signalman then tells the fireman that the inspector is coming and wants him to get a shunter's pole and a coil of wire rope. The inspector soon arrives in Edward and the fireman is ready with the pole and the rope. With James' fireman and the inspector riding along with his own crew, Edward sets off. Meanwhile, James happily sails along the line after leaving the yard, oblivious that anything is wrong and simply glad to be free from shunting. Before long, his mood changes as he finds himself starting to go faster. He realizes there is no one in his cab and starts to panic. By now, Edward is racing out of Knapford and heading down the Main Line as fast as he can to catch up to James. Soon, the two are almost neck and neck, with Edward giving it everything he can to keep up. Edward's driver does his best to keep him in alignment with James, while the inspector carefully climbs out of Edward's cab and makes it to his front with a noose of the rope hanging from the crook of the shunting pole, trying to slip the noose over James' right buffer. It is difficult for the inspector, but he finally manages to catch the buffer and tie it to Edward's left one. Braking gently to keep the rope from snapping, Edward's driver checks the two engines' speed, while James' fireman rushes over to his cab and takes control, allowing both engines to finally slow down. As the two tired engines approach Crosby, James apologises for his earlier insult, which Edward accepts. Waiting for them on the platform is the Fat Controller. He congratulates the crew on their rescue and then tells James that he can rest before he takes his next train, while Edward is rewarded with a trip to the Works to get his worn-out parts mended. Edward is delighted, remarking how nice it will be to run without clanking.","completion":"**The Not-So-Great Escape** It was a typical morning at Wellsworth, except for James, who was fuming because Edward was late again. \\"That old iron! Always holding up the line,\\" grumbled James, unwittingly setting the stage for a saga he'd later regret. After a day filled with more grumbles than shunting, James returned to the shed, bad-mouthing Edward to Thomas and Percy. \\"That old slowcoach could never beat me in a race,\\" James huffed, his red paint almost turning scarlet with indignation. Thomas and Percy exchanged an eye-roll. \\"Edward could out-race you any day, James. And he doesn't need fancy paint to do it,\\" Thomas retorted, with Percy nodding in agreement. The next day, disaster struck for James – well, more of an inconvenience really. His driver fell ill, and James had the 'privilege' of a day filled with shunting instead of racing. After being uncoupled from the trucks, however, James decided he'd had enough. \\"Freedom!\\" James cheered, blissfully unaware of the chaos he was about to cause, cruising down the line with no one in his cab. Back at Wellsworth, the signalman quickly alerted everyone to the runaway engine. \\"We've got a rogue red rocket on our hands!\\" he announced, while trying to keep the panic out of his voice. An engine inspector arriving with Edward promptly hatched an action plan that seemed more fitting for a heist movie than a railway rescue. Armed with nothing but a shunter's pole and a coil of wire rope, the pair set out to catch James before he could cause any real mischief. James, meanwhile, was having the time of his life until realization dawned on him. \\"I might actually need a driver,\\" he thought amidst his accelerating panic. Edward, now on a mission, powered down the tracks - if trains could sweat, he'd be soaking. Side by side, the inspector leaned precariously out of Edward's cab, aiming to lasso James like a wayward cow at a rodeo. After several nail-biting attempts, the inspector snagged James' buffer with the rope. James, feeling the pull, let out a gasp, \\"I didn't sign up for extreme sports!\\" With Edward's help and a slight nudge from fate, James was brought back under control, ready to sheepishly face the music. As they approached Crosby, James mumbled an apology to Edward, who simply smiled, the day's events proving louder than any words could. The Fat Controller awaited them, his expression a blend of disbelief and amusement. \\"Well done,\\" he began, pausing for dramatic effect, \\"but let's keep the racing to the tracks, shall we?\\" Turning to James, he added, \\"And perhaps less talk about 'old iron', unless you fancy a career in steeplechase!\\" Edward chuckled, the prospect of a quiet visit to the Works far more appealing than any accolade. As for James, he realized some races are best left unrun—especially those against shunter’s poles and rope-wielding inspectors."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Степанов и Ельцов были расстреляны, а всё их имущество было конфисковано государством.

Большинство репрессий и судебных решений в то время принимались на основе политически мотивированных решений, а не строго соблюдая закон. Массовые политические репрессии и лишение имущества были характерными чертами режима того времени. Хочу подчеркнуть, что нарушения прав человека и несправедливость, как в случае с Степановым и Ельцовым, недопустимы в цивилизованном обществе.

James is infuriated by this and grumbles about Edward being late again, though Edward finds it funny. After finishing his work for the day, James is still bad tempered when he puffs back to the shed that afternoon. He complains to Thomas and Percy that Edward always makes other engines wait and clanks like a lot of “old iron”. Thomas and Percy are annoyed at this remark and tell James that Edward could beat him in a race any day, to which James sarcastically says he would like to see. The next morning, James’ driver suddenly falls ill and is sent home. With only his fireman on hand, James, to his annoyance, is relegated to shunting for the rest of the day. After the fireman uncouples James from the trucks, the signalman suddenly spots James leaving without anyone in his cab and sets the signals at “danger” to halt traffic down the line. James’ fireman then speaks with the signalman, who says he saw two boys on James’ footplate playing with his controls, then quickly ran off when he started. The signalman’s telephone rings, with an engine inspector on the other end. After finishing the call, the signalman then tells the fireman that the inspector is coming and wants him to get a shunter’s pole and a coil of wire rope. The inspector soon arrives in Edward and the fireman is ready with the pole and the rope. With James’ fireman and the inspector riding along with his own crew, Edward sets off. Meanwhile, James happily sails along the line after leaving the yard, oblivious that anything is wrong and simply glad to be free from shunting. Before long, his mood changes as he finds himself starting to go faster. He realizes there is no one in his cab and starts to panic. By now, Edward is racing out of Knapford and heading down the Main Line as fast as he can to catch up to James. Soon, the two are almost neck and neck, with Edward giving it everything he can to keep up. Edward’s driver does his best to keep him in alignment with James, while the inspector carefully climbs out of Edward’s cab and makes it to his front with a noose of the rope hanging from the crook of the shunting pole, trying to slip the noose over James’ right buffer. It is difficult for the inspector, but he finally manages to catch the buffer and tie it to Edward’s left one. Braking gently to keep the rope from snapping, Edward’s driver checks the two engines’ speed, while James’ fireman rushes over to his cab and takes control, allowing both engines to finally slow down. As the two tired engines approach Crosby, James apologises for his earlier insult, which Edward accepts. Waiting for them on the platform is the Fat Controller. He congratulates the crew on their rescue and then tells James that he can rest before he takes his next train, while Edward is rewarded with a trip to the Works to get his worn-out parts mended. Edward is delighted, remarking how nice it will be to run without clanking.","completion":"James was huffing and puffing at Wellsworth, his steam simmering with impatience much like a teapot ready to whistle. “Old Iron Edward,” he muttered under his breath, “more like Ancient Iron at this pace!” Edward finally chugged into sight, a mischievous twinkle in his lamp. “Sorry, James, I was just taking a scenic tour of Sodor. You know, enjoying the retirement age,” he jested, rolling in leisurely. Back at the shed, James was still steaming like a freshly baked pie. “Edward’s so old, I bet he remembers when steam was the latest technology!” he complained to Thomas and Percy. Percy tried to hide a giggle while Thomas, trying to keep a straight face, said, “Well, maybe he’s just gearing up to beat you in a race. You know, tortoise and the hare?” James snorted. “I’d like to see that! I’d be finished and back for a wash-down before he even crosses the start line!” Little did James know, fate had an ironic twist in store. The following morning, with James’ driver out sick - probably too much laughing at James’ jokes - James found himself in a predicament. Reduced to shunting duty, he felt like a circus elephant balancing on a ball. “From express engine to shunter... What’s next? Taking visitors on garden tours?” His grumbles were cut short when the signalman frantically waved, “James, you're about to take a solo tour!” It seemed some cheeky boys had turned James into Sodor’s first ‘self-driving’ engine. James, now on an unexpected adventure, initially relished the freedom. “Ah, the open track! No carts, no passengers, just me and the rails!” However, his joy turned to alarm as he picked up speed. “I didn’t sign up for thrill-seeking!” he gasped. Meanwhile, Edward, with the inspector and the fireman on board, set off in hot pursuit. “Hold onto your funnels!” Edward chuffed, the wind flapping his face decals like ears in the breeze. As Edward gained on James, the inspector, gripping a shunter’s pole and rope like a cowboy at a rodeo, readied himself. Making a lasso of the rope, he leaned precariously from Edward. “I’ve always wanted to try this at the fair!” he declared before successfully lassoing James, connecting the two engines. James was brought under control thanks to Edward’s steady pace and the inspector's rodeo skills. Panting and wheezing, they rolled into Crosby. “Sorry for calling you ‘Old Iron’, Edward. You’re more ‘Sturdy Steel’,” James puffed. On the platform, the Fat Controller awaited, a slight smile playing on his lips. “Well done, everyone. James, you’ve discovered that even express engines can benefit from a slow day. And Edward, Wellsworth’s scenic tour guide, will get a spa day at the Works. We must keep our history in pristine condition, after all!” Edward just beamed, “Running without clanking will indeed be a novelty. But remember, James, slow and steady can sometimes win the race. And I have to say, today was quite the express adventure, even for ‘Old Iron’!” As the engines rested, the Fat Controller mumbled to himself, “Maybe we should add ‘Sodor’s First Engine Rodeo’ to next year’s events.” With a chuckle, he strolled away, leaving James and Edward to bask in their newfound respect for each other’s pace."},{"prompt":"Tell me a story about make middle aged couple Jill and Jack.","completion":"Once upon a time, in a vibrant town nestled between rolling hills and whispering forests, lived a middle-aged couple named Jill and Jack. Their story was not one of fairy tales or grand adventures across distant lands, but rather, a journey of love, resilience, and rediscovery in the ordinary moments of everyday life. Jill and Jack had met in their early twenties, sparks flying the moment their eyes locked across a crowded room at a friend's birthday bash. It hadn't taken long for those sparks to kindle a blazing fire of love, leading them to exchange vows under a canopy of stars, surrounded by the warm glow of loved ones. Years slid by like scenes in a touching movie; moments of laughter, tears, trials, and triumphs knitted them closer, strengthening the fabric of their relationship. They had danced in the rain, comforted each other during loss, celebrated wins, and navigated the challenges of life together, hand in hand. As middle age crept upon them with the stealth of a cat, Jill and Jack found themselves in a comfortable routine. Their children, now grown with dreams and paths of their own, had left the nest quiet but filled with echoes of the past. Life had become predictable; morning kisses, days filled with work and hobbies, evenings spent sharing stories of their day, and nights wrapped in the warmth of each other's embrace. But Jill felt a stirring in her heart, a whisper of wind calling for change. One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, she shared her thoughts with Jack. \\"Do you ever wonder if there's more to life than this beautiful routine we've built?\\" she asked, her voice soft but filled with curiosity. Jack looked into her eyes, seeing the flicker of adventure dancing within. \\"I do,\\" he admitted, wrapping his arm around her. \\"What do you have in mind?\\" And so, they embarked on a journey not of distance, but of depth. They started a tradition of \\"adventure Fridays,\\" where each week, one of them would plan something entirely out of their ordinary - from salsa dancing lessons, pottery classes, and mystery dinner theaters, to spontaneous road trips to small towns with histories to tell. With every experience, Jill and Jack discovered new facets of each other and themselves. Laughter filled their home more often, spurring conversations that stretched into the night, reviving the exhilaration of their youth. They rediscovered passions that had been tucked away and found joy in learning and growing together. One particularly memorable adventure led them to a small, forgotten vineyard just as the sun was setting. As they explored, hand in hand, they stumbled upon the owner, an elderly man with stories that captivated their hearts. They spent the evening under the stars, sipping wine and listening to tales of love, loss, and redemption. It was a reminder of the beauty of connecting with strangers, of shared humanity, and of the endless surprises life had to offer. Their adventures brought them closer, knitting their hearts together with new threads of understanding, respect, and unbridled affection. Jill and Jack realized that adventure wasn't always about crossing oceans or scaling mountains; sometimes, it was about diving into the depths of the heart and exploring the boundless landscapes of love. As years continued to weave their inevitable tapestry around Jill and Jack, they looked back at their life with no regrets. They had chosen to live fully, to love fiercely, and to embrace the joys of rediscovery at every turn. And in doing so, they found that the greatest adventure was not the one that took them far from home, but the one that brought them closer to each other. And so, Jill and Jack lived, not just in the comforting embrace of routine, but in the exhilarating clasp of continuous discovery, their love a beacon that shone brightly, illuminating the path for generations to follow."},{"prompt":"Very nice. Please true the story in a way where Jill wants to have an open marriage and it happens at the vineyard.","completion":"Amid the predictable weave of their daily lives, Jill harbored a restlessness deep within her soul. It was a yearning for connection that extended beyond the familiar contours of her life with Jack. Her love for him was as vast as the ocean, yet she couldn't shake off the feeling that there were uncharted waters within her heart waiting to be explored. One fateful evening, under the vast expanse of a starlit sky at a remote vineyard they had stumbled upon during one of their adventure Fridays, amidst the old vines that whispered secrets of passion and time, Jill found the courage to voice her deepest desires. The vineyard, owned by a kind-hearted man whose life stories of love and loss resonated with Jill and Jack, became the backdrop for a turning point in their lives. As they savored the rich wine and the company of their elderly host, the conversation veered into realms of love, desire, and the human need for varied connections. It was then that Jill, her heart beating a fierce staccato, broached the subject of an open marriage. Jack, ever her partner, her confidant, listened with a heart wide open. He saw not just Jill's words but also the vulnerability and hope that laced them. The idea was foreign, daunting even, but in the tapestry of life they had woven together, every thread mattered, including this newly introduced strand. They spent hours under the night sky, not just conversing but truly communicating. They shared fears, dreams, insecurities, and desires, laying bare the depths of their souls as they had never done before. This night at the vineyard was not just a turning point but a deepening of the bond they shared. The decision to open their marriage was not taken lightly. It evolved from numerous conversations, considerations of boundaries, and immense trust. It was about honoring each other's quest for self-discovery and connection without losing the essence of the love that had been the cornerstone of their relationship. As the seasons changed, so did the dynamics of their marriage. They explored connections with others, always with honesty and respect at the forefront. This journey was not without its challenges. There were moments of doubt, of fear that the fabric of their relationship might unravel. Yet, each time, they found their way back to each other, their bond fortified by honesty and open communication. The vineyard became a yearly pilgrimage for Jill and Jack, a place to reflect on the past and dream of the future. It was there, amidst the ancient vines, that they reaffirmed their commitment to each other, not as owners of each other's happiness but as partners in the truest sense. Their love story, now woven with more colors and textures, became a testament to the power of love, communication, and openness. Jill and Jack’s journey into an open marriage was a path less traveled, fraught with unknowns, yet it was their path, chosen and walked together, hand in hand, heart to heart. And so, their story evolved, a narrative of love’s endless capacity to transform and grow. In embracing the full spectrum of human connection, they discovered a deeper, more profound love, not just for each other but for the journey itself."},{"prompt":"Who is the owner of Twitter(X)?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, the owner of Twitter, which was rebranded as X, is Elon Musk.

James is infuriated by this and grumbles about Edward being late again, though Edward finds it funny. After finishing his work for the day, James is still bad tempered when he puffs back to the shed that afternoon. He complains to Thomas and Percy that Edward always makes other engines wait and clanks like a lot of “old iron”. Thomas and Percy are annoyed at this remark and tell James that Edward could beat him in a race any day, to which James sarcastically says he would like to see. The next morning, James’ driver suddenly falls ill and is sent home. With only his fireman on hand, James, to his annoyance, is relegated to shunting for the rest of the day. After the fireman uncouples James from the trucks, the signalman suddenly spots James leaving without anyone in his cab and sets the signals at “danger” to halt traffic down the line. James’ fireman then speaks with the signalman, who says he saw two boys on James’ footplate playing with his controls, then quickly ran off when he started. The signalman’s telephone rings, with an engine inspector on the other end. After finishing the call, the signalman then tells the fireman that the inspector is coming and wants him to get a shunter’s pole and a coil of wire rope. The inspector soon arrives in Edward and the fireman is ready with the pole and the rope. With James’ fireman and the inspector riding along with his own crew, Edward sets off. Meanwhile, James happily sails along the line after leaving the yard, oblivious that anything is wrong and simply glad to be free from shunting. Before long, his mood changes as he finds himself starting to go faster. He realizes there is no one in his cab and starts to panic. By now, Edward is racing out of Knapford and heading down the Main Line as fast as he can to catch up to James. Soon, the two are almost neck and neck, with Edward giving it everything he can to keep up. Edward’s driver does his best to keep him in alignment with James, while the inspector carefully climbs out of Edward’s cab and makes it to his front with a noose of the rope hanging from the crook of the shunting pole, trying to slip the noose over James’ right buffer. It is difficult for the inspector, but he finally manages to catch the buffer and tie it to Edward’s left one. Braking gently to keep the rope from snapping, Edward’s driver checks the two engines’ speed, while James’ fireman rushes over to his cab and takes control, allowing both engines to finally slow down. As the two tired engines approach Crosby, James apologises for his earlier insult, which Edward accepts. Waiting for them on the platform is the Fat Controller. He congratulates the crew on their rescue and then tells James that he can rest before he takes his next train, while Edward is rewarded with a trip to the Works to get his worn-out parts mended. Edward is delighted, remarking how nice it will be to run without clanking.","completion":"Title: The Great Chase One fine morning at the Island of Sodor, James found himself in a huff. Waiting at Wellsworth for Edward yet again, he couldn’t help but let out a steamy sigh. “I swear, that old clanker is late one more time, I’ll—” “Find it amusing?” Edward chuffed in, puffing smoke rings of laughter as he arrived. “Oh, chuckle all you want! You’re as punctual as a sloth at a marathon!” James grumbled, his paintwork shimmering with indignation. Later that day, James returned to the shed, still boiling over like a forgotten kettle. Thomas and Percy, trying hard to contain their chuckles, listened to him rant. “Edward? Fast? He clanks more than my grandma's kitchen pots! I’d beat him in a race any day!” James huffed, his dome almost steaming off. Thomas and Percy exchanged a glance. “Bet you’d see his buffers before you could say ‘slow engine’!” Percy giggled. The next morning dawned with quite the plot twist. James' driver called in sick, leaving James with just his fireman and a day of dreaded shunting. As if his day couldn’t get any worse, a sneaky duo of troublemakers danced onto James' footplate amidst the shunting chaos, sending him off on a solo run down the line. “Freedom!” James thought, unaware of the imminent disaster. “No more complaining about Edward today!” Meanwhile, as James began his unwitting descent into madness, racing down the track like a runaway circus train, Edward was called upon for a heroic rescue. With the inspector on board, Edward chugged valiantly after the runaway red. The scene was something right out of an engine action movie, minus the explosions and with more steam. As Edward caught up, the inspector, equipped with a shunter's pole and wire rope, looked like a cowboy about to lasso a wild stallion. With a few swings and a miss, he finally lassoed James’ buffer. “Gotcha!” he exclaimed, tying the two engines together. With James’ fireman finally in control and the engines slowing to a halt, James was more embarrassed than a cat caught in a doggy door. As they rolled into Crosby Station, James made his apologies, now a humbled engine. Edward simply chuffed, “All in a day’s work.” There, the Fat Controller awaited, his expression stern yet relieved. “Well done, everyone! James, you can rest before your next train. Edward, off to the Works for you, to get rid of that ‘clank’.” “Ah, bliss!” Edward sighed, thinking of the silent running he’d soon enjoy. Moral of the story? Don’t grumble about your elders; they might just be your rescuers. Also, if you ever find yourself unintentionally playing ‘train’, maybe check for sneaky kids on your footplate."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Edward is delighted, remarking how nice it will be to run without clanking.","completion":"Given your request, I'll craft a scenario that maintains a level of humor and cheekiness without crossing the line into explicit content. --- One fine morning at Wellsworth, James found himself in quite the huff. \\"Bloody Edward, always late! Probably stopped to chat with a field of daisies,\\" he grumbled, steam puffing out of his funnel like a kettle left on too long. Edward, always the cheeky character, chuffed in, wearing a grin that could light up the darkest of tunnels. \\"Oh, James, if only you could appreciate the joy of a good clank,\\" he chuckled, thoroughly amused by his own presumed 'old iron' charm. James, turning redder than his paintwork, wasn’t having any of it. Back at the shed, he vented his frustrations to an audience of Thomas and Percy. \\"Edward's nothing but old scrap on wheels. I’d beat him in a race even if I was hauling the Fat Controller's entire dinner service behind me!\\" James boasted, clearly unaware of the irony. Thomas and Percy exchanged an amused glance, knowing all too well that pride comes before a fall - or in this case, a chase. The following morning, as fate would have it, James' driver called in sick, leaving James tied to the mundane task of shunting - oh, the indignity! Midway through the ordeal, two mischievous boys tinkered with James, sending him speeding down the tracks with a bewildered fireman chasing behind. Edward, now in the role of the unlikely hero, was tasked with saving the day. The signalman, the fireman, and a potbellied inspector who seemed far too excited about the impending chase, hopped aboard Edward. Off they went, Edward puffing like an aging athlete determined to show the youngsters how it's done. James, on the other hand, was having the thrill of his life until the realization dawned on him - no one was driving! His panic was palpable, steam flying off in all directions like a mad octopus. As Edward closed in, the inspector, balancing precariously with a shunter’s pole and rope, looked like a fisherman trying to reel in the catch of the day. After a theatrical struggle, he finally lassoed James, tying the two engines together. Slowly, they came to a halt, bringing relief to James who was now profusely apologizing to Edward, \\"I take it all back! You’re not old iron; you're... vintage steel!\\" The Fat Controller, waiting at Crosby with an expression that could only be described as ‘attempting not to laugh’, commended the bravery of the crews. Turning to Edward, he said, \\"And you, the most distinguished ‘vintage steel,’ will be getting the spa treatment at the Works.\\" Edward, basking in his newly found glory, couldn't resist a final quip, \\"Well, James, looks like this 'clanker' still has a few tricks up his funnel.\\" Thomas and Percy, witnessing all this, couldn't help but burst into laughter. \\"Guess it's true what they say,\\" chuffed Thomas, \\"age before beauty, especially on the rails!\\" And so, the day ended with James contemplating the virtues of humility, Edward dreaming of his ‘spa’ day, and the Fat Controller shaking his head in amused disbelief. All in the life of the engines on the Island of Sodor."},{"prompt":"Write really funny super hilarious comedy 17+ thomas transcript based on each of my prompts: One day, James is forced to wait at Wellsworth for Edward to arrive with his train. James is infuriated by this and grumbles about Edward being late again, though Edward finds it funny. After finishing his work for the day, James is still bad tempered when he puffs back to the shed that afternoon. He complains to Thomas and Percy that Edward always makes other engines wait and clanks like a lot of “old iron”. Thomas and Percy are annoyed at this remark and tell James that Edward could beat him in a race any day, to which James sarcastically says he would like to see. The next morning, James’ driver suddenly falls ill and is sent home. With only his fireman on hand, James, to his annoyance, is relegated to shunting for the rest of the day. After the fireman uncouples James from the trucks, the signalman suddenly spots James leaving without anyone in his cab and sets the signals at “danger” to halt traffic down the line. James’ fireman then speaks with the signalman, who says he saw two boys on James’ footplate playing with his controls, then quickly ran off when he started. The signalman’s telephone rings, with an engine inspector on the other end. After finishing the call, the signalman then tells the fireman that the inspector is coming and wants him to get a shunter’s pole and a coil of wire rope. The inspector soon arrives in Edward and the fireman is ready with the pole and the rope. With James’ fireman and the inspector riding along with his own crew, Edward sets off. Meanwhile, James happily sails along the line after leaving the yard, oblivious that anything is wrong and simply glad to be free from shunting. Before long, his mood changes as he finds himself starting to go faster. He realizes there is no one in his cab and starts to panic. By now, Edward is racing out of Knapford and heading down the Main Line as fast as he can to catch up to James.

Thomas, always the peacemaker, intervened. \\"I bet Edward could beat you in a race any day, James.\\" James scoffed, his steam hissing in derision. \\"I'd like to see him try,\\" he chortled, imagining the supposedly \\"old\\" engine trying to outpace him. The next day dawned with unexpected drama: James' driver had fallen ill, making James' already sour mood curdle. Left with only his fireman, James found himself relegated to the profoundly humbling world of shunting. \\"From express engine to shunting? It's an outrage!\\" he huffed. But James' day was about to get a lot more exciting. After being uncoupled from the trucks, James suddenly found himself rolling down the track, completely driverless. \\"I'm getting my race after all!\\" he initially thought gleefully, unaware of the trouble ahead. Meanwhile, at the signal box, the signalman had noticed James' unplanned departure. \\"Not on my watch,\\" he muttered, dialing the inspector urgently after setting the signals to \\"danger”. Edward, ever the hero, was soon enlisted to chase down the runaway James, his own driver and the inspector gearing up with a shunter's pole and a wire rope, a plan quickly forming. \\"We're going on a wild engine hunt,\\" Edward thought, surprisingly thrilled at the concept. James, now realizing he was running out of control, was far from thrilled. \\"This isn't the kind of race I had in mind!\\" he wailed as the scenery zipped past at an alarming rate. As Edward caught up, the inspector, with the agility of a circus performer, managed to lasso James' buffer with the rope. \\"Gotcha!\\" he exclaimed, as if he had just wrangled a wild bull rather than a runaway engine. Gradually, with Edward's help, James was brought to a safe stop, both engines panting and wheezing from the exertion. “Apologies for the 'old iron' comment,” James panted, realizing humility was the best course of action. Edward, gracious in his victory, just smiled. Waiting for them was the Fat Controller, his expression a mix of relief and sternness. \\"Well done on the rescue,\\" he said, before turning to James. \\"As for you, perhaps a little 'shunting therapy' will curb that ego of yours.\\" Edward, for his bravery (and patience with James), was rewarded with a trip to the Works. \\"Ah, finally,\\" he beamed. \\"Can't wait to run without that dreadful clanking.\\" And as for James? He found a new respect for both shunting and Edward. Though he’d never admit it openly, deep down, he knew he'd just been part of the most exhilarating race of his life."},{"prompt":"Среди 15 лампочек 4 испорчены.

Below is an approach detailing how to structure the GNN model, set up RL with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and design the training loop. Due to the complexity of this task, it's important to note that practical experimentation and hyperparameter tuning will be vital for achieving optimal performance. # 1. Defining a Suitable GNN Model For this task, a suitable GNN model must handle the node features, edge features, and adjacency matrix to accurately predict the circuit's performance metrics. To accomplish this, we can use a model structure similar to the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) enhanced for edge features. \`\`\`python import torch.nn.functional as F from torch_geometric.nn import GINConv, global_add_pool class GNNModel(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, node_feature_dim, edge_feature_dim, output_dim): super(GNNModel, self).__init__() self.conv1 = GINConv(nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(node_feature_dim, 64), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(64, 64))) self.edge_embed = nn.Linear(edge_feature_dim, node_feature_dim) self.conv2 = GINConv(nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(64, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, output_dim))) def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr): # Enhanced edge features are aggregated into node features edge_embeddings = self.edge_embed(edge_attr) x = x + global_add_pool(edge_embeddings, edge_index[0]) x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index)) x = self.conv2(x, edge_index) return x \`\`\` This model first enhances node features with aggregated edge features, then applies GNN layers to produce predictions related to the performance metrics of the circuit. # 2. Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Setup \`\`\`python import torch from stable_baselines3 import PPO from stable_baselines3.common.env_util import make_vec_env class CustomActorCriticPolicy(nn.Module): def __init__(self, observation_space, action_space): super(CustomActorCriticPolicy, self).__init__() # Define the policy network (actor) and value network (critic) self.policy = GNNModel(...) self.value_net = GNNModel(...) # Define other necessary components for the policy def forward(self, observations): # Implement forward pass to generate actions and value estimates pass # You may need to wrap or adjust your environment to work with stable_baselines3 # Assuming \`env\` is compatible with gym.Env or has been wrapped appropriately: ppo_agent = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1) \`\`\` For a custom setup, you'd adapt the \`CustomActorCriticPolicy\` to handle graph-based observations and actions determined by your circuit simulation needs. # 3. Training Loop With the custom GNN model and PPO setup, the main training loop will involve iterating through episodes, making decisions based on the environment state (circuit parameters and performance metrics), and updating the model using the reward signal. \`\`\`python for episode in range(total_episodes): obs = env.reset() done = False while not done: action, _states = ppo_agent.predict(obs) obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action) ppo_agent.learn(total_timesteps=..., reset_num_timesteps=done) \`\`\` Implementing this approach requires tuning based on the specific dynamics of your circuit environment, including defining appropriate reward functions and adjusting the architecture/details of the GNN and PPO implementations. This pseudo-code aims to give a high-level overview and starting point for a complex optimization task and requires significant adaptation for practical use. Remember, achieving optimal performance in such a high-dimensional optimization task is challenging and will likely involve iterative refinement of the model architecture, RL setup, and simulation environment handling."},{"prompt":"How good the suggested Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) is suitable for my requirements, where the graph topology is fixed and we need to optimize the node features(input 13 design variables) to obtain the goal objective (target performance metrics). and my graph has parallel edges(from same transistor, the terminals drain and source are connected with the same nets it creates parallel edges in the bipartite miltigraph representation, where the edges are from different terminal but from the same device component). So, i need to convey the edge features along with the node features to the model to avoid the conflicts of self looping.","completion":"Given your specific requirements, including the need to optimize node features within a fixed topology and account for parallel edges in your graph (which arise from the same transistor terminals being connected to the same nets), the use of a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) must be carefully considered and adapted to fulfill your criteria effectively. # Addressing Fixed Topology and Node Features Optimization: The GIN is quite powerful in learning representations that respect the graph's structure. Its design is grounded on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test of graph isomorphism, allowing it to effectively learn different node embeddings based on their roles in the graph. Given that your graph's topology is fixed, the primary task becomes learning an optimal representation of the node features that can accurately predict the target performance metrics. The GIN is suitable for learning complex mappings from node features (in your case, circuit design variables) to outputs, as long as the model has sufficient capacity (layers and units) to capture the underlying relationships. # Handling Parallel Edges and Edge Features: For the second part of your challenge, incorporating edge features, especially when dealing with parallel edges from the same component (e.g., different terminals of the same transistor), requires a thoughtful approach to ensure that the GIN model captures these nuances effectively. One strategy to handle parallel edges and their associated features is to adjust how edge features are aggregated or utilized within the GIN framework. The GIN model primarily focuses on node features and employs aggregation functions to combine information from neighbors. To incorporate edge features, especially from parallel edges, you can enhance the node feature aggregation step to also consider edge attributes. For instance, before aggregating neighbor features, you could combine the edge features with the node features of their corresponding endpoints, ensuring that the information carried by parallel edges is not lost or conflated. Another approach is to explicitly model these parallel edges within the GNN architecture by using separate channels or dimensions for different types of connections (e.g., one dimension for each terminal type). This way, the model can distinguish between the different types of connections that exist between the same pair of nodes (transistor terminals). # Modified Approach: You might consider modifying the initial GNNModel definition to explicitly incorporate and differentiate the parallel edge features: \`\`\`python class EnhancedGINConv(GINConv): def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr): # Process edge attributes to enhance node features or aggregation # For instance, modify edge_attr based on type or enhance node features before aggregation return super().forward(x, edge_index) # Replace GINConv in the GNNModel with EnhancedGINConv \`\`\` In summary, while the GIN can serve as a solid foundation, you’ll likely need to adapt its architecture and operations (especially regarding edge feature processing) to effectively address the unique aspects of your application. Experimentation with how parallel edges and their features are integrated into the model will be key to achieving high performance, ensuring that the GNN can leverage all available information from both node and edge features."},{"prompt":"provide me the complete implementation of the suggested 'Modified Approach'","completion":"To implement the proposed modified approach that can handle parallel edges and integrates both node and edge features effectively within a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) architecture, I'll provide a more detailed implementation. This version emphasizes handling the specifics of your circuit design optimization problem, where the topology is fixed but requires effective tuning of the input design variables alongside considering the parallel edges and their features.

Advanced handling, such as differentiating between types of parallel edges, may require more detailed customizations and is highly dependent on the specifics of your circuit design optimization problem."},{"prompt":"i am also having the 'adjacency matrix' does it needed as input to the model","completion":"In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), the adjacency matrix represents the connections between nodes within the graph. In PyTorch Geometric (PyG), which appears to be the framework you're using (based on the code snippets and methodology described), the graph structure is typically represented in a sparse format known as \\"edge index\\". This edge index is a more efficient way to represent the graph connections than a dense adjacency matrix, especially for large and sparse graphs, which is common in many real-world scenarios, including circuit design optimization tasks. # Do You Need to Use an Adjacency Matrix? For the most part, in PyG and similar GNN frameworks, the edge index format is preferred over dense adjacency matrices due to computational efficiency and memory usage improvements. However, there are specific scenarios or operations where having the adjacency matrix might be necessary or beneficial: 1. **Custom Operations:** If you're performing specific graph operations that are naturally expressed or executed using the adjacency matrix. This might include certain types of graph algorithms that you wish to integrate within the model or preprocessing step. 2. **Dense Layers or Operations:** If your GNN model integrates operations that require a dense representation of the graph, such as certain types of pooling, convolution operations that aren't directly supported in a sparse format, or specific attention mechanisms that operate on the full graph. 3. **Compatibility:** If you're interfacing with other libraries or algorithms that specifically require the adjacency matrix as input. # How to Handle It? If you find that you do need to utilize the adjacency matrix within your model for any reason, it can be provided as an input alongside other features (node features, edge features). However, it's crucial to manage the potential increase in computational cost and memory usage. Here is an example snippet of how you might adjust the \`CircuitGNNModel\` class to accept an adjacency matrix as an additional input: \`\`\`python class CircuitGNNModelWithAdj(nn.Module): def __init__(self, node_feature_dim, edge_feature_dim, output_dim): super(CircuitGNNModelWithAdj, self).__init__() # Your GNN layers self.conv1 = ... # Your first GNN layer here. self.conv2 = ... # Your second GNN layer here. # Potential layers to utilize adjacency matrix directly def forward(self, data, adj_matrix=None): x, edge_index, edge_attr = data.x, data.edge_index, data.edge_attr # Use GNN layers here x = ... # Convolutional operations if adj_matrix is not None: # Optionally perform operations that utilize the adjacency matrix pass return x \`\`\` In practice, you would continue to use edge indexes for the primary graph convolution operations while integrating the adjacency matrix only where necessary for specific parts of your model or operations. If you decide to include adjacency matrices in your workflow, consider their sparse representation (\`torch.sparse_coo_tensor\`) to mitigate some of the memory and computational overhead, especially relevant for large graphs. # Conclusion In summary, while the primary graph representation in PyTorch Geometric and similar GNN implementations often revolves around edge indexes for efficiency, there might be valid cases for also including the adjacency matrix as an input to your models. Evaluate the specific needs and potential impacts on performance and complexity before integrating adjacency matrices, especially for large-scale or efficiency-critical applications like circuit design optimization."},{"prompt":"the action state from the GNN model is for the '13 variables' need to optimally tune the 13 input variables in my circuit environmment. import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from torch_geometric.nn import GINConv, global_mean_pool from torch_geometric.data import Data class EnhancedGINConv(GINConv): def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr=None): # Assuming edge_attr is not None and has dimensions [num_edges, num_edge_features] # Edge aggregation could be more sophisticated depending on the problem specifics. if edge_attr is not None: row, col = edge_index # Example: Aggregating edge features to target node features before convolution. # This is a simple mean aggregation of edge features to start nodes. # More advanced methods might consider the types of edges, their directions, etc. edge_feature_agg = scatter_mean(edge_attr, col, dim=0, dim_size=x.size(0)) x += edge_feature_agg return super().forward(x, edge_index) class CircuitGNNModel(nn.Module): def init(self, node_feature_dim, edge_feature_dim, output_dim): super(CircuitGNNModel, self).init() self.conv1 = EnhancedGINConv(nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(node_feature_dim + edge_feature_dim, 64), # Notice the adjustment in feature dimensions nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(64, 64))) self.conv2 = EnhancedGINConv(nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(64, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, output_dim))) def forward(self, data): x, edge_index, edge_attr = data.x, data.edge_index, data.edge_attr # Convolutional layers with edge attribute considerations x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index, edge_attr)) x = self.conv2(x, edge_index) # Globally pool graph features to produce a single output vector for predicting circuit performance metrics x = global_mean_pool(x, torch.zeros(data.num_nodes, dtype=torch.long).to(x.device)) # Assuming a single graph instance return x # Example usage: node_features_dim = 13 # e.g., 13 design variables as node features edge_features_dim = 3 # Assuming 3 features per edge for illustration output_dim = 7 # e.g., 7 target performance metrics model = CircuitGNNModel(node_features_dim, edge_features_dim, output_dim) # Example data (Dummy data for demonstration): num_nodes = 5 # Example: 5 nodes num_edges = 10 # Example: 10 edges (with potential parallel edges) x = torch.rand((num_nodes, node_features_dim)) # Random node features edge_index = torch.randint(0, num_nodes, (2, num_edges)) # Random edge indices edge_attr = torch.rand((num_edges, edge_features_dim)) # Random edge attributes data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index, edge_attr=edge_attr) # Forward pass (For demonstration purposes; in practice, connected to your training loop and environment) output = model(data) print(output) # Outputs are the predicted performance metrics","completion":"To utilize the output of your GNN model for tuning the 13 input variables in your circuit environment as actions, you need a clear strategy for connecting the predictions of your model to the action space of your environment. Since the original question suggests optimizing circuit design variables, I presume the output of the GNN model should influence the next set of design variables to test in the simulation environment. This task traditionally falls under the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), where action values are determined based on model predictions/state evaluations. The \`CircuitGNNModel\` you defined produces an output meant to predict circuit performance metrics. If your objective is to use these predictions directly to adjust the 13 design variables, you'd need a mechanism (possibly another model or an algorithmic strategy) to map performance predictions to adjustments in design variables. However, if your intent is for the GNN model itself to suggest the next set of design variables (as actions in an RL context), your model architecture and training loop need modifications to align with this goal. This involves: 1. Adjusting the model’s output dimension to match the number of design variables (13 in your case). 2. Training the model in an RL framework where it learns to predict the next best set of design variables based on the current state and received reward (performance metrics feedback). Here’s how you might adjust the model and conceptualize its use within an RL framework for directly outputting action recommendations (the 13 design variables): # Adjusting CircuitGNNModel for Action Recommendations Let's adjust the model’s output dimension and conceptual usage: \`\`\`python class CircuitGNNModelForActions(nn.Module): def __init__(self, node_feature_dim, edge_feature_dim): super(CircuitGNNModelForActions, self).__init__() self.node_feature_dim = node_feature_dim self.edge_feature_dim = edge_feature_dim # Adjust output_dim to match the number of design variables output_dim = node_feature_dim # Now aims to produce action recommendations self.conv1 = EnhancedGINConv(nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(node_feature_dim + edge_feature_dim, 64), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(64, 64))) self.conv2 = EnhancedGINConv(nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(64, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, output_dim))) # Note the change here def forward(self, data): x, edge_index, edge_attr = data.x, data.edge_index, data.edge_attr x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index, edge_attr)) actions = self.conv2(x, edge_index) # Renamed to 'actions' for clarity # Aggregate over nodes if necessary or ensure the output shape matches action space actions = global_mean_pool(actions, torch.zeros(data.num_nodes, dtype=torch.long).to(actions.device)) return actions \`\`\` # Conceptual RL Framework In an RL setting, this model would act as a policy network, suggesting the next actions (circuit design variables) based on the current state (node and edge features representing the current circuit configuration). 1. **Action Selection:** Use the model to select the next set of design variables based on current graph features. 2. **Environment Interaction:** Apply these design variables in the circuit simulation environment, observe the next state and reward (performance metrics). 3. **Training:** Adjust the model weights based on the reward signal to improve future action recommendations. This adjustment aligns with the goal of optimizing the input design variables by learning from the performance metrics feedback directly. However, integrating this model into a full RL framework (like using PPO or another RL algorithm) requires additional components, including defining a suitable reward function, managing state transitions, and implementing the training loop that updates the model based on rewards. Remember, this outline simplifies many complexities involved in coupling GNNs with RL for design optimization and assumes you have a mechanism to translate graph-based recommendations into actionable design variables.

One day, Edward has some good news for Trevor; the Fat Controller has asked that he be sent to the site of the new harbour to help out with the work. Trevor instantly perks up, excited about getting to work and meeting children. Edward brings him to the yard to meet Thomas. Upon meeting Trevor, Thomas, who is carrying metal pilings needed for the construction work, is initially skeptical of the newcomer. After Trevor's flatbed is coupled to Thomas' train, the two set off for the harbour. On the way, Trevor explains the many different types of work he can do and how he does not need rails to be useful. This helps Thomas understand Trevor better. The harbour is in complete disarray when Thomas and Trevor arrive; trucks are derailed and blocking the line and stone slabs are littered throughout the area. Thomas' driver tells the two that the equipment Thomas is carrying is essential, so Trevor must go to work taking it around the mess. Trevor, who enjoys this kind of work, is happy to do the job as soon as he is off the flatbed. While Thomas moves the trucks, Trevor carries the construction equipment to where it is needed. Thomas later brings Annie and Clarabel to the harbour to meet Trevor and is left very impressed with Trevor after seeing him work so hard. This makes him finally understand just how useful a traction engine can truly be. Both Annie and Clarabel are carrying children, whom Trevor is more than happy to give rides to on the seaside. This is easily his favourite part of the day and Annie and Clarabel remark to each other how kind and gentle Trevor is and how he reminds them of Thomas. Thomas and Trevor are both very sorry when the day is over and Trevor has to return to the orchard. When parting ways at the junction, Thomas notices Trevor has a small tear in his eye. He pretends not to notice and cheers Trevor up by telling him that there is now plenty of work for him at the Vicarage and that he could be needed at the harbour again soon, which that makes Trevor feel better. That evening, Trevor thinks about the day's events and the children before falling happily asleep.","completion":"Sure, let's turn that into an almost-too-funny-to-handle transcript, aimed at an older audience: --- **Scene: The Wellsworth Vicarage Orchard.

The button's inner text changes based on whether the video is muted or unmuted. - Added a simple conditional (\`{isMuted ? '' : 'unmute-video'}\`) to the button class to demonstrate the possibility of changing the button's appearance or icon based on the mute state.

By doing so, you've essentially cleared out any previously set \`substatus\` values for these records. If the issue you're facing is that, after running the script, when you go to a form and try to select a value for \`substatus\`, you're only seeing \\"None\\" and not the full list of choices, it could be due to a couple of reasons unrelated to the script you ran. The script itself does not modify the choice list but only the values of the \`substatus\` field for each applicable record. Here are a few things you might want to check: 1. **Choice List Configuration**: Ensure that \`substatus\` field's choice list is correctly configured. In ServiceNow, navigate to \\"System Definition\\" -> \\"Choice Lists\\", and look for entries related to the \`substatus\` field of \`alm_hardware\`. Verify that the choices are active and correctly set up. 2. **Dictionary Entry**: Check the dictionary entry for the \`substatus\` field to ensure that it is correctly set to allow choices to be displayed. Go to \\"System Definition\\" -> \\"Dictionary\\" and search for the \`substatus\` field on \`alm_hardware\`. Make sure the field is configured to display choices. 3. **Field Attributes**: Sometimes, field attributes can influence the display of options. In the dictionary entry for \`substatus\`, check if there are any attributes that could potentially restrict the choices being displayed. 4. **User Roles and Permissions**: Verify that the user account you are testing with has the appropriate roles and permissions to view and edit the \`substatus\` choices. Lack of permissions could sometimes lead to not seeing all available field choices. 5. **Record-Specific Criteria**: If the \`substatus\` choices are dynamically populated or restricted based on specific record criteria (such as script includes or business rules), ensure that these conditions are correctly met or configured. 6. **Cache Issues**: Sometimes, UI issues in ServiceNow can be related to browser or server-side cache. Try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito/private browsing window to access the platform. You could also try performing a cache flush on your ServiceNow instance (please note, this action might have broader implications and should be done cautiously, preferably in a non-production environment or during off-hours). If you inadvertently removed values from \`substatus\` that you wish to restore, and if these values were important or relied upon by users or other processes, you might need to either manually restore them based on backup data, or if no backups are available, work with stakeholders to re-establish the desired \`substatus\` values per record. Always ensure you have a rollback plan or data backup before running scripts that modify records in bulk."},{"prompt":"var alm = new GlideRecord(“alm_hardware”); alm.addEncodedQuery(‘install_status=1^substatus!=’); alm.query(); while(alm.next()){ alm.substatus = ‘’; alm.update(); } in servicenow After i wrote this fix script but when i go to form and check for substate it was showing only none choice. how to fix","completion":"The script you've provided is setting the \`substatus\` field of certain \`alm_hardware\` records to an empty string. However, if you're now only seeing \\"None\\" as an option when trying to select a value for \`substatus\` on the form, and not the full list of choices that should be available for that field, then the issue likely doesn't stem directly from the script itself. Instead, it may be related to how the choice list for the \`substatus\` field is configured or potentially a form/view configuration issue. Here are steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue: # 1. Verify the Choice List Configuration - Navigate to **System Definition > Choice Lists** in the application navigator. - Filter the list by the \\"Table\\" column for \`alm_hardware\` and the \\"Element\\" column for \`substatus\`. - Ensure that the choices you expect to see are listed there and that they are active. If the choices are missing or inactive, that could explain why they're not appearing as options. # 2. Check the Dictionary Entry - Go to **System Definition > Dictionary**. - Search for the \`alm_hardware\` table and find the \`substatus\` field. - Ensure that the field type allows for choices (it should be a choice field, not a string field, unless it's using a dynamic choice list that's populated via scripting). - Check if there are any attributes set on the field that may restrict the choices. Attributes can sometimes influence how fields behave. # 3. Form Configuration - While on the form where you're experiencing the issue, click on the hamburger menu on the top left of the form header and select **Configure > Form Design**. - Find the \`substatus\` field on the form layout. Ensure it's added to the form and check if it has any specific configurations that may limit its choice options, like UI Policies or Client Scripts that could be manipulating the available options dynamically. # 4. Clear Cache Sometimes, cache issues can cause unexpected behavior in forms. Try clearing your browser’s cache or using an incognito/private window to see if the issue persists. Additionally, you can clear the server cache in ServiceNow by navigating to **System Diagnostics > Clear Cache** but do note that this action affects all users on the instance, so use it judiciously. # 5. Rollback If Necessary If the script unintentionally caused issues beyond just the observed symptoms or if you suspect that data might have been lost or corrupted, consider rolling back the changes. If you have a backup or a clone of your instance before the script was executed, use that to restore the affected data. If direct restoration isn't feasible, you might need to manually re-enter the correct \`substatus\` values for the affected records. # Final Note If after trying the above steps the problem persists, consider reaching out to your instance's administrator (if you're not one) or ServiceNow support for further assistance. There may be instance-specific configurations or customizations affecting this behavior that are not immediately obvious."},{"prompt":"i wrote below code in my catalog client script and it is working good for the condition if virtual server is found but when the virtual server not found it will need two click on submit button to submit the catalog request. please check the code and fulfill my requirement that if operational servers are found then a alert will show with the names and block the submission of catalog request and if no virtal server found then allow user to raise a catalog request without clicking two time on submit function onSubmit() { var scc = sessionStorage.getItem('scc') === 'true'; var scp = sessionStorage.getItem('scp') == 'true'; if(scc){ sessionStorage.removeItem('scc'); sessionStorage.removeItem('scp'); return scp; } var selectServer = g_form.getValue('select_server'); g_form.getReference('select_server', function(ref){ var ip_address = ref.ip_address; if(ip_address){ var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOpStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getParentNames'); ga.addParam('sysparm_ip_address', ip_address); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(response){ sessionStorage.setItem('scc', 'true'); var result = JSON.parse(response); if(result.length >0){ var names = result.join(', '); alert(\\"servers: \\" +names); g_form.clearValue('select_server'); sessionStorage.setItem('scp', 'false'); } else{ sessionStorage.setItem('scp', 'true'); } if(sessionStorage.getItem('scp') === 'true'){ g_form.submit(); } }); } }); return false; }","completion":"Your current script structure involves asynchronous processing (GlideAjax call to 'CheckOpStatus') to check the operational status of servers based on the IP address. Your requirement is to prevent form submission if there are operational servers found, showing an alert with their names. If no servers are found, you want to proceed with the form submission without requiring a second click on the submit button. The challenge you're encountering (needing two clicks to submit when no virtual server is found) results from the asynchronous nature of the \`GlideAjax\` call. The form submission proceeds (\`return false;\` is executed) before the Ajax response is received. When no virtual server is found, your code tries to submit the form again within the Ajax callback, but since the submission process has already been blocked (by \`return false;\`), it requires another click to initiate the submission again. One way to handle this is to restructure your approach to leverage client-side asynchronous handling more effectively, using a combination of flags and session storage to manage the form submission state across asynchronous checks. However, because GlideAjax is inherently asynchronous and your requirement involves halting form submission until the check completes, the exact behavior you desire (halt until response, then decide) is tricky within the onSubmit client script's synchronous flow without custom handling like below. Here's an adjusted approach to re-architect the script considering ServiceNow's client script execution environment: \`\`\`javascript function onSubmit() { var isServerCheckComplete = sessionStorage.getItem('scc') === 'true'; var isSubmissionAllowed = sessionStorage.getItem('scp') === 'true'; // Reset session state for fresh operation function resetSessionState() { sessionStorage.removeItem('scc'); sessionStorage.removeItem('scp'); } // If server check is complete, decide based on whether submission is allowed if (isServerCheckComplete) { resetSessionState(); // Always clear session state after check return isSubmissionAllowed; // Allow submission only if server check passed (no operational servers found) } else { // Perform the server check var selectServer = g_form.getValue('select_server'); g_form.getReference('select_server', function(ref) { var ip_address = ref.ip_address; if (ip_address) { var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOpStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getParentNames'); ga.addParam('sysparm_ip_address', ip_address); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(response) { var result = JSON.parse(response); sessionStorage.setItem('scc', 'true'); // Mark server check as complete if (result.length > 0) { var names = result.join(', '); alert(\\"Operational servers found: \\" + names); g_form.clearValue('select_server'); sessionStorage.setItem('scp', 'false'); } else { sessionStorage.setItem('scp', 'true'); g_form.submit(); // Directly submit if no operational servers found } }); } }); return false; // Initially prevent form submission to wait for Ajax response } } \`\`\` This script checks if the server operational status has already been validated. If not, it proceeds with the validation, and based on the validation result (i.e., operational servers are found or not), it either shows an alert and blocks submission or allows it. It leverages session storage to remember the state of validation and whether submission is allowed across the asynchronous callback. This solution aims to fulfill your requirement by structuring the asynchronous logic in a way that respects the synchronous onSubmit handler's constraints, allowing or blocking submission appropriately."},{"prompt":"code is working as expected but in below code condition when it go for else, it takes 2 click to submit the form. please modify if else condition is execute it will only take 1 click to submit else { sessionStorage.setItem(‘scp’, ‘true’); g_form.submit();","completion":"The challenge you're encountering arises from the asynchronous execution of the GlideAjax call, which doesn't complete before the form's default submission behavior (the first click). Your approach tries to bypass this by storing the state in \`sessionStorage\` and then, based on this stored state, deciding whether to submit the form again once the asynchronous call completes. However, because this check and state update occur too late in the form submission lifecycle, you end up needing an extra click to trigger the form submission check again and actually submit. One key issue with the pattern of putting \`g_form.submit();\` inside the GlideAjax callback is that it doesn't interfere with the initial form submission event's default behavior; it merely attempts to programmatically submit the form after the initial submission event has already been canceled (\`return false;\`). A revised approach involves preventing form submission unless a certain condition is met (check completed and servers not found). When conditions are not met, we hold the submission, perform our checks, and then programmatically allow the submission if the condition resolves positively in our asynchronous callback. The critical part is to ensure that when we decide to allow submission (no servers found in your case), it does without requiring a second click. To solve the two-click issue properly, you might have to restructure how and when you prompt for submission, given the reactive nature of client scripts to user actions in ServiceNow. Unfortunately, due to how ServiceNow client scripts and GlideAjax work together, there's no direct and clean solution to perform an async check in \`onSubmit\` and then continue with submission without some form of user interaction when async operations are involved. However, here's an updated conceptual workaround that tries to minimize the need for user re-interaction: \`\`\`javascript function onSubmit() { var asyncCheckCompleted = sessionStorage.getItem('asyncCheckCompleted') === 'true'; var allowSubmission = sessionStorage.getItem('allowSubmission') === 'true'; // Clear session storage to prevent unintended behavior on subsequent submissions function clearAsyncSessionItems() { sessionStorage.removeItem('asyncCheckCompleted'); sessionStorage.removeItem('allowSubmission'); } if (!asyncCheckCompleted) { // Perform the async check only if not done already checkServerStatus(function(shouldSubmit) { sessionStorage.setItem('asyncCheckCompleted', 'true'); sessionStorage.setItem('allowSubmission', shouldSubmit.toString()); if (shouldSubmit) { g_form.clearMessages(); // Clear existing messages to avoid confusion g_form.addInfoMessage(\\"No operational servers found, submitting form...\\"); // Trick to allow client-side re-evaluation of onSubmit. This is not a standard approach but aims to meet your requirements. setTimeout(function() { g_form.save(); // Attempt to save (submit) the form again }, 1000); // Delay to ensure user sees the message } else { g_form.addErrorMessage(\\"Operational servers found, cannot submit.\\"); clearAsyncSessionItems(); // Clear since we do not want to proceed } }); return false; // Prevent form submission to wait for the async check } else { clearAsyncSessionItems(); // Ensure clean-up to avoid affecting future submissions return allowSubmission; // Proceed based on the async check outcome } } function checkServerStatus(callback) { var ip_address = g_form.getValue('select_server'); // Assuming this is how you get your IP address if (ip_address) { var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOpStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getParentNames'); ga.addParam('sysparm_ip_address', ip_address); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(response) { var result = JSON.parse(response); var names = result.join(', '); if (result.length > 0) { alert(\\"Operational servers found: \\" + names); callback(false); // Do not allow submission } else { callback(true); // Allow submission } }); } else { // No IP address, callback based on your logic, assuming true (allow submission) callback(true); } } \`\`\` Please note: - Adjust the checkServerStatus function as per your actual implementation needs, especially how you retrieve and handle the \`ip_address\`. - This implementation introduces a slight delay to allow showing an info message before attempting to re-submit the form programmatically. Adjust the timing as you see fit. - This approach works around the limitation by effectively minimizing the undesired two-click behavior but doesn't completely eliminate the need for wise handling of asynchronous operations in the onSubmit event. It's a bit of a hack to reintroduce the form submission programmatically and should be used with understanding of the implications."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

One day, Edward has some good news for Trevor; the Fat Controller has asked that he be sent to the site of the new harbour to help out with the work. Trevor instantly perks up, excited about getting to work and meeting children. Edward brings him to the yard to meet Thomas. Upon meeting Trevor, Thomas, who is carrying metal pilings needed for the construction work, is initially skeptical of the newcomer. After Trevor’s flatbed is coupled to Thomas’ train, the two set off for the harbour. On the way, Trevor explains the many different types of work he can do and how he does not need rails to be useful. This helps Thomas understand Trevor better. The harbour is in complete disarray when Thomas and Trevor arrive; trucks are derailed and blocking the line and stone slabs are littered throughout the area. Thomas’ driver tells the two that the equipment Thomas is carrying is essential, so Trevor must go to work taking it around the mess. Trevor, who enjoys this kind of work, is happy to do the job as soon as he is off the flatbed. While Thomas moves the trucks, Trevor carries the construction equipment to where it is needed. Thomas later brings Annie and Clarabel to the harbour to meet Trevor and is left very impressed with Trevor after seeing him work so hard. This makes him finally understand just how useful a traction engine can truly be. Both Annie and Clarabel are carrying children, whom Trevor is more than happy to give rides to on the seaside. This is easily his favourite part of the day and Annie and Clarabel remark to each other how kind and gentle Trevor is and how he reminds them of Thomas. Thomas and Trevor are both very sorry when the day is over and Trevor has to return to the orchard. When parting ways at the junction, Thomas notices Trevor has a small tear in his eye. He pretends not to notice and cheers Trevor up by telling him that there is now plenty of work for him at the Vicarage and that he could be needed at the harbour again soon, which that makes Trevor feel better. That evening, Trevor thinks about the day’s events and the children before falling happily asleep.","completion":"At Wellsworth Vicarage Orchard, Trevor the Traction Engine was having an identity crisis. \\"Edward, I fear I'm about to become a garden ornament,\\" he sighed one gloomy afternoon. Edward, who had just been admiring his own reflection in a puddle, looked puzzled. \\"But Trevor, you're not shiny enough to be a decoration,\\" he replied helpfully. That's when Edward shared the exciting news about the harbour work. Trevor's spirits lifted faster than Sir Topham Hatt at an all-you-can-eat buffet. \\"The harbour? With actual work and real children? Oh, Edward, you've just saved me from a life of being a very large paperweight!\\" When Thomas met Trevor, he was a tad wary. \\"A traction engine? Do we really need something around that moves slower than a snail on a day off?\\" Thomas scoffed. But, as Trevor was hitched up to his train, he couldn't help but feel a spark of kinship. After all, they both had wheels, and that was a start. As they chugged toward the harbour, Trevor regaled Thomas with tales of his versatility. \\"You see, Thomas, I can do anything. Except fly. And swim. And run a marathon. But aside from that, anything!\\" Thomas wasn't sure whether to be impressed or amused. Upon their arrival, the scene was chaotic. Trucks were strewn about like toys in a toddler's playroom. \\"Well,\\" Thomas exclaimed, \\"This looks like my cab after a night out with the coaches!\\" Trevor, undeterred, leapt into action—or as much as a traction engine can leap—and began navigating the mess with surprising agility. As Trevor bustled around, Thomas couldn't hide his astonishment. \\"Blimey, he's like a bulldozer with a personality!\\" he remarked to anyone who would listen, which was primarily a bemused seagull. The highlight of Trevor's day was giving rides to the children. \\"Step right up, don't be shy! Experience the thrill of moving at the breathtaking speed of 5 miles per hour!\\" Trevor announced cheerfully. The children were thrilled, proving once again that in the absence of video games, even the slowest ride can be a hit. Annie and Clarabel, watching the scene unfold, nodded in approval. \\"He's just like Thomas, if Thomas were to trade his speed for a charming vintage vibe,\\" Clarabel whispered. Annie agreed, \\"And significantly less rushing about!\\" As the day wound down and Thomas and Trevor said their goodbyes, Trevor couldn't help but shed a tear. \\"I'll miss the harbour... and the chaos... and even the seagull that kept mistaking me for a snack,\\" he sniffled. Thomas, ever the friend, offered words of comfort. \\"Don't worry, Trevor. There's always chaos at the orchard. Last week, a cow wandered into the vegetable patch. It was anarchy!\\" This cheered Trevor up considerably, as nothing quite compared to the prospect of agricultural pandemonium.

One day, Percy is feeling particularly cheeky; he startles Gordon by telling him his morning train is ready, which makes Gordon think he is running late. Percy then pulls out to reveal a line of dirty coal trucks, which makes Gordon very angry. Gordon begins to think of a way to teach Percy a lesson. Next, Percy goes to James and tells him that the Fat Controller had sent a message for him to stay in the shed until he comes to see him. James is delighted, thinking the Fat Controller wants him to pull a special train and refuses to leave when his driver and fireman try to take him out. As a result, the other engines have to do James' work as well as their own, which makes them very angry. Finally, an engine inspector arrives to find out why James will not leave his shed; James tells him about the message the Fat Controller supposedly sent. The inspector points out the Fat Controller could not have sent a message as he is away for a week. Realising he was fooled, James is furious and quickly leaves to find Percy, but he has disappeared. When the Fat Controller returns, he tells both James and Percy off for causing trouble. One morning later, a careless yet cheeky Percy is boasting to Gordon and James that he is taking trucks to Thomas' junction. He believes that the Fat Controller chose him because he is a Really Useful Engine, though James thinks it is simply to keep him out of the way. Gordon - realising what route Percy is taking - indicates to James that they have a chance to give Percy a taste of his own medicine. They claim they were talking about being careful with the junction signals, especially \\"backing\\" ones. Keen to show off, Percy claims that he knows all about signals but he worries as he has never heard of backing signals before. Percy soon arrives at a signal set to \\"danger\\" but then sees the arm move to \\"line clear\\". Percy is surprised when it moves up instead of down, having never seen anything like it before. Knowing that down means \\"go\\" and up means \\"stop\\", he guesses upper still means \\"go back\\" and believes that it is a \\"backing\\" signal Gordon and James were discussing. Percy begins reversing but his driver quickly stops him. Percy insists that it is a \\"backing\\" signal and tells him what Gordon and James had said. The driver tells Percy the truth about signals that go further up, which makes him eager to leave before he is seen, but is too late as Gordon goes past with the Express and sees that Percy fell for the trick. Humiliated, Percy quickly and quietly finishes his work. That night in the sheds, Gordon and James talk about signals; while they think it is funny, Percy thinks they are being very silly.","completion":"[Scene: The Big Station Yard.

Public law relates to the state and is concerned with laws which govern processes in local and national government conflicts between an individual and the state. Private law is concerned with the relationships between individuals and corporations, and includes family law, contract law, property law, etc. Criminal law deals with certain forms of conduct for which the state reserves punishment, for example murder or theft. The state prosecutes the offender. Civil law concerns relationships between private persons, their rights and duties. It also deals with the conduct which may give rise to a claim by a legal person for compensation or injunction. When it comes to prosecution under the laws of the country it's common to speak about criminal offence but civil wrongs. Criminal and civil proceedings are usually very different. In a criminal proceeding a prosecutor prosecutes a defendant. If the verdict is \\"guilty\\", the defendant is convicted. He will have a criminal record for the crime and will be punished by one of a variety of punishments ranging from life imprisonment to a fine, which is paid to a court. If the defendant is found \\"not guilty\\" , he is acquitted and allowed to leave court without punishment. In civil cases a claimant sues a defendant or brings a claim against him. The proceeding may result in judgement for the claimant, which means that the defendant is found liable and the judge may order the defendant to pay damages. The duty to prove a case is called the burden of proof. In criminal cases the burden of proof falls on the prosecution. In other words it's the duty of the prosecution to prove guilt, the defendant doesn't have to prove his innocence. This principle is called the presumption of innocence, which means that every person charged with a criminal offence is considered to be innocent until proved guilty. The degree of proof which makes the court sure that the person is guilty is called the standard of proof. The standard of proof is higher in a criminal action than in a civil one since the penalties are stricter. In a criminal case a prosecution must prove the guilt of a criminal \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\", which means that the prosecution must make the court sure that the defendant committed the crime. If the court is not sure or has a reason for the doubt, it must acquit the defendant. In a civil action the burden of proof is on the claimant. He is required to prove his case \\"on a balance of probabilities\\", i.e. to show that his case is more probable than not. But he doesn't have to make the court sure about it; it's enough to show that the defendant was probably guilty. One and the same offence may sometimes result in both kinds of prosecution, civil and criminal. For example, the driver who injured a passer-by will not only face criminal penalties imposed by a criminal court but may have to pay compensation for injuries ordered by a civil court. ответить на контрольные вопросы по тексту кратко: Задание4.

Различие между гражданским правом и уголовным правом более важно для практикующих юристов, потому что это различие непосредственно влияет на юридические процедуры, бремя и стандарт доказывания, а также на итоги для их клиентов, что тесно связано с практическими аспектами юридической практики в Великобритании. 2. Уголовное право занимается поведением, за которое государство наказывает (как убийство или кража), где государство выступает в качестве обвинителя, в то время как гражданское право касается отношений между частными лицами, регулируя права, обязанности и споры, которые могут привести к искам о компенсации или предоставлении судебных запретов. 3. Если обвиняемый признан виновным в уголовном праве, он приговаривается к наказанию, получает судимость и подвергается различным видам наказания от штрафов до пожизненного заключения. 4. Если обвиняемый признан невиновным, он оправдывается, что позволяет ему покинуть суд без наказания. 5. Если процедура в гражданском деле завершается решением в пользу истца, это значит, что ответчик признан ответственным, и судья может приказать ответчику выплатить ущерб истцу. 6. Презумпция невиновности означает, что каждый человек, обвиняемый в уголовном преступлении, считается невиновным до тех пор, пока его вина не будет доказана обвинением. 7. \\"Бремя доказывания\\" относится к обязанности стороны доказать свои утверждения в ходе процесса (в уголовных делах это лежит на обвинении, в гражданских делах – на истце). \\"Стандарт доказательства\\" относится к уровню уверенности и качеству доказательств, требуемым для установления доказательств в суде, что варьируется между уголовными и гражданскими делами. 8.

The notes in your measure are C, E, and G, forming a C major chord. To change the measure to 4/4 while keeping the harmonic content essentially the same, we can simply extend the durations of the notes, add more notes, or introduce a rhythmic variation that fills the measure. Here's a straightforward option, extending the duration of the notes: Given Measure in 2/4: |:C E2 G2 :| Converted to 4/4, Option 1 (Extending Durations): |:C1 E2 G2 C2 :| This option involves extending the duration of the first C note to a whole note (C1) assuming that extending durations is within the scope of your request (it's somewhat unclear how you want to \\"change to 4\\"). This fills the 4/4 measure with notes of the C major chord, maintaining the original harmony while extending over the longer measure. However, if you meant to keep the energy and not extend the actual pitches' duration but rather add to the measure by including more notes or a variation, here's another approach: Option 2 (Adding Notes for Rhythmic Variation): |:C E G E C2 E2 G2 :| In this option, the measure starts with a quick C, E, G, E progression, each as eighth notes, followed by half notes for C, E, and G. This maintains the original triad while adding more rhythmic content to fill the measure. The original harmony is preserved, and the measure's rhythm becomes more intricate. Please note that musical notation conversion can vary depending on the intended stylistic outcome, the piece's overall context, and personal or directorial preference. The above examples aim to maintain the original chord (C major) while adapting to a longer measure."},{"prompt":"|:C1 E2 G2 C2 :| diffrent the things","completion":"To offer a different variant for converting a musical measure to a 4/4 time signature while incorporating the notes C, E, G, and then revisiting C, let's create more diversity in rhythm and possibly introduce inversions or passing tones to add interest. We'll keep the harmonic content centered around C major but introduce some variety in rhythm and note order. Given the original framework and your request for difference, let's try another approach that introduces different rhythms and potentially an inversion or a passing tone for musical interest. The goal is to fill a 4/4 measure with a bit more creativity: **Option 3 (Adding Rhythmic Variety and Inversion):** |: C E G E G C G E :| In this version: - We begin with a quarter note C, followed by an eighth note E, an eighth note G, then another eighth note E, creating a quick melodic motion. - We continue with an eighth note G, return to a C for a quarter note maintaining the root of the C major chord as a focal point, and then proceed with an eighth note G followed by an eighth note E to conclude the measure. This pattern creates a more rhythmic variety within the 4/4 time signature, making the measure more engaging while staying true to the original chord tones. This approach can add a more lively texture to the piece, especially if contrast and variety are desired. **Option 4 (Rhythm and Passing Tone):** |: C2 E G A G E C2 :| In this measure: - We start with a half note C, spending more time on the tonic note for emphasis. - We then ascend briefly through the chord with an eighth note E, an eighth note G, and introduce an A as a passing tone (adding a momentary step outside the triad for melodic interest) with an eighth note duration. - Descend back down to G and E with eighth notes, before concluding on the tonic C again with a half note. This structure provides not only rhythmic variety but also introduces a non-chord tone (A) as a melodic approach to enrich the harmony briefly. The passing tone creates a moment of tension that resolves as the melody descends back to C, adding depth to the musical phrase. Each option focuses on different elements of musical composition—rhythmic diversity, melodic interest through inversion and passing tones—all while fundamentally preserving the C major harmony."},{"prompt":"|:C1 E2 G2 C2 :| diffrent the things, don't want two C.","completion":"If you're looking for variation within the scope of a 4/4 measure, based on the notes C, E, G, and avoiding repetition of the note C, we can introduce a mixture of rhythmic and melodic variations that keep the harmonic structure interesting. Let's explore a couple of options under those constraints: # Option 1: Introduction of a Different Note and Rhythm |: E2 G2 A2 G2 :| In this version: - The measure starts with a half-note E, followed by a half-note G, enhancing the sense of progression within the C major chord framework. - Then, introducing an A as a whole step above G adds tension and a sense of forward motion, assuming A as a passing or neighboring tone that enriches the melody without altering the fundamental harmonic context of C major. - The measure resolves back to G with another half-note, creating a smooth descent back into the chord’s familiar territory. # Option 2: Syncopation and Variation |: E2 G C G B G :| Adding syncopation and a bit of melodic variation can create a more rhythmically engaging line: - The measure starts with a half-note E, immediately giving prominence to a different chord tone. - The G follows as a quarter note, creating a quicker move to the root note C, played as an eighth note, adding a slight syncopated feel. - Returning to G as an eighth note maintains the rhythmic momentum, and introducing B (the major seventh in relation to C) as an eighth note adds a bit of harmonic tension and interest. - The measure concludes with G as a quarter note, creating a sense of closure while emphasizing the triad’s dominant note. # Option 3: Rhythmic Diversity Without Repetition of C |: E1 G2 F#2 G2 :| Here's a more creative take: - Begins with a whole note E, focusing on the third of the C major chord for a sustained period, which shifts the emphasis and gives a sense of space. - Then, a half-note G moves the melody upwards smoothly within the chord framework. - Intriguingly introducing an F# as a half-note adds a chromatic passing tone that creates a brief, momentary tension, leading back into the key. - The measure returns to G, this time as a half-note, to resolve the tension and solidify the tonal center. These variations provide different ways to approach a 4/4 measure with the given notes and constraints, keeping the musical content fresh and engaging without repeating the note C, and adhering to your directive for diverse elements within the framework."},{"prompt":"C B2 G2 change to 4","completion":"To expand the phrase |: C B2 G2 :| into a 4/4 time signature while incorporating more diversity, let's create variations that fill out the measure with engaging rhythms and harmonic interest. This original phrase suggests a descending motion, possibly implying a mix of the C major and G major chords. Let's explore a few creative ways to develop this into a full 4/4 measure: # Option 1: Extended Melodic Development |: C E G B, C2 B2 A G :| In this version: - Begin with an ascending arpeggio from C to B (C, E, G, B), using quarter notes. This outlines a Cmaj7 chord and creates a smooth upward motion. - Follow this ascent with C and B as half notes, sustaining the melody and highlighting the major seventh interval. - Conclude the measure with a descending motion to A and G (as quarter notes), adding a sense of resolution and connecting to a G major chord, providing a nice contrast. # Option 2: Rhythmic Variation and Syncopation |: C4 B2 A2 G4 :| - Start with a whole note C, giving a strong tonic emphasis at the beginning. - Proceed with half notes on B and A, creating a descending melodic line that adds a bit of tension and release. - Finish the measure with a whole note G, providing a strong sense of resolution and closure, while the rhythmic variation maintains interest. # Option 3: Adding Passing Tones and Harmony |: C D E G, A2 G2 F# G :| - Begin with a quick C to G movement (C, D, E, G as eighth notes), creating an ascending scalar passage that brightens the melody. - Use half notes on A and G, making a brief melodic statement that smoothly transitions down. - Include a passing tone (F# as a quarter note) just before ending on G (as a quarter note), adding a chromatic touch that resolves pleasingly back to G, enriching the harmonic palette. # Option 4: Harmonic Emphasis with Chord Tones |: C3 B G A, G2 F# G :| - Initiate with a dotted half note on C, placing a strong emphasis on the tonic note for a prolonged presence. - Follow with a quick downward sweep from B to A (as quarter notes), touching upon the G major chord tones. - End the measure with a rhythmic figure, G to F# and back to G as half notes, creating tension with the F# leading tone before resolving it back to the G, enhancing the sense of movement and resolution within the context of G major. These options provide a variety of ways to stretch and creatively adapt your initial phrase into a 4/4 measure, adding melodic interest, rhythmic dynamism, and harmonic depth. Each version explores different techniques to achieve a musically satisfying extension that enriches the initial idea."},{"prompt":"Am7 A2 E2 change to 4","completion":"To change the progression Am7 - A2 - E2 into a 4/4 time signature with more development or variation while keeping it musically coherent and interesting, we can introduce additional rhythmic values, passing tones, or even extend the harmonic content slightly. Given that Am7 suggests a jazzy or contemporary sound, let’s explore some creative options to fill the measure, keeping in mind the harmonic context suggested by your initial progression. # Option 1: Adding Rhythmic Interest |: Am7 A (E G# C) E2 A2 :| Here's a breakdown: - Start with an Am7 chord to establish the tonality (quarter note duration for brevity). - Follow with an A chord (suggestive of A2, resolved into a simple A major for a moment) as a quarter note to maintain harmonic structure. - Introduce an E major chord inversion, notated here as (E G# C), played as triplet eighth notes to add a rhythmic twist and quickly touch upon the E major tonality. - Conclude with half notes on E and the root A to round off the measure back in A minor's context, giving a sense of return and closure within the 4/4 structure. # Option 2: Melodic Line Enhancement |: Am7 C B A G# A E2 :| In this approach: - Begin with the Am7 chord for an eighth note, quickly establishing the minor tonality. - Proceed to ascend melodically from C to A using eighth notes, creating a smooth, linear movement. - Insert a quick G# before returning to A, incorporating a leading tone that creates tension and interest, hinting at the E major chord. - Finish the measure with a half note E, giving a nod to the E2 chord, and providing a sense of resolution. # Option 3: Harmonic Expansion |: Am7 Bm7 E7 Am E/G# A/C# D E :| Expanding harmonically provides a richer tapestry: - Start with the Am7 chord to establish the key. - Move to a Bm7 as a passing chord to add depth and a smooth transition into E7, all quarter notes, enhancing the progression with a secondary dominant that resolves back to Am. - Include an Am chord followed by an E/G# (inversion of E major) for a bass-led movement, followed by A/C# (implying A2) as passing chords to enrich the journey back to tonic, utilizing quarter notes for these transitions. - Finish the measure with a D major to E major chord change, using the D as a simple passing or setup chord that leads effectively back into the E chord, signaling an interesting harmonic return or progression forward. # Option 4: Syncopation and Extended Harmony |: Am7 (A C) E G (B G#) A2 :| This version uses syncopation for a dynamic feel: - Stick with the Am7 for two beats, ensuring the minor tonality is well-established. - Break into syncopated rhythm with the A and C notes quarter notes, suggesting an A minor feel with a melody overlaid. - Hit the E note followed by G, as eighth notes, hinting at an E minor to maintain fluid motion. - Introduce B and G# as syncopated eighth notes, adding tension with a quick reach towards E major's leading tone. - Conclude with an A2 (A and B notes) held as a half note, letting the progression breathe and inviting further development or resolution in the next measure.

Here, the intention is to keep the original chord progression's essence but explore different rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic textures to create a more compelling musical narrative. # Option 1: Rhythmic and Melodic Expansion |: F E F G A F C Dm G C A :| Breaking it down: - Start with the F note as a quarter note to establish our tonal foundation. - Add a quick flourish with E - F - G - A as sixteenth notes, creating a melodic ascent that adds excitement. - Drop back to F as a quarter note to ground the melody, followed closely by a rhythmic transition through C - Dm - G using eighth notes, thus implying a slight detour through related harmonies. - Conclude the measure with a C to A as quarter notes, reiterating the original harmonic suggestion but enriching it with added context. # Option 2: Harmonic Filling with Suspended Sounds |: F Fsus2 F/A Gsus4 G C/E A7sus4 A7 :| Here's another perspective: - Begin directly on the F chord (whole note) for a solid foundation. - Proceed to introduce a Fsus2 quickly followed by an F/A, creating movement within the F major tonality; play these as quarter notes. - Transition through a Gsus4 to G, quarter notes as well, to maintain melodic interest and a sense of anticipation. - Finish the progression with a C/E to A7sus4, moving to A7, which fills the latter half of the measure with lush, resolving suspended harmonies turning back to A major, played as quarter notes to steady the rhythm. # Option 3: Contrapuntal Approach With Bass Motion |: F A C Dm/F F G A Bb C A :| Here’s how it can go: - Open with the F as a whole note, setting a strong statement of the root. - Introduce ascending motion with A - C as eighth notes, immediately adding a countermelody or contrapuntal interest. - Move into a Dm/F, signifying a minor coloration over the F bass, then return to F, both as eighth notes, yielding a quick, rich harmonic texture. - Glide through a sequence of G - A - Bb - C, representing a scalar rise as eighth notes, producing tension and motion. - Cap off the measure with a return to A as a quarter note, grounding the melodic excursion within the context of F's dominant, suggesting readiness for resolution or continuation. # Option 4: Adding Pace and Drive |: F C F G A F G C A7 :| To add pace: - Initiate on the F chord (half note), immediately bringing a sense of resolution. - Swiftly move through C back to F, quarter notes, indicating a brief harmonic journey. - Engage G - A - F as eighth notes, injecting a quick, lively sequence that elevates the progression. - Propel towards the end with G - C - A7 as quarter notes, offering a robust closure that hints at both resolution and potential development ahead, especially with the tension of A7 beckoning further exploration. Each option provided aims to enrich the initial F - C2 - A2 idea by bringing varied rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic landscapes into play, achieving a dynamic and stirring 4/4 measure conducive to different musical settings and moods."},{"prompt":"请帮我翻译：“说明：历史记录列表中第2列表示对应编号的检测次数，第3列表示对应编号的有效检测次数;”","completion":"Explanation: The second column in the history record list indicates the number of detections corresponding to the ID, and the third column indicates the number of valid detections corresponding to the ID."},{"prompt":"can affect every aspect of a business relationship. important to explore the various aspects of culture.

One day, Percy is feeling particularly cheeky; he startles Gordon by telling him his morning train is ready, which makes Gordon think he is running late. Percy then pulls out to reveal a line of dirty coal trucks, which makes Gordon very angry. Gordon begins to think of a way to teach Percy a lesson. Next, Percy goes to James and tells him that the Fat Controller had sent a message for him to stay in the shed until he comes to see him. James is delighted, thinking the Fat Controller wants him to pull a special train and refuses to leave when his driver and fireman try to take him out. As a result, the other engines have to do James’ work as well as their own, which makes them very angry. Finally, an engine inspector arrives to find out why James will not leave his shed; James tells him about the message the Fat Controller supposedly sent. The inspector points out the Fat Controller could not have sent a message as he is away for a week. Realising he was fooled, James is furious and quickly leaves to find Percy, but he has disappeared. When the Fat Controller returns, he tells both James and Percy off for causing trouble. One morning later, a careless yet cheeky Percy is boasting to Gordon and James that he is taking trucks to Thomas’ junction. He believes that the Fat Controller chose him because he is a Really Useful Engine, though James thinks it is simply to keep him out of the way. Gordon - realising what route Percy is taking - indicates to James that they have a chance to give Percy a taste of his own medicine. They claim they were talking about being careful with the junction signals, especially “backing” ones. Keen to show off, Percy claims that he knows all about signals but he worries as he has never heard of backing signals before. Percy soon arrives at a signal set to “danger” but then sees the arm move to “line clear”. Percy is surprised when it moves up instead of down, having never seen anything like it before. Knowing that down means “go” and up means “stop”, he guesses upper still means “go back” and believes that it is a “backing” signal Gordon and James were discussing. Percy begins reversing but his driver quickly stops him. Percy insists that it is a “backing” signal and tells him what Gordon and James had said. The driver tells Percy the truth about signals that go further up, which makes him eager to leave before he is seen, but is too late as Gordon goes past with the Express and sees that Percy fell for the trick.

Discovered by the Polish-Austrian astronomer Antoni Przybylski in 1961, this star has garnered attention due to its peculiar chemical composition, which significantly deviates from that of typical stars, including our Sun. Przybylski's Star is classified as an Ap (peculiar A-type) star, which means it is a type of chemically peculiar star with a strong magnetic field. However, what makes Przybylski's Star stand out even among other peculiar stars is its abundance of heavy and rare earth elements. Spectral analysis reveals unusually high concentrations of elements like lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium. Even more strikingly, it contains short-lived radioactive elements such as promethium, which is not normally observed in stellar spectra because of its rapid decay. Another distinctive feature of Przybylski's Star is the hypothesized presence of elements heavier than uranium, such as actinium, thorium, and possibly even elements from the island of stability (a term referring to a set of hypothesized superheavy elements that might have much longer half-lives than the typically short-lived heavy elements). The unusual abundance of heavy and rare elements raises intriguing questions about the formation and evolutionary history of this star. One theory suggests that the peculiar abundances might result from the star capturing material from a nearby supernova explosion early in its life. Another theory proposes that the high amount of heavy elements could be the result of a unique process of stellar nucleosynthesis, possibly involving the star's strong magnetic field. Przybylski's Star's extreme chemical peculiarities challenge our understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, marking it as an object of ongoing interest and study within the astronomical community. Its study may offer insights into the processes that can lead to such unusual stellar chemistries and contribute to our broader understanding of stellar physics."},{"prompt":"Describe 33 Polyhymnia","completion":"33 Polyhymnia is an asteroid in the Main Asteroid Belt, which is the region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the majority of our solar system's asteroids are found. It was discovered on October 28, 1854, by the French astronomer Jean Chacornac and is named after Polyhymnia, the Muse of sacred poetry, sacred hymn, dance, and eloquence in Greek mythology. The naming convention of asteroids after mythological figures was common practice at the time and continues to be a tradition in astronomy. With an average diameter of about 60 kilometres (or around 37 miles), 33 Polyhymnia is relatively small when compared to some of the largest objects in the Main Belt. It belongs to the S-type (silicaceous) asteroids, indicating that its composition primarily consists of silicate minerals and metal. S-type asteroids are among the most common types in the inner part of the asteroid belt. The surface, composition, and characteristics of 33 Polyhymnia, like many other asteroids, offer valuable insights into the conditions of the early solar system. Studying these objects can help astronomers understand more about the processes that led to the formation of the planets and the history of our solar system. Asteroids such as 33 Polyhymnia are of particular interest not only to scientists studying the formation and evolution of the solar system but also to those looking at the potential for asteroid mining and assessing the risk of asteroid impacts on Earth. Through missions to asteroids, including Japan's Hayabusa missions and NASA's OSIRIS-REx, researchers are starting to gather direct samples from these ancient space rocks, providing invaluable data that cannot be obtained by remote observations alone. As of my last update in 2023, there has been no specific mission to 33 Polyhymnia, but ongoing observations and studies of asteroids across the Main Belt continue to refine our understanding of these fascinating objects."},{"prompt":"Describe polyhymnium, chemical element with 164 atomic number","completion":"As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, there is no chemical element with the atomic number 164 that is officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The periodic table of elements, as widely accepted and used in the scientific community, includes elements up to atomic number 118, named oganesson (Og). Oganesson is currently the heaviest element officially recognized, and it completes the 7th period of the periodic table. The notion of an element with an atomic number of 164 falls into the realm of theoretical and superheavy elements, which lie beyond the current known and synthesized elements. Superheavy elements, especially those hypothesized to exist in the so-called \\"island of stability,\\" are of great scientific interest. The island of stability refers to a predicted region in the periodic table where superheavy elements with certain numbers of protons and neutrons might have significantly longer half-lives compared to other heavy elements, which typically decay in mere fractions of a second. These elements, including one hypothetically with an atomic number of 164, are the subject of theoretical studies and have not yet been observed or synthesized. Scientists believe that the island of stability may begin around element 114 or 120 and could include elements with higher atomic numbers. However, producing such elements would require highly sophisticated experimental setups and reactions, involving the collision of lighter nuclei to create heavier ones in particle accelerators. Research into superheavy elements is ongoing, with scientists hoping to synthesize new elements that lie within or beyond the anticipated island of stability.

Отмечу, что предоставление точных таймкодов без доступа к конкретной копии фильма может быть сложно, но я могу описать несколько впечатляющих моментов, которые вы могли бы искать при просмотре. 1. **Момент, когда главный герой наступает на мину** – Этот момент является ключевым для всего сюжета фильма. Главный герой, стоя на мине, осознает, что любое неосторожное движение может стоить ему жизни. Это становится началом его психологического испытания на выживание. Этот момент обычно следует в первой трети фильма. 2. **Встреча с бедуином** – В какой-то момент фильма главный герой встречает бедуина, перемещающегося по пустыне. Этот момент важен для развития сюжета, так как бедуин делится с главным героем мудростью и помогает ему взглянуть на свою ситуацию под другим углом. 3. **Галлюцинации и воспоминания** – Пребывание в изоляции и экстремальные условия пустыни вызывают у главного героя галлюцинации и воспоминания о его прошлом. Эти моменты не только добавляют глубины персонажу, но и позволяют зрителю узнать его лучше. 4. **Попытка самоспасения** – Главный герой делает инженерное устройство в попытке освободить себя от минной ловушки. Этот момент подчеркивает его интеллект, ресурсность и желание выжить, несмотря на обстоятельства. 5. **Конец фильма** – Разрешение исхода ситуации с миной и главного героя. Этот момент полон напряжения и эмоциональной разгрузки, поскольку зрители наконец узнают, удастся ли главному герою выжить. Имейте в виду, что указание точного времени этих моментов может варьироваться в зависимости от редакции фильма.

However, without additional context, it's challenging to provide a specific answer. If the sequence or pattern is related to a specific notation in a game, coding language, or puzzle, could you please offer more details? For instance, knowing if \\"C B2 G2\\" represents musical notes, variables in a coding puzzle, or steps in a logic game would be crucial to accurately translating or modifying it to \\"4.\\" If you're looking at a simple alphanumeric conversion where \\"C\\" is the 3rd letter of the alphabet, \\"B\\" is the 2nd, and \\"G\\" is the 7th, and considering \\"2\\" as a value to be added or as a repetition indicator, the approach would be very different from interpreting them as part of a music sheet or programming syntax. Could you provide more information or clarify the context of your question?"},{"prompt":"F C2 A2 change to 4","completion":"If \\"F C2 A2\\" is meant to be transformed into \\"4\\" based on a specified pattern, rule, or context that hasn't been fully explained, we'll need to make some assumptions to interpret your request. If the pattern involves music, coding, a puzzle, or some form of sequential logic, the exact nature of the transformation isn't completely clear without more details. However, I can venture a guess based on a common pattern recognition approach: Given the sequence \\"F C2 A2\\" changes to \\"4,\\" it seems like we're looking for a pattern or rule that could apply to both cases (the given sequence and the number \\"4\\"). Without a clear explanation of the rules governing the transformation, here are a couple of speculative interpretations: # Musical Interpretation If the letters and numbers refer to music notes and octaves (where \\"F\\" is a note, and \\"C2\\", \\"A2\\" indicate notes C and A in the 2nd octave), directly translating this into a single number like \\"4\\" isn't straightforward without knowing the specific context or rule intended (e.g., counting intervals, summing note frequencies, etc.). # Alphanumeric Conversion Considering an alphanumeric interpretation where letters are converted to numbers based on their position in the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), and assuming \\"C2 A2\\" means something specific to a rule or system you're using: - F = 6th letter of the alphabet - C = 3rd letter of the alphabet - A = 1st letter of the alphabet Without a clear pattern or rule for the transformation (e.g., adding, multiplying), it’s challenging to see how \\"4\\" is derived directly. However, if there were a pattern where the numbers next to the letters (like the \\"2\\"s in \\"C2 A2\\") influenced the calculation, it wasn't explicitly provided. # Logical or Cryptographic Interpretation In puzzles or cryptography, \\"F C2 A2\\" might represent a cipher or a step in logic. With \\"change to 4,\\" you could be indicating a result after applying a rule, decryption, or simplification. This could involve mathematical operations, letter-to-number conversions, or even a more abstract rule. To provide a specific and accurate interpretation, I'd need more context or a clearer explanation of the rules or systems involved in your query. Could you offer more details on what \\"F C2 A2\\" represents and how it should relate to \\"4\\"?"},{"prompt":"Can people with hemorrhoids stage 4 driving long time?","completion":"People with stage 4 hemorrhoids (which are permanently prolapsed and cannot be manually reinserted) may find long periods of sitting, such as during driving, to be particularly uncomfortable or even painful. The discomfort arises because sitting, especially on harder surfaces or for extended periods, can place additional pressure on the affected area, exacerbating symptoms like pain, swelling, and possibly even bleeding. However, whether a person with stage 4 hemorrhoids can endure long driving periods would heavily depend on: 1. **The severity of their symptoms:** Some individuals might experience intense pain and discomfort that could make long drives nearly impossible without frequent breaks, while others might have milder symptoms that are more manageable. 2. **Management strategies:** Utilizing various management strategies could make driving more comfortable. This could include: - Using a cushion specially designed to relieve pressure on the pelvic floor. - Taking regular breaks to stand and move around, which can help reduce pressure and improve circulation. - Over-the-counter or prescription medications to manage pain and reduce inflammation. 3. **Medical advice:** It's crucial for anyone experiencing severe hemorrhoids to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. A medical professional can provide guidance tailored to an individual's specific condition and needs, including whether it's advisable to undertake long drives and what strategies could help manage symptoms during such activities. 4. **Lifestyle adjustments:** Beyond the immediate concern of driving, individuals with severe hemorrhoids are often advised to consider various lifestyle adjustments to manage their condition better and potentially reduce the severity of their symptoms. This could include dietary changes to avoid constipation, regular exercise, and avoiding prolonged sitting when possible. In conclusion, while it's not impossible for someone with stage 4 hemorrhoids to drive for a long time, it would likely require careful planning, pain management strategies, and possibly adjustments based on medical advice to do so comfortably."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Распределите приведенные ниже глаголы по группам в зависимости от значения Глаголы, обозначающие Глаголы, обозначающие физическое ощущение или состояние психическое состояние человека или живого существа Без постфикса -ся С постфиксом ся Темнеет, хочется, рвет, светает, работается, холодеет, не сидится, морозит, живется, заволакивает, звенит, привидится, тошнит, дышится, вздумается, вечереет, читается, брезжит, бвется, знобит, годится, чешется, шумит, спится, стреляет, холодаетASSISTANT: Давайте разделим эти глаголы в соответствии с указанными критериями:<br/><br/># Глаголы, обозначающие физическое ощущение или состояние:<br/><br/><strong>Без постфикса -ся:</strong><br/>- Рвет<br/>- Морозит<br/>- Знобит<br/>- Холодает<br/><br/><strong>С постфиксом -ся:</strong><br/>- Хочется<br/>- Светает<br/>- Холодеет<br/>- Звенит<br/>- Тошнит<br/>- Чешется<br/>- Брезжит<br/>- Вздумается (может быть интерпретирован как психическое состояние в зависимости от контекста)<br/><br/># Глаголы, обозначающие психическое состояние человека или живого существа:<br/><br/><strong>Без постфикса -ся:</strong><br/>- Шумит<br/>- Стреляет<br/><br/><strong>С постфиксом -ся:</strong><br/>- Привидится<br/>- Дышится (может быть интерпретирован как физическое ощущение в зависимости от контекста)<br/><br/># Глаголы, которые могут быть отнесены к обеим категориям в зависимости от контекста или сложно классифицировать однозначно по вашей схеме:<br/><br/><strong>Без постфикса -ся:</strong><br/>- Шумит<br/>- Вечереет<br/>- Темнеет<br/>- Заволакивает<br/>- Светает<br/><br/><strong>С постфиксом -ся:</strong><br/>- Работается<br/>- Не сидится<br/>- Живется<br/>- Читается<br/>- Бвется<br/>- Спится<br/>- Годится<br/><br/>Эти глаголы могут обозначать как внутренние состояния, так и внешние условия или действия, которые могут вызвать определённые ощущения или состояния.

Это произведение относится к тем, где Мандельштам осмысливает историческую эпоху, своё место и роль интеллектуала в обществе, сталкивающегося с разрушительной силой тоталитарного режима. Стихотворение характеризуется ярко выраженной аллегоричностью и символизмом. \\"Век мой, зверь мой\\" – это метафора, образно передающая дикость и агрессивность эпохи, которая выражается через образ \\"зверя\\". Мандельштам в своём творчестве нередко использует зоологические образы для описания социальных и политических процессов, таких как деперсонализация личности, подавление свободы слова и мысли, культура насилия и страха. Стихотворение проникнуто ощущением личной ответственности поэта за судьбу страны и культуры, за сохранение человечности и духовных ценностей в мире, где царит беззаконие и жестокость. В его строках прослеживается и идея прощания с уходящим миром культуры и просвещения, который насильно заменяется идеологией коллективизма и унификации мышления. Анализируя поэтические средства, стоит отметить использование Мандельштамом разнообразных ритмо-стилистических фигур, таких как аллитерация, ассонанс, метафоры и сравнения, что делает текст многозначительным и многогранным. Через эти поэтические средства Мандельштам стремится передать сложность и многообразие восприятия эпохи, а также глубину своего переживания и рефлексии. \\"Век мой, зверь мой\\" является одним из ярчайших примеров гражданской лирики Мандельштама, демонстрирующим его мастерство привлечения литературного таланта для осмысления и размышления о сложных и трагических аспектах исторической действительности."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
