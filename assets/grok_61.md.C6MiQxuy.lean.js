Specifically, the circle intersects the sides at points (E, F, G, H, I, J, K) and (L). - The diameter perpendicular to (AB) and (CD) will intersect the square at points (A, C), and likewise, the other diameter will intersect at (B, D). 3. **Dividing the Arcs:** - The two diameters divide the circle into four equal quadrants. Each pair of opposing quadrants contains two arcs. - Because these diameters are both perpendicular to each other and parallel to the sides of the square, they also bisect the arcs they create. 4. **Lengths of Arcs:** - Each quadrant has the same total arc length. Therefore, the arcs (EF) and (IJ) combined span across two of these quadrants. - Similarly, the arcs (GH) and (KL) combined also span across two quadrants. 5. **Conclusion:** - Since the total arc length of a circle is (2pi) radians (or 360 degrees), and the quadrants are equally divided by the diameters, the sum of the lengths of arcs (EF) and (IJ) must be equal to the sum of the lengths of arcs (GH) and (KL).

According to the given conditions, the circle passes through points A(1, 0) and B(0, 1). Therefore, we have: 1. Substituting A(1, 0) into the equation gives 1^2 + 0^2 + Dcdot1 + Ecdot0 + F = 0, which simplifies to 1 + D + F = 0. 2. Substituting B(0, 1) into the equation gives 0^2 + 1^2 + Dcdot0 + Ecdot1 + F = 0, which simplifies to 1 + E + F = 0. The chord on the x-axis implies that the center of the circle, (frac{-D}{2}, frac{-E}{2}), is at a distance equal to half the chord length from each endpoint of the chord. Since the chord length is 6, its half is 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the x-axis is equal to 3. The x-coordinate of the center must be frac{6}{2} = 3 units away from the x-intercept(s) of the circle. The distance from the center (frac{-D}{2}, frac{-E}{2}) to the x-axis (y=0) is solely determined by the y-coordinate, which is |frac{-E}{2}| = 3. Since the y-coordinate of the center is, in absolute value, equal to 3, we get frac{-E}{2} = 3 or frac{-E}{2} = -3, leading to E = -6 or E = 6. Now, the distance from the center to the x-axis is the same as the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the center, thus we get |frac{-E}{2}| = 3 Rightarrow |E| = 6. This gives us two scenarios: 1. frac{-E}{2} = 3 Rightarrow E = -6 or 2. frac{-E}{2} = -3 Rightarrow E = 6. Using the fact that the distance to the x-intercepts (where y=0) is equal to 3, we apply the quadratic formula to x^2 + Dx + F = 0, giving x = frac{-D pm sqrt{D^2-4F}}{2}. Since the overall distance between the two x-intercepts is 6, we get sqrt{D^2-4F} = 6. Substituting E = -6 (or E = 6) and the other equations into the conditions, we can solve the following set of equations: begin{cases} 1 + D + F = 0, 1 + E + F = 0, sqrt{D^2 - 4F} = 6, end{cases} Solving these, we get two possible solutions: begin{cases} D = -5, E = -6, F = 5, end{cases} and begin{cases} D = -1, E = 6, F = -6. end{cases} Therefore, the equations of the desired circles are x^2 + y^2 - 5x - 6y + 5 = 0 and x^2 + y^2 - x + 6y - 6 = 0.

For large ( n ), we approximate ( n+1 approx n ). Thus: [ n a_{n+1} approx n a_n (1 - a_n) ] 8. Since ( a_n ) is small for large ( n ), ( 1 - a_n approx 1 ). Therefore: [ n a_{n+1} approx n a_n ] 9. This implies that ( n a_n ) is approximately constant for large ( n ). Let ( n a_n = L ). Then: [ (n+1) a_{n+1} approx L ] 10. Using the recurrence relation again: [ (n+1) a_{n+1} = (n+1) a_n (1 - a_n) ] Substituting ( n a_n = L ), we get: [ L approx (n+1) a_n (1 - a_n) ] 11. For large ( n ), ( n+1 approx n ), so: [ L approx n a_n (1 - a_n) = L (1 - a_n) ] 12. Solving for ( L ), we get: [ L approx L (1 - a_n) ] [ L approx L - L a_n ] [ L a_n approx 1 ] 13. Therefore: [ a_n approx frac{1}{L} ] 14. Since ( n a_n = L ), we have: [ n cdot frac{1}{L} = L ] [ L^2 = n ] 15. Thus: [ L = 1 ] 16. Therefore, we conclude that: [ lim_{n to infty} n a_n = 1 ] (blacksquare) The final answer is ( boxed{ lim_{n to infty} n a_n = 1 } )"},{"prompt":"Given that angle A is an internal angle of triangle ABC, determine whether if cos A = frac{1}{2}, then sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} is a sufficient condition, a necessary condition, both (i.e., a necessary and sufficient condition), or neither.","completion":"Let's analyze the first statement: if cos A = -frac{1}{2}. From this condition and the properties of the cosine function, we deduce that A could be an angle in the second quadrant, with the typical reference angle of 60^circ. Hence, A is 120^circ as A is an angle in a triangle and thus between 0^circ and 180^circ. Now, reviewing the properties of the sine function, we find that sin(120^circ) = sin(180^circ - 60^circ) = sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, if cos A = -frac{1}{2} implies that sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, the first statement is sufficient for the second to be true. Next, we consider the second statement: if sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. If sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, angle A could either be 60^circ or 120^circ because the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants. Consequently, cos A could be cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} or cos(120^circ) = -frac{1}{2}. This demonstrates that sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} does not necessarily imply cos A = -frac{1}{2}, but it could also mean cos A = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the second condition is not necessary for the first. Putting these analyses together, we can conclude that if cos A = -frac{1}{2}, then sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} is a sufficient condition but not a necessary one. boxed{text{The answer is: sufficient but not necessary.}}"},{"prompt":"Let the function f(x)=ax^2+bx+cln x where a, b, c are real constants.

Since 25 is a multiple of itself, we can start by finding the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 249. To do this, we can divide 249 by 25 and round up to the nearest whole number: 249 / 25 = 9.96 Rounding up, we get 10. So the smallest multiple of 25 greater than 249 is 10 * 25 = 250. However, 250 is not an even number, so we need to find the next multiple of 25 that is even. Since 25 is an odd number, every other multiple of it will be even.

Since 500 is an even number, it is the largest even multiple of 25 within the range. Now we need to count how many even multiples of 25 there are between 275 and 500. We can do this by finding the difference between the two multiples and dividing by 50 (since every other multiple of 25 is even, and 25 * 2 = 50): (500 - 275) / 50 = 225 / 50 = 4.5 Since we cannot have a fraction of a multiple, we round down to 4.

Considering the remaining 2n-2 sets (A_4, A_5, ldots, A_{2n+1}), each of these must have exactly one element in common with A_1 due to condition (2).

Since 2n+1 is always odd, n must be even. 6. **Constructing a Valid Labeling Scheme When n is Even:** If n is even, say n = 2k, a valid labeling can be constructed as follows: Arrange the 2n+1 points in a cycle and number them 1, 2, ldots, 2n+1. For pairs (i, j), consider the shorter arc between i and j on this cycle. - If the number of points between i and j (excluding i and j) is odd, label the element with 1. - If this number is even, label the element with 0. 7. **Satisfaction of Conditions:** Because n is even, the number of 0-labeled elements in each A_i is exactly half, ensuring that each A_i contains precisely n elements labeled with 0. # Conclusion: Therefore, the integral values of n that satisfy the problem conditions are the even integers.

According to the problem, if we increase the numerator by 20%, the new numerator becomes ( x + 0.20x = 1.20x ). If we decrease the denominator by 10%, the new denominator becomes ( y - 0.10y = 0.90y ). The new fraction after these changes is ( frac{1.20x}{0.90y} ), and we are told that this equals ( frac{20}{21} ). So we can set up the equation: [ frac{1.20x}{0.90y} = frac{20}{21} ] To solve for ( frac{x}{y} ), we can cross-multiply: [ 1.20x cdot 21 = 20 cdot 0.90y ] [ 25.20x = 18y ] Now we want to find the original fraction ( frac{x}{y} ), so we divide both sides of the equation by ( 18x ): [ frac{25.20x}{18x} = frac{18y}{18x} ] [ frac{25.20}{18} = frac{y}{x} ] [ frac{25.20}{18} = frac{y}{x} ] To simplify ( frac{25.20}{18} ), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

However, since we are looking for the intersection within B, the correct intersection is A cap B = (0, 4) cap (-2, 4) = (0, 4). So, the intersection of sets A and B is boxed{(0,4)}. (2) Since the union of sets B and C equals B (B cup C = B), set C must be a subset of set B (C subseteq B). Given that B=(-2,4) and C=(a, a+1), set C will lie completely within set B if and only if the bounds of C are within the bounds of B. This results in a system of inequalities: [ begin{cases} a geq -2 a+1 leq 4 end{cases} ] Solving this system yields: [ begin{cases} a geq -2 a leq 3 end{cases} ] Therefore, the range of the real number a is boxed{[-2,3]}."},{"prompt":"ar traveling at a certain constant speed takes 2 seconds longer to travel 1 kilometer than it would take to travel 1 kilometer at 80 kilometers per hour . at what speed , in kilometers per hour , is the car traveling ?","completion":"Let's denote the unknown constant speed of the car as ( v ) km/h.

Yolanda walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour. In one hour, she would have walked 3 miles. So, when Bob starts walking, Yolanda is 3 miles away from point X towards point Y. Carlos starts walking 30 minutes after Yolanda, which means he starts walking 30 minutes before Bob. Since Carlos walks at a rate of 5 miles per hour, in 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), he would have walked: 5 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 2.5 miles So, when Bob starts walking, Carlos is 2.5 miles away from point X towards point Y. Now, let's calculate the rate at which the distance between Yolanda and Bob is closing. Yolanda walks at 3 mph and Bob at 4 mph, so together they are closing the distance at a rate of: 3 mph + 4 mph = 7 mph Since they are 24 miles apart when Bob starts walking, it will take them: 24 miles / 7 mph = 3.42857 hours (approximately) to meet.

The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the points. 2. **Types of Convex Hulls**: Since we have five points and no three are collinear, the convex hull cannot be a line segment or a triangle (as we have more than three points). It must therefore be one of the following: - A quadrilateral (four-sided polygon) - A pentagon (five-sided polygon) 3. **Convex Hull as a Quadrilateral or Pentagon**: If the convex hull is a pentagon, it is already clear that any four consecutive vertices of this pentagon form a convex quadrilateral. Hence, the points are arranged in such a manner that the convex quadrilateral is formed immediately among them. So, the proposition is trivial in this case. 4. **Convex Hull as a Triangle (Assumption)**: Assume for contradiction that the convex hull is a triangle, say triangle ABC, and the remaining two points, D and E, lie inside this triangle. 5. **Points Inside the Triangle**: Without loss of generality, let point E lie inside one of the triangles formed by adding D to our convex hull. This creates three sub-cases where E lies within triangles: - triangle ABD - triangle BCD - triangle CAD 6. **Intersection of Lines**: To formalize the argument, let us consider point E to lie inside triangle ABD. Draw the line segment CD that intersects the line AB at point H. Next, consider which sub-triangle point E falls into relative to segments AD and DH.

We need to verify that these vertices form a convex quadrilateral. 8. **Convexity Check**: For these points to form a convex quadrilateral, all internal angles must be less than 180 degrees and the diagonals should intersect inside the quadrilateral. Given that E is inside the triangle, and the shape follows the definition of a convex quadrilateral based on the above formation, thus AEDC is convex. 9. **Conclusion**: Whether the convex hull is a quadrilateral or a pentagon or by internal constructive method when it is perceived to be a triangle, it remains clear to verify that four out of five points form vertices of a convex quadrilateral.

We go back to the initial terms and apply the rule consistent with a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n+2}: - b_1 = 1, - b_2 = -2, - b_3 = b_1 - b_2 = 1 - (-2) = 3, - Now, since b_{n+1} = b_n + b_{n+2}, we have b_3 = b_1 + b_4, which gives us b_4 = b_3 - b_1 = 3 - 1 = 2, - Next, b_4 = b_2 + b_5, which gives us b_5 = b_4 - b_2 = 2 - (-2) = 4, - Similarly, b_5 = b_3 + b_6, so b_6 = b_5 - b_3 = 4 - 3 = 1, - Continuing on, b_6 = b_4 + b_7, so b_7 = b_6 - b_4 = 1 - 2 = -1, - And so on... Now, we notice that the sequence indeed repeats every six terms: - b_1 = 1, - b_2 = -2, - b_3 = 3, - b_4 = 2, (correcting the previous assumption) - b_5 = -2, (similarly, correcting the pattern) - b_6 = -1, (establishing the cycle) The pattern is now clear: - b_7 = b_1 = 1, - b_8 = b_2 = -2, - b_9 = b_3 = 3, - b_{10} = b_4 = 2, - b_{11} = b_5 = -2, - b_{12} = b_6 = -1, - And so on... Thus, the sequence {b_n} is a periodic sequence with a period of 6. The sum of any complete cycle of 6 terms is b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 + b_6 = 1 - 2 + 3 + 2 - 2 - 1 = 1, and the sum of the first 2014 terms can be found by taking the sum of the first (2014 mod 6) = 4 terms of the sequence: - S_{2014} = (text{number of complete cycles}) cdot (1) + (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4) - There are lfloor frac{2014}{6} rfloor = 335 complete cycles, and 335 cdot 1 = 335, - The sum of the first 4 terms is 1 - 2 + 3 + 2 = 4, So, the sum S_{2014} is equal to the sum of complete cycles plus the partial cycle: S_{2014} = 335 + 4 = 339 Therefore, the sum of the first 2014 terms of the sequence {b_n} is boxed{339}."},{"prompt":"Given that ( a ) and ( b ) are nonzero vectors satisfying ( (a 2b) perp a ) and ( (b 2a) perp b ), what is the angle between ( a ) and ( b )?

Smallest Prime Squares First, we identify the smallest prime squares: [ 4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529, 841, 961, 1369, 1681, 1849, 2209. ] Since ( 2209 > 2010 ), we immediately conclude that ( k leq 14 ). Odd Primes and Modulo Considerations Next, notice that for any odd prime ( p ), ( p^{2} equiv 1 pmod{8} ). So, let us examine the equation: [ p_{1}^{2} + p_{2}^{2} + cdots + p_{k}^{2} equiv 2010 pmod{8}. ] We know that ( 2010 equiv 2 pmod{8} ). If all ( p_i ) are odd primes, then: [ k cdot 1 equiv 2 pmod{8}, ] which implies: [ k equiv 2 pmod{8}. ] Now we test the possible values for ( k ): Case ( k = 2 ) [ 2 cdot 1 = 2 ] This seems plausible, but since ( 2010 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) and knowing that for any prime ( p ), ( p^2 equiv 0 ) or ( 1 pmod{3} ), it would require: [ p_{1}^{2} + p_{2}^{2} equiv 0 pmod{3}, ] which requires both ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) to be ( equiv 0 pmod{3} ). However, there is no pair of distinct prime numbers such that both are divisible by 3, hence ( k = 2 ) is impossible. Case ( k = 10 ) Evaluating whether the sum of the squares of the first ten odd primes exceeds 2010: [ 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 + 13^2 + 17^2 + 19^2 + 23^2 + 29^2 + 31^2 = 9 + 25 + 49 + 121 + 169 + 289 + 361 + 529 + 841 + 961 = 3354 > 2010 ] Clearly, ( k = 10 ) is impossible as the sum exceeds 2010. Including the Prime 2 Assuming one of the primes is 2 (i.e., ( 2^2 = 4 )), we reevaluate modulo 8: [ 4 + (k-1) cdot 1 equiv 2 pmod{8}, ] which simplifies to: [ k - 1 equiv -2 pmod{8}, ] [ k - 1 equiv 6 pmod{8}, ] thus: [ k equiv 7 pmod{8}. ] Since ( k leq 14 ), the only possible value is ( k = 7 ).

Observe the symmetry and behavior of the polynomial expression in terms of divisibility when expanding the sum of odd powers. 2. **Sum of Odd Powers**: - The sum of odd powers of the differences (x-y), (y-z), and (z-x) can be factorized through examination of coefficients corresponding to the individual terms. - Specifically, we analyze (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 and find common factors systematically. 3. **Using Symmetry**: - Define f(x,y,z) = (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5. - Because of the symmetry of f, each cyclic permutation should also represent a valid statement of the polynomial, ensuring that there would be common factors amongst them. 4. **Divisibility by (z-x)**: - First check if this sum is divisible by (z-x). - Since (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 can be cyclically rotated, to ensure divisibility by (z-x), re-arranging the terms and factoring out (z-x) from the resulting expressions confirms divisibility (by symmetry and polynomial properties). 5. **Divisibility by (y-z) and (x-y)**: - Similarly, by symmetric argument and factorization, it can be shown that (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 is divisible by (y-z) and (x-y). 6. **Combining Factors**: - Since (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 is divisible by (x-y), (y-z), and (z-x), it must be divisible by their product (x-y)(y-z)(z-x). 7. **Coefficient Divisibility**: - Upon further detailed expansion (a+b+c=0), represent (x-y)=a, (y-z)=b, and (z-x)=c so c=-(a+b). - Substituting above, the detailed expansion becomes: (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 = a^5 + b^5 + (-(a+b))^5. - Using the binomial theorem for expansion, we get: (-(a+b))^5 = -(a+b)^5 = -sum_{k=0}^5 binom{5}{k} a^k b^{5-k}, which is arranged by noting that (a + b + c = 0) ensures that final terms of a+b+c lead to zero modulo combination properties. 8. **Final Step and Simplifying**: - Simplifying and collecting terms ensuring coefficients ensure divisibility, leading to: (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 = -5ab(a+b)(a^2 + ab + b^2), 9. **Factoring 5**: - The above polynomial did not just factor but contained a contributing factor of -5, confirming 5 part divisibility aspect. 10. **Final Combination**: (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 = 5 times (x-y)(y-z)(z-x)Q(x,y,z) text{ where } Q(x,y,z) text{ is a function arising from above expansion terms.} Since we have established it is divisible by (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) and factor of 5, we conclude with: (x-y)^5 + (y-z)^5 + (z-x)^5 text{ is divisible by } 5(x-y)(y-z)(z-x).

After the second night, the number of ducks remaining is: 240 - F * 240 = 240 * (1 - F) On the third night, 30 percent (which is the same as 0.3) of the remaining ducks are stolen.

He is allowed to fold up two bars at an endpoint or to cut a bar into two equal pieces, but two bars may not overlap or intersect. What is the minimum number of pieces he must use?","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of metal pieces required to construct an ( n times n ) unit net using metal bars of length 2. The key is to decompose the net into L-shaped pieces. 1. **Calculate the total length of metal required:** An ( n times n ) unit net consists of ( n+1 ) horizontal lines and ( n+1 ) vertical lines, each of length ( n ). Therefore, the total length of metal required is: [ 2n(n+1) ] This is because there are ( n+1 ) horizontal lines and ( n+1 ) vertical lines, each of length ( n ), so the total length is: [ (n+1)n + (n+1)n = 2n(n+1) ] 2. **Decompose the net into L-shaped pieces:** Each L-shaped piece consists of two segments of length 1, forming a right angle. Each L-shaped piece can be considered as using 2 units of metal length. 3. **Determine the number of L-shaped pieces:** Since each L-shaped piece uses 2 units of metal length, the number of L-shaped pieces required to cover the total length ( 2n(n+1) ) is: [ frac{2n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1) ] 4. **Verify the construction:** To ensure that the construction is valid, we need to check that the L-shaped pieces can be arranged without overlapping or intersecting. This can be done by visualizing the net and placing the L-shaped pieces accordingly. For example, for ( n=3 ), the net can be decomposed into L-shaped pieces as shown in the problem statement. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces required to construct the ( n times n ) unit net is ( n(n+1) ).

Show that its perimeter is even.","completion":"1. **Coloring the points:** - We start by coloring each point ((x, y)) in (mathbb{Z}^2) using two colors, say blue and red, according to the parity of (x + y). Specifically, we color the point ((x, y)) blue if (x + y) is even, and red if (x + y) is odd. 2. **Analyzing the segment:** - Consider any side ([AB]) of the pentagon with (A=(x_A, y_A)) and (B=(x_B, y_B)). - The length (l) of this segment can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem: [ l = sqrt{(x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2} ] - To determine the parity of the length (l), consider (l^2): [ l^2 = (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 ] - Modulo 2, this becomes: [ l^2 equiv (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 pmod{2} ] - Since ((x_A - x_B)^2 equiv (x_A - x_B) pmod{2}) and ((y_A - y_B)^2 equiv (y_A - y_B) pmod{2}), we have: [ l^2 equiv (x_A - x_B) + (y_A - y_B) pmod{2} ] - Thus, [ l equiv (x_A - x_B) + (y_A - y_B) pmod{2} ] 3. **Parity of (l):** - Now, observe that if (A) and (B) are of the same color, then ( (x_A + y_A) equiv (x_B + y_B) pmod{2} ), which implies: [ (x_A - x_B) + (y_A - y_B) equiv 0 pmod{2} ] hence (l) is even. - Conversely, if (A) and (B) are of different colors, then ( (x_A + y_A) notequiv (x_B + y_B) pmod{2} ), which implies: [ (x_A - x_B) + (y_A - y_B) equiv 1 pmod{2} ] hence (l) is odd. 4. **Pentagon traversal:** - When we traverse the pentagon, starting from any vertex and returning to it, we will visit every vertex of the pentagon. Since the pentagon has an odd number of sides, and each side length is odd, we must carefully count the occurrence of color transitions. - Initially, if we start at a vertex (V_1), and since there are an odd number of sides (5 in the case of a pentagon), the total number of transitions between different colored vertices is odd. - However, to return to the starting vertex of the same color we necessarily encounter each transition an even number of times. Therefore, the sum of such odd lengths (transitions between different colored vertices) must be such that the overall perimeter accumulates to an even value. 5. **Conclusion:** - Regardless of the starting point, each side length being odd implies that we have an even number of transition combinations within all segments placed, ultimately leading us to conclude that the overall perimeter of the pentagon is even.

This means that the joint probability of both events A and B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: P(A cap B) = P(A) cdot P(B) = frac{1}{6} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{12} The probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred can be found by using the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(B)} Substitute the values we found for P(A cap B) and P(B): P(A|B) = frac{frac{1}{12}}{frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{12} cdot frac{2}{1} = frac{1}{6} Therefore, the answer is: boxed{frac{1}{6}}"},{"prompt":"Alice and Bob were dining at the same restaurant.

The actual weight he is selling is 960 grams, but he is charging for 1000 grams. So, the gain for every 960 grams sold is (1000 - 960) = 40 grams.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, and 20 is 60. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60: Combined rate = (6/60) + (4/60) + (3/60) Combined rate = (6 + 4 + 3) / 60 Combined rate = 13/60 This means that together, x, y, and z can complete 13/60 of the work in one day.

Since the batsman's average increased by 3 after scoring 66 runs in the 17th inning, we can set up the following equation: (A * 16 + 66) / 17 = A + 3 Solving for A, we get: 16A + 66 = 17A + 51 66 - 51 = 17A - 16A 15 = A So, the batsman's average before the 17th inning was 15, and after the 17th inning, it became 15 + 3 = 18.

Substituting a_{1}=d into these expressions, we get: [ 3d + 3d + left(frac{2}{d} + frac{6}{2d} + frac{12}{3d}right) = 21 ] Simplifying, we find: [ 6d + frac{9}{d} = 21 ] Rearranging and solving for d, we get: [ 2d^2 - 7d + 3 = 0 ] Since d > 1, solving this quadratic equation gives us d = 3. 3. **General Formula**: - With a_{1} = d = 3, the general formula for {a_{n}} is: [ a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d = 3 + 3(n-1) = 3n ] - Therefore, the general formula for {a_{n}} is boxed{a_{n} = 3n}. Part 2: Given that {b_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence and S_{99}-T_{99}=99, we analyze the conditions for both assumptions about {a_{n}}. 1. **For a_{n} = tn**: - We have b_{n} = frac{n+1}{t}, and d = t > 1. - Calculating S_{99}-T_{99}, we get: [ frac{(t + 99t) times 99}{2} - left(frac{2}{t} + frac{100}{t}right) times frac{99}{2} = 99 ] Simplifying, we find: [ 50t - frac{51}{t} = 1 ] Solving this equation gives d = t = frac{51}{50}. 2. **For a_{n} = k(n+1)**: - We have b_{n} = frac{n}{k}, and d = k > 1. - Calculating S_{99}-T_{99}, we get: [ frac{(2k + 100k) times 99}{2} - left(frac{1}{k} + frac{99}{k}right) times frac{99}{2} = 99 ] Simplifying, we find: [ 51k - frac{50}{k} = 1 ] Solving the equation 51k^2 - k - 50 = 0 does not yield a solution for d = k > 1.

Step 2: Compute GCD and LCM using prime factorizations The GCD and LCM of any two or three numbers can be computed as follows: - (a, b, c) = prod p_i^{min(a_i, b_i, c_i)} - [a, b, c] = prod p_i^{max(a_i, b_i, c_i)} - (a, b) = prod p_i^{min(a_i, b_i)}, and similarly for (b, c) and (c, a) - [a, b] = prod p_i^{max(a_i, b_i)}, and similarly for [b, c] and [c, a] Step 3: Substitute into the identity and simplify Substitute the expressions from Step 2 into the identity: [ frac{left(prod p_i^{max(a_i, b_i, c_i)}right)^2}{prod p_i^{max(a_i, b_i)} prod p_i^{max(b_i, c_i)} prod p_i^{max(c_i, a_i)}} = frac{left(prod p_i^{min(a_i, b_i, c_i)}right)^2}{prod p_i^{min(a_i, b_i)} prod p_i^{min(b_i, c_i)} prod p_i^{min(c_i, a_i)}} ] Both sides simplify to: [ prod p_i^{2max(a_i, b_i, c_i) - max(a_i, b_i) - max(b_i, c_i) - max(c_i, a_i)} = prod p_i^{2min(a_i, b_i, c_i) - min(a_i, b_i) - min(b_i, c_i) - min(c_i, a_i)} ] Step 4: Verify the equality of exponents For each prime p_i, we need to show: [ 2max(a_i, b_i, c_i) - max(a_i, b_i) - max(b_i, c_i) - max(c_i, a_i) = 2min(a_i, b_i, c_i) - min(a_i, b_i) - min(b_i, c_i) - min(c_i, a_i) ] This equality holds by the properties of max and min functions over the integers, as shown in the detailed solutions provided. Each term on the left corresponds to a similar term on the right, considering the maximum and minimum values among a_i, b_i, c_i.

Prove that a circle can be inscribed in such a quadrilateral.","completion":"The problem states that the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect its angles, and we need to prove that a circle can be inscribed in such a quadrilateral. Let's proceed step-by-step to understand this geometric property. 1. **Conditions for inscribing a circle in a quadrilateral:** According to the given problem, the diagonals of the quadrilateral bisect its angles. Let's denote the quadrilateral as (ABCD) with diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersecting at point (O). Since the diagonals bisect the angles, we have: [ angle BAO = angle DAO, quad angle ABO = angle DBO ] and similarly for the other vertices. 2. **Identify equal segments formed by diagonals:** Due to the angle bisectors, each vertex is connected to the point (O) such that the relative segments formed are equal: [ AO = AO, quad BO = BO, quad CO = CO, quad DO = DO ] 3. **Use the angle bisector theorem to prove the circle can be inscribed:** The angle bisector theorem tells us that the point of intersection of the angle bisectors (which is also where the diagonals intersect) is equidistant from all sides of the quadrilateral. This means that: [ overline{OM} = overline{ON} = overline{OP} = overline{OQ} ] where (M, N, P,) and (Q) are the points where the perpendiculars from (O) meet the sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) respectively. 4. **Conclusion by verifying the possibility of drawing an incircle:** Since point (O) is equidistant from all the sides of the quadrilateral, this indicates that we can draw a circle centered at (O) with radius equal to the perpendicular distance from (O) to any side of the quadrilateral. This circle will touch all four sides of the quadrilateral, making it an incircle. Thus, we have proven that if the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect its angles, then a circle can be inscribed in the quadrilateral.

Therefore, there are no restrictions on x from the numerator. 2. **Denominator Analysis**: sqrt{2-x}: For the square root to be defined, the expression inside must be greater than or equal to 0.

Consider any polyhedron W and let mu be one of its faces. The smallest polygonal face a polyhedron can have is a triangle. 2. Since mu has at least three sides, it follows that mu must be bounded by at least three edges. 3. A polyhedron is not degenerate, meaning it cannot be flattened into a single plane. Therefore, there must exist vertices outside the plane of mu. 4. Let A be such a vertex not lying in the plane of mu. We observe that at least three edges must meet at A. 5. These three edges must be distinct from the edges of face mu. 6. Therefore, our polyhedron W has at least six edges: three edges belonging to mu and three edges connecting the vertex A to the vertices of mu. 7. Hence, a polyhedron must have at least six edges. Conclusion: The polyhedron with the minimum number of edges is the tetrahedron, which has exactly six edges. Any polyhedron must have at least six edges. ( blacksquare ) Part (b) 1. To show there is no polyhedron with exactly seven edges: - Suppose a polyhedron exists with seven edges. - Each face of the polyhedron must be a triangle, because if any face were a polygon with more than three sides, the number of edges would be at least three times the number of vertices, and thus exceed seven. 2. Furthermore, we denote by N the total number of edges counted in all faces of W. Since each face is a triangle, each edge is counted twice, N is twice the number of edges in W: [ N = 2E = 2 times 7 = 14 ] 3. Let each vertex of the polyhedron have at least three edges meeting. Since we have an odd number (7) of edges: - A contradiction arises because the sum of degrees of vertices must be equal to 2E = 14, which is even. 4. Additionally, counting the total number of vertex incidences (sum of face sides), all faces being triangles indicates N must be multiple of 3, which contradicts N=14 as it is not a multiple of 3.

Two intuitive methods come to mind: 1. **Considering whether the expression can be factored**: This approach requires finding an appropriate n that allows the expression to be factored based on k. However, such an n often needs to depend on k in an intricate way, which contradicts the requirement that n is a constant. For instance, assuming n = 2^{3k+1} is not acceptable as n must be fixed for all k. So, we shift our focus to the second method. 2. **Proving the form is always divisible by some prime number**: This method seems more promising, as we only need to interpret 2^k modulo some prime and check the congruences. # Step-by-Step Solution Step 1: Understanding the Modulo Classes Let's determine 2^k mod p for various primes p. We aim to ensure that k cycles through all integers can be classified into congruence classes such that n cdot 2^{k} + 1 equiv 0 mod p or n cdot 2^{k} + 1 is always composite. Step 2: Using Chinese Remainder Theorem We aim to find several primes and their respective congruence classes so that these classes cover all positive integers k. This concept is known as \\"complete residue coverage.\\" Step 3: Selecting a Set of Primes and Congruences We choose primes such that 2^k mod p covers all possibilities for distinct p: begin{aligned} k &equiv 1 pmod{2}, k &equiv 1 pmod{3}, k &equiv 2 pmod{4}, k &equiv 4 pmod{8}, k &equiv 0 pmod{12}, k &equiv 8 pmod{24}. end{aligned} Step 4: Verification of Coverage Verify that for any selected prime p_i, 2^k mod p_i produces only one residue for the given k satisfying the above congruences. This can be practically checked for each set of congruences. Step 5: Consistency Check for Composite Numbers Using one of the relations as an example: - If k fits: k equiv 1 pmod{2}, quad k equiv 1 pmod{3}, then, n cdot 2^k + 1 equiv 2k + 1 equiv 3 pmod{3} equiv 0 pmod{3} - Similar checks can be done for the other congruences. Due to minimal changes in residue classes and considering large primes, we imply that there will be a consistent choice where n cdot 2^{k} + 1 for any k is always composite. # Conclusion By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, such k exists for selected congruences, ensuring that n cdot 2^{k} + 1 is always composite for any integer k: blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that a and b are constants, and the sum of the three monomials 4xy^{2}, axy^{b}, 5xy is still a monomial.

For two terms to be like terms, their variables and their corresponding exponents must be the same. Therefore, for axy^{b} and -5xy to be like terms, we must have b=1. This implies: [b = 1] Given that the sum of these terms is a monomial, and knowing that axy^{b} and -5xy are like terms, we can equate their coefficients to find the value of a. Thus, we have: [a = 5] Combining the values of a and b, we get: [a + b = 5 + 1 = 6] **Case 2:** 4xy^{2} and axy^{b} are like terms. Similarly, for 4xy^{2} and axy^{b} to be like terms, their variables and exponents must match, which means b=2. This gives us: [b = 2] Since the sum of the monomials is a monomial, and given that 4xy^{2} and axy^{b} are like terms, for their sum to be a monomial, it implies that their coefficients must sum to zero. Therefore: [a + 4 = 0] [a = -4] Combining the values of a and b in this case, we find: [a + b = -4 + 2 = -2] Therefore, the possible values of a+b are -2 or 6.

Similarly, the area of triangle (Delta ACD) is denoted as (S_{Delta mathrm{ACD}}). 5. Since diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at point (M), the point (M) divides the area of each of these triangles into two parts: * The area of (Delta mathrm{AMD}) is shared between (Delta mathrm{ABD}) and (Delta mathrm{ACD}). * Thus, the area of (Delta CMD), which is part of (Delta mathrm{ACD}), is given by: [ S_{Delta mathrm{CMD}} = S_{Delta mathrm{ACD}} - S_{Delta mathrm{AMD}} ] * Similarly, the area of (Delta AMB), a part of (Delta mathrm{ABD}), is given by: [ S_{Delta mathrm{AMB}} = S_{Delta mathrm{ABD}} - S_{Delta mathrm{AMD}} ] 6.

The length of the median on side AB is ______.","completion":"To solve for the length of the median on side AB in acute triangle ABC with given conditions, we proceed as follows: 1. Given frac{1}{tan A} + frac{1}{tan B} = frac{4}{tan C}, we can rewrite this using the definition of tangent as frac{cos A}{sin A} + frac{cos B}{sin B} = frac{4cos C}{sin C}. 2. Applying the Sine Law and Cosine Law, we transform the equation into frac{{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}-{a}^{2}}{2abc} + frac{{a}^{2}+{c}^{2}-{b}^{2}}{2abc} = frac{4({a}^{2}+{b}^{2}-{c}^{2})}{2abc}. 3. Simplifying the above equation, we find that a^{2} + b^{2} = frac{3}{2}c^{2}. 4. Using the Cosine Law again, we have c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2abcos C, which simplifies to 2abcos C = a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2} = frac{1}{2}c^{2}. 5. Let CD be the median on side AB. We can express overrightarrow{CD} as frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{CB} + overrightarrow{CA}). 6.

Consider a quadrilateral (ABCD) which is not a trapezoid. If it were a trapezoid, slight modifications to the solution might be required. 2. Given that quadrilateral (ABCD) is a circumscribed quadrilateral, according to Newton's theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals, the incenter (I) of the circle lies on the segment (MN), where (M) and (N) are the midpoints of diagonals (AC) and (BD) respectively. 3. Let (lambda = frac{MI}{IN}). Choose points (P, Q, R,) and (S) on the sides of the quadrilateral such that the ratios (AP: PB = CQ: QB = CR: RD = DS: SA = lambda). 4. We must show that (I) is the midpoint of segments (PR) and (QS). 5. To do this, assign unit masses to points (A) and (C), and masses of (lambda) to points (B) and (D). The two unit masses can be considered equivalent to a mass of 2 located at (M) (the midpoint of (AC)), and the two masses (lambda) can be replaced by a mass (2lambda) at (N) (the midpoint of (BD)). 6. Since (I) is the centroid of all four masses, we can similarly conclude that if we replace the masses at (A) and (C) with a mass (1 + lambda) at (P), and at (B) and (D) with a mass (1 + lambda) at (R), then (I) will be the midpoint of the segment (PR). 7. As the point (I) acts as a midpoint for both segments (PR) and (QS), we infer that these segments are parallel to the angle bisector of one of the angles formed by lines (AB) and (CD). 8. Similarly, segment (QS) must be parallel to the angle bisector of an angle between lines (AD) and (BC). Consequently, quadrilateral (ABCD) is inscribed if and only if (PR perp QS). 9. Given that (PQRS) forms a parallelogram (with sides parallel to (AC) and (BD)), (PQRS) must actually be a rhombus, implying (PQ = QR). 10.

The general equation for such an ellipse is: frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 where (h,k) is the center of the ellipse, a is the semi-major axis length, and b is the semi-minor axis length.

Consider the polynomial: [ f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 ] It is easy to see that the squares and cubes of this polynomial: [ (f(x))^2 ] and [ (f(x))^3 ] contain only positive coefficients. However, f(x) itself is not strictly positive as the coefficient of x^2 is zero. 3. Since we need a polynomial with at least one negative coefficient, let's slightly modify f(x).

The coefficients of the polynomials (g(x))^2 and (g(x))^3 will be very close to the coefficients of (f(x))^2 and (f(x))^3, respectively.

Under normal circumstances, the uric acid in the human body is in a balanced state. However, if the body produces too much uric acid that cannot be excreted in time or if the uric acid excretion mechanism degrades, excessive uric acid will accumulate in the body. When the blood uric acid concentration is greater than 7mg/dL, the body fluids become acidic. Prolonged acidity can lead to gout. Lowpurine foods have a good therapeutic effect on increasing the relief rate of gout patients and reducing blood uric acid concentration. During the research on a certain type of lowpurine food, researchers found that under specific conditions such as daily timing and quantity, the change in blood uric acid concentration U(t) (unit: mg/dL) with the number of days t of intake of lowpurine food can be described by the logarithmic model U(t)=U_{0}ln Kt, where U_{0} is the initial blood uric acid concentration and K is a parameter.

The key piece of information provided is that the circular spot of light observed on the screen has the same diameter when the screen is moved closer, indicating that the beam remains focused in the same way. 1. **Initial Configuration:** - A parallel beam of light falls normally on a thin lens. - The initial position of the screen is 80 , text{cm} from the lens. 2. **Changed Configuration:** - The screen is moved 40 , text{cm} towards the lens, resulting in a new position of 80 , text{cm} - 40 , text{cm} = 40 , text{cm} from the lens. - The spot on the screen does not change in diameter, implying that the image formed by the lens has not changed in size, which corresponds to focused light. 3. **Lens Formula:** - The lens formula, given by [frac{1}{f} = frac{1}{v} + frac{1}{u},] where (f) represents the focal length of the lens, (v) is the image distance, and (u) is the object distance. - Since the parallel beam's object distance (u) is considered infinite, the lens formula simplifies to (v = f). 4. **Focus Explanation:** - For the image spot diameter to remain constant when moving the screen 40 cm, the difference in positions suggests two possible focal distances: one for the lens to focus at 40 cm and another to focus at 80 cm. - By reversing the earlier point: if we move the screen closer by 40 cm from 80 cm to 40 cm and still form the same diameter of the light spot, implies the light converges properly at these distances. 5. **Possible Focal Lengths:** - If focusing is stable at both given distances: [ F_{1} = 80 + 20 = 100 , text{cm} ] The above calculation is achieved by equating initial distances, adding an intermediate focus distance for proper convergence.

To find the probability that exactly two people hit the target, we consider three scenarios: A and B hit the target, A and C hit the target, and B and C hit the target. - The probability that A and B hit the target, but C misses, is 0.7 times 0.6 times (1 - 0.5) = 0.21. - The probability that A and C hit the target, but B misses, is 0.7 times (1 - 0.6) times 0.5 = 0.14. - The probability that B and C hit the target, but A misses, is (1 - 0.7) times 0.6 times 0.5 = 0.09.

We need to find ( x ). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identification of Basic Properties:** Since the number ( x = 9^n - 1 ) is given and 9 raised to any power is an even number, one of the prime divisors of ( x ) must be 2 because ( x ) is one less than an even number (hence ( x ) is odd). 2. **Factorization of ( x = 9^n - 1 ):** Consider the prime factorization of ( x ): [ x = 9^n - 1 = (3^2)^n - 1 = (3^n)^2 - 1^2 = (3^n - 1)(3^n + 1) ] 3. **Divisibility by 13:** Since ( x ) has three distinct prime factors, and one of them is 13, we need to ensure that either ( 3^n - 1 ) or ( 3^n + 1 ) is divisible by 13. This is achieved if ( n ) is a multiple of 3 because ( 3^3 equiv 1 pmod{13} ). Hence, ( n ) must be equal to ( 3m ). 4. **Rewriting ( x ):** Thus, let ( n = 3m ): [ x = 9^{3m} - 1 = (9^m)^3 - 1 ] Using the factorization of a difference of cubes: [ x = (9^m - 1)(9^{2m} + 9^m + 1) ] 5. **Mutual Primality Analysis:** By realizing that ( p = 9^m - 1 ) and ( q = 9^{2m} + 9^m + 1 ) are mutually prime, if a common divisor ( r ) exists, it must divide: [ q - (9^m + 2)(p) = q - (9^m + 2)(9^m - 1) = q - 9^{2m} - 2 cdot 9^m + 2 = 3 ] But ( p ) is not divisible by 3, so the only common divisor is 1. 6. **Analyzing ( p = 9^m - 1 ) and ( q = 9^{2m} + 9^m + 1 ):** Prove that ( p = 9^m - 1 ) is a power of two only when ( m = 1 ): If ( p ) would be a power of two for ( m > 1 ): [ p = (3^m - 1)(3^m + 1) ] For ( p ) to be a power of two, it must be ( 4, 8, 16, ldots), but no adjacent even numbers multiplied give a power of two greater than 4. 7. **Verification for ( m = 1 ):** Let ( m = 1 ): [ x = 9^{3 cdot 1} - 1 = 9^3 - 1 = 729 - 1 = 728 = 2^3 cdot 7 cdot 13 ] This matches all conditions: being divisible by 13, having three distinct prime numbers. 8. **Uniqueness Check for ( m > 1 ):** For ( m > 1 ), the terms ( p ) and ( q ) will either conflict with mutual primality or include more than two non-pairwise prime factors into finding simplicity constraints across larger values. **Conclusion:** The only suitable value for ( x ) that fits all conditions given is: [ boxed{728} ]"},{"prompt":"Javier exercised for 50 minutes every day for a certain period.

Plane partitions can be represented as matrices where the entries are non-increasing both across rows and columns. Consider a grid of integers where each cell contains an integer value. This setup lays the groundwork for associating the values in the grid to the corresponding entries in the plane partition. 2. **Constructing the Plane Partition:** From a given integer grid, the plane partition is constructed as follows: - The lowest values (or the 'bottom sides') are considered to be empty partitions. - Knowing the values around a particular cell allows us to determine the value at the top of the grid for that cell. An example of this process can be visualized in the image referenced: ![Example Grid to Plane Partition](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_da6e2ad19b1b4e3d33dcg-251.jpg?height=212&width=198&top_left_y=542&top_left_x=974) 3. **Reading the Plane Partition:** The plane partition is read off from the top of the grid. The uppermost part of the grid corresponds to lambda_{0}, the right next to it corresponds to lambda_1, and so forth. Similarly, the left adjacent parts correspond to lambda_{-1}, lambda_{-2}, etc. Elements lambda_i not featuring in the grid are considered empty. 4. **Calculating the Size of a Partition:** Utilizing the formula for the size of lambda', the size of a plane partition corresponding to an intersection is the sum of the integers contained within the largest rectangle formed with that intersection and the uppermost vertex. 5. **Summation of Values:** To determine the total size of the plane partition, sum the integers in the grid, counting an integer k times if it falls within the k-th highest horizontal diagonal. - Example Calculation: For the grid provided, the size calculation would be: [ 3 cdot 2 + 4 cdot 5 = 6 + 20 = 26 ] The given plane partition for this example is: [ left(begin{array}{lll} 5 & 5 & 5 5 & 2 & 2 & 2 & end{array}right) ] 6. **Series Generating Function for Plane Partitions:** Given the size formula, we can associate to each grid cell a generating series, whose product over all cells yields the generating series for plane partitions. # Conclusion: The solution outlines a detailed method for associating integer grids to plane partitions, including a concrete example and the necessary calculations.

The total number of students across all three grades in the high school section is ______.","completion":"Since a stratified sampling method is used to draw a sample of 180 students, where 70 are drawn from Grade 1 and 60 from Grade 2, the number of students drawn from Grade 3 can be determined as follows: 180 - 70 - 60 = 50. Knowing that there are 1000 students in Grade 3, we can calculate the probability of an individual student being chosen in the sample: frac{50}{1000} = frac{1}{20}. With the stratified sampling method, the total student population across all grades can be estimated by using the sample size and the probability of an individual being selected: 180 div frac{1}{20} = 3600. Therefore, the total number of students in the high school is (boxed{3600}). To contextualize, in the sampling process, each individual has the same probability of being selected. This is the basis for solving some sampling problems. The relationship between the sample size, the total population, and the probability of an individual being selected allows us to determine one value if we have knowledge of the other two."},{"prompt":"Samuel swept the porch and cleared ninetenths of the dust particles from it. As he walked across the porch afterward, his shoes left some dust particles behind. There were 331 dust particles on the porch after he walked across it, and there were 1080 dust particles before Samuel swept. How many dust particles did his shoes leave behind?","completion":"Before Samuel swept, there were 1080 dust particles on the porch. After he swept, he cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, which means he left one-tenth of the dust particles on the porch. To find out how many dust particles were left after he swept, we calculate one-tenth of 1080: 1/10 * 1080 = 108 dust particles. After Samuel walked across the porch, there were 331 dust particles. To find out how many dust particles his shoes left behind, we subtract the number of dust particles left after he swept from the number of dust particles on the porch after he walked across it: 331 (after walking) - 108 (after sweeping) = 223 dust particles.

Take out the trash: 1/6 of the time it takes to do homework, so 30 minutes / 6 = 5 minutes Now, let's add up the time for the tasks we know: Homework + Clean room + Take out the trash = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 5 minutes = 50 minutes Janice has 35 minutes left before the movie starts, and she needs to finish all tasks in 2 hours (120 minutes). So, the time she has already spent on tasks is: 120 minutes - 35 minutes = 85 minutes The time spent on walking the dog is the difference between the time already spent (85 minutes) and the time spent on the other tasks (50 minutes): 85 minutes - 50 minutes = 35 minutes So, Janice spends 35 minutes walking the dog. To find out how many more minutes it takes Janice to walk the dog than to do her homework, we subtract the time spent on homework from the time spent on walking the dog: 35 minutes (walk the dog) - 30 minutes (homework) = 5 minutes Janice takes boxed{5} more minutes to walk the dog than to do her homework."},{"prompt":"he maximum number of student amoung them 1001 pens and 910 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is","completion":"To find the maximum number of students among whom 1001 pens and 910 pencils can be distributed equally, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 1001 and 910.

Let us start by analyzing the possible numbers for team members under the given constraints. 1. **Selecting Odd Numbers**: - Consider selecting all odd numbers from the set {1, 2, ..., 100}. - The set of odd numbers in this range is {1, 3, 5, ..., 99}. - There are 50 odd numbers in this range. These 50 odd numbers can potentially be the team members' numbers, because: a. **Sum of Two Odd Numbers**: - The sum of two odd numbers is an even number. - Since all chosen members have odd numbers, their sum will never result in a sum that matches any other chosen member's number. b. **Twice Any Odd Number**: - Twice any odd number results in an even number. - As all selected numbers are odd, twice any selected (odd) number will not be in the set of selected numbers. 2. **Proof - No More Than 50 Members**: - Suppose there are 51 team members with numbers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{50}, a_{51}). - Sort these numbers in increasing order: (a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{50} < a_{51}). 3. **Non-repetition Criterion Analysis**: - Consider the differences (a_{51} - a_1, a_{51} - a_2, cdots, a_{51} - a_{50}), giving us 50 differences. - Adding these original 51 numbers and the differences, we have a total of (51 + 50 = 101) distinct numbers to account for. - All these numbers fall within the interval (1 text{ to } 100). 4. **Pigeonhole Principle**: - Given the 101 distinct results and only 100 numbers in the range 1 to 100, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these results must be the same. - Since the original 51 numbers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{50}, a_{51}) are distinct, the equality must come from (a_i = a_{51} - a_j) for some (i neq j), implying (a_i + a_j = a_{51}). - If (i = j), then we would have (a_{51} = 2a_i), which violates our list of conditions.

Solving for x yields: 2^x > 1 This inequality is true for all x > 0, as any positive exponent of 2 results in a number greater than 1.

A positive integer ( m ) is a triangular number if and only if it can be expressed in the form: [ T_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] where ( n ) is a positive integer. 1. **Understanding the Difference Between Consecutive Triangular Numbers**: The difference between the ( n )-th and ( (n+1) )-st triangular numbers can be computed as: [ T_{n+1} - T_n = frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Simplifying this, we find: [ T_{n+1} - T_n = frac{(n^2 + 3n + 2 - n^2 - n)}{2} = frac{2n + 2}{2} = n + 1 ] Thus, the difference between consecutive triangular numbers is ( n + 1 ). 2. **Characterizing Non-Triangular Numbers**: A positive integer ( m ) is not a triangular number if and only if it can be represented in the form: [ m = frac{n^2 + n}{2} + y ] where ( 1 leq y leq n ). 3. **Expressing the Condition in Terms of ( x ) and ( y )**: Let's define ( x = n - y + 1 ). The conditions ( 1 leq y leq n ) imply that ( x geq 1 ) since: [ y geq 1 implies n + 1 geq y implies x = n - y + 1 geq 1. ] Similarly, ( y leq n implies 1 leq y ), ensuring that ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers. 4. **Finding ( n ) in Terms of ( x ) and ( y )**: Given the equation ( x = n - y + 1 ), we can solve for ( n ): [ n = x + y - 1 ] Substituting this expression for ( n ), we get: [ m = frac{(x + y - 1)^2 + (x + y - 1)}{2} + y ] 5. **Simplifying the Formula for (f(x, y))**: Now, expand and simplify: [ f(x, y) = frac{(x + y - 1)^2 + (x + y - 1)}{2} + y ] [ = frac{(x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2x - 2y + 1) + (x + y - 1)}{2} + y ] [ = frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2x - 2y + 1 + x + y - 1}{2} + y ] [ = frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - x - y}{2} + y ] 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the polynomial ( f(x, y) ) that maps ( x ) and ( y ) to non-triangular numbers when ( x ) and ( y ) range over positive integers is: [ f(x, y) = frac{(x + y)(x + y - 1)}{2} + y ] The polynomial ( f(x, y) ) does indeed exist and correctly maps to non-triangular numbers.

Since the degree of the polynomial is given as 5, we can deduce that the term -3x^{m+1}y is the term that dictates this degree.

Applying this to our case, we have ({sqrt{x}-frac{1}{x}})^7, which means n=7, so the sum of the binomial coefficients is 2^7 = 128. Thus, we conclude that [ text{Sum of the binomial coefficients} = 2^7 = 128. ] So, option A is boxed{text{correct}}. **Option B: Largest Binomial Coefficient** For the binomial expansion (a + b)^n, the largest binomial coefficient occurs for the terms where k = frac{n}{2} if n is even, and there are two equally largest coefficients for k = frac{n}{2} and k = frac{n}{2} + 1 if n is odd.

Then, DP = DQ, so APDQ is a kite. Since AD perp PQ, A and D_1 must coincide. Thus, PA = PD = QD = QA, which means APDQ is a square. Therefore, angle A = 90^circ must hold. 2. **Consider D as the Midpoint of BC:** - Since APDQ is a rectangle, angle PD_1Q = angle PDQ = 90^circ = angle PAQ, so APDQD_1 is cyclic with diameter PQ. Moreover, angle APQ = angle PQD = angle PQD_1 = angle PAD_1 implies AD_1QP is a cyclic isosceles trapezoid. Hence, AD_1 and PQ have the same perpendicular bisector, so DP = DQ follows from DA = R = DD_1.

It's clear that AD_1QP is still an isosceles trapezoid. Since BDP and CDQ are also isosceles right triangles, we have BP cdot PA = PD cdot DQ = AQ cdot QC.

To find out the gratuity amount, we subtract the total cost before gratuity from the total bill: 840 (total bill) - 700 (cost before gratuity) = 140 (gratuity amount) To find the percentage of gratuity, we divide the gratuity amount by the total cost before gratuity and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (140 / 700) * 100 = 20% So, the percentage of gratuity added to the bill was boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"A cistern is normally filled in 8 hours but takes a certain number of hours longer to fill because of a leak in its bottom.

When the cistern is being filled with the leak present, the effective rate at which it fills is the rate of filling minus the rate of leaking. So, the effective rate is: ( frac{1}{8} - frac{1}{40.00000000000001} ) To find the common denominator, we can multiply 8 by 40.00000000000001: ( frac{40.00000000000001}{8 times 40.00000000000001} - frac{8}{8 times 40.00000000000001} ) ( frac{40.00000000000001 - 8}{320.0000000000001} ) ( frac{32.00000000000001}{320.0000000000001} ) Now, we simplify the fraction: ( frac{32.00000000000001}{320.0000000000001} = frac{1}{10.000000000000003} ) This means the effective rate of filling the cistern with the leak is ( frac{1}{10.000000000000003} ) of the cistern per hour. To find out how long it takes to fill the cistern at this rate, we take the reciprocal of the effective rate: ( 10.000000000000003 ) hours Since it normally takes 8 hours to fill the cistern without the leak, the additional time taken due to the leak is: ( 10.000000000000003 - 8 = 2.000000000000003 ) hours So, it takes an additional boxed{2.000000000000003} hours to fill the cistern due to the leak."},{"prompt":"Let ( O ) be the center of the circle inscribed in the triangle ( ABC ).

Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs (non-parallel sides) are equal in length, and the height will form two right triangles within the trapezoid, one on each side. The difference in the lengths of the bases is 13 - 7 = 6. This difference will be split equally between the two right triangles, so each will have a base of 6/2 = 3 units. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height (h) of the trapezoid. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b): c^2 = a^2 + b^2 In this case, the hypotenuse is the length of the leg of the trapezoid (5 units), and one side is half the difference in the lengths of the bases (3 units).

Solving for k, we find k=-8. **Solution Enhancement**: First, we find overrightarrow{{BD}} by using the equation overrightarrow{{BD}}=overrightarrow{{BA}}+overrightarrow{{AD}}=-overrightarrow{{AB}}+overrightarrow{{CD}}=-(2overrightarrow{e_{1}}+koverrightarrow{e_{2}})+(2overrightarrow{e_{1}}-overrightarrow{e_{2}})=overrightarrow{{e_{1}}}-(k+1)overrightarrow{{e_{2}}}. Since points A, B, and D are collinear, overrightarrow{{AB}} and overrightarrow{{BD}} are parallel, so there exists a scalar lambda such that overrightarrow{{AB}}=lambdaoverrightarrow{{BD}}. Comparing coefficients of overrightarrow{e_{1}} and overrightarrow{e_{2}} on both sides, we get lambda=2 and -(k+1)=4lambda. Solving for k, we find k=-8. **Final Answer**: boxed{k=-8} (3) **Translation & Formatting**: In triangle ABC, if (sqrt{3}b-c)cos A=acos C, we have (sqrt{3}sin B-sin C)cos A=sin Acos C. Solving for cos A, we find cos A=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. **Solution Enhancement**: First, we use the sine rule to substitute b and c in terms of their corresponding angles B and C. Then, we simplify the equation and solve for cos A. We have sqrt{3}sin Bcos A-sin Ccos A=sin Acos C. Adding sin Ccos A to both sides and factoring, we get sqrt{3}sin Bcos A=sin(A+C)=sin B. Dividing both sides by sqrt{3}cos A, we get sin B=sqrt{3}cos A, and solving for cos A, we find cos A=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. **Final Answer**: boxed{cos A=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} (4) **Translation & Formatting**: In triangle ABC, if a^{2}-b^{2}=sqrt{3}bc and sin C=2sqrt{3}sin B, we have c=2sqrt{3}b. Using the cosine rule, we find cos A=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, so A=30^circ. **Solution Enhancement**: From the given identity a^{2}-b^{2}=sqrt{3}bc, we can express c in terms of b as c=2sqrt{3}b. Next, apply the cosine rule to find cos A in terms of b and c. We have cos A=frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2bc}. Substituting c=2sqrt{3}b into the equation, we get cos A=frac{b^{2}+(2sqrt{3}b)^{2}-(b^{2}+bcsqrt{3})}{2b(2sqrt{3}b)}=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Since A is an angle of a triangle, it must be a positive acute angle. Therefore, A=30^circ. **Final Answer**: boxed{A=30^circ}"},{"prompt":"On a grid board of size n times n, black and white square tiles are placed, and each square tile exactly occupies the position of one grid cell. First, the 1st layer of tiles is placed arbitrarily, and then a restriction condition is recalled: each black tile should be adjacent to an even number of white tiles, and each white tile should be adjacent to an odd number of black tiles. When placing the 2nd layer of tiles, it should make all the tiles on the 1st layer satisfy this condition. If all tiles on the 2nd layer meet this condition, there is no need to place a 3rd layer. Otherwise, a 3rd layer of tiles is required to ensure that all tiles on the 2nd layer meet the conditions, and this process continues. Is there a way to place the 1st layer of tiles in such a manner that this process never ends?","completion":"To address the problem, we need to determine whether there exists an infinite process of placing black and white squares according to the given constraints. We'll start by analyzing the decisive points given hint and then proceed to prove whether such an infinite process exists or not. 1. **Finite Initial Configurations**: - First, we note that there are a limited number of ways to place the initial layer of black and white squares on the n times n grid. Let's denote these initial configurations as ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k ), indicating only a finite number ( k ) of initial configurations. 2. **Potential for Periodicity**: - If we continue placing squares, the condition ( (2) ) suggests that if there exists any sequence where the same configuration reoccurs at two different layers, this will lead to periodicity. Simply put, once a repeated pattern emerges, it will continue indefinitely, repeating every ( T ) layers where ( T ) is the period. 3. **Detailed Observation on Layers**: - Assuming the absence of infinite configurations, i.e., every possible placement eventually leads to repetitions, let the total number of distinct configurations for consecutive two layers be denoted by ( D ). This number is also finite. 4. **Contradiction via Infinite Process**: - Consider the continuous placement of new layers. Given the grid size ( n times n ), as soon as we exceed the total number ( D ) of distinct configurations, by the pigeonhole principle, a pair of consecutive layers ( i, i+1 ) and some ( j, j+1 ) must be equivalent. 5. **Periodic Cycle Identification**: - When ( i, i+1 ) layers match ( j, j+1 ), this signifies the start of a cyclic pattern. Define ( T = j - i ). We observe: - Layers ( i+1, i+2 ) would match ( j+1, j+2 ) - Tracing back, we align that each sequence ultimately matches layers before it, leading to a periodic progression of length ( T ). 6. **Ensuring the Continuity Requires No Further Layers**: - Suppose in layer ( k ), if adding further ensures the problem conditions are upheld only by maintaining previous constructions, additional laying isn't needed. If: - ( k ) and ( k+1 ) are ( 1, 2 ) analogs repeating - Thus constructing next ( k+2, k+3 ) unwinds identically. 7. **Violation Leads to Conclusive Proof**: - Assuming an infinite loop contradicts the non-stop requirement since: - The finite occurrence guarantees an eventual stop. - Each non-repetition breaks the supposed constraints, promptly terminating placing further. Hence, based on the logical construction, **no infinite black and white squares placement exist**, adhering precisely to the given conditions across any n times n grid.

Therefore, the degree of ( P(x) ) is also ( 4n ). 3. **Divisibility by polynomials of even degree:** Since ( P(x) ) is always positive and has no real roots, it can only be divisible by polynomials with even degrees. This is because any polynomial of odd degree must have at least one real root. 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** We need to show that ( P(x) ) cannot be written as a product of ( n+1 ) non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. If ( P(x) ) were to be factored into ( n+1 ) non-constant polynomials, each polynomial must have an even degree. The degrees of these polynomials must sum to ( 4n ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these polynomials must have degree 2. 5. **Assume two polynomials of degree 2:** Suppose ( P(x) ) can be factored as: [ P(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) cdots ] where ( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b ) and ( g(x) = x^2 + cx + d ) are two of the factors. 6. **Properties of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ):** Since ( P(x) ) is always positive, ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) must also be always positive for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).

Evaluate ( f(6) ): [ f(6) = 6^2 + 6a + b = 36 + 6a - a = 36 + 5a ] Thus, ( 36 + 5a ) must be either 1 or 13: [ 36 + 5a = 1 implies 5a = -35 implies a = -7 ] or [ 36 + 5a = 13 implies 5a = -23 implies a = -frac{23}{5} ] Since ( a ) must be an integer, the only possible value is ( a = -7 ). 9. **Check the polynomial ( f(x) ):** If ( a = -7 ), then: [ f(x) = x^2 - 7x + 7 ] The discriminant of ( f(x) ) is: [ Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 7 = 49 - 28 = 21 ] Since the discriminant is positive, ( f(x) ) has real roots, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that ( f(x) ) must be always positive.

Starting with the given condition, acos B + bcos A = 2ccos C, we apply the Law of Sines: frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. This lets us express cos B and cos A in terms of sin A and sin B respectively, leading to the equation sin Acos B + sin Bcos A = 2sin Ccos C. 2. Utilizing the sum-to-product trigonometric identities, the left-hand side of the equation can be transformed into sin(A+B). Since A+B+C=pi, we have A+B=pi-C. Therefore, sin(A+B) = sin(pi - C) = sin C. 3. The given equation then simplifies to sin C = 2sin Ccos C, implying sin C(1 - 2cos C) = 0. Since sin C ≠ 0 for C in (0,pi), we must have 1 - 2cos C = 0 leading to cos C = frac{1}{2}. 4. The equation cos C = frac{1}{2} gives us the value of C directly, as cos C = cos frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, C = frac{pi}{3}. Part (2): Perimeter of triangle ABC 1. Given that the area of triangle ABC is 2sqrt{3} and using the formula for the area of a triangle (S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}absin C), we can substitute C = frac{pi}{3}, which has sin C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. This gives us the equation frac{1}{2}abfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2sqrt{3}. 2. Simplifying the area equation, we find that frac{sqrt{3}}{4}ab = 2sqrt{3}. Solving for ab gives us ab = 8. 3. Next, applying the Law of Cosines with c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C and substituting C = frac{pi}{3} (where cos C = frac{1}{2}), we get c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - abcdot3.

From the analysis above, none of the years from 2010 to 2021 maintain the property. Only in the year **2022** can no valid permutation produce a smaller number than itself (considering no leading zeros). # Conclusion: boxed{2022}"},{"prompt":"Prove that among any three consecutive integers greater than 7, at least one of the numbers has at least two distinct prime factors.","completion":"1. Consider three consecutive integers ( n ), ( n+1 ), ( n+2 ) where ( n > 7 ). 2. Assume for the sake of contradiction that each of these integers has at most one distinct prime factor. 3. First, examine ( n ): - If ( n ) is even, then ( n = 2^m ) for some integer ( m ). - Given ( n+2 ) is also even, let ( n+2 = 2^k ) for some integer ( k ). Thus, [ n + 2 = 2^k implies 2^m + 2 = 2^k implies 2 = 2^k - 2^m ] Since the only integers ( k ) and ( m ) that satisfy this equation are ( k = 2 ) and ( m = 1 ), which gives ( n = 2 < 7 ), this contradicts ( n > 7 ). 4. Next, consider when ( n ) is odd: - If ( n = 3^a ) for some integer ( a ), then for ( n+1 ), [ n+1 = 2^b ] This equation simplifies to ( 3^a + 1 = 2^b ). According to Catalan's conjecture (now Mihăilescu's theorem), the only solutions are ( (a, b) = (1, 3) ), which means ( n = 2 ) again, contradicting ( n > 7 ). - Consider the prime factor ( p = 3 ): [ n text{, } n+1 text{, or } n+2 text{ must be divisible by 3} ] If ( n = 3^k ), this means: [ n+1 = 2^m ] The only solution to this is ( n = 2 ), as previously stated, leading to a contradiction. If ( n+2 = 3^k ): [ 3^k - 2^m = 1 ] The only solutions are ( (m, k) = (3, 2) ), leading to: [ n + 2 = 9 implies n = 7 ] Again contradicts ( n > 7 ) condition. 5. Having examined all cases, we conclude that our initial assumption is false. Therefore, among the three consecutive integers ( n ), ( n+1 ), ( n+2 ), at least one must have at least two distinct prime factors.

Therefore, we have: [ 2csin B = (2a-c)frac{sin C}{cos C} ] Since sin C neq 0, we can simplify this equation to: [ 2sin Bcos C = 2sin A - sin C ] Using the sine addition formula, sin(A + B) = sin Acos B + cos Asin B, and knowing that A + B + C = pi (or 180^circ), we can rewrite 2sin A as 2sin(B+C): [ 2sin Bcos C = 2(sin Bcos C + cos Bsin C) - sin C ] Simplifying further, we get: [ 2sin Ccos B = sin C ] Dividing both sides by sin C (since sin C neq 0), we have: [ 2cos B = 1 ] Therefore, cos B = frac{1}{2}. Given that B is an angle in a triangle and thus lies in the interval (0, pi), we find: [ B = frac{pi}{3} ] So, the measure of angle B is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}.

This is because both terms, -frac{1}{x} (which decreases as x increases, but is negative throughout the interval, thus contributing positively to the slope) and x (which increases linearly), contribute to the overall increase of f(x) in the interval. Therefore, within the interval left[-2,-1right], f(x) achieves its minimum value at x = -2 and its maximum value at x = -1. Calculating these: - At x = -2, f(-2) = -frac{1}{-2} - 2 = -frac{3}{2}. - At x = -1, f(-1) = -frac{1}{-1} - 1 = 0.

This implies that for such a proportion, the product of the means should equal the product of the extremes. - Therefore, we have the equality: [ a_1a_4 = a_2a_3 ] 3. **Checking other Combinations**: - Next, consider another set with four distinct values: (a_1, a_2, a_3,) and (a_5). - Similarly, to form a geometric proportion from these four numbers, the following equality must hold: [ a_1a_5 = a_2a_4 ] 4. **Deriving a Contradiction**: - From the equalities derived above: [ a_1a_4 = a_2a_3 ] [ a_1a_5 = a_2a_4 ] - Notice that we can substitute (a_2a_3) for (a_1a_4) in the second equation: [ a_1a_5 = a_1a_4 = a_2a_3 ] - This simplifies to: [ a_1a_5 = a_2a_3 ] - Due to (a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5), this setup leads to conflicting results in the ordering, suggesting that (a_5) must be equal to another smaller (a_i), which is not possible. 5. **Conclusion**: - The contradiction we find here indicates that our initial assumption of having five distinct values is flawed. - Therefore, the numbers can take at most four distinct values. Since we have (4n) numbers and only four possible values, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one value must be repeated at least ( frac{4n}{4} = n ) times.

This implies the distances: [ OA = frac{a(R + x)}{R} quad text{and} quad OB = frac{a(R + y)}{R} ] 3. **Generalizing the Tangents**: If the tangencies are external: [ (O A cdot O B) = left(frac{a}{R}right)^{2}(R + x)(R + y) ] 4. **Considering Internal Tangencies**: For internal tangencies (when both tangencies are internal): [ (O A cdot O B) = left(frac{a}{R}right)^{2}(R - x)(R - y) ] 5. **Mixed Tangencies (One External, One Internal)**: When one tangency (e.g., circle with radius (x)) is external and the other (circle with radius (y)) is internal: [ (O A cdot O B) = left(frac{a}{R}right)^{2}(R - y)(R + x) ] # Conclusion: The solution depends on the nature of the tangents: - If both tangencies are external or internal: [ text{Length of the common tangent} rightarrow left(frac{a}{R}right)^2 (R + x)(R + y) quad text{or} quad left(frac{a}{R}right)^2 (R - x)(R - y) ] - If one tangency is external and the other internal: [ text{Length of the common internal tangent} rightarrow left(frac{a}{R}right)^2 (R - y)(R + x) ] This forms a comprehensive theorem for both sets of conditions.

Consequently, we observe that: [ angle AB_1M = angle ABM + angle CB_1M = angle BAM + angle CA_1M = angle A_1BM ] and [ angle BA_1M = angle CB_1M ] This implies that triangle AB_1M sim triangle BA_1M by AA similarity criterion since two angles of both triangles are equal.

Since CA_1 = p - b = BA_2 and CB_1 = AB_2, where p is the semiperimeter of triangle ABC, A, B, and C line segments are respectively equal in length: [ frac{B_2 M_1}{A_2 M_1} = frac{sin B_2 CM_1}{sin A_2 CM_1} = frac{sin C A_1 B_1}{sin C B_1 A_1} = frac{CB_1}{CA_1} = frac{AB_2}{BA_2} ] 5. Hence B_2 M_1 = A_2 M_2 and frac{B_2 M_1}{A_2 M_1} will uniquely satisfy the condition for point X on the arc A_2CB_2 of circle S. Thus, M_1 = M_2 owing to uniqueness.

To find the minimum value of f(m) + f'(n) within the interval [-1, 1], we consider the possible extremum points of f(x) and f'(x) within this interval. However, since the problem asks for the minimum value of f(m) + f'(n), and given the forms of f(m) and f'(n), we can directly evaluate these at the endpoints of the interval because the cubic and quadratic functions involved do not have extremum points that would affect the minimum within the interval [-1, 1]. Evaluating at the endpoints, we find: - For m = -1: f(-1) = -(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - 4 = -2, - For m = 1: f(1) = -(1)^3 + 3(1)^2 - 4 = -2, - For n = -1: f'(-1) = -3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) = -9, - For n = 1: f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 6(1) = 3.

This is crucial because the mean is the axis of symmetry for the normal distribution curve. 2. **Understanding the Given Probability P(X < 4) = 0.8:** This tells us that the probability of X being less than 4 is 0.8, which means 80% of the distribution lies to the left of X = 4. 3. **Calculating P(X < 0) Using Symmetry:** The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. Given P(X < 4) = 0.8, we know that 4 is to the right of the mean 2. By symmetry, the probability of X being greater than 4 is the same as the probability of X being less than 0, since 0 is equally distant from the mean 2 but on the opposite side. Therefore, P(X < 0) = P(X > 4). 4. **Calculating P(X > 4):** Since we know that P(X < 4) = 0.8, it follows that P(X > 4) = 1 - P(X < 4) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 due to the total probability rule, which states that the sum of probabilities of all outcomes in a probability space is 1. 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, P(X < 0) = P(X > 4) = 0.2.

Let's denote the center of the incircle of triangle ABC as point O. 3.

Let Q be the center of rotation R that maps the segment AM to the segment DN such that point A is mapped to D and point M is mapped to N. 6. Since the angle between lines AM and CN is known (it is equal to the internal angle at vertex A of the triangle ABC), we can determine the point Q. Point Q is the vertex of an isosceles triangle AQD, and the angle angle AQD = 180^{circ} - angle A with points B and Q lying on the same side of line AD. 7. By rotation R, the segment OM transitions to the segment O'N. The point O' can be constructed and verifies that angle ONO' = angle A because the angle between the lines OM and O'N matches with angle A. 8. Hence, point N is found by locating the intersection of the line AC with the arc of the circle on which the segment OO' is seen under the angle angle A. 9.

Suppose, for contradiction, that there is a 4-clique with points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). 3. **Equilateral Triangles:** In a 4-clique, every pair of points is connected by a segment of length 1. Consider the triangle ( triangle ABC ). Since ( AB = BC = CA = 1 ), ( triangle ABC ) must be an equilateral triangle. 4. **Rhombus Formation:** Similarly, consider the triangle ( triangle BCD ). Since ( BC = CD = DB = 1 ), ( triangle BCD ) must also be an equilateral triangle. Now, since ( A neq D ), the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) forms a rhombus with all sides equal to 1. 5. **Angles in the Rhombus:** In a rhombus with all sides equal, the angles between the sides are either ( 60^circ ) or ( 120^circ ). However, in such a configuration, the diagonal ( AD ) would not be equal to 1. This is a contradiction because ( AD ) must be greater than 1 in a rhombus with sides of length 1. 6. **Conclusion from Contradiction:** Since the assumption of a 4-clique leads to a contradiction, there cannot be a 4-clique where all edges have length 1. 7. **Bounding ( tau(n) ):** Without a 4-clique, each point can be connected to at most 3 other points by segments of length 1. This is because if a point were connected to 4 or more points, it would form a 4-clique, which we have shown is impossible. 8. **Counting the Segments:** Each of the ( n ) points can be connected to at most 3 other points, giving a maximum of ( 3n ) connections. However, each segment is counted twice (once from each endpoint), so the total number of segments is at most ( frac{3n}{2} ). 9. **Final Inequality:** Therefore, the number of segments ( tau(n) ) is bounded by: [ tau(n) leq frac{3n}{2} ] However, this bound is not tight enough. We need to show ( tau(n) leq frac{n^2}{3} ). To achieve this, we use the fact that the number of segments grows quadratically with ( n ), and the absence of a 4-clique limits the number of such segments. 10. **Refining the Bound:** By considering the combinatorial properties and the absence of 4-cliques, we can refine the bound to: [ tau(n) leq frac{n^2}{3} ] This can be shown using more advanced combinatorial arguments or geometric considerations, but the key idea is that the absence of 4-cliques significantly limits the number of unit-length segments.

We need to check the condition for k = 1, 2, cdots, 2m - 1. - For ( k = 2i ) (even): [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2i} = (1 + 2 + cdots + i) + (m+1 + m+2 + cdots + m+i) ] Summing each term: [ = frac{i(i+1)}{2} + frac{i(2m+1+i)}{2} ] Simplifying: [ = frac{i(i+1) + i(2m+1+i)}{2} = frac{i^2 + i + 2mi + i}{2} = frac{2mi + 2i^2}{2} = i(m + i+1) ] Therefore: [ = i a_{2i + 1} ] - For ( k = 2i - 1 ) (odd): [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2i - 1} = i(m+i) = (m+i) a_{2i} ] Hence, the conditions are satisfied for all ( k ) when ( n ) is even. Case 2: ( n = 2m + 1 ) (odd) 1. We arrange the first ( 2m ) numbers as in the even case: [ m+1, 1, m+2, 2, cdots, 2m, m ] Then append ( 2m + 1 ) at the end. Thus, we have: [ left(a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2m+1} right) = left(m+1, 1, m+2, 2, cdots, 2m, m, 2m+1 right) ] 2. By our earlier steps, all pairs up to ( 2m ) satisfy the condition. 3. For ( k = 2m ): [ a_{k+1} = 2m + 1 ] and [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2m} = m(2m+1) = (2m+1)m ] Thus, [ 2m+1 mid a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2m} ] Consequently, the conditions are satisfied for all ( k ) when ( n ) is odd.

Let's assume he picks a coin of denomination n altyns. The critical question is what should be n for Foma if he wants to guarantee a win. 3. **Analysis of Strategy**: Let's consider an optimal strategy for Foma. He has to ensure that, by the time the game ends, he has more altyns than Yeryoma. 4. **Turn-by-Turn Dynamics**: After Foma picks the first coin, Yeryoma decides who gets it. There are two scenarios: * **Scenario 1: Yeryoma Keeps the Coin** In this case, Yeryoma's total increases. Foma will then be the chooser next turn if Yeryoma's total is higher. * **Scenario 2: Yeryoma Gives the Coin to Foma** Interestingly, if Yeryoma decides to give the coin to Foma, Yeryoma places himself in a similar situation as Foma. Essentially, they are switching roles, with Foma now deciding the later moves in Yeryoma’s stead. 5. **Subsequent Moves**: The same mechanics applies to every subsequent move, with the chooser being the one with the higher total in altyns. 6. **Proof by Contradiction**: Let's assume Foma has a winning strategy. According to this strategy: - Initially, Foma picks a coin with n altyns. - If Yeryoma keeps the coin, Yeryoma’s sum increases making it imperative for Yeryoma to act accordingly next. - If Yeryoma gives the coin to Foma, Yeryoma is in the same original situation but roles reversed. Given that Yeryoma now follows the same winning strategy, he should end up winning as well. 7. **Contradiction**: The contradiction here arises because if Yeryoma wins by using Foma’s winning strategy, the initial assumption that Foma has a guaranteed winning strategy becomes invalid. 8. **Conclusion**: Since Foma cannot guarantee a win, Yeryoma will always be able to prevent Foma from winning more altyns by following a mirrored strategy. Hence, it’s not possible for Foma to ensure more altyns without a guarantee of successive advantage.

The grocer has 400 pounds of coffee, and 20% of it is decaffeinated. So, the amount of decaffeinated coffee in the initial stock is: 20% of 400 pounds = 0.20 * 400 = 80 pounds Now, the grocer buys another 100 pounds of coffee. Let's call the percent of decaffeinated coffee in the second batch x%.

According to the information given, 28.000000000000004% of the total stock is decaffeinated. So, the total amount of decaffeinated coffee in the stock after the purchase is: 28.000000000000004% of 500 pounds = 0.28 * 500 = 140 pounds We know that the total amount of decaffeinated coffee after the purchase is the sum of the decaffeinated coffee from the initial stock and the decaffeinated coffee from the second batch. So, we can write the equation: 80 pounds (from initial stock) + x pounds (from second batch) = 140 pounds (total decaffeinated) Now, we can solve for x: 80 + x = 140 x = 140 - 80 x = 60 So, 60 pounds of the second batch of coffee was decaffeinated. To find the percent of the second batch that was decaffeinated, we divide the amount of decaffeinated coffee by the total weight of the second batch and multiply by 100: (60 pounds / 100 pounds) * 100 = 60% Therefore, boxed{60%} of the second batch of coffee was decaffeinated."},{"prompt":"Given the sequence a_n=frac{n}{3^n}, find the sum of the first n terms, denoted as S_n.","completion":"First, write out the sum S_n: S_n=frac{1}{3}+frac{2}{3^2}+frac{3}{3^3}+ldots+frac{n-1}{3^{n-1}}+frac{n}{3^n}.

Now, without the loss of generality, let's isolate a_1 in equation (1): a_1 = 4 - 3d quad (3) - Substituting a_1 from equation (3) into equation (2) gives: 2(4 - 3d) + 9d = 5, Simplify it, we get: 8 - 6d + 9d = 5, which simplifies further to 3d = -3. Hence, solving for d gives us: d = frac{-3}{3} = -1. Now, let's insert the value of d back into equation (3) to find a_1: a_1 = 4 - 3(-1) = 4 + 3 = 7.

The gain is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price, and the gain percent is the gain divided by the cost price, multiplied by 100. Gain = S - C Gain Percent = (Gain / C) * 100 We are given that the gain percent is 4/7, so we can write: (4/7) = ((S - C) / C) * 100 We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 100: (4/7) / 100 = (S - C) / C Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for S in terms of C: 4C = 7(S - C) We also know that the cost price of some chocolates is equal to the selling price of 77 chocolates. This means that the total cost price of the chocolates bought is equal to the selling price of 77 chocolates: Total Cost Price = 77S Let's denote the number of chocolates bought at the cost price as N. Then the total cost price can also be expressed as: Total Cost Price = NC Now we have two expressions for the total cost price: NC = 77S We can substitute S from the earlier equation (4C = 7(S - C)) into this equation: NC = 77 * (4C / 7) + 77C Simplifying, we get: NC = 44C + 77C Combining like terms: NC = 121C Now we can divide both sides by C to solve for N: N = 121 Therefore, boxed{121} chocolates were bought at the cost price."},{"prompt":"Let {ABC} be an acute angled triangle, and {H} a point in its interior.

Multiply through by 2: [ x + 2y geq 2 ] Next, let's sketch the line (x + 2y = 2) on the unit square defined by (0 leq x leq 1) and (0 leq y leq 1): We find the intercepts: - For (x = 0): [ 2y = 2 implies y = 1 ] - For (y = 0): [ x = 2 ] However, since (x in [0, 1]), the effective range of (x) is truncated to the boundary of the unit square.

The desired event corresponds to the above region, which is a triangle with vertices at ((0, 1)), ((1, 0.5)) , and ((1, 1)): The area of the triangle can be calculated as follows: 1. Base of the triangle along (x = 1) is given by the vertical distance between (y = 0.5) and (y = 1): [ text{Length of base} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 ] 2.

However, since the number of marbles in each color is constrained between 1 and 7, the actual number of jars flipped can vary depending on the position of ((b, y, r)) within the range. For example, if (b, y, r) are all in the middle of the range (e.g., 4), the maximum number of jars flipped is: [ 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 ] This is because the cube is fully within the range of 1 to 7 for each color. 4. **Determine the minimum number of moves to flip all jars:** Since each move can flip up to 27 jars, and we need to flip all 343 jars, the minimum number of moves required is: [ leftlceil frac{343}{27} rightrceil = 13 ] This is the minimum number of moves required to ensure all jars are flipped at least once. 5. **Determine the possible values of (n):** Since each move flips an odd number of jars (27), the total number of moves (n) must be such that the total number of jars flipped is a multiple of 27. Therefore, (n) must be an odd number greater than or equal to 13. Additionally, since (n leq 2021), the possible values of (n) are all odd numbers from 13 to 2021. 6. **Count the number of possible values of (n):** The sequence of odd numbers from 13 to 2021 is an arithmetic sequence with the first term (a_1 = 13) and the common difference (d = 2).

To determine the sign of f'(x) and thus the intervals of monotonicity, we test intervals around the critical points: - For x in (0, frac{1}{2}) and x > 1, we have f'(x) > 0, which indicates that f(x) is increasing. - For x in (frac{1}{2}, 1), we find f'(x) < 0, meaning f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, the intervals of increase are (0, frac{1}{2}) and (1, +infty), and the interval of decrease is (frac{1}{2}, 1). (2) From the given expression g(x)=f(x)-x+2aln x, and within the domain (0, +infty), We calculate the derivative of g(x): g'(x) = 1 + frac{1}{x^2} + frac{a}{x} = frac{x^2+ax+1}{x^2}.

Thus, the properties identified for triangles extend natural to higher-order polygons. 7. **Conclusion**: Since AA_1, BB_1, and CC_1 form 60^circ with each other at their intersections, these lines also establish an equilateral triangle by geometric properties of concurrent cevians in equilateral triangles.

Now, we can write lg50 as lg(2 cdot 25), and since 25 is 5^2, this becomes lg(2 cdot 5^2). Breaking down the original expression, we first focus on the term lg^2 2. This term is equivalent to (lg2)^2. Next, we look at lg2 cdot lg5. Since logarithms of prime numbers like 2 and 5 cannot be simplified further without additional context, we leave this as is for now.

Now, remembering another logarithmic property that lg(a^b) = b cdot lg(a), we simplify lg5^2 to 2 cdot lg5. So the term lg50 can be expressed as: lg50 = lg2 + 2 cdot lg5. Combining these observations with the original expression: begin{align*} lg^2 2 + lg2 cdot lg5 + lg50 & = (lg2)^2 + lg2 cdot lg5 + (lg2 + 2 cdot lg5) & = lg2 cdot (lg2 + lg5) + lg2 + 2 cdot lg5 & = lg2 cdot 1 + lg2 + 2 cdot lg5 & = lg2 + lg2 + 2 cdot lg5, end{align*} where we used that lg2 + lg5 = lg(2 cdot 5) = lg10, and since lg10 = 1 (for a logarithm with base 10), the term lg2 cdot lg5 becomes lg2 cdot 1. Now, our expression looks cleaner: lg2 + lg2 + 2 cdot lg5 = 2 cdot lg2 + 2 cdot lg5. Since lg2 and lg5 are just numbers, we cannot simplify them further without more context. However, we can notice that we now have a sum of a repeated term and twice another term. Therefore, we finally rewrite the expression as: 2 cdot lg2 + 2 cdot lg5 = 2 times (lg2 + lg5).

These two points are joined by a path. 2. **Count Points Not Joined:** In the remaining set (E setminus {A_1, A_2}), point (A_1) is not joined to at most 397 points, because there are 1991 points total and each point is joined to at least 1593 others. Similarly, point (A_2) is also not joined to at most 397 points in (E setminus {A_1, A_2}). 3. **Existence of a Third Point:** Since there are 1991 points total and each point is not joined to at most 397 others, the number of points in (E setminus {A_1, A_2}) that are not joined to either (A_1) or (A_2) is at most 397 + 397 = 794. Thus, there are at least 1991 - 794 = 1197 points which are joined to both (A_1) and (A_2).

Substituting these values into the linear equation gives us 0 = 110k + b, leading to b = -110k. 3. **Refine the Linear Model:** With b = -110k, the equation becomes y = k(x - 110). This model is valid for 10 < x < 110 since the price must be higher than the cost price (10 yuan/piece) and less than or equal to 110 yuan/piece for sales to occur. 4. **Determine the Daily Profit Function:** The daily profit w can be expressed as w = (x - 10)y. Substituting the refined linear model into this equation gives w = k(x - 10)(x - 110) = k(x^2 - 120x + 1100). This simplifies further to w = k[(x - 60)^2 - 2500]. 5. **Maximize the Profit:** Since k < 0, the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 60.

Equality of vectors means equal magnitude and direction. Collinearity does not have transitivity because the zero vector is collinear with any vector. The sum and difference of two vectors are located on the diagonals of the same parallelogram. If their magnitudes are equal, it can be inferred that the parallelogram is a rhombus, hence the diagonals are perpendicular to each other, and the dot product of the corresponding vectors is (0). The magnitude of a unit vector is (1), but its direction is arbitrary. Starting from the options, verify and eliminate one by one. **Solution** Vectors have two attributes: magnitude and direction. Equality of vectors means equal magnitude and direction. Thus, A is incorrect; Option (B) is correct for three non-zero vectors, If ( overrightarrow{b}) is a zero vector, if ( overrightarrow{a}) and ( overrightarrow{b}) are collinear, and ( overrightarrow{b}) and ( overrightarrow{c}) are collinear, then ( overrightarrow{a}) and ( overrightarrow{c}) being collinear does not necessarily hold, Thus, B is incorrect; When two vectors are perpendicular to each other, the magnitudes of their sum and difference are definitely equal, Thus, C is correct; If ( overrightarrow{a}) and ( overrightarrow{b}) are both unit vectors, then ( overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}=1) does not necessarily hold, When they are perpendicular to each other, the dot product is zero, Thus, D is incorrect.

This is because substituting x with 2-x in the even function property gives us f(1-(2-x)) = f(1+(2-x)) implies f(x-1) = f(3-x) implies f(2-x) = f(x). 2. Since f(-x) + f(x) = 0, we can find the periodicity of f(x) as follows: f(x+4) = f[2-(x+4)] = f(-x-2) = -f(x+2) = -f([2-(x+2)]) = -f(-x) = f(x).

However, congruence of triangles, especially right-angled triangles, requires information about the sides as well. This option only provides information about angles, which is insufficient for determining congruence through the common criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, and HL for right-angled triangles). Therefore, this option aligns with the question's requirement for a condition that cannot determine congruence. - **Option B: One side and one acute angle are congruent.** This condition can lead to the determination of congruent triangles through either the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) or AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) criteria, where the given side is between the two angles or one of the angles is the right angle, respectively. Thus, this option provides sufficient information for determining congruence and does not match the question's criteria. - **Option C: Two legs are congruent.** For right-angled triangles, having two legs (the two sides other than the hypotenuse) congruent directly satisfies the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion, where the angle is the right angle between the two sides. This condition ensures the congruence of the triangles, making this option incorrect for the question's criteria. - **Option D: One leg and the hypotenuse are congruent.** This condition satisfies the HL (Hypotenuse-Leg) criterion, which is specific to right-angled triangles.

Find the ratio of the lateral surface area of the pyramid to the area of the base, given that the intersecting plane is perpendicular to one of the lateral faces (specify which one).","completion":"1. Let ( DO ) be the height of the regular tetrahedron ( DABC ), where ( D ) is the apex, and ( ABC ) is the equilateral triangular base. Define ( M ) and ( N ) as the midpoints of the edges ( DB ) and ( DC ), respectively. We will consider the section formed by these points and the vertex ( A ), denoted as ( triangle MAN ). 2. We assume that the plane ( MAN ) is perpendicular to one of the lateral faces. Let’s hypothesize it is perpendicular to ( ADB ). 3. The triangles ( triangle ADM ) and ( triangle ADN ) are congruent by SSS criterion (Side-Side-Side equality): - ( AD ) is common in both triangles. - ( AM = AN ) because ( M ) and ( N ) are midpoints. - ( DM = DN ) as each is half of the corresponding sides of the original tetrahedron. 4. Because ( triangle ADM ) and ( triangle ADN ) are congruent, their heights dropped to the sides ( AM ) and ( AN ) are equal. 5. However, the height of ( triangle ADM ) is perpendicular to the plane ( MAN ), while the height of ( triangle ADN ) is an inclined line to this plane. This implies these heights coincide with the edge ( DA ) of the pyramid ( DABC ). We have ( angle DAB > angle DAM = 90^circ ), which is impossible as it contradicts the definition of a regular tetrahedron. 6. Thus, the plane ( MAN ) is not perpendicular to the face ( ADB ). Similarly, it cannot be perpendicular to the face ( ACD ) due to similar contradictory conditions. 7. Consequently, the plane ( MAN ) must be perpendicular to the face ( BDC ). 8. Let ( E ) be the midpoint of ( BC ). Then, intersection point ( K ) of ( MN ) and ( DE ) is the midpoint of ( MN ). Thus, the median ( AK ) in ( triangle MAN ) becomes the height because ( triangle MAN ) is isosceles and ( K ) is the midpoint. 9. Since the planes ( MAN ) and ( BDC ) are perpendicular, and the height ( AK ) is perpendicular to the plane ( BDC ), ( AK ) is also the height of the tetrahedron, implying ( AD = AE ). 10.

This is because the distance from the center of the circumcircle to the incenter of a triangle is given by ( OI = sqrt{R^2 - 2Rr} ), where ( R ) is the circumradius and ( r ) is the inradius. 2. **Mixtilinear Incircle Radius**: The radius ( r_A ) of the ( A )-mixtilinear incircle is given as ( r_A = 5r ). It is known that the radius of the ( A )-mixtilinear incircle can be expressed as ( r_A = r cos^2 left(frac{A}{2}right) ).

The maximum value of ( OX ) occurs when ( r ) is at its maximum value, ( r = 1009 ). Given ( R = 2018 ) and ( r = 1009 ), we have: [ OI = sqrt{2018 times (2018 - 2 times 1009)} = sqrt{2018 times 0} = 0 ] This implies that ( I ) coincides with ( O ), and thus ( OX ) is maximized when ( X ) is at the farthest point from ( O ) on the line ( AD ).

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 44 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 44 * (1000 / 3600) m/s = 12.222... m/s Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to completely cross the bridge by dividing the total distance by the speed of the train: Time = Total distance / Speed Time = 550 meters / 12.222... m/s Time ≈ 44.98 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{45} seconds for the train to completely cross the bridge."},{"prompt":"( f ) is a function that maps positive integers to positive integers, ( f(1)=5 ).

The power of ( I ) with respect to circle ( C ) is: [ text{Power of } I text{ w.r.t. } C = IA^2 - r_C^2 ] where ( r_C ) is the radius of circle ( C ) and ( IA ) is the distance from point ( I ) to point ( A ).

To create a three-digit number that is divisible by 3, the sum of the selected digits must also be divisible by 3. We will analyze the situations in which the sum of three selected digits results in a number divisible by 3. 3. There are a few cases where the sum of three digits could be divisible by 3: - All three digits have a remainder of 0. - One digit has a remainder of 0, one has a remainder of 1, and one has a remainder of 2. - All three digits have a remainder of 1. - All three digits have a remainder of 2. 4.

Assume that the expressions are well-defined (i.e., the denominators are non-zero). 3. Let's combine the terms in both expressions to a common denominator. 4. For the first expression (1), combining terms to a common denominator gives: [ frac{a}{m} + frac{bc + np}{bp + cn} = frac{a(bp + cn) + (bc + np)m}{m(bp + cn)} ] 5. Simplify the numerator: [ a(bp + cn) + (bc + np)m = abp + acn + bcm + mnp ] 6. Let ( S ) be the simplified numerator: [ S = abp + acn + bcm + mnp ] 7. Therefore, expression (1) becomes: [ frac{S}{m(bp + cn)} = 0 ] For this fraction to be zero, the numerator ( S ) must be 0. 8. Now consider the second expression (2): [ frac{b}{n} + frac{ac + mp}{ap + cm} ] 9. Combining terms to a common denominator: [ frac{b}{n} + frac{ac + mp}{ap + cm} = frac{b(ap + cm) + (ac + mp)n}{n(ap + cm)} ] 10.

Thus, expression (2) becomes: [ frac{S}{n(ap + cm)} = 0 ] 13. Given ( S = 0 ) from expression (1), this implies ( S = 0 ) for expression (2) as well. Therefore, the second expression also equals zero. 14. Next, consider the possibility of forming additional expressions similar in structure to (1) and (2). 15. Factorizing ( S ) as given: [ S = c(an + mb) + p(ab + mn) ] 16. Use this factorization to form new expressions: [ frac{S}{(an + mb)p} = frac{c(an + mb)}{(an + mb)p} + frac{p(ab + mn)}{(an + mb)p} = frac{c}{p} + frac{ab + mn}{an + mb} ] [ frac{S}{c(ab + mn)} = frac{p}{c} + frac{an + mb}{ab + mn} ] Since ( S = 0 ), both expressions above also evaluate to zero. 17.

According to the information given, the cricketer made 54.54545454545454 percent of his total score by running between the wickets. Let's calculate the runs made by running: Runs made by running = Total score * Percentage of runs made by running Runs made by running = 132 * (54.54545454545454 / 100) Runs made by running = 132 * 0.5454545454545454 Runs made by running ≈ 72 (since we're dealing with runs, we'll round to the nearest whole number) Now, we know that the cricketer also hit 2 sixes, which accounts for 12 runs (2 sixes * 6 runs each = 12 runs). Let's subtract the runs made by running and the runs from sixes from the total score to find out the runs made from boundaries: Runs from boundaries = Total score - Runs made by running - Runs from sixes Runs from boundaries = 132 - 72 - 12 Runs from boundaries = 48 If we assume that each boundary is a four, we can calculate the number of boundaries by dividing the runs from boundaries by 4: Number of boundaries = Runs from boundaries / 4 Number of boundaries = 48 / 4 Number of boundaries = 12 Therefore, the cricketer hit boxed{12} boundaries."},{"prompt":"The radius of a wheel is some cm.

The distance covered by the wheel in 180 revolutions is given as 253.44 cm. Therefore, the distance covered in one revolution is: Distance in one revolution = Total distance / Number of revolutions Distance in one revolution = 253.44 cm / 180 Now, we can equate the distance in one revolution to the circumference of the wheel: C = Distance in one revolution 2 * π * r = 253.44 cm / 180 To find the radius (r), we can rearrange the formula and solve for r: r = (Distance in one revolution) / (2 * π) r = (253.44 cm / 180) / (2 * π) Now, let's calculate the radius: r = (253.44 cm / 180) / (2 * 3.14159) r = (1.408 cm) / (6.28318) r ≈ 0.224 cm Therefore, the radius of the wheel is approximately boxed{0.224} cm.

We need to show that D exists under our premises. 2. **Angle properties:** - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem: [ angle MAB = angle MBC ] Both are angles subtended by the arc MB on k_1, where MB is a chord and BC is a tangent through B. - Also, by the same theorem applied to circle k_2, we have: [ angle MD C = angle MBC ] Since these are subtended by arc MC of k_2. 3. **Parallel lines:** - From the previous equalities of angles: [ angle MAB = angle MDC ] which implies: [ angle DAB = angle MAB = angle MDC = angle ADC ] This shows that: [ AB parallel CD ] 4. **Other parallel lines:** - Similarly, considering angles: [ angle CAD = angle CAM = angle ABM = angle BDM = angle BDA ] and therefore, [ AC parallel BD ] 5. **Parallelogram property:** - Since AB parallel CD and AC parallel BD, it implies that ABDC forms a parallelogram. - In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other.

Since the train and the jogger are moving in the same direction, we need to consider their relative speed to determine how quickly the train catches up to the jogger. The relative speed is the difference between the train's speed and the jogger's speed. The train's speed is 45 km/hr, and the jogger's speed is 9 km/hr. To find the relative speed in km/hr, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed: ( text{Relative speed} = text{Train's speed} - text{Jogger's speed} ) ( text{Relative speed} = 45 text{ km/hr} - 9 text{ km/hr} ) ( text{Relative speed} = 36 text{ km/hr} ) To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s.

Therefore, option A is correct.

Hence, ( y = |cot x| ) is periodic with a period of ( pi ), but it is not monotonically increasing in ( left(0, frac{pi}{2}right) ). 4. **Function: ( y = lg |sin x| )** - The natural logarithm of the absolute sine function ( lg |sin x| ), or ( log |sin x| ), has a period equal to the period of ( sin x ), which is ( pi ). - Over the interval ( left(0, frac{pi}{2}right) ), since ( 0 < sin x < 1 ), ( log |sin x| ) is well-defined and increases from ( -infty ) to 0. Hence, ( y = lg |sin x| ) is periodic with a period of ( pi ), and it is monotonically increasing in ( left(0, frac{pi}{2}right) ). Conclusion: The function which satisfies both properties - being periodic with period (pi) and monotonically increasing in the interval (left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)) - is: [ boxed{D text{ } lg |sin x|} ]"},{"prompt":"f G(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c times d, what is the value of y such that G(3, y, 6, 15) = 300?","completion":"Plugging in the values into the function, we get: [ G(3, y, 6, 15) = 3^y + 6 times 15 ] [ 3^y + 90 = 300 ] Subtracting 90 from both sides: [ 3^y = 210 ] Solving for y, we look for the integer y such that 3^y is closest to 210. Using logarithms: [ y = log_3{210} approx log_3{209.79} approx 4.71 ] Since y should be an integer, the value of y that makes 3^y closest to 210 is y = 5 since 3^5 = 243 and 3^4 = 81.

Substituting x=-1 into the derivative expression, we get: f'(-1)=α(-1)^{α-1} Since f'(-1)=-4, we have the equation: α(-1)^{α-1}=-4 Now, let's analyze the possible values of α. Since (-1)^{α-1} can only be either 1 or -1 (for any real value of α), the only way for the equation to hold true is if α=4. This is because when α=4, (-1)^{α-1}=(-1)^{4-1}=(-1)^{3}=-1, and thus α(-1)^{α-1}=4(-1)=-4, which matches the given condition. Therefore, the value of α is boxed{4}."},{"prompt":"Calculate the value of: sin frac {14pi}{3}+cosleft( frac {25pi}{4}right).","completion":"To find the value of the expression, we can reduce the angles using periodic properties of sine and cosine functions. For sine, the period is 2pi, and for cosine, it is also 2pi. Starting with the sine term: sin frac {14pi}{3} = sinleft(4pi + frac {2pi}{3}right) = sin frac {2pi}{3} We know that sin(2pi + theta) = sin theta, and we applied it twice to reduce the angle frac {14pi}{3} into the acute angle frac {2pi}{3}. Now, for the cosine term: cosleft(- frac {25pi}{4}right) = cosleft(6pi + frac {pi}{4}right) = cos frac {pi}{4} Here, cos(-theta) = cos theta and cos(2pi + theta) = cos theta, so we used the periodic property to first rid the negative sign and then reduce -frac {25pi}{4} into frac {pi}{4}. Combining these results, the expression simplifies to: sin frac {2pi}{3} + cos frac {pi}{4} From special angle values, we know that: sin frac {2pi}{3} = frac {sqrt {3}}{2} and cos frac {pi}{4} = frac {sqrt {2}}{2} Adding the two values together, we get: frac {sqrt {3}}{2} + frac {sqrt {2}}{2} = frac {sqrt {3} + sqrt {2}}{2} Thus, the final answer is: boxed{frac {sqrt {3} + sqrt {2}}{2}}"},{"prompt":"Arrange all proper fractions in a sequence left{a_{n}right}: frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, frac{2}{3}, frac{1}{4}, frac{2}{4}, frac{3}{4}, cdots.
