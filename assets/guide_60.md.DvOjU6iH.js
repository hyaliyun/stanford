We denote the state of the game as the unordered triple (m, n, l), representing the number of sticks in the three piles, where (m, n,) and (l) are positive integers. 2. Let's use L to represent the losing positions and W to represent the winning positions. We aim to analyze these sets for m, n, l in binary. 3. Consider the binary representations of m, n, and l: [ m = (a_1 a_2 cdots a_k)_2, quad n = (b_1 b_2 cdots b_k)_2, quad l = (c_1 c_2 cdots c_k)_2, ] where a_i, b_i, c_i in {0, 1} for i = 1, 2, ldots, k. 4. Define ( d_i = a_i + b_i + c_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). We then categorize the state: - If all ( d_i ) are even, the state (m, n, l) is termed an even state (which is a losing position). - If at least one ( d_i ) is odd, the state (m, n, l) is termed an odd state (which is a winning position). 5. **Key Observation**: - For any move from an odd state, by removing sticks such that the corresponding binary sum becomes even at each digit position, we turn the state into an even state. - Conversely, from an even state, any single move will result in at least one ( d_i ) being odd, thus turning it into an odd state. Example Analysis: - Consider the states (in binary) and their classifications: [ (4, 4, 0), (4, 5, 1) in L, quad (4, 4, 7), (4, 5, 7) in W ] - Binary representation: [ 4 = (100)_2, quad 5 = (101)_2, quad 7 = (111)_2 ] - Let’s categorize (4, 5, 7): - d_1 = 1+1+1=3 (odd), d_2 = 0+0+1=1 (odd), d_3 = 0+0+1=1 (odd) - Since all ( d_i )'s are odd, (4, 5, 7) is an odd state. Strategy Formulation: - Player A (first player) has a winning strategy if the initial state is an odd state. - Player A can always force the game into an even state by optimally removing sticks such that the resulting state sums (in binary) are even. - When Player B (second player) takes a turn from an even state, the transition will force the state back to being odd. - Eventually, Player A will reduce the game to the form (0, 0, 0), at which point Player B cannot make a move. # Conclusion: Thus, Player A has a winning strategy if and only if the initial state (m, n, l) is an odd state. If the initial state is an even state, then Player B can follow an analogous strategy and ensure their own victory.

We will use generating functions and the roots of unity filter to achieve this. 1. **Generating Function Setup:** We start by considering the generating function: [ f(x_1, ldots, x_{16}) = prod_{1 leq i < j leq 16} (1 + x_i x_j) ] Here, (x_i x_j) represents the event that frogs (i) and (j) are friends, and (1) represents the event that they are not friends. 2. **Roots of Unity Filter:** We want to find the sum of the coefficients in (f) where the exponents of all variables are divisible by 4. Using the roots of unity filter, this is given by: [ frac{1}{4^{16}} sum_{a_1=0}^3 cdots sum_{a_{16}=0}^3 f(i^{a_1}, ldots, i^{a_{16}}) ] Here, (i) is the imaginary unit such that (i^2 = -1). 3. **Non-zero Terms:** We need to consider only ((a_1, ldots, a_{16})) such that (f(i^{a_1}, ldots, i^{a_{16}})) is not zero. This means: - We cannot have (a_i + a_j equiv 2 pmod{4}) for any (i, j). - We can have at most one (i) where (a_i = 1). - We can have at most one (i) where (a_i = 3). - We cannot have (i, j) where (a_i = 0) and (a_j = 2). 4. **Case Analysis:** We proceed with casework on the number of (i) where (a_i = 1) or (3). **Case 1:** No (i) such that (a_i = 1) or (3). - All (a_i) are either (0) or (2). - The value of (f) is (2^{binom{16}{2}}), so this case contributes (2 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2}}) possibilities. **Case 2:** One (i) where (a_i = 1), but none where (a_i = 3). - The sum of (f) over both possibilities of the rest of the values (either (0) or (2)) is: [ ((1+i)^{15} + (1-i)^{15}) 2^{binom{16}{2} - 15} ] - We have: [ (1+i)^{15} + (1-i)^{15} = sqrt{2}^{15} left( left( frac{1+i}{sqrt{2}} right)^{15} + left( frac{1-i}{sqrt{2}} right)^{15} right) ] [ = sqrt{2}^{15} (mathrm{cis}(45^circ)^{15} + mathrm{cis}(-45^circ)^{15}) ] [ = sqrt{2}^{15} (mathrm{cis}(-45^circ) + mathrm{cis}(45^circ)) ] [ = sqrt{2}^{15} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = 256 ] - Since there are 16 choices for (i), this case contributes (16 cdot 256 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2} - 15} = 2^{binom{16}{2} - 3}) possibilities. **Case 3:** One (i) where (a_i = 3), but none where (a_i = 1). - This is the same as Case 2, just by swapping (a_i = 0) with (a_i = 2) and vice versa. **Case 4:** One (i) and one (j) with (a_i = 1), (a_j = 3). - The value of (f) is: [ 2(1+i)^{14}(1-i)^{14} 2^{binom{16}{2} - 29} = 2(1+1)^{14} 2^{binom{16}{2} - 29} = 2^{binom{16}{2} - 14} ] - There are (16 cdot 15) choices for ((i, j)), and two choices for the value of the rest of the terms, so this case contributes (15 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2} - 9}) possibilities. 5. **Summing the Cases:** Summing all the cases and dividing by (4^{16}), we get: [ frac{2 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2}} + 2 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2} - 3} + 15 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2} - 9}}{4^{16}} ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{2 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2}} + 2 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2} - 3} + 15 cdot 2^{binom{16}{2} - 9}}{2^{binom{16}{2} + 32}} = frac{2 + frac{1}{2^2} + frac{15}{2^9}}{2^{32}} = frac{2^{10} + 2^7 + 15}{2^{41}} = frac{1167}{2^{41}} ] The final answer is (boxed{1167})"},{"prompt":"Suppose that alpha is inversely proportional to beta, and gamma is directly proportional to beta.

Prove that by reflecting a planar figure successively across the lines (AB, BC, CD, DA), the image obtained after the fourth reflection can be produced from the original figure by a translation.","completion":"To prove the given statement, we need to show that reflecting any planar shape successively across the lines AB, BC, CD, and DA results in a transform that can be achieved by a pure translation. We will assume that triangle ABC has a positive orientation. Even if the opposite case holds, reflecting both the circle and its points over a line in the plane (e.g., the diameter starting at A) would still prove the assertion for the reflected case, and this would validate the statement for the original shape as well. 1. The problem states properties of reflecting a shape over the lines AB, BC, CD, and DA. Begin by considering symmetry properties given in textbooks. 2. Reflecting a shape first over line AB and then over line BC results in the same position as rotating the shape around point B by an angle of 2beta in the negative direction. Here, beta is the angle at B in triangle ABC, and it is less than 180^{circ}. 3. Similarly, reflecting the shape in lines CD and then DA results in a rotation around point D by an angle of 2delta, where delta is the angle at D in triangle CDA. We need to show that the result of these two rotations is equivalent to a translation of the original shape. 4. Perform the proof by considering the location of point D relative to line AC: - **Case 1:** Suppose D lies on the side of AC opposite to B (see Figure 1). In this case, ABCD is a convex quadrilateral. Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, delta = 180^{circ} - beta. Since both triangle ABC and triangle CDA have positive orientation, the plane is rotated 2beta and 2delta in the negative direction, summing to 2(beta + delta) = 360^{circ}, thus returning the plane to its original orientation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_59be330b7e270e24374dg-1.jpg?height=862&width=1196&top_left_y=808&top_left_x=451) Therefore, every direction returns to itself, showing that the combination of these transformations results in a translation. - **Case 2:** Suppose D lies on the same side of AC as B. Then ABCD is not a convex quadrilateral. In this configuration, both delta = beta. The rotation around D by 2delta and the rotation around B by 2beta result in rotations of equal magnitude but in opposite directions. Hence, when performed consecutively, the total effect brings every direction back to itself. Consequently, these two rotations around the points B and D will result in the shape returning to its original orientation, hence behaving like a translation. 5. Final Conclusion: Since both cases show that the transformation results in the original shape, we deduce that the sequence of reflections indeed results in a translation of the original shape.

The key here is noting that much like the original problem, the part common to both octahedra is a smaller octahedron that results from the overlap.

The volume V of a single unscaled octahedron (edge length a=1) is frac{4}{3}. When scaled by factor 2 (a=2), the volume scales by the cube of the scale factor: V=2^3 cdot frac{4}{3} = frac{32}{3}. The region of intersection is half the height and has all other dimensions similar, a volumetric reduction by a factor of frac{1}{8} of the full larger octahedron. Therefore, the volume of the intersection, which forms a smaller octahedron, is calculated as: [ frac{1}{8}timesfrac{32}{3}=frac{32}{24}=frac{4}{3} ] Thus, the volume of the region in three-dimensional space common to both given inequalities is boxed{frac{4}{3}} cubic units."},{"prompt":"Drum X is 1/2 full of oil and Drum Y is 1/3 full of oil.

Now, let's analyze the right-hand side of the equation: Using the logarithm properties, we have: [ log _{frac{1}{3}}left(9 y^{2} - 18 y + 10right) = log _{frac{1}{3}}left(9(y-1)^{2} + 1right) ] Since (9(y-1)^2 + 1 geq 1) for all (y): [ log _{frac{1}{3}}left(9(y-1)^{2} + 1right) leq 0 ] 4. Since the left-hand side of the equation is non-negative and the right-hand side is non-positive, for the equation to hold, both sides must be zero. Therefore, we need to solve the following system: [ left{ begin{array}{l} left| frac{2}{sin (2xy)} right| = 2 log _{frac{1}{3}}left(9 y^{2} - 18 y + 10right) = 0 end{array} right. ] 5. Solving the first equation in the system: [ left| frac{2}{sin (2xy)} right| = 2 ] implies: [ left| sin(2xy) right| = 1 implies sin(2xy) = pm 1 ] Thus, [ 2xy = frac{pi}{2} + kpi quad text{for} quad k in mathbb{Z} implies xy = frac{pi}{4} + frac{kpi}{2} ] 6. Solving the second equation in the system: [ log_{frac{1}{3}}left(9 y^{2} - 18 y + 10right) = 0 ] which simplifies to: [ 9 y^{2} - 18 y + 10 = 1 ] Solving this quadratic equation: [ 9 y^{2} - 18 y + 9 = 0 implies (3y - 3)^2 = 0 implies y = 1 ] 7.

After translating the complex plane such that the origin is moved to ( a ), the vertices of the square are uniformly distributed on a circle. This distribution is obtained by solving the equation: [ (x-a)^4 = b ] where ( b ) is some complex number. 2. **Expansion**: Expanding the given equation, [ (x-a)^4 = x^4 - 4ax^3 + 6a^2x^2 - 4a^3x + a^4 ] The polynomial given in the problem is: [ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s ] Comparing this with ( (x-a)^4 - b ), we get: [ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = x^4 - 4ax^3 + 6a^2x^2 - 4a^3x + a^4 - b ] 3. **Coefficient Comparison**: By comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of ( x ) from the above equations, we get: [ -4a = p quad text{and} quad 6a^2 = q ] [ -4a^3 = r quad text{and} quad a^4 - b = s ] From ( -4a = p ), we obtain: [ a = -frac{p}{4} ] 4. **Nature of ( a )**: Since ( a ) is a rational number and we also have ( a^3 = -frac{r}{4} ) which has to be an integer, this implies that ( a ) must be an integer. Consequently, ( a ) being an integer and ( s = a^4 - b ) also integer shows ( b ) must be an integer. 5. **Radius of the Circumcircle and Area**: The vertices of the square lie on the circle of radius ( |(b)|^{frac{1}{4}} ). Given ( b ) is an integer, and the radius cannot be less than 1.

For example, triangle AOB, triangle BOC, etc., are all isosceles with the point O being the common vertex. 5. **Verification of Conditions**: - Since the pentagon is regular, any three vertices like A, B, C cannot be collinear because they form an interior angle of the pentagon. - Any three points including the center, for example, A, O, B, also do not lie on a single straight line and form an isosceles triangle due to the equal distance from O to any vertex of the pentagon. 6. **Concluding the Maximum Number of Points**: From the above steps, we conclude that the desired configuration can be achieved with 6 points: the five vertices of a regular pentagon and its center.

According to the information given, employee A is paid 150 percent of the sum paid to B. This means that A's salary is 1.5 times B's salary. So, A's salary can be represented as 1.5x. The total amount paid to both employees is Rs. 570. Therefore, we can write the equation: A's salary + B's salary = Total salary 1.5x + x = 570 Combining like terms, we get: 2.5x = 570 Now, we can solve for x (B's salary) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.5: x = 570 / 2.5 x = 228 So, B's salary before tax is Rs. 228. However, both employees have a 10% tax deduction on their salary. To find B's salary after tax, we need to calculate 10% of B's salary and subtract it from the original amount: Tax deduction for B = 10% of 228 Tax deduction for B = 0.10 * 228 Tax deduction for B = 22.8 B's salary after tax deduction = B's salary before tax - Tax deduction for B B's salary after tax deduction = 228 - 22.8 B's salary after tax deduction = 205.2 Therefore, B is paid Rs. boxed{205.2} per week after the tax deduction."},{"prompt":"Consider a sequence of polyhedra P_{i} defined recursively as follows: P_{0} is a regular tetrahedron with a volume of 1.

Since ( L ) is on ( BC ), we need to find the relationship between ( b ) and ( c ). 2. **Find the relationship between ( b ) and ( c ):** Since ( B, L, C ) are collinear, there exists a parameter ( t ) such that: [ (1,1) = t(b,0) + (1-t)(0,c) ] This gives us two equations: [ 1 = tb quad text{and} quad 1 = (1-t)c ] Solving for ( t ) in the first equation: [ t = frac{1}{b} ] Substituting ( t ) into the second equation: [ 1 = left(1 - frac{1}{b}right)c implies 1 = c - frac{c}{b} implies 1 = frac{bc - c}{b} implies b + c = bc ] 3. **Find the coordinates of ( D ):** Point ( D ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), so: [ D = left(frac{b+0}{2}, frac{0+c}{2}right) = left(frac{b}{2}, frac{c}{2}right) ] 4. **Find the coordinates of ( M ):** Since ( BM perp AL ) and ( LR parallel BA ) and ( LS parallel CA ), ( BPRS ) forms a parallelogram.

We need to find the angle between plane (ABC) and plane (AC'D'). 1. **Tetrahedron and Sphere Geometry**: Since the tetrahedron (ABCD) is regular, each edge has equal length and all its vertices lie on a sphere. Let the tetrahedron be inscribed in a cube. The face diagonals of the cube, which connect opposite vertices of the faces, would then correspond to the diameters of the circumscribing sphere. 2. **Intersection and Perpendiculars**: Extend (C'C) and (D'D) so that they intersect at (M) on the edge (AB). From this setup, line segment (MC) will be perpendicular to (AB) and similarly, line segment (MD') will also be perpendicular to (AB). Consequently, (angle CMD') equates to the dihedral angle between planes (ABC) and (AC'D'). 3. **Calculating (sin theta) in (triangle CMD')**: Assume the tetrahedron is inscribed in the cube with side length (a). Consider (triangle CMD') where (M) is the midpoint of (AB): - The side lengths are projected onto the cube facets. - In this right-angled triangle, (MC = MD' = frac{asqrt{2}}{2}) (midpoint to vertices along the cube's face diagonals).

Since (angle ABC = angle CDA) and the diagonals are perpendicular, (ABCD) must be a kite. In a kite, the sum of the lengths of one pair of opposite sides is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other pair of opposite sides, i.e., (AB + CD = BC + AD). 6. It is a well-known fact that a quadrilateral can have an inscribed circle (i.e., it is tangential) if and only if the sum of the lengths of its opposite sides are equal.

We need to show that Roma can ensure that no more than 50 checkers end up in the last cells of their stripes. 1. **Initial Setup**: - Pasha starts by moving checkers such that one group is shifted from the first cell to the second, and another group from the second cell to the third. - If Pasha moves more checkers from the first to the second cell than from the second to the third, Roma will remove the checkers from the second cell. - Conversely, if more checkers are moved from the second to the third cell, Roma will remove those checkers from the third cell. 2. **Strategy Overview**: - Each time a checker is moved from the first cell to the second cell, Roma sacrifices a checker from the second cell if the number of moves in the first stripe is greater. - If Pasha moves ( k ) checkers from the first to the second cell and ( l ) checkers from the second to the third cell, Roma will choose the larger value between ( k/2 ) and ( l ), and remove the corresponding number of checkers. 3. **Reasoning for Movement and Removal**: - If Pasha moves ( k ) checkers from the first to the second cell, Roma sacrifices half the difference when checkers are moved from the second to the third cell. - To ensure advancement of non-removed checkers, each movement from one cell to the next should result in a trade-off that minimizes the checkers reaching the final cell. 4. **Calculation of Checker Sacrifice**: - Having ( n = 100 ) checkers initially, to move a checker from the first to the second cell, Roma sometimes needs to remove at least one checker being moved from the second to the third cell. - When Pasha moves a checker from the second to the third cell, if it was already counted in previous sacrifices, Roma needs to calculate the moves from second to third consequently. - To prevent more than 50 checkers from reaching the final cell, Roma will adjust the sacrifices to keep the progress balanced: [ text{Sacrifice count} = 1 text{ checker from the first to the second cell} + 2 text{ checkers from the second to the third cell} ] - Summing up the sacrifices and moves, Roma ensures that a maximum of ( 100 / 2 = 50 ) checkers can potentially reach the last cells, by removing intermediate checkers accordingly. 5. **Conclusion**: - By careful removals and strategic sacrifices, Roma manages the game such that: [ text{Total checkers in the final cells} leq 50 ] [ boxed{50} ]"},{"prompt":"A number is doubled and 9 is added.

The formula for the maximum number of regions is: [ R_{text{max}} = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1 ] Here's a step-by-step calculation and reasoning: - When ( n = 0 ) (no lines), the plane is just one whole region: [ R_{text{max}}(0) = 1 ] - When ( n = 1 ), the line divides the plane into 2 regions: [ R_{text{max}}(1) = 2 ] - When ( n = 2 ), adding a second line can intersect the first line, dividing the plane into 4 regions: [ R_{text{max}}(2) = 4 ] Generalizing this, each new line can intersect all previous lines, maximizing the number of new regions created. The formula incrementally adds the number of new regions formed by each successive line. The combinatorial argument sums up these contributions, leading to the formula (frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1). 2. **Determine the Minimum Number of Regions:** The minimum number of regions ( R_{text{min}} ) created by ( n ) lines arises when all lines are parallel, so each new line adds exactly one new region. The formula for the minimum number of regions is: [ R_{text{min}} = n + 1 ] Here's the reasoning: - When ( n = 0 ), there is only 1 region: [ R_{text{min}}(0) = 1 ] - When ( n = 1 ), one line creates 2 regions: [ R_{text{min}}(1) = 2 ] - When ( n = 2 ), two parallel lines create 3 regions: [ R_{text{min}}(2) = 3 ] And in general, every new parallel line adds one more region, resulting in ( n + 1 ) regions for ( n ) lines. # Conclusion: - The maximum number of regions created by ( n ) lines in a plane is: [ boxed{frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1} ] - The minimum number of regions created by ( n ) lines in a plane is: [ boxed{n + 1} ]"},{"prompt":"A standard deck of 52 cards consists of 4 suits (hearts and diamonds are red; spades and clubs are black), each containing 13 cards.

We complete the square for the x term to rewrite it as (x^2 - 8x + 16) + y^2 - 16 + 12 = 0, which simplifies to (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 2^2. The center of the second circle is (4, 0) and its radius is r_2 = 2.

Next, we compare this center-to-center distance with the sum of the radii of the two circles: r_1 + r_2 = 3 + 2 = 5. Since the distance between the centers d equals the sum of the radii r_1 + r_2, the circles are tangent to each other externally.

Therefore, the difference in potentials between the extreme spheres must be zero: [ 0 = Delta varphi_B + (varphi_N - varphi_1) = Delta varphi_B + 2varphi_1 ] Here ( Delta varphi_B ) corresponds to the potential difference created by the external electric field over the distance spanned by the chain of spheres ( (N-1)l ), i.e., ( Delta varphi_B = E(N-1)l ). 5. **Substitution and Rearrangement**: Substituting (varphi_1 = k frac{q}{R}) into the equation, we get: [ 0 = E(N-1)l + 2left( k frac{q}{R} right) ] Simplifying this, we obtain: [ E(N-1)l = - 2 k frac{q}{R} ] Solving for (q): [ q = -frac{E(N-1)l R}{2k} ] 6. **Numerical Calculation**: We know the following values: - ( E = 100 text{ V/m} ) - ( N = 50 ) - ( l = 0.3 text{ m} ) - ( R = 0.001 text{ m} ) - ( k = 9 times 10^9 text{ Nm}^2/text{C}^2 ) Substituting these into the expression for (q), we get: [ q = frac{100 cdot 49 cdot 0.3 cdot 0.001}{2 cdot 9 times 10^9} ] Calculating the values step by step: [ q = frac{100 cdot 14.7 cdot 10^{-3}}{18 cdot 10^9} = frac{1470 times 10^{-3}}{18 times 10^9} = frac{1.47}{18 times 10^9} times 10^{-2} = 8.17 times 10^{-11} text{ C} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{8.17 times 10^{-11} text{ C}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that f(x)=2^{|xa|} is an even function defined on mathbb{R}, which of the following inequalities is correct?

The faces of the pyramid, excluding the base, are triangular and share the common vertex at the apex. 2. **Given Conditions**: - Consider a polyhedron (P). - It is given that all faces of (P), except one, have a common vertex (V). 3. **Structure of the Polyhedron**: - Let the polyhedron (P) have (n) faces in total. - Out of these (n) faces, (n-1) faces share the common vertex (V). 4. **Analysis of Shared Vertex**: - Since (n-1) faces share the vertex (V), each of these faces must be triangular. This is because in a polyhedron, if more than three faces shared a common vertex, they must necessarily form triangles to meet at that vertex without ambiguity. 5. **Remaining Face**: - The remaining (n)-th face (which does not share the vertex (V)) must be the base of the pyramid. This face must form a polygon since it does not have vertex (V) and describes the boundary of the bottom of the pyramid. 6. **Connecting to the Apex**: - Therefore, since the (n-1) faces are triangular and they all share a common vertex (V), and the (n)-th face, which does not share (V), serves as the base, the polyhedron meets the definition of a pyramid: - The base is the ((n-1))-sided polygon. - The apex is the common vertex (V), from which triangular faces extend to each edge of the base. Thus, the given polyhedron indeed satisfies the conditions to be a pyramid. # Conclusion: Based on the above steps and observations, we can conclude that a polyhedron where all faces but one share a common vertex is a pyramid.

Setting the two expressions for the final salary equal to each other, we get: (S + (P/100) * S) - 10% * (S + (P/100) * S) = S + 15% * S Expanding the terms, we have: S + (P/100) * S - 0.10 * S - 0.10 * (P/100) * S = S + 0.15 * S Simplifying, we get: S + (P/100) * S - 0.10 * S - 0.10 * (P/100) * S = 1.15 * S Now, we can cancel out the S on both sides: (P/100) * S - 0.10 * (P/100) * S = 0.15 * S Dividing both sides by S, we get: P/100 - 0.10 * P/100 = 0.15 Now, we can solve for P: P - 0.10 * P = 15 0.90 * P = 15 P = 15 / 0.90 P = 16.67 So, the initial percentage increase in Robert's salary was boxed{16.67%} ."},{"prompt":"Given the sequence {a_n} with the general term a_n = frac{n}{n^2 + 90}, find the maximum value among the terms of {a_n}.

Let us break this problem down into a step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding Ship Placement Constraints:** - Each ship occupies a 1x4 area. - Ships cannot touch each other, even at the corners. 2. **Grid Dimensions and Total Ship Occupation:** - The entire grid is a 10x10 array, comprising 100 cells. - Each ship occupies 4 cells. - Therefore, twelve ships occupy: [ 12 text{ ships} times 4 text{ cells} = 48 text{ cells} ] 3. **Feasibility Check:** - The total required cells (48) for ships fit into the 100-cell grid as: [ 100 - 48 = 52 text{ free cells remaining} ] 4. **Ship Arrangement Ensuring No Touching:** - We need to ensure at least one cell (or more if needed) gap between any two ships, both horizontally and vertically. 5. **Example Arrangement:** - Let’s visualize one approach to arranging these ships in rows and columns while keeping the required gaps. - Start placing ships horizontally in even rows and ensuring a gap of at least one cell between the end of one ship and the start of the next one, and leaving an entire empty row between each row of ships. - Example arrangement plan: [ begin{align*} & text{Row 1: } text{Ship 1: Cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)}, text{Gap}, text{Ship 2: Cells (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)} & text{Row 3: } text{Ship 3: Cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}, text{Gap}, text{Ship 4: Cells (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)} & text{Row 5: } text{Ship 5: Cells (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)}, text{Gap}, text{Ship 6: Cells (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)} & text{Row 7: } text{Ship 7: Cells (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)}, text{Gap}, text{Ship 8: Cells (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)} & text{Row 9: } text{Ship 9: Cells (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)}, text{Gap}, text{Ship 10: Cells (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)} end{align*} ] - Similarly, place remaining ships vertically with required gaps.

Let the points on sides (AB), (BC), and (CA) be denoted as follows: - On side (AB): Points (P_1, P_2, P_3, ldots) - On side (BC): Points (Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, ldots) - On side (CA): Points (R_1, R_2, R_3, ldots) 3. **Formation of a Smaller Triangle:** Select any three non-collinear points among the mentioned points (P_i), (Q_i), and (R_i). Without loss of generality, suppose these points are (P_1), (Q_1), and (R_1). 4. **Contradiction:** The three points (P_1), (Q_1), and (R_1) would form a new triangle (T'). To ensure smallest area, the area of (T') should be less than that of (T). However, (T) was chosen as the smallest area triangle of its color, which leads to a contradiction. 5. **Conclusion:** Hence, our initial assumption was incorrect.

Since m, n, p, and q are positive integers, and the factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4, the only possible values for 6-m, 6-n, 6-p, and 6-q that are positive and result in a product of 4 are 2 and 2 (twice), which means 6-m = 6-n = 6-p = 6-q = 2. Therefore, m = n = p = q = 4. However, since the problem states that m, n, p, and q are distinct, this direct approach leads to a contradiction. Given the constraint that the product equals 4 and considering the nature of the problem, we must then think about the factors of 4 in a different way.

Carl's share of responsibility for property damage: 60% of 8,000 = 0.60 * 8,000 = 4,800 Carl's share of responsibility for medical bills: 60% of 17,500 = 0.60 * 17,500 = 10,500 Finally, we add Carl's share of responsibility for property damage and medical bills to find the total amount he personally owes. Total amount Carl owes = 4,800 (property damage) + 10,500 (medical bills) = 15,300 Carl personally owes boxed{15,300} for both property damage and medical bills based on his share of responsibility and insurance payouts."},{"prompt":"Suppose that the graph of [3x^2 + y^2 + 6x 12y + d = 0] consists of a single point.

Similarly, we can express ( m ) in terms of 24 and its remainder as follows: [ m = 24p + 23 ] where ( p ) is the quotient when ( m ) is divided by 24.

Since one fourth of the work is done in 20 days, we can assume that the rate of work with 10 people is: (1/4 work) / (20 days) = 1/80 work per day Now, we need to find out the rate at which the remaining work (which is three fourths) needs to be done to complete it in 75 days. (3/4 work) / (75 days) = 3/300 work per day Simplify the fraction: 3/300 = 1/100 work per day Now we have two rates: - The initial rate with 10 people: 1/80 work per day - The required rate to finish the remaining work in 75 days: 1/100 work per day We can set up a proportion to find out how many people are needed to work at the rate of 1/100 work per day. Let x be the number of people needed to work at the new rate. (10 people) / (1/80 work per day) = (x people) / (1/100 work per day) Cross-multiply to solve for x: 10 * (1/100) = x * (1/80) 10/100 = x/80 80 * (10/100) = x 8/10 = x x = 8 So, the contractor needs 8 people to complete the remaining work in 75 days at the new rate. Since the contractor initially had 10 people and now needs only 8, he must have fired: 10 - 8 = 2 people The contractor fired boxed{2} people after realizing one fourth of the work was done."},{"prompt":"Given cos({αfrac{β}{2}})=frac{{2sqrt{7}}}{7},sin({frac{α}{2}β})=frac{1}{2},frac{π}{2}＜α＜π,0＜β＜frac{π}{2}.

When both taps are opened simultaneously, the net rate at which the cistern gets filled is the rate of the first tap minus the rate of the second tap, which is ( frac{1}{T} - frac{1}{7} ). We are given that when both taps are opened simultaneously, the cistern gets filled in ( 9.333333333333332 ) hours, which can be written as ( frac{28}{3} ) hours (since ( 9.333333333333332 ) is ( 9 + frac{1}{3} ) and ( 9 ) hours is ( 27 ) thirds, so ( 27 + 1 = 28 ) thirds).

Keep in mind, the car's maintenance costs, which compose 30% of his total driving expense, also increase by 10%.","completion":"Let's assume the initial price of petrol in both regions is P per unit (e.g., per liter or per gallon). The car user spends an equal amount of time driving in both regions, so we can consider the average increase in petrol price for the user. The price increase in Region A is 20%, so the new price in Region A is P + 0.20P = 1.20P. The price increase in Region B is 15%, so the new price in Region B is P + 0.15P = 1.15P. Since the user divides his driving equally between the two regions, the average price increase is the average of the two new prices: Average price increase = (1.20P + 1.15P) / 2 Average price increase = (2.35P) / 2 Average price increase = 1.175P This means the average price of petrol has increased by 17.5%. Now, let's consider the maintenance costs. If maintenance costs are 30% of the total driving expense, and they increase by 10%, the new maintenance cost will be 1.10 times the original cost. Since maintenance is 30% of the total cost, the increase in maintenance cost will affect 30% of the total driving expense by 10%, which is an overall increase of 3% in the total driving expense (0.30 * 0.10 = 0.03). Now, we have two increases to consider: a 17.5% increase in petrol costs and a 3% increase in maintenance costs. To keep the overall expenditure constant, the user must cut down his petrol consumption to offset these increases. The total percentage increase in driving expense is the sum of the petrol cost increase and the maintenance cost increase: Total increase = 17.5% (petrol) + 3% (maintenance) Total increase = 20.5% To keep the expenditure constant, the user must reduce his petrol consumption by the same percentage as the total increase in driving expense.

Based on condition ①, we can calculate the elements of B by multiplying each distinct pair of elements in A: - Multiplying 2 and 4 gives 8. - Multiplying 2 and 8 gives 16. - Multiplying 2 and 16 gives 32. - Multiplying 4 and 8 gives 32 (already counted). - Multiplying 4 and 16 gives 64. - Multiplying 8 and 16 gives 128.

The vertex, which is the maximum point, occurs at x = 3, yielding f(3) = 6 times 3 - 3^2 = 9. 2. **Sequence Analysis**: - **Case x_0 = 0**: x_1 = f(0) = 6 times 0 - 0^2 = 0. Hence, all x_n = 0 for n geq 1. This sequence has only one distinct value. - **Case x_0 = 6**: x_1 = f(6) = 6 times 6 - 6^2 = 0. Similarly, all subsequent x_n = 0.

Let us consider a circle ( K ) with center ( Q ) and radius ( r ), which is inscribed in the surface of a unit sphere ( O ) and contains the point ( P ) inside the unit sphere.

Points on this sphere ( S ) (except for the degenerate case ( r=1 )) correspond to the points where planes tangent to ( S ) intersect the surface of the unit sphere in circles of radius ( r ). 3.

The geometrical location of the centers of circles is described by the intersection of sphere ( S ) with another sphere centered at ( P ) and radius ( sqrt{OP^2 + r^2 - 1} ). This intersection yields a circle. 4. In this last subcase, let the intersection circle ( C ) have center ( O' ) and radius ( r' ).

After the competition ends, all contestants line up in front of the dining hall to wait for their meal according to the following rules: 1. The committee arranges each contestant in an initial position in the queue. 2. Every minute, the committee selects an integer ( i ) ((1 leq i leq n)): - If contestant ( C_{i} ) has at least ( i ) contestants in front of them, ( C_{i} ) pays the committee 1 Euro and moves ( i ) positions forward. - If ( C_{i} ) has fewer than ( i ) contestants in front, the waiting process ends and the dining hall opens. (1) Proof that the process must terminate in finitely many steps: Consider the initial queue of contestants as a permutation of the set ({1, 2, dots, n}) denoted by (sigma). Specifically, ( C_{sigma(i)} ) stands in the ( i )-th position in the queue. Define: [ R(sigma) = {(i, j) mid 1 leq i < j leq n, sigma(i) > sigma(j)} ] [ W(sigma) = sum_{(i, j) in R(sigma)} 2^{i} ] When ( R(sigma) = varnothing ), it follows that ( W(sigma) = 0 ). We proceed by contradiction, assuming there exists a sequence of movements such that the process never ends. Suppose a permutation (sigma) changes to a new permutation (sigma') after one movement. Then: [ W(sigma') leq W(sigma) - 1 ] Indeed, if the committee selects number (i), contestant ( C_{i} ) moves forward ( i ) positions. Since there are ( i-1 ) or fewer contestants in front, ( C_{i} ) overtakes at least one contestant ( C_{j} ) with ( j > i ). Therefore, ((i, j) in R(sigma) setminus R(sigma')), implying: [ sum_{(u,v) in R(sigma) setminus R(sigma')} 2^{u} geq 2^{i} ] Considering the new elements in ( R(sigma') setminus R(sigma) ), we have: [ sum_{(u, v) in R(sigma') setminus R(sigma)} 2^{u} leq sum_{k=1}^{i-1} 2^{k} = 2^{i} - 1 ] Thus: [ W(sigma) - W(sigma') geq 1 ] Since ( W(sigma) ) is always a natural number, the operation must terminate after a finite number of steps. [ bboxempty ] (2) Maximum number of Euros the committee can receive: Notice: [ W(sigma) leq sum_{i=1}^{n} (i-1) cdot 2^{i} = 2^{n} - n - 1 ] This equality holds when (sigma) is the reverse order permutation. From part (1), it follows that operations can proceed at most ( 2^{n} - n - 1 ) steps, meaning the committee can receive up to ( 2^{n} - n - 1 ) Euros. Next, we illustrate how the committee can earn exactly ( 2^{n} - n - 1 ) Euros by providing a constructive example: - Initially, set all contestants in reverse order. - The process ends with contestants in correct sequential order, and no more operations can be performed. For ( n = 2 ): - The committee starts with ( C_2, C_1 ) and selects ( C_1 ). Reordering to ( C_1, C_2 ) earns 1 Euro, terminating the process. Let's assume the committee can earn ( 2^{n} - n - 1 ) Euros for ( n ) contestants. Then: For ( n+1 ), start with: 1. Reverse order for first ( n ) contestants: [ 2 (2^{n} - n - 1) + n = 2^{n+1} - (n + 1) - 1 ] Therefore, the committee earns: [ 2^{n+1} - (n + 1) - 1 ] [ boxed{2^n - n - 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the system of equations: [ begin{cases} x + y + z = 0 c x + a y + b z = 0 (x + b)^2 + (y + c)^2 + (z + a)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 end{cases} ] where (a neq b neq c).

Speed in meters per second (m/s) = Speed in kilometers per hour (km/hr) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) = 72 × (1000 / 3600) m/s = 20 m/s Now, the train crosses the platform in 26 seconds.

Since the trains are of equal length and the faster train takes 27 seconds to pass the slower train completely, we can calculate the relative speed between the two trains. The relative speed is the difference in speed between the two trains, which can be calculated as V - 36 km/hr. Since the speeds are in km/hr, we need to convert the relative speed to meters per second to match the units with the length of the trains and the time taken to pass. We do this by multiplying the relative speed by 1000 (to convert kilometers to meters) and then dividing by 3600 (to convert hours to seconds). Relative speed in m/s = (V - 36) * 1000 / 3600 The total distance covered by the faster train to pass the slower train is the sum of the lengths of both trains, which is 37.5 meters + 37.5 meters = 75 meters. The time taken to cover this distance at the relative speed is 27 seconds. So we have the equation: Distance = Relative Speed * Time 75 meters = (V - 36) * 1000 / 3600 * 27 Now we solve for V: 75 = (V - 36) * 1000 / 3600 * 27 To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 3600/27 to get rid of the fraction: 75 * 3600 / 27 = (V - 36) * 1000 Now, calculate the left side: 75 * 3600 / 27 = 10000 Now we have: 10000 = (V - 36) * 1000 Divide both sides by 1000 to solve for V: 10 = V - 36 Now, add 36 to both sides to find V: V = 10 + 36 V = 46 So the speed of the faster train is boxed{46} km/hr."},{"prompt":"f x ¤ y = ((x + y) ^ (3/2) (x y) ^ (3/2)) / ((x * y) ^ (1/3)). then (√(3 + 2√2)) ¤ (√(7 4√3)) =","completion":"To solve this, we need to substitute the given values of x and y into the provided formula and simplify step by step.

According to the modular arithmetic, consider ( n mod 3 ): - If ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 0 + 0 + 11 equiv 11 equiv 2 pmod{3} ). - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 1 + 1 + 11 equiv 13 equiv 1 pmod{3} ). - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 4 + 2 + 11 equiv 17 equiv 2 pmod{3} ). Hence, in all cases, ( n^2 + n + 11 notequiv 0 pmod{3} ), Therefore, ( n^2 + n + 11 ) is not divisible by 3. 5. Similarly, consider whether the number can be divisible by 5. According to the modular arithmetic, consider ( n mod 5 ): - If ( n equiv 0 pmod{5} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 0 + 0 + 11 equiv 11 equiv 1 pmod{5} ). - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{5} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 1 + 1 + 11 equiv 13 equiv 3 pmod{5} ). - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{5} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 4 + 2 + 11 equiv 17 equiv 2 pmod{5} ). - If ( n equiv 3 pmod{5} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 9 + 3 + 11 equiv 23 equiv 3 pmod{5} ). - If ( n equiv 4 pmod{5} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 16 + 4 + 11 equiv 31 equiv 1 pmod{5} ). Therefore, in all cases, ( n^2 + n + 11 notequiv 0 pmod{5} ), and ( n^2 + n + 11 ) is not divisible by 5. 6. Finally, consider whether ( n^2 + n + 11 ) is divisible by 7. According to the modular arithmetic, consider ( n mod 7 ): - If ( n equiv 0 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 0 + 0 + 11 equiv 11 equiv 4 pmod{7} ). - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 1 + 1 + 11 equiv 13 equiv 6 pmod{7} ). - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 4 + 2 + 11 equiv 17 equiv 3 pmod{7} ). - If ( n equiv 3 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 9 + 3 + 11 equiv 23 equiv 2 pmod{7} ). - If ( n equiv 4 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 16 + 4 + 11 equiv 31 equiv 3 pmod{7} ). - If ( n equiv 5 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 25 + 5 + 11 equiv 41 equiv 6 pmod{7} ). - If ( n equiv 6 pmod{7} ), then ( n^2 + n + 11 equiv 36 + 6 + 11 equiv 53 equiv 4 pmod{7} ). Hence, in all cases ( n^2 + n + 11 notequiv 0 pmod{7} ), so ( n^2 + n + 11 ) is not divisible by 7. 7. Now, we check if it is divisible by 11. For ( n = 0 ): [ n^2 + n + 11 = 0^2 + 0 + 11 = 11 ] Clearly, 11 is divisible by 11. Hence, the smallest prime number ( p ) such that ( n^2 + n + 11 ) is divisible by ( p ) for some integer ( n ) is ( 11 ).

This implies: [ lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1 = lfloor sqrt{n+1} rfloor ] This condition is only met when (n+1) is a perfect square because taking the square root of a number just below a perfect square and the perfect square itself spans the integer part to increase by one. Thus, let (n+1 = k^2) for some integer (k). 3. **Substitution and analysis:** If (n+1 = k^2), then (n = k^2 - 1). Substituting back we get the equation: [ lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor = k-1 quad text{and} quad lfloor sqrt{n+1} rfloor = k ] 4. **Prime divisor conditions:** The provided equation becomes: [ P(n) + (k-1) = P(n+1) + k ] Simplifying, this gives: [ P(n) = P(n+1) + 1 ] 5. **Identifying (n) and (n+1):** Note that both (P(n)) and (P(n+1)) must be prime numbers. Assuming (P(n) = 3) and (P(n+1) = 2), we denote (n = 3^a) and (n+1 = 2^b). Plugging these in: [ 3^a = 2^b - 1 ] 6. **Modular arithmetic analysis:** Modulo 3 analysis shows: [ 2^b equiv 1 , (text{mod} , 3) ] This is true only if (b) is even. Let (b = 2c). Thus, [ 3^a = (2^c - 1)(2^c + 1) ] Since both factors (2^c - 1) and (2^c + 1) cannot both be divisible by 3 (they differ by 2), one has to be 1 (since (2^c - 1) and (2^c + 1) should be coprime). 7. **Solving the factor equality:** For this to hold, (2^c - 1 = 1) so: [ 2^c = 2 implies c = 1 ] Hence, [ b = 2c = 2 ] Substituting back, we have: [ n = 3^{a} quad text{and} quad n + 1 = 2^2 = 4 ] This gives: [ n = 3 , Rightarrow , 3^a = 3^1 implies a = 1 ] In conclusion, the only (n) satisfying the condition is (n = 3).

We can use the properties of the equilateral triangle and the special angles to find the lengths and then the areas. 1. **Triangle Properties**: Since angle BAE = 30^circ, triangle ABE is a 30-60-90 triangle, with AE being the side opposite the 30^circ angle and AB being the hypotenuse. Therefore, AE = AB/2 = s/2. 2. **Calculate Lengths**: Triangle AEC also forms a 30-60-90 triangle with AE as the shorter leg, making EC the longer leg, which is sqrt{3}/2 times AE. Hence, EC = sqrt{3}/2 cdot (s/2) = ssqrt{3}/4. 3. **Area Ratio Calculation**: The area ratio of triangle ABE to triangle AEC is the ratio of their bases BE and EC, given that they share the same height from A perpendicular to BC. Since BE = BC - EC = s - ssqrt{3}/4 = s(1 - sqrt{3}/4), the ratio of areas is frac{BE}{EC} = frac{s(1 - sqrt{3}/4)}{ssqrt{3}/4} = frac{4(1 - sqrt{3}/4)}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4 - sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3} - 3}{3}.

The detailed steps are: [ E_1 = { x in E mid exists n in mathbb{N}, g^n(f(x)) = x } ] [ E_2 = E setminus E_1 ] 4. **Verify Bijection Correspondence:** - For elements in E_1, map using f, - For elements in E_2, map using the partial inverse of g iteratively until it maps into F. 5. **Decomposition to Achieve Full Set Correspondence:** - Restricting the decomposition of E to E_1 and E_2 ensures that every element of E is mapped into F.

These inequalities are equivalent to showing: [ angle BFD < angle BAC ] and [ angle AFE < angle ABC. ] 5. By construction, since ( PD perp BC ) and ( PF perp AB ), the points ( B ), ( F ), ( P ), and ( D ) lie on a common circle. Thus, we get: [ angle BFD = angle BPD. ] 6. Additionally, since ( angle PBD > angle OBH ), where ( OH perp BC ) and ( H ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( O ) to ( BC ), we have: [ 90^circ - angle PBD < 90^circ - angle OBH, ] leading to: [ angle BPD < angle BOH. ] 7. Since ( O ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ), we know: [ angle BOH = frac{1}{2} angle BOC = angle BAC. ] 8. Therefore, we derive: [ angle BFD = angle BPD < angle BOH = angle BAC, ] hence proving ( angle BFD < angle BAC ). 9. Similarly, one can prove: [ angle AFE < angle ABC. ] 10.

First Method: 1. **Conceptual Idea:** - The plane we are looking for can be thought of as a tangent plane to a cylinder. - The cylinder's axis is the given line, and its radius is the given distance from the line. 2. **Visualization:** - In a suitable projection plane (which we'll call the 4th projection plane), the cylinder projects as a circle. - The projection of a parallel line passing through the given point will be indicated in this 4th projection plane. 3. **Construction:** - From the given point's projection in this plane, draw a tangent to the circle. - This tangent line in the 4th projection plane will serve as one trace of the required plane. - The second trace of the plane is perpendicular to the line of sight in the 3rd projection plane. Second Method: 1. **Existence Condition:** - There is a solution only if the distance from the given point to the given line is greater than the specified distance. 2. **Initial Setup:** - Through the given point, draw a plane perpendicular to the given line. - This plane will intersect the cylinder in a circle, and the line in a point which will be the center of this circle. 3. **Tangent Construction:** - In this perpendicular plane, draw the tangents from the given point to the circle. - The points of tangency represent the points where the required plane will touch the cylinder, giving us the traces. 4. **Final Plane Determination:** - One of the sought planes will contain one of these tangents. - The other line in this plane is the one passing through the given point and parallel to the given line.

According to the information given, in the second hour, he traveled 20 percent farther than in the first hour. This means he traveled ( D + 0.20D = 1.20D ) in the second hour. We are told this distance is 24 miles, so we can write the equation: ( 1.20D = 24 ) To find ( D ), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20: ( D = frac{24}{1.20} ) ( D = 20 ) miles So, James traveled 20 miles in the first hour.

However, a and b should be digits (0-9), thus putting a limit on the values of k. Since k must be a digit and a should be a non-zero digit (for overline{ab} to be a two-digit number), we now need to check feasible values for k: 3. Consider possible values for k that would allow overline{ab} = overline{a(ka)} to result in a valid two-digit number: - **k = 1**: [ b = 1a = a Rightarrow overline{ab} = overline{aa} ] Meaning 10a + a = 11a.

We wish to find all integers (n > 1) such that (f(n) = n). 2. We can alternatively define f(n) as: [ f(n) = sum_{k mid n} d(k) ] where the sum is taken over all positive divisors (k) of (n). 3.

This problem should be solved by understanding the meaning of the average and the method of calculating the average, followed by calculation and deduction to reach the conclusion.

Therefore, the profit from producing one piece of handicraft B is x + 105 yuan, given that the profit from B is 105 yuan more per day than from A. According to the problem, when the profit is 30 yuan for A and 240 yuan for B, the quantity of A and B produced is equal. This gives us the equation: frac{30}{x} = frac{240}{x + 105} Solving this equation for x: begin{align*} 30(x + 105) &= 240x 30x + 3150 &= 240x 3150 &= 210x x &= 15 end{align*} Therefore, the profit from producing one piece of handicraft A is x = 15 yuan.

The total profit W can be calculated as: W = 15 times 2(65 - m) + (130 - 2m)m Simplifying the equation: begin{align*} W &= 15 times 2(65 - m) + (130 - 2m)m &= 1950 + 130m - 2m^2 - 30m &= -2m^2 + 100m + 1950 &= -2(m^2 - 50m - 975) &= -2(m - 25)^2 + 3200 end{align*} Since the coefficient of m^2 is negative, the maximum value of W occurs when m = 25.

First, let's find the area of the outer circle: The diameter of the outer circle is 30, so its radius is 30/2 = 15. The area of the outer circle (A_outer) is π * 15^2 = π * 225.

If fleft(xright)=0 has two distinct real roots alpha and beta, find the range of real numbers for m, and determine the value of alpha cdot beta.","completion":"# Solution Detailed Steps **(1)** To find the value of a and prove that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty): Given f(x)=acdot{3}^{x}+frac{1}{{3}^{x}} is an even function, we have: f(-x) = acdot{3}^{-x} + frac{1}{{3}^{-x}} = acdot{3}^{-x} + {3}^{x} = f(x) This implies: acdot{3}^{-x} + {3}^{x} = acdot{3}^{x} + frac{1}{{3}^{x}} Simplifying: Rightarrow (a-1)({3}^{x}-{3}^{-x}) = 0 Since this holds for any x in mathbb{R}, we conclude a-1=0, hence a=1. Thus, f(x)={3}^{x}+frac{1}{{3}^{x}}. To prove monotonicity, consider 0 < x_{1} < x_{2}: f(x_{1})-f(x_{2}) = {3}^{x_{1}}+frac{1}{{3}^{x_{1}}}-{3}^{x_{2}}-frac{1}{{3}^{x_{2}}} = left({3}^{x_{1}}-{3}^{x_{2}}right)left(1-frac{1}{{3}^{x_{1}+x_{2}}}right) = left({3}^{x_{1}}-{3}^{x_{2}}right)left(frac{{3}^{x_{1}+x_{2}}-1}{{3}^{x_{1}+x_{2}}}right) Since 0 < x_{1} < x_{2}, it follows that {3}^{x_{1}}-{3}^{x_{2}} < 0 and {3}^{x_{1}+x_{2}} > 1. Therefore, f(x_{1})-f(x_{2}) < 0, implying f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2}). Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty). **Conclusion for (1):** We found a=1, and proved that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty). **(2)** To find the range of real numbers for m, and determine the value of alpha cdot beta: Given f(x)={(log_{2}x)}^{2}+2log_{2}x+m, let log_{2}x=t, then x in [frac{1}{8},4] translates to t in [-3,2]. Consider g(t)=t^{2}+2t+m for t in [-3,2]. Since f(x)=0 has two distinct real roots alpha and beta, g(t)=0 must also have two distinct real roots t_{1}=log_{2}alpha and t_{2}=log_{2}beta in [-3,2]. From this, we have: Delta = 4-4m > 0 -3 < -1 < 2 g(-3) = 9 - 6 + m = 3 + m geq 0 g(2) = 4 + 4 + m = 8 + m geq 0 Solving these inequalities gives -3 leqslant m < 1.

If all three additives are used simultaneously, what is the combined percentage increase in the time between maintenance checks?","completion":"To find the combined percentage increase in the time between maintenance checks when all three additives are used simultaneously, we need to calculate the individual increases and then combine them. Let's start with the original maintenance interval of 50 days. Additive A increases the interval by 20%, so the new interval with Additive A would be: 50 days + (20% of 50 days) = 50 days + (0.20 * 50 days) = 50 days + 10 days = 60 days Additive B increases the interval by 30%, so the new interval with Additive B would be: 50 days + (30% of 50 days) = 50 days + (0.30 * 50 days) = 50 days + 15 days = 65 days Additive C increases the interval by 40%, so the new interval with Additive C would be: 50 days + (40% of 50 days) = 50 days + (0.40 * 50 days) = 50 days + 20 days = 70 days However, we cannot simply add these percentages together to find the combined increase because the increases are not independent of each other; they compound. To find the combined effect, we need to multiply the individual effects: The combined effect of all three additives would be: (1 + 20%) * (1 + 30%) * (1 + 40%) = (1.20) * (1.30) * (1.40) Now, let's calculate this: = 1.20 * 1.30 * 1.40 = 1.56 * 1.40 = 2.184 This means that the combined effect of all three additives is a 2.184 times increase in the maintenance interval. To find the percentage increase, we subtract 1 (the original value) from this combined effect and then multiply by 100: (2.184 - 1) * 100 = 1.184 * 100 = 118.4% So, the combined percentage increase in the time between maintenance checks when all three additives are used simultaneously is boxed{118.4%} ."},{"prompt":"(Science) If the random variable xi sim N(2, 2^2), then the value of Dleft( frac {1}{4}xi right) is __________.","completion":"Since the random variable xi follows a normal distribution xi sim N(2, 2^2), it can be concluded that the variance of the random variable xi is 4.

Since the coordinates of point P involve cos alpha, we infer that cos alpha > 0 because 0 < alpha < frac{pi}{2}. Moreover, the x-coordinate is negative, and the y-coordinate is positive, which means that theta is in the second quadrant. In the second quadrant, sin theta is positive, and cos theta is negative. Now, we need to calculate the values of sin theta and cos theta. Using the coordinates (-4cos alpha, 3cos alpha), we can find the radius (r) of the circle formed by the point and the origin: r^2 = (-4cos alpha)^2 + (3cos alpha)^2 = 16cos^2 alpha + 9cos^2 alpha = 25cos^2 alpha r = sqrt{25cos^2 alpha} = 5|cos alpha| = 5cos alpha Now, we calculate sin theta and cos theta using the following definitions: sin theta = frac{text{opposite side}}{text{hypotenuse}} = frac{3cos alpha}{5cos alpha} = frac{3}{5} cos theta = frac{text{adjacent side}}{text{hypotenuse}} = frac{-4cos alpha}{5cos alpha} = -frac{4}{5} Therefore, we have: sin theta + cos theta = frac{3}{5} - frac{4}{5} = boxed{-frac{1}{5}}"},{"prompt":"Twothirds of all the animals on my street are cats and the rest are dogs.

Since two-thirds of all the animals are cats, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the total number of animals by two-thirds: [ frac{2}{3} times 300 = 200 ] This means there are 200 cats on the street. Given that the total number of animals is 300, we can find the number of dogs by subtracting the number of cats from the total number of animals: [ 300 - 200 = 100 ] Therefore, there are 100 dogs on the street.

We know that ferry P is slower than ferry Q by 3 kilometers per hour. Therefore, the speed of ferry Q is: Speed (ferry Q) = Speed (ferry P) + 3 km/h Speed (ferry Q) = 6 km/h + 3 km/h Speed (ferry Q) = 9 km/h Now we can calculate the time it takes for ferry Q to travel the distance of 54 km: Time (ferry Q) = Distance (ferry Q) / Speed (ferry Q) Time (ferry Q) = 54 km / 9 km/h Time (ferry Q) = 6 hours Finally, to find out how many hours longer the journey of ferry Q is compared with the journey of ferry P, we subtract the time taken by ferry P from the time taken by ferry Q: Additional time (ferry Q) = Time (ferry Q) - Time (ferry P) Additional time (ferry Q) = 6 hours - 3 hours Additional time (ferry Q) = 3 hours So, the journey of ferry Q is boxed{3} hours longer than the journey of ferry P."},{"prompt":"The values of (x) and (y) are always positive, and (x^3) and (y) vary inversely.

For our purposes, we describe the constraints and the alternation. 5. **Checking the Alternation Condition**: - Start at any vertex, say A. - From A, we must ensure the colors alternate as we traverse around the perimeter connecting all roads emanating from A to other vertices. - Label each edge exiting A alternately yellow and red. 6. **Ensuring Intersection Constraint**: - Construct edges ensuring that no two roads intersect more than once or pass through another city. - Verify that the colors continue to alternate as we label the roads connecting the remaining vertices B, C, D, and E. 7. **Verification**: - Each vertex/ city has 4 edges. - Labeling demonstrates that around each city, the edge colors alternate correctly while not violating any intersection constraints. - Ensuring every edge intersection is unique and only occurs once confirms the existence of the described map under given conditions. # Conclusion: Given all constraints and checks are satisfied, Baron Munchausen’s description of the map can indeed be true: boxed{text{Могут}}"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest fourdigit number in Pascal's triangle?","completion":"Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle.

To solve the system, consider a specific setup where one of the variables (x_i = 1) while the rest are zero. Let's verify if this setup satisfies both equations: [ x_{i} = 1, quad x_{1} = ldots = x_{i-1} = x_{i+1} = ldots = x_{n} = 0 ] 3. Substitute (x_i = 1) and all other (x_j = 0) into the first equation: [ (0)^k + ldots + (1)^k + ldots + (0)^k = 1 ] This correctly simplifies to (1 = 1), satisfying the first equation. 4. Now, substitute (x_i = 1) and all other (x_j = 0) into the second equation: [ (1 + 1) cdot (1 + 0) cdot ldots cdot (1 + 0) = 2 ] This simplifies to (2 cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot ldots cdot 1 = 2), thus satisfying the second equation as well. 5.

We are given that 8 gallons of 35% butterfat milk is already present, and we are adding 12 gallons of milk in total. This means that x + 8 = 12, so x = 12 - 8 = 4 gallons of 10% butterfat milk must be added. Now, let's calculate the total amount of butterfat in the final mixture. The 8 gallons of 35% butterfat milk contain 8 * 0.35 = 2.8 gallons of butterfat. The 4 gallons of 10% butterfat milk contain 4 * 0.10 = 0.4 gallons of butterfat. The total amount of butterfat in the final mixture is 2.8 + 0.4 = 3.2 gallons. The final mixture has a total of 12 gallons of milk. To find the desired percentage of butterfat in the final mixture, we divide the total butterfat by the total volume of the mixture and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Desired percentage of butterfat = (3.2 gallons butterfat / 12 gallons milk) * 100 Desired percentage of butterfat = (0.2667) * 100 Desired percentage of butterfat = 26.67% So, the desired percentage of butterfat in the final mixture is approximately boxed{26.67%} ."},{"prompt":"Find the mass percentage of Cl in Carbon tetrachloride.","completion":"Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is composed of one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms.

We denote the points as (A, B, C, ) and (D). There are (binom{4}{2} = 6) pairwise distances between these points. Let’s analyze the cases based on configurations maintaining exactly two distinct distance values. Case 1: No Equilateral Triangle In this scenario, the points form geometric shapes without an equilateral triangle. **Subcase 1.1: Square Configuration** 1. Assume that (AB = BC = CD = DA = d_1), i.e., all sides' lengths are the same. 2. Then, the diagonals (AC) and (BD) must be equal, which gives (AC = BD = d_2), a distinct distance from (d_1). For this case, the points (A, B, C,) and (D) form a **square**. - The pairwise distances in a square are the sides (d_1) and the diagonals (sqrt{2}d_1), keeping the condition of exactly 2 distinct distances. This subcase contributes **one configuration**. **Subcase 1.2: Regular Pentagon Projected with Four Points** 1. Choose four points from a regular pentagon (A, B, C, D), removing one vertex. 2. In such a setting, (AB = BC = CD = AD = d_1), and the diagonals (AC) and (BD) will be the same and represented as another distinct distance (d_2). Thus, the points form part of a **projected regular pentagon**. There is only one possible configuration here, contributing **one configuration**. Case 2: Equilateral Triangle Involved This case involves at least one equilateral triangle (ABC) of side (d_1). **Subcase 2.1: No further pairs the same as (d_1)** 1. The fourth point (D) must lie equidistant from all vertices of the equilateral triangle. 2. (D) must be at the centroid of triangle (ABC) to maintain exactly two distinct distances (d_1). Thus, this configuration involves a **point at the centroid of an equilateral triangle**. Contributing **one configuration**. **Subcase 2.2: One more pair (AD = d_1)** 1. Constrain (D) such that it forms another side equal to (d_1). 2. The point (D) lies on a perpendicular bisector of (BC) leading to two intersections. These points create a **kite with exactly two congruent sides**. This contributes **two kite configurations**. **Subcase 2.3: Both (AD = BD = d_1)** 1. (D) forming sides equal to (d_1) with respect to two vertices (A) and (B). 2. This implies a rhombus formation, specifically forming a rhombus with angles measuring (60^circ). These produce a **rhombus configuration**. This contributes **one configuration**. # Conclusion: By summing up all the valid geometric configurations: - Square: 1 - Subset of Regular Pentagon: 1 - Equilateral triangle with centric point: 1 - Kite configurations: 2 - Rhombus: 1 Total configurations: (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6).

When Vasya's yield increases by 10% and Misha's yield increases by 20%, the total yield change is given to be 4 kg: [ 0.1x + 0.2y = 4 ] 6.

Multiply equation (2) by 10 to get rid of decimals: [ y - z = -5 ] [ y = z - 5 ] 9. Substitute ( y = z - 5 ) in equation (3): [ 0.1x + 0.2(z - 5) = 4 ] [ 0.1x + 0.2z - 1 = 4 ] [ 0.1x + 0.2z = 5 ] This is the new (3). 10. We now have: [ 0.4z + 0.2x = 1 ] [ 0.1x + 0.2z = 5 ] 11. Multiply the latter equation by 2: [ 0.2x + 0.4z = 10 ] 12. Now subtract the original (1) from this equation: [ 0.2x + 0.4z - 0.4z - 0.2x = 10 - 1 ] [ 0 = 9 ] 13.

We have: A + B + C + D + E + F = 510 We know that F = 180 and E = 100, so we can substitute these values in: A + B + C + D + 100 + 180 = 510 Combining the known values gives us: A + B + C + D = 510 - 280 A + B + C + D = 230 Now, to minimize A, we want to maximize the values of B, C, and D.

This means that the amount of salt she could buy at the original price (before the reduction) for Rs. 400 is 10 kg less than what she can buy at the reduced price. Let's denote the amount of salt she could buy at the original price as S kg. Therefore, at the reduced price, she can buy S + 10 kg. At the original price, the cost for S kg of salt would be: Cost = S * P At the reduced price, the cost for (S + 10) kg of salt would be: Cost = (S + 10) * 0.8P Since both costs are equal to Rs. 400, we can set up the following equation: S * P = (S + 10) * 0.8P Now, we can solve for S: S * P = 0.8P * S + 0.8P * 10 S * P - 0.8P * S = 0.8P * 10 S * P * (1 - 0.8) = 0.8P * 10 S * P * 0.2 = 8P S = 8P / (0.2P) S = 8 / 0.2 S = 40 So, the lady could originally buy 40 kg of salt for Rs. 400.

In 5 hours, vehicle Y will have covered the 22-mile gap and overtaken vehicle X.

Here, B_0 and C_0 are the feet of the altitudes from B and C respectively. - Since K lies on the circle with diameter AH, the points A, B_0, C_0, H, K are concyclic. - The angle bisector AK of angle AB_0C_0 implies that K is the midpoint of the arc B_0C_0 of the circle AB_0C_0, so KB_0 = KC_0. - Given MB_0 = MC_0 and TB_0 = TC_0, it follows that M, K, T are collinear. - Since AH and MM_a are parallel, triangle AHK sim triangle M_aMK, leading to MK = MM_a. 3. **Step 2: Show that MN perp AM_a** - N and M are the projections of M_a on AB and BC respectively.

First, consider the given hyperbola (xy = 1). We need to find the shortest distance between a fixed point (Q(a, b)) in the first quadrant and a point (P(x, y)) in the third quadrant that lies on the hyperbola. 2. For the given problem, we take point (Q(a, b)) as the center of a circle. The shortest distance from (Q) to the hyperbola will be when the circle, centered at (Q) with radius (|QP|), is tangent to the hyperbola at point (P(x_1, y_1)). 3. For the circle to be tangent to the hyperbola, the line segment (QP) must be perpendicular to the tangent to the hyperbola at point (P(x_1, y_1)). 4. The equation of the tangent to the hyperbola (xy = 1) at point (P(x_1, y_1)) is given by: [ y_1x + x_1y = 2 ] 5. We need to ensure that the slope of this tangent line at (P) multiplied by the slope of the line (QP) equals (-1), indicating perpendicularity. The slope of the tangent line at (P(x_1, y_1)) is: [ -frac{y_1}{x_1} ] 6. The slope of the line segment (QP) is: [ frac{y_1 - b}{x_1 - a} ] 7. Using the fact that the product of these slopes must be (-1): [ frac{y_1 - b}{x_1 - a} cdot left(-frac{y_1}{x_1}right) = -1 ] 8. Simplifying the above equation, we get: [ frac{(y_1 - b) y_1}{(x_1 - a)x_1} = 1 ] 9. From the hyperbola equation, we know (x_1 y_1 = 1) and from point (Q) we know (a cdot b = 1). Thus: [ frac{y_1^2 - by_1}{x_1^2 - ax_1} = 1 ] 10. Solving for (y_1) and (x_1), we substitute (y_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}}) and (x_1 = -a^{-frac{1}{3}}).

According to the information given: - 76 employees are women. - 60 employees are married. Since 2/3 of the men are single, this means 1/3 of the men are married. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of employees: Number of men = 100 - 76 = 24 men. Now, 1/3 of these men are married: Married men = 1/3 * 24 = 8 men. Since we know that 60 employees are married in total, we can find the number of married women by subtracting the number of married men from the total number of married employees: Married women = 60 - 8 = 52 women. Now, we are told that 70 percent of married women have more than 5 years of service. So, the number of married women with more than 5 years of service is: Married women with >5 years service = 70% of 52 = 0.7 * 52 = 36.4 ≈ 36 women (since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round to the nearest whole number). Finally, we want to find the fraction of the total women employees that are married with more than 5 years of service: Fraction = Number of married women with >5 years service / Total number of women Fraction = 36 / 76. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: Fraction = (36/4) / (76/4) = 9 / 19. So, the fraction of the total women employees who are married with more than 5 years of service is boxed{9/19} ."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)= frac {x}{ln x}, when 0 < x < 1, the correct size relationship among the following options is (quadquad).

The derivative of the function is f′(x)= frac {ln x-1}{(ln x)^{2}}. Since (ln x)^{2} > 0, according to the monotonicity of the logarithmic function, when 0 < x < 1, we have ln x-1 < 0. Therefore, f′(x) < 0, which means the function is monotonically decreasing. Thus, f(x^{2}) > f(x). By the process of elimination, options A, B, and D are incorrect, and option C is correct. So, the answer is boxed{text{C}}. From 0 < x < 1, we get x^{2} < x. To compare the sizes of f(x) and f(x^{2}), we need to determine whether the function is increasing or decreasing.

To do this, we examine the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation, which is given by Delta = b^{2} - 4ac, where a=1, b=-(2k+1), and c=4k-3. Calculating Delta, we have: [ Delta = (2k+1)^{2}-4(4k-3) = 4k^{2}+4k+1-16k+12 = 4k^{2}-12k+13 = (2k-3)^{2}+4 ] Since (2k-3)^{2} geqslant 0 for all real k, adding 4 to it ensures that Delta > 0 for all real k.

Since AB + BC = 2k + 1 > 0 and AB cdot BC = 4k - 3 > 0, the valid value for k is k = 3. Therefore, the sum of the sides AB + BC = 2k + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.

Therefore, it is sufficient to check the arcs that correspond to the maximum and minimum angle values. 4. **Calculate the radii and center distances of the arcs corresponding to boundary values**: [ begin{array}{lcc} alpha_{min} = 11.35^circ: & t_{1, max} = 99.7 text{m}, & r_{1, max} = 101.7 text{m} alpha_{max} = 11.45^circ: & t_{1, min} = 98.7 text{m}, & r_{1, min} = 100.7 text{m} beta_{min} = 4.65^circ: & t_{2, max} = 245.9 text{m}, & r_{2, max} = 246.8 text{m} beta_{max} = 4.75^circ: & t_{2, min} = 240.6 text{m}, & r_{2, min} = 241.5 text{m} end{array} ] 5. **Note the implications of centers and radii on the highest observer height**: From the previously calculated values, the common highest point, (P^*), and the distance from the gate points to this point are examined: [ u = t_1 + r_1, quad u = t_2 + r_2 - d ] Using the respective maximum and minimum values: [ u = 99.7 + 101.7 = 201.4 text{m}, quad 245.9 + 246.8 - 290 = 202.7 text{m} ] And for minimum values: [ u = 98.7 + 100.7 = 199.4 text{m}, quad 240.6 + 241.5 - 290 = 192.1 text{m} ] 6. **Determine the height range considering the calculated distances**: By substituting these values into the provided formulae and diagrams, the highest point was determined to be around: [ h_{max} approx 73 text{m} ] and considering symmetry and possible configurations: [ -73 text{m} leq h leq 73 text{m} ] 7. **Summarize the results**: Given that the visibility range incorporates every surveyed angle, the tallest observable point will maintain accuracy within the set intervals expressed above. Therefore, the maximum observer's viewpoint height is approximately 73 meters as initially concluded.
