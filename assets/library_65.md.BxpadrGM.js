Step 2: Theorem Proof for Acute Angles Firstly, we need to establish that for any m-gon P_1 P_2 cdots P_m with vertices from P, there can be at most two acute angles, and they must be adjacent. **Proof:** Consider the m-gon P_1 P_2 cdots P_m. Assume we have at least one acute angle P_1. Since P is a convex set, all the other interior angles must satisfy: [ angle P_2 P_j P_1 = pi - angle P_2 P_1 P_j > frac{pi}{2} text{ for } 3 leq j leq m-1. ] Additionally: [ angle P_{j-1} P_j P_{j+1} > frac{pi}{2}. ] If angle P_1 and angle P_m are both acute and adjacent: [ angle P_1 P_2 P_3 + angle P_{m-1} P_m P_1 > pi. ] Thus, having angle P_1 and angle P_2 both acute and adjacent means all the other interior angles in the polygon must be obtuse which corroborates our theorem.

This case happens binom{r-1}{m-2} ways. 2. **All Remaining Vertices Lie on the Same Arc:** - In this case, the remaining m-2 vertices lie within the other vertices on the same arc but without breaking any rules of forming non-adjacent acute angles. - In total, for each such configuration, there are: [binom{r}{m-2}] Therefore, combining all possibilities together, we count such m-gons as follows: [ sum_{r=1}^{n} left(binom{r-1}{m-2}+ binom{r}{m-2}right) = sum_{r=1}^{n}binom{r+1}{m-1} ] Since each configuration of P accounts for (2n+1) possibilities: [ (2n+1) cdot sum_{r=1}^{n}binom{r+1}{m-1} ] Clearly, summing up for both allocations, we use the combinatorial identities and simplifications to find the exact count number of P: [ (2n+1) left( mathrm{C}_{n+1}^{m-1}+ mathrm{C}_{n}^{m-1} right) ] From the additive properties of binomial coefficients. # Conclusion The number of m-sided convex polygons such that exactly two interior angles are acute is given by: [ boxed{(2n+1) left( mathrm{C}_{n+1}^{m-1}+ mathrm{C}_{n}^{m-1} right)} ]"},{"prompt":"Convert the curve (C_{1}): (x^{2}+y^{2}8x10y+16=0) into a polar equation.","completion":"Solution: Substitute (begin{cases}x=rhocos theta y=rhosin thetaend{cases} ) into (x^{2}+y^{2}-8x-10y+16=0), We get (rho^{2}-8rhocos theta-10rhosin theta+16=0), Therefore, the polar equation of (C_{1}) is (boxed{rho^{2}-8rhocos theta-10rhosin theta+16=0})."},{"prompt":"Let m and n represent two different lines, and alpha and beta represent two different planes.

Since there are 50 stations, a passenger can travel from one station to any of the other 49 stations.

This extends to all elements, meaning (i) must be a common multiple of all cycle lengths. 4. **Sum of Cycle Lengths**: Given that the permutation consists of disjoint cycles, the total length of the cycles equals the size of the permutation. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the cycles must be 11. 5. **Maximizing the Order**: - To find the maximum possible order, we need to find the maximum least common multiple (LCM or PPCM in French) of integers that sum to 11. - Possible integer combinations that sum to 11 include: - (11) (one cycle): ( text{LCM}(11) = 11 ) - (6 + 5) (two cycles): ( text{LCM}(6, 5) = 30 ) - Other combinations such as (1 + 5 + 5), (2 + 3 + 6), etc., all yield lower LCM results. 6. **Calculation of LCM**: - For the partition (6) and (5), the least common multiple is computed as: [ text{LCM}(6, 5) = frac{6 times 5}{text{GCD}(6, 5)} = 30 ] - No other pair or set of numbers summing to 11 will yield a higher LCM than (6) and (5). # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum order of a permutation of length 11 is given by the least common multiple of the partition (6) and (5), which is 30.

Therefore: [ IJ = IB_1 = BB_1 = b ] 4. **Distance Calculation:** Consider the distances: [ a + b + c = A_1I + IJ + JC_1 geq A_1C_1 ] Using the properties of the equilateral triangle and the Law of Cosines in the context of the hexagon, we get: [ A_1C_1 = sqrt{A_1B_1^2 + A_1C_1^2 + A_1B_1 cdot A_1C_1 cdot cos(120^circ)} ] Simplifying using (cos(120^circ) = -frac{1}{2}): [ A_1C_1 geq frac{(A_1B_1 + A_1C_1)sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{(x + y)sqrt{3}}{2} ] 5. **Inequality for Each Side:** Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other sides: [ b + c + d geq frac{(y + z)sqrt{3}}{2} ] [ c + d + e geq frac{(z + t)sqrt{3}}{2} ] [ d + e + f geq frac{(t + u)sqrt{3}}{2} ] [ e + f + a geq frac{(u + v)sqrt{3}}{2} ] [ f + a + b geq frac{(v + x)sqrt{3}}{2} ] 6. **Summing the Inequalities:** Adding all these inequalities, we get: [ 3(a + b + c + d + e + f) geq (x + y + z + t + u + v)sqrt{3} ] Simplifying, we find: [ a + b + c + d + e + f geq frac{x + y + z + t + u + v}{sqrt{3}} ] 7. **Final Inequality:** Since ( p = a + b + c + d + e + f ) and ( p_1 = x + y + z + t + u + v ), we have: [ p geq frac{p_1}{sqrt{3}} ] Multiplying both sides by (frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}), we get: [ p geq frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} cdot p_1 ] 8. **Equality Condition:** Equality holds when ( ABCDEF ) is a regular hexagon, as all sides and angles are equal, making the midpoints form another regular hexagon.

After this, the second one for the first time looks at the drawing and determines from the remaining 99 points whether the erased point was lying on the marked semicircle. Prove that such a trick will not always succeed.","completion":"1. **Lemma Proof:** We start by proving the lemma: Let (A) be an infinite set, such that each subset of size (n) is colored in one of (k) colors. Then there is an infinite set (B subseteq A), such that each subset of size (n) is colored in the same color. - **Base Case ((n = 1)):** Each element of (A) is colored in one of (k) colors. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must occur infinitely many times. Thus, there exists an infinite subset (B subseteq A) where each element is the same color. - **Inductive Step:** Assume the lemma holds for (n-1). We need to show it holds for (n). For any (m), we want to find a subset (B subseteq A) with (|B| geq m) such that each subset of size (n) is colored the same. Let (C) be a large enough subset of (A). For each color (i) (where (i in {1, 2, ldots, k})), let (d_i = m). We will construct (B) iteratively. - Choose an element (a in C). By the inductive hypothesis, there exists an infinite subset of (C) such that each subset of size (n-1) containing (a) is colored the same. Let this subset be (C'). - Update (C := C'). If there exists a subset (B subseteq C) with (|B| = d_i - 1) such that each subset of size (n) is colored the same, we are done. Otherwise, set (d_i := d_i - 1) and repeat the process. - Continue this process until (d_i < n). When (d_i < n), there must be a subset of size (d_i) that meets the requirements, as it cannot have subsets of size (n). By induction, the lemma follows. 2. **Application to the Problem:** - Let the marked semicircle be red and the other semicircle be blue. Assume, for contradiction, that the magicians have a working strategy to determine if the erased point was on the marked semicircle. - Consider a configuration where all 100 points are in the blue semicircle. There are 99 points such that if the second magician sees them, they will answer \\"blue.\\" Let these points be (P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{99}). - If there is a point (Q) in the red semicircle and the configuration is (Q, P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{99}), the first magician will not delete (Q). For each such (Q), color it based on which point from the blue semicircle is deleted by the first magician. - Applying the lemma for (n = 1) and (k = 99), there exists an infinite set of points in the red semicircle such that for each point (Q) in it, in the configuration (Q, P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{99}), the same point (say (P_{99})) is deleted by the first magician. - Now, take two points (Q_1, Q_2) from this infinite set and (P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{98}). The first magician will delete a point in the blue semicircle. Repeat this process, applying the lemma for (n = x) and (k = 100 - x). - Eventually, there will be an infinite set of points in the red semicircle such that if the second magician sees any 99 of them, they will answer \\"blue.\\" However, if we take (Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_{100}) from this set and give them to the first magician, no matter which point is deleted, the second magician will answer \\"blue,\\" leading to a contradiction.

Erasing two identical signs and writing a plus. b. Erasing two different signs and writing a minus. 2. **Operation Analysis**: - If two identical signs (either two plus signs or two minus signs) are erased, a plus sign is written, which does not change the evenness of the number of minus signs. - If two different signs (a plus and a minus) are erased, a minus sign is written. In this operation, one minus sign is removed, but another one is added, keeping the evenness of the number of minus signs unchanged. 3. **Parity Consideration**: - The total number of minus signs initially is 15, which is an odd number. - According to the given operations, each step will either: a.

Step 1: Establish the relationship between overrightarrow{p} and overrightarrow{q} due to their parallelism. Since overrightarrow{p} parallel overrightarrow{q}, we have the proportionality condition: [ frac{a+c}{b+a} = frac{b}{c-a} ] Step 2: Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction and simplify the equation.

We need to determine the smallest value of alpha for this pyramid to be regular. 2. **Objective**: Prove that when alpha = 60^circ, the pyramid is regular, and construct a non-regular pyramid with alpha < 60^circ. 3. **Step-by-step Proof for alpha = 60^circ**: - Let's assume the sides of the equilateral triangle ABC are all equal to 1. - In any triangle where one angle is 60^circ, the side opposite to it is the average length of the other two sides. Therefore, in the triangle with the 60^circ angle, if one side length exceeds another, the third side will be strictly less than one but greater than the other. 4. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose one lateral edge of the pyramid, say SA, is not equal to 1 (i.e., SA > 1). - In the triangles SAB and SAC, the edges SB and SC would both be less than 1, which yields a contradiction as the edge BC in the base triangle SBC would not be the median length. 5. **Building a non-regular pyramid with alpha < 60^circ**: - A regular pyramid cannot have alpha < 60^circ because for smaller alpha: - Consider triangle SAB where SA = SB and the included angle alpha being acute compared to 60^circ. - Consequently, AB < SA and therefore BC in SBC will not maintain the median value. - Thus, no uniformity or equality in all triangular faces. 6. **Second Constructive Method**: - Construct a triangle SAB where SA = SB and angle S = alpha. Given AB < SB, place point C such that BC = AB. - By constructing a three-faced solid with alpha degrees everywhere in SABC, the structure remains inequitable in height and base-angle correspondences if alpha < 60^circ. 7. **Summarizing the results**: - For alpha = 60^circ, point S forms equilateral faces SAB, SBC, SAC, maintaining axial symmetry and uniformity. - For alpha < 60^circ, non-symmetric point projection defaults, making pyramid non-regular. **Conclusion**: The smallest value of alpha such that the pyramid SABC is regular is: [ boxed{60^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Among the following four equations, the one whose product is not equal to the others is ( ) A: 190 times 80 B: 19 times 800 C: 19 times 8 times 10 D: 19 times 8 times 100","completion":"Let's calculate each product: 190 times 80 = 15200 19 times 800 = 15200 19 times 8 times 10 = 1520 19 times 8 times 100 = 15200 Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"Given that S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, a_{1}=1, and a_{8}=3a_{3}, then dfrac{a_{2}}{S_{1}S_{2}}+ dfrac{a_{3}}{S_{2}S_{3}}+ dfrac{a_{4}}{S_{3}S_{4}}+ldots+ dfrac{a_{n+1}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= ______.","completion":"Solution: From a_{1}=1 and a_{8}=3a_{3}, we get a_{1}+7d=3(a_{1}+2d), which simplifies to 1+7d=3+6d, yielding d=2. dfrac{a_{n+1}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= dfrac{S_{n+1}-S_{n}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= dfrac{1}{S_{n}}- dfrac{1}{S_{n+1}}, thus dfrac{a_{2}}{S_{1}S_{2}}+ dfrac{a_{3}}{S_{2}S_{3}}+ dfrac{a_{4}}{S_{3}S_{4}}+ldots+ dfrac{a_{n+1}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= dfrac{1}{S_{1}}- dfrac{1}{S_{2}}+ dfrac{1}{S_{2}}- dfrac{1}{S_{3}}+ldots+ dfrac{1}{S_{n}}- dfrac{1}{S_{n+1}}= dfrac{1}{S_{1}}- dfrac{1}{S_{n+1}}=1- dfrac{1}{(n+1)+ dfrac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}times2} =1- dfrac{1}{(n+1)^{2}}, Therefore, the answer is: boxed{1- dfrac{1}{(n+1)^{2}}} By using the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence to find the common difference, and applying the method of splitting terms for the solution, we can solve this problem.

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Calculate the side length of the square lawn:** - The area of the square lawn is given as 400m^{2}. - The side length of a square is the square root of its area, so the side length is sqrt{400}m = 20m. 2. **Determine the perimeter of the square lawn:** - The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length, so the perimeter of the square lawn is 20m times 4 = 80m. 3. **Set up the equation for the perimeter of the rectangular field:** - Let the length and width of the rectangular field be 5x and 3x respectively, to maintain the 5:3 ratio. - The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of its length and width, so we have the equation (5x + 3x) times 2 = 80. 4. **Solve for x:** - Simplifying the equation, we get 16x = 80. - Solving for x, we find x = frac{80}{16} = 5. 5. **Calculate the dimensions of the rectangular field:** - The length of the rectangle is 5 times 5 = 25m. - The width of the rectangle is 3 times 5 = 15m. 6. **Calculate the area of the rectangular field:** - The area of the rectangle is 25m times 15m = 375m^{2}. 7. **Compare the area of the rectangular field with the required area:** - The calculated area of the rectangular field is 375m^{2}, which is greater than the required area of 300m^{2}. 8. **Conclusion:** - Since the area of the rectangular field that can be enclosed by the iron fence is greater than the required 300m^{2}, the iron fence is indeed enough to enclose the new rectangular field.

First, let's solve Equation 1 for x: x = 20 - y Now, we can substitute this expression for x into Equation 2: 45(20 - y) + 85y = 1100 Expanding the equation, we get: 900 - 45y + 85y = 1100 Combining like terms, we get: 40y = 1100 - 900 40y = 200 Now, divide both sides by 40 to solve for y: y = 200 / 40 y = 5 So, the second mechanic worked for boxed{5} hours."},{"prompt":"Let (a,) (b,) (c,) and (d) be positive real numbers such that (a + b + c + d = 3.)

Let us first calculate the total sum of all given numbers: [ 1 + 10 + 11 + 15 + 18 + 37 + 40 = 132 ] 3. Next, we need to evaluate the feasibility of having two lines with sum relations as described. Since one line's sum is three times that of another line, let us assume the smaller sum is (x). Therefore, the larger sum would be (3x). 4. We also know that the total sum of the numbers should be equal to these sums combined: [ x + 3x = 4x ] Therefore: [ 4x = 132 implies x = frac{132}{4} = 33 ] 5. Thus, one line must sum to (33) and the other must sum to (99) (which is (3 times 33)). 6. We now verify the feasibility with the given data. To ensure our construction, we look at numbers modulo 7.

Adding numbers that allow us to maintain the said property: - The total is formed when the sums modulo 7 are also preserved.

He bought 2 drinks at 4 each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 for the drinks. He bought 3 energy bars at 3 each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 for the energy bars before the discount. Let's calculate the discount on the energy bars: 20% of 9 is (20/100) * 9 = 1.80. Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost of the energy bars: 9 - 1.80 = 7.20 for the energy bars after the discount. Now, let's add up the cost of the drinks and the discounted energy bars: 8 + 7.20 = 15.20. Wade spent a total of 40.80, so the cost of the sandwiches is 40.80 - 15.20 = 25.60. Wade bought 1 sandwich to eat now and 2 sandwiches for the road, which is a total of 3 sandwiches. To find the cost of each sandwich, we divide the total cost of the sandwiches by the number of sandwiches: 25.60 / 3 = 8.53 (rounded to two decimal places). Therefore, each sandwich individually cost boxed{8.53} ."},{"prompt":"The four positive integers a, b, c, d in arithmetic progression satisfy [ a times b times c times d = 9!. ] Find the smallest possible value of a + b + c + d.","completion":"Let a, b, c, d be in arithmetic progression with common difference r.

The centroid divides each median of the triangle in a 2:1 ratio, measuring from the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. 1. **Calculate the centroid's effect on triangle proportions**: The centroid divides each median into segments with a ratio of 2:1. Thus, overline{FG}, which is parallel to overline{BC} and contains the centroid, also splits the triangle into smaller triangles whose areas are in the ratio 1:2. 2. **Use the area ratio to find the length of overline{FG}**: The area ratio between triangle ABC and the smaller triangle AFG is 1:2, and since overline{FG} parallel overline{BC}, the similar triangles principle gives that frac{FG}{BC} = frac{1}{2}. 3. **Calculate FG**: Given BC = 15, then FG = frac{1}{2} times BC = frac{1}{2} times 15 = frac{15}{2}.

Since A was in the business for the entire year, his investment can be considered for 12 months. B's investment, however, was only for (12 - x) months because he joined 'x' months after A started the business. The profit-sharing ratio is given as 2:1, which means A's share of the profit is twice that of B's share. This ratio should also be the same as the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were in the business.

This requires comparing: [ f(u + epsilon) = (u + epsilon)^4 ] with [ g(u) = u^4 + u^2 + u + 1 ] 4. **Expand ( f(u + epsilon) ):** [ f(u + epsilon) = (u + epsilon)^4 = u^4 + 4u^3epsilon + 6u^2epsilon^2 + 4uepsilon^3 + epsilon^4 ] 5. **Form the difference ( f(u + epsilon) - g(u) ):** [ f(u + epsilon) - g(u) = (u^4 + 4u^3epsilon + 6u^2epsilon^2 + 4uepsilon^3 + epsilon^4) - (u^4 + u^2 + u + 1) ] Simplify the expression: [ f(u + epsilon) - g(u) = 4u^3epsilon + 6u^2epsilon^2 + 4uepsilon^3 + epsilon^4 - u^2 - u - 1 ] 6. **Approximate for large ( u ):** For ( u ) large and considering (epsilon = frac{1}{100} ): begin{align*} f(u + epsilon) - g(u) & > 4u^3epsilon - u^2 - u - 1 & = 4u^3left(frac{1}{100}right) - u^2 - u - 1 & = frac{4u^3}{100} - u^2 - u - 1 & = 0.04u^3 - u^2 - u - 1 end{align*} The term ( 0.04u^3 ) will dominate for sufficiently large ( u ), hence, [ 0.04u^3 - u^2 - u - 1 > 0 quad text{for} quad u > 100 ] So, ( f(u + epsilon) > g(u) ) if ( u > 100 ). 7. **Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem:** - We have ( f(u) < g(u) < f(u + epsilon) ). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists some ( v ) in the interval ( (u, u + epsilon) ) such that: [ f(v) = g(u) ] 8. **Conclusion:** - Hence, the points ( A = (v, f(v)) ) and ( B = (u, g(u)) ) are less than (epsilon = frac{1}{100}) units apart as desired.

We need to find ( n ) integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) such that: - ( a_i geq 2 ) for all ( 1 leq i leq n ) - ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) are coprime for ( i neq j ) - The product ( a_1 a_2 cdots a_n - 1 ) is the product of two consecutive integers. 2. **Constructing the Integers**: We need a systematic way to construct such ( a_i )'s. Consider the following construction: - Define each ( a_i = p_i ), where ( p_i ) is the (i)-th prime number. - This choice ensures that ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) are coprime because any two distinct primes are always coprime (no common divisors other than 1). 3. **Verifying the Product Property**: - We need to show ( p_1 p_2 cdots p_n - 1 ) can be expressed as a product of two consecutive integers. - Let ( P = p_1 p_2 cdots p_n ). We need ( P - 1 = k(k+1) ) for some integer ( k ). - We use the fact that the product of consecutive integers is ( k(k+1) = k^2 + k ). 4. **Finding ( P )**: - Notice that ( P - 1 ) will be of the form ( p_1 p_2 cdots p_n - 1 ). For simplicity, let's illustrate with examples: - For ( n = 1 ): ( p_1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 ) (not valid since 1 is neither a product nor consecutive). - For ( n = 2 ): ( p_1 p_2 - 1 = 2 cdot 3 - 1 = 5) (not valid in our context). - For ( n = 3 ): ( p_1 p_2 p_3 - 1 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 - 1 = 29) (not valid as it’s not a product of two consecutive integers).

We set frac{y - 4}{x - 2} = k, so the equation becomes kx - y - 2k + 4 = 0. For this line to be tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle (1, 1) to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by the formula frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Substituting the values for our line and circle center, we get: frac{|k - 1 - 2k + 4|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. Solving for k, we first square both sides to remove the square root: (k - 1 - 2k + 4)^2 = (k^2 + 1). Simplifying and solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find the possible values of k. However, since we are only interested in the minimum value of frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, we will examine the distance formula closely: frac{|-k + 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. To find the minimum k, we minimize -k + 3 (since we are looking for the minimum of this value over the positive radius). So, we want the smallest k such that |-k + 3| = sqrt{k^2 + 1}. Since k is in a denominator and we want to minimize frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, we want the largest negative k (which will give the smallest positive value when in the denominator). From the distance formula, we see that k must be negative because the absolute value function and the square root will both yield positive results, and have to balance each other out. Hence we focus on the case -k + 3 = sqrt{k^2 + 1}. Upon solving, we find k = -frac{4}{3}. However, we were looking for the minimum value of frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, which corresponds to the maximum value of k due to the negative sign in frac{-1}{k}.

The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac.

Corresponding points of division on opposite sides are connected with each other, and the resulting cells are colored in a checkerboard pattern. Prove that the sum of the areas of the black cells is equal to the sum of the areas of the white cells.","completion":": 1. **Introduction of Points and Parallelogram**: Let (M, N, K, L) be the midpoints of the sides (AB, BC, CD), and (AD) of a convex quadrilateral (ABCD), respectively. By connecting midpoints of adjacent sides, we form the quadrilateral (MNKL), which is known to be a parallelogram by the Midpoint Theorem. 2. **Parallelogram Properties**: Since (MNKL) is a parallelogram, its diagonals (MK) and (NL) will bisect each other. Let (Q) be the intersection point of these diagonals. Thus, (Q) divides both (MK) and (NL) into two equal segments. 3. **General Formula for Division**: By the given problem, each of the segments connecting corresponding division points on opposite sides of the convex quadrilateral (ABCD) is divided into 8 equal parts. This forms (4 times 8 = 32) small triangles (as each side of the quadrilateral is divided into 8 segments and each pair of opposite sides form a grid structure). 4. **Summation of Areas**: The crux of the problem is to show that the total area of black cells is equal to the total area of white cells in a checkerboard pattern. By considering the parallelogram (MNKL) and its properties: - Any two adjacent triangular sections share a common vertex and their bases lie on parallel lines (as both are part of the same parallelogram). - Each triangle formed inside the parallelogram with a common vertex (Q) has its equivalent triangle with shared bases on the sides of the convex quadrilateral, thereby maintaining equal areas due to congruent bases and heights. 5. **Conclusion**: The above reasoning showcases parity in the areas formed by the intersection points and subdivisions of the convex quadrilateral sides. Given the symmetric properties and equal divisions by midpoints and intersection points, it logically follows that the checkerboard pattern's area, summed over black and white cells, results in equal total areas for each color. Thus, the sum of the areas of black cells is equal to the sum of the areas of white cells.

Half of the 20 pictures were drawn on the back of the sheets, so the other half, which is 20 / 2 = 10 pictures, were drawn on the front of the sheets.

The hotel manager chooses one room and relocates all its occupants to another single room.

Let's assume that when there are 8824 guests, the director is always able to free up a room. 1. **Pairing the Rooms**: First, we pair the rooms by their capacities as follows: [ (101, 200), (102, 199), ldots, (150, 151) ] Here, each pair has a combined capacity that is greater than what can be contained in either of the rooms alone. 2. **Summing Up Capacities**: For each pair ((a, b)), both rooms' capacities add up to more than what the larger room can hold. Thus, if any of these pairs have a combined population less than or equal to the greater room's capacity, we can move all guests of the pair into the larger room. Considering the worst-case scenario where this pair formation leads to no room becoming available, we need to calculate the most people that can be accommodated without freeing a room via this strategy. 3. **Using Sum Calculations**: The smallest capacity in these pairs is (101), and the largest is (200). Summing these capacities from 101 to 200: [ 101 + 200, 102 + 199, ldots, 150 + 151 ] The sum of this arithmetic series (each half-pair summed) is: [ (200 + 101) + (199 + 102) + cdots + (151 + 150) ] This is a sum of 50 terms, each term giving us a sum of 301. Hence, we get: [ 301 times 50 = 15050 ] However, we reconsider as the limits reframe as 101 to 150 and 151 to 200: Sum for room pairs: [ sum_{k=101}^{150} k quad text{and} quad sum_{k=151}^{200} k ] This is calculated using the formula for sum of first n integers: [ S = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Thus: [ sum_{k=101}^{150} k = frac{150 times 151}{2} - frac{100 times 101}{2} ] Which gives: [ S_1 = frac{150 times 151}{2} = 11325 quad text{and} quad S_2 = frac{100 times 101}{2} = 5050 ] So: [ 11325 - 5050 = 6275 quad text{similarly for higher 151 to 200 gives we calculate} ] And for the upper half: [ sum_{k=151}^{200} k ] Concluding the overall calculations: Summing the two partitions restricted ensures the number 8825 thus maximum possible to always clear is (8824). 4. **Concluding the Quantity Max Bound Solution**: At ( n=8824 ) always capable, however arranging non-reclaimable which overgap ( past 8825 ) [ boxed{8824} ]"},{"prompt":"Geoff and Trevor each roll a fair eightsided die (faces numbered from 1 to 8).

Also, the hypotenuse EF is DFsqrt{2} = 8sqrt{2}. We compute the area of triangle DEF. The formula for the area of a triangle is (text{Area} = frac{1}{2}times text{base} times text{height}).

We need to find the intersection of this line with the parabola in the first quadrant: Given the system of equations: begin{cases} y^2 = 16x x = 2 end{cases}, we can substitute x=2 into the first equation to find that y^2 = 32. Since we are looking for the point in the first quadrant, we take the positive square root to get y=4sqrt{2}. Thus, the center C of the circle is at (2, 4sqrt{2}). The radius r of the circle is equal to the distance from the center C to the focus F, which is |CF|. To find this distance, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: r^2 = (2-4)^2 + (4sqrt{2}-0)^2 = (-2)^2 + (4sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 32 = 36. Hence, the radius of the circle is r = sqrt{36} = 6.

The largest number among the given values is (21). It cannot correspond to the number of boys in a single class since the corresponding total number of students would be unaccounted for in the list.

Using the property of exterior angles, we find Angle B as follows: [ text{Angle B} + 70° = 110° implies text{Angle B} = 40° ] 7. **Another Possibility**: If Angle B = Angle C, then using the equation from step 2, we can find that each of them could be 55° to make the sum 110°, which also makes ABC an isosceles triangle. 8. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Angle B can be 70° if Angle A = Angle B, 40° if Angle A = Angle C and Angle B = Angle C, or 55° if Angle B = Angle C.

Now, consider the angles: [ angle EBD = angle ABD = pi - 2angle BAD ] [ angle ECD = angle ACE = pi - 2angle EAC ] Since ( angle BAD = angle EAC ), we have: [ angle EBD = angle ECD ] This implies that ( BEDC ) is a cyclic quadrilateral because opposite angles are supplementary. 3. **Establishing Cyclic Quadrilateral ( BECA' ):** Next, we need to show that quadrilateral ( BECA' ) is cyclic. - Since ( A' ) is the reflection of ( A ) across ( BC ), ( angle BA'C = angle BAC ). - We already have ( angle BAC = angle EAC ). Therefore: [ angle BA'C = angle AEC ] This implies that ( BECA' ) is a cyclic quadrilateral. 4. **Combining Results:** Since both ( BEDC ) and ( BECA' ) are cyclic, we can conclude that ( A'BEDC ) is a cyclic pentagon. 5. **Congruence of Triangles:** Since ( triangle ABC cong triangle A'BC ), the circumcircles of ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle A'BC ) are congruent and have the same radius. 6. **Conclusion:** Since ( A'BEDC ) is cyclic and ( triangle ABC cong triangle A'BC ), the circumcircles of ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle A'DE ) have the same radii.

Since the areas of the triangles ( triangle ABP ), ( triangle BCP ), and ( triangle ACP ) need to be equal, each of these areas must be: [ text{Area}(triangle ABP) = text{Area}(triangle BCP) = text{Area}(triangle ACP) = frac{1}{3} Delta ] 3. **Relationship with Distances**: Let’s consider the given areas geometrically. The area of a triangle formed by a point inside the triangle and a fixed base is proportional to the height of the triangle from that point to the base. 4. **Conditions from Equal Areas**: a. **For ( triangle ABP ) and ( triangle BCP )**: If areas are equal, the distances from points ( A ) and ( C ) to line segment ( BP ) must be equal. This implies that the line ( BP ) either passes through the midpoint of ( AC ) or is parallel to it. b. The same argument applies for ( triangle ACP ) and ( triangle ABP ): the distances from points ( B ) and ( C ) to line segment ( AP ) must be equal. 5. **Key Geometric Insight**: The point ( P ) must lie on the lines that equally divide the triangle ( triangle ABC ) into three smaller triangles of equal area. This condition is satisfied when ( P ) lies on any of the medians of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). 6. **Intersection Point**: The medians of a triangle intersect at a single point, known as the centroid ( G ). By definition, the centroid ( G ) is the point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio (with the longer segment being closer to the vertex). 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, the point ( P ) that satisfies the condition such that ( text{Area}(triangle ABP) = text{Area}(triangle BCP) = text{Area}(triangle ACP) ) is the centroid ( G ) of the triangle ( triangle ABC ).

To have an odd sum with a selection of four numbers, there must be either **one odd number and three even numbers** or **three odd numbers and one even number** in the combination, since an odd number of odd numbers always sums to an odd number. 1. One odd number can be selected from the five available in C_5^1 ways and three even numbers can be selected from the four available in C_4^3 ways.

Given a_1 = frac{1}{4} and a_1 + b_1 = 1, we find that b_1 = frac{3}{4}. Then, using b_{n+1} = frac{1}{2 - b_n} recursively, we have: b_2 = frac{1}{2 - b_1} = frac{1}{2 - frac{3}{4}} = frac{4}{5}, b_3 = frac{1}{2 - b_2} = frac{1}{2 - frac{4}{5}} = frac{5}{6}. Thus, we obtain that b_1 = frac{3}{4}, b_2 = frac{4}{5}, and b_3 = frac{5}{6}. (2) From part (1), we have b_{n+1} = frac{1}{2 - b_n}. Therefore, we can write: b_{n+1} - 1 = frac{1}{2 - b_n} - 1 = frac{b_n - 1}{2 - b_n}, and hence, frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 1} = frac{2 - b_n}{b_n - 1} = -1 + frac{1}{b_n - 1}. This leads to: frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 1} - frac{1}{b_n - 1} = -1. Knowing b_1 = frac{3}{4}, we have frac{1}{b_1 - 1} = -4. Thus, the sequence left{ frac{1}{b_n - 1} right} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term -4 and common difference -1. Therefore, its general term is: frac{1}{b_n - 1} = -4 - (n - 1) = -n - 3. From this, we can deduce the general formula for {b_n}: b_n = 1 - frac{1}{n + 3} = frac{n + 2}{n + 3}. Thus, we have boxed{b_n = frac{n + 2}{n + 3}}. (3) Since a_n + b_n = 1, we can express a_n in terms of b_n: a_n = 1 - b_n = frac{1}{n + 3}, and therefore: a_na_{n+1} = frac{1}{(n + 3)(n + 4)} = frac{1}{n + 3} - frac{1}{n + 4}. To find S_n, we sum the series: S_n = frac{1}{4 cdot 5} + frac{1}{5 cdot 6} + ldots + frac{1}{(n + 3)(n + 4)} = left( frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{5} right) + left( frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} right) + ldots + left( frac{1}{n + 3} - frac{1}{n + 4} right) = frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{n + 4} = frac{n}{4(n + 4)}.

(i) If a = 1, f(n) = -3n - 8 < 0 always holds, so a = 1 is a valid solution. (ii) If a > 1, f(n) has a positive leading coefficient, implying the parabola opens upwards.

Given that the average yield per mu of rice is 100 kg higher than that of corn, the average yield per mu of corn can be represented as (x - 100) kg. The total income from selling rice and corn can be calculated by multiplying the yield per mu by the number of mu planted and the selling price per kg. Therefore, the equation representing the total income is: [3 times 200x + 2.5 times 100(x - 100) = 400,000] Simplifying this equation: [600x + 250x - 25,000 = 400,000] [850x = 425,000] [x = 500] Thus, the average yield per mu of rice is 500 kg, and for corn, it is 500 - 100 = 400 kg.

Length of the first train = 121 meters = 0.121 km Length of the second train = 153 meters = 0.153 km Total length to be covered for the trains to be clear of each other = 0.121 km + 0.153 km = 0.274 km Time taken to clear each other = 6.802214443534172 seconds Convert this time to hours: 6.802214443534172 seconds = 6.802214443534172 / 3600 hours (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, let's calculate the relative speed using the formula: Relative Speed = Total Distance / Time Relative Speed = 0.274 km / (6.802214443534172 / 3600 hours) Relative Speed = 0.274 km / (0.001889503456537825 hours) Relative Speed = 0.274 km / 0.001889503456537825 hours Relative Speed ≈ 145.007 kmph We know that the second train is running at 65 kmph, and the relative speed is the sum of the speeds of both trains. Let's denote the speed of the first train as S1. Relative Speed = Speed of first train (S1) + Speed of second train 145.007 kmph = S1 + 65 kmph S1 = 145.007 kmph - 65 kmph S1 ≈ 80.007 kmph Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately boxed{80.007} kmph."},{"prompt":"the geometric sequence {a_n} where all terms are positive, a_2, frac{1}{2}a_3, and a_1 form an arithmetic sequence.

If the retailer made a profit equivalent to 20% of the final selling price after all deductions and taxes, what is the retail price R of the machine before any discounts or taxes were applied?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find the original wholesale cost before the 5% tax and the 10 shipping fee. Let's call this original wholesale cost W. The retailer bought the machine for 90, which includes the 5% tax and the 10 shipping fee. So we can write the following equation: W + 0.05W + 10 = 90 Combining like terms, we get: 1.05W + 10 = 90 Now, we need to subtract the 10 shipping fee to solve for W: 1.05W = 90 - 10 1.05W = 80 Now, divide by 1.05 to find W: W = 80 / 1.05 W = 76.19 (rounded to two decimal places) Now, let's find the retail price R before any discounts or taxes. We know that the retailer made a profit equivalent to 20% of the final selling price after all deductions and taxes. Let's call the final selling price F. The retailer sold the machine with a 10% discount on the retail price R, so the selling price before tax is: F = R - 0.10R F = 0.90R Then, a 15% sales tax is applied to F, so the final selling price after tax is: F + 0.15F = 1.15F The profit made by the retailer is 20% of this final selling price, so: Profit = 0.20 * 1.15F We know that the profit is also the difference between the final selling price after tax and the original wholesale cost (including the 5% tax and 10 shipping fee), so: Profit = 1.15F - 90 Now, we can set the two expressions for profit equal to each other: 0.20 * 1.15F = 1.15F - 90 0.20 * 1.15F = 1.15F - 90 0.23F = 1.15F - 90 Now, we need to solve for F: 0.23F = 1.15F - 90 Subtract 1.15F from both sides: 0.23F - 1.15F = -90 -0.92F = -90 Now, divide by -0.92 to find F: F = -90 / -0.92 F = 97.83 (rounded to two decimal places) Now, we know that F = 0.90R, so we can solve for R: 97.83 = 0.90R R = 97.83 / 0.90 R = 108.70 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the retail price R of the machine before any discounts or taxes were applied is approximately boxed{108.70} ."},{"prompt":"Rationalize the denominator of displaystylefrac{8}{sqrt{8}} and then divide the result by 2.","completion":"To rationalize the denominator: dfrac{8}{sqrt{8}} = dfrac{8}{sqrt{8}} cdot dfrac{sqrt{8}}{sqrt{8}} = dfrac{8 sqrt{8}}{8} = sqrt{8}.

Prove that the number of ways in which an (m times n) rectangle can be partitioned into dominoes of type ((a, b)) is even.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem and setup:** We need to prove that the number of ways an m times n rectangle can be partitioned into dominoes of type (a, b) is even, given that 0 < a leq b and 4 nmid mn (i.e., mn is not divisible by 4). 2. **Number of dominoes:** First, we note that each domino of type (a, b) covers exactly ab unit squares. Therefore, the total number of dominoes required to partition an m times n rectangle is given by: [ text{Number of dominoes} = frac{m times n}{a times b} ] Since a, b geq 1 and _m times n} is not divisible by 4, (frac{m times n}{a times b}) must be an odd number. This follows since if mn were even, and ab is even (which it must be because the product ab of two integers is always non-zero), (frac{m times n}{a times b}) would be odd or even. 3. **Reflection argument:** Now consider the reflection of the partitioned rectangle over one axis. Let's denote this reflection as P'. The reflection P' gives another partition of the rectangle into dominoes of type (a, b). We argue that P' cannot be the same as P. 4. **If the reflection were identical:** Suppose P' = P, then each domino in P would pair with its image in P'. If each domino pairs with another, and we have an odd number of dominoes, one must remain unpaired. This would mean one domino must reflect into itself. 5. **Self-reflecting domino:** For a domino to reflect into itself, it must lie exactly on the line of symmetry. However, since a > 0, it cannot hold since each domino spans at least 1 unit horizontally or vertically, and hence cannot be symmetric. 6. **Conclusion on pairing and evenness:** Since we cannot have a reflection that results in the same partition, every partition must be distinct from its reflected partition, creating pairs of partitions. Therefore, each partition pairs with exactly one distinct reflection, leading to an even number of possible partitions. # Conclusion: The number of ways an m times n rectangle can be partitioned into dominoes of type (a, b) is even.

We start by noting that K lies on line BC and AB = KB. This result indicates that point K is the reflection of A across the bisector of BC. 2. Connect AF. Because F is on the arc BC not containing A in the circumcircle, AF passes through I. Furthermore, we know FB = FI because F lies on the angle bisector of BIC. 3. Since M is the midpoint of BI, it follows that FM perp BI. This orthogonal relationship implies that the points B, M, E, and F are concyclic. Thus, the quadrilateral BMFE is cyclic. 4. Consequently, we have angle MFE = angle EBI and angle FME = angle FBC implying angle ABI = angle FAC = angle BAI. Hence, triangles triangle MFE sim triangle ABI by AA similarity criterion. 5. Since N and M are midpoints of EF and BI respectively, triangles triangle MFN sim triangle ABM by the Midline Theorem because the midpoint of the altitude transfers triangle similarity. 6. Thus, we derive that angle FMN = angle BAM. 7. Next, focus on the angle sum at D. We observe: [ begin{aligned} angle DMA + angle DKA &= (angle FMA - angle FMN) + angle BAK &= (angle FMA - angle BAM) + (angle BAM + angle MAK) &= angle FMA + angle MAK end{aligned} ] 8. Because FM perp BI and AK perp BI, it follows that FM perp AK. Therefore, the sum of these angles is 180^circ: [ angle FMA + angle MAK = 180^circ ] 9.

The relationship is: LCM(n, 10) * GCF(n, 10) = n * 10 Substituting the given values, we get: 36 * 5 = n * 10 Now, we can solve for n: 180 = n * 10 n = 180 / 10 n = 18 Therefore, the number n is boxed{18} ."},{"prompt":"Prove that if the tetrahedron (ABCD) has equal edges (i.e., opposite edges have equal lengths), then the foot of the altitude from (D) lies on the Euler line of triangle (ABC).","completion":"# Detailed Solution: The problem statement requires us to prove that if tetrahedron ABCD is equilateral (i.e., opposite edges are of equal length), then the foot of the altitude from vertex D to the plane ABC lies on the Euler line of triangle ABC. To prove this, we will utilize geometric properties of tetrahedra and triangles, as well as the properties of the centroid and circumcenter of a triangle. Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Centers Coincidence**: - In an equilateral tetrahedron, the centroid ( S ) acts as both the centroid and the circumcenter. - Let ( S ) be the centroid (or circumcenter) of tetrahedron (ABCD). 2. **Relevant Points in the Cube**: - Consider the cube formed by drawing the lines extending through the tetrahedron, denoted as (AB_1CD_1) and (A_1BC_1D) (see fig.1 in initial solution description). - For the rectangular parallelopiped (or cuboid), the geometric centroid ( K ) coincides with the circumcenter as ( A, B, C, D ) lie on the circumsphere. 3. **Projection of the Centroid**: - Let ( S_0 ) denote the centroid (or barycenter) of triangle ( ABC ). - In a regular tetrahedron, ( S ) lies on the line connecting ( D ) and ( S_0 ) such that ( S ) divides the segment ( DS_0 ) in the ratio 3:1 (towards ( S_0 )). - Let's denote the perpendicular projection of ( K ) onto the plane (ABC) by ( K_0 ). 4. **Right Triangles**: - Analyze the right triangles ( AK_0K ), ( BK_0K ), and ( CK_0K ). Since they share the same hypotenuse ( K_0K ) and one leg originating from equal radii of the circumsphere, ( K_0A = K_0B = K_0C ). - Therefore, ( K_0 ) is equidistant from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), positioning it as the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Scaling Transformation**: - A known geometric transformation involves scaling the centroid of a triangle to form another geometric figure. Applying a scaling transformation centered at ( S_0 ) with a factor of 4: - This transformation maps ( S ) to ( D ), since ( S ) is one-fourth of ( DS_0 ). - Consequently, it maps ( K_0 ) to ( D_0 ) ( (D_0 ) being the perpendicular projection of ( D )). 6. **Concluding the Euler Line Alignment**: - From the transformation, the projection ( D_0 ) of ( D ) aligns with the Euler line of ( triangle ABC ). - The Euler line passes through the centroid ( S_0 ), circumcenter ( K_0 ), orthocenter, and other key points associated with ( triangle ABC ). Hence, the foot of the altitude from ( D ) to the plane ( ABC ) lies on the Euler line of ( triangle ABC ). Therefore, the geometric alignments and transformations validate the required proof.

For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eightdigit integers of this form?","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the process into detailed steps: 1. **Identify the Form of the Eight-Digit Integer**: An eight-digit integer formed by repeating a four-digit integer n can be represented as 10^4n + n. This is because the first n occupies the first four digits, and to make space for the second n, we multiply the first n by 10^4 (which shifts it four places to the left) and then add the second n. 2. **Simplify the Expression**: The expression 10^4n + n can be simplified by factoring out n, which gives us n(10^4 + 1) = 10001n. This shows that any eight-digit number of this form is a multiple of 10001. 3. **Determine the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: To find the GCD of all such eight-digit numbers, we look at the factor they all share, which is 10001. To confirm that 10001 is indeed the greatest common divisor, we can consider two consecutive multiples of 10001, such as 10001 times 1000 and 10001 times 1001. 4. **Analyze the Consecutive Multiples**: The consecutive multiples 10001 times 1000 and 10001 times 1001 share 10001 as a common factor. After dividing both numbers by 10001, we are left with 1000 and 1001, which are consecutive integers and therefore share no common divisors other than 1. 5. **Conclude the GCD**: Since the only common factor between any two such eight-digit numbers (formed by repeating a four-digit number) is 10001, and considering that consecutive multiples of 10001 (after dividing out 10001) share no nontrivial factors, we conclude that the greatest common divisor of all such eight-digit numbers is boxed{10001}."},{"prompt":"There are 11 white rabbits and 13 black rabbits.

Since the sum of distances from any point on an ellipse to its two foci is constant, and here it is given as 10, we identify that the given equation describes an ellipse.

This property can be observed more easily if we begin with one of the faces as an equilateral triangle. **Step 3: Utilize the congruence of triangles.** Assume a tetrahedron (ABCD) with (BC=a), (CA=b), and (AB=c). If (b neq c), triangles (BCA) and (BCD), which share the common edge (BC), can only be congruent if the distances of points (A) and (D) from (BC) are equal. Thus, either (DB = AC) or (DA = AC). **Step 4: Prove the consistency of this property with all faces.** Given (DB=AC): 1. Assume (A in D). Then, for triangles (ADC) to be congruent to (ADB), they must have equal sides: (DC=DB) which contradicts the non-equality of sides unless (D = B) or (D = A). 2. Thus, it must hold that (DA = AC). **Step 5: Define the centroid and demonstrate the concurrency of median lines.** Define a median of a tetrahedron as a line segment connecting a vertex with the centroid of the opposite face. To show that the medians intersect at a single point, consider (BC) as a common edge of two faces: - Let the centroids of faces (BCA) and (BCD) be (S_{A}) and (S_{D}). - Thus, the medians (AS_A) and (DS_D) must intersect in a plane (ADF) including the midpoint (F) of edge (BC). **Step 6: Establish similarity and colinearity.** In the plane (ADF), both (S_A) and (S_D) are on medians that pass through (F). The triangles (FS_DS_A) are similar to (FAD) with a scaling factor of 1:3, leading to: [AD = 3 cdot S_DS_A, quad S_DS_A parallel AD] This makes the quadrilateral (AS_DS_AD) a trapezoid. **Step 7: Using the trapezoid property in tetrahedron geometry.** Considering the trapezoid formed by the centroids and adjoining median lines, the precious property of tetrahedrons states: [SS_A:SA = SS_D:SD = S_{A}S_D:AD = 1:3] Since each median line of a tetrahedron is divided into segments with a 1:3 ratio, any two of these medians intersect in such a way that other medians pass through the same intersection point. **Step 8: Circumcenter and centroid coincide.** Given that tetrahedron (ABCD) with congruent faces has equal medians intersecting at a point (S), where: [SA = SB = SC = SD] This point (S) must coincide with the centroid and circumcenter, implying (S) is equidistant from all tetrahedron vertices. Therefore, the claim is demonstrated. Hence, given any tetrahedron with congruent face triangles will have its centroid coincide with the center of its circumscribing sphere. The proof is complete.

Proof 1: Using Rearrangement Inequality 1. Assume (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}) are arranged such that (b_{1} leq b_{2} leq cdots leq b_{n}), where ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n}) is a permutation of ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}). 2. We know (b_{k} geq k) for (k=1, 2, ldots, n) since each (b_{i}) is distinct and positive. 3. Observe that (frac{1}{k^{2}}) is a decreasing sequence: (frac{1}{1^2} geq frac{1}{2^2} geq cdots geq frac{1}{k^2}). 4. By the Rearrangement Inequality: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{b_{k}}{k^{2}} geq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{k}{k^{2}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] 5.

Therefore: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} geq frac{left(sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}right)^{2}}{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] Proof 3: Using Abel's Transformation 1. Define (A_{k} = a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k}) and (B_{k} = 1 + 2 + cdots + k = frac{k(k+1)}{2}). 2. Since (a_{i}) are distinct, thus (A_{k} geq B_{k}) for all (k). 3. Applying Abel's Transformation, for partial sums, gives: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} left(frac{A_{k}}{k^2} - frac{A_{k}}{(k+1)^2}right) + frac{A_{n}}{n^2} ] 4.

Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form: [ left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{sqrt{a_{k}}}{k} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{a_{k}}} right)^2 leq left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} right) left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{k}} right) ] 2. Observing that: [ left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{sqrt{a_{k}}}{k} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{a_{k}}} right)^2 = left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} right)^2 ] 3. Given (sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{k}} leq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}), then: [ left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} right)^2 leq left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} right) left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} right) ] 4.

Recognizing this as a quadratic in form in terms of q^3, let's set x = q^3: x^2 = 16x - 64. Moving everything to one side: x^2 - 16x + 64 = 0. Factor the quadratic equation: (x - 8)^2 = 0. Therefore, x = 8 and since x = q^3, we have: q^3 = 8. Taking the cube root: q = sqrt[3]{8} = 2. Having found the common ratio q, we can now determine the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence, S_{10}, using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series: S_n = a_1frac{1 - q^n}{1 - q}, For n = 10: S_{10} = frac{1}{4}frac{1 - 2^{10}}{1 - 2}. Now to compute the sum: S_{10} = frac{1}{4}frac{1 - 1024}{1 - 2} = frac{1}{4}frac{-1023}{-1} = frac{1023}{4}. Hence, the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence S_{10} is boxed{frac{1023}{4}}."},{"prompt":"a rectangle, isosceles triangles with a given angle alpha at the vertex opposite the base are inscribed so that this vertex lies on a segment, and the ends of the base lie on other segments.

Denote the vertices of the rectangle as A, B, C, and D with A and B on one side and C and D on the opposite side. 3. Inscribe an isosceles triangle Delta PQR such that P is the vertex opposite the base QR, and QR lies on the side AB of the rectangle. Let M be the midpoint of QR. 4. Since QR is parallel to and congruent with AB, we know that M is the midpoint of QR as well as the midpoint of a line segment parallel to AB. 5. Note that in an isosceles triangle, the median from the vertex angle (here, angle P) to the base (QR) is also an altitude and an angle bisector. Therefore, the line segment PM is the median, altitude, and bisector of Delta PQR. 6. Additionally, because AB and CD are parallel, the line PM intersects the midpoint of AB (say N) and the rectangle’s top line parallel to AB at another midpoint (say O). 7. Therefore, the isosceles triangles inscribed in the rectangle with vertex P lying on the top or bottom segments must have their medians intersecting the midpoints of these segments, textit{regardless of the placement of the triangle} in the rectangle. 8. By the properties of isosceles triangles and symmetry in rectangle geometry, it follows that line PM of any such triangle will always intersect at the same point N. Conclusion: The midpoints of the bases of all such isosceles triangles coincide. This can be shown with symmetry and congruent properties of medians and bisectors intersecting at the rectangle’s middle points.

The robot can move to a neighboring cell by spending energy equal to the energy consumption of that cell. 2.

Break down the grid into manageable parts: - Assume there are several possible paths for the robot to take from its starting position. - Each path needs to be assessed to ensure that the total energy consumed does not exceed 59. 4. Consider the worst-case energy consumption scenario: To determine if there is at least one path where the total energy consumption is feasible.

Total energy consumption calculation (provided): [ 3 times 88 + 2 times 10 + 2 times 5 = 264 + 20 + 10 = 294 ] Here, (3 times 88) is derived from traversing through three individual 5 times 5 subgrids, (2 times 10) results from moving through two cells twice within certain paths, and (2 times 5) encompasses movements through two more cells twice. 7. Compare energy consumption with available energy: [ 294 < 5 times 59 ] Since this comparison shows that 294 units of energy consumption is less than 5 times the robot's initial energy budget (although the problem should be rephrased correctly to check for individual path ensuring the robot's movement is within constraints effectively): 8. Conclusion: Based on these calculations, moving the robot such that its total energy consumption along the paths is observed can confirm that at least one of these routes ensures the energy used does not surpass the available initial energy of the robot.

Ensure there is at least one such n.","completion":"The equation can be rewritten in form n^2 - 45n = n(n - 45). Since one of n, n-45 will be even, n^2 - 45n is even, making n^2 - 45n + 396 also even. Thus, the prime q is again 2. We now look for the product of the positive integral solutions to n^2 - 45n + 396 = 2, which simplifies to n^2 - 45n + 394 = 0. Solving the quadratic equation n^2 - 45n + 394 = 0, we find the roots using the quadratic formula: n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} with a = 1, b = -45, c = 394. So, n = frac{45 pm sqrt{(-45)^2 - 4 times 1 times 394}}{2 times 1} = frac{45 pm sqrt{2025 - 1576}}{2} = frac{45 pm sqrt{449}}{2}.

Points (E) and (D) are on segments (AB) and (BL) respectively such that (DL = LC) and (ED parallel AC). We need to find the length of segment (ED) given (AE = 15) and (AC = 12). 1. **Step 1: Identify Symmetries and Parallelograms** First, let's mark a point (X) on the line extended from (AL) such that (XL = LA). We note that in the quadrilateral (ACXD), the diagonals (AC) and (DX) intersect at (L) and the segments connecting these intersections are divided equally, i.e., (DL = LC). Thus, the diagonals bisect each other. 2. **Step 2: Confirm Parallelogram** Since (DL = LC) and (XL = LA), quadrilateral (ACXD) is a parallelogram. It means opposite sides are parallel, giving us (AX = DC) and (AC = DX). Because of the property of parallelograms, (DX parallel AC). 3. **Step 3: Utilize Given Parallels** The problem states (ED parallel AC). Thus, (E, D,) and (X) lie on the same straight line because they are all parallel to (AC). 4. **Step 4: Calculate (EX)** Since (ED parallel AC) and (E, D, X) are collinear, triangle (AEX) is an isosceles triangle with (EA = EX). The triangle configuration gives: (angle EAX = angle CAX = angle AXE). Thus, the lengths (AE = EX). 5. **Step 5: Determine (ED)** Using the length (EX = AE) and knowing (DX = AC): [ EX = 15 quad text{(as } AE = 15) ] [ DX = AC = 12 ] Since (EX = 15) and (DX = 12): [ ED = EX - DX = 15 - 12 = 3 ] 6. **Conclusion** The length of segment (ED) is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the matrix A= begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 0 & frac {1}{2} end{bmatrix}, then the inverse matrix of A is ______.","completion":"Since the determinant of matrix A is begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 0 & frac {1}{2} end{vmatrix} = frac {1}{2}, therefore, A^{-1} = begin{bmatrix} frac { frac {1}{2}}{ frac {1}{2}} & 0 0 & frac {1}{ frac {1}{2}} end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 0 & 2 end{bmatrix}.

Let's denote these colors as Color A and Color B. - Place the checkers of Color A on the white squares of the chessboard. - Place the checkers of Color B on the black squares of the chessboard. By doing this, in each 2 times 1 rectangle (i.e., in each adjacent pair of squares where one is white and the other is black), the checkers will always be of different colors. 2. **Case 2: Exactly Three Colors** Suppose we have three colors, say Color A, Color B, and Color C. The maximum number of checkers in any color cannot exceed 32 (since 32 + 32 = 64, and the total is 64 checkers). Without loss of generality, assume: - Color A has the most checkers (let's say 32). - Color B has the second-highest number of checkers. - Color C has the fewest checkers. - Place the checkers of Color A on the white squares, starting from the top of the board and filling each row horizontally. - Place the checkers of Color B on the black squares, starting from the bottom of the board and filling each row horizontally. Define a row as \\"full\\" if it contains 4 checkers from the same color group (Color A or Color B). Since Color A has at most 32 checkers and fills white squares from the top, the top rows will be filled predominantly with Color A checkers. Similarly, the bottom rows will be filled predominantly with Color B checkers. - Color C checkers are then to be placed in the remaining squares, ensuring they do not substitute a checker from Color A or B already placed. Since there are at most 32 checkers of any color and all squares will be occupied complying with the rule, this arrangement ensures checkers in each 2 times 1 rectangle are of different colors. 3. **Case 3: More than Three Colors** When more than three colors are present, combine the smallest groups of colors until we reduce the problem back to the three-color case. Specifically: - Combine two of the smallest color checkers groups. The resulting group counts will not exceed the limit of 32 checkers per color because combining two groups with fewer checkers will still result in fewer than or equal to 32 checkers. Repeat this process of combining groups until exactly three groups remain. - Then, apply the same procedure as Case 2 to place the checkers on the board. **Conclusion:** Following these procedures allows us to distribute the checkers such that no 2 times 1 rectangle contains checkers of the same color. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"When 0.4 of the total rope was used, the remaining length was 0.69 m (m).

Thus, we can infer: [ C_{max} leq frac{n+1}{2} ] 2. **Proof by Induction**: We will use mathematical induction to prove that ( C_{max} = frac{n+1}{2} ). **Base Case**: When ( n = 1 ), we need to show that ( C_{max} = 1 ). Consider splitting any set into groups each containing only one integer, each integer being greater than 1. The sum of reciprocals in each group is less than 1: [ frac{1}{a_i} < 1 ] Hence, ( C_{max} = 1 = frac{1 + 1}{2} ). The base case holds. **Inductive Step**: Assume for ( n = k ), ( C_{max} = frac{k + 1}{2} ). We need to prove this for ( n = k + 1 ). Suppose there is a set of integers ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m} ) such that: [ sum_{i=1}^{m} frac{1}{a_i} < frac{k + 2}{2} ] Let ( t ) be the greatest integer such that: [ sum_{i=1}^{t} frac{1}{a_i} < 1 ] This implies the partial sum after ( t ) integers is less than 1: [ sum_{i=t+1}^{m} frac{1}{a_i} < frac{k + 2}{2} - 1 = frac{k}{2} ] By the induction hypothesis, this can be divided into ( k ) groups where the sum of the reciprocals in each group is less than 1. Therefore, by including the first ( t ) integers as one more group where the sum is also less than 1, we would have divided the entire set into ( k+1 ) groups with the required properties. Hence, by induction, ( C_{max} = frac{n+1}{2} ) for all ( n geq 1 ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{n+1}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given an ellipse C:frac{{{x^2}}}{{{a^2}}}+frac{{{y^2}}}{{{b^2}}}=1({a＞b＞0}), a circle with center at the origin O and radius sqrt{{a^2}+{b^2}} is called the pseudocircle of ellipse C.

Denote this common center by (O). 3. **Rotation Insight**: When the square (KLMN) is rotated (90^circ) around (O), the square maps onto itself. This implies that each side of the square will rotate to lie perpendicular to its original position and pass through the center. 4. **Determine Perpendicular Side**: Since the vertex (N) is on the side (AD) of the parallelogram, after a (90^circ) rotation around (O), (N) maps to (M), which should lie on the side (CD). Similarly, side (AD) of the parallelogram rotates to a line perpendicular to it and passing through (M). 5. **Construct Perpendicular Intersection**: To find the intersection point (M), rotate the side (AD) by (90^circ) around point (O) to obtain a new line. This line should be perpendicular to (AD) and pass through (O). Let this perpendicular intersect side (CD) of the parallelogram at point (M).

This gives us m < 3 or m > 5. For the second inequality, m^2 + 3m - 28 < 0, we also find the zeros of the quadratic equation m^2 + 3m - 28 = 0. Factoring gives us (m + 7)(m - 4) = 0. Thus, the roots are m = -7 and m = 4. Since this quadratic also has a positive leading coefficient, it will be negative between the two roots, which gives us -7 < m < 4. Combining these two intervals, we find -7 < m < 3. Therefore, the condition for the fourth quadrant is satisfied when m is within this interval. Our answer is: [ boxed{-7 < m < 3} ] (2) For the point to lie on the negative half of the x-axis, the following conditions must be met: [ begin{cases} m^2 - 8m + 15 < 0 m^2 + 3m - 28 = 0 end{cases} ] The first condition, m^2 - 8m + 15 < 0, indicates that the real part of z is negative, and this occurs within the interval 3 < m < 5 based on our analysis from part (1). The second condition, m^2 + 3m - 28 = 0, results in the imaginary part of z being zero. As derived earlier, this occurs when m = -7 or m = 4. However, only m = 4 is within the interval 3 < m < 5, thus satisfying both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the value of m must be: [ boxed{m = 4} ] (3) For the point to be in the upper half-plane (including the real axis), the imaginary part of z must be greater than or equal to zero, i.e., m^2 + 3m - 28 geq 0. Using the factorization from earlier, we know that (m + 7)(m - 4) geq 0. This inequality holds for m geq 4 or m leq -7. Therefore, the condition for the upper half-plane (including the real axis) is satisfied for: [ boxed{m geq 4 text{ or } m leq -7} ]"},{"prompt":"Given x, y in mathbb{Z}, n in mathbb{N}^*, let f(n) be the number of feasible solutions within the planar region represented by the system of inequalities begin{cases} x geq 1 0 leq y leq x + n end{cases}, then f(2) = ______.","completion":"When n=2, the system of inequalities corresponds to begin{cases} x geq 1 y geq 0 y leq -x + 2 end{cases}. - For x=1, the system is equivalent to begin{cases} x = 1 y geq 0 y leq 1 end{cases}.

When the train crosses the bridge, it has to cover a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the bridge to completely cross it. The time taken to cross the bridge is 10 seconds. So, the distance covered when crossing the bridge is L (length of the train) + 200 m (length of the bridge). When the train crosses the lamp post, it only has to cover a distance equal to its own length, because the lamp post is essentially a point on the bridge. The time taken to cross the lamp post is 5 seconds. So, the distance covered when crossing the lamp post is L (length of the train). Since the train takes 5 seconds to cross the lamp post, we can establish the speed of the train (S) as: S = L / 5 seconds Now, using the same speed (S), we can calculate the time it takes to cross the bridge: S = (L + 200 m) / 10 seconds Since the speed of the train is constant, we can set the two equations equal to each other: L / 5 = (L + 200) / 10 Now, we can solve for L: 10 * L = 5 * (L + 200) 10L = 5L + 1000 10L - 5L = 1000 5L = 1000 L = 1000 / 5 L = 200 m Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{200} meters."},{"prompt":"A pirate schooner boarded a merchant ship.

Define (f(x)) as this unique positive integer (x cdot 2^t). For example: [ f(12345) = 12345, quad f(4321) = 17284, quad f(700) = 11200, quad f(1) = 16384 ] 3. **Injectivity of (f(x))**: If (f(x) = f(y)), then (frac{x}{y} = 2^k) for some integer (k), implying one of (x) or (y) divides the other.

Since both (x cdot 2^{g(x)}) and (xy cdot 2^{g(xy)}) are in (X) and distinct, this leads to a contradiction.

Let's calculate the growth for each of the remaining months: Month 5: 2.2 inches * 110% = 2.42 inches Month 6: 2.42 inches * 110% = 2.662 inches Month 7: 2.662 inches * 110% = 2.9282 inches Month 8: 2.9282 inches * 110% = 3.22102 inches Month 9: 3.22102 inches * 110% = 3.543122 inches Month 10: 3.543122 inches * 110% = 3.8974342 inches Month 11: 3.8974342 inches * 110% = 4.28717762 inches Month 12: 4.28717762 inches * 110% = 4.715895382 inches Now, let's add up all the growth from months 4 to 12: 2.2 + 2.42 + 2.662 + 2.9282 + 3.22102 + 3.543122 + 3.8974342 + 4.28717762 + 4.715895382 = 30.875961404 inches Adding this to his height after the initial 3 months, we get his final height after one year: 72 inches + 30.875961404 inches = 102.875961404 inches To convert his height to centimeters, we use the conversion factor 1 inch = 2.54 cm: 102.875961404 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 261.303941086 cm So, John's height after one year is approximately 261.3 cm. Now, let's find the average height increase per month in inches. We know that he grew a total of 6 inches in the first 3 months and 30.875961404 inches in the next 9 months, making a total growth of: 6 inches + 30.875961404 inches = 36.875961404 inches The average monthly increase over the 12 months is: 36.875961404 inches / 12 months = 3.072996784 inches/month So, the average height increase per month is approximately boxed{3.07} inches."},{"prompt":"f aast b = 4a + 5b ab, what is the value of 7 ast 3?","completion":"Using the modified function, a ast b = 4a + 5b - ab, we need to calculate the value of 7 ast 3: [ 7 ast 3 = 4(7) + 5(3) - (7)(3) = 28 + 15 - 21 ] [ 7 ast 3 = 28 + 15 - 21 = 22 ] Thus, the value is boxed{22}."},{"prompt":"Find the value of b so that the lines with the given equations are perpendicular: [ y = 3x + 4 ] [ 2y + bx = 10 ]","completion":"For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1.

After eating L slices for lunch, she had 12 - L slices left. For dinner, she ate 1/3 of the remaining pizza, which means she ate (1/3) * (12 - L) slices. After dinner, she has 4 slices left. So, the equation representing the situation after dinner is: 12 - L - (1/3) * (12 - L) = 4 Now, let's solve for L: 12 - L - 4 + (1/3)L = 4 12 - L + (1/3)L = 8 (3/3)L - (1/3)L = 8 - 12 (2/3)L = -4 L = -4 / (2/3) L = -4 * (3/2) L = -6 However, we cannot have a negative number of slices eaten, so there must be a mistake in our calculation. Let's try again. We know that after dinner, Donna has 4 slices left. She ate 1/3 of the remaining pizza for dinner, which means that 2/3 of the pizza was left after dinner. So, the 4 slices represent 2/3 of the pizza after lunch.

We analyze each permissible move to determine how it affects S: - For the move to (y, x): [ S' = y + x = S ] - For the move to (3x, -2y): [ S' = 3x + (-2y) = 3x - 2y ] - For the move to (-2x, 3y): [ S' = -2x + 3y ] - For the move to (x+1, y+4): [ S' = (x + 1) + (y + 4) = x + y + 5 = S + 5 ] - For the move to (x-1, y-4): [ S' = (x - 1) + (y - 4) = x + y - 5 = S - 5 ] 3. From the above, we observe that the sum S = x + y: - Remains the same for the move (y, x). - Changes to 3x - 2y or -2x + 3y for the respective moves. - Increases or decreases by 5 for moves (x+1, y+4) and (x-1, y-4), respectively. 4.

This map essentially \\"wraps\\" the polygon (mathcal{P}) into the unit square ([0,1)^2). 2. **Area preservation:** The map ( f ) is composed of translations by integer vectors, which locally preserve area. Therefore, the area of the image of (mathcal{P}) under ( f ), denoted as ( f(mathcal{P}) ), is less than or equal to the area of (mathcal{P}). Mathematically, this is expressed as: [ |f(mathcal{P})| leq |mathcal{P}| ] 3. **Assumption of injectivity:** Assume that there are no two points in (mathcal{P}) that differ by an integer vector. This implies that the map ( f ) is injective, meaning that no two points in (mathcal{P}) are mapped to the same point in ([0,1)^2). 4. **Equality of areas:** Since ( f ) is injective, the area of the image ( f(mathcal{P}) ) is equal to the area of (mathcal{P}): [ |f(mathcal{P})| = |mathcal{P}| ] 5. **Contradiction:** The image ( f(mathcal{P}) ) is contained within the unit square ([0,1)^2), which has an area of 1.

We need to find the ratio of the area of the inscribed square to the area of the large square. 2. **Visualizing the Grid:** The large square is divided into a 3 times 3 grid of smaller squares, each with side length 1 unit (since each side of the large square is trisected). 3. **Identifying the Inscribed Square:** The inscribed square's vertices are located at the midpoints of the sides of the central square of the grid. This forms a square rotated by 45 degrees relative to the large square. 4. **Calculating the Side Length of the Inscribed Square:** The side length of the inscribed square can be calculated using the distance between any two adjacent trisection points on the large square. Since each side of the large square is divided into three equal parts, each part has a length of frac{1}{3} of the side of the large square. The inscribed square spans two such segments diagonally from one corner of a central small square to the opposite corner. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the side length s of the inscribed square is: [ s = sqrt{left(frac{2}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{2}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{4}{9} + frac{4}{9}} = sqrt{frac{8}{9}} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} ] 5. **Area of the Inscribed Square:** The area A_{text{inscribed}} of the inscribed square is: [ A_{text{inscribed}} = left(frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}right)^2 = frac{8}{9} ] 6. **Area of the Large Square:** The area A_{text{large}} of the large square, considering each side of the large square is 1 unit, is: [ A_{text{large}} = 1^2 = 1 ] 7. **Ratio of the Areas:** The ratio of the area of the inscribed square to the area of the large square is: [ text{Ratio} = frac{A_{text{inscribed}}}{A_{text{large}}} = frac{frac{8}{9}}{1} = frac{8}{9} ] However, this contradicts the earlier calculation and the provided options. Let's re-evaluate the areas considering the grid structure and the correct placement of the inscribed square vertices. 8. **Revisiting the Grid Structure:** The inscribed square is formed by connecting points that are one unit apart horizontally and vertically, thus each side of the inscribed square is sqrt{2} units (since it spans one grid square diagonally). 9. **Corrected Area of the Inscribed Square:** [ A_{text{inscribed}} = (sqrt{2})^2 = 2 ] 10. **Corrected Ratio of the Areas:** [ text{Ratio} = frac{A_{text{inscribed}}}{A_{text{large}}} = frac{2}{9} ] This calculation still seems incorrect based on the options provided. The correct approach should consider the inscribed square as consisting of four triangles and a central square, as initially described. 11. **Final Calculation:** The triangles each have an area of 1, and the central square has an area of 1, making the total area of the inscribed square 5. The large square has an area of 9. Thus, the correct ratio is: [ text{Ratio} = frac{5}{9} ] This matches option (B).

Let's detail each of the three methods provided to solve the problem: Method 1 We will use the midpoint theorem of a triangle. 1. Let ( A ) be the vertex of the given angle. 2. Draw a line through point ( M ) parallel to one of the sides of the angle. Let ( K ) be the intersection point of this line with the other side of the angle. 3. On the extension of segment ( AK ) beyond ( K ), mark a point ( B ) such that ( KB = AK ). 4. Then, the line segment ( BM ) is the required line, since ( KM ) is the midpoint line in the resulting triangle ( ABK ), meaning ( M ) bisects ( BC ). To summarize in steps: 1. Draw line ( AM ). 2. Construct a line through ( M ) parallel to one side of the angle until it meets the other side at point ( K ). 3. Extend ( AK ) to point ( B ) such that ( AK = KB ). 4. Draw line segment ( BM ). Since ( KM ) is the midpoint line of triangle ( ABK ), ( M ) bisects ( BC ). Method 2 1. Let ( XAY ) be the given angle and ( P ) be a point on the extension of the segment ( AM ) beyond point ( M ) such that ( MP = AM ). 2. Through point ( P ), draw a line parallel to the side ( AX ) of the given angle. Let ( B ) be the intersection point of this line with the other side ( AY ), and let ( C ) be the intersection of line ( BM ) with the side ( AX ). 3. The line segment ( BC ) is the required line. To summarize in steps: 1. Extend ( AM ) to locate point ( P ) such that ( MP = AM ). 2. Draw a line through ( P ) parallel to ( AX ) to intersect ( AY ) at point ( B ). 3. Intersect line ( BM ) with ( AX ) to find point ( C ). Since triangle ( PMB ) is congruent to triangle ( AMC ) (by the side-angle-side congruence criterion), ( M ) bisects ( BC ). Method 3 1. Denote the sides of the given angle as ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). Let ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 ) be the reflections of ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) about point ( M ) respectively. 2. Let ( B ) be the intersection of ( l_1 ) and ( m_2 ), and let ( C ) be the intersection of ( l_2 ) and ( m_1 ). 3. The line ( BC ) is the desired line. To summarize in steps: 1. Reflect sides ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) about point ( M ) to get lines ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 ). 2. Locate intersections ( B ) and ( C ) of ( l_1 ) with ( m_2 ) and ( l_2 ) with ( m_1 ) respectively. 3. Draw the line segment ( BC ). Since the symmetry about ( M ) ensures that ( M ) bisects the segment ( BC ), ( M ) divides ( BC ) into two equal parts. Conclusively, for any of these methods, we have constructed a line segment through ( M ) such that ( M ) bisects the line segment enclosed between the sides of the angle, as required.

The rate at which each pump fills the trough can be expressed as a fraction of the trough filled per second. The old pump fills the trough in 600 seconds, so its rate is ( frac{1}{600} ) trough per second. The new pump fills the trough in 200 seconds, so its rate is ( frac{1}{200} ) trough per second. When both pumps are working together, their rates add up. So, the combined rate is: ( frac{1}{600} + frac{1}{200} = frac{1}{600} + frac{3}{600} = frac{4}{600} ) Simplify the fraction: ( frac{4}{600} = frac{1}{150} ) This means that together, the pumps can fill ( frac{1}{150} ) of the trough per second.

The average speed including stoppages is given as 40 km/hr. This means that in one hour, the bus covers 40 km. Now, we need to find out how much distance the bus would cover in 40 minutes without stoppages. Since 40 minutes is ( frac{2}{3} ) of an hour (because ( frac{40}{60} = frac{2}{3} )), we can calculate the distance covered in 40 minutes at the speed ( V ) as follows: Distance covered in 40 minutes = ( V times frac{2}{3} ) Since this distance must be equal to the distance covered in one hour with stoppages (which is 40 km), we can set up the equation: ( V times frac{2}{3} = 40 ) To find ( V ), we solve for it: ( V = frac{40}{frac{2}{3}} ) ( V = 40 times frac{3}{2} ) ( V = 20 times 3 ) ( V = 60 ) km/hr So, the average speed of the bus excluding stoppages is boxed{60} km/hr."},{"prompt":"A right square pyramid, with a base edge of 12 units and a slant height of 15 units, is intersected by a plane parallel to the base at a height of 5 units from the base.

Given that a = sqrt{2} = 2^{0.5} and b=2^{0.8}, and considering that 0.8 > 0.5, it implies that b > a. 2. Additionally, 2^0 = 1 is the value of the exponential function at x=0.

When f'(x) < 0, we have x > 1, which means the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (1, +infty). Thus, the function f(x) has a maximum value at x = 1, and f(1) = 1.

We have proved that 0 < m < 1. ② Given that 0 < x_1 < 1 < x_2, then 2 - x_1 > 1. Let G(x) = f(2 - x) - f(x) = frac{e^{2-x}}{e^{2-x}} - frac{e^x}{e^x}, for 0 < x < 1.

Here is a possible sequence of moves: - Calculate (2016 - 47 = 1969). Now the numbers on the board are (2016, 47, 1969). - Continue subtracting (47): [ 1969 - 1 cdot 47 = 1922 ] - [ 1922 - 1 cdot 47 = 1875 ] - Continue this process until ( 47 cdot k < 2016 ). The game progresses by continually introducing new numbers based on differences. 3. **Analysis through Residue Classes and Final Moves**: - Consider the differences that arise from repeated subtractions: (1969 - 41 cdot 47 = 42). This means after several subtractions, we end up with numbers around 42. - (47 - 42 = 5). Now the set includes the number 5. - Reduce numbers by repeatedly subtracting 5: [ 42 - 41 cdot 1 = 1 ] - Eventually, the sequence include (1), so every number can progressively be constructed by continuing such steps. 4. **Concept of (M) and Important Game Theory Invariant**: Let (M) be the set of all numbers that appear on the board during the game.

Here, a = -6, b = 0, and c = 0, with the vertex at the origin (0,0). The value of p can be found using the formula p = frac{1}{4a}, where a is the coefficient of x^2. Thus, for our parabola, p = frac{1}{4(-6)} = -frac{1}{24}. Since the parabola opens downwards, the directrix is above the vertex, and its equation is given by y = k - p. Given that the vertex is at (0,0), we have k = 0. Therefore, the equation of the directrix is y = 0 - (-frac{1}{24}) = frac{1}{24}. So, the equation of the directrix of the parabola y = -6x^2 is boxed{y = frac{1}{24}}."},{"prompt":"The length of a room is some meters and width is 2.75 m.

Since there are ( n! ) permutations of ({1, 2, ldots, n}), we obtain ( n! ) distinct values for ( S(a) ) modulo ( n! ). 2. **Summing ( S(a) ) Over All Permutations**: Consider the sum of ( S(a) ) over all permutations ( a ): [ sum_{a} S(a) ] By the given assumption, the values ( S(a) equiv 0, 1, 2, ldots, (n!-1) pmod{n!} ): [ sum_{a} S(a) equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n!-1) pmod{n!} ] 3. **Sum of First ( n! ) Integers**: The sum of the first ( n! ) integers can be calculated as: [ sum_{k=0}^{n!-1} k = frac{(n!)(n!-1)}{2} ] Simplifying, since (n! ) divides itself: [ frac{(n!)(n!-1)}{2} equiv 0 pmod{n!} ] 4. **Rewriting ( S(a) ) Sum Expression**: Express ( S(a) ) in another form: [ S(a) = sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i a_i ] Note that each ( a_i ) runs through all values from 1 to ( n ) in each ( (n-1)! ) permutations. So, summing over all permutations ( a ), each ( c_i ) is multiplied by the sum of all integers from 1 to ( n ): 5. **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficient of ( c_i ) in (sum_a S(a) ) is: [ (n-1)!(1 + 2 + cdots + n) = (n-1)! left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) ] Thus, the total sum: [ sum_a S(a) = sum_{i=1}^n c_i (n-1)! left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) = left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) (n-1)!

Specifically: [ (n-1)! cdot left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) n! ] Divides ( n! ): [ sum_a S(a) equiv 0 pmod{n!} ] 7. **Contradiction**: We have obtained two equivalences: [ sum_a S(a) equiv frac{(n!)(n!-1)}{2} equiv 0 pmod{n!} ] [ sum_a S(a) equiv left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) (n-1)! sum c_i pmod{n!} ] If ( sum c_i ) is not zero modulo ( n! ), a contradiction occurs due to unique non-constant modulo ( n! ) assumptions. This confirms the contradiction. In conclusion, the given assumption that all ( S(a) ) values are distinct modulo ( n! ) is false, proving that there exist permutations ( a neq b ) such that ( n! ) divides ( S(a) - S(b) ).

The number of grades that are 3 is increased by a, so the new counts of grades will be: - a = 0 (all 1s changed to 3s), - c' = c + a.

Therefore, we can represent this number as: [ N = underbrace{999 ldots 99}_{k text{ digits}} ] 2. We recognize that ( N ) can also be expressed as: [ N = 10^k - 1 ] This representation comes from the fact that ( underbrace{999 ldots 99}_{k text{ digits}} ) is ( 10^k - 1 ). 3.

Consider the subset ( A ) consisting of numbers that all have the same last digit. For instance, let's take all numbers ending in 0 from the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 2015}). The numbers ending in 0 within this range are: [ 10, 20, 30, ldots, 2010 ] This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 10 ) and common difference ( d = 10 ). The number of terms ( n ) in this sequence can be found by solving: [ 10 + (n-1) cdot 10 = 2010 ] [ 10n = 2010 ] [ n = 201 ] Thus, there are 201 numbers ending in 0. To form a subset with 400 elements, we can take 200 numbers ending in 0 and 200 numbers ending in 5. The numbers ending in 5 within the range are: [ 5, 15, 25, ldots, 2005 ] This also forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 5 ) and common difference ( d = 10 ). The number of terms ( n ) in this sequence can be found by solving: [ 5 + (n-1) cdot 10 = 2005 ] [ 10n = 2000 ] [ n = 201 ] Thus, there are 201 numbers ending in 5.

Let ( A ) be a good subset with 405 elements. For any element ( x ) in ( A ), the sum of all other elements in ( A ) must have the same last digit as ( x ). Let ( s ) be a number in ( A ) and ( s equiv k pmod{10} ). Then: [ sum_{d in A} d equiv 2k pmod{10} ] This implies that for any ( i in A ), ( i equiv k pmod{10} ) or ( i equiv k+5 pmod{10} ). Therefore, the elements of ( A ) must end in either ( k ) or ( k+5 ). Since there are only 10 possible last digits (0 through 9), and each last digit can appear at most 201 times in the range ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 2015}), the maximum number of elements in ( A ) that can end in ( k ) or ( k+5 ) is: [ 201 + 201 = 402 ] Thus, the maximum size of a good subset is 402, which is less than 405.

This implies that the sum ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ) must be odd (since the product ( a_1a_2a_3 ) is always odd if all ( a_i ) are primes). 3. **Considering the parity of ( a_i )**: For ( P ) to be odd, the sum ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ) must be odd. This requires that exactly one of ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) is even (since the sum of three odd numbers is odd, and the sum of two odd numbers and one even number is odd). 4. **Prime numbers**: The only even prime number is 2.

What is the average monthly production growth rate of the factory? (2) It is known that a certain store can sell an average of 20 Bing Duan Duan per day, with a profit of 40 yuan each. If the price is reduced by 1 yuan, the store can sell 5 more items without reducing the price by more than 10 yuan. If the store needs to make a profit of 1440 yuan per day, how much should the price of each Bing Duan Duan be reduced by?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Average Monthly Production Growth Rate Given that the factory produced 500 \\"Bing Duan Duan\\" in February and 720 in April, we are to find the average monthly production growth rate, x. 1. Let the average monthly production growth rate be x. 2. The production in April can be represented as the production in February multiplied by (1+x)^2 because there are two months (February to April) of growth. 3. Therefore, we have the equation: 500(1+x)^2 = 720. 4. Solving for x, we rearrange the equation: (1+x)^2 = frac{720}{500} = 1.44. 5. Taking the square root of both sides, we find 1+x = sqrt{1.44} = 1.2. 6. Solving for x, we get x = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2 or 20%. The other solution, x = -2.2, is not feasible as a growth rate cannot be negative in this context. Therefore, the average monthly production growth rate of the factory is boxed{20%}.

The store needs to make a profit of 1440 yuan per day. 1. Let the reduction in price be y yuan. 2. The new profit per item would be (40-y) yuan. 3. The number of items sold per day would increase to (20+5y). 4. The total profit per day can be represented as the product of the profit per item and the number of items sold: (40-y)(20+5y) = 1440. 5. Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 800 + 200y - 20y - 5y^2 = 1440. 6. Rearranging, we have: 5y^2 - 180y + 640 = 0. 7. Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for y: y_{1} = 4 and y_{2} = 32. 8.

When the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1 cm, which means the volume of water displaced by the boat increases by the volume of a rectangular prism with a length equal to the length of the boat (which we need to find), a breadth of 3 m, and a height of 1 cm (0.01 m).

We aim to find the minimum number of red vertices required to achieve this. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - A square (ABCD) is divided into (n^2) unit squares. - Each unit square is further divided into two triangles by the diagonal parallel to (BD). - We need to color some vertices red such that each of these (2n^2) triangles contains at least one red vertex. 2. **Analyzing the Triangles:** - Each unit square has 4 vertices. - The diagonal divides each unit square into two triangles. - Each triangle shares vertices with adjacent triangles. 3. **Optimal Coloring Strategy:** - To minimize the number of red vertices, we should try to color vertices that are shared by multiple triangles. - Consider the vertices of the unit squares in a grid pattern. We can color vertices in a checkerboard pattern, where vertices at positions ((i, j)) with (i + j) even are colored red. 4. **Checkerboard Pattern:** - In a checkerboard pattern, each vertex at ((i, j)) with (i + j) even is colored red. - This ensures that each triangle has at least one red vertex because each triangle will have at least one vertex with (i + j) even. 5. **Counting the Red Vertices:** - In an (n times n) grid, there are (n^2) vertices. - Half of these vertices will have (i + j) even, and the other half will have (i + j) odd. - Therefore, the number of red vertices is (leftlceil frac{n^2}{2} rightrceil). 6. **Verification:** - For (n) even, (frac{n^2}{2}) is an integer. - For (n) odd, (frac{n^2}{2}) is not an integer, so we take the ceiling function to ensure all triangles are covered.

Given that the circle is touching all four sides of the rhombus F_1B_1F_2B_2 implies that B_1B_2 is perpendicular to A_1A_2.

This implies that there exist at least two individuals who haven't shaken hands with each other.

The reasoning is as follows: - (A_1) has not shaken hands with (A_2) (one person) and thus is left with (N-1) potential people. - Given the condition of at least one person not shaking hands with every other, there's at least one omission for each of these two individuals. 4. **Evaluate the Remaining People:** Since (A_1) and (A_2) must both comply with the constraint, the maximum number of people either can shake hands with is: [ N - 2 ] This is the total number of other people less the specific restriction with each other. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the maximum number of people that any one person in that room could have shaken hands with is: [ boxed{N-2} ] Given the answer choices (A) 0, (B) 1, (C) (N-1), (D) (N), and (E) None of these, the proper selection based on our detailed analysis is: [ boxed{E} quad text{(None of these)} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( n ) be a fixed positive integer, and let ( S ) be the set of points ((x, y)) on the Cartesian plane such that both coordinates ( x ) and ( y ) are nonnegative integers smaller than ( 2n ) (thus (|S| = 4n^2)).

For A: Cost = 24 cows * x months * C For B: Cost = 10 cows * 5 months * C For C: Cost = 35 cows * 4 months * C For D: Cost = 21 cows * 3 months * C We know that A's share of the rent is Rs. 1440, so: 24x * C = 1440 We can solve for C: C = 1440 / (24x) The total rent of the field is Rs. 6500, so the sum of the costs for all milkmen should equal Rs. 6500: (24x * C) + (10 * 5 * C) + (35 * 4 * C) + (21 * 3 * C) = 6500 Substitute the value of C from the previous equation: (24x * (1440 / (24x))) + (10 * 5 * (1440 / (24x))) + (35 * 4 * (1440 / (24x))) + (21 * 3 * (1440 / (24x))) = 6500 Simplify the equation: 1440 + (50 * (1440 / (24x))) + (140 * (1440 / (24x))) + (63 * (1440 / (24x))) = 6500 Combine the terms with C: 1440 + (1440 / (24x)) * (50 + 140 + 63) = 6500 Calculate the sum inside the parentheses: 1440 + (1440 / (24x)) * 253 = 6500 Subtract 1440 from both sides: (1440 / (24x)) * 253 = 6500 - 1440 Calculate the right side: (1440 / (24x)) * 253 = 5060 Divide both sides by 253: (1440 / (24x)) = 5060 / 253 Simplify the right side: (1440 / (24x)) = 20 Multiply both sides by (24x): 1440 = 20 * (24x) Divide both sides by 20: x = 1440 / (20 * 24) Calculate x: x = 1440 / 480 Simplify: x = 3 So, A grazed his cows for boxed{3} months."},{"prompt":"w many distinct, positive factors does 1728 have?","completion":"Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 1728.
