The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence, S_n, is given by: S_n = a_1 frac{1-q^n}{1-q}, for q neq 1. Since it is stated that {S_n} is an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms of {S_n} is constant. Therefore: S_{n+1} - S_n = S_n - S_{n-1}. Substituting the formula for S_n into this equation, we get: a_1 frac{1-q^{n+1}}{1-q} - a_1 frac{1-q^n}{1-q} = a_1 frac{1-q^n}{1-q} - a_1 frac{1-q^{n-1}}{1-q}.

The bisector of the exterior angle at C intersects BA extended at point Q (A is between Q and B). Find the ratio QA:AB.","completion":"Let AC = 2x and BC = 3x. Draw Y, where Y is on BC such that AC parallel QY. By AA Similarity, triangle ABC sim triangle QBY, so QY = 2ay, BY = 3ay, and CY = 3ay - 3x. Also, let angle ABC = alpha and angle BAC = beta. Since the angles of a triangle add up to 180^circ, angle BCA = 180^circ - alpha - beta. By the Exterior Angle Theorem, angle ACY = alpha + beta, and since CQ bisects angle ACY, angle QCY = frac{alpha + beta}{2}. Because AC parallel QY, angle BYQ = 180^circ - alpha - beta. Thus, angle CQY = frac{alpha + beta}{2}, making triangle CQY an isosceles triangle. Since triangle CQY is isosceles, QY = CY, so 3ay - 3x = 2ay. Solving this, we find a = 3, hence QB = 3 cdot AB. Therefore, QA = QB - AB = 2 cdot AB, which implies that QA : AB = boxed{2:1}."},{"prompt":"An isosceles trapezoid has legs of length 40 cm each, two diagonals of length 50 cm each, and the longer base is 60 cm. What is the trapezoid's area in sq cm?","completion":"We start by identifying a triangle formed by one diagonal, a leg, and the longer base. These lines form a triangle with sides of length 40, 50, and 60. This set of lengths also forms a Pythagorean triple (multiplied by 10 from the 5-4-3 triangle), resulting in a right triangle. Hence, the altitude h to the longer base from the other base can be calculated using the relationship in a right triangle where side lengths are 40 (leg), 50 (diagonal as hypotenuse): [ h = sqrt{50^2 - 30^2} = sqrt{2500 - 900} = sqrt{1600} = 40 ] cm. This altitude is the same as the height of the trapezoid due to the trapezoid's isosceles property. To find the length of the shorter base, we consider the smaller triangle formed by this altitude, one leg, and part of the longer base. Here, the triangle's legs are the altitude h = 40 and the segment along the base. Since the full longer base is 60 cm and there are two equal segments (isosceles property), we initially find the segment x along the longer base: [ x^2 = 40^2 - 30^2 = 1600 - 900 = 700 ] [ x = sqrt{700} approx 26.46 ] cm. Therefore, the shorter base would then be [ 60 - 2 times 26.46 approx 7.08 ] cm. The area of the trapezoid is calculated as [ text{Area} = dfrac{(60 + 7.08) times 40}{2} = dfrac{67.08 times 40}{2} = 1336.6 ] sq cm, approximately.

For the array to be stable, a_{0, 1} must be equal to s_1 because there are no other rows or columns to compare. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: - Assume the theorem holds for an array of size n-1, i.e., for any nondecreasing sequence {s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{n-1}}, there exists a unique stable triangular array such that the sum of the entries in row k equals s_k for k = 1 to n-1. 3. **Inductive Step for n, Base Case for N = s_{n-1}**: - Consider an array of size n. - If N = s_{n-1}, the stable array can be formed by copying the n-1st row and adding a zero at the end: [ {a_{i, j}}_{0 leq i < j leq n-1} = {a_{i, j}}_{0 leq i < j leq n-2} ] - This ensures that a_{i, n} = a_{i, n-1} for i = 0 to n-2 and a_{n-1, n} = 0. - The sum of the entries in the nth row will thus be s_{n-1} + 0 = s_{n-1}, which matches our base case N = s_{n-1}.

This ensures stability for the sum N + 1. - For uniqueness, take the nonzero sink of the tournament and decrement it, ensuring uniqueness for N by our inductive hypothesis.

First, observe that within the range from (1^2) to (2005^2), there are (2005) terms. 3. Among these (2005) terms, there are (frac{2005 + 1}{2} = 1003) odd squares and (1002) even squares. 4. The sum of these (2005) squares without any signs will be an odd number because it is the sum of an odd number of odd terms (where each odd term contributes an odd value) plus the sum of an even number of even terms (where each even term contributes an even value). 5. Changing the \\"+\\" to \\"-\\" on any term will alter the parity of the sum, but it will still result in an odd total when summed. 6. We need to ensure that we can find a way to split these terms such that their sum is minimized but still remains non-negative. 7. To proceed, let's use a small set to identify a pattern. Consider the relationship: [ n^2 - (n+1)^2 - (n+2)^2 + (n+3)^2 = 4 ] Grouping terms with signs as specified above, for every 8 consecutive perfect squares, their sum will be (0).

We aim to demonstrate that each group contains exactly 2 liars. Case 1: The first person in a group is a knight If the first person is a knight, then their statement must be true.

Thus, the group must contain exactly 2 liars. Case 2: The first person in a group is a liar If the first person is a liar, then their statement is false. This means that among the five people sitting consecutively to their right, there are at most 1 liar. If there are no liars at all, that would mean the first person’s statement was in error, but since they are a liar, at most 1 liar must be present among the five.

Therefore, ( n ) can be written as: [ n = m cdot 2^k cdot 5^k ] where ( m ) is an integer such that ( m ) is not divisible by 10 (since ( n > 10^k )). 3. **Factor ( n ) as ( 4uv ):** Since ( n ) is divisible by ( 4 ) (because ( k geq 2 )), we can write: [ n = 4uv ] where ( u ) and ( v ) are integers.

Adding b to both sides, we get kx_{1} + b < kx_{2} + b, which means y_{1} < y_{2}. This contradicts the statement that y_{1} > y_{2}. Therefore, conclusion ① is incorrect. **Conclusion ② Analysis:** For a line y=kx+b to pass through the first, second, and third quadrants: - Passing through the first and third quadrants implies k > 0 because the slope must be positive for the line to move from the third quadrant (negative x, negative y) to the first quadrant (positive x, positive y). - To also pass through the second quadrant, b must be positive. This is because, with k > 0, the line will only intersect the y-axis above the origin if b > 0. Therefore, for the line to pass through the first, second, and third quadrants, it is necessary that k > 0 and b > 0.

Therefore, the conclusion that m=pm 1 is based on the correct solving process, but the interpretation provided in the solution is misleading. The correct interpretation should acknowledge that m=pm 1 satisfies the equation 3=m^{2}+2, making conclusion ③ correct. **Final Conclusion:** Upon reevaluation, conclusions ② and ③ are correct, while conclusion ① is incorrect.

Thus, they form an equilateral triangle on the circle, each angle being (120^circ).

We need to prove that if ( m > frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(4n - 15)}{600} ), then there exist ( A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, ldots, A_{i_6} ) such that ( bigcup_{k = 1}^6 A_{i_k} = X ). 2. **Double Counting Argument:** We will use a double counting argument to establish some lemmas. We will count the number of ways to choose 6-element subsets of ( X ) such that 5 of them belong to one ( A_i ). 3. **Counting for ( n = 7 ):** For ( n = 7 ), the number of ways to choose 6-element subsets of ( X ) is ( binom{7}{6} = 7 ). Each 6-element subset can be formed by adding one element to a 5-element subset. Since there are ( m ) such 5-element subsets, the total number of ways to form 6-element subsets is ( 5m ).

The number of ways to choose 8-element subsets of ( X ) is ( binom{n}{8} ). Each 8-element subset can be formed by adding three elements to a 5-element subset.

Therefore, we can write: [ P(x) = Q(x) P'(x), ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree 1.

Substituting ( k = n ) in the expression we have: [ P(x) = (x - x_0)^n Q(x), ] but since ( Q(x) neq 0 ) at ( x_0 ), ( Q(x) ) should be a constant, say ( a_n ).

Denote these roots by (r_i) such that: [ 1 < r_1 < 2 < r_2 < cdots < 63 < r_{63}. ] Consequently, (P(x)), which includes factors corresponding to roots (r_i) and the integers (k) from 1 to 63, changes signs at these points. 6. **Interval Analysis:** Given that (P(x)) is negative at ( pm infty ), it must alternate in sign across the roots: generally becoming positive on intervals ((k, r_k)) for (k = 1, 2, ldots, 63). 7. **Union of Intervals:** Therefore, the solution set is: [ bigcup_{k=1}^{63} [k, r_k]. ] 8. **Summing Lengths of the Intervals:** The total length of all these intervals is given by: [ sum_{k=1}^{63} (r_k - k). ] 9. **Sum of Roots:** Using the relationship between coefficients and roots from polynomial theory, particularly the coefficient of (x^{62}) in (R(x)), we obtain: [ sum_{i=1}^{63} r_i = 2 sum_{i=1}^{63} i. ] 10. **Calculating the Sum:** Since (sum_{i=1}^{63} i) represents the sum of the first 63 positive integers, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{63} i = frac{63 cdot 64}{2} = 2016. ] 11. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the total length of the intervals is: [ sum_{k=1}^{63} (r_k - k) = 2016. ] [ boxed{2016} ]"},{"prompt":"Let there be an integer ngeq2 .

This expands to 2sin Acos C - 2cos Asin C = sin Acos C + cos Asin C. - Simplifying, we get sin Acos C = 3cos Asin C. Substituting cos C = sin C = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we have frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sin A = 3timesfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}cos A, which simplifies to sin A = 3cos A. - Knowing that sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1, we substitute cos A = frac{1}{3}sin A into this identity to get sin^2 A + frac{1}{9}sin^2 A = 1, leading to sin^2 A = frac{9}{10}.

Let this cycle be ( u_1, u_2, ldots, u_k ). - By the properties given, for any two friends ( X' ) and ( X'' ), ( t(X') neq t(X'') ).

It is possible to divide the five points into two nonempty sets ( S ) and ( T ) such that each segment has one endpoint in ( S ) and the other endpoint in ( T ).","completion":"\`\`\`markdown To solve the given problem, we'll break it down into several clear steps and cases. Let's begin by analyzing the conditions given and tallying the number of possible segment sets. Step 1: Understanding the Constraints **First Condition:** It must be possible to travel from any of the five points to any other of the five points along the drawn segments. This requires the graph to be connected, meaning there must be a path between any pair of points. **Second Condition:** It must be possible to divide the five points into two non-empty sets ( S ) and ( T ) such that each segment has one endpoint in ( S ) and the other endpoint in ( T ). This means that the drawn graph must be a bipartite graph. Step 2: Ensure Unique Partitioning We first show that partitioning the five points into the sets ( S ) and ( T ) according to the given conditions can be done in only one unique way. Assume we can partition the points into ( S cup T ) and ( S' cup T' ). Then define: - ( A = S' cap S ) - ( B = S' cap T ) - ( C = T' cap S ) - ( D = T' cap T ) Since ( S, T ) and ( S', T' ) are partitions of the points, the sets ( A, B, C, D ) also partition the points. Given the second condition: - Only segments between ( S ) and ( T ) are allowed. - Only segments between ( S' ) and ( T' ) are allowed. Thus, possible segments must be between points in ( A ) and ( D ), or between points in ( B ) and ( C ). Since the graph is connected (first condition), it must be that either ( A = D = varnothing ) or ( B = C = varnothing ): - If ( A = D = varnothing ), it follows ( S' = T ) and ( T' = S ). - If ( B = C = varnothing ), then ( S' = S ) and ( T' = T ). Thus, in both cases, ( S, T ) and ( S', T' ) must represent the same partitioning. Step 3: Count Possible Sets of Segments Now we count all possible ways to draw segments concerning sets ( S ) and ( T ): # Case 1: Sets Contain 4 Points and 1 Point - There are ( binom{5}{1} = 5 ) ways to make this partition. - The sole point in its own set must connect to each of the other 4 points. - There is only 1 possible set of segments in each case. This results in: [ 5 times 1 = 5 text{ possible sets of segments in this case.} ] # Case 2: Sets Contain 3 Points and 2 Points - There are ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ) ways to make this partition. Let's consider all potential degrees of points in ( T ) (set with 2 points): 1. **Both Points Have Degree 3:** - Each point in ( T ) is connected to all points in ( S ), ensuring connectivity. - Only 1 possible set of segments. 2. **Points Have Degrees 3 and 2:** - Two ways to assign degrees to the points. - The point with degree 2 has ( binom{3}{2} = 3 ) choices of connections. - Total: ( 2 times 3 = 6 ) ways. 3. **Points Have Degrees 3 and 1:** - Two ways to assign degrees. - The point with degree 1 has ( binom{3}{1} = 3 ) choices of connections. - Total: ( 2 times 3 = 6 ) ways. 4. **Both Points Have Degree 2:** - Two ways to choose a common point in ( S ) and three ways to choose this common point, the rest are paired. - Total: ( 2 times 3 = 6 ) ways. 5. **Points Have Degrees 2 and 1:** - The total ways given connectivity issues are zero. 6. **Both Points Have Degree 1:** - Total ways given connectivity issues are zero. Summing these, from the conditions, we get: [ 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 19 text{ possible sets of segments for each partition.} ] With 10 partitions possible, [ 10 times 19 = 190 text{ possible sets of segments in this case.} ] # Step 4: Summing All Possibilities Combining with the 5 sets from case 1, [ 190 + 5 = 195 ] # Conclusion Therefore, the number of sets of segments that meet the given conditions is: [ boxed{195} ] \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Abigail built 10 fences.

This is essentially an application of Ramsey Theory. 2. **Graph Representation**: Let the 6 people be represented by vertices ( A, B, C, D, E, F ).

A: There is generally no direct correlation between a student's grades and their weight; these two variables can be independent of each other. B: For an object moving at a constant velocity in a straight line, the displacement is a direct function of time, such that d = vt, where d is displacement, v is velocity, and t is time. This represents a functional relationship, not merely a correlative one. C: The volume and weight of water are directly related through density; given that the density of water is relatively constant, weight can be expressed as a function of volume. Again, this is a functional relationship, where w = rho v, with w being weight, rho being density, and v being volume. D: The number of fatigued drivers on the road and the occurrence of traffic accidents is a correlative relationship. As the number of fatigued drivers increases, the likelihood of traffic accidents occurring also increases, although this is not a deterministic function as many other factors play a role in traffic accidents.

Prove that a sequence of moves cannot be infinite.","completion":"1. **Monovariant: Product of Numbers** Consider the product of all numbers on the board. Let (a, b, c) be any three numbers on the board that we use to make a move. By Ravi substitution, we can write (a = x + y), (b = y + z), and (c = z + x) for some positive integers (x, y, z). The new numbers after the move are (a + b - c), (b + c - a), and (c + a - b). We need to show that the product of these new numbers is strictly less than the product of the original numbers. [ (a + b - c)(b + c - a)(c + a - b) = (x + y + y + z - (z + x))(y + z + z + x - (x + y))(z + x + x + y - (y + z)) ] Simplifying, we get: [ (2y)(2z)(2x) = 8xyz ] By the AM-GM inequality, we have: [ 8xyz leq (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = abc ] Equality holds if and only if (x = y = z), which implies (a = b = c). Since we cannot use (a = b = c) (as it would not form a non-equilateral triangle), the product is strictly decreasing. Since all numbers on the board are positive integers, the product also remains an integer. Thus, it decreases by at least 1 each move and will eventually reach non-positivity, assuming there was an infinite sequence of moves. This is a contradiction. 2. **Monovariant: Largest Number, Invariant: Sum of Numbers** We'll proceed by induction. **Base case:** For (n = 3), take the numbers (a, b, c). Let (a geq b geq c). Then (a + b - c geq a). If (b neq c), then (a + b - c geq a + 1). Otherwise, we get the numbers (a, 2b - a, a). A move on that turn will give us (a + a - (2b - a) = 3a - 2b > a), since we cannot have (a = b = c). Thus, the maximum is strictly increasing. But the sum of the numbers on the board stays constant, say (S := a + b + c). Therefore, the maximum will eventually reach (frac{a + b + c}{2}). By the triangle inequality, the three numbers on the board don't form a triangle anymore. Thus, we cannot have an infinite sequence of moves for (n = 3). **Induction Hypothesis:** There is no infinite sequence of moves for (n) numbers on the board. **Induction Step:** Assume otherwise. Let (a_1, a_2, dots, a_{n+1}) be the starting numbers. Then (S := a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_{n+1}) is invariant. Now look at (a := max(a_1, a_2, dots, a_{n+1})). Either, somewhen, by doing moves, there will be a number larger than (a), then the maximum increases. Or assume (a) would stay the largest. Somewhen, there has to be a move involving (a), since there is no infinite sequence of moves with only the other (n) numbers due to the Induction Hypothesis. Let (a geq b geq c) be three numbers that represent the first move involving (a). That gives us (a + b - c, b + c - a, c + a - b). The only possibility that the maximum doesn't increase would be if (b = c). That then produces two copies of (a), though. By a similar argument, we will have a move involving (a) again. If the maximum does not increase, we'd produce another copy of (a). So the maximum has to increase sometime, else we'd end up with (a_1 = a_2 = dots = a_{n+1} = a) with which the sequence of moves would terminate. Now as the maximum increases, that maximum will eventually reach (frac{S}{2}). By the triangle inequality, the maximum then does not form a triangle with any two other numbers, thus the set of moves can then only involve the other (n) numbers. But by the Induction Hypothesis, it'll terminate.

(2) First, find omega by substituting z=1+2i into the equation omega= frac {z}{1-2i}.

From the equation (2d - 1 = x^2), we can see that x^2 must be odd because 1 subtracted from an even number 2d is odd. Since (x^2) is odd, x must also be odd. Let x = 2n - 1 for some integer n. Substituting this in, we get: [ 2d - 1 = (2n - 1)^2. ] Expanding the square: [ 2d - 1 = 4n^2 - 4n + 1. ] Adding 1 to both sides: [ 2d = 4n^2 - 4n + 2. ] Dividing through by 2: [ d = 2n^2 - 2n + 1. ] Hence, d is also an odd number. 3. From the equations (5d - 1 = y^2) and (13d - 1 = z^2), we observe that both y^2 and z^2 need to be of the form 4k because 5 and 13 are odd and the terms (5d-1) and (13d-1) involve multiples of (4).

Since d is odd, let’s consider the terms q - p and q + p. Since they are both even (because q and p are integers), their product (q - p)(q + p) is divisible by 4. However, on the left-hand side of the equation 2d = q^2 - p^2, the term 2d is divisible by 2 but not necessarily by 4 (as d is odd). This leads to a contradiction because (2d) is not divisible by 4 while (q^2 - p^2) is applicable to a 4k multiple property. 6. This contradiction arises because we assumed that all quantities 2d-1, 5d-1, and 13d-1 are perfect squares. Thus, our assumption must be wrong, which means at least one of these quantities cannot be a perfect square.

When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: (1/10) + (1/15) = (3/30) + (2/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 of the job per hour. So, working together, they can complete 1/6 of the job in one hour.

The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the molecule. The atomic masses of hydrogen (H), carbon (C), and oxygen (O) are approximately: - H: 1.01 g/mol - C: 12.01 g/mol - O: 16.00 g/mol Now, let's calculate the molar mass of acetylsalicylic acid: Molar mass of C9H8O4 = (9 × atomic mass of C) + (8 × atomic mass of H) + (4 × atomic mass of O) = (9 × 12.01 g/mol) + (8 × 1.01 g/mol) + (4 × 16.00 g/mol) = 108.09 g/mol + 8.08 g/mol + 64.00 g/mol = 180.17 g/mol Next, we calculate the mass percentage of each element: Mass percentage of H = (total atomic mass of H in the molecule / molar mass of the molecule) × 100% = (8 × 1.01 g/mol) / 180.17 g/mol × 100% = 8.08 g/mol / 180.17 g/mol × 100% = 4.48% Mass percentage of C = (total atomic mass of C in the molecule / molar mass of the molecule) × 100% = (9 × 12.01 g/mol) / 180.17 g/mol × 100% = 108.09 g/mol / 180.17 g/mol × 100% = 60.00% Mass percentage of O = (total atomic mass of O in the molecule / molar mass of the molecule) × 100% = (4 × 16.00 g/mol) / 180.17 g/mol × 100% = 64.00 g/mol / 180.17 g/mol × 100% = 35.52% Therefore, the mass percentages of H, C, and O in acetylsalicylic acid are approximately: - H: 4.48% - C: 60.00% - O: boxed{35.52%}"},{"prompt":"A train 145 m long is traveling at 45 km/hr and can cross a bridge of 230 m in a certain amount of time.

This distance is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. Total distance = Length of the train + Length of the bridge Total distance = 145 m + 230 m Total distance = 375 m Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s) because the distance is in meters and we want the time in seconds. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 375 m / 12.5 m/s Time = 30 seconds Therefore, it takes the train boxed{30} seconds to cross the bridge."},{"prompt":"Determine the value of cos ^{2}75^{circ}+cos ^{2}15^{circ}+cos 75^{circ}cdotcos 15^{circ}.

Next, we apply the Pythagorean identity, sin^{2}(theta) + cos^{2}(theta) = 1, to the first two terms, yielding: 1 + sin(15^circ)cos(15^circ). Now, we use the double-angle identity for sine, sin(2theta) = 2sin(theta)cos(theta), and solve for sin(15^circ)cos(15^circ) = frac{1}{2}sin(30^circ).

The second item costs 200% of the first item, which is 50. So, the cost of the second item is: 200% of 50 = 2 * 50 = 100 Next, let's calculate the cost of the third item. The third item costs 150% of the second item, which is 100. So, the cost of the third item is: 150% of 100 = 1.5 * 100 = 150 Now, let's calculate the percentage increase from the first item's cost to the third item's cost. The increase is the difference between the third item's cost and the first item's cost, which is 150 - 50 = 100. To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original amount (the cost of the first item) and multiply by 100: Percentage increase = (100 / 50) * 100 = 2 * 100 = 200% So, the percentage increase from the first item's cost to the third item's cost is 200%.

Here is a step-by-step explanation: - The first plane divides the space into two regions. - The second plane, being parallel to the first, further divides each of those two regions, resulting in four regions. - The third plane, also parallel, does not increase the number of regions because it only divides one of the four pre-existing regions into two, keeping the total count at four. 2. **Case 2: All three planes intersect along a single line.** If the planes all intersect each other along a single line, each plane introduction will create additional regions in the space. They divide the space into six regions. To understand this, consider: - The first plane divides the space into two regions. - The second plane cuts these two regions and adds two more, totaling four regions. - The third plane, intersecting along the same line, cuts across all four existing regions, adding two more to make six regions. 3. **Case 3: The planes intersect pairwise along three individual lines.** In the scenario where each plane intersects with the other two along three distinct lines, the space is divided into seven regions. Analyzing this case step by step: - The first plane divides space into two regions. - The second plane intersects with the first to create four regions. - The third plane intersects with both previous planes, but since the intersection lines do not concur, it adds three more regions to the existing four, hence seven in total. 4. **Case 4: Two planes intersect and the third cuts across both.** When two planes intersect and the third plane intersects both of these planes but not at the intersection line of the first two, the space is divided into eight regions. We describe the process as follows: - The first plane divides the space into two regions. - The second plane intersects with the first to create four regions. - The third plane intersects both of the preceding planes in such a way that it doesn’t pass through their intersection line, adding four more regions, which results in a total of eight regions. Therefore, depending on the spatial relationship between the planes, the number of regions can be boxed{4}, boxed{6}, boxed{7}, or boxed{8}.

There are 3 ways to do this (seats 1 and 3, seats 1 and 4, seats 2 and 4). 2. **Both people sit in the back row**: Similarly, for the back row with 5 seats, there are 4 ways to choose 2 non-adjacent seats (seats 1 and 3, seats 1 and 4, seats 1 and 5, seats 2 and 4, seats 2 and 5, seats 3 and 5). 3. **One person in the front row and one person in the back row**: Since they are not adjacent by default in this scenario, we can simply multiply the number of choices in the front row by the number of choices in the back row. That is 4 times 5 = 20 ways. Adding all these scenarios together, we get 3 + 4 + 20 = 27 ways. However, we need to consider that each arrangement can be swapped between the two people, doubling the number of arrangements. Therefore, the total number of different seating arrangements is 27 times 2 = 54 ways. However, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation above. The correct approach should consider the correct number of ways to choose non-adjacent seats in both rows and the scenario where one person is in the front row and the other is in the back row correctly.

According to the problem, the trip would have taken 1 hour less if the speed had been 5 miles per hour faster.

Prove that ( triangle A_1 B_1 C_1 ) has an area greater than or equal to ( triangle ABC ). 1. Let's consider the internal angle bisectors of ( triangle ABC ) meeting at the incenter ( I ). The angle bisectors intersect the sides of ( triangle ABC ) at points ( D, E, F ). 2. Define ( A_0, B_0, C_0 ) as the points where the angle bisectors of ( triangle ABC ) meet the opposite sides. For example, ( A_0 ) is where the angle bisector of ( angle A ) meets ( BC ). Similarly, define ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) as the points where the internal bisectors meet the excircle of ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Step 1**: Identify the points where the bisectors meet the excircle. - ( A_1 ) is where the angle bisector from ( A ) meets the excircle. - ( B_1 ) is where the angle bisector from ( B ) meets the excircle. - ( C_1 ) is where the angle bisector from ( C ) meets the excircle. 4. **Step 2**: Establish the relationships using symmetry. - From the properties of the excircle and angle bisectors, we know that ( A_0A = A_1I ) and ( C_1C_0 = C_1I ). - It follows that ( A_1 C_1 parallel A_0 C_0 ). 5. **Step 3**: Calculate the area relations. - We know that the smaller triangle formed by these bisectors in the center, ( triangle A_{1}B_{1}I ), is one-fourth the area of ( triangle A_0B_0I ). - Thus, ( S_{triangle A_{1}B_{1}I} = frac{1}{4} S_{triangle A_0B_0I} ). 6. **Step 4**: Derive the area relations for the triangles. - Given that each segment of the form ( A_1A_0 ), ( B_1B_0 ), etc., maintains a proportional relationship with ( I ) being the center, the area relationships carry through a similar one-fourth ratio for each corresponding larger triangle relation. - Hence, ( S_{triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}} = frac{1}{4} S_{triangle A_0B_0C_0} ). 7.

First Approach:** 1. Consider points ( E ) and ( F ) as interior points on segments ( B C ) and ( C D ), respectively. This implies that line ( D E ) is not parallel to ( A B ) (let their intersection be ( M )), and ( G ) is an interior point on segment ( A B ), as it is the central reflection of ( F ) across the midpoint of the parallelogram ( A B C D ). Finally, point ( H ) is distinct from all previously mentioned points. (See Figure 1) 2. By considering lines ( M A ) and ( M D ) intersected by two pairs of parallel lines (( A D, B C )) and by understanding the similar triangles formed, we have: [ frac{E M}{B M} = frac{D M}{A M} ] which implies: [ A M cdot E M = D M cdot B M ] Additionally, considering the transversal lines ( B F ) and ( D G ): [ G M cdot H M = D M cdot B M ] Equating the right-hand sides: [ A M cdot E M = G M cdot H M implies frac{A M}{G M} = frac{H M}{E M} ] 3. By the converse of the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem), this relation indicates that lines ( A H ) and ( G E ) are parallel. This proves the statement. 4. In the special case where ( E ) or ( F ) lies at the endpoints of the segments ( B C ) or ( C D ), point ( H ) coincides with one of the points ( B, C, D, E, ) or ( F ), thus making the statement trivial or indeterminate. 5. For points ( E ) and ( F ) lying on the extensions of ( B C ) and ( C D ), if ( D E ) and ( B F ) are not parallel, the theorem can be similarly proved. # Conclusion: ( blacksquare ) **II. Second Approach:** 1. Let ( overrightarrow{A B} = mathbf{a} ) and ( overrightarrow{A D} = mathbf{b} ). Any vector in the plane can be expressed using ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ). Choose points ( E ) and ( F ) on ( B C ) and ( C D ) such that ( overrightarrow{E C} = lambda mathbf{b} ) and ( overrightarrow{F C} = kappa mathbf{a} ) with ( lambda, kappa in [0, 1] ). 2. We have: [ begin{aligned} overrightarrow{A G} &= overrightarrow{F C} overrightarrow{G B} &= (1-kappa) mathbf{a} overrightarrow{B E} &= (1-lambda) mathbf{b} end{aligned} ] Thus: [ overrightarrow{G E} = overrightarrow{G B} + overrightarrow{B E} = (1 - kappa) mathbf{a} + (1 - lambda) mathbf{b} ] 3. For vector ( overrightarrow{A H} ): [ overrightarrow{B F} = overrightarrow{B C} + overrightarrow{C F} = mathbf{b} - kappa mathbf{a} ] Since ( H ) lies on ( B F ), there exists a scalar ( alpha_1 ) such that: [ overrightarrow{B H} = alpha_1 (mathbf{b} - kappa mathbf{a}) implies overrightarrow{A H} = overrightarrow{A B} + overrightarrow{B H} = (1 - kappa alpha_1) mathbf{a} + alpha_1 mathbf{b} ] Similarly, for ( overrightarrow{D E} ): [ overrightarrow{D E} = mathbf{a} - lambda mathbf{b} ] Since ( H ) lies on ( D E ), there exists a scalar ( alpha_2 ) such that: [ overrightarrow{D H} = alpha_2 (mathbf{a} - lambda mathbf{b}) implies overrightarrow{A H} = overrightarrow{A D} + overrightarrow{D H} = alpha_2 mathbf{a} + (1 - lambda alpha_2) mathbf{b} ] 4. Setting the two expressions of ( overrightarrow{A H} ) equal, we get: [ begin{aligned} 1 - kappa alpha_1 &= alpha_2 alpha_1 &= 1 - lambda alpha_2 end{aligned} ] Solving the system: [ begin{aligned} kappa alpha_1 + alpha_2 &= 1 alpha_1 + lambda alpha_2 &= 1 end{aligned} implies alpha_1 = frac{1 - lambda}{1 - kappa lambda}, quad alpha_2 = frac{1 - kappa}{1 - kappa lambda} ] Using these values, we can rewrite: [ overrightarrow{A H} = left( frac{(1 - kappa) mathbf{a} + (1 - lambda) mathbf{b}}{1 - kappa lambda} right) = mu cdot overrightarrow{G E} ] where ( mu ) is a scalar dependent on ( kappa ) and ( lambda ). Thus ( overrightarrow{A H} ) is parallel to ( overrightarrow{G E} ). 5. If ( E ) and ( F ) are chosen outside ( B C ) and ( C D ), ( kappa lambda ) might equal 1, leading to ( H ) being indeterminate.

Next, we attempt to decompose the product (n^{4}(n + 1)) into a more manageable form. Rewriting (n^{5} + n^{4}), we can factor the expression as follows: [ n^{5} + n^{4} = n^{4}(n + 1) = (n^{3} - n + 1)(n^{2} + n + 1) ] Therefore, we reduce our equation to: [ (n^{3} - n + 1)(n^{2} + n + 1) = 7^{m} ] At this point, we note that (7^m) is a power of 7. Thus both factors on the left side must be factors of 7. Since (n^{3} - n + 1) and (n^{2} + n + 1) are both greater than 1 for ( n geq 2), they should collectively multiply to ( 7^m ).

This reduces to: [ 7^{a} times 7^{b} = 7^{m} ] Or: [ a + b = m ] By properties of divisors of powers, we know that: [ (7^b - 1) mid (7^a - 1) ] This implies that ( 7^a - 1 ) must also be divisible by ( 7^b - 1 ), meaning ( a ) and ( b ) must be appropriate factors, but upon verifying manually: For higher ( n geq 3 ), no appropriate values for ( a ) and ( b ) making: [ n^{3} - n + 1 = 7^a ] [ n^{2} + n + 1 = 7^b ] matches without contradictions.

Since the symmetric circle has the same radius as the original circle, which is sqrt{5}, and its center is at (0,-2), the equation of the symmetric circle can be written using the standard form of a circle's equation centered at (h, k) with radius r: (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. Substitute h=0, k=-2, and r=sqrt{5} into the equation, we obtain: (x-0)^2 + (y-(-2))^2 = 5.

Consequently, it is also divisible by (4ab - 1). 4. **Interchangeability of Good Pairs**: Since (a^2) and (4ab-1) are coprime, it follows that if ((a, b)) is a good pair, then ((b, a)) is also a good pair. 5. **Trivial Good Pairs**: Among good pairs, there are trivial pairs, those of the form ((a, a)). 6. **Defining Bad Numbers**: Define a number (a) as bad if it is part of a non-trivial good pair.

This angle inconsistency indicates that when the sections are reassembled, they do not align perfectly into a straight-line diagonal configuration. 4. **Conclusion of Geometric Inconsistency:** The mismatch in angles (alpha > beta) shows that the newly formed figure in the second diagram does not have a perfectly straight diagonal, but rather a slightly zigzagged or bent diagonal path. This creates a minute gap or overlap in the second arrangement. 5. **Resulting in Discrepancy of Area:** Consequently, the difference in the alignment leads to a very slight discrepancy in area calculations, although this difference is theoretically very small, on a discrete graph paper the misalignment results in the extra small square. Hence, the perceived additional square calculated is due to this geometric configuration error.

In an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, the altitude AA_1 drawn from vertex A to the base BC is also the median and the angle bisector, making A_1 the midpoint of BC. 4. Since A_1 is the midpoint of BC, segments A_1B and A_1C are equal. Specifically, A_1B = A_1C. 5. Therefore, |A_1B - A_1C| = |A_1B - A_1B| = 0. 6.

We can express the number of students in the third group as: (3/4) * (x + 5) Now, we know that the total number of students, T, is the sum of the students in all three groups: T = x + (x + 5) + (3/4) * (x + 5) Since we know that x = 1/4 * T, we can substitute this value into the equation: T = (1/4 * T) + ((1/4 * T) + 5) + (3/4) * ((1/4 * T) + 5) Now, let's solve for T: T = (1/4 * T) + (1/4 * T + 5) + (3/4) * (1/4 * T + 5) T = (1/4 * T) + (1/4 * T) + 5 + (3/4) * (1/4 * T) + (3/4) * 5 T = (1/4 * T) + (1/4 * T) + (3/16 * T) + 5 + (15/4) Now, let's combine like terms: T = (1/4 * T) + (1/4 * T) + (3/16 * T) + (20/4) T = (2/4 * T) + (3/16 * T) + 5 T = (8/16 * T) + (3/16 * T) + 5 T = (11/16 * T) + 5 Now, to solve for T, we need to isolate T on one side of the equation: T - (11/16 * T) = 5 (16/16 * T) - (11/16 * T) = 5 (5/16 * T) = 5 Now, we divide both sides by (5/16) to solve for T: T = 5 / (5/16) T = 5 * (16/5) T = 16 So, there are boxed{16} students in Buddy's gym class in total."},{"prompt":"Given positive numbers a and b satisfying a+b=2, find the minimum value of frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}.","completion":"Given positive numbers a and b satisfying a+b=2, we aim to find the minimum value of frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}. We start by using the given condition a+b=2 and manipulate the expression frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b} as follows: begin{align*} frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b} &= frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}right)(a+b) &= frac{1}{2}left(frac{a}{a}+frac{b}{b}+frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}right) &= frac{1}{2}left(2+frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}right). end{align*} Next, we apply the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative numbers x and y, we have frac{x+y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}, with equality if and only if x=y.

Given the original intensity of the light is a, and each time the light passes through a piece of glass, its intensity becomes 90% of the original. Therefore, after passing through n pieces of glass, the intensity becomes 2^n times the original.

Determine the value of B and find a and c when b=2 and the area of triangle ABC is sqrt{3}.","completion":"To solve the problem, we proceed in two main steps: **Step 1: Finding the value of B** Given that a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides opposite to the internal angles A, B, and C of triangle triangle ABC, and b=2, we aim to find the value of B under three different conditions. - **Condition ①**: We start with the identity sin(A+B) = sin(pi - C) = sin C. This leads us to the equation (a-c)sin C = (a-b)(sin A + sin B). Applying the Law of Sines, we get (a-c)c = (a-b)(a+b). This simplifies to cos B = frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2ac} = frac{1}{2}. Given that 0 < B < pi, we find B = frac{pi}{3}. - **Condition ②**: We have the equation sin^2B - cos^2B + 2sqrt{3}sin Bcos B = 2. Applying trigonometric identities, this simplifies to sqrt{3}sin 2B - cos 2B = 2, which further simplifies to 2sin(2B - frac{pi}{6}) = 2. Thus, sin(2B - frac{pi}{6}) = 1. Given that 0 < B < pi, we find 2B - frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2}, which gives B = frac{pi}{3}. - **Condition ③**: We start with the equation bcos C = a - frac{sqrt{3}}{3}csin B. This leads to 3sin Bcos C = 3sin A - sqrt{3}sin Csin B. Simplifying, we get 3sin Bcos C = 3sin(B+C) - sqrt{3}sin Csin B. This simplifies to 3cos Bsin C = sqrt{3}sin Csin B, which leads to tan B = sqrt{3}. Given that 0 < B < pi, we find B = frac{pi}{3}. Thus, under all conditions, we have B = frac{pi}{3}. **Step 2: Finding the values of a and c** Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC, we have b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2accos B = (a+c)^2 - 3ac = 4. Also, the area of triangle ABC is given by frac{1}{2}acsin B = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}ac = sqrt{3}, which implies ac = 4. Solving these equations, we find: - From the area condition, ac = 4. - Substituting b = 2 and B = frac{pi}{3} into the Law of Cosines equation, we get (a+c)^2 - 3ac = 4. Given ac = 4, we substitute into the equation to find a and c. Solving, we find a = c = 2. Therefore, the values of B, a, and c are B = frac{pi}{3}, a = 2, and c = 2 respectively.

This is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as (x - 2)^2 = 0. Therefore, the roots of the equation are both a = 2 and b = 2. If a certain value is 8, we need to find an expression involving the roots a and b that equals 8. Since a and b are both equal to 2, we can consider the sum of the roots, the product of the roots, or any other combination that might yield the value 8. The sum of the roots is given by a + b, which in this case is 2 + 2 = 4. This is not the value we are looking for. The product of the roots is given by ab, which in this case is 2 * 2 = 4. This is also not the value we are looking for. However, if we consider the square of the sum of the roots, we get (a + b)^2. Substituting the values of a and b, we get (2 + 2)^2 = (4)^2 = 16. This is not the value we are looking for either. Since the roots are equal and the sum and product of the roots do not give us the value 8, we can try an expression that involves a constant multiple of the roots. For example, if we take 2 times the sum of the roots, we get 2(a + b) = 2(2 + 2) = 2(4) = 8.

Hence, for systematic sampling, the numbers of the selected individuals form an arithmetic sequence starting at 3 (the first number chosen) with a common difference of 12. The general term for this arithmetic sequence is given by the formula a_n = 3 + 12(n-1) = 12n - 9. Now, we must determine how many individuals fall into the interval [496, 600] for survey C. We can set up the inequalities based on the general term of the sequence: 496 le 12n - 9 le 600. Reformulating these inequalities to isolate n, we get: 505 le 12n le 609. Dividing by 12 to solve for n, the inequalities become: frac{505}{12} le n le frac{609}{12}. Simplifying those, we have: 42frac{1}{12} le n le 50frac{3}{4}.

A certain brand of chalk is sold by the whole box, with each box containing 20 boxes. Based on past experience, there may be some boxes of chalk that are nonhighquality products, while the rest are highquality products. The probabilities of a box containing 0, 1, or 2 boxes of nonhighquality chalk are 0.7, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively. In order to purchase chalk from this brand, the school's general affairs teacher has designed a purchasing plan: to buy a box of chalk, randomly check 4 boxes of chalk in the box, and if there are no nonhighquality products, then purchase, otherwise do not purchase. Let event A be buying the box of chalk that was checked, and event B_{i} (where i=0,1,2) be there are i nonhighquality products in the box. (1) Find P(A|B_{0}), P(A|B_{1}), P(A|B_{2}). (2) Randomly check four boxes of chalk from a box of this brand. Let X be the number of nonhighquality products.

Thus, regardless of which 4 boxes are checked, they will all be of high quality, leading to: [ P(A|B_{0}) = 1 ] - For B_1 (1 non-high-quality product), the probability of buying the box after checking 4 boxes, P(A|B_{1}), can be seen as the chance of choosing 4 high-quality boxes out of the available 19 high-quality ones out of a total of 20 boxes. Therefore: [ P(A|B_{1}) = frac{C_{19}^{4}}{C_{20}^{4}} = frac{4}{5} ] - For B_2 (2 non-high-quality products), the probability of buying, P(A|B_{2}), involves choosing 4 boxes out of the 18 high-quality ones from a total of 20 boxes, which gives: [ P(A|B_{2}) = frac{C_{18}^{4}}{C_{20}^{4}} = frac{12}{19} ] Therefore, summarizing the conditional probabilities, we have: - P(A|B_{0}) = 1 - P(A|B_{1}) = frac{4}{5} - P(A|B_{2}) = frac{12}{19} Part 2: Finding the Probability Distribution of X To find the probability distribution of X, where X is the number of non-high-quality products found upon checking 4 boxes: - For X=0, we consider all scenarios where no non-high-quality products are found.

If the matching sock to the distinctly marked one is at the first position (probability of this is (frac{1}{2n-1})), a pair cannot be formed. Therefore, (p_{2, n} = 0). 2.

We need to scrutinize the sequence defined by the transformation rule: if the current number is ( x ), then the next number is ( frac{1}{1-x} ). The first number in the sequence is 2. 2. We will compute a few terms to identify any pattern or periodicity in the sequence: - Start with the first term: ( a_1 = 2 ) - Compute the second term: [ a_2 = frac{1}{1 - a_1} = frac{1}{1 - 2} = frac{1}{-1} = -1 ] - Compute the third term: [ a_3 = frac{1}{1 - a_2} = frac{1}{1 - (-1)} = frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} ] - Compute the fourth term: [ a_4 = frac{1}{1 - a_3} = frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 2 ] 3. Observing the terms, we notice that the sequence starts repeating itself with a period of 3: [ 2, -1, frac{1}{2}, 2, -1, frac{1}{2}, ldots ] 4. To find the 500th term in the sequence, we use the fact that the sequence has a period of 3. Therefore, we need to determine the position of the 500th term within one cycle of 3 terms. 5.

Let O be the center of the circle omega, and M be the intersection point of the lines AB and CD. Since the angle angle ABC = 135^circ , we can calculate the angle angle AOC using the fact that O is the center of the circle: angle AOC = 2 times (180^circ - angle ABC) = 2 times (180^circ - 135^circ) = 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ. 2. Notice that angle AOC = 90^circ means that quadrilateral AOCD is a cyclic quadrilateral where one of its angles (angle AOC) is a right angle. Therefore, quadrilateral AOC D must be a square. Consequently, each angle of this square, including angle ADC, is 90^circ. Since quadrilateral AOCD is a square: angle ADC = 90^circ. 3. By the tangent-secant theorem, also known as the Power of a Point Theorem, for point M: DM^2 = MC^2 = BM cdot AM. Given the problem condition that AB bisects CD at M, it follows that: frac{DM}{AM} = frac{BM}{DM}. 4. Based on these proportions, triangles triangle DBM and triangle ADM are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. Since triangle DBM sim triangle ADM: angle ABD = angle 180^circ - angle MBD. 5. Since quadrilateral AOC D is a square, the angles at point D are right angles: angle MBD = angle ADM = 90^circ.

On the other hand, when another number y is divided by 50, the remainder is 6. If the sum of these two numbers is divided by 8, what is the remainder?","completion":"Let's first find the general form of the numbers x and y. For x, when it is divided by 72, the remainder is 19. This means that x can be expressed as: x = 72k + 19 where k is some integer. For y, when it is divided by 50, the remainder is 6. This means that y can be expressed as: y = 50m + 6 where m is some integer. Now, we want to find the remainder when the sum of x and y is divided by 8. Let's first find the sum of x and y: x + y = (72k + 19) + (50m + 6) = 72k + 50m + 25 Now, we want to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 8. To do this, we can look at the remainder when each part of the sum is divided by 8. First, let's consider the terms with k and m. Since 72 is divisible by 8 (72 = 8 * 9), any multiple of 72 will also be divisible by 8, so 72k will leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 8. Similarly, 50m can be broken down into (48m + 2m), where 48m is divisible by 8, leaving a remainder of 0, and 2m will leave a remainder depending on the value of m. However, since we are only interested in the remainder, we can ignore the multiples of 8 and focus on the remainders. Now, let's consider the constant term 25. When 25 is divided by 8, the remainder is 1 (since 25 = 8 * 3 + 1). So, the remainder when the sum (x + y) is divided by 8 is the sum of the remainders of its parts. Since 72k and 50m leave a remainder of 0, we only need to consider the remainder of 25, which is 1. Therefore, the remainder when the sum of x and y is divided by 8 is boxed{1} ."},{"prompt":"As p ranges over the primes greater than 5, how many different remainders can p^2 leave upon division by 180?","completion":"The prime factorization of 180 is 180 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5.

Consequently, (5m pm 1)^2 equiv 1 pmod{5}, and (5m pm 2)^2 equiv 4 pmod{5}. Combining these results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem: - For (1, 1, 1), we use x equiv 1 pmod{4}, x equiv 1 pmod{9}, x equiv 1 pmod{5}: solving this system, x equiv 1 pmod{180}. - For (1, 1, 4), we use x equiv 1 pmod{4}, x equiv 1 pmod{9}, x equiv 4 pmod{5}: solving this, x equiv 64 pmod{180}.

This can be done by choosing ( x, y, z ) such that their squares modulo 3 add up to 0.

We need to find the natural number ( A ) such that there are ( A ) integer solutions to the inequality ( x + y geq A ) where ( 0 leq x leq 6 ) and ( 0 leq y leq 7 ). 2. Let's consider the total number of integer pairs ((x, y)) that satisfy the given constraints. The total number of pairs is: [ (6 - 0 + 1) times (7 - 0 + 1) = 7 times 8 = 56 ] 3. We need to count the number of pairs ((x, y)) that satisfy ( x + y geq A ). To do this, we will count the number of pairs that do not satisfy the inequality ( x + y < A ) and subtract this from the total number of pairs. 4. For a given ( A ), the pairs ((x, y)) that satisfy ( x + y < A ) form a triangular region in the coordinate plane. The number of such pairs is given by the sum of the first ( A-1 ) integers: [ sum_{k=0}^{A-1} k = frac{(A-1)A}{2} ] 5. We need to find ( A ) such that the number of pairs satisfying ( x + y geq A ) is equal to ( A ). Therefore, we need: [ 56 - frac{(A-1)A}{2} = A ] 6. Solving the equation: [ 56 - frac{(A-1)A}{2} = A ] [ 56 = A + frac{(A-1)A}{2} ] [ 56 = A + frac{A^2 - A}{2} ] [ 112 = 2A + A^2 - A ] [ A^2 + A - 112 = 0 ] 7.

Let's extend one of the longer bases of the trapezoid to meet the side of the square at point (N). Since the trapezoid is isosceles, angles formed with the square sides are each (45^circ), which makes (triangle NOS) isosceles right-angled. 4.

This is because if ( q_i equiv q_j pmod{p} ) for ( i neq j ), then ( p_i equiv p_j pmod{p} ), which contradicts the fact that ( p_i ) are distinct primes. 2. **Condition for common elements:** - For a given ( a ) and ( b ), there exists at most one index ( i ) such that ( q_i equiv aq_i + b pmod{p} ). This can be seen by solving the equation ( q_i equiv aq_i + b pmod{p} ), which simplifies to ( q_i (a - 1) equiv b pmod{p} ).

Since her mother is half her grandfather's age, we can calculate her age as follows: Mother's age = Grandfather's age ÷ 2 Mother's age = 84 years ÷ 2 Mother's age = 42 years Now, let's find out the age of Rachel's father. Since he is 5 years older than her mother, we can calculate his age as follows: Father's age = Mother's age + 5 years Father's age = 42 years + 5 years Father's age = 47 years Finally, let's determine how old Rachel's father will be when she is 25 years old.

This implies that (n^5 - n) will end with a zero and hence is divisible by 10 (which is (2 times 5)). Here's why: - For any integer (n), both (n) and (n^5) share the same units digit because a number raised to any positive power greater than one still retains its last digit. - So, (n^5 - n) ends in a zero, indicating divisibility by both 2 and 5. 2. **Divisibility by 3:** Let’s factorize (n^5 - n): We start by writing: [ n^5 - n = n(n^4 - 1) ] And further factorize (n^4 - 1): [ n^4 - 1 = (n^2 - 1)(n^2 + 1) = (n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1) ] Thus, we have: [ n^5 - n = n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1) ] In the product (n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1)): - (n(n-1)(n+1)) represents three consecutive integers, one of which is always divisible by 3 (since every third number is divisible by 3). - Here’s the detailed analysis: - If (n equiv 0 pmod{3}), (n) is divisible by 3. - If (n equiv 1 pmod{3}), then (n-1) is divisible by 3. - If (n equiv 2 pmod{3}), then (n+1) is divisible by 3.

Let point ( P(x, y) ) be any point within this square, where ( 0 leq x leq 1 ) and ( 0 leq y leq 1 ). 8. **Sum of Distances:** Calculate the sum: [ PA + PB + PC + PD = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + sqrt{(1-x)^2 + y^2} + sqrt{(1-x)^2 + (1-y)^2} + sqrt{x^2 + (1-y)^2}. ] This sum can be expressed as: [ f(x, y) + f(x, 1-y). ] 9. **Lemma Application:** By applying the lemma, we get: [ f(x, y) + f(x, 1-y) leq f(0, y) + f(0, 1-y). ] 10. **Further Calculations:** Then, [ f(0, y) + f(0, 1-y) = sqrt{y^2} + sqrt{1 + y^2} + sqrt{(1-y)^2} + sqrt{1 + (1-y)^2}. ] Simplifying: [ y + sqrt{1 + y^2} + (1-y) + sqrt{1 + (1-y)^2}. ] 11. **Maximizing the Sum:** Since ( 0 leq y leq 1 ), [ y + (1 - y) + 1 + sqrt{2} = 1 + sqrt{2}. ] 12. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, we have [ PA + PB + PC + PD leq 2 + sqrt{2}. ] The equality occurs if ( P ) is at one of the vertices of the square.

Let the distances from the starting point to these selected points be denoted as (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n). The sum of these distances is (frac{n(n+1)}{2}). 2. **Avoid identical distances**: If any of the distances (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) are equal, the claim is proven since not all distances can be unique. Assume all (x_i) are different. Then, we have (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) as a permutation of (1, 2, ldots, n). 3. **Second-order distances**: Consider the distances between every second adjacent selected point.

It can only have one adjacent segment of length (n), so one segment at the end is of unit length, and the second point from this end is (n+1) units away. Further distances like (2) units long must also only have one adjacency with the (n) unit length, as adding more would not maintain uniqueness. 5. **Contradiction by limits**: This leads to a contradiction, as it limits the potential segments to only three, whereas for (n geq 4), we should have segements in larger amounts. We conclude that all segments cannot be unique if (n geq 4). 6. **Configuration and uniqueness**: Consider another approach via combination. The numbers (frac{n^2+n}{2} ) segments are divided into 2 groups - one (n-1) from first (n) points, and the other (n). This forms a contradiction since (n-1) unique distances from (1) to ( frac{n(n+1)}{2}) are larger than selections. **Conclusion**: Since (N = frac{n^2+n}{2}) segments should cover lengths, it is inherently contradictory of (n geq 4). This implies segments inherently repeat and (boxed{n le 3}). For larger (n), all segments cannot be of unique lengths.

Let the three numbers be expressed in the form: (a - r), (a), and (a + r). - In an arithmetic sequence, such a representation implies that the common difference is (r). 3. To verify if they can form a geometric sequence, we set up the condition for being consecutive terms in a geometric progression: - The middle term squared ((a^2)) should equal the product of the other two terms ((a - r)(a + r)). Hence, we write: [ a^2 = (a - r)(a + r) ] 4. Simplify the right-hand side using the difference of squares formula: [ (a - r)(a + r) = a^2 - r^2 ] 5. Equating both expressions we get: [ a^2 = a^2 - r^2 ] 6. Rearrange to find: [ 0 = -r^2 ] 7. Solving for (r), we find: [ r^2 = 0 implies r = 0 ] 8.

The number must be a multiple of 4, which means its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. 2. The sum of the digits must equal 12. To identify the largest three-digit multiple of 4, start by examining the highest three-digit numbers: 1. If we consider numbers around 998, 997, etc., their digit sums are too high. 2. The condition of divisibility by 4 restricts the options. For a larger number, check if 980 works, as it's close and divisible by 4. However, the sum of its digits is 9 + 8 = 17. 3.

(Desks are considered neighboring if they are adjacent in the same row or in the next row but directly in front of or behind one another.)","completion":"1. **Representation of Answers**: - Let's denote the two possible answers for each question as 0 and 1. This way, each set of answers can be represented by a string of six digits, either 0 or 1. 2. **Total Number of Sets**: - Since there are 6 questions, and each question has 2 possible answers, the total number of different sets of answers is (2^6 = 64). Therefore, there are exactly 64 possible combinations of answers. 3. **Construction of a Table**: - Let's represent the hall as an (8 times 8) grid of seats since the hall has precisely 64 seats arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns. 4. **Assignment of Answer Sets**: - We need to arrange these 64 sets in such a way that any two sets of answers from neighboring seats differ in at most one answer. 5. **Parity Concept**: - Define the parity of a set of answers as the parity of the sum of its digits. - We can color the cells of the table in a checkerboard pattern: white and black, such that neighboring cells are of different colors. The top-left cell (1,1) is white. 6. **Assignment Based on Parity**: - Assign even parity sets (sum of digits is even) to white cells and odd parity sets (sum of digits is odd) to black cells. - Since there are 64 sets total, half are even and half are odd, so this distribution fits perfectly. 7. **Ensuring Uniqueness and Difference**: - Now, we should demonstrate that neighboring assemblies differ by exactly one digit in their answer sets: - Consider two neighboring cells; by our coloring, one is white and one is black. - Since a white cell contains an even parity set and a black cell contains an odd parity set, they must differ by exactly one digit (changing a single digit changes the parity). 8. **Verification**: - To verify the difference in answers between neighbors: - Suppose the answer set for a cell in row (i) and column (j) is (a_{i,j}). - For (a_{i,j}) and (a_{i,j+1}) or (a_{i+1,j}) to differ by exactly one digit, they must change parity, which is ensured by our coloring scheme. 9. **Conclusion**: - By this arrangement, not only do all 64 sets uniquely appear exactly once, but also any two neighboring seats' answer sets differ in exactly one digit. Thus, it is possible that none of the answer sets are identical among the employees, and any two answer sets for neighboring seats differ by at most one answer.

Prove that Player A has a winning strategy.","completion":"To demonstrate that Player A (甲) has a winning strategy in this game, we take the following steps: 1. **Define groupings of squares:** Starting from the second square (i.e., the square labeled 2), we group every two consecutive squares as one group: [ (2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), ldots, (2k, 2k+1) ] The total number of such groups is: [ leftlfloor frac{n-1}{2} rightrfloor ] Here, the floor function (leftlfloor x rightrfloor) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to (x). 2. **Identify initial positions of the rooks:** Initially, there are three rooks placed on squares (n-2), (n-1), and (n). Since (n-2), (n-1), and (n) are consecutive numbers, at least two of the three rooks must fall within the same group of two consecutive squares as defined above. 3. **Make Player A's first move:** Player A should move the rook that belongs to the smaller group (i.e., ( (n-2, n-1) ) or ( (n-1, n) )) to square 1. This ensures that Player A places one rook in a square where it cannot be moved further. Hence, one rook is immobilized and it simplifies the game. 4. **Analyze the subsequent moves:** Following this, Player B (乙) will move one of the remaining two rooks. Regardless of which square Player B places it on (always moving it to a lower-numbered square), Player A always has the option to move the other rook into the other square of the same group. For example, if Player B moves a rook from square (x) to square (x-2k), Player A will then move another rook to a square that still maintains the strategy of keeping it within the group. 5. **Ensure Player A (甲) always has a move:** By following this strategy, Player A will always have a legal move and a rook available to move, while continually restricting Player B's options. This ensures that eventually it will become impossible for Player B to make any legal moves, resulting in a win for Player A.

This substitution is made to simplify calculations and to express a and b in terms of a single variable, making it easier to find the relationship between them and eventually the eccentricity. 3.

In simpler terms, the symmedian is the reflection of the corresponding median over the angle bisector. 2. **Given Information:** We have two pieces of information: - AD is a line segment where A and D are points in triangle ABC. - X is defined as the intersection of tangents to the circumcircle at points B and C. 3. **Symmedian in triangle ABC:** From previous problems, it's known that AX is the symmedian from A in triangle ABC. This means AX is a reflection of the median through A over the angle bisector of angle BAC. 4. **Properties of symmedians involving tangents:** A significant property of the symmedian is that the point it passes through (in this case X) is defined by the tangents to the circumcircle at the other two vertices, B and C. 5. **Generalizing for arbitrary choices:** - We note that any triangle can be transformed into another triangle by an appropriate choice of vertices and rotational symmetry. - Given A, B, C and defining X as the intersection of these tangents, we can similarly propose that if focusing on triangle DBC, the same geometrical principles hold. 6. **Observation in triangle DBC:** - In triangle DBC, let’s consider D taking the analogous role to that of A in triangle ABC. - Geometrically, DX should be the symmedian from D in triangle DBC following similar reflection principles over angle bisectors, and the relationship established with tangents forming from D. 7. **Collinearity and Conclusion:** - Given A, D, and X lie on the same line by the problem’s condition and construction (they must be collinear for the symmedian properties to be consistent). - Thus, AD is indeed aligned as the symmedian from D in triangle DBC. Therefore, line AD satisfies the condition to be the symmedian, reflecting the symmetrical properties as needed, completing the proof. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The diagonals of a rhombus are 13 cm and 20 cm.

For the product of two integers to be odd, both integers must themselves be odd. Between 5 and 17, the odd integers are 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17, totaling 7 odd integers. The number of ways to choose two odd integers from these 7, without regard to order, is: [ binom{7}{2} = frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = frac{7 times 6}{2 times 1} = 7 times 3 = 21 ] Finally, the probability that the product of two randomly chosen distinct integers from between 5 and 17 (inclusive) is odd is the ratio of the number of ways to choose two odd integers to the total number of ways to choose any two integers, which is: [ dfrac{21}{78} = dfrac{7}{26} ] Therefore, the desired probability is boxed{dfrac{7}{26}}."},{"prompt":"The negation of the proposition If a=0 and b=0, then a^2+b^2=0 is ____.","completion":"To form the negation of the original proposition \\"If a=0 and b=0, then a^2+b^2=0\\", we need to negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion.
