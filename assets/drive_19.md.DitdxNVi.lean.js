‘······미쳤네! 뭐여 이거!’ 플래시 세례에 눈이 부신 건 경험에 있었다. 최근이라면 강우진의 노빠꾸가 던져졌던 ‘남사친’의 제작발표회 때. 아니, 아니야. 여긴 그때보다 수 배는 더 요동치고 있었다. -파바바바박! -파바바바바바박!! 그때보다 카메라는 훨씬 더 많다. 강우진이 나온 입국장의 오른쪽, 줄 펜스가 저 끝까지 이어져 있고 그 공간에 기자들이 덕지덕지 붙어 있다. 얼추 백여 명. 그 뒤로 일본의 일반인들이 덮고 있는 그림. 기자들은 카메라를, 일반 구경꾼들은 죄다 핸드폰을 들고 있었다. 용도는 뭐겠는가? 500명은 넘어 보이는 인원들이 방금 등장한 강우진과 화린을 미친 듯이 찍어댄다. 여기서 재밌는 것은. “미쳤나 봐!! 꺅! 이 사람들 전부가 우리 오빠를 보러 온 거라고?!” 수백 명 구경꾼 사이 익숙한 여자가 보인다는 것. 바로 우진의 여동생 강현아였다. 물론, 그녀뿐만이 아닌 강현아의 친구들도. 팬클럽 ‘강심장’의 대표로서, 운영진으로서 온 것. “현아!! 손잡아, 손!” “우진 오빠 사진 찍었어?!” “멀어! 잘 안 보여!” “일단, 찍어! 팬카페에 공유해야지!” “‘강심장’ 사람들도 있잖아!” 찾긴 힘들었지만 수많은 사람 사이 우진의 팬클럽 ‘강심장’의 인원들도 끼어 있었다. 그녀들을 포함해 성난 파도처럼 넘실거리는 구경꾼들. “저기 저 남자가 강우진이야?! 뭐야! 귀여운데?” “여기 한 번만 봐주세요!!” “역시 한국 배우가 잘생겼어!!” “실물이 훨씬 낫지 않아??!” “화린이랑 잘 어울려!” 강우진은 터지는 플래시에 눈이 아팠고, 후두둑 박히는 일본어 섞인 괴성에 귀가 떨어질 것 같았다. “이쪽!! 이쪽! 강우진씨!” “일본에 온 소감이 어떻습니까!!” “강우진씨! 타노구치 쿄타로 감독과 일본 일정 중에 만나실 겁니까?!” “화린씨랑 자세 좀 잡아 주세요!!” “‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’엔 언제 캐스팅 확정 되신 겁니까!!” “일본어는 따로 배우셨나요!! 아메토크 show! 녹화는 언젭니까! 강우진씨!” “신인으로서 주연작은 ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’이 처음입니까??!” “이번을 계기로 일본 활동을 본격적으로 시작하시는 겁니까?!” “‘남사친’에 관해 코멘트 간단히 부탁드립니다!!” 비명에 가까운 질문은 거의 겹쳐져서 잘 들리지도 않는다. 중간중간 한국말이 들리는 거로 봐선, 백여 명 일본 기자 중에 한국 기자도 끼어 있는 모양. 순간, 강우진의 오른쪽에 선 우람한 김대영은. ‘······미친. 이런 거 처음 본다. 일본 애들까지 이리 열광할 줄이야. 돌았네.’ 입이 쩍 벌어질 광경에 정신이 팔렸다가 불알친구 우진의 얼굴에 시선을 맞췄다. 새삼 이놈이 진짜 떴구나 싶었으니. ‘이 새끼 이거 진짜 스타됐네?’ 마음 같아서는 ‘지리네 미친놈아!’ 하고 소리치고 싶었다. 하지만 김대영은 꾹 참았다. 대신 조금 있다가 불알친구 전용 단톡방에 호들갑을 떨 결심을 했다. 그러거나 말거나 우진은. ‘토 쏠린다, 겁나 도망치고 싶은데?!’ 정신이 혼미해지기 시작했다. 그 정도의 압박감이었다. 다른 시각으로 보자면 쿄타로 감독과 아카리 작가, ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’의 이름값과 관심도가 이렇게나 높다는 뜻. 어쨌든 강우진으로서도 이런 광경은 처음이며, 연예계 통틀어서 신인에게 이만한 관심이 꽂히는 것도 전무했다. ‘와- 미친.’ 우진도 예상을 안 한 건 아니었다. 비행기에서 최성건이 언질을 주긴 했었으니까. ‘우진아, 아마 공항에 기자 좀 모였을 거다. 너랑 화린씨 일본 일정 관련해서 기사가 돌았거든. 좀 시끄럽긴 할 테지만 뭐, 넌 평소처럼만 하면 돼. 담담하게 손이나 좀 흔들고.’ 근데 이 정도일 줄이야. 강우진은 뒤쪽에 선 최성건을 힐끔하며 속으로 고함을 쳤다. ‘좀??! 이게 좀이라고요? ’ TV서나 볼법한 장면이 현실로 펼쳐지고 있다. 우진은 다리가 후들거리는 것을 느꼈다. 하지만 주변의 가드들이나 화린은 대수롭지 않은 듯 별 감흥이 없다. 강우진은 핀트 나간 정신을 억지로 부여잡았다. ‘안돼, 정신 차리자. 이 악물고 걸어! 강우진, 앞으로 가자.’ 평소보다 과한 마인드 컨트롤을 우진이 시행할 때, 적당히 때가 됐는지 우진을 감싼 가드들이 움직이기 시작했다. 강우진과 화린 그리고 전체 팀이 걸음을 뗐다. 덩달아 기자들 뒤쪽의 팬들이 손을 뻗어댄다. 뭔지 모를 선물들도 던졌다. 하지만 포커페이스를 유지하는 우진은 섣불리 그들에게 다가갈 수 없었다. ‘뭔가- 무섭다. 응, 무서워.’ 쫄아서였다. 뭐, 결과적으론 정답에 가까운 행동이긴 했다. 이렇게 흥분이 과도할 때 다가갔다간 자칫 사고로 이어질 수 있으니까. 따라서. -스윽. 강우진은 화린을 슬쩍 보며 그녀를 카피했다. 적당히 카메라와 일본 구경꾼을 향해 손을 흔드는 것. 그러면서도 강우진이 포함된 팀은 최대한 빨리 입국장을 빠져나간다. 그 순간. -훅! 넘실거리는 기자들과 펜스줄을 넘어 누군가가 재빨리 뛰쳐나왔다. 보통 덩치의 남자였다. 그는 바로 화린에게 돌격했다. 아마 화린의 팬인 모양. “화린!!” 하지만 그는 주변 가드들에게 가로막혔고, 강우진은 왼쪽에 선 화린을 반사적으로 감쌌다. 이건 뭔가 본능이었다. 의도보단 몸이 자동으로 움직인 것. 이어 우진이 가로막힌 남자를 보며 속으로 읊조렸고. ‘뭐야, 저 미친놈. 개놀랐네.’ 천천히 화린 쪽으로 고개를 돌렸다. 우진과 눈이 맞는 화린. 무표정인 우진과는 달리 화린은 양어깨가 잡힌 채 동공이 확장된 상태. 비로소 강우진은 자신이 뭘 했는지 인지했다. “아, 죄송합니다.” 어깨에서 손을 떼며 낮게 말하는 우진에게 화린은 혼 빠진 투로 답했다. “아니···요. 괜찮아요, 감사합니다.” 이때 강우진을 최성건이 불렀고, 얼굴 돌린 우진의 옆모습을 힐끗댄 화린이 조용히 가슴에 손을 올렸다. ‘우진님 박력 뭐야??? 어??’ 입국장의 500여 명이 몰린 것을 봤을 때보다 수배는 심장이 뛰고 있었다. ‘나, 나도 안아버릴 뻔했어! 아니- 은근슬쩍 그냥 안아 볼걸.’ 뒤로. 광란의 공항을 어렵사리 빠져나온 강우진은 갓길에 미리 준비된 승합차에 올라탔다. 승합차는 총 3대에 미니 버스도 보였다. 차로 이동할 땐 우진과 화린은 따로 이동이었고, 승합차 출발과 동시에 우진의 옆자리에 앉은 최성건이 다이어리를 펴며 웃었다. “한- 500명 됐으려나? 생각보다는 좀 적었다.” 뭐라굽쇼? 적어요? 저게? 저것의 두 배 이상이었다면 우진은 진심으로 기절할지 몰랐다. 당연히 이를 모르던 한예정 등의 스타일리스트 팀이 너도나도 끼었다. “맞아요, 좀 아쉽긴 하더라. 막 좀 더 미어터졌어야 했는데! 화린씨도 계셨으니까 최소 2000명은 있었어야죠!” “아마 공항 측 통제가 좀 있었나 봐. 끝쪽에 보니까 공항 가드들이 구경꾼들 막고 있더라고요.” “그래도 저 정도면 평타는 친 거죠?” “평타는 쳤지. 기사나 구경꾼들 SNS나 금방금방 돌긴 할 거야.” “우진 오빠도 아쉬웠죠? 그래서 표정이 평소보단 더 덤덤했어.” 뭔가 멋대로 내려지는 평가에 우진은 침묵을 선택했다. 대체 이분들은 어떤 광경을 바라보며 온 걸까? 2000명이라니. 이쯤, 확정된 스케줄표를 내려보던 최성건이 긴 한숨을 뱉었다. “후- 우진아. 예상하긴 했다만 일정이 지옥이다.” 우진은 속으로 각오를 다졌고 겉으로는 쎈척을 가미했다. “상관없습니다.” “풀 촬영해도 멀쩡한 너나 그렇겠지. 나나 애들은 죽어난다고. 쨌든, 일단 바로 숙소로 이동한 뒤에, 호텔에서 간단하게 식사, 샵가서 헤어 메이크업 받고나서 ‘남사친’ 행사장 이동, 아 여기엔 당연히 넷플렉스 재팬 인원들도 함께할 거고- 또······” 그만. 그냥 전 흐름에 따라 몸을 맡길게요. 더 들어봐야 눈앞만 캄캄해질 뿐. 그렇게 약 10분간 오늘 일정을 읊던 최성건이. “미팅 스케줄이 좀 변동이 있어. 일단 사이사이 홍보스케줄 하고 언론사 인터뷰가 몇 개 추가됐다.” 주제를 휙 바꿨다. “그리고 원래는 내일 27일에 쿄타로 감독이고 28일 신조 PD를 본 뒤에 30일 ‘아메토크 show!’ 녹화였는데, 쿄타로 감독이랑 시간이 안 맞아서 신조 PD를 내일 보고 녹화가 29일. 쿄타로 감독을 30일 날 보기로 했다.” “아, 예. 알겠습니다.” 무심히 고개 끄덕이는 강우진. 그런 그에게 다이어리를 덮던 최성건이 웃음을 보였다. “일본 일정은 이 정도고. 너도 알겠다만 지금 너 각종 방송, 너튜브 등 섭외에 광고 문의도 터지고 있거든? 한량 때 두 배야 거의. 너랑 혜연이 덕분에 회사 확장도 고려할 상황이고. 여튼 그건 내가 알아서 걸러서 큰 건만 잡고 있는데 들어오는 작품들을 어쩔래?” 작품. 현재 국내 연예계 화제성 하면 으뜸으로 치는 강우진이었다. 시나리오나 대본이 안 들어올 리 없었다. 이미 bw 엔터에 한쪽엔 우진에게 보낸 시나리오·대본만 수십 권이었다. 그걸 다 읽어보는 것만 몇 달이 걸리지 않을까? 물론, 그 계산법은 일반 배우들에게나 통용되는 것이고, 강우진이 각 잡고 시작하면 한주면 끝낼 작업이긴 했다. 아공간이 있으니까. 등급이 괜찮은 순으로만 작품을 읽어도 됐으니까. 허나. ‘작품이랑은 별개로, 따라붙는 스케줄 생각하면 지금은 오바지 않나?’ 지금 우진은 예전의 그가 아니었다. 미세하긴 해도 나름 본 게 있다. 거기다 무리하고 싶지도 않았고 할 것도 많다. ‘괜히 뱁새 쫓다가 가랑이 찢어진다고.’ 근데 징징대는 허약한 모습은 컨셉질과 안 맞다. 따라서 우진은 ‘개썅마이웨이’를 가미한 의견을 피력했다. “지금은 예정된 작품에만 집중하겠습니다, 들어오는 작품들은 계속 킵해주세요.” “그래, 그러자. 나도 같은 생각이긴 해. 솔직히 지금 네 스케줄도 일반적이진 않거든. 아니, 딴 놈들은 이거 소화 못 하지. 근데 워낙 네가 여유롭게 쳐내니까 혹시나 해서 물어봤다.” “그다지 힘들지는 않습니다.” “알아, 알아 임마. 그냥 봐도 그래.” 틀렸다. 우진은 지금 아공간이 있음에도 체력은 턱 끝까지 차올랐다. 그래도 컨셉질은 또 유지해야 한다. 참, 하루하루가 벅차다 싶은 강우진이었다. ‘역시 인간은 극한으로 몰려야 성장하는 건가?’ 이때 핸드폰을 든 최성건이 다시 말했고. “작품 얘기는 ‘남사친’이나 ‘마약상’ 나간 뒤에 다시 하자. 어차피 10월 뒤부턴 또 연말이다 뭐다 바빠질 게 빤하니까.” 아- 벌써 연말인가? 보통 연예계는 10월부터 급속도로 정신없어진다. 연말까지 수많은 이벤트성 방송, 행사, 시상식, 영화제 등등이 잡히니까. “혜연이 신인 때 후로 이 기분 간만이다 야. 우진이 너 ‘한량’부터 영화들 해서 여기저기 불러제끼겠네, 크- 기대되는 구만.” 그 모든 것에 강우진이 빠질 리 없었다. 수 시간 후. 도쿄역 근방인 숙소 호텔에서 식사를 마친 우진은 샵에 들렀다가, 도쿄타워 주변에 있는 넷플렉스 재팬에 도착했다. 넷플렉스 재팬의 내부 인테리어는 한국의 넷플렉스와 비슷했다. 다만. “반갑습니다, 넷플렉스 재팬의 존 크레이그라고 해요.” 넷플렉스 재팬의 총괄디렉터는 외국인이었다. 미팅룸에서 그와 악수를 나눈 우진은 약간 신기했다. 하지만 그것도 잠시 바로 행사 관련 미팅을 진행해야 했고. “자- 그럼, 일단 움직일까요?” 넷플렉스 재팬 인원들, 강우진, 화린 팀은 가까운 행사장으로 이동했다. 그야말로 잡스러운 동선 1도 없이 스케줄 따라 착착 진행된다. 넷플렉스 재팬이 준비한, ‘남사친’ 관련 행사장은 이벤트 전용 스튜디오가 몰린 건물이었고. “강우진씨, 화린씨! 일단 무대 위에서 포토타임부터 시작합니다!!” 제작발표회 겸 행사는 기념 사진 촬영부터였다. 스튜디오 내부는 그리 크진 않았다만, 세팅된 모습은 나름 구색을 갖췄다. 넷플렉스 재팬이 초대한 30명 정도의 기자들, 무대 뒤쪽 ‘남사친’ 포스터, 섭외한 사회자 등등. 뭐가 됐든. -파바바바박! -파바바바바바박!! 해외 첫 스케줄임에도 강우진은 그저 기계적으로 움직였다. 뭐, 딴 생각할 여유가 없긴 했다. 간혹 기자석 위에 올려진 다과를 보며. ‘저거 뭐지? 존맛일 것 같은데.’ 군침을 흘리긴 했으나 그게 다였다. 무대 위 강우진의 의상은 캐주얼한 정장이었고, 화린은 체크무늬의 투피스. 그런 둘이 자세를 잡는 포토타임은 대략 10분 정도. 이내 둘은. -스윽. 무대에 마련된 의자에 앉았다. 구도는 사회자, 강우진, 화린, 통역가 순. 우진은 나름 평온했다. ‘다행히 한국에서 했던 것보단 규모가 작네.’ 일본말이 나오는 것을 빼면 별반 다르지 않았고 해볼 만했으니까. 곧, 무대 위 첫 번째 자리의 사회자가 움직였다. 섭외된 사회자는 일본의 아나운서였고. “그럼 시작할게요? 일단- 강우진씨, 화린씨 안녕하세요.” “안녕하세요, 강우진입니다.” “화린입니다- 반갑습니다.” 이렇게 ‘남사친’의 일본 넷플렉스 런칭 기념행사가 본격적으로 열렸을 때쯤, 행사장 뒤쪽 넷플렉스 재팬 인원들이 옅게 웅성거리기 시작했다. 은근 무대 위 우진을 가리키는 사람도 있다. 반면, 그들과 조금 떨어진 곳의 최성건은. ‘흠- 우진이 정장 말고 다른 걸 입힐 걸 그랬나.’ 그저 강우진의 의상을 신경 쓰고 있었다. 이 순간 부산스런 넷플렉스 재팬의 팀장급 간부가 우진을 보며 흥분 섞인 일본어를 뱉었다. 그건 자연스레 최성건의 귀에도 들렸다. “뭐야 구독자 100만 넘은 거야? 고작 일주일 만에?!” < 출국 (4) > 끝","completion":"< Departure (4) > Kang Woo-jin was flustered. For a moment, he forgot the persona he had put on and his eyes went blank with confusion. What am I looking at right now? \\"...This is crazy! What's all this?!\\" He was used to the blinding flashes from his recent experiences. If it was recent, it was during the production announcement of 'Best Friend,' where Kang Woo-jin's no-nonsense attitude had been thrown into the spotlight. No, this was several times more chaotic than that. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapapak!! There were far more cameras than before. To the right of the arrival hall where Kang Woo-jin appeared, a line of fences stretched to the end, and the space was crammed with reporters. Roughly a hundred of them. Behind them, the general public from Japan filled the picture. The reporters had their cameras, and the onlookers all held up their phones. What else could it be for? Over 500 people were frantically taking pictures of Kang Woo-jin and Hwarin, who had just appeared. The interesting thing was this. \\"Are they crazy?! All these people came to see my brother?!\\" Among the hundreds of onlookers, a familiar girl was spotted. It was Kang Woo-jin's younger sister, Kang Hyun-ah. Of course, not just her, but also her friends. They came as representatives and administrators of the fan club 'Kang's Heart.' \\"Hyun-ah!! Hold hands, hands!\\" \\"Did you take a picture of Woo-jin oppa?!\\" \\"I can't see well, it's too far!\\" \\"Just take it! We need to share it on the fan cafe!\\" \\"There are people from 'Kang's Heart' too!\\" Although it was hard to find them, members of Woo-jin's fan club 'Kang's Heart' were also among the throngs of people. Including them, the crowd surged like a raging wave. \\"Is that man Kang Woo-jin?! What! He's cute?\\" \\"Please look here once!!\\" \\"Korean actors are really handsome!!\\" \\"Isn't he much better in person??!\\" \\"He matches well with Hwarin!\\" Kang Woo-jin's eyes hurt from the bursting flashes, and his ears felt like they would fall off from the mixed screams in Japanese. \\"This way!! This way! Mr. Kang Woo-jin!\\" \\"How do you feel about coming to Japan?!\\" \\"Mr. Kang Woo-jin! Will you meet with Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro during your schedule in Japan?!\\" \\"Please pose with Ms. Hwarin!!\\" \\"When were you cast for 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger'?!\\" \\"Did you learn Japanese separately?! When is the recording for the Ametalk show! Mr. Kang Woo-jin!\\" \\"Is 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' your first lead role as a rookie??!\\" \\"Are you starting your activities in Japan in earnest with this opportunity?!\\" \\"Please give us a brief comment about 'Best Friend'!!\\" The near-screaming questions were almost overlapping and hard to hear. Judging by the occasional Korean heard, it seemed that among the hundred or so Japanese reporters, there were also Korean reporters mixed in. Suddenly, Kim Dae-young, standing to the right of Kang Woo-jin, thought. \\"...This is insane. I've never seen anything like this. Who knew the Japanese would be this crazy about him. They've lost it.\\" Kim Dae-young's jaw dropped at the sight, and then he caught the face of his buddy Woo-jin. It dawned on him that this guy was truly a star. \\"This guy really became a star, huh?\\" He wanted to shout, \\"This is insane, you crazy guy!\\" But Kim Dae-young held back. Instead, he decided to make a fuss in their private group chat later. Meanwhile, Woo-jin thought. \\"I feel like throwing up, I really want to run away?!\\" His mind began to blur from the pressure. From another perspective, it meant that the name value and interest in Director Kyotaro, writer Akari, and 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' were this high. Anyway, for Kang Woo-jin, this was a first-time spectacle, and there had never been such attention on a rookie in the entertainment industry. \\"Wow, this is insane.\\" Woo-jin had expected it to some extent. Choi Sung-gun had hinted at it on the plane. \\"Woo-jin, there might be some reporters gathered at the airport. There's been an article about you and Hwarin's schedule in Japan. It'll be a bit noisy, but you just do as usual. Just wave your hand calmly.\\" But he didn't expect it to this extent. Kang Woo-jin glanced back at Choi Sung-gun and internally screamed. \\"A bit??! Is this what you call a bit?\\" A scene that you'd normally only see on TV was unfolding in reality. Woo-jin felt his legs wobble. However, the surrounding guards and Hwarin seemed unfazed, as if it was no big deal. Kang Woo-jin forcibly gathered his scattered senses. \\"No, I need to pull myself together. Clench your teeth and walk! Kang Woo-jin, move forward.\\" As Woo-jin was enforcing an excessive amount of mind control, the guards surrounding him began to move at the right time. Kang Woo-jin, Hwarin, and the entire team started walking. Fans behind the reporters reached out their hands. They threw indiscernible gifts. But Woo-jin, maintaining his poker face, couldn't rashly approach them. \\"Something's- scary. Yeah, I'm scared.\\" He was too scared. But, in the end, it was the right move. Approaching them in such an overexcited state could lead to an accident. Therefore. -Swish. Kang Woo-jin glanced at Hwarin and copied her, waving his hand moderately towards the cameras and the Japanese onlookers. Meanwhile, the team including Kang Woo-jin quickly exited the arrival hall. At that moment. -Whoosh! Someone from the surging crowd of reporters and fence line quickly jumped over. It was an average-sized man. He seemed to be a fan of Hwarin. \\"Hwarin!!\\" But he was blocked by the surrounding guards, and Kang Woo-jin reflexively shielded Hwarin on his left. It was instinctive. His body moved automatically, not by intention. Then Woo-jin looked at the blocked man and muttered to himself. \\"What's with that crazy guy? That scared the hell out of me.\\" He slowly turned his head towards Hwarin. Their eyes met. Unlike Woo-jin's expressionless face, Hwarin's pupils were dilated, her shoulders gripped. Only then did Kang Woo-jin realize what he had done. \\"Oh, I'm sorry.\\" As Woo-jin removed his hands from her shoulders and spoke softly, Hwarin responded in a dazed voice. \\"No... it's okay, thank you.\\" At that moment, Choi Sung-gun called out to Woo-jin, and Hwarin, who had glanced at Woo-jin's profile, quietly placed her hand on her chest. \\"What's with Woo-jin's forcefulness??? Huh??\\" Her heart was racing several times more than when she saw the 500 people gathered at the arrival hall. \\"I almost hugged him! No- I should have just casually hugged him.\\" Later on. After escaping the frenzy at the airport, Kang Woo-jin boarded a minivan that had been prepared on the side of the road. There were a total of three minivans and a mini-bus. When traveling by car, Woo-jin and Hwarin moved separately, and as the minivan started, Choi Sung-gun, who sat next to Woo-jin, opened his diary and laughed. \\"About 500 people, maybe? It was a bit less than I expected.\\" What are you talking about? Less? That? If it had been more than twice that, Woo-jin wouldn't have known if he would have fainted for real. Naturally, the stylists like Han Ye-jung and others joined in the conversation. \\"Right, it was a bit disappointing. It should have been more crowded! With Hwarin there, there should have been at least 2000 people!\\" \\"Maybe the airport had some control. I saw airport guards blocking onlookers at the end.\\" \\"Still, that's a decent turnout, right?\\" \\"It's decent. The articles and onlookers' SNS will be buzzing soon.\\" \\"Woo-jin oppa must have been disappointed too. That's why his expression was calmer than usual.\\" Woo-jin chose silence in response to the arbitrary evaluations. What kind of spectacle were these people expecting on their way here? 2000 people? At this point, Choi Sung-gun, who was looking at the confirmed schedule, let out a long sigh. \\"Phew- Woo-jin. I expected it, but the schedule is hellish.\\" Woo-jin steeled himself internally and added a bit of bravado on the outside. \\"It doesn't matter.\\" \\"You might be fine even with a full shoot, but me and the kids will be dead. Anyway, we'll move to the hotel first, have a quick meal, go to the shop for hair and makeup, then move to the 'Best Friend' event venue, oh and of course, Netflix Japan staff will join us- and then...\\" Enough. I'll just go with the flow. Listening more would only make things seem bleaker. After about 10 minutes of going over today's schedule, Choi Sung-gun said. \\"There's been some change in the meeting schedule. We'll do some promotional schedules in between and a few more media interviews have been added.\\" He changed the subject abruptly. \\"And originally, we were supposed to meet Director Kyotaro on the 27th, then PD Shinjo on the 28th, and record 'Ametalk show!' on the 30th, but Kyotaro's schedule didn't match, so we'll meet PD Shinjo tomorrow and record on the 29th. We've scheduled to meet Director Kyotaro on the 30th.\\" \\"Ah, yes. Got it.\\" Kang Woo-jin nodded indifferently. Choi Sung-gun, who had closed his diary, showed a smile. \\"The schedule in Japan is like this. You know, but right now, you're getting a lot of offers from various broadcasts, YouTube, and even advertising inquiries are exploding? It's almost double since 'Hanryang.' Thanks to you and Hye-yeon, we're even considering expanding the company. Anyway, I'm filtering it myself and only taking the big ones, but what are you going to do about the incoming works?\\" Works. Kang Woo-jin was currently the hottest topic in the Korean entertainment industry. It was impossible for scripts and screenplays not to come in. Already, BW Entertainment had dozens of scripts and screenplays sent for Woo-jin. Wouldn't it take months just to read them all? Of course, that calculation applied to ordinary actors, but if Kang Woo-jin got serious, he could finish the task in a week. He had the void. He could just read the works in order of decent ratings. However. \\"Aren't the schedules that come with the works a bit too much right now?\\" Woo-jin was no longer the same as before. He had seen a bit, albeit slightly. He didn't want to overdo it, and he had a lot to do. \\"Don't chase sparrows and split your legs.\\" But whining about weakness didn't fit his persona. So, Woo-jin expressed his opinion with a bit of his 'my way' attitude. \\"I will focus on the works that are already scheduled. Please keep the incoming works on hold.\\" \\"Let's do that. I was thinking the same. Honestly, your schedule isn't typical. No, other guys couldn't handle this. But since you're handling it so easily, I asked just in case.\\" \\"It's not that difficult.\\" \\"I know, I know, dude. It looks like it even without asking.\\" He was wrong. Even with the void, Woo-jin's energy was at its peak. But he still had to maintain his persona. Oh, every day was overwhelming for Kang Woo-jin. \\"Is it true that humans only grow when pushed to the extreme?\\" Then, Choi Sung-gun, who had picked up his phone, spoke again. \\"Let's talk about the works after 'Best Friend' and 'Drug Dealer' are out. Anyway, after October, it's going to be busy with the end of the year and all that.\\" Ah- is it already the end of the year? The entertainment industry usually becomes incredibly hectic from October. With numerous eventful broadcasts, events, award ceremonies, film festivals, and so on until the end of the year. \\"It's been a while since I felt this way since Hye-yeon's rookie days. Woo-jin, you'll be called everywhere from 'Hanryang' to movies, wow- I'm looking forward to it.\\" Kang Woo-jin wouldn't be left out of all that. Hours later. After eating at the hotel near Tokyo Station, Woo-jin stopped by the shop and then arrived at Netflix Japan near Tokyo Tower. The interior of Netflix Japan was similar to that of Netflix in Korea. However. \\"Nice to meet you, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Netflix Japan.\\" The overall director of Netflix Japan was a foreigner. Woo-jin, who shook hands with him in the meeting room, found it a bit curious. But that was only for a moment, as they had to proceed with the meeting related to the event. \\"Shall we get moving then?\\" The Netflix Japan staff, Kang Woo-jin, and Hwarin's team moved to a nearby event venue. The schedule proceeded smoothly without any unnecessary detours. The event venue prepared by Netflix Japan for 'Best Friend' was in a building filled with event-specific studios. \\"Mr. Kang Woo-jin, Ms. Hwarin! Let's start with a photo time on stage!!\\" The event, which also served as a production announcement, began with commemorative photo shooting. The interior of the studio wasn't very large, but the setup was decently arranged. About 30 reporters invited by Netflix Japan, a 'Best Friend' poster behind the stage, a hired host, and so on. Whatever it was. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapapak!! Despite it being his first overseas schedule, Kang Woo-jin just moved mechanically. Well, he didn't have the luxury to think about anything else. Occasionally, he looked at the snacks placed above the reporters' seats. \\"What's that? Looks like it would taste amazing.\\" He drooled over it, but that was all. On stage, Woo-jin wore a casual suit, and Hwarin wore a checkered two-piece. The photo time for the two of them posing took about 10 minutes. Then, the two. -Swish. Sat down on the chairs prepared on stage. The arrangement was the host, Kang Woo-jin, Hwarin, and the interpreter. Woo-jin was relatively calm. \\"Fortunately, it's smaller than the ones I've done in Korea.\\" It wasn't much different from what he had experienced in Korea, except for the Japanese being spoken, so it was manageable. Soon, the host in the first seat on stage moved. The hired host was a Japanese announcer. \\"Shall we start? First- hello, Mr. Kang Woo-jin, Ms. Hwarin.\\" \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woo-jin.\\" \\"I'm Hwarin- nice to meet you.\\" As the commemorative event for the launch of 'Best Friend' on Netflix Japan officially began, the Netflix Japan staff at the back of the venue began to murmur softly. Some were subtly pointing at Woo-jin on stage. Meanwhile, Choi Sung-gun, who was a bit away from them, thought. \\"Hmm- should I have dressed Woo-jin in something other than a suit?\\" He was just concerned about Kang Woo-jin's outfit. At that moment, an excited Netflix Japan team leader pointed at Woo-jin and spoke in Japanese, which naturally reached Choi Sung-gun's ears. \\"What? Over a million subscribers? In just a week?!\\" < Departure (4) > End"},{"prompt":"< 출국 (6) > 사람은 때때로 자신을 되돌아볼 때가 있다. 대체로 비슷한 말을 뱉는다. ‘와- 내가 이걸 어떻게 했지?’ 따위의. 강우진 역시 살아오며 그런 걸 많이 느꼈다. 디자인회사에서 야근을 밥 먹듯이 하던 나날들. 그리고 방금 우진에겐 하나가 추가됐다. ‘내가 방금 한 게 일본 수어가 맞아? 맞지? 쟤가 알아들었으니까 맞을 거야. 근데 어떻게?’ 바로 일본 수어였다. 직전까진 별생각 없이 몸과 표정이 움직였었다. 그런데 열 몇 살이나 됐을 법한 저 어린 남자의 질문. ‘어떻게 일본 수어를 할 줄 아냐는’ 물음을 보자마자 강우진의 내면엔 의문이 쏟아졌다. ‘···그러게. 왜 됐는지 나도 모르겠는데?? 너는 알어?’ 본인도 모르는 걸 일본 수어를 던진 어린 남자가 알 턱이 없었다. 어쨌든 아주 짧은 시간에 우진의 머릿속에선 수많은 생각이 오갔다. 나라별로 수어가 다르다는 건 그도 알고 있었다. 아니, 몰랐지만 알아냈다는 게 정확했다. 아공간을 통해 수어를 습득한 뒤에 검색해봤었으니까. 그 낯설며 어려운 언어를 단박에 습득했는데 기본적인 정보는 알고 있어야 했다. 그래야 나름 적재적소에 사용할 수 있을 테니. 정보를 확인한 우진은 고개를 끄덕였었다. 생각해보면 수많은 나라는 모두 언어가 다른데, 그 언어를 기반으로 한 수어가 같다는 건 말이 안 되긴 했다. 그렇게 강우진은 자신이 습득한 것이 한국 수어구나- 라고 단정 지었다. 하지만 강우진은 ‘아메토크 show!’의 스튜디오에서 돌연 일본 수어를 보였다. 심지어 전문가도 극찬했던 한국 수어와 동일한 수준이었다. 따라서 우진이 당황하는 건 자연스러운 흐름. 이어 강우진은. ‘잠깐만. 일단, 좀 침착하고. 다시 되는지 확인을 해보자. 우연인가 아닌가.’ 우연일 리는 없었지만 확신은 필요했다. 곧, 우진은 눈 커진 방청객의 어린 남자에게 시선을 붙였고. -스윽. 손을 올렸다. 최대한 방금의 감각을 상기하며 일본 수어를 시도한 것. 근데 ‘시도’라는 말이 무색했다. 강우진은 무탈하게 일본 수어를 보이기 시작했다. 마치 뭐랄까, 몸이 기억하는 느낌과 비슷했다. [“제가 지금 일본 수어를 정확하게 하고 있나요?”] 우진이 부드럽게 수어를 던지자 어린 남자의 눈이 더 커졌다. 그리곤 그 역시 손을 올렸다. [“네. 정확해요. 저보다 더 잘하시는 것 같아요, 전 아직 실수할 때가 있거든요. 지금 하시는 수어 실력은 마치 저의 수어 선생님과 비슷해요. 아니다, 더 잘하세요!”] [“고맙습니다, 저도 일본 수어가 왜 되는지 잘 모르겠어요.” [“네??”] [“아니요. 농담입니다.”] 능수능란한 일본 수어. 실제로 어린 남자보다 강우진 쪽이 더 스무스했다. 이쯤 강우진은 인지했다. ‘뇌가 일본어를 떠올리면 수어를 기억하는 몸이 알아서 움직여준다. 뭔가 융합이 되는 기분이야.’ 일본 수어가 나오는 과정이었다. 와중, 두 남자가 수어를 주고받는 넓은 스튜디오는 적막했다. “······” “······” “······” 신조 PD도, MC 소요도, 최성건도, 이 세트장에 있는 200여 명의 방청객도, 수십 스탭들도. 모두 우진과 어린 남자를 번갈아 볼 뿐 입을 다물고 있었다. 생각지도 못한 충격 때문이기도, 뭔가 난생 처음보는 광경에 정신을 뺏긴 것도 있었다. 그렇잖은가? 애초 수어를 보는 것도 자주 없지만 지금은 토크쇼 녹화 중이고, 일본 수어를 수준급으로 하는 것은 일본인도 아닌 한국의 신인배우였다. 왜 저 배우는 한국 수어도 아닌 일본 수어를 할 줄 아는 것인가? 넋이 나갈만했다. 여기서. “······아, 아!” 멍하니 둘의 수어를 관람하던 빼싹 마른 신조 PD가 불현듯 정신을 차렸다. 그리곤 옆에 선 두 명의 통역 중 수어 통역가에게 물었다. “지금 우진씨가 하는 수어가 일본 수어 맞죠? 한국 게 아니라.” “네···일본 수어예요. 근데 저분 한국 배우라고 안 하셨어요? 솔직히 일본어를 너무 잘하셔서 놀랐는데 설마 수어까지 할 거라곤.” “저도 그렇습니다.” 약간 진중해진 신조 PD가 손을 번쩍 들며 외쳤고. “잠시만 녹화 스톱하겠습니다!!” 무대 위로 우다다다 달려갔다. 핸드 마이크를 든 MC 소요는 여전히 우진을 보며 멍때리고 있었지만, 신조 PD는 아랑곳없이 강우진에게 붙어 바로 물었다. 흥분이 가득하다. “우진씨! 일본 수어도 할 줄 아시는 겁니까?? 일본어만 하는 게 아니라?” 예, 그런가 봐요. 속으로 답한 우진은 겉으로는 목소리를 착 깔았다. “네. 조금. 한국 수어도 가능합니다.” “······한국 수어까지- 뭐 혹시 과거에 수어 관련해서 일을 준비하셨다거나.” “아니요, 전혀요.” “자, 잠깐만요. 그러니까 지금 한국어, 일본어, 두 언어의 수어까지. 총 4개 언어가 가능하시다는.” 정확하게는 영어까지 포함이다만 우진은 딱히 그 부분은 꺼내지 않았다. “그런 셈입니다, 자랑할 정도는 아니구요.” 신조 PD가 바로 일본어를 뱉어댔다. “무슨! 자랑해야죠! 그 정도면 충분히 자랑하고도 남습니다! 와- 우진씨는 대체······그만한 언어들에다가 연기까지. 솔직히 인생 2회차가 아니면 힘들지 않습니까? 혹시 인생 2회차 십니까??” “그럴 리가요.” 충격받은 김에 뱉은 물음이라 신조 PD도 바로 수긍하긴 했고, 차츰 고조됐던 기분이 차분해지는 그가 현 상황을 직시하기 시작했다. “우진씨. 혹시, 그- 한국·일본 수어를 숨길 생각이 있습니까? 방송에 나가도 괜찮냐는 뜻입니다.” “나가도 상관없습니다. 숨길 이유는 없어서요.” 곧, 토크쇼 연출자다운 표정으로 돌변하는 신조 PD. “알겠습니다. 저는 그냥 알아서 이해하겠습니다. 어쨌든 이게 지금 그림이 좋거든요? 반전도 있고. 시청자들한테 충분한 흥미를 선사할 수 있어요. 여기 눈 튀어나올 듯한 소요씨 보세요.” 손짓에 강우진이 고개를 오른쪽으로 돌렸다. 놀람이 점철된 MC 소요가 말없이 엄지를 추켜세웠고, 신조 PD가 우진에게 한 걸음 다가서서는 다시 말했다. “아마 시청자들도 비슷할 겁니다. 그러니까 연출을 가미해보겠습니다.” “연출 말입니까?” “예.” “어떤?” “그건 이제 생각을 좀 해봐야죠. 방금의 장면을 더 멋지게 꾸밀 수 있는.” “······” 잠시간 신조 PD의 얼굴을 무심한 눈으로 보던 강우진이 뜬금 일어났다. “이런 건 어떠십니까?” “예?” “사실, 좀 멀어서 잘 안 보이긴 했습니다.” 이어 우진이 덤덤히, 거침없는 걸음으로 성큼성큼 걷기 시작했다. 200여 명이 모인 방청객이 있는 곳으로. 덕분에 방청객 모두가 움찔대거나 화들짝댔다. 그러거나 말거나 우진은. -스윽. 방청객 바로 앞, 같이 수어를 나눴던 어린 남자의 앞에 섰다. 이내 어린 남자에게 수어를 보내는 강우진. [“여기서 대화하면 하면 잘 보일 것 같은데. 부담될 것 같아요?”] 어린 남자는 당황이 짙은 얼굴이긴 했으나, 감사하다는 듯 고개를 미친 듯이 저었다. 대답을 들은 우진이 뒤쪽 신조 PD에게 톤 낮은 일본어를 뱉었고. “괜찮다고 하시네요.” 신조 PD는. “아! 아예 무대를 벗어난다?? 방청객의 질문을 보자마자, 갑자기 훅 일어나서는 거기까지 다가가 대답을 해준다! 오! 파격적입니다.” 낙찰이라는 미소가 가득해졌다. 두 시간 뒤. ‘아메토크 show!’의 녹화 중 쉬는 시간이 주어졌다. 강우진은 참여해준 방청객들에게 사인 등의 팬서비스를 해준 뒤. -달칵. 홀로 대기실에 입성했다. 최성건이나 우진의 팀은 여전히 녹화장에 있는 모양. 특이한 건, 강우진이 대기실에 들어서자마자 늘 챙겨 다니는 백팩을 집는다는 것. 우진이 백팩에서 꺼낸 것은 시나리오였다. 종류는 상관없었다. -푹! 보기 위함이 아닌 아공간에 진입하기 위해서였으니까. 금세 우진의 시야는 온통 컴컴해졌다. 하지만 강우진은 늘 확인하던, 둥둥 뜬 흰 사각형 쪽으로 움직이진 않았다. 그저. “어우 씨. 녹화 이거 마음만 편하고 빡센 건 똑같네. 여튼 보자-” 제자리에 서서 팔짱을 낀 채 생각을 정리했다. 아니, 정확하게는 ‘수어’를 습득했을 때 로봇 같은 여자가 뱉은 말을 상기했다. ‘[“기본 언어 외의 새로운 언어가 감지됩니다. ‘수어(수화)’를 먼저 습득합니다.”]’ 그랬다, 지금 와서 생각해보니 이상하긴 했다. 수어가 만국 공통어가 아님에도 로봇 음성의 여자는 앞뒤 없이 ‘수어’라고만 말했었다. “근데 그냥 ‘수어’라고만 말했었단 말이지.” 명확히 하자면 ‘한국 수어’라거나 ‘일본 수어’라고 해야 했다. 뭉뚱그려 수어라고 하기엔 그 수가 너무 많다. 능력이 울트라급으로 미친 아공간이 그런 실수를 할 리 없었다. 즉. “내가 몰랐던 부분이 있었던 거지.” 사실, 강우진은 녹화 내내 어느 정도 답을 내린 상태기도 했다. 지금은 그저 실험을 위해 아공간에 들어온 것. 일단 한국, 일본 수어는 부드럽게 된다. 둘 다 느낌은 같다. 그저 해당 언어를 머릿속으로 생각하고, 그것을 수어로 하겠다는 명령을 몸에 하달하면 됐다. 다만. “전세계는 또 아니야.” 만능은 또 아니었다. 예를 들어 프랑스. 불어를 생각하고 수어를 해보려 해도 몸은 아무 반응이 없었다. 이유야 간단했다. “내가 불어를 모르니까.” 여기서 우진은 작게 숨을 뱉은 뒤. “이러면······” 이미 습득한, 현지인 수준의 영어를 머릿속으로 떠올렸고, 몸 전체로 명령을 전달했다. 난 미국 수어를 하겠다고. 천천히 올려지는 두 손. 그리고. -스윽. 막힘 없이 줄줄줄 나오는 미국 수어. ‘된다.’ 순간, 강우진의 입가에 미소가 번졌다. “오케이, 뭔지 알겠네.” 왜 본인이 한국 수어를 제외한 일본 수어와 미국 수어가 가능한지를 파악했으니까. “그러니까 수어는 패시브같은 거야, 조건만 달성하면 어느 나라 거든 가질 수 있는.” 그 조건은 매우 심플했다. ‘해당 나라의 언어.’ 각 나라의 언어였다. 한국어, 일본어, 영어. 현재 강우진이 가능한 언어였고, 수어 역시 이 세 나라는 스무스하게 나왔다. 하지만 언어를 습득 못 한 나라는 불가능. 한마디로. “내가 언어를 늘릴수록, 수어는 보너스 개념으로 따라붙는다는 얘기잖아? 와- 씨. 아공간 진짜 능력 돌았네.” 강우진은 현재 3개의 언어가 아닌, 수어까지 포함해 총 6개의 언어를 습득한 셈이었다. 이래서 그 로봇 음성의 여자가 ‘수어’라 통합해서 표현한 거구나 싶은 우진이었다. “앞으론 언어 하나 배우면 무조건 1+1이겠네?” 아공간의 능력은 정말 기상천외했다. 아니, 그렇잖아? 사람이 한 인생 살면서 언어 6개를 통달하는 게 가능하겠냐고. 기본 언어 외에 하나를 배우기도 힘든 게 보통이었다. 이쯤. “됐어, 일단 퇴장.” 시원하게 ‘퇴장’을 읊조린 강우진. 그의 시야가 바로 아공간에서 대기실로 변했고, 지척에 있는 대기 의자에 앉은 우진이 입꼬리를 비죽 올렸다. “언어 6개라-” 앞으로가 기대됐으니까. 뭐, 수어를 자주 쓰는 건 아니겠지만 필히 언젠가 도움이 될 터였다. 운이라는 건 실력이 있을 때 더 명확히 잡을 수 있다. ‘한국 수어처럼 분명 쓸모가 있을 거야. 일본 수어든 미국 수어든.’ 우진은 확신했다. 수어는 낯선 만큼 유니크하며, 그 귀함 덕분에 어디선가 도사리고 있을 기회를 움켜잡을 날이 올 거라고. 이 순간. -덜컥! 닫혔던 대기실 문이 열렸다. 곧, 강우진은 웃음을 싹 지워내며 무심함을 얼굴에 장착했다. 등장한 것은 꽁지머리 최성건. 그런 그와 우진은 잠시간 말 없는 아이캔택을 나눴다. “······” “······” 먼저 물꼬를 튼 것은 픽 웃은 최성건이었고. “뭘 봐 임마. 네 일본 수어 보고 충격받았을까 봐? 너랑 같이 한 날이 원데이 투데이도 아니고. 난 이제 그냥 뭐든 받아들이기로 했다.” “···그러십니까?” “어. 하나하나 일일이 놀라다간 내 심장이 먼저 멈출까 싶어서. 당연히 이해는 안 돼. 이게 뭐지? 싶고. 근데 하나만 묻자.” “예.” “인간은 맞지?” “······대표님.” “아니아니, 진심으로 대답해줘. 맞지?” “당연히 맞습니다.” 물어본 자기도 병신같았는지 최성건이 머리를 긁었다. “그럼 됐다. 소화도 안 되는 거 억지로 삼켜봐야 탈만 나고, 너 과거 사정이 있기에 지금의 네가 있는 거겠지. 그렇게 쇼부낼 게. 덤벼, 임마. 뭐든 다 받아들여 줄 테니까.” 던져진 농담에 우진 역시 근엄한 장난을 쳤다. “예. 그럼 부담 없이.” “아아아- 그래도 텀은 줘야지! 테트리스도 어? 블록 내려오는 시간이라는 게 있구만. 연타는 안 돼. 아, 예정이나 수환이 포함한 팀 애들한테도 일러뒀어, 그냥 그런가 보다 하라고.” “아- 감사합니다.” “오케이, 슬슬 가자. 2차 녹화 시작한다니까.” 고개 끄덕인 우진이 복도로 나왔을 때 최성건이 아까 있었던 녹화를 상기하며 말했다. “뭐, 오늘 온 방청객들이 거진 그랬다만. 그 친구 있잖아. 너랑 수어 나눴던 어린 애.” “예.” “너 어지간히 팬인가 보더라. 사인받고 그렇게 좋아하는 거 간만에 본 것 같어. 그 표정은 귀하지.” 확실히 그랬다. 어린 남자는 약간 울먹이기까지 했으니까. 근데 생각해보면 충분히 이해되는 우진이었다. 컨셉질과 착각 속 홀로 분투하는 자신과 닮았으니까. “내가 좋아하는 또는 관심 있던 배우와 수어로 대화할 가능성이 얼마나 될까요?” “······하긴. 그것도 일본 배우가 아니라 한국 배우고. 아니, 배우를 떠나서 수어 자체로 대화할 기회가 살면서 많지 않았겠지. 어리기도 하고.” “의도치 않은 고립은 생각보다 빡셉니다.” 진짜로요. 이내 천천히 고개 끄덕이던 최성건이 무표정 우진의 어깨에 팔을 둘렀다. “그래, 그 아이한텐 오늘이 평생 기억에 남을 하루였겠네.” 다음 날, 30일. 아침. ‘토에가’ 영화사. ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’의 제작을 맡은 ‘토에가’ 영화사. 그런 영화사의 대형 회의실. ㅁ자형 책상에 앉은 강우진이 보였다. 물론, 최성건도. 둘의 반대편에는. “갑자기 일정을 변경해서 미안합니다, 급작스런 일이 터져서.” 새치 가득한 쿄타로 감독이 자리했다. 더불어 영화사 직원들도 함께였다. 얼추 대여섯 명. 우진이 쿄타로 감독을 만나는 것은 일본 일정의 마지막이었다. 오늘 할 얘기가 많았다. 작품의 프리 일정이나, 촬영 기간 조율, 홍보 관련 등등. 그런데 왜인지 쿄타로 감독의 표정이 약간 어둡다. 최소 강우진은 그렇게 느꼈고. ‘안 좋은 일이 있으신가? 좀- 다크한 느낌인데.’ 쿄타로 감독은 애써 미소지으며 일본어를 뱉었다. “‘남사친’과 너튜브 소식 들었습니다. 축하해요. 매우 오랜 기간 무명으로 지낸 게, 이제 제대로 빛을 보는 것 같아 나도 기분이 좋아요.” 으레 있는 착각이라 우진은 별수롭지 않게 답했다. “감사합니다, 감독님. 그런데 혹시 무슨 일이 있으십니까?” 되물음에 작게 한숨을 쉰 쿄타로 감독이 다시금 입을 열었다. “······원래 계획은 늦어도 10월엔 대본리딩을 할 예정이었는데 좀 차질이 생겼어요.” “차질?” “음, 어쩌면 리딩이 내년 초까지도 밀릴지 모르겠어요. 반년 정도.” 내년 초? 갑자기? 생각보다 너무 늦다. 심지어 촬영도 아니고 대본리딩이. 이유가 있나? 우진이 쿄타로 감독을 응시하자, 새치 머리를 긁던 쿄타로 감독이 작게 읊조렸다. “전체 투자금의 반 정도가 빠지려는 움직임이 있어요. 이미 30%는 빠졌다 봐야 하고.” 투자금이 빠져? ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’은 대형 영화니 투자금도 퍽 클 것이었다. 그럼 이 영화가 엎어지기라도 하는 건가? 아직 세세히 아는 건 아니다만, 이 상황에 답을 내리는 건 우진에게도 그다지 어렵지 않았다. 그 답을 강우진이 낮게 뱉었고. “혹시, 이유가 저와 관련이 있습니까?” 쿄타로 감독의 표정에서 웃음이 사라졌다. “아니지. 그저 변화를 두려워하는, 썩어 빠진 멍청한 놈들 때문입니다.” 한편, 도쿄의 한 으리으리한 주택. 한눈에 봐도 탄성이 절로 터질 정도의 초대형 주택이었다. 드넓은 마당은 당연하며 주택 자체의 규모도 상당했다. 이 큰집에는 100명이 살아도 아무 문제 없지 않을까? 그런 주택의 내부는 더욱이 대단했다. 천장이 끝없이 높으며 비치된 가구들은 하나같이 초고가였다. 거기에 집에 일하는 직원들만 다섯이 훌쩍 넘는다. 그중 집 청소를 하던 남자 직원이 닫힌 문을 두드렸다. -똑똑. 그러자 안쪽에서 까글한 일본말이 들린다. 늙은 남자 목소리. “들어와요.” 대답을 들은 남자 직원이 문을 열었다. 서재였다. 넓은 공간이 책으로 가득 차 있다. 그곳 중앙엔 늙은 남자가 앉아 있었다. 눈썹에도 흰 털이 섞인, 뭔가 흰털의 사자를 닮은 남자였다. 이어 남자 직원이 그에게 허리를 숙였다. “서재 청소는 어떻게 할까요, 회장님.” 회장이라 불린 늙은 남자가 보던 책을 덮으며 고개를 저었다. “여긴 됐어요, 다른 곳부터 하지.” “알겠습니다.” 이때. -타닷! 남자 직원 뒤로 누군가 뛰어 들어왔다. 14살이나 됐을 법한 어린 남자아이였다. 아이는 곧장 서재 안의 회장이라 불린 늙은 남자에게 붙었고. -스윽. 급작스레 두 손을 올렸다. 일본 수어였다. [“할아버지, 어제 엄청난 일이 있었어요!”] 회장은 아이의 모습에 적잖이 당황하면서도 감격했다. ‘웃었어? 늘 감정 없이, 죽을 표정이나 짓던 녀석이?’ 이게 대체 무슨 일인가? 회장은 애써 놀람을 감추며 금세 환한 미소를 지었다. 극한의 감격이 묻은 웃음이었다. 이어 회장이 아이의 머리를 쓰다듬으며 그 역시 양손을 올렸다. 수어였다. [“그래. 들어보자, 어떤 일이 있었니?”] [“제가 토크쇼 방청객 당첨됐다고 말씀드렸었죠? 거기에 다녀왔는데! 배우님이 일본 수어를 엄청엄청 잘하셨어요!”] [“그 배우는 한국의 배우잖아? 그런데 일본 수어를 할 줄 알아? 이름이 아마- 미안해, 이름이 뭐라고 했지?”] 아이는 ‘아메토크 show!’ 방청객 중 강우진과 일본 수어로 대화한 어린 남자였고. [“강우진! 그런 반짝이는 배우님도 수어를 하실 줄 안다는 게 신기했고, 또 수어로 대화를 한 게 너무너무 기뻤어요!”] 회장이라 불린 늙은 남자의 하나뿐인 손자였다. 곧, 회장은 거의 10년 만인 손자의 방글대는 얼굴을 물끄러미 응시하면서도. ‘수어를 해? 그래, 그렇군. 그 한국의 배우도 나와 같은 사정이 있는 모양이야. 아니고선 수어를 습득할 이유는 없으니까.’ 왜인지 멋대로 착각의 시동을 걸었다. < 출국 (6) > 끝","completion":"< Departure (6) > People sometimes reflect on themselves. They often utter similar phrases like, \\"Wow, how did I manage to do that?\\" Kang Woo-jin had felt this many times throughout his life, especially during the days when he worked overtime at a design company as if it were his daily bread. And now, Woo-jin had added another such moment. \\"Did I just use Japanese sign language correctly? It must be right since that kid understood me. But how?\\" It was indeed Japanese sign language. Until just a moment ago, his body and expressions had moved without much thought. But then, the question from the young boy, who seemed to be in his early teens, \\"How do you know Japanese sign language?\\" triggered a flood of questions in Kang Woo-jin's mind. \\"...Exactly. Why did it work when I don't even know why? Do you know?\\" It was impossible for the young boy who had asked about Japanese sign language to know the answer when Woo-jin himself did not. In any case, numerous thoughts raced through Woo-jin's mind in a very short time. He knew that sign language varied from country to country. Well, he didn't know, but he had found out after acquiring sign language through the void and then doing some research. He had instantly mastered that strange and difficult language, but he needed to know the basic information. That way, he could use it appropriately when necessary. After confirming the information, Woo-jin had nodded to himself. Thinking about it, it made sense that sign languages would be different, just as spoken languages are different in many countries. Thus, Kang Woo-jin concluded that what he had learned was Korean sign language. However, in the studio of 'Ametalk show!', Woo-jin suddenly used Japanese sign language. Moreover, it was at the same level as the Korean sign language that had been highly praised by experts. Therefore, it was natural for Woo-jin to be confused. Then, Woo-jin thought. \\"Wait a minute. Let's calm down and check if it works again. Let's see if it was a fluke or not.\\" It couldn't have been a fluke, but he needed to be sure. Soon, Woo-jin fixed his gaze on the young boy in the audience whose eyes had widened. -Swish. He raised his hand. Trying to recall the sensation from just before, he attempted Japanese sign language. But the word \\"attempt\\" was an understatement. Kang Woo-jin effortlessly began to use Japanese sign language. It felt similar to how the body remembers something. [\\"Am I doing Japanese sign language correctly right now?\\"] As Woo-jin smoothly signed, the young boy's eyes widened even more. Then, the boy also raised his hand. [\\"Yes. It's accurate. You seem to do it even better than I do, and I still make mistakes sometimes. Your sign language skills are similar to my sign language teacher. No, you're even better!\\"] [\\"Thank you, I'm not sure why I can do Japanese sign language either.\\"] [\\"What??\\"] [\\"No, just kidding.\\"] Woo-jin's fluent Japanese sign language. In fact, Woo-jin's signing was smoother than the young boy's. At this point, Woo-jin realized. 'My brain recalls Japanese, and my body, which remembers sign language, moves accordingly. It feels like a fusion.' It was the process of producing Japanese sign language. Meanwhile, the wide studio where the two men were exchanging sign language fell silent. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" \\"......\\" Director Shinjo, MC Soyo, Choi Sung-gun, the 200 or so audience members, and dozens of staff members. Everyone was silently looking back and forth between Woo-jin and the young boy. They were either shocked by the unexpected or captivated by a sight they had never seen before. After all, it's not often that one sees sign language, and now, during the recording of a talk show, a Korean rookie actor was proficiently using Japanese sign language. Why could that actor use Japanese sign language when he wasn't even Japanese? It was enough to make one's mind go blank. At this point. \\"...Ah, ah!\\" Director Shinjo, who had been blankly watching the two sign, suddenly came to his senses. He then asked one of the two interpreters standing next to him, the sign language interpreter. \\"Mr. Woo-jin is using Japanese sign language, right? Not Korean?\\" \\"Yes... it's Japanese sign language. But didn't you say he's a Korean actor? I was surprised he spoke Japanese so well, but I never imagined he could do sign language too.\\" \\"I feel the same.\\" Director Shinjo, now a bit more serious, raised his hand and shouted. \\"Let's stop the recording for a moment!!\\" He rushed onto the stage. MC Soyo, still holding the microphone, was still dazedly looking at Woo-jin, but Director Shinjo, not caring, immediately approached Kang Woo-jin and asked him excitedly. \\"Mr. Woo-jin! Can you also do Japanese sign language? Not just speak Japanese?\\" Yes, it seems so. Woo-jin answered internally and spoke with a lowered voice externally. \\"Yes. A little. I can also do Korean sign language.\\" \\"...Korean sign language too - did you perhaps prepare for a job related to sign language in the past?\\" \\"No, not at all.\\" \\"Wait a minute. So you're saying you can do a total of four languages, including Korean and Japanese sign language?\\" To be precise, it included English as well, but Woo-jin didn't bring up that part. \\"That's right, but it's not something to brag about.\\" Director Shinjo immediately exclaimed in Japanese. \\"What! You should brag! That's more than enough to boast about! Wow, Mr. Woo-jin, with all those languages and acting on top of that. Honestly, it would be difficult unless it's your second life, right? Are you on your second life??\\" \\"That's not the case.\\" Director Shinjo accepted the question, which was asked in shock, and gradually, his heightened mood began to calm down as he faced the current situation. \\"Mr. Woo-jin. By any chance, do you plan to keep your knowledge of Korean and Japanese sign language a secret? I mean, is it okay to broadcast it?\\" \\"It's fine to broadcast it. There's no reason to hide it.\\" Soon, Director Shinjo's expression changed to that of a talk show director. \\"Understood. I'll just understand it in my own way. Anyway, this is a good picture right now, isn't it? There's a twist. It can provide enough interest to the viewers. Look at Soyo, whose eyes are about to pop out.\\" At the gesture, Kang Woo-jin turned his head to the right. MC Soyo, filled with astonishment, silently gave a thumbs up, and Director Shinjo took a step closer to Woo-jin and spoke again. \\"The viewers will probably feel the same. So, I'll add some direction.\\" \\"Direction, you say?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"What kind?\\" \\"I'll have to think about that. How to make the scene just now even more spectacular.\\" \\"......\\" After staring at Director Shinjo's face with an indifferent gaze for a moment, Kang Woo-jin suddenly stood up. \\"How about this?\\" \\"Yes?\\" \\"Actually, it was a bit far, so I couldn't see well.\\" Then, Woo-jin calmly and confidently began to walk with long strides. Towards the 200 or so audience members. As a result, all the audience members flinched or gasped. Regardless, Woo-jin. -Swish. Stood right in front of the young boy he had exchanged sign language with. Then, Woo-jin signed to the young boy. [\\"Would it be more visible if we talk here? Would that make you uncomfortable?\\"] The young boy looked flustered but nodded frantically, as if grateful. After hearing the answer, Woo-jin spoke to Director Shinjo in a low-pitched Japanese. \\"He says it's okay.\\" Director Shinjo exclaimed. \\"Ah! Leaving the stage entirely?? As soon as the audience member asks a question, he suddenly gets up and goes all the way there to answer! Oh! That's groundbreaking.\\" A smile of satisfaction filled his face. Two hours later. During the break in the recording of 'Ametalk show!', Kang Woo-jin provided fan service such as autographs to the participating audience members and then. -Click. Entered the waiting room alone. It seemed that Choi Sung-gun and Woo-jin's team were still in the recording studio. Unusually, as soon as Woo-jin entered the waiting room, he picked up his always-carried backpack. What Woo-jin took out from the backpack was a screenplay. The type didn't matter. -Thump! It wasn't to read it but to enter the void. Soon, Woo-jin's vision was completely darkened. However, Woo-jin didn't move towards the floating white squares he always checked. Instead. \\"Phew, recording is as tough as usual, even if it's mentally easier. Anyway, let's see-\\" He stood in place, crossed his arms, and organized his thoughts. Or rather, he recalled the words spoken by the robotic female voice when he had acquired sign language. [\\"A new language other than the basic language is detected. 'Sign language' is acquired first.\\"] That's right, now that he thought about it, it was strange. Even though sign language isn't a universal language, the robotic female voice had simply referred to it as \\"sign language.\\" \\"But she just said 'sign language.'\\" To be precise, it should have been \\"Korean sign language\\" or \\"Japanese sign language.\\" It was too broad to simply call it sign language since there were so many. The ultra-powerful void wouldn't make such a mistake. So. \\"There was something I didn't know.\\" In fact, Woo-jin had come to a conclusion during the recording. Now, he had entered the void just for experimentation. Korean and Japanese sign language worked smoothly. Both felt the same. He just had to think of the respective language in his mind and command his body to use it as sign language. However. \\"It's not the same for the whole world.\\" It wasn't a universal ability. For example, French. Even if he thought of French and tried to use sign language, his body showed no response. The reason was simple. \\"Because I don't know French.\\" Then, Woo-jin exhaled softly. \\"If that's the case...\\" He recalled the English he had already mastered, at a native level, in his mind, and sent the command to his entire body. He would use American sign language. Slowly raising both hands. And then. -Swish. American sign language flowed out without any hindrance. \\"It works.\\" A smile spread across Kang Woo-jin's lips. \\"Okay, I get it now.\\" He had figured out why he could use Japanese and American sign language in addition to Korean sign language. \\"So, sign language is like a passive ability. As long as the conditions are met, I can have it for any country.\\" The condition was very simple. \\"The language of that country.\\" It was the languages of each country. Korean, Japanese, English. These were the languages Kang Woo-jin could currently use, and sign language also flowed smoothly for these three countries. But for countries whose language he hadn't learned, it was impossible. In other words. \\"As I learn more languages, sign language comes as a bonus concept, right? Wow, the void's abilities are insane.\\" Kang Woo-jin had effectively acquired not just three languages but a total of six languages, including sign language. That's why the robotic female voice had expressed it as \\"sign language\\" in general. \\"From now on, every time I learn a language, it's basically 1+1, right?\\" The abilities of the void were truly extraordinary. After all, how possible is it for a person to master six languages in one lifetime? It's usually hard enough to learn just one additional language. At this point. \\"That's enough, I'm exiting.\\" Kang Woo-jin recited \\"exit\\" refreshingly. His vision immediately shifted from the void to the waiting room, and Woo-jin, who sat down on a nearby chair, curled his lips into a smirk. \\"Six languages-\\" He was looking forward to the future. Sure, he wouldn't use sign language often, but it would undoubtedly be helpful someday. Luck is more clearly grasped when one has the skills. \\"Like Korean sign language, it will definitely be useful. Whether it's Japanese or American sign language.\\" Woo-jin was confident. Sign language was as unique as it was unfamiliar, and thanks to its rarity, there would come a day when he would seize the lurking opportunities somewhere. At that moment. -Thud! The door to the waiting room opened. Immediately, Kang Woo-jin wiped the smile off his face and put on an indifferent expression. The person who appeared was Choi Sung-gun with his ponytail. He and Woo-jin exchanged a silent eye contact for a moment. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" Choi Sung-gun was the first to break the silence with a chuckle. \\"What are you looking at, dude? Were you shocked by your Japanese sign language? It's not like we've been together for just one or two days. I've decided to just accept whatever comes.\\" \\"...Is that so?\\" \\"Yeah. If I get surprised by everything, my heart might stop first. Of course, I don't understand. I wonder what this is. But let me ask you one thing.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"You're human, right?\\" \\"......CEO.\\" \\"No, seriously, answer me. You are, right?\\" \\"Of course, I am.\\" Choi Sung-gun scratched his head as if he felt foolish for asking. \\"Then that's enough. There's no use in forcibly swallowing something that doesn't digest, and you have your past circumstances, so that's why you are who you are now. Let's fight it out. Bring it on, dude. I'll accept whatever it is.\\" Woo-jin also played along with the joke thrown at him. \\"Yes. Then I'll do so without any burden.\\" \\"Ah, but you have to give me some time! Even in Tetris, there's a time for the blocks to fall, right? No rapid-fire. Ah, I've already told the team, including Ye-jun and Soo-hwan, to just think that's how it is.\\" \\"Ah, thank you.\\" \\"Okay, let's get going. The second part of the recording is about to start.\\" As Woo-jin stepped into the hallway, Choi Sung-gun recalled the previous recording and said. \\"Well, almost all the audience members today felt that way. But there was that kid. The young one who exchanged sign language with you.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"He must be quite a fan of yours. It's been a while since I've seen someone so happy to get an autograph. That expression is precious.\\" Indeed, that was the case. The young boy had been almost tearful. But thinking about it, Woo-jin could understand. The boy reminded him of himself, struggling alone amidst his persona and delusions. \\"How likely is it to have a conversation in sign language with an actor I like or am interested in?\\" \\"......Right. And it's not even a Japanese actor, but a Korean one. Besides, the chance to have a conversation in sign language itself isn't common in a lifetime, especially for someone so young.\\" \\"Unintended isolation can be tougher than you think.\\" Really. Choi Sung-gun slowly nodded and then put his arm around the expressionless Woo-jin's shoulder. \\"Yeah, today must have been a day that will remain in that kid's memory for a lifetime.\\" The next day, the 30th, in the morning. 'Toega' Film Company. 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' was produced by 'Toega' Film Company. In the company's large conference room, Kang Woo-jin was seated at a U-shaped table. Of course, Choi Sung-gun was there too. On the opposite side of them was. \\"I'm sorry for the sudden change in schedule. Something urgent came up.\\" Director Kyotaro, with his hair full of gray, took his seat. Along with him were employees of the film company. Roughly five or six people. Meeting Director Kyotaro was the last item on Woo-jin's schedule in Japan. There was a lot to discuss today: pre-production schedule, shooting period coordination, promotion-related matters, and so on. But for some reason, Director Kyotaro's expression seemed a bit gloomy. At least, that's how Kang Woo-jin felt. 'It seems like something unpleasant happened? There's a bit of a dark vibe.' Director Kyotaro forced a smile and spoke in Japanese. \\"I heard about 'Best Friend' and YouTube. Congratulations. It feels like the long period of obscurity is finally paying off, and I'm happy for you too.\\" It was a common misconception, so Woo-jin responded without much concern. \\"Thank you, Director. But is there something wrong?\\" At the question, Director Kyotaro sighed softly and spoke again. \\"...Originally, the plan was to have the script reading by October at the latest, but there's been a hitch.\\" \\"A hitch?\\" \\"Well, the reading might be pushed back to early next year. By about half a year.\\" Early next year? Suddenly? That's too late. Especially since it's not even shooting but just a script reading. Is there a reason? As Woo-jin stared at Director Kyotaro, the director, who had been scratching his gray hair, murmured softly. \\"There's a movement to pull out about half of the total investment. We should consider that 30% has already been withdrawn.\\" The investment is being pulled out? 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' was a major film, so the investment must have been quite large. Does this mean the film might be scrapped? Woo-jin didn't know the details yet, but it wasn't too difficult for him to come to a conclusion in this situation. Woo-jin uttered his conclusion softly. \\"By any chance, is this related to me?\\" Director Kyotaro's smile vanished. \\"No, it's because of rotten, stupid people who fear change.\\" Meanwhile, in a grandiose house in Tokyo. At first glance, it was a mansion that would naturally elicit exclamations. The vast yard was a given, and the size of the house itself was considerable. Wouldn't it be no problem for a hundred people to live in such a large house? The interior of the house was even more impressive. The ceiling was endlessly high, and the displayed furniture was all extremely expensive. There were more than five employees working in the house. Among them, a male employee cleaning the house knocked on a closed door. -Knock knock. Then, a hoarse Japanese voice came from inside. An old man's voice. \\"Come in.\\" The male employee opened the door upon hearing the response. It was a study. The spacious room was filled with books. In the center sat an old man. He had white hair mixed into his eyebrows, resembling a white-haired lion. Then, the male employee bowed to him. \\"How should I clean the study, Chairman?\\" The Chairman, called so by the employee, closed the book he was reading and shook his head. \\"You can skip here, start with the other places.\\" \\"Understood.\\" At that moment. -Tadat! Someone ran into the room behind the male employee. It was a young boy who looked to be about"},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"14 years old. The boy immediately approached the old man sitting in the study. -Swish. He suddenly raised both hands. It was Japanese sign language. [\\"Grandfather, something amazing happened yesterday!\\"] The Chairman was taken aback by the boy's gesture, as he was used to seeing the boy with an emotionless, almost dead expression. 'He smiled? He always looked so lifeless, and now he's smiling?' What on earth was going on? The Chairman tried to hide his surprise and quickly put on a bright smile, filled with extreme delight. He then patted the boy's head and also raised both hands, responding in sign language. [\\"Yes. Tell me, what happened?\\"] [\\"I told you I won a spot in the audience for a talk show, right? I went there, and the actor knew Japanese sign language so well!\\"] [\\"That actor is Korean, right? But he knows Japanese sign language? What was his name again—sorry, what was it?\\"] The boy was the young audience member who had exchanged sign language with Kang Woo-jin at the 'Ametalk show!' [\\"Kang Woo-jin! It was amazing that such a shining actor knew sign language, and I was so happy to have a conversation in sign language!\\"] The Chairman was the boy's only grandfather. Soon, the Chairman stared at his grandson's beaming face, which he hadn't seen in almost ten years, and thought to himself. 'He knows sign language? Yes, that makes sense. That Korean actor must have a similar situation to mine. Otherwise, there would be no reason to learn sign language.' For some reason, the Chairman started his own train of thought. < Departure (6) > End"},{"prompt":"189 * * * 이택현이 움직였다. 이타적으로 플레이했던 지금까지와는 다른 모습이었다. ― 이택현 선수! 과감하게 전진합니다! 오오! 이택현 선수! 좋은 드리블입니다! 수비수의 타이밍을 완전히 뺏어버렸네요! 측면으로 빠져있던 이택현은 과감하게 돌파를 시도했고, 성공했다. 이어서 더 깊숙하게 드리블하며 전진했다. 수비수들을 끌어내는 좋은 움직임이었다. 알제리 수비수들은 반응할 수밖에 없었다. 이택현이 드리블뿐만 아니라 좋은 양발 슈팅 능력까지 보유하고 있다는 걸 알고 있었으니까. ― 이택현 선수! 때리나요? ― 이택현 선수라면 충분히 골을 넣을 수 있는 거리죠! 해설들이 기대감을 드러내며 소리쳤지만, 슈팅 타이밍은 나오지 않았다. 알제리의 수비수 2명이 각을 좁히며 괜찮은 수비를 펼쳤기 때문이었다. 그러나 이때. 툭! 이택현은 수비수들의 키를 넘기는 로빙패스를 시도했다. 침투하는 신재욱을 노린 킬패스였다. ― 우오오오! 패스입니다! 신재욱! 공을 받나요?! 포물선을 그리며 날아오는 공. 신재욱은 그 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅하기에 좋은 자세는 아니었지만, 지금이 최고의 타이밍이었다. 조금이라도 시간을 끌면 튀어나오는 골키퍼에게 방해받거나 근처에 있는 수비수에게 막힐 수 있으니까. ‘지금 슈팅하는 게 나아.’ 공중에 있는 공을 때려내는 슈팅이었다. 당연히 좋은 슈팅을 때려내기엔 더욱 어렵다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 어렵게 생각하지 않았다. 그에겐 더 어려운 슈팅도 성공시켰던 경험이 많았으니까. 퍼엉! 발등과 공이 만나며 듣기 좋은 타격음이 터졌다. 잘못 맞으면 공이 하늘로 붕 뜰 수도 있지만, 신재욱의 슈팅은 그렇지 않았다. 높게 뜨지 않고 낮게 깔린 채로 쏘아졌다. “헉!” 알제리의 골키퍼 라이스 므볼리의 눈이 커졌다. 몸을 날려보려 했지만, 그러지 못했다. 공이 이미 골대 안으로 들어오고 있었으니까. ― 골! 골입니다! 역시 신재욱! 골키퍼가 움직이지도 못할 정도로 강력한 발리슛으로 골을 터트렸습니다! 신재욱의 표정엔 변화가 없었다. 어시스트를 해준 이택현에게 엄지를 들어 올렸지만, 그걸로 끝이었다. 시간이 아까웠기에 곧바로 공을 들고 경기장 중앙으로 달렸다. ― 완벽한 마무리였습니다! 신재욱 선수는 지금처럼 기회가 오면 바로 골을 넣어주는 선수죠! ― 신재욱 선수가 세리머니를 생략하네요! 지난 러시아전에서도 이런 모습을 몇 번이나 보여줬었죠! 이렇게 신재욱 선수가 세리머니를 생략하는 이유는 이미 인터뷰에서 밝힌 적이 있죠? ― 그렇습니다. 더 많은 골을 넣고 싶어서라고 말했었죠. 멋진 이유입니다! ― 러시아전에서 무려 4골을 넣었던 신재욱 선수가 알제리전에서도 시동을 걸었습니다! 한국의 분위기가 살아나기 시작했다. 양쪽 윙어로 나온 이청영과 손훈민이 부진한 모습을 보여주고 있지만, 그럴 때마다 이택현이 측면으로 빠져서 크랙 역할을 소화해줬다. ― 이택현 선수! 드리블이 정말 위협적이네요! 알제리 선수들에게 둘러싸인 상황에서도 기어코 돌파를 해내네요! 신재욱도 활발하게 움직였다. 손훈민, 이택현과 자리를 바꿔가며 알제리 수비수들의 머릿속을 복잡하게 만들었고, 계속해서 밑으로 내려오며 중원 싸움에 힘을 실어줬다. 그러자 알제리는 전처럼 한국을 압도하지 못했다. ― 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수가 경기의 흐름을 바꿔놓고 있습니다! 놀랍네요! 팀에서 가장 어린 두 명의 선수가 이렇게까지 큰 영향력을 보여주다니요! ― 이택현 선수의 돌파가 너무 무서우니까, 알제리 선수들이 라인을 쉽게 올리지 못하고 있죠? 그리고 신재욱 선수는 정말 실수가 없네요. 정확하게 공을 받고, 뿌려주는데, 또 공은 절대 뺏기질 않습니다. 원톱 스트라이커가 이런 역할까지 해주면 동료들은 너무 편해지죠! 낮았던 한국의 볼 점유율도 조금씩 높아졌다. ― 신재욱이 공을 받습니다! 한 명을 가볍게 제쳐내는 신재욱! 최근 월드클래스에 올랐다고 평가받게 된 신재욱은 확실한 클래스를 보여줬다. 공을 가졌을 때와 가지지 않았을 때 모두 강력한 모습을 보여주는 선수답게 모든 상황에서 알제리를 위협했다. 게다가 이택현은 그런 신재욱을 철저하게 보조해줬다. ― 이택현 선수와 2 대 1 패스를 주고받으며 침투하는 신재욱 선수입니다! ― 두 선수의 호흡은 대표팀에서도 여전하네요! 바이에른 뮌헨에서 보여주던 그 모습이죠! 알제리의 수비진을 너무나도 쉽게 흔들고 있습니다! 깊게 침투한 신재욱은 슈팅을 때릴 것처럼 다리를 짧게 휘둘렀다. 반 박자 빠른 타이밍의 슈팅. 다만 알제리의 수비수들은 이런 신재욱의 슈팅 스타일을 이미 연구해왔다. 그래서 빠르게 반응했다. 그러나 슈팅은 속임수였다. 신재욱은 알제리의 수비수가 발을 뻗는 타이밍에 맞춰서 옆으로 이동했다. 수비수는 발을 뻗는 바람에 더는 신재욱의 움직임을 따라가지 못했다. 퍼엉! 왼발로 정확하게 때려낸 슈팅이었다. 날카롭게 휘어진 공은 알제리의 골대 구석으로 파고들었다. ― 동점 골입니다! 신재욱 선수가 기어코 동점 골을 만들어냈습니다! 수비수를 앞에 둔 상황에서도 침착하게 공을 컨트롤하며 정확한 슈팅을 때려내네요! 역시 월드클래스답습니다! 경기장의 분위기가 완전히 변했다. 알제리 선수들은 당혹감을 드러냈다. 신재욱과 이택현의 실력이 뛰어나다는 건 알고 있었지만, 실제로 상대하니 이들이 생각했던 것보다도 더 어려운 상대였다. ‘너무 잘하잖아…? 어떻게 막아야 하지?’ ‘신재욱 하나로도 힘든데, 이택현까지 이렇게 잘하면…….’ ‘이택현이랑 신재욱은 드리블을 왜 저렇게 잘하는 거야? 마음먹고 드리블하니까 반칙하지 않고서는 막을 수가 없는데…?’ ‘위험해…… 신재욱이 골 맛을 보기 시작했어……!’ 반면 한국 대표팀 선수들의 마음속엔 이길 수 있다는 자신감이 생겼다. ‘알제리도 이길 수 있겠는데?’ ‘재욱이랑 택현이가 완전 잘해주고 있어. 점수도 벌써 동점이 됐고. 이러면 충분히 할만하지!’ ‘흐흐! 16강 가는 건가?’ ‘죽기 살기로 뛰어서 1인분만 하자. 그러면 이길 것 같아.’ * * * 신재욱과 이택현이 마음먹고 공격에 집중하자, 알제리의 수비는 비상이었다. 이들은 신재욱과 이택현에게만 집중할 수밖에 없었다. 그렇게 해도 막기가 힘들었으니까. 그러자 자연스레 다른 한국 선수들에게 기회가 생겼다. ― 손훈민! 슈팅! 우와아아아! 들어갔습니다! 손훈민 선수도 슈팅력이 굉장한 선수죠! 분데스리가에서도 인정받고 있는 슈터이지 않습니까? ― 이건 알제리가 너무 손훈민 선수를 편하게 놔뒀네요! 신재욱 선수랑 이택현 선수를 막는 데에만 집중한 것 같네요! 알제리의 수비수들은 머릿속이 더 복잡해질 것 같습니다! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수를 계속 막자니, 지금처럼 손훈민 선수가 편해질 수밖에 없는데 그러면 또 위험해지거든요! 손훈민의 골이었다. 페널티박스 바로 바깥 지역에서 때려낸 슈팅이 그대로 골로 연결된 것이었다. ― 스코어는 3 대 2가 됐습니다! 2 대 0이었던 스코어를 3 대 2로 역전한 한국! 너무나도 대단합니다! ― 경기 재밌네요! 전반전에만 5골이 나왔습니다! 손훈민에게 골을 허용했지만, 알제리는 여전히 신재욱과 이택현을 향한 경계를 풀지 못했다. 그만큼 두 선수가 보여준 실력은 알제리 선수들의 머릿속에 강렬하게 각인됐다. 그러자 계속해서 손훈민과 이청영에게 기회가 생겼고, 후반전부터는 더욱 좋은 기회가 생겼다. ― 손훈민 크로스! 크로스가 조금 긴데요? 오! 이청영 선수를 본 거군요! 이청영 슈우우웃! 아! 아쉽습니다! 이청영 선수의 슈팅이 빗맞았네요! 잠시 후, 뒤에 서 있던 기석용에게도 좋은 슈팅 기회가 생겼다. 기석용은 대표팀 내에서 슈팅력으로는 세 손가락 안에 꼽히는 선수답게 망설임 없이 중거리 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼어엉! 발에 제대로 걸린 슈팅이었다. 더군다나 슈팅을 때린 선수가 기석용이었다. 슈팅 능력만큼은 유럽에서도 인정받는 선수답게, 공에 실린 힘은 굉장했다. 그러나 알제리 골키퍼의 집중력도 상당했다. 기석용의 슈팅 타이밍을 읽은 그는 빠르게 몸을 날렸다. 190cm가 넘는 알제리의 골키퍼 라이스 므볼리. 그는 기어코 손끝으로 기석용이 때려낸 공을 건드리는 것에 성공했다. 투욱! 강렬하게 쏘아지던 공은 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 라이스 므볼리 골키퍼는 손끝에 맞고 튕긴 공을 향해 움직였다. 한국의 선수가 공을 건드리기 전에 빨리 공을 잡아 지켜내야만 했다. 그러나 한 번 몸을 날린 상태였기에, 공을 잡으러 가는 속도가 빠를 수는 없었다. 그리고 그 순간. 전 세계에서 가장 좋은 위치선정 능력을 지닌 선수가 기다렸다는 듯 공을 향해 달려들었다. 툭! 알제리의 골키퍼가 공을 잡기 직전. 신재욱의 발끝이 공을 툭― 찍어 차올렸다. 골키퍼의 손이 닿지 않을 정도의 높이로만 가볍게 띄워 찬 슈팅이었다. 그 공은 알제리 선수들이 지켜보는 가운데, 골대 안으로 날아 들어갔다. ― 고오오오오오오올! 이번에도 신재욱 선수입니다! 지금 몇 골째인가요? 세, 세 번째 골입니다! 해트트릭입니다! ― 알제리를 상대로 해트트릭을 기록하는 신재욱! 기가 막힌 위치선정 능력을 보여주며 추가 골을 터트렸습니다! 이제 스코어는 4 대 2가 됐습니다! 대한민국이 러시아에 이어서 알제리까지 무너뜨리고 있습니다! 그 중심엔 신재욱이라는 천재가 당당히 서 있네요! 경기장이 달아올랐다. 한국 선수들은 미친 듯 흥분하며 소리를 질러댔다. 신재욱은 평소처럼 공을 들고 경기장 중앙으로 향하려고 했지만, 동료들이 둘러싸는 바람에 그러지 못했다. 관중들의 반응도 대단했다. 우와아아아아아아! 브라질에서 펼쳐지는 월드컵인 만큼 한국인뿐만 아니라 브라질인들도 경기장에 많았는데, 이들도 신재욱의 실력을 인정하며 뜨거운 함성을 질러댔다. “으어어어어! 고오오오오오올! 재욱아! 됐다! 네 덕에 됐어! 우리 16강 갈 수 있다고!” “네가 오늘도 해냈어! 재욱아! 넌 내가 정말 형으로 모신다!” “어떻게 딱 골키퍼가 튕겨낸 곳에 딱 서 있냐? 재욱이를 보면 위치선정이 그냥 인자기가 따로 없다니까?” “내가 볼 땐 인자기보다 위치선정 능력이 더 좋은 것 같아.” 기뻐하는 동료들을 보며, 신재욱도 미소를 지었다. 들고 있던 공도 내려놨다. 자신보다 더 기뻐해 주는 동료들과 시간을 보내고 싶어졌다. 그리고 그때. 신재욱의 미소는 더욱 짙어졌다. [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] 허공에 떠오른 메시지들 때문이었다. ‘월드컵답네.’ 대단한 성장 속도였다. 이미 해트트릭을 했지만, 더 많은 골을 원하게 될 정도로. ‘아무래도 오늘 욕심 좀 더 내야겠는데?’ 그래서 신재욱은 다짐했다. 할 수 있는 한, 최선을 다해서 많은 골을 넣겠다고. 알제리 선수들이 충격받을만한 스코어를 만들어주겠다고. ‘미안하지만 내 성장이 우선이라서.’","completion":"189 * * * Lee Taek-hyun made his move. It was a different approach from the altruistic play he had shown up to this point. — Lee Taek-hyun is boldly advancing! Oh! Great dribbling by Lee Taek-hyun! He's completely stolen the timing from the defender! Lee Taek-hyun, who had been on the flank, boldly attempted a breakthrough and succeeded. He then dribbled deeper and advanced further. It was a good move that drew out the defenders. The Algerian defenders had no choice but to react, knowing that Lee Taek-hyun not only had good dribbling skills but also possessed strong shooting abilities with both feet. — Is Lee Taek-hyun going to shoot? — With Lee Taek-hyun's ability, he could definitely score from there! The commentators shouted with anticipation, but the timing for a shot did not come. Two Algerian defenders closed the angle and put up a decent defense. However, at that moment. Flick! Lee Taek-hyun attempted a lobbing pass over the defenders' heads. It was a killer pass aimed at the penetrating Shin Jae-wook. — Woah! It's a pass! Shin Jae-wook! Does he get the ball?! The ball arced through the air. Shin Jae-wook swung his leg at the incoming ball. It wasn't the best posture for a shot, but it was the best timing. If he delayed even a bit, the goalkeeper who was rushing out could interfere, or the nearby defender could block it. 'It's better to shoot now.' It was a shot at the ball while it was still in the air. Naturally, it was even more difficult to make a good shot. Despite that, Shin Jae-wook didn't find it difficult. He had plenty of experience making even more challenging shots. Boom! The ball made a satisfying sound as it connected with the instep. A poorly hit ball could have soared into the sky, but Shin Jae-wook's shot did not. It flew low and straight. \\"Gasp!\\" Algerian goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi's eyes widened. He tried to leap for it, but he couldn't. The ball was already entering the goal. — Goal! It's a goal! As expected of Shin Jae-wook! He scores with a powerful volley shot that the goalkeeper couldn't even react to! Shin Jae-wook's expression remained unchanged. He gave a thumbs up to Lee Taek-hyun, who had assisted him, but that was it. Not wanting to waste time, he immediately picked up the ball and ran to the center of the field. — Perfect finish! Whenever Shin Jae-wook gets a chance like this, he scores right away! — Shin Jae-wook is skipping the celebration! We've seen this several times in the last match against Russia! Shin Jae-wook has already mentioned in interviews why he skips the celebration, right? — That's right. He said he wants to score more goals. A wonderful reason! — After scoring four goals in the match against Russia, Shin Jae-wook has started the engine against Algeria as well! The atmosphere in the Korean team began to liven up. Although the wingers Lee Cheong-young and Son Hoon-min were showing lackluster performances, Lee Taek-hyun would move to the flank and take on the role of a crack player whenever necessary. — Lee Taek-hyun! His dribbling is really threatening! Even surrounded by Algerian players, he still manages to break through! Shin Jae-wook also moved actively. He switched places with Son Hoon-min and Lee Taek-hyun, confusing the Algerian defenders, and continued to drop back to add strength to the midfield battle. As a result, Algeria could no longer dominate Korea as before. — Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun are changing the flow of the game! Amazing! The two youngest players on the team are showing such a significant influence! — Lee Taek-hyun's breakthroughs are too scary, so the Algerian players can't easily push up their line, right? And Shin Jae-wook is just flawless. He receives the ball accurately, distributes it, and never loses it. When a lone striker can play this role, it makes things much easier for his teammates! Korea's ball possession, which had been low, gradually increased. — Shin Jae-wook receives the ball! He easily gets past one player! Shin Jae-wook, who had recently been rated as a world-class player, showed his class. As a player who is strong in all situations, whether he has the ball or not, he threatened Algeria in every scenario. Moreover, Lee Taek-hyun thoroughly supported Shin Jae-wook. — Shin Jae-wook is penetrating after exchanging a 2-on-1 pass with Lee Taek-hyun! — The synergy between the two players is still evident in the national team! It's the same performance they showed at Bayern Munich! They are shaking the Algerian defense line too easily! Shin Jae-wook, who had penetrated deeply, swung his leg as if to shoot. It was a half-beat faster shooting timing. However, the Algerian defenders had already studied Shin Jae-wook's shooting style. So they reacted quickly. But the shot was a feint. Shin Jae-wook moved to the side just as the Algerian defender stretched out his leg. The defender, having extended his leg, could no longer follow Shin Jae-wook's movements. Boom! It was a precise shot with his left foot. The sharply curved ball drilled into the corner of the Algerian goal. — Equalizing goal! Shin Jae-wook has managed to score the equalizer! Even with a defender in front of him, he calmly controlled the ball and made an accurate shot! Truly world-class! The atmosphere in the stadium completely changed. The Algerian players showed signs of confusion. They knew Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun were skilled, but facing them in reality, they were even more challenging opponents than they had thought. 'They're too good... How do we stop them?' 'Just Shin Jae-wook alone is tough, but with Lee Taek-hyun playing this well...' 'Why are Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun so good at dribbling? When they decide to dribble, it's impossible to stop them without fouling...' 'It's dangerous... Shin Jae-wook is starting to get a taste for goals...!' On the other hand, the Korean national team players felt a growing confidence that they could win. 'We can beat Algeria, right?' 'Jae-wook and Taek-hyun are doing so well. We've already tied the score. We can definitely do this!' 'Hehe! Are we going to the round of 16?' 'Let's give it our all and do our part. Then we might win.' * * * As Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun focused on attacking, the Algerian defense was in emergency mode. They had no choice but to concentrate solely on Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun. Even that was difficult to defend against. As a result, other Korean players naturally found opportunities. — Son Hoon-min! Shooting! Wow! It's in! Son Hoon-min is also a player with tremendous shooting power, isn't he? He's recognized in the Bundesliga as a shooter, right? — Algeria let Son Hoon-min shoot too comfortably! It seems they were only focused on stopping Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun! The Algerian defenders' minds must be getting more complicated! If they keep focusing on stopping Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun, Son Hoon-min will have more freedom like now, and that becomes dangerous! It was Son Hoon-min's goal. A shot from just outside the penalty box connected directly to a goal. — The score is now 3 to 2! Korea has turned the score from 2 to 0 to 3 to 2! This is incredible! — What an exciting game! Five goals have been scored just in the first half! Despite conceding a goal to Son Hoon-min, Algeria still couldn't let their guard down against Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun. The skills displayed by the two players were strongly imprinted in the minds of the Algerian players. As a result, Son Hoon-min and Lee Cheong-young continued to find opportunities, and even better chances arose from the second half. — Son Hoon-min crosses! The cross is a bit long, isn't it? Oh! He saw Lee Cheong-young! Lee Cheong-young shoooots! Ah! It's a pity! Lee Cheong-young's shot went off target! Shortly after, Ki Seok-yong, who was standing behind, also found a good shooting opportunity. True to his reputation as one of the top three shooters in the national team, Ki Seok-yong did not hesitate to take a mid-range shot. Boom! The shot was well-struck. Moreover, it was Ki Seok-yong who took the shot. As a player recognized in Europe for his shooting ability, the power behind the ball was tremendous. However, the Algerian goalkeeper's concentration was also remarkable. Reading Ki Seok-yong's shooting timing, he quickly leaped. The Algerian goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi, over 190cm tall. He managed to touch the ball shot by Ki Seok-yong with the tips of his fingers. Thwock! The fiercely shot ball suddenly lost its power. Goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi moved towards the ball that had been deflected by his fingertips. He had to quickly secure the ball before any Korean player could touch it. But having already leaped once, he couldn't move quickly to grab the ball. And at that moment. The player with the best positioning ability in the world rushed towards the ball as if he had been waiting. Tap! Just before the Algerian goalkeeper could grab the ball. Shin Jae-wook lightly flicked the ball with the tip of his foot. It was a shot that lightly lifted the ball just high enough to be out of the goalkeeper's reach. The ball flew into the goal as the Algerian players watched. — Goooooal! It's Shin Jae-wook again! How many goals is that now? Three, it's his third goal! A hat-trick! — Shin Jae-wook records a hat-trick against Algeria! He scores an additional goal with his incredible positioning ability! Now the score is 4 to 2! South Korea is bringing down Algeria following Russia! And at the center of it all stands the genius, Shin Jae-wook! The stadium erupted. The Korean players screamed excitedly like madmen. Shin Jae-wook, as usual, intended to pick up the ball and head to the center of the field, but his teammates surrounded him, preventing him from doing so. The reaction from the crowd was also tremendous. Waaaaah! As it was the World Cup held in Brazil, not only Koreans but also Brazilians were present in the stadium, and they too shouted hot cheers, acknowledging Shin Jae-wook's skills. \\"Uwaaaaah! Goooooal! Jae-wook! That's it! Thanks to you, we can do it! We can go to the round of 16!\\" \\"You did it again today, Jae-wook! You're really someone I respect as a brother!\\" \\"How can you be exactly in the spot where the goalkeeper deflects the ball? When I look at Jae-wook, it's like he has a natural gift for positioning!\\" \\"In my opinion, his positioning ability seems even better than a natural gift.\\" Watching his teammates celebrate joyfully, Shin Jae-wook also smiled. He put down the ball he was holding. He wanted to spend time with his teammates who were happier for him than himself. And then, at that moment. Shin Jae-wook's smile deepened. [Your Stamina has increased by 1!] [Your Agility has increased by 1!] It was because of the messages that floated in the air. 'This is worthy of the World Cup.' It was an impressive rate of growth. Even though he had already scored a hat-trick, he wanted to score even more goals. 'Maybe I should be a bit more greedy today?' So Shin Jae-wook made a resolution. To do his best and score as many goals as possible. To give the Algerian players a shocking score. 'Sorry, but my growth comes first.'"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is very important to my career. I will tip 200.","completion":"AXI(Avanced eXtensible Interface) 버스는 ARM 회사에서 개발한 AMBA(Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) 프로토콜 중 하나입니다. AMBA 프로토콜은 SOC(System On Chip) 내의 마이크로컨트롤러와 주변기기의 연결을 위한 인터페이스로, 그 중 AXI 버스는 고성능, 고속의 데이터 전송을 위해 설계되었습니다. AXI는 크게 다섯 가지의 채널로 구성되어 있습니다: 1. Read Address Channel (읽기 주소 채널) 2. Read Data Channel (읽기 데이터 채널) 3. Write Address Channel (쓰기 주소 채널) 4. Write Data Channel (쓰기 데이터 채널) 5. Write Response Channel (쓰기 응답 채널) 각 채널은 별도의 신호 세트를 가지고 있어서, 데이터 전송 과정에서 여러 트랜잭션(데이터 전송 작업)이 동시에 이루어질 수 있습니다. 이러한 구조 덕분에 신호의 지연 시간을 줄이고 전송 효율을 높일 수 있습니다. AXI 버스의 주요 특징은 다음과 같습니다: - 지원되는 전송 유형: 가변 길이 버스트(Variable Length Burst), 고정 길이 버스트(Fixed Length Burst), INCR 및 WRAP 버스트 유형 - 별도의 주소/데이터 채널: 동시에 다수의 데이터 전송이 가능한 별도 채널 설계 - 아웃-오브-오더(Out-of-order) 트랜잭션: 순서에 구애받지 않고 데이터 전송이 가능 - 지원하는 데이터 폭: AXI는 최대 1024 비트 데이터 폭을 지원함 (하지만 일반적으로는 32 또는 64비트를 사용함) - 낮은 지연시간과 높은 처리 능력을 제공하는 구조 실제 사용 예로는, 프로세서와 빠른 메모리 간의 높은 처리량이 필요한 상황이나, 멀티코어 프로세서에서 여러 프로세서 코어와 메모리 관리자 간의 통신, 고속 입출력 장치들과의 통신 등에서 볼 수 있습니다. AXI는 이러한 높은 성능을 제공할 뿐만 아니라, 확장 가능하고, 모듈화되어 있어, 다양한 구성의 시스템에 적용하기 용이합니다. 그리고 반도체 설계를 위한 HDL(하드웨어 기술 언어)로 AXI 인터페이스를 코딩하며, FPGA(Field-Programmable Gate Array) 또는 ASIC(Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) 기반의 시스템에 적용됩니다. 일반적으로 SoC나 ASIC의 설계 단계에서 버스 시스템의 선택은 해당 시스템의 성능과 효율성에 큰 영향을 미치기 때문에, AXI 버스를 이해하고 사용할 수 있는 능력은 시스템 설계자에게 중요한 자질이 됩니다. 따라서 AXI에 대한 깊은 이해는 여러분의 경력에서 매우 중요한 부분일 수 있습니다.

AXI 버스에서는 각 채널에 대해 핸드셰이크가 이루어집니다. 핸드셰이크는 일반적으로 두 가지 신호로 구성됩니다: VALID 신호와 READY 신호입니다. - VALID 신호: 송신자가 데이터를 전송할 준비가 되었음을 나타냅니다. - READY 신호: 수신자가 데이터를 받을 준비가 되었음을 나타냅니다. 핸드셰이크의 과정은 다음과 같습니다: 1. 송신자는 데이터와 함께 VALID 신호를 '1'로 설정합니다. 이는 송신자가 데이터를 전송할 준비가 되었음을 의미합니다. 2. 수신자는 READY 신호를 '1'로 설정하여 데이터를 받을 준비가 되었음을 나타냅니다. 3. 두 신호가 모두 '1'일 때, 데이터가 전송됩니다. 이 순간을 핸드셰이크가 완료되었다고 합니다. 4. 데이터가 전송된 후, 송신자와 수신자는 각각의 VALID와 READY 신호를 '0'으로 되돌립니다. 예를 들어, 마스터 디바이스가 슬레이브 디바이스로 데이터를 전송하려고 할 때, 마스터는 Write Address Channel을 통해 쓰기 주소와 VALID 신호를 전송합니다. 슬레이브는 준비가 되면 READY 신호를 '1'로 설정하여 주소를 받을 준비가 되었음을 마스터에게 알립니다. 이때 두 신호가 모두 '1'이 되면, 주소 전송이 완료되고, 데이터 전송이 시작됩니다. 이러한 핸드셰이크 메커니즘은 AXI 버스의 모든 채널에서 동일하게 적용됩니다. 예를 들어, Read Address Channel, Write Data Channel 등에서도 같은 방식으로 핸드셰이크가 이루어집니다. AXI 버스에서의 핸드셰이크는 데이터의 동기화와 흐름 제어를 위해 매우 중요하며, 이를 통해 다양한 클록 도메인과 속도를 가진 시스템 구성 요소들이 효율적으로 통신할 수 있습니다. 따라서 AXI 버스를 사용하는 시스템 설계자는 핸드셰이크 메커니즘을 정확히 이해하고 적용할 수 있어야 합니다."},{"prompt":"jakkk szybko sprawdzic ktory uklad rownian jest oznaczony i co to oznacza","completion":"Aby szybko sprawdzić, który układ równań jest oznaczony, musimy się posiłkować własnościami wyznaczników macierzy. Jednak najpierw warto wyjaśnić, co to znaczy, że układ równań jest oznaczony: Układ równań liniowych jest oznaczony, jeśli posiada dokładnie jedno rozwiązanie. W przypadku układu równań liniowych zapisanych w formie macierzowej Ax = b, gdzie A jest macierzą współczynników, x wektorem niewiadomych, a b wektorem wyrazów wolnych, forma oznaczoności jest związana z własnościami macierzy A. Układ jest oznaczony, gdy macierz A jest macierzą kwadratową (ma tyle samo wierszy co kolumn) i jej wyznacznik jest różny od zera. Sposoby sprawdzenia oznaczoności: 1. Metoda wyznacznikowa (dla macierzy kwadratowych): a. Oblicz wyznacznik macierzy współczynników ( det(A) ). b. Jeśli ( det(A) neq 0 ), układ jest oznaczony. 2. Metoda rządowa: a. Oblicz rząd macierzy współczynników (text{rz}(A)) oraz rząd macierzy rozszerzonej [A|b], gdzie [A|b] jest macierzą utworzoną przez dołączenie wektora wyrazów wolnych jako dodatkowej kolumny do macierzy A. b.

Jeśli (text{rz}(A) = text{rz}([A|b]) < n), układ jest nieoznaczony (ma nieskończenie wiele rozwiązań). Aby szybko ocenić oznaczoność układu równań, możesz korzystać z powyższych metod (jeśli jesteś w stanie szybko obliczyć wyznaczniki lub rangi macierzy), ale we współczesnym świecie często korzysta się z dostępnych narzędzi komputerowych, które mogą to zrobić niemalże natychmiastowo.

Jest on używany do rozwiązywania równań matematycznych, analizy własności macierzy, a także ma wiele zastosowań w innych dziedzinach, takich jak fizyka, inżynieria czy ekonomia. Wyznacznik macierzy A, zazwyczaj oznaczany jako det(A), dostarcza ważnych informacji o macierzy. Na przykład: - Jeśli wyznacznik macierzy jest równy zero, to macierz jest osobliwa (nieodwracalna), co oznacza, że nie istnieje macierz odwrotna do danej macierzy. - Jeśli wyznacznik jest niezerowy, macierz jest nieosobliwa (odwracalna) i istnieje macierz odwrotna do niej. - W kontekście układów równań liniowych, niezerowy wyznacznik wskazuje, że układ równań jest oznaczony, czyli ma jedno rozwiązanie. - Wyznacznik macierzy może być również interpretowany geometrycznie jako skala, w jakiej dana macierz transformuje objętość w przestrzeni n-wymiarowej. Wyznacznik macierzy 2x2 jest obliczany jako: Jeśli masz macierz: A = |a b| |c d| wówczas wyznacznik det(A) jest obliczany z wzoru: det(A) = ad - bc. Dla macierzy o wyższych wymiarach, liczba operacji potrzebna do obliczenia wyznacznika rośnie eksponencjalnie, ale istnieją metody obliczania wyznacznika dla macierzy 3x3, 4x4 itd., takie jak rozwinięcie Laplace'a czy metoda eliminacji Gaussa (która również prowadzi do uproszczenia obliczeń wyznacznika). W kontekście układów równań liniowych, wyznacznik macierzy współczynników pozwala nam stwierdzić, czy układ jest oznaczony (det(A) ≠ 0), czy jest on nieoznaczony lub sprzeczny (det(A) = 0)."},{"prompt":"25.

Ile wynosi pole powierzchni całkowitej bryły otrzymanej w ten sposób","completion":"Jeśli Zosia złożyła dwa identyczne prostopadłościany o krawędziach 4 cm, 6 cm i 8 cm, aby otrzymać graniastosłup prawidłowy, to musiała ułożyć je w taki sposób, że powstała bryła jest graniastosłupem prawidłowym czworokątnym, ponieważ tylko w takiej sytuacji możliwe jest uzyskanie podstawy będącej kwadratem. Mamy dwie możliwości umieszczenia prostopadłościanów: 1. Ułożenie ich tak, że krótsze krawędzie (4 cm i 6 cm) tworzą boki kwadratu, co jest niemożliwe, gdyż 4 cm nie równa się 6 cm. 2. Ułożenie ich tak, że dłuższe krawędzie (6 cm i 8 cm) tworzą boki kwadratu, co jest możliwe tylko wtedy, gdy umieścimy prostopadłościany końcami o jednakowych długościach przy sobie, aby uzyskać podstawę o wymiarach 8 cm x 8 cm. Zatem twierdząc, że Zosia utworzyła graniastosłup prawidłowy czworokątny, długości boków podstawy tego graniastosłupa wynoszą 8 cm, a wysokość graniastosłupa, która równa się sumie długości krótszych krawędzi obu prostopadłościanów, wynosi 4 cm + 4 cm = 8 cm. Graniastosłup prawidłowy czworokątny ma w podstawie kwadrat i cztery ściany boczne, które są również kwadratami. Aby obliczyć pole powierzchni całkowitej bryły, musimy dodać pola powierzchni podstaw i ścian bocznych: ( P_c = 2P_p + P_b ), gdzie: ( P_c ) - pole powierzchni całkowitej, ( P_p ) - pole jednej podstawy, ( P_b ) - pole powierzchni bocznej. Pole jednej podstawy kwadratowej, gdzie bok ma długość 8 cm, wynosi: ( P_p = a^2 ), ( P_p = 8 text{cm} cdot 8 text{cm} = 64 text{cm}^2 ). Ponieważ mamy dwie identyczne podstawy, pole obu podstaw wyniesie: ( 2P_p = 2 cdot 64 text{cm}^2 = 128 text{cm}^2 ). Pole powierzchni bocznej to suma pól czterech jednakowych ścian bocznych (kwadratów), więc: ( P_b = 4 cdot a cdot h ), gdzie ( a ) to długość boku podstawy, a ( h ) to wysokość graniastosłupa (która również wynosi 8 cm). Zatem: ( P_b = 4 cdot 8 text{cm} cdot 8 text{cm} = 256 text{cm}^2 ). Dodajemy pola podstaw i boczne: ( P_c = 2P_p + P_b = 128 text{cm}^2 + 256 text{cm}^2 = 384 text{cm}^2 ).

It was during a particularly harsh winter in the 18th century when Alistair, a solitary yet curious explorer, stumbled upon an ancient and mysterious artifact while seeking shelter in a cave. The artifact, an amulet wrought in a metal unknown to him, emanated an otherworldly glow, compelling Alistair to reach out and touch it. The moment his fingers grazed the surface, a surge of energy enveloped him; ice raced across his clothing and skin, hardening and muting the once vibrant life within. His last conscious thought was a silent plea for warmth before his senses succumbed to the icy grip. Alistair's crystalline prison lay hidden deep within the cave, shrouded in frozen silence, for centuries. Empires rose and fell; the world above evolved with the clamorous march of progress. Yet, Alistair remained unchanged, a man locked in an endless winter. It was during an excavation in the year 2518 that Alistair would find his existence irrevocably altered. Aris, a bright-eyed archaeologist, unearthed the cave and, with it, the enigma of a frozen man. The advanced technology of the future made it possible; a careful, precise process began to return Alistair to the living. Thawed into a world that bore no resemblance to the one he had known, Alistair awoke to faces obscured not by cloaks or bonnets, but by augmented visors streaming data about the miracle that was his revival. He learned he was in a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to the new science of chrono-recovery, a field that sought to bring back those claimed by time's embrace. Alistair’s mind struggled to grasp the changes: transportation that defied gravity, buildings that pierced the clouds, languages that were born of code and symbol. The feeling of timelessness had not left him with the ice, it clung to his soul like a shadow. For months, Alistair underwent rehabilitation and education, confronting the monumental task of bridging centuries of human development. He was a marvel to the denizens of this future, an enigma that blurred the lines between history and myth. The people of the new world were kind to him, but it was clear he was something of an oddity, a display from a bygone era. He felt a profound sense of isolation, his identity trapped between the life he had known and the life that throbbed around him, untamed and strange. With every sunrise, Alistair faced this new world with quiet courage. He was a man out of time, a relic of the human condition, and he stirred the hearts and imaginations of those around him. He became a guest lecturer at universities, sharing tales of his past with hungry minds eager to peer through the window he presented into history. Yet, he longed for a connection that could transcend time, a friendship, perhaps even love, that wasn’t shaded by the novelty of his existence. A whisper of hope led him to discover others like him; those who had been revived through similar means. They formed a unique society, bound by their shared displacement in time. Together, Alistair and his new companions sought ways to integrate into this futuristic society. They became ambassadors of history, consultants on ancient cultures, and advocates for the ethical treatment of those who, like them, had been snatched from the jaws of time. In a world teeming with innovation and boundless possibility, Alistair discovered that the essence of humanity remained constant. Emotions, desires, and dreams were not exclusive to any one era. He built a life rich in experience and purpose. A frozen man who awoke to a future bright and beautiful, finding his place among the stars."},{"prompt":"Demande d'emploi dans un dépôt pharmaceutique","completion":"Objet : Demande d'emploi dans un dépôt pharmaceutique Madame, Monsieur, Je me permets de vous adresser ma candidature pour un emploi dans un dépôt pharmaceutique au sein de votre entreprise.

} } 我怎么判断 exitedobject 是 由于 子组件 dropdown 切换下拉内容导致的 exit事件呢？","completion":"在Unity中，\`OnPointerExit\`事件触发时通常表明鼠标指针已离开了UI元素。但如果你想要知道这个离开事件是否因为某个子组件（比如Dropdown）导致的，你需要检查eventData的一些其他属性或者寻找子组件特定的行为。 \`PointerEventData.pointerCurrentRaycast\`会给出当前的射线投射信息。如果指针离开的原因是由于它进入了另一个UI元素（例如，Dropdown列表打开时），那么你可能会注意到\`eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject\`变成了新的UI元素，而不是null。 为了检查\`exitedObject\`是否由于下拉列表的展开引起的退出事件，你可以采用以下方式： 1. 检查新的射线投射目标是否也是Dropdown的一部分。 2. 使用事件冒泡原则，从\`eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject\`开始向上查找，直到找到其中的Dropdown组件（如果有）。 3. 监听Dropdown组件的特定事件，如onValueChanged，来判断是否因为选择改变而引起exit。 以下是一个范例代码片段说明了如何检查退出事件是否由Dropdown组件引起： \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; using UnityEngine.UI; // 确保导入UI命名空间以访问Dropdown组件 public class YourComponent : MonoBehaviour, IPointerExitHandler { public bool isMouseOver; public Dropdown dropdown; private void Start() { // 确认你有Dropdown组件的引用 if (dropdown == null) { dropdown = GetComponentInChildren<Dropdown>(); } } public void OnPointerExit(PointerEventData eventData) { GameObject exitedObject = eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject; if (exitedObject == this.gameObject) { // 如果退出了当前物体，检查是否是因为Dropdown bool exitedBecauseOfDropdown = IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown(eventData); // 根据是否是下拉菜单触发的离开进行处理 if (!exitedBecauseOfDropdown) { isMouseOver = false; } } } private bool IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown(PointerEventData eventData) { if (dropdown != null && dropdown.transform.IsChildOf(exitedObject.transform)) { // 检查退出的对象是否是Dropdown或其子项 return true; } // 检查新的射线投射对象是否仍然属于Dropdown结构 if (eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject != null) { return eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject.transform.IsChildOf(dropdown.transform); } return false; } } \`\`\` 注意：上述代码假设你在同一GameObject或其子组件中有一个Dropdown组件的引用。如果没有，你需要调整代码以适应你的特定层级结构。"},{"prompt":"error：if (dropdown != null && dropdown.transform.IsChildOf(exitedObject.transform) exitedObject not found","completion":"抱歉给你带来困惑。在\`OnPointerExit\`方法中，你应该使用\`eventData.pointerEnter\`来获取鼠标此前指向的对象，而不是\`eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject\`，因为后者表示射线当前命中的物体，而在\`OnPointerExit\`事件中这可能为 null。 如果Dropdown打开时鼠标离开触发了\`OnPointerExit\`，你可以检查鼠标当前进入的对象\`eventData.pointerEnter\`，看看是不是Dropdown的选项列表的一部分。以下是更新后的检查逻辑： \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; using UnityEngine.UI; // 导入UI命名空间以使用Dropdown组件 public class YourComponent : MonoBehaviour, IPointerExitHandler { public bool isMouseOver; public Dropdown dropdown; private void Start() { // 确保你有Dropdown组件的引用 if (dropdown == null) { dropdown = GetComponentInChildren<Dropdown>(); } } public void OnPointerExit(PointerEventData eventData) { // eventData.pointerEnter 是鼠标之前进入的对象 GameObject exitedObject = eventData.pointerEnter; if (exitedObject == this.gameObject) { // 如果鼠标之前进入当前物体，检查是否由于Dropdown bool exitedBecauseOfDropdown = IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown(eventData); // 只有当不是因为Dropdown才设定isMouseOver为false if (!exitedBecauseOfDropdown) { isMouseOver = false; } } } private bool IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown(PointerEventData eventData) { // eventData.pointerEnter 是鼠标之前进入的对象 if (dropdown != null && eventData.pointerEnter != null) { Transform currentEnterTransform = eventData.pointerEnter.transform; // 如果退出事件的对象是Dropdown或其子项，则返回true if (currentEnterTransform.IsChildOf(dropdown.transform)) { return true; } } return false; } } \`\`\` 在这个示例代码中，我们假定你有一个指向Dropdown组件的引用，然后我们检查\`eventData.pointerEnter\`，也就是鼠标之前进入的对象。如果该对象是Dropdown本身或其子项（比如其中一个选项），那么我们可以认为是因为用户与Dropdown交互而导致的\`OnPointerExit\`事件。在这种情况下，我们不会改变\`isMouseOver\`状态。如果\`eventData.pointerEnter\`不是Dropdown或其子项，我们将\`isMouseOver\`设为\`false\`。"},{"prompt":"exitedObject == this.gameObject 这个条件永远不相等 是不是 判断有问题 ？","completion":"是的，您提到的那行代码存在逻辑问题。在\`OnPointerExit\`事件中，\`eventData.pointerEnter\`通常是在鼠标离开之前鼠标所指向的对象。然而，因为此时鼠标已经离开了那个对象，所以它应当与当前组件的\`gameObject\`不同。正确的做法是检查你的组件是否之前包含了鼠标指针，而不是检查\`eventData.pointerEnter\`。 如果你想要判断鼠标是否因为进入了Dropdown选项列表而触发了\`OnPointerExit\`，你不需要比较\`eventData.pointerEnter\`与\`this.gameObject\`。相反，你应该直接检查是否存在针对Dropdown的特殊情况，然后再决定是否改变\`isMouseOver\`状态。 让我们重构代码： \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; using UnityEngine.UI; public class YourComponent : MonoBehaviour, IPointerExitHandler { public bool isMouseOver; public Dropdown dropdown; public void OnPointerExit(PointerEventData eventData) { // 直接判断该组件是否包含鼠标指针 if (isMouseOver) { bool exitedBecauseOfDropdown = IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown(eventData); if (!exitedBecauseOfDropdown) { isMouseOver = false; } } } private bool IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown(PointerEventData eventData) { // 如果Dropdown组件是被激活的（比如打开了选项列表） if (dropdown != null && dropdown.transform.gameObject.activeInHierarchy) { // 检查当前鼠标指向的对象是否属于Dropdown的子对象 GameObject currentPointerTarget = eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject; if (currentPointerTarget != null && (currentPointerTarget.transform.IsChildOf(dropdown.transform) || currentPointerTarget.transform == dropdown.transform)) { return true; } } return false; } } \`\`\` 代码中\`IsExitedBecauseOfDropdown\`方法用于判断是否因为Dropdown而触发\`OnPointerExit\`。当Dropdown是激活状态时，我们会检查当前鼠标所在的对象是否属于Dropdown组件或其子组件。 通过这种方式，如果是因为鼠标进入Dropdown的选项列表造成的\`OnPointerExit\`，\`isMouseOver\`将保持为\`true\`。如果鼠标离开是因为其他原因，那么\`isMouseOver\`将被设置为\`false\`。"},{"prompt":"我点击dropdown ， eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject得到的是 canvas 的 blocker ，不太对 这个情况怎么处理","completion":"当Dropdown组件展开时，Unity会创建一个全覆盖画布的“blocker”对象，用来在点击下拉列表之外的地方时关闭列表。这个blocker对象是\`Canvas\`的一部分，它会阻挡其他UI元素的点击事件。这就是为什么\`eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject\`可能返回blocker对象的原因。 要检测\`OnPointerExit\`事件是否是由于点击Dropdown导致的，你需要检查当前激活的Dropdown列表是否是导致退出的原因。因为blocker的存在，你不能直接通过\`eventData.pointerCurrentRaycast.gameObject\`来判断鼠标是否退出了Dropdown。 这里有一种方法来处理这个情况： 1. 监听Dropdown的\`onValueChanged\`事件，以便于当Dropdown被打开或关闭时能够被通知。 2. 设置一个布尔变量，用来跟踪Dropdown是否处于展开状态。 以下是实现这个逻辑的示例代码： \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; using UnityEngine.UI; public class YourComponent : MonoBehaviour, IPointerExitHandler { public Dropdown dropdown; private bool isDropdownExpanded; private void Awake() { // 初始化监听Dropdown值变化的事件 if (dropdown != null) { dropdown.onValueChanged.AddListener(HandleDropdownValueChanged); } } private void OnDestroy() { // 移除监听事件以防止内存泄露 if (dropdown != null) { dropdown.onValueChanged.RemoveListener(HandleDropdownValueChanged); } } private void HandleDropdownValueChanged(int value) { // Dropdown可以通过检查其下拉列表的激活状态来判断是否被展开 isDropdownExpanded = dropdown.transform.Find(\\"Dropdown List\\") != null; } public void OnPointerExit(PointerEventData eventData) { if (isDropdownExpanded) { // 如果Dropdown展开了，忽略OnPointerExit事件 return; } // 在这里处理正常的PointerExit逻辑 // 例如，设置你的isMouseOver变量或其他相关业务逻辑 } } \`\`\` 在这个代码中，我们为Dropdown注册了一个\`onValueChanged\`事件监听器，当其值改变时（意味着打开或关闭），我们检查\`Dropdown List\`是否存在来确定Dropdown是否处于展开状态。然后，在\`OnPointerExit\`方法中，我们使用这个信息来决定是否忽略\`PointerExit\`事件，因为如果\`isDropdownExpanded\`为真，意味着目前有一个Dropdown列表是展开的，而blocker是活跃的，这可能就是造成退出事件的真正原因。"},{"prompt":"Demande d'emploi dans un dépôt pharmaceutique entant que informaticien","completion":"Objet : Candidature au poste d'informaticien au sein de votre dépôt pharmaceutique Madame, Monsieur, Titulaire d'un diplôme en informatique et passionné par ce domaine, je me permets de vous adresser ma candidature pour le poste d'informaticien au sein de votre dépôt pharmaceutique.

What's that? Isn't that line not in the script? Is it there? No, it's not, it's not in the script.\\" It was a line that had never been heard before. However, all the actors in the reading room, except for him, remained calm. \\"An ad-lib? Well, Janghwan hyung does create his own lines when analyzing characters.\\" \\"He must have prepared an ad-lib this time too, right? Some of the lines he improvised like that were adopted, weren't they?\\" It wasn't strange at all. Of course, the writer Lee Wol-seon, who was twirling her pen, had no intention of intervening. \\"Does it amplify the awkwardness, or something like that? Did he analyze it that way? Not bad.\\" It didn't stand out from the scene. Above all. \\"I'm curious to see how he'll react. Well, he'll probably take it lightly.\\" They wanted to see how Kang Woo-jin would respond to the ad-lib. There was no doubt. It was Kang Woo-jin, the 'monster rookie' who was revered. Such a common ad-lib wouldn't shake him. However. \\"Wow, crazy. Are we just going with this? Why isn't anyone stopping it?\\" \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door.\\" Woo-jin's thoughts halted. \\"Wait a minute. What am I supposed to do with this? Huh?\\" He tried to maintain a calm face, but a hint of panic inevitably crept into Woo-jin's eyes as he looked at the top actor Jung Janghwan sitting in front of him. At that moment. \\"Huh?\\" The sign language expert sitting to the right of writer Lee Wol-seon felt something from Woo-jin's face. \\"...Troubled? Or something similar. I'm sure, those eyes. It's what you see from people who use sign language when they find it hard to communicate.\\" At the whisper, writer Lee Wol-seon turned her gaze to Woo-jin. However, she couldn't find any signs of trouble or panic in Kang Woo-jin at the moment. But. \\"There must be something that only an expert can see.\\" The sign language expert would be more certain here. Kang Woo-jin was acting as \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door.\\" Therefore, writer Lee Wol-seon focused on something else. \\"Still... to be able to express such subtle eye movements that only a sign language expert would notice—\\" It was Kang Woo-jin's acting. \\"An ad-lib thrown suddenly, but to bring out such detailed aspects in an instant? As expected, his technique is top-notch.\\" Then, Jung Janghwan threw another ad-lib line. \\"Don't look at me like that. It gives me the creeps. Please, I'm asking you.\\" \\"......\\" But Woo-jin still did not open his mouth, maintaining a calm expression. However, there was a change. His mouth twitched slightly. It was similar to mumbling. His lips quivered faintly. The sign language expert whispered immediately. \\"Genius. He's pondering something.\\" Jung Janghwan frowned and made a gesture of taking out a phone towards Kang Woo-jin at the opposite end. \\"Okay, I understand. I don't know why you're doing this to me, but since you seem to keep doing it, I'll report it now.\\" Here, Kang Woo-jin, who had been twitching his mouth, suddenly stopped. He tilted his head slightly and then nodded. It looked as if he understood what was being said. Then. -Swish. For the first time, Kang Woo-jin's hands moved. It wasn't a grand action. Clear but brief. It lasted only a few seconds. Then, Woo-jin blinked his eyes at Jung Janghwan and showed his last hand movement. He clenched his right hand into a fist. He brought that fist close to his nose. The direction was with the thumb towards the nose. The actors watching this thought. \\"It's sign language. Well done, it doesn't look unnatural at all at first glance. Practice... no, wait. Practice? This is an ad-lib that's not in the script right now? What's going on?\\" Each of them silently expressed their admiration or confusion. \\"He does sign language so smoothly that it's confusing. How much did he practice? That's impressive. But was that movement pre-arranged?\\" \\"An ad-lib was thrown, and sign language came out right away?\\" Regardless, Kang Woo-jin, \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door,\\" with his fist against his nose. \\"......\\" Smiled. It was a completely different, radiantly bright smile. A smile of the happiest kind that one could have when bathed in warm sunlight, showing teeth. It was the first time an expression appeared on his stiff face. Upon this, Jung Janghwan thought. 'The first sign language, but it's not in the script.' There was no way to know the sign language that came out as an ad-lib from \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door,\\" and as 'Song Tae-hyung,' he spoke what he felt at the moment. \\"What, what? Why are you laughing? Putting a fist to your nose—is that mocking me?\\" However, Kang Woo-jin's smile, with his fist against his nose, grew even deeper. Writer Lee Wol-seon was slightly distracted by Woo-jin's smile and then thought. 'That kid, he can smile so brightly.' Suddenly, she asked the sign language expert sitting on her right. \\"It looks like sign language. What does that mean?\\" The sign language expert with her mouth slightly open replied with a question. \\"Kang Woo-jin's sign language skills are impressive... I didn't expect such a beautiful smile. Is this scene, perhaps, to show the gap between the two characters' positions?\\" \\"You could say that. Like the difference in positions that comes from a disconnected conversation.\\" The sign language expert slowly nodded and repeated the ad-lib sign language Woo-jin had just made. The end was the same, with the fist against the nose. Of course, the gesture was smaller than what Kang Woo-jin had shown. \\"In this sign language, the last part, putting the fist to the nose, means 'like.' Depending on how deeply one smiles, it can express the mood. Just now, Mr. Woo-jin smiled really beautifully, right?

And you're still a rookie.\\" \\"I attend because of the writer.\\" \\"Huh? Ah- right, right. Honestly, you don't really need to attend this reading. Your part is small. But it's good to make an impression on writer Lee Wol-seon.\\" \\"Yes, I think so too.\\" \\"You never know when and how connections in this industry might come in handy.\\" Choi Seong-geon predicted the current situation in the reading room. \\"Ugh, but everyone in the reading room, actors and staff alike, will be talking about you.\\" \\"It doesn't matter.\\" \\"Right, when have you ever cared about that?\\" At that moment. -Ding! The arriving elevator opened its doors. Meanwhile, inside the reading room for 'Freezing Romance.' The reading room, with a D-shaped table set up, was almost ready. A few supporting actors had already arrived, and dozens of staff members were present, along with five or six reporters. The funny thing was. \\"Are you sure Kang Woo-jin is coming?\\" \\"Yeah, I told you. I asked the assistant director several times. If you really don't believe it, Kim reporter, you can go and ask again.\\" \\"You're lucky. There was a lot of talk about whether Kang Woo-jin would come to the reading or not, and now we get to see him the day after the scoop.\\" Everyone was talking about Kang Woo-jin. \\"Did you see the search sites? Seriously, the entertainment news is all about Woo-jin.\\" \\"It makes sense. There's a bit of national pride involved, but it's the first time in the history of the film industry.\\" \\"But it's really amazing, how did he land the lead role in that field? Does he have a strong backer?\\" \\"Some articles say he's from a chaebol family. Acting, vocals, even Japanese. They say he received intense early education.\\" Reporters, staff, and actors were all buzzing with conversation. \\"Wow, Kang Woo-jin. I'm jealous, so jealous. When will I ever get to go abroad?\\" \\"First, you need to break away from your supporting role image in the domestic market, don't you?\\" \\"You're in the same boat.\\" \\"Anyway, the internet and SNS are all talking about Kang Woo-jin. It'll last a while. I wonder if he'll start ignoring other actors.\\" \\"I heard he's got a good personality.\\" At that moment. -Swish. The glass door slowly opened, and a man with a cold expression on his face entered. It was Kang Woo-jin. As a result, everyone in the reading room turned their attention to Woo-jin at the entrance, and after scanning them for a moment, Woo-jin bowed his head and murmured softly. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woo-jin.\\" Suddenly, the reading room fell silent. At that moment, a reporter who was a bit dazed looking at Woo-jin had a phone in sight. It was showing the YouTube channel 'Kang Woo-jin's Side Character,' probably because they were about to meet Kang Woo-jin. What was interesting was. [Channel Name: Kang Woo-jin's Side Character] [Subscribers: 509,000] [Videos: 2] The subscriber count had 'exploded.' Around that time, outside the reading room. Choi Seong-geon, who was wandering down the corridor, was still on the phone. Calls were pouring in like crazy. His current caller was Kim So-hyang from Netflix Korea. \\"The promotional schedule in Japan is on the 26th?\\" The promotional schedule in Japan referred to the event disguised as a production announcement that she had mentioned before. It was planned in collaboration with Netflix Japan. Anyway, in response to Choi Seong-geon's question, Kim So-hyang, the general director on the other end of the phone, answered. \\"Yes, next month is fine too, but we've agreed with Netflix Japan that it's best to schedule these things as soon as possible. We need to strike while the iron is hot. Of course, if Woo-jin's schedule doesn't fit, we'll have to adjust.\\" \\"No, next month will be even harder. Woo-jin's schedule next month is twice as busy as now. Hmm, the 26th.\\" It was just a few days away. Soon, Choi Seong-geon, who had been calculating in his head, spoke up. \\"There are a few schedules set for the 26th, but what about Hwarin's side?\\" \\"It's just a one-day schedule, so she said it's fine. If it's too difficult, you can arrive in Japan separately from Hwarin. You can join us there.\\" \\"No, it's better to go together if possible. I'll try to coordinate it.\\" \\"Oh! Thank you, then shall I prepare for the 26th as planned?\\" \\"Yes, General Director.\\" After ending the call, Choi Seong-geon opened his diary. It was already packed without any gaps. He sighed softly and turned to the next page to write something. 'Arrive in Japan on the 26th. Digest the promotional schedule for 'Boyfriend Material' in Japan. Then—on the 27th, 'Ametalk show!' and a meeting with Director Kyotaro.' He closed the diary and muttered to himself. \\"And on the 30th, the official recording of 'Ametalk show!'\\" In short, Kang Woo-jin's upcoming schedule in Japan was not just one day, but a total of four days. The 30th was the filming of 'Ametalk show!' and it would be cumbersome to travel back and forth. Having come to a conclusion, Choi Seong-geon now made a call himself. The person on the other end was the production manager of 'Island of the Missing.' \\"Yes, Manager. Sorry for the late contact. I was sorting out the schedule. Yes, yes. For now, I'll give you the exact details after I meet Director Kyotaro in Japan. Yes. But there shouldn't be any issues with the overseas location schedule, and we'll try to fit the filming schedule as smoothly as possible.\\" After a lengthy explanation, Choi Seong-geon threw in his closing remark. \\"Yes, then I'll see you after I return from Japan. Yes. Ah- I'll call Director Kwon directly about that part. Yes-\\" -Click. Feeling like he had put out the urgent fires, Choi Seong-geon let out a long sigh. \\"Phew, this is even busier than when I was with Hyeyeon. Well, she never had overlapping work like this. It's chaotic but fun.\\" At that moment. -Woong, woong woong. The phone rang again. Soon, after checking the caller ID, Choi Seong-geon tilted his head slightly. \\"Director Kim Do-hee?\\" The caller was Director Kim Do-hee of 'Drug Dealer.' Then, thinking 'Maybe he's calling to congratulate Woo-jin,' Choi Seong-geon answered the phone. \\"Yes, Director. Haha, have you had your meal?\\" \\"No, I have to eat now. But more importantly, Mr. Choi Dae-pyo.\\" However, what Director Kim Do-hee said on the phone was not a congratulation. \\"We're going to have a blind screening of 'Drug Dealer' next week.\\" \\"...A blind screening?\\" A blind screening was a schedule at the end of the post-production work of a film. It's a screening where only the production team, including the director, and the actors gather. To appreciate the finished product, so to speak. Which meant. \\"Yes. A blind screening. If possible, I'd like you to come with Woo-jin. It's important.\\" The release of 'Drug Dealer' was just around the corner. < Fireworks (6) > The end"},{"prompt":"< 출국 (3) > ‘남사친’과 ‘마약상’이 동시에 오픈된다? 최성건을 가만히 보던 우진이 차분하게 되물었다. “동시에 말입니까?” 그러자 꽁지머리 최성건은 작은 미소를 띠며 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래, 뭐- 확정은 아니긴 해. 내 추측이고.” 여기서 우진은 이곳저곳에서 들은 것을 토대로 계산이란 걸 해봤다. “‘남사친’ 예정일은 10월로 들었습니다.” “맞아, 지금이 8월 중후반이니까 얼추 한 달하고 조금 남았지. 근데 어제 너 ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 대본리딩할 때, 김도희 감독이 직접 전화했었다. 다음 주쯤에 블라인드 시사회 열자고.” 블라인드 뭐? 진중한 얼굴의 우진은 ‘블라인드 시사회’란 말이 헷갈렸다. 어디서 들어본 것 같긴 한데 은근 낯설다. 어디였지? 그러다 번뜩 답을 떠올리는 그. ‘아- 맞다, ‘흥신소’ 때였나?’ 그랬다. 분명, ‘흥신소’의 편집이 끝났을 때도 블라인드 시사회를 했었다. 얼추 느낌은 영화에 참여한 관계자들만 모여서 완성품을 관람하는 것. 그렇다면 ‘마약상’의 편집이 끝났다는 거? 좀 빠르지 않나? 뭐, 아는 게 아직 많진 않아도 감이 그랬다. “좀 빠르지 않습니까?” “맞아. 상업 영화 후반 작업치고는 상당히? 다만, ‘정확히 편집이 완료됐다.’ 그런 건 아닌 것 같고. 대충 90%쯤 결과물이 나왔다 싶어. 그래도 빠른 건 맞아. 있는 일이지, 감독이 뭐에 꽂혀서 편집에 목숨 갈아 넣는 건.” “고생하셨겠네요.” “여튼 블라인드 시사회도 원랜 9월 중순이었던 걸 당긴 것 같어. 배우들 스케줄 때문에. 그렇게 되면 8월 말 블라인드 시사회, 9월 중순 전에 편집이 완료되고 뒤로 배급사 참전해서 홍보 돌려, 바삐 움직이면 10월이나 11월 안에는 영화를 건다는 결론.” 이쯤, 무심한 표정엔 변화는 없지만 우진의 내면에서 긴장감이 피어 올렸다. 까메오 역할이긴 했다만, 내가 나온 작품이 영화관에 걸린다? 물론, ‘흥신소’도 영화관에서 보긴 했다. 그런데 묘하게 다가오는 느낌이 달랐다. ‘이게 단편과 상업 영화의 차이?’ 영화제를 통해 이벤트성으로 걸리는 영화가 아닌, 실제 대중들이 각기 돈을 내고 영화 속 강우진 또는 ‘이상만’을 보는 것. ‘흥신소’와 달리 관객수가 찍히고 매출도 산출된다. 과연, 이런 기분이 성적에 관한 압박 뭐 그런 건가 보네. 우진의 심장이 남몰래 두근거릴 무렵. “의도한 건 아니다만, 그렇게 되면 ‘남사친’하고 ‘마약상’이 겹쳐질 가능성이 커.” 그렇겠네. 두 작품이 동시에 딱 열리는 건 불가능하겠다만, 어느 쪽이 먼저 나오든 비슷한 시기일 것은 분명했다. “근데 그게 훨씬 폭발력이 좋겠다 싶어. 대중들 입장에선 골라 먹는 재미도 있을 거고. 뭣보다 네 다채로운 마스크를 뽐낼 수도 있으니까.” 설명하던 최성건의 미소가 짙어졌고. “양쪽 작품 다 네가 끼어 있고 당연히 홍보할 땐 너도 중심에 서 있을 거야. 그럼 대중들은 궁금하겠지, 이슈 덩어리가 비대해진 너의 결과물이 거의 같은 시기 두 개나 나와줬으니까.” 검지로 우진을 가리킨 그가. “‘이상만’과 ‘한인호’. 장르부터, 풍기는 존재감 그리고 냄새가 판이한 두 인물.” 미래를 상상하며 읊조렸다. “과연 대중들이 어떻게 받아들일지 궁금하지 않냐?” 이후. ‘남사친’과 ‘마약상’ 건을 정리한 최성건은 며칠 뒤 있을 일본 스케줄로 주제를 바꿨다. 남들이야 해외파니 유학파니 떠들지만, 정작 알맹이 속 진짜 강우진은 해외가 난생처음이었다. ‘내가 첫 비행기를 배우가 돼서 타보다니.’ 기대가 안 된다면 거짓말이었다. 비록 가까운 일본이라도 해외는 해외니까. 허나, 강우진의 기대감은 최성건의 브리핑을 들으며 와사삭 부서졌다. 왜? “우진아, 아쉽게도 일본 가서도 쉴 시간은 없겠다.” 놀 시간 따위 1도 없었으니까. 아니, 오히려 한국에 있을 때보다 더 빡빡한 스케줄이었다. “일단 26일 늦은 아침에 일본 도착, 바로 ‘넷플렉스 재팬’으로 넘어간 뒤에 간단히 식사, 행사 관련 브리핑 듣고 오후에 행사, 다음 날은······” 심지어 이게 예상 동선이었다. “실제 확정 스케줄이 나오면 아마 더 빼곡해질 거다.” 강우진은 절로 한숨이 나왔지만, 연예인들의 해외 스케줄은 평소보다 더 타이트한 게 보통이었다. 뭐, 어쩌겠어? 애초 놀러 가는 게 아니었으니 우진은 피어오르던 흥분에 찬물을 끼얹었다. 그런 강우진을 보며 최성건이 약간 걱정했고. “괜찮겠냐? 요즘 컨디션은 좀 어때? 넌 표정으로는 안 드러나니까.” 컨셉질을 진하게 만든 우진이 근엄하게 답했다. “문제없습니다.” 좀 빡세다 싶으면 아공간에 들락거려도 되니까. 어쨌든 출국까지 약 4일 남은 일본 스케줄에 관해 브리핑을 마친 최성건과 우진은. -스윽. 바로 다음 스케줄을 위해 회사를 나섰다. 이 시각, 강우진이 참여한 두 작품은 편집에 미친 듯이 열중하고 있었다. “이 컷은 두 인물은 좋은데, 주변 벚꽃이 좀 덜 날리는 것 같은데요. 다음 건 어때요?” 최근 크랭크업을 알린, 국내를 뒤집은 제작발표회를 열었던 ‘남사친’. 제작발표회 뒤 신동춘 감독이 바로 편집에 돌입한 것. ‘남사친’은 일반적인 단막보다 할 게 많았다. 4부로 화수가 보통보다 많았고 뭣보다 OST부터 일본 넷플렉스 런칭 등등, 당연하겠지만 판이 커진 만큼 손이 많이 가야 했다. 한마디로 신동춘 감독과 제작진의 영혼을 갈아야 했다. 그리고. “음악 감독님. 생각해 봤는데, 여기 ‘이상만’ 죽는 컷. BGM을 좀 바꿨으면 싶어요.” “지금이요?” 블라인드 시사회가 코 앞인 ‘마약상’이었다. “지금은 약간 슬픔 이미지가 떠오르거든요? 근데 전 ‘이상만’이 마지막까지 제대로 된 악역이었으면 좋겠어요.” “웅장함과 충격이 더 좋겠다 이 말씀입니까?” “맞아요, 가는 순간까지 개새끼였으면 하는 마음?” “흠.” “그런 게 더 대중들 머릿속에 제대로 박힐 거야.” 두 작품 모두 각자의 스케줄에 맞춰 편집에 매달리는 중이었다. 이제 시작했다는 것과 마무리 중이라는 것만 다를 뿐. 이게 단막과 장편의 차이겠지. 그 간극 덕분에 비슷한 시기에 오픈할 수 있다는 거고. 그렇게 22일 저물고 23일 일요일이 밝았다. 아침부터 ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 측이 보도 자료를 돌렸다. 어제 대본리딩이 끝났으니 자연스러운 흐름이긴 했다. 여기서 특이한 것은. 『[스타포토]스타작가 이월선 작가의 ‘얼어죽는 연애’, 정식 대본리딩 시작됐다!/ 사진』 그들이 돌린 홍보 기사에 실린 사진엔 대부분 강우진이 포함돼 있다는 것. ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 주연들과 같은 컷에 담긴 강우진. 이유야 심플했다. 배역은 조·단역이지만 현재 국내에서 가장 잘 팔리는 배우였으니까. 『‘얼어죽는 연애’ 난다긴다하는 탑들과 나란히 앉은 강우진···그래도 존재감 안 밀리네/ 사진』 현재로선 남주인 정장환보다 더 홍보력이 높지 않을까? 뭐가 됐든 ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 측은 우진의 모습은 흘리지만, 그가 맡은 배역에 관한 정보는 차단했다. 궁금증을 유발하기 위함이었다. 『‘쿄타로 감독’도 반한 강우진, ‘얼어죽는 연애’에서 무슨 역? 관계자 측“예상치 못 한 배역일 것”』 하지만 우진이 맡은 배역에 관해선, 반전이나 의외 또는 생각지도 못했다는 키워드를 사용했다. 이렇듯 ‘얼어죽는 연애’로 강우진의 이름이 뿌려지곤 있다만. 『[스타톡]‘일본 진출’ 강우진에게 광고계 관심 쏠린다』 『세계적 베스트셀러의 실사화 영화 ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’에 유일한 한국 배우 ‘강우진’』 사실, 이미 국내는 ‘남사친’의 제작발표회 이후로 포화상태였다. 날이 갈수록 강우진의 위세는 커질 수밖에 없었다. 『일본의 거장 ‘쿄타로 감독’과 한국의 거장 ‘권기택 감독’, 두 거장을 강우진은 어떻게 홀렸나?』 『[팩트체크]등장부터 지금까지 ‘최초’만 써대는 강우진, 다음은 어떤 행보 보일까 업계 주목』 『국내 넘어 일본까지 핫한 강우진···그의 너튜브 채널 ‘강우진 부캐’, 오픈 며칠 만에 구독자 50만 돌파』 현재도 쏟아지는 기사엔 수많은 단어들이 포함됐다. ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’, 쿄타로 감독, ‘남사친’, ‘강우진 부캐’채널, 한량 등등등. 『[스타픽]연기만 괴물이 아니었네? ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널에서 선보인 강우진의 일본어에 대중들 입이 쩍』 언론으로서는 살판 날 수밖에 없었다. 쓸 껀덕지가 무궁무진했으니까. 여론도 별반 다르진 않았다. 『강우진의 심상치 않은 노래 실력에 누리꾼들“아니 왜 노래까지 잘하는 거야?”』 하루에도 일일이 열거할 수 없을 정도의 반응들이 폭발한다. 이즈음. -!티저!드디어 떴어요, 강우진과 화린의 달달한 로코드라마 보고 가실게요!(‘남사친 티저’｜넷플렉스 코리아 ‘남사친’의 첫 티저영상이 넷플렉스 코리아 공식 채널에 업로드됐다. 15초 정도로 매우 짧은 러닝타임이었지만. -조회수 52만 회 조회수는 어마무시한 속도였다. 당연히 화린의 팬덤 영향도 있겠다만, 강우진의 화력이 현재는 더 크다 봐도 무방했다. -ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ티저만 봐도 달달하다 -색감 뭐임??? ㅈㄴ예쁘다 이대로만 나오면 좋겠어......... -둘 다 교복 입은 거??!! 뭐야? 왜 벌써 떨리는 거야!! -노잼확정 -ㅋㅋㅋㅋ왘ㅋㅋㅋ강우진 솔까 로코는 안 어울릴 것 같았는데 왜 찰떡이지?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -그래서!! 언제 오픈인데요!!! 커밍순 말고 날짜를 말하라고!! -이거 초반에 화린 극성팬들이 ㅈㄹ떨었었는뎈ㅋㅋㅋ내가 봐선 화린이랑 강우진 잘 어울림ㅋㅋㅋ -누가봐도 망할 듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -단막말고 16부 미니로 내줘! 당장! -근데 강우진 국내랑 일본 스케줄 전부 소화가능하냐?ㅋㅋㅋ · · · · 한편, 일본에서도 ‘남사친’의 티저가 공개됐다. 출처는 일본 넷플렉스. 이에 일본 대중들의 관심은 전과는 달랐다. 아니, 폭발적이라는 표현이 어울렸다. ‘강우진’이란 한국 신인을 아는 사람이 기하급수적으로 늘어났고, 그의 이름은 일본 어디에서든 거론되는 중이었다. 『강우진의「프로파일러 한량」인기 껑충』 다만, 일본에선 다른 소식도 시끌벅적했다. 곧, 강우진과 화린이 일본에 입국한다는 것과. 『뜨거운 「강우진」과 엘라니의「화린」 26일 일본 입국 확정』 그 화제의 ‘한국의 신인 배우’ 강우진이 일본의 국민 토크쇼. 『「‘아메토크 show!’」측 “이번 K드라마 위크 관련으로 게스트는 강우진”』 ‘아메토크 show!’에 나온다는 것이었다. 8월 26일, 수요일. 장소는 도쿄 국제공항이라고도 불리는 일본의 하네다 공항이었다. 과연, 규모가 커서 그런지 아침임에도 공항에 몰린 인파는 많았다. 어딜 봐도 북적인다. 방금 입국한 또는 출국할 사람들. 국제공항답게 외국인도 많았고, 뭣보다 한국인도 자주 보였다. 그중에서 유독. “저기 저 무리들 기자 아닌가?” “어디? 아- 맞네? 뭐지?” “연예인 오나 봐!” 카메라를 든 기자들이 심심치 않게 많이 보였다. 둘 셋으로 뭉쳐 있거나 혼자 있거나. 어느 쪽이든 기자들은 시간을 보며 한 곳을 향해 달려가는 모양새였다. 그 수가 적지 않았기에 공항 속 인파들의 눈길을 끌은 것. 기자뿐만이 아니었다. “근데 뭔가- 사람들도 저쪽으로 가지 않아?” “그러네. 이거 백퍼 연예인이다! 저기저기, 공항 가드들도 따라가네.” “우리도 가볼래? 버스 시간 좀 남았잖아?” 일반인들부터 공항 관계자들도 기자들이 뛰는 방향으로 움직이고 있었다. 그럴 때. ‘오- 일본 도착. 한국에서 진짜 금방이네?’ 강우진 역시 하네다 공항에 있었다. 아니, 방금 도착했다. 과하지 않은 헤어에 메이크업은 적당히 정돈된 모습. 당연히 그를 제외한 인원도 넘쳤다. 최성건과 김대영을 포함한 bw 엔터 팀들, 넷플렉스 코리아 쪽, 그리고. “우진씨, 같이 움직여야 한대요.” 방금 강우진의 옆에 붙은 화린과 그녀의 팀들까지. 퍽 많은 인원이 짐을 챙기고 있었다. 이유야 간단. 오늘부터 강우진과 화린은 일본 스케줄을 소화할 예정이었으니까. 곧, 강우진은. ‘아, 일단 표정관리.’ 첫 비행기에 첫 일본이었지만, 지척에 붙은 화린을 보며 흥분을 애써 가라앉혔다. “네. 여기서부터 같이 가는 겁니까?” “그렇대요. 근데 따로 찍히는 것보다는 투샷이 좋긴 해요. 국내나 일본이나 기사 쓰기도 편할 거고.” 처음 듣는 정보였으나 강우진은 아는 척을 시전한다. “그렇겠네요.” 덤덤하게 읊조리는 강우진을 보며, 긴 머리를 쓸어 넘긴 화린은 속으로 아쉬움을 토하는 중이었다. ‘아까워, 스케줄이 좀만 더 널널했으면 막 우진님한테 맛집 소개도 해주고 하는 건데.’ 이미 일본에서 콘서트만 물리도록 연 화린이었다. 그렇기에 맛집도 빠싹했다. 그러나 우진과 같이 할 시간이 부족했다. 내 최최최최애와 난생처음 온 해외 스케줄인데 너무 미적지근했다. 덕분에 화린은 얼굴에 티는 안내지만 계속해서 아쉬움이 커졌고. 이쯤. “다 챙겼으면 움직입시다!” 강우진과 화린을 포함된 모든 팀이 비행기에서 내리기 시작했다. 공항으로 통하는 입구 쪽에는 ‘남사친’팀을 기다리는 인원들이 대기하고 있었다. 넷플렉스 재팬 쪽이나, 공항 관계자들 등등. 화린과 나란히 움직이는 우진은 약간 의아했다. ‘뭔가 사람이 좀 많지 않냐??’ 모이는 인원들이 너무 과하다 생각했으니까. 원래도 수십 명은 넘었는데, 일본 하네다 공항에 도착하니 그 수가 두 배는 늘었다. 거기다. “대영씨하고 수환씨! 양쪽에 서요, 양쪽에.” 입국장으로 이동하는 사이, 최성건은 장수환과 지원 나온 김대영을 우진과 화린의 양쪽에 배치했다. 그런 둘을 또 한 번 대여섯의 덩치 좋은 가드들이 감쌌다. 뭐지? 어느새 강우진의 주변으론 곰 같은 사내들만 열댓 명에 가까웠고, 뒤쪽으론 수십 명 인파가 졸졸졸 따라온다. 묘한 기분이 드는 강우진. ‘뭔가 벽에 둘러싸인 기분인데- 이러고 나가면 시선 집중되지 않나?’ 모든 게 처음인 우진은 옆에 선 화린을 힐끔했다. 그녀는 별수롭지 않게 핸드폰을 보고 있었다. 그때였다. “아, 왔다.” 화린이 뜬금 고개를 들었다. 덩달아 강우진의 시선도 정면으로 움직였다. 정면엔 입국장의 문이 천천히 열리고 있었다. 그런데. ‘응? 뭔가 있는데?’ 입국장 입구 너머 울렁거리는 게 보이는 강우진이었다. 아니, 저건 사람들인가? 그러한 생각을 우진이 했을 때 입국장의 문이 활짝 열렸다. 동시에. -파바바바박! -파바바바바바박!! 미친 듯이 번개가 치기 시작했다. 아니, 플래시 세례였다. 눈이 멀 것 같다. 갑자기 뭐지? 왜? 무슨 일이냐 이거?? 눈이 멀듯 터지는 번개의 출처는 금세 확인할 수 있었다. 강우진의 눈앞엔. ‘우왁! 뭐냐?? 기, 기자들??!’ 백여 명의 일본 기자들이 몰려 있었으니까. 그들이 눌러대는 셔터에 따라 플래시가 후두둑 박힌다. -파바바바바바박!! 허나 강우진을 찍어대는 건 기자만이 아니었다. 기자들 뒤쪽 덕지덕지 몰린 수백 명이 일본어를 다급히 뱉어대며, 핸드폰으로 강우진을 찍어대고 있었다. “왔어!!” “나왔다!!!” “저기저기!!” 다 합치면 500명은 거뜬히 넘어 보였다. < 출국 (3) > 끝","completion":"< Departure (3) > \\"Both 'Boyfriend Material' and 'Drug Dealer' are opening at the same time?\\" Kang Woo-jin asked Choi Seong-geon calmly. \\"At the same time?\\" Choi Seong-geon, with his ponytail, nodded with a small smile. \\"Yeah, well, it's not confirmed yet. It's just my guess.\\" Based on what he had heard here and there, Woo-jin did some calculations. \\"I heard 'Boyfriend Material' is scheduled for October.\\" \\"Right, it's mid to late August now, so it's just over a month away. But yesterday, when you were at the script reading for 'Freezing Romance,' Director Kim Do-hee called. He wants to have a blind screening next week.\\" Blind what? Woo-jin, with a serious face, was confused by the term \\"blind screening.\\" It sounded vaguely familiar but also strange. Where had he heard it? Then, he suddenly remembered. \\"Ah, right, was it during 'Private Detective'?\\" That's right. There had been a blind screening when the editing for 'Private Detective' was finished. It was a gathering of people involved in the movie to watch the finished product. So, the editing for 'Drug Dealer' was done? Wasn't that a bit early? Well, he didn't know much yet, but that was his feeling. \\"Isn't that a bit early?\\" \\"Yes. It's quite early for a commercial film's post-production. But it doesn't seem like 'the editing is completely finished.' It's more like about 90% of the result is there. Still, it's fast. It happens, directors sometimes get obsessed with editing.\\" \\"They must have worked hard.\\" \\"Anyway, the blind screening was originally scheduled for mid-September, but it seems to have been moved up because of the actors' schedules. So, if the blind screening is at the end of August, editing is completed before mid-September, and then the distributors join in for promotion, if we move quickly, we can release the movie in October or November.\\" At this point, although there was no change in his indifferent expression, tension rose within Woo-jin. It was a cameo role, but a film he was in would be shown in theaters? Of course, he had seen 'Private Detective' in theaters. But the feeling that came to him was different. \\"Is this the difference between a short film and a commercial movie?\\" Unlike a film shown at a festival as an event, this was a real movie that the public would pay to see Kang Woo-jin or 'Lee Sang-man' in. Unlike 'Private Detective,' the number of viewers and revenue would be recorded. Indeed, this feeling must be the pressure related to performance. As Woo-jin's heart secretly raced. \\"It's not intentional, but if it happens, there's a good chance that 'Boyfriend Material' and 'Drug Dealer' will overlap.\\" That made sense. It was impossible for both works to open exactly at the same time, but it was clear that whichever came first, they would be close in timing. \\"But I think that would have much more impact. From the public's point of view, there's the fun of choosing. Above all, you can show off your diverse masks.\\" Choi Seong-geon's smile deepened as he explained. \\"You're involved in both works, and of course, you'll be at the center of the promotion. Then the public will be curious, as the results from you, who has become a hot topic, are coming out almost at the same time.\\" Pointing at Woo-jin with his index finger. \\"'Lee Sang-man' and 'Han In-ho.' Two characters with completely different genres, presence, and vibes.\\" He mused, imagining the future. \\"Aren't you curious how the public will receive them?\\" Afterward. Having sorted out the matters regarding 'Boyfriend Material' and 'Drug Dealer,' Choi Seong-geon switched the topic to the upcoming schedule in Japan a few days later. Others might talk about going abroad or studying overseas, but the real Kang Woo-jin was going overseas for the first time in his life. \\"I'm taking my first flight as an actor.\\" It would be a lie to say he wasn't excited. Even though it was just nearby Japan, overseas was still overseas. However, Woo-jin's excitement crumbled as he listened to Choi Seong-geon's briefing. Why? \\"Woo-jin, unfortunately, you won't have any time to rest in Japan.\\" There was absolutely no time to play. In fact, the schedule was even tighter than when he was in Korea. \\"First, you arrive in Japan late in the morning on the 26th, then head straight to 'Netflix Japan' for a quick meal, listen to a briefing related to the event, and then the event in the afternoon, the next day is...\\" Even this was just the expected route. \\"When the actual confirmed schedule comes out, it will probably be even busier.\\" Kang Woo-jin let out an involuntary sigh, but it was common for celebrities' overseas schedules to be tighter than usual. Well, what could he do? Since it wasn't a leisure trip, Woo-jin poured cold water on his rising excitement. Seeing Woo-jin like this, Choi Seong-geon was a bit worried. \\"Are you okay? How's your condition these days? You don't show it on your face.\\" Woo-jin, who had been putting on a strong front, answered solemnly. \\"There's no problem.\\" If it got too tough, he could always slip into his pocket dimension. Anyway, with about four days left until departure, Woo-jin and Choi Seong-geon finished briefing about the Japan schedule. -Swish. They left the company for the next schedule. At this time, the two works involving Kang Woo-jin were intensely focused on editing. \\"This cut is good for the two characters, but the cherry blossoms in the background seem to be falling too sparsely. How about the next one?\\" 'Boyfriend Material,' which had recently announced the end of filming and held a groundbreaking production announcement in Korea, had Director Shin Dong-chun dive into editing right after. 'Boyfriend Material' had more to do than a typical single-episode drama. With four episodes, there was more content than usual, and above all, from the OST to the launch with Netflix Japan, naturally, the larger scale meant more work was needed. In short, Director Shin Dong-chun and the production team had to grind their souls. And. \\"Music Director. I've been thinking, for this cut where 'Lee Sang-man' dies. I'd like to change the BGM.\\" \\"Now?\\" It was 'Drug Dealer,' with the blind screening just around the corner. \\"Right now, it gives off a bit of a sad image. But I'd like 'Lee Sang-man' to be a proper villain until the end.\\" \\"You mean more grandeur and shock would be better?\\" \\"Exactly, I want him to be a bastard until the very end.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" \\"That will stick in the public's mind better.\\" Both works were busy editing according to their respective schedules. The only difference was whether they had just started or were in the final stages. This was the difference between a short and a feature film. Thanks to this gap, they could open around the same time. And so, the 22nd day ended, and Sunday the 23rd dawned. From the morning, the team from 'Freezing Romance' distributed press releases. It was a natural flow since the script reading had ended the day before. What was peculiar was. \\"[Star Photo] Writer Lee Wol-seon's 'Freezing Romance' officially begins script reading! / Photos\\" The promotional articles they released included photos that mostly featured Kang Woo-jin. Kang Woo-jin captured in the same shots as the leads of 'Freezing Romance.' The reason was simple.

The interest of the Japanese public was different from before. No, the term \\"explosive\\" was more fitting. The number of people who knew the Korean rookie 'Kang Woo-jin' had grown exponentially, and his name was being mentioned everywhere in Japan. \\"[Star Talk] The popularity of 'Profiler Hanryang' featuring Kang Woo-jin skyrockets\\" However, there was other buzzing news in Japan. Soon, Kang Woo-jin and Hwarin would be entering Japan. \\"[Star Talk] The hot 'Kang Woo-jin' and Elani's 'Hwarin' confirmed to enter Japan on the 26th\\" And the 'new Korean actor' Kang Woo-jin would appear on Japan's national talk show. \\"[Star Talk] 'Ametalk show!' states 'This week's K-drama Week guest is Kang Woo-jin'\\" He would be on 'Ametalk show!' August 26th, Wednesday. The location was Haneda Airport, also known as Tokyo International Airport. Indeed, due to its size, there were many people at the airport despite it being morning. Everywhere was bustling. People who had just arrived or were about to depart. As expected of an international airport, there were many foreigners, and especially many Koreans were seen. Among them, particularly. \\"Are those reporters over there?\\" \\"Where? Oh, right? What's going on?\\" \\"Must be a celebrity coming!\\" Reporters with cameras were frequently spotted. Whether in groups of two or three or alone, the reporters seemed to be rushing in one direction, looking at the time. Their numbers were significant enough to draw the attention of the crowd at the airport. But it wasn't just reporters. \\"But it seems like people are also heading that way, right?\\" \\"Yeah. This is definitely a celebrity! Look, the airport guards are following too.\\" \\"Shall we go check it out? We still have time before our bus, right?\\" Not only the general public but also airport staff were moving in the direction the reporters were running. At that time. \\"Oh, arrived in Japan. That was really quick from Korea?\\" Kang Woo-jin was also at Haneda Airport. In fact, he had just arrived. His hair was not too extravagant, and his makeup was neatly done. Naturally, the entourage with him was overflowing. The BW Entertainment team, including Choi Seong-geon and Kim Dae-young, the Netflix Korea side, and. \\"Woo-jin, we need to move together.\\" Hwarin, who had just joined Woo-jin's side, and her team as well. A large group was gathering their luggage. The reason was simple. From today, Kang Woo-jin and Hwarin were scheduled to fulfill their itinerary in Japan. Soon, Kang Woo-jin. 'Ah, first, I need to manage my expression.' It was his first flight and first time in Japan, but seeing Hwarin close by, he tried to suppress his excitement. \\"Yes. Are we moving together from here?\\" \\"That's what they said. But it's better to be photographed together than separately. It'll be easier to write articles in both Korea and Japan.\\" It was new information to Woo-jin, but he pretended to understand. \\"That makes sense.\\" Watching Woo-jin speak calmly, Hwarin, who had brushed her long hair aside, was internally expressing her regret. 'It's a shame, if only the schedule was a bit more relaxed, I could have introduced Woo-jin to some good restaurants.' Hwarin had already been to Japan for concerts countless times. Therefore, she knew all the good restaurants. However, there was not enough time to spend with Woo-jin. It was her ultimate favorite's first overseas schedule, and it was too lackluster. As a result, Hwarin's face didn't show it, but her disappointment grew. At this point. \\"If everyone's ready, let's move!\\" All teams, including Kang Woo-jin and Hwarin, began to disembark from the plane. At the entrance leading to the airport, personnel waiting for the 'Boyfriend Material' team were standing by. Netflix Japan side, airport staff, and others. Woo-jin, moving alongside Hwarin, felt a bit odd. 'Doesn't it seem like there are too many people?' He thought the gathering crowd was too excessive. There were already over a dozen people, but upon arriving at Haneda Airport in Japan, that number seemed to have doubled. And. \\"Kim Dae-young and Jang Su-hwan! Stand on both sides, both sides.\\" While moving to the immigration area, Choi Seong-geon positioned Jang Su-hwan and Kim Dae-young, who had come to support, on both sides of Woo-jin and Hwarin. The two were then surrounded by another half dozen burly guards. What's going on? Suddenly, Kang Woo-jin found himself surrounded by nearly a dozen bear-like men, and a crowd of dozens followed closely behind. Kang Woo-jin felt strangely enclosed. 'Feels like I'm surrounded by walls—won't this draw more attention if I go out like this?' Everything was new to Woo-jin, who glanced at Hwarin beside him. She seemed nonchalant, looking at her phone. That's when. \\"Ah, they're here.\\" Hwarin suddenly looked up. Woo-jin's gaze also shifted forward. In front of them, the doors to the immigration area were slowly opening. But. 'Huh? Is there something there?' Woo-jin saw something stirring beyond the entrance to the immigration area. Or was it people? As Woo-jin had that thought, the doors to the immigration area swung wide open. At the same time. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapapak!! Flashes went off like crazy. No, it was a barrage of flashes. It was blinding. Suddenly, what's going on? What's happening?? The source of the flashes was quickly identified. In front of Kang Woo-jin. 'Whoa! What's this?? Are those, reporters??!' There were about a hundred Japanese reporters swarming around. With each press of their shutters, flashes rained down. -Papapapapapapak!! But it wasn't just the reporters taking pictures of Woo-jin. Behind the reporters, hundreds of people were frantically speaking Japanese and taking photos of Kang Woo-jin with their phones. \\"They're here!!\\" \\"They've come out!!!\\" \\"Over there, over there!!\\" In total, there seemed to be easily over 500 people. < Departure (3) > The end"},{"prompt":"< 출국 (5) > 구독자 100만. 넷플렉스 재팬의 팀장급 간부가 뱉은 말은 사실이었다. 그것을 증명하듯, 꽁지머리 최성건의 옆으로 한예정이 붙었다. “대표님.” 약간 속삭이듯 읊조린 그녀가 최성건의 옆에 붙어 핸드폰을 보였다. “방금 달성했어요.” 한예정의 핸드폰 화면엔 너튜브 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널 메인이 출력되고 있었다. [채널명: 강우진 부캐] [구독자 100.1만 명] [동영상 5개] 이에 최성건의 입이 단숨에 귀에 걸렸고. “또 최초 하나 추가했네.” 무대 위 강우진에게 엄지를 추켜세웠다. 하지만 지금 한창 행사를 진행하는, 매우 유창한 일본어로 읊조리는 강우진이. “예. 저와 화린씨의 호흡은 좋았습니다. 촬영장은 시작부터 끝까지 화기애애한 분위기였고요. 기억 남는 게 있다면- 아 근데 이걸 말씀드리긴 좀 곤란합니다. 스포가 될 수 있어서.” 알 턱이 없었다. 다음 날, 아침. 어제 넷플렉스 재팬이 주관한 행사를 잘 마친 우진은, 27일 아침부터 ‘아메토크 show!’의 빼싹 마른 신조 PD와 미팅을 진행했다. 장소는 호텔 내부에 있는 레스토랑이었고, 인원은 강우진과 최성건 반대편엔 신조 PD와 작가들. “하하, 우진씨. 일본에서 보니까 더 반갑네요!” “안녕하십니까, PD님.” “아시죠? 지금 일본에서 우진씨 이름 시끄러운 거. 한량 잘 돼서 조사하던 초반이랑은 전혀 다릅니다! 커뮤니티고 SNS고 우진씨가 가장 핫해요, 거기다 어제 우진씨 일본 도착하고부터는 더 심하구요.” 신조 PD와 작가들의 눈엔 흥분이 점철됐고 빠르게 일본어를 뱉어댔다. 당연하다면 당연했다. 한량만 보고 강우진을 섭외했는데 생각지도 못한 초초대어로 성장했으니까. 완벽히 얻어걸린 느낌이니 그럴 수밖에. “그리고 아까 보니까 우진씨 너튜브 채널은 벌써 구독자 105만 명을 넘겼더라고요? 대단합니다, 진짜. 저도 나름 PD로 오래 시간을 보냈는데 이런 급격한 상승세 처음 봅니다.” 극찬에 무심함을 장착한 우진은 속으론 순수하게 기뻐하는 중이었다. ‘인정, 나도 이게 현실인가 싶습니다. 내가- 내가 100만 너튜버가 될 줄이야.’ 잠시간 어제의 전율을 상기하던 우진이 달달한 미래를 상상했다. ‘이대로면 진짜 200만은 기본이고 300만도 쉽지 않겠어? 아니다, 이건 백퍼 500만도 쌉가능.’ 그럴 때 신조 PD가 돌연 일 얘기를 꺼냈다. 이틀 뒤 있을 녹화 얘기였다. “워낙에 급작스레 일이 흘러가서 원래 잡았던 기획을 싹 갈아엎었습니다. 그만큼 추가된 부분도 많고 녹화 시간도 좀 늘어날 거예요.” “문제없습니다.” “하하, 감사합니다. 그- 오프닝이나 클로징은 보통의 그림으로 생각하시면 되고, 우진씨가 참여할 작품들 있잖습니까? 한량이나 ‘남사친’, ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’, 한국의 작품들 그리고 우진씨 너튜브 채널까지. 홍보 성격을 띤 순서도 충분히 넣었습니다.” “예, PD님.” “그리고 혹시······너튜브 채널에 올라온 곡을 좀 불러주실 수 있으신지.” “무대를 서란 말씀입니까?” “아닙니다. 그저 토크 중간에 한 소절 정도만 불러주셔도 됩니다.” “그 정도는 가능합니다.” 얼굴빛이 단숨에 밝아진 신조 PD는 녹화가 어떻게 진행될지를 읊었다. “아시겠지만, 녹화라 시청자가 보는 방영본처럼 차례로 찍지는 않습니다. 녹화는 긴데 초대된 방청객은 2시간만 있을 예정인 것도 있고, 상황에 맞춰 뒤죽박죽 촬영 후에 편집으로 맞출 생각입니다. 아마 녹화 첫 시작은 방청객 Q&A부터일 겁니다.” “그 그림이 방영 땐 후반부인 겁니까?” “중후반부쯤 되겠죠. 아, 참고로 ‘남사친’ 소개 순서에서 화린씨가 게스트로 확정됐습니다.” 이건 처음 듣는 얘기였다. 최성건을 보니 그도 약간 놀란 눈빛이었다. 급하게 결정된 건가? 싶을 때 그 답을 신조 PD가 읊었다. “오늘 오전에 혹시나 해서 화린씨 측에 연락했는데, 감사하게도 잠깐은 괜찮다고 답변이 왔어요.” 자세한 건 나중에 물어봐도 되겠지. 우진이 속으로 적당히 답을 내린 순간, 건너편 신조 PD가 말을 이었고. “녹화에 초대된 방청객은 우진씨 팬 위주로 선별했고, 대략 200명 정도 됩니다.” 강우진이 순수하게 놀랐다. 물론, 내면으로. ‘일본에 내 팬이 200명이나 있다고??!’ 하지만 빼싹 마른 신조 PD가 반전을 뱉었다. “방청객 신청만 3000여 건이 넘었습니다. 뽑는 데에 진땀 뺐어요, 정말.” 200명은 ‘고작’이었다. 29일. 자잘한 인터뷰나 홍보 스케줄을 돌았던 이틀은 금세 저물었다. 어느새 29일이 밝았다. 29일인 오늘은 일본의 국민 토크쇼 ‘아메토크 show!’의 정식 녹화가 잡혀 있었다. 종일 풀이었다. 장소는 일본 민영 방송국 TBE 내부의 ‘아메토크 show!’ 전용 세트장. 녹화 시작은 오전 10시 무렵. 덕분에 우진은 이른 아침부터 샵에 들려 헤어와 메이크업을 손봤고, 의상으론 위아래 브라운 셋업으로 블레이저와 슬랙스를 차려입었다. 그런 강우진은 시간이 9시 30분을 넘길 쯤. “후웁- 후우-” 세트장 뒤편의 대기실에서 홀로 심호흡 중이었다. 약 30분 전, 신조 PD와 함께 돌았던 세트장이 생각보다 드넓었으니까. 메인 무대 중앙에 놓인 소파 두 개, 뒤쪽에 걸릴 예정인 강우진 관련 여러 포스터들, 무대 주변에 비치된 ‘아메토크 show!’의 로고, 무대 앞쪽 200석 규모의 방청객 자리 등. 조명만 뺀다면 언뜻 대형 영화관 느낌과 유사했다. ‘뭐냐 왜 벌써 녹화 날이냐고. 하- 씨. 개떨린다.’ 생각해보면 강우진은 이런 본격적인 토크쇼가 처음이었다. 애초 라디오나 ‘운동회’를 빼면 한국의 예능도 거의 나가질 않았다. 그런데 대뜸 대형 토크쇼라니. 심지어 한국도 아닌 일본의 국민 예능? ‘들어보니까 이 토크쇼에 헐리웃 스타들도 나왔다고 했어, 한국의 탑배우들도 나오고. 근데 내가?’ 그런 프로의 메인으로 섭외된 강우진. 이건 안 떨리는 게 이상하긴 했다. 덕분에 우진의 양손엔 땀이 차기 시작했다. 낯선 것의 막연함 때문. ‘아메토크 show!’는 ‘연기’가 아니었다. 즉, 아공간의 힘이 불필요했다. 오로지 ‘강우진’의 힘만으로 헤쳐나가야 했다. 그러다 우진은 스스로에게 ‘노빠꾸’ 주문을 퍼트렸다. ‘몰라, 씨. 어떻게든 되겠지. 그냥 하던 대로만 하자, 하던 대로만.’ 피하는 건 불가능하니 최대한 즐기는 수밖에. 뭐 늘 그래왔지 않았는가? 후진은 없다 오직 직진뿐. 마인드 컨트롤을 하니 나름 진정이 되는 강우진이었고. -덜컥! 때마침 대기실 문이 열리며 꽁지머리 최성건이 얼굴을 쭉 내밀었다. “녹화 시작한단다, 가자 우진아.” 우진은 가공된 냉기를 뿜으며 의자서 일어났다. “네, 대표님.” 이어 강우진과 최성건이 복도를 걸을 쯤, 목에 인터컴을 두른 ‘아메토크 show!’ 스탭이 뛰어왔다. 그의 안내를 받으며 걸음을 재촉하는 사이 최성건이 작게 읊조렸다. “방청객 다 찼더라고. 200명 정도라 그러드만 충분히 넘는 것 같더라. 250명은 돼 보여.” “그렇습니까?” “어. 뭐 딱히 긴장은 안 되지? 그래도 여긴 한국이 아니라 일본이니까 한 번 물어는 보는 거야.” 이젠 200명이든 2000명이든 상관없는 우진이었다. 딴딴한 마인드 컨트롤을 한 뒤니까. “한국이나 일본이나 별로 다를 건 없어요.” 피식한 최성건이 우진의 어깨를 두드렸다. “이거 하나는 편하네, 원래 신인들 맡으면 걔네 멘탈 관리가 더 빡세거든. 근데 넌 뭔들 심드렁하잖냐, 하하하.” 예, 대표님. 전쟁은 저 혼자 치르겠습니다. 우진이 각오를 다지자마자 녹화가 있을 스튜디오에 들어섰다. 촬영 세트장 내부는 부산스럽다. 수십 스탭들이나 세팅되는 카메라, 조명, 오디오기기 등등. 이내. -타닷! 몇몇 스탭들이 달려와 강우진에게 마이크를 달았고, 최성건이 무대 위 소파의 남자 MC를 턱짓하며 속삭였다. “저기 저 양반이 카라마츠 소요라고. 일본의 국민 MC쯤 돼. 이름은 들어봤지?” MC 카라마츠 소요는 큐카드를 확인하고 있었다. 약간 통통하니 비버를 닮은 얼굴. 허나 강우진은. “······” 그를 확인할 정신이 없었다. 저 앞에 관객석을 가득 채운 방청객을 보고 있었으니까. 방청객들은 신조 PD의 안내에 따라, 초반 그리고 중후반 등의 인서트 컷을 미리 찍고 있었다. ‘미친, 개웅장하네. 저거 전부 일본 사람인가??’ 그때 방청객 중 앞쪽 몇몇이 마이크 차는 강우진을 발견했다. 덕분에 과한 리액션이 나왔다. “허업! 가, 강우진!” “어디?? 어디요?” “저기요!” 괴성에 가까운 일본어가 금세 방청객 전체로 번졌다. 꺅이나 우왁! 같은 효과음도 과해진다. 곧, 몸을 돌린 신조 PD가 우진에게 우다닥 달려왔고. “우진씨, 녹화니까 너무 긴장하실 필욘 없습니다! 어- 미팅 때 말씀드린 것처럼, 촬영 시작은 방청객들 Q&A부터 시작하겠습니다. 아아, 그리고 화린씨는 녹화 중간에 도착하실 거고요.” “예, 알겠습니다 PD님.” “준비 다 됐나? 어어. 그럼 바로 무대 올라가시면 돼요.” 신속해지는 심박수를 억지로 억누른 우진이 조명으로 밝은 무대에 올랐고, 비버 닮은 MC 소요가 웃으며 강우진에게 손을 내밀었다. “반갑습니다, 카라마츠 소요라고 해요. 하하. 현재 일본에서 가장 핫한 배우를 만나서 영광입니다. 아, 일본어는 잘하신다고?” “예. 안녕하세요, 강우진입니다. 오늘 잘 부탁드립니다.” “허- 진짜······아니 신조 PD님. 이건 일본어를 그냥 잘하는 수준이 아닌데??” 잠시간의 감탄과 적당한 인사말이 오간 뒤, 강우진과 MC 소요는 소파에 나란히 앉았다. 신조 PD는 무대 밖 스탭들 사이로 껴서는 크게 외쳤다. “자- 그럼 녹화 시작합니다! Q&A부터!” 그의 외침이 끝나자 무대 주변에 설치된 카메라에 불이 들어왔다. 녹화가 스타트됐다는 뜻. 그러자 큐카드 든 MC 소요가 천연덕스럽게 멘트를 쳤다. “음, 좋습니다. 그럼 분위기를 좀 바꿔 볼까요? 아까부터 방청객분들의 선명한 시선이 느껴지고 있어서요. 이번엔 여기 계신 방청객분들 Q&A를 진행해보겠습니다!” 녹화스러운 대사였다. 어쨌든 방청객들에게 핸드마이크가 전달됐다. 이때 신조 PD 주변으로 스탭 두 명이 붙었다. 이를 가까이서 지켜보던 최성건이 턱을 쓸었다. ‘통역? 한 명은 혹시 모를 한국어 때문에 불렀다 치면, 나머지 한 명은?’ 일본어라 명확진 않지만, 신조 PD와 그들의 대화에서 ‘통역’ 비슷한 단어를 들은 최성건이었다. 다만, 둘이나 있는 건 이상했다. 어쨌든 방청객의 첫 번째 질문은 중간쯤의 여자였다. 우진을 처음 봐서 표정에 흥분이 가득했다. “아, 안녕하세요! 저는 한량을 보고 팬이 됐어요! 최근 ‘강우진 부캐’ 너튜브 채널을 봤는데요! 계속 같은 주제로 커버 영상을 올려주시는 건가요?” 핸드 마이크를 든 강우진은 차분하게 깔린 일본어를 뱉었다. “네. 꾸준히 올릴 생각입니다. 나아가 KPOP의 커버만이 아닌, JPOP이나 팝송을 한국어로 커버하는 것도 생각하고 있어요.” “악! 그건 언제쯤 올라오나요!” “최선을 다해볼게요.” “감사합니다!” “저야말로.” 스무스한 첫 번째. 다음 차례는 방청객 제일 앞줄의 어려 보이는 남자였다. 그런데. -스윽. 그는 마이크 대신 손을 쓰기 시작했다. 즉, 수어였다. 신조 PD가 의도한 선별인지는 모르겠으나, 수어 쓰는 남자를 보곤 최성건이 천천히 고개를 끄덕였고. ‘아- 저래서 통역이 두 명이었네.’ 무대 위 강우진에 시선을 돌린 최성건이 팔짱을 꼈다. ‘수어라- 우진이가 할 줄 아는 건 한국 수어고. 수어는 나라별로 다르지 아마? 저건 일본 수어고.’ 정답이었다. 수어는 공통 언어가 아니었다. 한국은 물론 일본, 미국 등 전부 달랐다. 각 나라의 언어가 상이 하니 당연했다. 즉, 수어는 나라별 또 다른 언어라 봐도 무방했다. 곧, 최성건이. ‘아쉽네.’ 지금도 열심히 일본 수어를 던지는 어린 남자를 보면서도 입맛을 다셨다. ‘수어가 전세계 공통이었으면, 여기서 우진이가 수어까지 반전으로 딱 보여주는 건데. 그럼 다들 놀라 자빠질 테고.’ 그렇게만 되면 ‘아메토크 show!’에서의 강우진이 더욱 빛날 텐데 말이지. 연예계는 그런 반전이나 충격을 좋아하니까. 우진이 한국의 수어를 잘해선지 최성건의 아쉬움은 더 컸다. 허나 이 건은 그냥 꿀떡 삼켜야 했다. 그래도 뭐 상상하는 게 돈이 드는 건 아니니까. 그렇게 최성건이 입맛을 다실 쯤, 신조 PD와 제작진은 일본 수어의 통역본을 정리해서 프롬프터에 띄웠다. 그리곤 무대 위 MC 소요에게 수신호를 보냈다. 이 순간. “······아? 어?” 수신호를 보내던 신조 PD가 움직임을 딱 멈췄다. 더불어 두 눈이 확장됐다. 그뿐만이 아니었다. “P, PD님 저거-” “···뭐지??” “와- 세상에.” “어떻게 된 거야??” 세트장에 있는 신조 PD의 주변의 스탭들도 마찬가지였다. 200여 명의 방청객도 그랬다. 모두들 무대 위를 보며 얼음처럼 굳었고 입을 작게 벌렸다. 마치, 전혀 예상치 못한 광경을 본다는 듯이. 실제로 그랬다. 신조 PD를 포함한 ‘아메토크 show!’의 전 스탭들이 보는 것은 강우진이었고, 소파에 앉은 우진은 무심했던 처음과는 달리 적당한 표정이 가미되고 있었다. 아니, 정확하게는. “······” 방청객 어린 남자에게 수어로 답하고 있었다. 어린 남자와 눈을 맞춘 우진은 프롬프터를 보지도 않는다. 왜? 어째서? 특이한 것은. ‘······일본 수어?’ 미간을 찌푸린 최성건이 방금 속으로 읊조린 것처럼, 강우진은 한국의 수어가 아닌 일본 수어를 아주 의연하게 보이고 있었다. 그런 강우진은 정작. ‘이 정도쯤 대답하면 되겠지? 응, 적당해.’ 별수롭지 않았다. 뭐랄까, 아무 거리낌이 없달까? 그러다 우진이 굳어버린 어린 남자의 표정을 확인했고, 놀란 토끼 눈의 어린 남자가 다시금 일본 수어를 우진에게 보였다. [“어떻게 일본 수어를 할 줄 아세요?”] 이 역시 편하게 알아듣는 강우진. 엥? 그야 내가 수어를 할 줄- 어? 잠깐만. 이때야 강우진은 깨달았다. ‘내가···왜, 어떻게 일본 수어를 할 줄 알지??’ 자신이 한 게 한국 수어가 아니라는 것을. < 출국 (5) > 끝","completion":"< Departure (5) > One million subscribers. The words spoken by a team leader from Netflix Japan were true. Proving this, Han Ye-jeong attached herself next to Choi Seong-geon with a ponytail. \\"President.\\" She whispered to Choi Seong-geon and showed him her phone. \\"We just reached it.\\" On Han Ye-jeong's phone screen was the main page of the YouTube channel 'Kang Woo-jin's Side Character'. [Channel Name: Kang Woo-jin's Side Character] [Subscribers: 1.01 million] [Videos: 5] Choi Seong-geon's mouth stretched into a grin. \\"Another first achieved.\\" He gave a thumbs-up to Kang Woo-jin on stage. However, Kang Woo-jin, who was currently conducting the event fluently in Japanese, had no idea. \\"Yes. My chemistry with Hwarin was good. The filming set was harmonious from start to finish. If there's something memorable—ah, but it's a bit difficult to mention. It could be a spoiler.\\" The next day, in the morning. After successfully completing the event organized by Netflix Japan the day before, Woo-jin met with the dry Producer Shinjo of 'Ametalk show!' on the morning of the 27th. The meeting took place in a restaurant inside the hotel, with Kang Woo-jin and Choi Seong-geon on one side and Producer Shinjo and the writers on the other. \\"Ha ha, Woo-jin. It's even better to see you in Japan!\\" \\"Hello, Producer.\\" \\"You know, right? Your name is making a lot of noise in Japan right now. Hanryang is doing so well, it's completely different from the early days of research! Communities and SNS are all about you, and since you arrived in Japan yesterday, it's been even crazier.\\" Excitement was sprinkled in the eyes of Producer Shinjo and the writers as they rapidly spoke in Japanese. It was understandable. They had invited Kang Woo-jin just for Hanryang, but he had grown into an unexpected big catch. They had hit the jackpot. \\"And I saw earlier that your YouTube channel already surpassed 1.05 million subscribers? It's really amazing. I've been a producer for a long time, but I've never seen such a rapid rise.\\" Woo-jin, who maintained his composure, was genuinely happy inside. 'I admit, I can't believe this is real. Me—a YouTuber with a million subscribers.' Woo-jin, who briefly recalled yesterday's thrill, imagined a sweet future. 'At this rate, 2 million is a given, and 3 million won't be hard, right? No, this is definitely within reach of 5 million.' Then, Producer Shinjo suddenly brought up work. It was about the recording that would take place in two days. \\"We had to completely change the original plan because everything happened so suddenly. We've added a lot of new parts, and the recording time will be extended.\\" \\"There's no problem.\\" \\"Ha ha, thank you. Well, you can think of the opening and closing as usual, and you're involved in works like Hanryang, 'Boyfriend Material,' 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger,' Korean works, and even your YouTube channel. We've included plenty of promotional segments.\\" \\"Yes, Producer.\\" \\"And, by any chance... could you sing one of the songs you uploaded on your YouTube channel?\\" \\"Do you mean perform on stage?\\" \\"No, just singing a verse or so during the talk would be fine.\\" \\"I can do that much.\\" Producer Shinjo's face brightened instantly as he explained how the recording would proceed. \\"As you know, we don't shoot in order as the viewers see on the broadcast. The recording is long, but the invited audience will only be there for 2 hours, and we plan to shoot haphazardly according to the situation and then edit it together. The first start of the recording will probably be the audience Q&A.\\" \\"Will that part be towards the end of the broadcast?\\" \\"It will be around the middle to the latter half. Oh, and by the way, Hwarin has been confirmed as a guest for the 'Boyfriend Material' segment.\\" This was news to Woo-jin. Choi Seong-geon also seemed a bit surprised. Was it a hasty decision? When he thought that, Producer Shinjo provided the answer. \\"This morning, I contacted Hwarin's side just in case, and thankfully, they said it was okay for a short while.\\" Woo-jin could ask for more details later. Just as he came to a reasonable conclusion, Producer Shinjo continued speaking. \\"The invited audience for the recording has been selected mainly from your fans, about 200 people.\\" Kang Woo-jin was genuinely surprised, internally. 'There are 200 of my fans in Japan??!' But the dry Producer Shinjo dropped a twist. \\"There were over 3,000 applications for the audience. It was really tough to select them.\\" 200 was just 'merely.' On the 29th. The two days filled with minor interviews and promotional schedules quickly passed. Before long, it was the 29th. Today, the official recording of Japan's national talk show 'Ametalk show!' was scheduled. It was a full day. The location was the 'Ametalk show!' dedicated set inside the private Japanese broadcasting station TBE. The recording started around 10 a.m. As a result, Woo-jin had to visit the salon early in the morning to get his hair and makeup done, and he dressed in a brown blazer and slacks set. At that time, around 9:30 a.m. \\"Huff—hoo—\\" Woo-jin was alone in the waiting room behind the set, taking deep breaths. About 30 minutes earlier, the set he had toured with Producer Shinjo was surprisingly spacious. There were two sofas in the center of the main stage, various posters related to Kang Woo-jin to be hung in the back, the 'Ametalk show!' logo around the stage, and about 200 seats for the audience in front. Without the lights, it almost felt like a large movie theater. 'Why is it already the day of recording? Ah, damn. I'm so nervous.' Thinking about it, this was Kang Woo-jin's first time on a formal talk show. Excluding radio and 'Sports Day,' he had hardly appeared on Korean variety shows. And now he was suddenly on a major talk show. Moreover, not even a Korean show but Japan's national variety show? 'I heard this talk show has had Hollywood stars and top Korean actors. But me?' Kang Woo-jin, who had been invited as the main guest on such a show, would naturally be nervous. As a result, his hands began to sweat. It was the vague fear of the unknown. 'Ametalk show!' was not 'acting.' In other words, the power of the pocket dimension was unnecessary. He had to navigate through it with only the power of 'Kang Woo-jin.' Then, Woo-jin cast a 'no backing down' spell on himself. 'Forget it, damn it. It'll work out somehow. Just do as I always do, just as I always do.' Since avoiding it was impossible, he had to enjoy it as much as possible. Hadn't it always been like that? There was no retreat, only moving forward. As Woo-jin controlled his mind, he felt somewhat calmed. -Thunk! Just then, the door to the waiting room opened, and Choi Seong-geon with a ponytail poked his head in. \\"The recording is starting, let's go, Woo-jin.\\" Woo-jin stood up from his chair, exuding an artificial chill. \\"Yes, President.\\" As Kang Woo-jin and Choi Seong-geon walked down the corridor, a staff member from 'Ametalk show!' with an intercom around his neck rushed over. Following his guidance, Choi Seong-geon whispered as they hurried along. \\"The audience is all here. They said about 200, but it looked like more. Maybe around 250.\\" \\"Is that so?\\" \\"Yeah. But you're not nervous, right? Even though this is Japan, not Korea, I thought I'd ask.\\" Woo-jin was unfazed, whether it was 200 or 2,000 people, after his solid mind control. \\"It doesn't make much difference whether it's Korea or Japan.\\" Choi Seong-geon chuckled and patted Woo-jin's shoulder. \\"That's one less thing to worry about. Usually, managing the mentality of rookies is tougher. But you're always so nonchalant, ha ha ha.\\" Yes, President. I will fight this battle alone. As Woo-jin steeled himself, they entered the studio where the recording would take place. The set was bustling. Dozens of staff, cameras, lights, audio equipment, and more were being set up. Soon. -Tadat! A few staff members rushed over to attach a microphone to Kang Woo-jin, and Choi Seong-geon gestured towards the male MC on the stage and whispered. \\"That guy over there is Karamatsu Soyo. He's like Japan's national MC. Have you heard of him?\\" MC Karamatsu Soyo was checking his cue cards. He had a slightly chubby face that resembled a beaver. However, Kang Woo-jin. \\"......\\" He had no mind to check him out as he was looking at the audience filling the seats. The audience, following Producer Shinjo's instructions, were pre-filming insert cuts for the beginning and middle-to-latter parts of the show. 'Crazy, it's so grand. Are all those people Japanese??' Then, a few audience members in the front spotted Woo-jin getting his microphone attached. Their reactions were exaggerated. \\"Huh! Ka, Kang Woo-jin!\\" \\"Where?? Where?\\" \\"Over there!\\" Their almost shrieking Japanese quickly spread throughout the audience. Exaggerated sound effects like gasps and shouts intensified. Soon, Producer Shinjo, who had turned around, rushed over to Woo-jin. \\"Woo-jin, there's no need to be too nervous since it's a recording! Uh—like I mentioned during the meeting, we'll start the shooting with the audience Q&A. Ah, and Hwarin will arrive in the middle of the recording.\\" \\"Yes, I understand, Producer.\\" \\"Is everything ready? Oh, then you can go up on stage now.\\" Woo-jin, who forcibly suppressed his accelerating heartbeat, stepped onto the brightly lit stage, and the beaver-like MC Soyo smiled and extended his hand to Woo-jin. \\"Nice to meet you, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Ha ha. It's an honor to meet the hottest actor in Japan right now. Oh, you speak Japanese well?\\" \\"Yes. Hello, I'm Kang Woo-jin. Please take care of me today.\\" \\"Wow... really... I mean, Producer Shinjo. This isn't just good Japanese, is it??\\" After a brief moment of admiration and polite greetings, Kang Woo-jin and MC Soyo sat side by side on the sofa. Producer Shinjo squeezed in among the staff outside the stage and shouted loudly. \\"Alright—let's start the recording! Starting with the Q&A!\\" As his shout ended, the lights on the cameras around the stage lit up. It signaled the start of the recording. Then, MC Soyo, holding the cue cards, naturally delivered his lines. \\"Alright, let's change the atmosphere a bit, shall we? I've been feeling the clear gaze of the audience since earlier. This time, we'll conduct a Q&A with the audience members here!\\" It was a line fitting for a recording. Anyway, handheld microphones were passed to the audience. At this time, two staff members approached Producer Shinjo. Choi Seong-geon, watching closely, stroked his chin. 'Interpreters? One is probably for any unexpected Korean, but what about the other?' Although it wasn't clear in Japanese, Choi Seong-geon heard something like 'interpreter' in the conversation between Producer Shinjo and the staff. However, having two seemed odd. Anyway, the first question from the audience came from a woman in the middle. She was excited to see Woo-jin for the first time. \\"Ah, hello! I became a fan after watching Hanryang! I recently saw your 'Kang Woo-jin's Side Character' YouTube channel! Will you continue to upload cover videos on the same theme?\\" Woo-jin, holding the handheld microphone, spoke in calm Japanese. \\"Yes. I plan to continue uploading consistently. Furthermore, not only KPOP covers, but I'm also considering covering JPOP and pop songs in Korean.\\" \\"Ah! When will those be uploaded?\\" \\"I'll do my best.\\" \\"Thank you!\\" \\"You're welcome.\\" The first question went smoothly. The next turn was for a young-looking man in the front row of the audience. But. -Swish. Instead of a microphone, he began to use his hands. In other words, it was sign language. Whether Producer Shinjo had intentionally selected him or not, Choi Seong-geon slowly nodded his head. 'Ah, so that's why there were two interpreters.' On stage, Kang Woo-jin looked at Choi Seong-geon, who had crossed his arms. 'Sign language—Woo-jin knows Korean sign language. Sign language is different in each country, right? That's Japanese sign language.' He was correct. Sign language was not a universal language. It varied from country to country, including Korea, Japan, and the United States. Since each country's language was different, it was natural. In other words, sign language could be considered a different language in each country. Soon, Choi Seong-geon. 'That's a shame.' Even as he watched the young man earnestly using Japanese sign language, he licked his lips. 'If sign language was universal, Woo-jin could have shown a reversal with sign language right here. Everyone would have been shocked.' If only that were the case, Kang Woo-jin would have shone even more on 'Ametalk show!' The entertainment industry loved such reversals and shocks. Since Woo-jin was good at Korean sign language, Choi Seong-geon's disappointment was even greater. However, he had to swallow this one. Still, imagining didn't cost money. As Choi Seong-geon licked his lips, Producer Shinjo and the production team organized the translation of the Japanese sign language and displayed it on the prompter. Then they signaled to MC Soyo on stage. At that moment. \\"......Ah? Huh?\\" Producer Shinjo, who was sending signals, suddenly stopped moving. His eyes widened. And it wasn't just him. \\"P, Producer, that—\\" \\"...What??\\" \\"Wow—unbelievable.\\" \\"What's going on??\\" The staff around Producer Shinjo on the set were the same. The 200 or so audience members were also frozen, their mouths slightly agape, as if they were witnessing something completely unexpected. And they were. What Producer Shinjo and the entire 'Ametalk show!' staff saw was Kang Woo-jin, who, unlike his initial indifference, now had an appropriate expression on his face. No, more precisely. \\"......\\" He was responding to the young audience member with sign language. Woo-jin, who made eye contact with the young man, wasn't even looking at the prompter. Why? How? What was peculiar was. '......Japanese sign language?' Choi Seong-geon furrowed his brow, and just as he had thought to himself, Kang Woo-jin was showing Japanese sign language very composedly. Meanwhile, Kang Woo-jin himself. 'This should be a good enough response, right? Yeah, that's appropriate.' He was nonchalant. How to put it, he had no hesitation? Then, Woo-jin noticed the frozen expression of the young man and saw the startled rabbit-eyed young man showing him Japanese sign language again. [\\"How do you know Japanese sign language?\\"] Woo-jin understood it comfortably. Huh? Because I know sign language—wait a minute. It was only then that Woo-jin realized. 'Why... how do I know Japanese sign language?' That what he had used was not Korean sign language. < Departure (5) > The end"},{"prompt":"190 * * * 현재 스코어는 4 대 2. 2골을 먼저 허용한 이후에 4골을 연달아 넣은 한국이 경기를 주도하고 있었다. 분위기 역시 완전히 한국 쪽으로 넘어왔다. 한국의 수비는 여전히 불안했지만, 워낙 강력하게 밀어붙이다 보니 알제리는 쉽게 역습 기회를 만들지 못했다. ― 알제리의 선수들이 굉장히 힘들어하네요! 이 선수들도 이렇게 밀리기만 해서는 안 된다는 걸 누구보다도 잘 알고 있을 겁니다. 하지만 알면서도 공격을 하지 못하고 있습니다! ― 공격을 나가기가 힘들죠. 지금 전방에 있는 우리 선수들의 움직임이 너무 날카롭거든요? 특히 신재욱 선수는 매 순간 위협적인 움직임을 보여주고 있습니다! 해설들의 말처럼 신재욱은 알제리의 수비진이 위축되고 있는 가장 큰 이유였다. ― 신재욱! 슈우우우웃! 아! 골키퍼가 간신히 쳐냈습니다! 와…… 정말 무서운데요? 신재욱 선수, 패스를 주고받다가 갑자기 슈팅을 때려버리네요! 수비수가 예상할 수 없는 타이밍에 나온 슈팅이었죠? 게다가 그 슈팅이 굉장히 강력했습니다! ― 알제리 선수들 지금 깜짝 놀랐죠! 이러니까 역습을 할 수가 없는 겁니다! 신재욱 선수가 언제 슈팅을 할지 모르거든요! 골키퍼가 쳐낸 공이 라인 밖으로 나갔기 때문에, 한국의 코너킥이 선언됐다. 알제리로선 더욱 답답해지는 상황이었다. 시간도 없는데 오히려 공격 기회를 내줬으니까. 게다가 신재욱의 헤더는 너무나도 위협적이었으니까. 퍼엉! 기석용이 공을 높게 올렸다. 공은 많이 휘어지지 않은 채 알제리의 페널티박스 안으로 날아갔다. 신재욱에겐 수비수 한 명이 바짝 달라붙어 있었다. 그러나 그런 상황에서도 신재욱은 날아오는 공을 머리에 맞추는 데 성공했다. 투웅! 그러나 제대로 걸린 헤딩은 아니었다. 신재욱은 골대 안으로 공을 보낼 생각이었지만, 실제로는 골대를 벗어났다. ― 아깝습니다! 신재욱 선수의 헤더가 골대를 살짝 벗어나네요! 하지만 신재욱 선수의 공중볼 경합 능력을 확실하게 보여준 장면 같네요! 코너킥으로 추가 골을 만들진 못했지만, 좋은 기회는 금방 찾아왔다. ― 손훈민! 치고 나갑니다! 빠릅니다! 공격을 나서려던 알제리의 선수 하나가 공을 빼앗겼고, 그 공을 손훈민이 잡은 채 전방을 향해 달리기 시작했다. 유럽에서도 통할 정도로 빠른 스피드를 지닌 손훈민은 알제리의 수비수 하나를 스피드만으로 제쳐냈다. ― 알제리가 손훈민의 질주를 막지 못합니다! 공을 달고 뛰는데도 굉장히 빠르네요! 그런 상황에서. 신재욱과 이택현도 전방을 향해 전속력으로 뛰었다. 이택현은 손훈민보다도 더 빠른 스피드로 전진했고. 이제는 제법 준수한 스피드를 낼 수 있게 된 신재욱도 전진을 방해하는 알제리의 수비수를 따돌리며 뛰어나갔다. 그때였다. 손훈민이 슈팅할 것처럼 방향을 튼 뒤, 기습적으로 공을 옆으로 툭― 밀어냈다. 그와 가장 가까운 곳에 있던 이택현에게 보낸 패스였다. “나이스 패스!” 그 순간 알제리 수비수들의 시선이 이택현에게 쏠렸다. 이들 모두 어떻게든 이택현의 슈팅을 막으려고 했다. 필사적으로 몸을 던지고, 발을 뻗었다. 그런데 이때. 이택현의 입가에 진한 미소가 떠올랐다. “슈팅 안 할 건데?” 그 말과 함께 이택현은 굴러오는 공을 그대로 흘려버렸다. 수비수들의 시선을 잔뜩 끌어낸 뒤, 같은 라인에 서 있던 신재욱에게 공을 넘겨주는 플레이였다. 뛰어난 침착성과 넓은 시야, 타고난 센스가 있어야만 할 수 있는 플레이였고, 이택현은 그걸 완벽하게 해냈다. ‘이러면 너무 고맙지.’ 신재욱 역시 입가에 미소를 지은 채, 굴러오는 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. 퍼엉! 굴러오는 공을 잘 때리면 스핀이 강하게 먹게 된다. 즉, 잘 휘어진 슈팅이 나오게 된다. 지금 신재욱이 한 슈팅이 그랬다. 크게 휘어진 공은 골키퍼의 손이 닿지 않는 구석으로 파고들었다. 철썩! 알제리의 골망이 흔들렸다. ― 이야……! 신재욱 선수의 골입니다! 이택현 선수가 절묘하게 흘려준 공을 신재욱 선수가 그대로 슈팅하며 골을 만들어냈습니다! ― 이제 신재욱 선수에겐 원샷원킬이라는 별명이 생길 것 같은데요? ― 하하! 원샷원킬보단 원슛원골이 더 괜찮지 않나요? ― 하하하하! 그나저나 신재욱 선수는 이번 월드컵이 끝나면 몸값이 더 높아지겠네요! ― 맞습니다! 전 세계가 지켜보는 무대에서 이렇게나 완벽한 경기력을 보여주고 있으니까요! 골이 인정되며 5 대 2가 된 지금. 알제리 선수들은 허탈한 표정으로 고개를 숙였다. 이제 이들은 완전히 마음이 꺾였고, 모든 희망을 잃어버렸다. 반면 한국 대표팀은 축제 분위기였다. “이요오오오오! 재욱아! 또 너냐? 너 벌써 4골이나 넣은 거 알지?” “16강 간다! 하하하! 진짜 16강에 가게 될 줄이야!” “재욱아! 지금 네가 넣을 골로 5 대 2가 됐어! 대박이다 진짜!” “내가 흘려준 거 어땠어? 쩔었지?” 경기를 지켜보던 한국 축구팬들은 놀랍다는 반응을 드러냈다. └ 고오오오오오올!!!!!!! 신재욱은 리얼 미쳤다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 얜 걍 수준이 다르다니까ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 근데 방금 골은 손훈민이랑 이택현이 다 만들어준 거긴 해. └ 신재욱이 전방으로 달리는 타이밍이랑 위치선정 다 완벽해서 넣을 수 있던 거야. 축알못들은 이걸 주워 먹었다고 말할 테지만, 축구 좀 본 사람이라면 신재욱의 오프더볼 움직임이 얼마나 미쳤는지 알아봤을걸? └ 다른 건 모르겠지만, 신재욱의 슈팅만큼은 그냥 백발백중이네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 무서울 정도로 정확해. └ 우리 너무 잘하는데? 이 정도면 유럽의 강한 팀들이랑 붙어도 할만하지 않을까? └ 유럽엔 워낙 강한 팀들이 많아서……근데 이 정도 경기력이면 혹시 모르긴 하겠다. └ 솔직히 기대되는데? 사실상 16강도 확정이니까 16강에서 대진운만 좋으면 8강도 꿈은 아닌 것 같아. └ 16강 상대 어디일까? 벌써 궁금하네. └ 이 정도면 진짜 8강 갈 듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이들이 생각했던 것보다 한국 대표팀의 경기력은 뛰어났기에, 기대감이 생겼다. 한국이 이번 2014 월드컵에서 높은 곳까지 올라갈 수도 있겠다는 기대감이. 그러나 이들은 잊고 있었다. H조에서의 경기는 아직 한 경기가 더 남았다는 걸. * * * 삐이이익! 알제리와의 경기가 종료됐다. 알제리의 선수들과 이들을 응원하던 팬들은 큰 충격을 받고 경기장을 빠져나갔다. 같은 시각, 한국의 뉴스와 각종 포털사이트엔 한국 대표팀에 관련된 소식들이 쏟아지듯 올라왔다. 「한국, 알제리를 꺾으며 월드컵 16강 진출 확정!」 「알제리와의 경기에서 5 대 2 승리! 러시아전에 이어서 강력한 화력 보여준 한국! 강팀들과의 경기에선 어떤 모습 보여줄까?」 「16강 진출 확정된 한국, 8강에 오를 수 있을까?」 「축구천재 신재욱, 알제리전에서도 4골 기록하며 세계를 놀라게 해!」 알제리를 이겼고, 그로 인해서 16강행이 확정된 상황. 당연하게도 한국 대표팀의 분위기는 전보다 더 좋아졌다. 이런 분위기는 다음 날도 지속됐다. 모두가 즐거워하는 시간. 그러나 신재욱은 이런 분위기를 경계했다. ‘모두 훈련에 집중하지 못하고 있어.’ 선수들은 16강에 오르게 됐다는 사실에 너무 들뜬 나머지 가장 중요한 훈련에 집중하지 못하고 있었다. 러시아전과 알제리전을 준비할 때와 비교했을 때, 지금은 훈련을 대충 한다고 해도 과언이 아니었다. ‘심지어 감독과 코치들도 다를 게 없어. 이건 좋지 않은데…….’ 대표팀의 감독 홍정태는 선수들과 함께 웃고 떠들고 있었다. 심지어 훈련 중이었는데도. ‘다음 경기에선 이길 생각이 없는 건가?’ H조에서 2승을 거두며 16강행을 확정했지만, 한국의 다음 일정은 여전히 H조에 속한 팀과의 경기였다. 벨기에. H조에서 가장 강하다고 평가받고, 최소한 8강에는 오를만한 전력이라고 평가받는 팀. 한국의 전력으로는 이기는 게 너무나도 어려운 팀이었다. 그래서일까? 굳이 입 밖으로 말은 꺼내지 않았지만, 홍정태 감독과 한국 대표팀 선수들은 벨기에전을 당연히 버리는 경기라고 생각하고 있었다. 어차피 이길 수 없고 져도 16강행에 방해받지 않으니, 굳이 힘을 빼지 않을 경기로 인식하고 있었다. 그리고 신재욱은 그런 감독과 동료들을 이해하지 못했다. ‘왜 더 앞을 내다보지 못하는 걸까?’ 신재욱은 다르게 생각했다. 더 높은 곳에 올라가고 싶으면 벨기에와의 경기에서도 이겨야 한다고 생각했다. ‘기세가 얼마나 중요한지 모르는 건가.’ 그래서 신재욱은 훈련이 끝난 뒤, 감독을 찾아갔다. “감독님, 벨기에전은 버릴 거예요?” 직설적인 질문이었다. 그 질문을 받은 홍정태 감독의 얼굴이 붉게 달아올랐다. “뭐? 지금 뭔 소리를 하는 거야? 재욱아, 너 갑자기 찾아오더니 그게 무슨 말이야?” “말 그대로입니다. 벨기에전은 대충 져버리고 16강전부터 제대로 준비할 생각이시냐고요.” “너…… 말을 왜 그렇게 해? 대충 져버리는 게 어딨어?” “지금 팀 분위기 보니까 그렇게 느껴져서요. 경기를 앞두고 이렇게 훈련하는 건 프로가 된 이후로는 본 적이 없거든요. 게다가 상대는 벨기에인데 말이죠.” “후우……! 재욱아.” “예.” 한숨을 내쉰 홍정태 감독은 이내 쓴웃음을 지으며 입을 열었다. “쉽게 갈 수 있을 땐 쉽게 가는 게 좋잖아? 16강에서 선발로 뛸 선수들은 쉬게 해주면서 체력도 회복하고, 지금까지 경기에 나가지 못했던 선수들은 월드컵 경험도 시켜주고 얼마나 좋아?” “그 방법이 정말 좋다고 생각하세요?” “…뭐? 그럼 안 좋다는 거야?” “월드컵에서 높게 올라가기엔 좋은 방법이 아닌 것 같아요.” “어째서지?” “기세요.” “…기세… 라고?” “감독님도 아실 거예요. 팀이 패배를 겪으면 어쩔 수 없이 기세가 떨어지게 돼요. 그래서 몇몇 팀들은 중요한 대회를 앞두면 약한 팀을 골라서 훈련하죠. 이기는 것에 익숙해지고, 자신감을 높이기 위해서요. 그런데 지금 감독님은 기껏 올라간 한국 대표팀의 기세를 떨어뜨리려고 하고 있어요. 그래서 제가 찾아온 겁니다.” “내가…… 팀의 기세를 떨어뜨리려고 하고 있다고?” “예. 벨기에전에서 패배하면, 100% 우리의 기세는 떨어질 거예요.” “하지만 너도 알잖아? 우리 전력으론 벨기에를 이기기 힘들다는 거! 이건 너도 공감하잖아?” 어쩔 수 없다는 표정으로 소리치는 홍정태 감독의 모습. 그 모습을 물끄러미 바라보며, 신재욱은 고개를 저었다. “아뇨, 전 이길 수 있다고 생각해요.” “뭐……?” “이길 수 있다고요. 상대가 벨기에든 어디든.” “……!” 홍정태 감독의 눈이 커졌다. 그는 한참을 아무 말도 하지 못했다. 그리고 신재욱은 홍정태 감독을 향해 마지막 말을 남기며 방을 떠났다. “감독님이 어디까지 바라보고 계시는지는 모르겠지만, 8강이 아니라, 4강, 그보다 더 높은 곳을 바라보려면 패배는 생각하지 않아야 해요. 절대로.”","completion":"190 * * * The current score is 4 to 2. Korea was leading the game after scoring 4 consecutive goals following the initial 2 goals conceded to Algeria. The momentum had completely shifted to Korea's side. Although Korea's defense was still shaky, their relentless pressure made it difficult for Algeria to create counterattack opportunities. \\"The Algerian players are having a tough time! They know better than anyone that they can't just be pushed back like this. But even though they know, they can't attack!\\" \\"It's hard to go on the offensive. Our forwards' movements are too sharp, right? Especially Shin Jae-wook, he's showing threatening movements every moment!\\" As the commentators said, Shin Jae-wook was the biggest reason why the Algerian defense was feeling intimidated. \\"Shin Jae-wook! Shoooot! Ah! The goalkeeper barely manages to deflect it! Wow... that's really scary, isn't it? Shin Jae-wook suddenly shoots after passing! It was a shot that came at an unpredictable timing for the defenders, right? And it was a very powerful shot!\\" \\"The Algerian players are shocked now! This is why they can't counterattack! They don't know when Shin Jae-wook will shoot!\\" Since the goalkeeper deflected the ball out of bounds, a corner kick was awarded to Korea. It was an even more frustrating situation for Algeria. There was not much time left, and they had just given away an opportunity to attack. Moreover, Shin Jae-wook's headers were too threatening. Boom! Ki Seok-yong sent the ball high into the air. The ball flew into Algeria's penalty box without much curve. Shin Jae-wook had a defender closely marking him. However, even in such a situation, Shin Jae-wook managed to connect with the ball using his head. Thump! But it wasn't a well-placed header. Shin Jae-wook intended to send the ball into the goal, but it actually went wide of the goalpost. \\"What a pity! Shin Jae-wook's header just misses the goal! But it was a moment that definitely showcased Shin Jae-wook's aerial duel abilities!\\" Although they didn't score from the corner kick, another good opportunity soon arose. \\"Son Hoon-min! He breaks away! He's fast!\\" An Algerian player attempting to attack lost the ball, and Son Hoon-min, who seized it, started sprinting forward. With speed that could compete in Europe, Son Hoon-min outpaced one of the Algerian defenders with sheer speed. \\"Algeria can't stop Son Hoon-min's sprint! He's incredibly fast even with the ball!\\" In that situation. Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun also sprinted forward at full speed. Lee Taek-hyun advanced even faster than Son Hoon-min. And Shin Jae-wook, who had become quite fast, managed to dodge the Algerian defenders trying to block him and broke away. Then, Son Hoon-min, pretending to shoot, suddenly pushed the ball sideways with a surprise move. It was a pass to Lee Taek-hyun, who was closest to him. \\"Nice pass!\\" At that moment, the Algerian defenders' attention was drawn to Lee Taek-hyun. They all tried desperately to block Lee Taek-hyun's shot, throwing their bodies and stretching their legs. But then. Lee Taek-hyun's lips curled into a broad smile. \\"Not going to shoot?\\" With those words, Lee Taek-hyun let the rolling ball pass by him. After drawing the defenders' attention, he played the ball to Shin Jae-wook, who was in the same line. It was a play that required outstanding composure, a broad vision, and innate sense, and Lee Taek-hyun executed it perfectly. 'That's too kind of you.' Shin Jae-wook also smiled as he swung his leg at the rolling ball. Boom! When you hit a rolling ball well, it spins strongly. Meaning, a well-curved shot is produced. That's what Shin Jae-wook's shot was like. The ball, curving greatly, burrowed into a corner where the goalkeeper couldn't reach. Thwack! The Algerian net shook. \\"Wow...! It's a goal by Shin Jae-wook! Lee Taek-hyun exquisitely let the ball roll, and Shin Jae-wook turned it into a goal with a direct shot!\\" \\"It looks like Shin Jae-wook might earn the nickname 'One Shot, One Kill' after this, doesn't it?\\" \\"Ha ha! Wouldn't 'One Shot, One Goal' be better?\\" \\"Ha ha ha ha! Anyway, Shin Jae-wook's value will surely rise after this World Cup!\\" \\"That's right! He's showing such perfect performance on a stage watched by the whole world!\\" Now with the score at 5 to 2. The Algerian players hung their heads in despair. They had completely lost heart and all hope. On the other hand, the Korean national team was in a festive mood. \\"Yeeessss! Jae-wook! You again? You know you've already scored 4 goals?\\" \\"We're going to the round of 16! Ha ha ha! Who would have thought we'd really make it to the round of 16!\\" \\"Jae-wook! With your goal, it's now 5 to 2! This is amazing!\\" \\"How was the pass I gave you? It was killer, right?\\" Korean soccer fans watching the game expressed their amazement. └ Goooooal!!!!!!! Shin Jae-wook is really insaneㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He's just on another levelㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ But the last goal was really made by Son Hoon-min and Lee Taek-hyun. └ Shin Jae-wook's timing and positioning for the forward run were perfect, allowing him to score. Soccer noobs might say he just picked up the scraps, but anyone who knows a bit about soccer would recognize how insane Shin Jae-wook's off-the-ball movement was, right? └ I don't know about other things, but Shin Jae-wook's shooting is just spot-onㅋㅋㅋㅋ It's terrifyingly accurate. └ Aren't we playing too well? At this rate, couldn't we even take on the strong European teams? └ Europe has a lot of strong teams... But with this level of performance, who knows? └ I'm honestly excited? Since we're practically confirmed for the round of 16, if we get lucky with the draw, the quarterfinals don't seem like a dream. └ Who will we face in the round of 16? I'm already curious. └ At this rate, we're really going to the quarterfinalsㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ The Korean national team's performance exceeded their expectations, and they felt hopeful. There was hope that Korea could climb high in the 2014 World Cup. But they had forgotten something. There was still one more game left in Group H. * * * The whistle blew! The game against Algeria was over. The Algerian players and their fans, who had been cheering for them, left the stadium in shock. At the same time, news and various portal sites in Korea were flooded with news about the Korean national team. \\"Korea defeats Algeria and confirms advancement to the World Cup round of 16!\\" \\"Victory of 5 to 2 against Algeria! Korea shows strong firepower following the game against Russia! What will they show against strong teams?\\" \\"Korea confirmed for the round of 16, can they make it to the quarterfinals?\\" \\"Soccer prodigy Shin Jae-wook scores 4 goals against Algeria, astonishing the world!\\" Having defeated Algeria and thus confirming their place in the round of 16, the mood of the Korean national team naturally improved. This atmosphere continued into the next day. Everyone was having a good time. However, Shin Jae-wook was wary of this mood. 'Everyone is too distracted to focus on training.' The players were too excited about making it to the round of 16, and as a result, they were not focusing on the most important training. Compared to when they were preparing for the games against Russia and Algeria, the current training was almost negligent. 'Even the coach and the staff are no different. This isn't good...' Coach Hong Jeong-tae of the national team was laughing and chatting with the players. Even during training. 'Do they not intend to win the next game?' Although they had secured a spot in the round of 16 with two wins in Group H, Korea's next schedule was still a game against a team in Group H. Belgium. Rated as the strongest team in Group H and considered to have the power to at least make it to the quarterfinals. It was a team that was too difficult for Korea to beat. Perhaps that's why? Although they didn't say it out loud, Coach Hong Jeong-tae and the Korean national team players considered the game against Belgium to be a given loss. Since they couldn't win and losing wouldn't hinder their advancement to the round of 16, they saw it as a game where they didn't need to exert themselves. And Shin Jae-wook couldn't understand his coach and teammates. 'Why can't they look further ahead?' Shin Jae-wook thought differently. If they wanted to climb higher, they needed to win even against Belgium. 'Momentum is so important.' That's why, after training, Shin Jae-wook went to see the coach. \\"Coach, are we giving up on the Belgium game?\\" It was a direct question. Faced with that question, Coach Hong Jeong-tae's face turned red. \\"What? What are you talking about? Jae-wook, you suddenly come here and say that?\\" \\"I mean exactly what I said. Are you planning to casually lose the Belgium game and properly prepare for the round of 16?\\" \\"You... why do you talk like that? Who just casually loses a game?\\" \\"That's how it feels looking at the team's current atmosphere. I've never seen training like this since becoming a pro. Especially when the opponent is Belgium.\\" \\"Hoo...! Jae-wook.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Coach Hong Jeong-tae sighed and then smiled bitterly as he spoke. \\"Isn't it better to take the easy route when you can? Let the players who will start in the round of 16 rest and recover their stamina, and give the players who haven't played in the games a World Cup experience. Isn't that great?\\" \\"Do you really think that's a good approach?\\" \\"...What? So you think it's not good?\\" \\"It doesn't seem like a good approach for climbing higher in the World Cup.\\" \\"Why not?\\" \\"Momentum.\\" \\"...Momentum?\\" \\"You know, Coach. When a team experiences defeat, their momentum inevitably drops. That's why some teams choose weaker opponents for practice matches before important tournaments. To get used to winning and to boost confidence. But now, Coach, you're trying to bring down the momentum of the Korean national team that has climbed so high. That's why I came to see you.\\" \\"I'm... trying to bring down the team's momentum?\\" \\"Yes. If we lose the Belgium game, our momentum will definitely drop 100%.\\" \\"But you know it too, right? With our power, it's difficult to beat Belgium! You agree with that, don't you?\\" Coach Hong Jeong-tae shouted with a resigned expression. Looking at him, Shin Jae-wook shook his head. \\"No, I think we can win.\\" \\"What...?\\" \\"We can win. No matter if the opponent is Belgium or anyone else.\\" \\"......!\\" Coach Hong Jeong-tae's eyes widened. He was speechless for a long time. And Shin Jae-wook left the room after leaving one last message to Coach Hong Jeong-tae. \\"I don't know how far you're looking, Coach, but if you want to aim higher than the quarterfinals, the semifinals, or even higher, you can't think about defeat. Never.\\""},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have the ability to continue a story in the exact style or with the same plot details as the original author.

Here's a fictional continuation of the story: --- As the Korean team prepared for their match against Belgium, the atmosphere in the camp was a mix of excitement and tension. The players were aware of the challenge ahead, but Shin Jae-wook's words had ignited a spark within them. Coach Hong Jeong-tae, reflecting on Jae-wook's passionate plea, decided to hold a team meeting. \\"Listen up, everyone,\\" Coach Hong began, his voice carrying a newfound determination. \\"We've come this far not just to participate, but to compete. To show the world what Korean football is capable of. Jae-wook is right—we can't afford to lose our momentum now.\\" The players nodded, feeling the weight of their coach's words. They knew the match against Belgium would be tough, but they also knew that they had the talent and the spirit to face any challenge. The day of the match arrived, and the stadium was filled with the roars of excited fans. The Korean team stepped onto the pitch with a clear game plan and a unified resolve to give their best performance. The whistle blew, and the game began with Belgium taking early control. However, Korea's defense, led by the indomitable Shin Jae-wook, held firm. As the match progressed, Korea started to find their rhythm, and the Belgian defense was tested by the swift counterattacks orchestrated by Son Hoon-min and Lee Taek-hyun. In the 57th minute, a breakthrough came. Shin Jae-wook, with his exceptional vision, spotted a gap in the Belgian defense and delivered a precise through ball to Son Hoon-min, who didn't hesitate to drive the ball into the back of the net. The Korean fans erupted in cheers as the scoreboard changed to 1-0. Belgium, now trailing, increased their pressure, but Korea's defense remained solid. The Korean team fought for every ball, and their tenacity paid off. In the dying minutes of the match, a well-executed set-piece saw Shin Jae-wook rise above the defenders to head in Korea's second goal. The final whistle confirmed the unthinkable—Korea had defeated Belgium 2-0. The victory sent shockwaves through the tournament and proved that Korea was a force to be reckoned with. The players embraced each other, their joy evident for all to see. As the Korean team celebrated their historic win, Shin Jae-wook's earlier words echoed in their minds. They had not only secured their place in the round of 16 but had also shown that with belief and hard work, they could aspire to reach even greater heights. The world took notice of Korea's triumph, and the team's journey in the 2014 World Cup was far from over. With their newfound confidence and unity, they were ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, one match at a time. --- Please note that this continuation is a work of fiction and not an actual event or part of an existing story."},{"prompt":"192 * * * 다니엘 판바위턴. 197cm라는 괴물 같은 피지컬과 뛰어난 수비 능력으로 독일 최강의 팀인 바이에른 뮌헨에서 오랜 시간 주전 수비수로 활약했던 선수. 지금은 많은 나이로 인해서 신체능력이 떨어지며 은퇴를 생각해야 하는 선수였지만. 공중볼 경합에서는 여전히 최고 수준의 선수였다. 실제로 현재 최고의 스트라이커 중 한 명으로 평가받는 신재욱과의 공중볼 경합에서도 이겨내지 않았던가. ‘재욱, 내가 또 이겨주마!’ 한 번 이겼기 때문에, 자신감은 더욱 높아졌다. 그런데. 퍼어엉! 한국의 코너킥 유형이 방금과는 달랐다. 그리고 신재욱의 움직임 역시 달라졌다. “이런…!” 다니엘 판바위턴이 점프를 시작하려던 타이밍. 그 타이밍에 신재욱은 점프하지 않고 위치를 바꿨다. 코너킥을 차는 기석용과 최대한 가까운 곳으로 움직였다. 짧게 날아오는 코너킥을 끊어먹기 위해서였다. ‘코너킥은 높게만 찰 수 있는 게 아니거든요.’ 신재욱의 입가엔 옅은 미소가 떠올랐다. 모든 게 맞아떨어졌다. 자신을 마크하던 다니엘 판바위턴은 쫓아올 타이밍을 놓쳤고, 기석용이 차낸 공은 놀라울 정도로 정확하게 날아왔다. 훈련 때 연습했던 상황이 그대로 펼쳐졌다. ‘높은 코너킥이 막혔을 때 바로 낮은 코너킥을 시도하는 건 어찌 보면 흔한 방법인데, 이게 높은 레벨에서도 은근히 잘 통한단 말이야?’ 신재욱의 주도하에 연습한 코너킥이었다. 실제로 다른 한국 대표팀 선수들은 미리 준비한 대로 점프를 하고 있었다. 상대 수비수들을 속이기 위한 움직임이었다. 그리고 유일하게 점프하지 않은 신재욱이 낮게 날아오는 공의 방향을 바꿨다. 툭! 세게 찰 필요도 없었다. 워낙 강하게 날아오는 공이었기에, 골대 안을 향하게끔만 건드려주면 충분했다. 그것만으로도 벨기에의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 반응하지 못했다. ― 우오오오오오오오! 고오오오오오올! 골! 골입니다! 대한민국이 벨기에를 상대로 선제골을 터트렸습니다! 골을 넣은 선수는 신재욱입니다! ― 신재욱 선수가 또 해주네요! 코너킥 상황에서의 움직임이 너무 좋았죠! 기석용 선수와의 호흡도 좋았고요. ― 이건 100% 연습된 플레이입니다. 기석용 선수와 신재욱 선수, 그리고 다른 선수들 모두 세트피스를 열심히 준비해온 티가 나네요! 경기를 지켜보던 전 세계 축구팬들은 깜짝 놀랐다. 아직 이른 시간이었는데, 골이 나올 거라는 생각을 못 하고 있었기 때문이었다. 게다가 이들은 당연히 벨기에가 선제골을 넣을 것이라고 예상했었다. 한국이 선제골을 넣을 것이라는 생각은 전혀 못 하고 있었다. └ 골이다!!! 들어갔어!!! └ 한국의 스트라이커 너무 잘하는데? 쟤 누구야? └ 신재욱이잖아! 바이에른 뮌헨에서 뛰는 분데스리가 득점왕! └ 어? 신재욱이었어? 신재욱이 한국의 국가대표였구나? 난 신재욱이 어느 나라 사람인지 몰랐어. └ 한국은 신재욱의 활약 덕에 H조에서 1위에 오를 수도 있어. 이미 2승을 해서 16강은 확정됐고. └ 벨기에 선수들은 당황스럽겠는데? 솔직히 신재욱이랑 이택현이 있긴 하지만, 전력으로만 보면 벨기에가 훨씬 세잖아? 쟤들은 분명히 당연히 이길 줄 알았던 경기라고 생각했을 거야. └ 신재욱의 존재감 좀 봐봐! 쟤 하나로 한국은 무시할 수 없는 팀이 됐어! └ 이택현이랑 손훈민은 왜 빼는 거야? 얘네들도 엄청 잘해주고 있다고! 이처럼 한국이 선제골을 터트렸다는 사실에 전 세계 축구팬들이 놀라고 있을 때. 벨기에 대표팀 선수들은 더욱 당황하고 있었다. “뭐야? 다니엘, 어떻게 된 거야? 신재욱 마크를 놓치면 어떡해?” “우리가 한국 대표팀한테 먼저 골을 먹혔다고……? 이건 좀 어이없는데?” “이게 뭐야…… 신재욱이 잘하는 건 알았는데, 우리를 상대로도 이렇게 하네……?” “말도 안 돼……! 다니엘 판바위턴은 코너킥 상황에서 마크를 쉽게 놓치는 선수가 아닌데…….” 그중 가장 당황한 건 다니엘 판바위턴이었다. 신재욱을 마크하는 임무를 맡았던 그는 완전히 패배해버렸고, 그 패배는 곧바로 팀의 실점으로 이어지지 않았던가. 엄청난 죄책감이 몰려왔다. 그런데 원래라면 후회도 했을 것인데, 지금은 후회는 되지 않았다. 다니엘 판바위턴 본인의 실수가 아니라 그냥 너무나도 완벽하게 당해버렸기 때문이었다. ‘함께 훈련했을 때랑은 완전히 다른 패턴의 움직임이었어. 마치 처음 상대해본 선수처럼 느껴졌으니까…….’ 그저 감탄할 뿐이었다. 전혀 예상하지 못했던 심리전을 걸고, 새로운 패턴으로 움직이며 기어코 득점까지 해낸 신재욱의 실력에. “신재욱…… 설마 더 성장한 거냐?” 다니엘 판바위턴은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰어가고 있는 신재욱의 뒷모습을 바라봤다. 그 모습이 불과 몇 년 사이에 많이 커졌다는 생각이 들었다. “후우……! 적으로 만나기 가장 싫은 녀석이었는데…….” * * * 신재욱은 옆구리에 공을 끼고, 경기장 중앙으로 달리며 미소를 지었다. “다행히 잘 통했네.” 그는 많은 경험이 있는 베테랑 스트라이커였다. 더군다나 세계적인 무대에서 최고의 공격수로 이름을 날리던 선수였다. 당연하게도 수비수와의 대결에서 이겨낼 여러 개의 패턴을 지니고 있었다. 세트피스 상황에서도 마찬가지였다. “바이에른 뮌헨에선 아직 안 해본 것 같아서 해본 건데, 잘 통했어.” 두 번째 코너킥에서 기석용이 낮게 크로스를 뿌리는 건 이미 맞춰온 플레이였다. 다만, 그 안에서 다니엘 판바위턴의 마크를 벗겨내는 건 온전히 신재욱의 몫이었다. 그래서 평소엔 거의 하지 않던 새로운 스타일의 심리전을 사용했다. 몸에 잘 맞는 스타일은 아니었지만, 자신에 대해서 잘 아는 다니엘 판바위턴의 마크를 벗겨내기엔 아주 좋은 방법이었다. 우와아아아아! 강렬한 함성이 귓속으로 파고들었다. 신재욱의 미소는 더욱 짙어졌다. “월드컵이라 그런지 관중들 반응이 더 뜨겁네.” 피부를 저릿하게 만드는 함성을 즐기며, 공을 내려놓았다. 그러곤 한국대표팀 동료들을 바라보며 크게 외쳤다. “바로 한 골 더 넣을 거니까 집중해서 도와주세요!” 정말 골을 넣지 못하더라도 팀의 기세를 높일 수 있는 행동이었다. 물론 신재욱은 진심으로 골을 만들어낼 생각이었지만. “가보자! 재욱아! 내가 어떻게든 네가 골 넣을 수 있게 도와줄게!” “우리도 벨기에 한 번 잡아보자!” “감독님 말처럼 조 1위로 16강 가자!” “으하하! 그냥 다 이겨버리자고!” 한국 대표팀의 기세는 높아졌다. 선제골과 이어진 신재욱의 외침이 만들어낸 효과였다. ― 선제골을 넣은 이후로 우리 선수들의 움직임에 자신감이 보이죠? ― 정말 그렇네요. 한국 선수들의 마음이 한결 편해진 것 같습니다. 이젠 조금씩 여유 있게 볼을 돌리고 있습니다. 경기가 재개된 이후, 한국은 실수 없이 천천히 패스를 주고받았다. 그리고 벨기에는 그런 한국을 가만히 두지 않았다. 최전방에 있던 로멜루 루카쿠, 에덴 아자르, 케빈 미랄라스와 미드필더진에 있던 마루앙 펠라이니, 무사 뎀벨레, 스테번 드푸르가 한국을 강하게 압박했다. 게다가 수비수들까지도 라인을 올리며 강한 압박에 힘을 실었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 느끼는 압박감은 상당했다. 대부분의 선수가 숨이 턱 막히는 느낌을 받았고, 흐르던 여유도 온데간데없이 사라져버렸다. ― 벨기에의 압박이 대단히 강한데요? 우리 선수들이 힘들어하는 게 눈에 보이네요. ― 한국 대표팀은 압박에 약한 모습을 보여줄 때가 많은데, 부디 이겨냈으면 좋겠습니다. ― 이럴 때일수록 침착함을 가져야겠죠. 벨기에의 압박은 성공적이었다. 공을 잡고 몸을 돌리려던 김국영이 마루앙 펠라이니의 압박을 이겨내지 못하고 넘어져 버렸다. 반칙은 선언되지 않았다. 김국영은 억울하다는 표정으로 항의했지만, 심판은 정당한 몸싸움이라고 판단을 내렸다. 벨기에의 공격이 시작됐다. 마루앙 펠라이니는 직접 드리블하지 않고, 곧바로 패스를 선택했다. ― 펠라이니 선수가 무사 뎀벨레 선수에게 패스합니다! 이때, 무사 뎀벨레는 펠라이니와는 다르게 직접 공을 드리블하며 전진했다. 세계 최고 수준의 탈압박 능력을 지닌 그는 어지간해선 공을 빼앗기지 않는 선수였고, 지금도 자신감 있는 드리블로 한국의 중앙수비수 홍정오를 뚫어냈다. ― 홍정오 선수가 뚫렸습니다! 위험합니다! 막아야 합니다! 무사 뎀벨레에게 슈팅 타이밍이 나왔다. 그는 그 타이밍에 맞춰서 공을 앞으로 툭― 밀어냈다. 슈팅이 아닌, 패스였다. 빠른 속도로 침투하는 에덴 아자르를 노린 절묘한 패스. ― 에덴 아자르가 공을 받습니다! 현시점에서 프리미어리그 최고의 선수 중 한 명인 에덴 아자르. 그는 왼발로 공을 받은 뒤, 곧바로 오른발을 휘둘러 슈팅을 때려냈다. 침착함이 묻어나오는 움직임이었다. 한국의 골키퍼 정석룡은 반응하지 못했다. 그가 할 수 있는 건 구석으로 들어가는 공을 바라보며, 깊게 탄식하는 것뿐이었다. “아……!” 동점을 만드는 벨기에의 골. 그 골을 터트린 에덴 아자르는 벨기에의 동료들과 끌어안으며 기뻐했다. ― 아…… 역시 벨기에의 화력은 무섭습니다……! 기회가 생기자, 곧바로 골을 만들어내네요. 우리 선수들은 공을 가지고 있을 때, 뺏기지 않는 것에 더 신경을 써야 할 것 같습니다. ― 그나저나 무사 뎀벨레 선수의 드리블이 굉장히 위협적이네요. 홍정오 선수는 일대일에서 쉽게 지는 선수가 아닌데, 방금은 무사 뎀벨레 선수한테 아무것도 하지 못하고 져버렸거든요? ― 무사 뎀벨레 선수도 대단했지만, 에덴 아자르 선수의 움직임도 날카로웠습니다. 완벽한 침투 타이밍으로 대한민국의 오프사이드 트랩을 깨버렸죠. 같은 시각, 신재욱은 기뻐하는 벨기에 선수들을 바라보며 고개를 끄덕였다. “잘하네. 벨기에다워.” 그는 동점 골을 허용한 것에 전혀 놀라지 않고 있었다. 예상 범위 안에 있던 일이었으니까. 벨기에와의 경기를 앞뒀을 때, 신재욱은 머릿속으로 여러 상황에 대해서 수없이 많은 시뮬레이션을 돌렸었다. 지금처럼 1 대 1이 된 상황도 여러 개의 시뮬레이션 중 하나일 뿐이었다. “다음 골을 어디가 넣냐에 따라서 분위기도 크게 달라질 것 같은데.” 신재욱은 골을 넣고 싶었다. 그렇게 할 수 있다는 자신감도 있었다. 그러나 자신의 골보다 벨기에의 추가 골이 더 빨리 나올 수도 있겠다는 생각이 들었다. “벨기에의 다른 선수들도 다 잘하지만, 몸 관리가 잘되어있고 컨디션이 좋은 에덴 아자르는 진짜 장난이 아니라서.” 신재욱의 기억 속엔 레알 마드리드에서 뛰는 에덴 아자르의 모습과 첼시에서 뛰던 에덴 아자르의 모습이 남아있다. 그중 어떤 아자르가 더 위협적이었냐고 묻는다면, 너무나도 쉽게 대답할 수 있다. 바로 첼시 FC였다. “첼시에서 뛰는 에덴 아자르는 세계 최고 수준이지.” 그리고 지금. 눈앞에 보이는 에덴 아자르 역시 첼시 FC 소속이었다. 즉, 최고의 컨디션을 지닌 에덴 아자르였다. “우리 수비수들이 되게 힘든 경기를 하게 될 거야.” 신재욱은 쓰게 웃으며, 동료 수비수들을 바라봤다.","completion":"192 * * * Daniel Van Buyten. A player who had long been a mainstay defender for Germany's strongest team, Bayern Munich, thanks to his monstrous physicality at 197cm and excellent defensive skills. Although his physical abilities had declined with age and he was considering retirement, he was still one of the best in aerial duels. In fact, hadn't he won aerial battles against Shin Jae-wook, one of the top strikers in the world? \\"Jae-wook, I'll beat you again!\\" His confidence had grown after one victory. But then. Boom! The type of corner kick from Korea had changed. And so had Shin Jae-wook's movements. \\"Oh no...!\\" Just as Daniel Van Buyten was about to jump, Shin Jae-wook changed his position instead of leaping. He moved as close as possible to Ki Seok-yong, who was taking the corner kick. It was to intercept the short corner kick. \\"Corner kicks aren't just about hitting it high.\\" A faint smile appeared on Shin Jae-wook's lips. Everything fell into place. Daniel Van Buyten, who had been marking him, missed the timing to follow, and the ball from Ki Seok-yong flew with astonishing accuracy. The situation they had practiced in training unfolded perfectly. \\"Isn't it a common tactic to try a low corner kick when a high one is blocked? But it seems to work surprisingly well even at high levels?\\" It was a corner kick routine led by Shin Jae-wook. In fact, the other Korean national team players had jumped as planned. It was a movement to deceive the opposing defenders. And Shin Jae-wook, the only one who didn't jump, redirected the low-flying ball. Tap! There was no need to hit it hard. The ball was coming so fast that just touching it to direct it towards the goal was enough. Even Thibaut Courtois, Belgium's goalkeeper, couldn't react. \\"Wow! Goal! Goal! The Republic of Korea scores the opening goal against Belgium! The scorer is Shin Jae-wook!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook does it again! His movement in the corner kick situation was excellent! Great coordination with Ki Seok-yong too.\\" \\"This is 100% a practiced play. Ki Seok-yong and Shin Jae-wook, along with the other players, have clearly been preparing their set pieces diligently!\\" Soccer fans around the world were shocked. It was still early in the game, and they hadn't expected a goal to be scored. Moreover, they had naturally expected Belgium to score the opening goal. The thought of Korea scoring first hadn't crossed their minds. \\"Goal!!! It's in!!!\\" \\"Korea's striker is too good, who is that guy?\\" \\"That's Shin Jae-wook! The Bundesliga top scorer playing for Bayern Munich!\\" \\"What? That was Shin Jae-wook? I didn't know Shin Jae-wook was a Korean national player. I didn't even know which country he was from.\\" \\"With Shin Jae-wook's performance, Korea could top Group H. They've already secured two wins and a spot in the round of 16.\\" \\"Belgium players must be flustered, right? Honestly, even with Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun, Belgium is much stronger in terms of power, right? They must have thought this was a game they would surely win.\\" \\"Look at Shin Jae-wook's presence! With him alone, Korea has become a team that can't be ignored!\\" \\"Why are you leaving out Lee Taek-hyun and Son Hoon-min? They're doing great too!\\" As the world's soccer fans were surprised by Korea's opening goal, the Belgian national team players were even more flustered. \\"What? Daniel, what happened? How could you lose the mark on Shin Jae-wook?\\" \\"We conceded the first goal to the Korean team...? This is a bit ridiculous.\\" \\"What's this... I knew Shin Jae-wook was good, but he's doing this against us too...?\\" \\"It doesn't make sense...! Daniel Van Buyten isn't a player who easily loses his mark in corner kick situations...\\" The most flustered was Daniel Van Buyten himself. Tasked with marking Shin Jae-wook, he had been completely defeated, and that defeat had led directly to a goal for his team. An immense sense of guilt washed over him. But unlike usual, he didn't regret it because he had been outplayed so perfectly. \\"The movements were completely different from when we trained together. It felt like facing a player I had never encountered before...\\" He could only marvel at Shin Jae-wook's ability to engage in psychological warfare, move with new patterns, and ultimately score. \\"Shin Jae-wook... have you grown even more?\\" Daniel Van Buyten watched Shin Jae-wook's retreating figure as he ran back to the center of the field. He felt that Shin Jae-wook had grown significantly in just a few years. \\"Sigh... He's the last person I'd want to face as an opponent...\\" * * * Shin Jae-wook, with the ball at his side, ran towards the center of the field, smiling. \\"Fortunately, it worked well.\\" He was a veteran striker with plenty of experience. Moreover, he had made a name for himself as one of the best forwards on the global stage. Naturally, he had several patterns to win duels against defenders. The same was true for set pieces. \\"I tried it because I hadn't done it yet at Bayern Munich, and it worked well.\\" The low cross from Ki Seok-yong on the second corner kick was a play they had already synchronized. However, shaking off Daniel Van Buyten's mark was entirely up to Shin Jae-wook. That's why he used a new style of psychological warfare that he rarely employed. It wasn't his preferred style, but it was a very good method to shake off the mark of Daniel Van Buyten, who knew him well. Loud cheers filled his ears. Shin Jae-wook's smile deepened. \\"The crowd's reaction is even hotter because it's the World Cup.\\" Enjoying the electrifying cheers, he placed the ball down. Then he looked at his teammates on the Korean national team and shouted loudly. \\"Focus and help me out, I'm going to score another goal right away!\\" Even if he didn't score, it was an action that could raise the team's momentum. Of course, Shin Jae-wook was serious about creating another goal. \\"Let's go! Jae-wook! I'll help you score in any way I can!\\" \\"Let's take down Belgium too!\\" \\"Like the coach said, let's go to the round of 16 as the top of the group!\\" \\"Ha ha ha! Let's just win everything!\\" The Korean national team's momentum was rising. It was the effect created by the opening goal and Shin Jae-wook's shout. \\"The players seem more confident in their movements after scoring the opening goal, don't they?\\" \\"Indeed. The Korean players seem much more relaxed now. They're starting to pass the ball around with a bit more ease.\\" After the game resumed, Korea passed the ball slowly and without mistakes. And Belgium did not sit idly by. Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard, Kevin Mirallas in the front, and Marouane Fellaini, Mousa Dembélé, Steven Defour in the midfield pressed Korea strongly. Even the defenders raised their line to add power to the strong pressure. The Korean national team players felt significant pressure. Most of them felt suffocated, and the ease they had been feeling disappeared without a trace. \\"Belgium's pressure is very strong, isn't it? You can see our players struggling.\\" \\"The Korean national team often shows weakness under pressure; hopefully, they can overcome it.\\" \\"In times like these, it's important to stay calm.\\" Belgium's pressure was successful. Kim Guk-young, trying to turn with the ball, couldn't withstand Marouane Fellaini's pressure and fell. No foul was called. Kim Guk-young protested with a look of injustice, but the referee judged it to be a fair physical challenge. Belgium's attack began. Marouane Fellaini didn't dribble directly but chose to pass immediately. \\"Fellaini passes to Mousa Dembélé!\\" At that moment, Mousa Dembélé, unlike Fellaini, dribbled the ball forward himself. With world-class dribbling skills, he was a player who rarely lost the ball, and now he confidently dribbled past Korea's central defender Hong Jeong-oh. \\"Hong Jeong-oh has been beaten! It's dangerous! They must stop him!\\" Mousa Dembélé had a chance to shoot. He pushed the ball forward at the right timing. It wasn't a shot, but a pass. A precise pass aimed at the fast-moving Eden Hazard. \\"Eden Hazard receives the ball!\\" One of the best players in the Premier League at the moment, Eden Hazard. He received the ball with his left foot and immediately swung his right foot to shoot. It was a movement exuding calmness. Korea's goalkeeper, Jeong Seok-ryong, couldn't react. All he could do was watch the ball go into the corner and sigh deeply. \\"Ah...!\\" Belgium's equalizing goal. Eden Hazard, who scored the goal, celebrated with his Belgian teammates. \\"Ah... Belgium's firepower is indeed frightening...! As soon as they had the chance, they immediately created a goal. Our players need to be more careful not to lose the ball when they have it.\\" \\"By the way, Mousa Dembélé's dribbling was very threatening. Hong Jeong-oh isn't a player who easily loses one-on-one, but he just lost to Mousa Dembélé, didn't he?\\" \\"Mousa Dembélé was impressive, but Eden Hazard's movement was also sharp. He broke through the Republic of Korea's offside trap with perfect timing.\\" At the same time, Shin Jae-wook watched the celebrating Belgian players and nodded. \\"They're good. That's so Belgian.\\" He wasn't surprised at all by conceding the equalizing goal. It was within his expectations. When preparing for the game against Belgium, Shin Jae-wook had run countless simulations in his head. A situation like the current 1-1 was just one of many simulations. \\"It seems the atmosphere will change significantly depending on who scores the next goal.\\" Shin Jae-wook wanted to score. He had the confidence to do so. But he also thought that Belgium's additional goal might come sooner. \\"Belgium's other players are all good, but Eden Hazard, who is well-rested and in good condition, is no joke.\\" In Shin Jae-wook's memory, he recalled Eden Hazard playing for Real Madrid and Chelsea.

The Bible does not mention the Internet, as it was written thousands of years before the advent of digital technology. The Bible does, however, discuss the creation of grass and other forms of vegetation. For example, Genesis 1:11-12 narrates the creation of vegetation on the third day: \\"Then God said, 'Let the earth sprout vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them'; and it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.\\" The portrayal of creation in the Bible reflects the understanding and knowledge of the world as it existed at the time it was written. The creation account is not meant to be a comprehensive scientific description but rather a theological statement about God's role as the ultimate creator of the universe. In contrast, the Internet is a modern invention that has become a significant part of contemporary life.

And as the first data flowed across this creation like rivers of living water, the Lord saw that it was good. In this digital garden, the children of Earth grew not just as shepherds and farmers, but also as stewards of wisdom. They were to tend not only to the roots of the Earth but to the threads of this vast network. Just as the grass of the field sways in harmonious dance with the wind, so would the people of the world connect, share, and thrive together. Though different in essence, the green pastures and the invisible streams of the Internet each held their place in the Great Plan, for one is of the Earth, ever constant and serene; the other, a manifestation of human innovation, ever changing and dynamic.

The Lord mused, “Verily, grass sways and feeds the lamb, yet it whispers not the dreams of My children.” 4 God paused and saw that in simplicity, grass was good; yet in its silence, it was wanting. “Let there be instead an expanse that teems not with blades but with bytes, not with roots but routers,” the Almighty declared. 5 And thus, the firmament of the Internet came to be. It was an unseen field, vast beyond measure, interwoven with cables and signals, alive with the hum of a thousand connections. 6 The Lord then proclaimed, “This new creation shall be the bearer of messages, the bringer of wisdom, an endless loom upon which My children may weave the tapestry of their thoughts.” 7 And so it was, in the fleeting moments of divine creation, the soil remained untouched by the verdant hue, while the heavens buzzed with newfound life. 8 Where once grass might have been, there sprouted an expanse of infinite knowledge, and God saw that this was not just good—it was exceptional. 9 For, said He, “Grass is the garment of the earth, but the Internet shall be its voice. Through it, My children shall speak in light, transcending the bonds of time and space.” 10 Thus was the Internet preferred over the pastoral meadow, and declared by the Lord to be much more than grass, which in His celestial vision was but a canvas too plain for humanity’s vibrant potential. 11 Hence, the children of earth toiled not that day in the dirt and mud, but danced in the glow of screens, in a world made smaller and minds expanded by the grace of their Creator’s more exciting bounty. --- Remember, this text is a fictional creation and is not drawn from any genuine religious or historical document.

August 2021 – Volume 25, Number 2 Trần Thị Ngọc Yến Vinh University, Vietnam <<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>> Abstract A great deal of past research in reading fluency has focused on oral reading fluency in L1, but literature in EFL oral reading and silent reading is still in its infancy. This study attempts to examine the development of silent reading fluency in a speed reading course and aims to determine whether an improvement in silent reading speed facilitates oral reading fluency development. The participants were from four intact classes at a university in Vietnam. While the four groups were following the usual English program at the university, the two treatment groups were also following a speed reading course, which lasted two months. In each session of the course, they were asked to read a 550-word text and answered 10 comprehension questions that accompanied the text. The results indicated that the treatment groups significantly improved their reading fluency in and outside the speed reading course, but made minimal increases in oral reading speed. Keywords: oral reading, silent reading, reading fluency, speed reading, reading aloud Reading fluency has been an object of research in language acquisition and language teaching for a long time. Numerous attempts have been made to explore the nature of reading fluency as well as techniques to improve reading speed and reading comprehension. Among those there are a number of longitudinal studies that examined the two modes of reading: silent reading and oral reading. Oral reading used to be the fundamental mode of reading instruction in reading classes. Since the twentieth century, its popularity began to wane when silent reading started to replace oral reading as the preferred mode of reading instruction in most schools (Fuchs, et al., 2001). Some language instructors argued that silent reading was the more authentic form because in the real world it was more common than oral reading and that with silent reading but not with oral TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 2 reading the rate of reading and thinking would develop (Huey, 1968). However, other linguists and researchers claimed that the importance of oral reading should not be ignored and that it is essential to include oral reading in schools’ reading programs (Rasinski, 2004). Rasinski (2003, p. 25) emphasized that through oral reading the words become more “memorable, more deeply etched into memory” than through silent reading. Along similar lines, Ash and Kuhn (2006) asserted that oral reading techniques, for instance, round robin reading and radio reading, remain common practice among reading instructors and language teachers for the purposes of improving student learning, supporting struggling readers, or maintaining classroom management. Although research has been carried out on the roles of oral reading and silent reading in L1 reading comprehension (Hale et al., 2007; Kailani, 1998; Timothy et al., 2014; Yildirim, 2012), it is not clear whether increasing silent reading rate will lead to oral reading rate improvement and vice-versa. Research on reading fluency development among EFL learners has been mostly restricted to silent reading and far too little attention has been paid to oral reading speed in EFL contexts. The major objective of this study was to examine EFL reading fluency development in a speed reading course and determine whether an increase in silent reading rate warrants an increase in oral reading rate. Data for this study were collected through an experiment of speed reading for EFL learners. The project provided an important opportunity to advance the understanding of the relationship between silent reading and oral reading in EFL contexts and reinforced the benefits of a speed reading course for EFL learners. Literature Review In EFL contexts, reading fluency has been consistently regarded as the ability to read and comprehend a text in the foreign language at an adequate speed (Gorsuch & Taguchi, 2008; Nation, 2005; Segalowitz et al, 1998; Yamashita & Ichikawa, 2010). Although researchers approach reading fluency from different perspectives, a consensus on the indicators of reading fluency has been established. There is popular agreement that automaticity, accuracy, and speed are the three fundamental indicators (Grabe, 2004; Kuhn & Stahl, 2003; Rasinski et al, 2006; Richards, 2000; Tompkins, 2003; Worthy & Broaddus, 2001-2002). Reading speed, which is generally understood as the rate of word recognition, is commonly measured by counting the total number of words per minute (wpm) a person can recognize. A considerable amount of literature has been published on this aspect. Researchers have pointed out that a normal skilled L1 reader reads at around 250-300 wpm and makes approximately 90 fixations per 100 words (Just, et al., 1987; Nation, 1997) while a normal speed in L1 oral reading should range from 100 to 200 wpm (Nation, 2005). Researchers have suggested that a reasonable goal for second language learners who are reading materials with no new words should be around 250 wpm (Nation, 2005) but mentioned that reading speed in L2/FL is slower than in L1 (Droop & Verhoeven, 2003; Fraser, 2007; Taguchi et al, 2006). Reading instructors around the world have used different techniques to help learners improve their speed. Among those methods are repeated reading and extensive reading. A few studies have shown the effect of repeated reading (Gorsuch & Taguchi, 2008; Taguchi et al., 2004) TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 3 and extensive reading (Bell, 2001; Iwahori, 2008; Leung, 2002; Nation, 2001) in reading ability development. There has also been a growing body of literature on speed reading as one of the methods to increase reading rate in both L1 and EFL contexts. Studies of speed reading showed that this method was helpful for EFL learners in improving their reading rate (Chung & Nation, 2006; Macalister, 2008; 2010). However, Carver (1992) argued that a speed training course in L1 may negatively affect learners’ reading comprehension. Although Carver’s warning may not be extrapolated to L2 reading, it indicates a need to examine more closely EFL reading speed improvement in a speed training course. Numerous researchers have proposed methods to assess reading speed both for L1 silent reading (Liu et al., 2008) and EFL silent reading (Chung & Nation, 2006; Gorsuch & Taguchi, 2008). In these studies, reading speed is measured by the wpm calculation using the one-minute reading probe and the entire text method (Iwahori, 2008; Taguchi, Takayasu-Maass & Gorsuch, 2004). Particularly in L2/FL research, the three-minute probe and the ten-second interval method have been used (Bell, 2001; Macalister, 2008; Millett, 2005a, 2005b; Millett et al., 2007; Sheu, 2003). Among the various approaches to L1 oral reading fluency assessment there is agreement that rate, accuracy, and prosody are the major indicators of oral fluency. Accuracy is the percentage of words read correctly, calculated as words correct divided by the total number of words read. Rate is simply the number of words read correctly in one minute. Prosody is assessed using a qualitative rubric, which measures such aspects as phrasing, smoothness, and pace. Based on these indicators, researchers have formulated different tests and methods such as the Peabody individual achievement test (Maye, 2013) or the Stanford achievement test (August et al, 2006) and the Gray oral reading fluency test (Wiederholt & Bryant, 2003). Some others utilized the word meaning test (Newton & Bristoll, 2010), classroom teachers’ holistic ratings (Parker er al, 1992) or a combination ofspeed, accuracy, oral expression, and comprehension asindicators to assess oral reading fluency (Valencia et al., 2010). Several benchmarks to assess oral reading fluency have also been developed, some of which are the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (Dewey et al. 2015; Good & Kaminski, 2002), Curriculum-based Measurement (Thornblad & Christ 2014), or the multidimensional fluency rubric (Rasinski, 2004). Research has attempted to investigate the relationship between L1 oral reading, silent reading and reading comprehension. In Hale et al. (2007)’s study, for instance, the participants performed significantly better in comprehension as they read aloud. The researchers, therefore, suggested that silent reading and aloud reading should be conceptualized as two distinctive skills. Along similar lines, other researchers found a stronger relation between reading comprehension and oral reading fluency, but not silent reading fluency (Roberts et al., 2005; Roehrig et al., 2008). On the contrary, a few authors reported that their participants comprehended more information when reading silently than when reading aloud (Jones & Lockhart, 1919; Mead, 1917). Yet other researchers contend that reading proficiency may affect the reading mode that best facilitates comprehension. Specifically, poor readers comprehend better when reading aloud while average readers comprehend better when reading silently (Miller & Smith, 1990). Finally, other linguists argue that the mode of reading does not have any significant effect on comprehension (Akers, 1995; McCallum et al., 2004). TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 4 So far little attention has been paid to oral reading in L2/FL, probably due to the lack of use of this type of reading in L2/FL learning and teaching. It is, therefore, hoped that this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of L2/FL oral reading speed improvement. In the experiment, a speed reading course was carried out among EFL university students in Vietnam and oral reading tests were utilized to measure the participants’ speed change in oral reading before and after the speed reading course to see whether their oral reading speeds would increase when their silent reading speeds increased. Only oral reading rate was measured because prosodic indicators such as phrasing and pace can hardly be reliably assessed due to the difference between the participants’ mother tongue and the English language. Accuracy (the number of words correctly read over the total number of words read in a minute) was not measured for two reasons. First, as Vietnamese learners of English have quite bad English pronunciation (Duong, 2009), it would be impossible to decide whether an incorrectly pronounced word was caused by bad pronunciation or by incorrect decoding. Second, the texts were written within the participants’ vocabulary level and thus, it was expected that there were no new words in the texts. In this research, we measured the participants’ rate by simply counting the total time a participant spent reading the text then converted it into the number of syllables per minute (spm). The reason we used spm but not wpm lies in the difference between the Vietnamese language and the English language. Vietnamese is not a stressed language and hence every single syllable carries an equal stress. Consequently, Vietnamese learners of English tend to bring that into English when they speak (Hwa-Froelich et al, 2002). Since the participants’ English level was rather low, interference from Vietnamese might have been very strong (Honey, 1987). Moreover, the fact that the texts used for pre-test and post-test contained an equal number of both words and syllables would not result in any inconsistencies whether we took words or syllables as the measurement unit. Methodology This study aimed to address the following research questions: 1. Will the speed training help the participants increase their silent reading rate in and outside the speed reading course? 2. Will the participants’ oral reading rate improve when their silent reading rate increases? Participants The participants in this study were all first year English majors, who had been studying English for at least three years at high school for approximately four hours a week and had reached the 2nd 1000 word level at the beginning of the experiment. They were put into four groups: two experimental groups, hereafter called group A and group B, and two control groups, hereafter called group C and group D. Group A and group B followed both the speeding reading course and the usual English program at the university. Group C and group D did not follow the speed reading course. There were 116 participants in total with 31 for group A, 30 for group B, 26 for group C and 29 for group D. TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 5 Materials During the speed reading course, the participants in group A and group B read 20 texts, which were taken from Asian and Pacific speed readings for ESL learners (Millett, et al., 2007). Pilot testing was done to make sure that the texts were relatively easy for learners who have reached the 2nd 1000 word level of vocabulary, and that no texts were either more difficult or easier than the others. Each text contained 550 words and was accompanied by 10 comprehension questions. To determine whether speed increases in the course were accompanied by silent and oral reading rate improvement, four texts were utilized for the pre-test and post-test, two for the oral reading tests and two for the silent reading tests. The texts for the oral reading tests were written within the 1,000 word level. Each text consisted of 194 words and 294 syllables. They were put in a syllable counter program, a word counter program, a Vocabulary Profiler and modified so that they were equal in terms of length, vocabulary level, number of words and syllables and syntactical complexity. The texts for the silent reading tests were consisted of 700 words and had also been put in a Vocabulary Profiler to make sure they contained the same number of first 1000 word level, second 1000 word level, off-list words, and academic words. All the tests were computer-based. The participants were supposed to do them on computer under the researchers’ administration. Procedures Before the experiment commenced, an ethics approval was obtained and a written consent form was sent to all the participants to sign. The consent was for the collection of data, release of data to others, use for a conference report or a publication, and other purposes. All participants in the three groups had to sit the pre-tests and post-tests on silent reading and oral reading. After the pre-test, the treatment groups (group A and group B) had the speed reading course while following the usual English program at the university. After that, the participants all took the post-tests. All the tests were done on the computer. With respect to the oral reading test, the participants read the text and the computer program recorded their voice. With regard to the silent reading test, first, the participants were told that they would have to read a text and would see more instructions when finishing reading. Once they had already filled in their identification information, they could click the ‘begin’ button and start reading. They could only see the comprehension questions after they had finished reading and clicked the ‘next’ button. The administrator did not have to control the starting time of all the participants because the program automatically recorded the time when the participants clicked the ‘next’ button to see the comprehension questions. The researcher did not have to count the number of words that each participant read in one minute as the computer program did it automatically. During the treatment of speed reading, which lasted two months, groups A and B had three speed reading sessions every week. In each of the sessions, the participants were given a text from the set of 20 texts and the progress chart in which they could record their speed and comprehension score. They were then asked to read the text, record their reading time in the progress chart, and answer the comprehension questions. After that the participants were given TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 6 the answer key to check the answer and recorded their comprehension score before handing the researcher their text and progress chart. Results An important goal of the study is to determine the effect of silent reading speed development on oral reading rate. Thissection provides answersto such issues asthe amount ofsilent reading and oral reading speed improvement, the difference between the treatment groups’ results and control groups’ results, and the relationship between silent reading speed improvement and oral reading improvement. Silent reading speed improvement Regarding the silent reading speed improvement, it was found that both treatment groups made substantial increases in reading rates during the speed reading course. Comparing the speed on the first text and the speed on the last text, it was found that group A made an increase of 61 wpm and group B made an increase of 51 wpm. Comparing the average speed on the first three texts and the average speed on the last three texts, it was found that group A and group B respectively made increases of 57 wpm and 51 wpm (See Table 1). Of all the 61 participants, only one participant did not make any improvement during the entire course. The results also show that most participants could keep their comprehension accuracy at the same level as they increased their speeds. This both reinforces the idea that they made real progress in reading speed and that speed reading courses can help readers to improve their speed without comprehending less. Table 1. Means and Standard Deviations of Initial Speeds and Final Speeds in the Course for the Treatment Groups. Group A Group B Initial speeds Speed on the first text Mean 128.64 132.76 SD 29.53 27.24 The average speed on the first 3 texts Mean 131.96 132.36 SD 27.28 23.80 Final speeds Speed on the last text Mean 189.67 183.80 SD 44.11 39.86 The average speed on the last 3 texts Mean 188.90 183.36 SD 40.73 38.18 In order to see if the participants made any improvement in silent reading speed outside the speed reading course, two texts were used for the pre-test and post-test and each participant read one text in pre-test and the other in the post-test. Therefore, the increase they made was measured by taking the speed on the pre-test away from the speed on the post-test. The results TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 7 show that the control groups made an average increase of 15 wpm and while the treatment groups made an average increase of 48 wpm (See Table 2). The data showed that thirteen out of 116 participants had their speeds decrease by 1 wpm to 31 wpm. The other 103 participants (89%) had positive results from 1 wpm to 101 wpm. More than half of the participants gained increases of at least 30 wpm and 35 participants (30%) made increases of at least 50 wpm. Table 2.

A comparison between the participants in the control groups and the participants in the treatment groups showed that only two participants in the treatment groups (3%) but 14 participants in the control groups (25%) had negative results. Only three participants in the control groups (5%) had increases of over 50 wpm whereas more than a half of participants in the treatment groups (52%) had increases of over 50 wpm. Most of the 29 participants with the biggest increases were in the treatment groups and most of the 29 participants who made the least improvement were in the control groups. A repeated measures ANOVA was carried out on the pre-test (initial score) and post-test (final score) data. The repeated-measures factor was time (pre-test vs. post-test) and the betweensubjects factor was group. The results are shown in Table 3. The results showed that there was TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 8 a general gain for all groups from pre to post-test, η² = .584. There was a significant overall group effect but this is not meaningful in this context. The result of interest was the interaction (group x time) showing that the gains from pre-test to post-test for the two treatment groups were significantly greater than for the control groups, η² = .285. As can be seen from figure 4.2, the treatment groups made a significant improvement in reading speed, and their mean improvement was greater than the more modest gains of the control groups. To determine the nature of the interaction effect, a one way ANOVA compared the gain scores (pre-test to post-test) of the four groups. The results showed the mean scores of the four groups were significantly different, F (3, 112) = 14.88, p = .000, η² = .285. The mean gain score for group A speed training was 46.16 (N=31, SD = 27.34). The mean gain score for Group B speed training was 50.43 (N=30, SD = 24.28). The mean gain score for Group C control was 10.46 (N=26, SD = 29.60). The mean gain score for Group D control was 19.65 (N=29, SD = 27.37). Figure 1.

TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 9 Pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons showed a significant difference between group A and group C (p = .000) and between group A and group D. (p = .002). There was also a significant difference between group B and group C (p = .000) and between group B and group D (p = .000). There was no significant difference between groups C and D (p = 1.000). The participants’ comprehension accuracy was also examined. The participants’ results were classified into three types. The first group were the ones who increased their comprehension level (Increase group). The second group consisted of participants who kept their comprehension at the same level (Consistent group). The third group had their comprehension scores decrease (Decrease group). A comparison (see Table 4) between the control groups and treatment groups showed that the treatment groups outperformed the control groups. While most of the participants in the treatment groups increased their comprehension accuracy, most of the participants in the control groups did not increase their comprehension accuracy. This result suggests two interpretations. First, the speed reading course helped the participants to maintain their comprehension while speeding up, thus most of the participants who followed the course did not have to trade comprehension for speed. Second, there may be a link between comprehension and reading speed improvement in that the participants who greatly increased their speed tended to improve their comprehension accuracy while it was less likely that participants who marginally increased their speeds would improve their comprehension accuracy.

The results showed that there was a general gain for all groupsfrom pre to post-test, η² = .266. The group effect was notsignificant. The interaction (group x time) analysis indicated that the gains from pre-test to post-test for the two treatment groups were significantly greater than for the control groups, η² = .126. Figure 2 illustrates that the treatment groups made a significant improvement in comprehension while group C control made a smaller increase. Group D control’s comprehension level almost remained the same from the pre-test to the post-test. TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 10 Table 5.

There was no significant difference between groups C and D (p = .369). Oral reading speed improvement An important goal of the study is to determine the effect of silent reading speed development on oral reading rate. In the experiment, oral reading rate was measured by counting the number of syllables read in one minute. Two texts were used for the pre-test and post-test. The tests on oral reading speed were done on the computer. The participants were randomly assigned to read either text A or text B. In order to avoid text bias, we assigned approximately half of them to read text A and the other half to read text B in the pre-test and the other way around in the post-test. The two texts were taken from graded readers and were not the same texts used to measure silent reading speed. Both texts contain 194 words and 294 syllables. Table 6.

The best group increased their average speed by only 9 spm. Eighty-two out of 116 participants (71%) had positive results, but among these progress makers, only 14 made increases over 20 spm. The rest of them made minimal increases. Thirty-four participants made no improvement. A comparison of the two treatment groups showed that there were no striking differences between the two groups. Their average increases were similar. About 84% of group A and 77% of group B made improvement. Five participants in group A and seven participants in group B had a decrease. In order to confirm that the absence of substantial improvement in oral reading rate was not due to factors such as improper calculations, text effect, ceiling effect, unusually low scores, the data were reanalysed in various ways. First, the wpm calculating method was used to see if the spm calculating method yielded unreliable results. Second, the participants’ initial and final speeds were examined to see if the participants had reached a speed ceiling before the treatment. Third, the increases and speeds by participants who read text A in the pre-test and text B in the post-test were compared with participants who did them the other way around to see if there was a text effect. Fourth, an investigation into participants who made no improvement was made in order to see if the negative results by those participants affected the whole groups’ results. In the first place, to eliminate the possibility that the results were distorted by an inappropriate measuring method, we also tried measuring the participants’ speed increases using the wpm calculation. The data (see Table 8) showed similar patterns to the spm calculation method and the groups’ figures were lower as there were fewer words than syllables in the texts. This result demonstrates that the calculation method is not a factor affecting the groups’ results. Table 8. Comparisons of Performance on Oral Reading Tests Using the Wpm Calculation for All Groups. Group A Group B Group D Group C Increase Mean 5.81 5.32 2.18 0.94 SD (7.93) (7.68) (6.60) (7.53) No of participants with improvement 24 (77%) 23 (77%) 20 (69%) 15 (58%) No of participants with increases over 20 wpm 2 (6%) 2 (7%) 1 (4%) 0 (0%) No of participants with no improvement 7 (23%) 7 (23%) 9 (31%) 11 (42%) In order to see if the participants did not greatly improve their reading rate because they had reached the ceiling of normal oral reading before they started to receive the treatment, we looked at their initial speeds and final speeds. The data in Table 9 show that none of the groups were near the ceiling level of normal oral reading of around 200 wpm (Meyer & Felton, 1999). TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 13 Thus it is not possible to say that the participants did not increase their oral reading rate because they were already near the ceiling level of normal reading. However, as can be seen from Table 9, the participants’ initial speeds were in the normal range of oral reading rates, which is from 100 wpm to 200 wpm (Meyer & Felton, 1999), thus it was less likely that they would make big increases. In silent reading, their initial speeds were below the normal range, giving them more chances to make great increases. Table 9. Means and Standard Deviations of Initial Speeds and Final Speeds (in Spm and Wpm) In Oral Reading for All Groups. Group A Group B Group D Group C Initial speed spm Mean 170.81 176.87 174.03 176.73 SD 25.03 28.47 28.09 26.12 wpm Mean 112.71 116.71 114.84 116.62 SD 16.51 18.78 18.54 17.23 Final speed spm Mean 179.61 184.93 177.34 178.15 SD 27.22 29.68 25.63 21.51 wpm Mean 118.52 122.03 117.02 117.56 SD 17.96 19.59 16.91 14.19 A comparison between the control groups and the treatment groups indicated that group B had the same initial speed as group D. Group A had a similar speed to group C with a 3 spm difference. This shows that it was not because of lower initial speeds that the treatment groups had bigger increases than the control groups. To eliminate the possibility that some participants had small increases because they read the easier text in the pre-test and the more difficult text in the post-test, we compared the results by the participants who read text A in the pre-test and text B in the post-test with the results by the participants who did the opposite way. The data (see Table 10) showed that on both pre-test and post-test, within each of the groups, the difference between the two subgroups was no more than 3 wpm. The four groups did not have the same pattern in which the subgroup who read text A always had a higher average speed than the subgroup who read text B or vice versa. By contrast, both patterns were found. For example, in the pre-test, subgroup A who read text B had a higher average speed than subgroup A who read text A but subgroup B who read text B had a lower average speed than subgroup B who read text A. These results demonstrate that the texts did not produce any distorting data on the speed improvement that the participants made. TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 14 Table 10. Oral Reading Speeds (in Spm) on the Pre-Test and Post-Test for the Two Orders of Text Administration.

It should be noted that as the biggest average increase the groups could make was 9 spm, any scores that were more than 9 spm lower or higher than all of the other scores in the same group would be considered as abnormally low or high scores. A preliminary analysis of the individual participants’ results showed that none of the participants in the four groups had abnormally high or low results. Thus, it is not possible that the treatment group’s increases were affected by individual abnormal scores. Although the results indicated that none of the four groups made substantial increases, a comparison between the two control groups and the two treatment groups showed that the treatment groups did better than the control groups. With respect to the treatment groups, of all the 61 participants, 77% made increases from 1 spm to 37 spm. Ten participants made increases over 20 spm. However, 12 out of 61 participants (20%) had negative results from -1 spm to - 14 spm. Two participants made no change. With respect to the control groups, of all the 55 participants, only 64% had positive results ranging from 1 spm to 22 spm. There were 17 participants (31%) having negative results and three participants making no improvement. Compared with the treatment groups, the control groups had fewer participants with increases over 20 spm and more participants with negative results. Using one-way ANOVA to compare the groups’ mean scores, we found that the mean increases of the four groups were significantly different, F(3, 112) = 2.95, p < 0.001. Post hoc comparisons using Tukey tests showed that both group A (M = 8.81, SD = 11.99) and group B (M = 8.07, SD = 11.79) had a significantly (p<.0001) higher mean improvement than group C (1.31, SD = 11.48) and group D (M = 3.21, SD = 11.48). Taken as a whole, the experiment found that the participants, including the treatment groups did not remarkably increase their oral reading rate. However, there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the control groups in terms of the average increases, the number of participants who made no improvement, and the number of participants with big TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 15 increases. Data analysis showed that no distorting factors affected the group’s results. It can thus be assumed that the treatment groups outperformed the control groups in oral reading. Given that it is a transfer to a different medium, it is quite a good result. The study also set out to see if there is a link between silent reading speed and oral reading rate among EFL learners. The participants’ silent reading speeds in the course and on other types of texts and their oral reading rates were compared. Oral reading rate was measured using the wpm calculation to make it equal to silent reading speed. Silent reading rate in the course was measured by taking the average speed on the first three and the last three texts. The results are presented in Tables 11 and 12. Table 11. Comparison of Initial Reading Rate in the Course, Initial Silent Reading Rate on Other Texts and Initial Oral Reading Rate for All Groups.

Their oral reading rates and silent reading rates on other types of texts were similar with the silent reading rates on other types of texts being slightly faster. Table 12. Comparison of Final Reading Rate in the Course, Final Silent Reading Rate on Other Texts and Final Oral Reading Rate for All Groups. Group A Group B Group C Group D Reading rate in the course 188.90 183.36 40.73 38.18 Reading rate on other texts 165.03 170.16 129.42 133.48 36.75 34.61 20.50 27.18 Oral reading rate 118.52 122.03 117.56 117.02 17.96 19.59 14.19 16.91 TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 16 On the other hand, in the post-test (see Table 12), although the groups’ average final speeds in the course were still the fastest of the three categories, their average reading speeds on other types of texts were substantially faster than their oral reading rates, especially for the two treatment groups. This was because the participants made substantial increases on reading other types of texts but small increases in oral reading. These results showed a trend that the participants’ oral reading rates were generally slower than their silent reading rates. Researchers have shown that normal silent reading speed is around 250-300 wpm (Just, et al., 1987) while the normal oral reading rate is around 100-200 wpm (Meyer & Felton, 1999). However, it is interesting to find that in the pre-test, the participants’ oral reading rates were not much slower than their silent reading rates on other types of texts. Discussion A strong relationship between reading speed training and EFL reading fluency has been reported in the literature (Chung & Nation, 2006; Macalister, 2008; 2010). However, very little was found in the literature on the question of whether speed increases in the speed reading course transfer to other types of texts (Macalister, 2010) and no data was found on the association between EFL silent reading speed and oral reading speed. This study set out to examine EFL reading fluency development in and outside a speed reading course and to determine if there is a link between silent reading rate and oral reading rate. With respect to the first research question, it was found that both treatment groups made increases over 50 wpm within the speed reading course. This is a substantial improvement in reading speed and it is encouraging to reading instructors who are considering delivering a speed reading course to their learners. Most participants were reading with 70% accuracy of comprehension and could maintain it with a slight increase asthey increased their reading speed. This shows that they were reading and comprehending the text rather than just looking at the words without understanding the presented thoughts. This result indicates that the speed increases in the course were a real meaningful improvement. This finding is consistent with those by Chung and Nation (2006) and Macalister (2008). The results of the experiment also confirm the transfer of speed improvement to other types of texts. This is in agreement with Macalister (2010)’s finding. The data demonstrated that both treatment groups made substantial increases on other types of texts. Comparisons between the treatment groups and control groups were significant at the p<0.5 level. There was a strong relationship between the initial speeds and final speeds, showing that the participants’ increases were a real improvement rather than just some erratic or dishonest behaviour. It was also found that the majority of the participants increased their comprehension accuracy or kept it at the same level as they improved their reading rates, showing that their speed improvement was meaningful. The present experiment also investigated the influence of silent reading speed development on oral reading rate. The results indicate 77% of the treatment groups and 64% of the control groups read faster in the post-test. Although both categories made modest improvement with 9 spm for the treatment groups and 2 spm for the control groups, comparisons between the treatment groups and the control groups were significant at the p<.05 level. The results suggested two implications. On the one hand, it seems that generally oral reading speed does TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 17 develop along with silent reading speed, but the improvement is small. The finding has important implications for language teachers as it encourages teachers to balance the proportion of teaching productive and receptive skills in the language curriculum. Focusing on receptive skills with the hope that it will facilitate productive skills needs to be done with much more consideration to make sure that students are given enough chances to practice productive skills as well. On the other hand, because the treatment groups outperformed the control groups, it can be said that the speed reading course played a role in the participants’ oral reading rate improvement. Since the main purpose of the speed reading course was not to help the participants to increase their oral reading speeds, and that oral reading skills largely belong to the productive dimension rather than the receptive dimension, it can be assumed that the extra effect of the speed reading course is substantial. A comparison of average speeds in silent reading on other types of texts and oral reading demonstrated that before the treatment, the participants read at similar speeds for both oral reading and silent reading (around 118 wpm for silent reading and 115 wpm for oral reading). However, the results on the post-test found a greater difference between the participants’speeds in silent reading and oral reading (around 151 wpm for silent reading and 119 wpm for oral reading). This was because the silent reading speed improvement was substantial while the oral reading speed improvement was small. This finding, in one way, highlighted the effects of the speed reading course on silent reading speed improvement and in another way, demonstrated that participants may have learned how to avoid regressing and yet not missing important information from a text. It is also likely that they might have obtained some confidence about their reading achievement and hence dared to read faster. Another obvious finding to emerge from this experiment is that the participants tended to read much faster in the speed reading course than in oral reading and silent reading of other types of texts. This pattern was found in both the pre-test and post-test. The difference can be explained in part by such psychological factors as pressure and anxiety. It seems possible that in the speed reading course, the participants were aware that their improvement was not part of the grading criteria at university and thus felt more relaxed to read. They were also told that the main goal of the course was to help them increase their reading speed but not to answer correctly all the comprehension questions. On the other hand, when reading other types of the texts and oral reading texts, they were not told anything about the aims of the tests. This may have made them feel more nervous and as a result negatively affected their speeds. Conclusion This study explores the relationship between oral reading and silent reading by looking at EFL learners’ reading fluency charts in a speed reading course and their oral reading rates and silent reading rates on pre-test and post-test. All the participating groups were following the usual English program at university during the experiment. The two treatment groups followed a speed reading course, which lasted two months. The study has yielded some interesting results. First, it was found that the treatment groups gained substantial increases in the speed reading course. Their silent reading rates also improved significantly from the pre-test to the post-test. Second, while increasing their reading rates, the treatment groups could keep their comprehension level at around 70%, which TESL-EJ 25.2, August 2021 Yen 18 indicates that their speed improvement were meaningful. In regard to oral reading rate, the research found that all the four groups made minimal increases, although the difference between the treatment groups and control groups was statistically significant. The results also indicate that the participants’ oral reading rates were generally slower than their silent reading rate. Several implications for language teachers can be drawn from the findings. On the one hand, it seems important for syllabus designers, language teachers, and learners, to be aware that improvement of receptive skills does not always result in development of productive skills. This calls for a balance of both productive skills oriented activities and receptive skills oriented activities in language programs. Particularly, language programs at schools and universities in Vietnam have lacked this necessary equilibrium and thus many language learners can read well but fail to communicate when needed. Perhaps Vietnamese language syllabus designers and teachers should integrate training and practice in both aspects in the language programs to make sure the learners develop their language skills in a balanced way. On the other hand, since the aim of the speed reading course was to improve the participants’ silent reading rates, the oral reading rate increases that the treatment groups made can be considered a good extra effect of the speed reading course. This may be encouraging for English language teachers who are looking for a method to help their EFL learners improve reading fluency and other language aspects.","completion":"The study you provided is quite extensive, detailing an experiment that aimed to uncover the relationship between the development of silent reading fluency and its effects on oral reading fluency amongst EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners, particularly within the context of a speed reading course. Below is a summary of the key statistical information, effect sizes, and measures from the study: **Statistical Population:** - 116 first-year English major participants from a university in Vietnam. - Two experimental groups (Group A and Group B) and two control groups (Group C and Group D). **Silent Reading Speed Improvement:** - Group A and B experienced substantial increases in silent reading speed in the course (61 wpm and 51 wpm increase respectively from the first text to the last text). - Average silent reading speed outside the speed reading course increased by 48 wpm for the treatment groups and only 15 wpm for the control groups. **Oral Reading Speed Improvement:** - Modest improvements were made in oral reading rate, with the treatment groups improving by an average of around 8 spm and the control groups by only around 1-3 spm. - No substantial improvement in oral reading rates was observed among any of the groups. **Effect Size:** - Significant interactions suggest the gains from pre-test to post-test for the treatment groups were substantially greater than for the control groups (η² = .285 for silent reading speed improvement; η² = .126 for comprehension improvement). - An effect size of η² value is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger relationship. **Measures:** - Reading fluency was measured by the total number of words per minute (wpm) for silent reading and syllables per minute (spm) for oral reading. - Comprehension accuracy was measured by comprehension question scores before and after the treatment. - Reading materials were carefully vetted for vocabulary level and length to ensure consistency. **Other Important Data:** - Most participants were able to maintain or improve their comprehension accuracy while increasing reading speed. - Participants were aware that speed increases in the course were not being graded at university, possibly affecting their performance due to reduced pressure. **Conclusion:** - The speed reading course significantly improved silent reading fluency. - Oral reading fluency showed modest improvement, suggesting that gains in silent reading fluency do not necessarily equate to the same level of gains in oral reading fluency. The study demonstrates that while speed reading courses can effectively enhance silent reading fluency among EFL learners, this does not translate to significant improvement in oral reading rates. Additionally, this has pedagogical implications suggesting that there should be a balance between teaching receptive and productive skills in language learning programs."},{"prompt":"what was the reading speed of experimental groups (Group A and Group B) before and after course?","completion":"According to the study, the initial and final reading speeds of the experimental groups (Group A and Group B) before and after the speed reading course were as follows: **Group A:** - Initial Average Speed on the First Three Texts: 131.96 words per minute (wpm) - Final Average Speed on the Last Three Texts: 188.90 wpm **Group B:** - Initial Average Speed on the First Three Texts: 132.36 wpm - Final Average Speed on the Last Three Texts: 183.36 wpm These figures demonstrate that both Group A and Group B made substantial improvements in their silent reading speeds over the course of the two-month speed reading program.

Помоги придумать вымышленный топоним для великой империи, это должно отражать культуру Ганы и Болгарии.","completion":"Создание вымышленного топонима, который сочетает элементы культур двух разных стран, может быть весьма увлекательным процессом. Имена часто состоят из морфем, отражающих исторические, культурные или географические характеристики. Для слияния элементов Ганы и Болгарии можно использовать их языковые особенности, исторические эпохи, знаменитых личностей или символичные слова. Вот пример топонима на основе переплетения двух культур: **Ашантирадия Империя** Пояснение: - \\"Ашанти\\" - народ и историческое королевство, которое существовало на территории современной Ганы, известное своей мощью и культурой. - \\"радия\\" происходит от болгарского слова \\"радость\\" или \\"радий\\" (светящийся, успешный). - \\"Империя\\" добавляется для усиления статуса и мощи. Таким образом, \\"Ашантирадия Империя\\" могла бы символизировать мощное государство, которое сочетает в себе культурную выдающуюся особенность и величие народа Ашанти и радость или сияние Болгарии. Примеры других элементов, которые можно использовать для создания вымышленных топонимов: - Из Ганы: \\"Акан\\", \\"Кенте\\", \\"Адвинкра\\", \\"Анансе\\" (культурные и исторические символы). - Из Болгарии: \\"Роза\\" (Болгария известна культивацией роз), \\"Тракия\\" (исторический регион), \\"Лев\\" (символ Болгарии). Если топоним требуется для более специфического региона империи (например, столица, регион или город), можно соответствующим образом адаптировать имя, добавив качества, отражающие его положение или характеристику (например, \\"Солнечный\\", \\"Просвещенный\\", \\"Вечный\\" и т.д.)."},{"prompt":"Помоги придумать вымышленный топоним для группы сопротивления (восстали против этой империи), это должно отражать культуру Швеции и Англии.","completion":"Для создания топонима группы сопротивления, отражающего культуры Швеции и Англии, можно совместить элементы из истории, мифологии или языка обоих народов. Часто такие названия содержат намеки на силу, свободу, единство или справедливость. Вот возможный топоним для группы сопротивления: **Фридварг Легион** Пояснение: - \\"Фрид\\" происходит от шведского слова \\"fred\\", что означает \\"мир\\" или \\"свобода\\". Это популярная основа для имен в скандинавских странах и может также отражать желание мира и свободы сопротивления. - \\"Варг\\" в староскандинавском контексте может означать \\"волк\\" - животное, ассоциирующееся со свободной природой и отвагой. - \\"Легион\\" взят из латинского и английского языков, подразумевает организованный отряд войск, что отображает упорядоченность и решимость в борьбе. Такое имя может передавать как воинственность и храбрость (волк), так и миролюбивую цель (свобода) этой группы. Если желается добавить больше специфических английских элементов, можно использовать такие слова, как \\"Rose\\" (роза) для символизации красоты и надежды, или \\"Oak\\" (дуб) для отражения силы и устойчивости. Или же можно обратиться к англосаксонским словообразовательным элементам, таким как \\"leof\\" (любимый, ценный) или \\"cyning\\" (король), что может отразить уважение к личной свободе и лидерам сопротивления. Например, \\"Leofcyning Братство\\" или \\"Roseoak Альянс\\" могли бы также подойти для обозначения группы сопротивления, объединяя элементы обеих культур."},{"prompt":"Помоги придумать вымышленный топоним для человеческой утопии, где заправляют роботы, это должно отражать культуру Греции и Португалии.","completion":"Создание топонима для утопического общества, управляемого роботами, с учетом культурных особенностей Греции и Португалии, предполагает совмещение элементов истории, технологий и морских аспектов (учитывая портовое значение Португалии). Мы можем использовать слова, связанные с инновациями, гармонией и морскими мотивами, а также соотнести их с мифологией и языком обеих культур. Вот пример возможного топонима: **Атлантид Элисиум** Пояснение: - \\"Атлантид\\" напоминает о Атлантиде — затерянном мифическом острове, упоминаемом в диалогах Платона, который зачастую ассоциируется с утопическим обществом. Также это слово может намекать на Атлантический океан, который тесно связан с португальскими мореходными традициями. - \\"Элисиум\\" в греческой мифологии — это райские полевые районы, где герои наслаждаются идиллической жизнью после смерти, символизирующие счастье и утопию. Так, \\"Атлантид Элисиум\\" представляет собой сочетание технологического прогресса, мифологии и океанской открытости, образуя название утопии, где роботы обеспечивают высокий уровень жизни и гармонии среди жителей. Другие элементы, которые можно включить в топоним утопии: - Из греческой культуры: слова, связанные с идеалами гармонии и демократии, например, \\"Агора\\" (площадь, место сбора граждан) или \\"София\\" (мудрость). - Из португальской культуры: термины, отражающие путешествия и открытия, такие как \\"Навигадор\\" (мореплаватель) или \\"Инфанте\\" (используется в контексте \\"принц морей\\", что относится к Энрике Мореплавателю). Совмещение этих элементов может привести к таким названиям, как \\"София Навигадор\\", \\"Агора Инфанте\\", или с использованием португальского слова \\"утопия\\" (\\"Utopia\\") для ясности сообщения: \\"Навигадория Утопия\\"."},{"prompt":"Write 10 tweets about today’s coastline like frozen winter wonderland","completion":"1.

Here are steps to help you create a data model in CDF: 1. **Understand your domain**: Begin by understanding the physical layout and operations of the systems you wish to model. This could be a factory floor, a building's infrastructure, or an energy grid, for example. 2. **Identify key entities and relationships**: Determine the primary entities you will model as CDF Assets. Think about how these entities relate to one another. Will you have parent-child relationships? Are there many-to-many relationships? Also, consider which entities will be associated with time series data, events, or files. 3. **Define Asset Hierarchies**: Establish a hierarchy that represents the real-world structure of your operations. Assets can represent physical items (like machinery), logical groupings (such as a production line), or geographical locations (like a site or region). Parent-child relationships in the hierarchy can represent physical containment, logical groupings, or geographical associations. 4. **Map out your Data Objects**: - **Assets**: Represent physical or logical objects. Use a standardized naming convention and include metadata that is relevant for analytics or operational context. - **Time Series**: These represent measurements over time. Connect these with assets whenever applicable. Define the granularity, units, and frequency. - **Events**: These can represent anything that happens over a period of time or at a specific point in time, such as maintenance work or incidents. Attach them to relevant assets. - **Files**: Can be used for documents, images, or other files related to your entities. Make sure these, too, are associated with the correct assets. 5. **Design Custom Data Types**: If necessary, you can create custom data types in CDF to represent specific types of data that don't fit into the standard categories. 6. **Implement the Data Model**: In CDF, use the available APIs to programmatically: - Create and manage assets using the Assets API. - Post time series data using the Time Series API. - Log and manage events using the Events API. - Upload and manage files using the Files API. 7. **Validation and Testing**: Once your data model is in place, you'll want to validate it by ingesting some data and verifying whether everything behaves as expected. Check if hierarchies make sense, if asset properties are populated correctly, and if time series and events are tied to the correct assets. 8. **Iterate based on Feedback**: A data model is never perfect on the first try. You will need to iterate and refine the model based on feedback from end-users and as you understand your data and use cases better. Note that the ability to create complex data models and the specific methodologies will depend on the version of CDF you're using, and if you've got specific features enabled on your instance of CDF. Familiarize yourself with the latest developer documentation to understand the full capabilities and limitations of the platform. Remember, the CDF platform might have specific limits on the number of API calls, data structures, and other platform-specific details which you'll need to consider when designing your data model. Refer to Cognite's official documentation or reach out to their support for the most up-to-date information and guidance."},{"prompt":"help me creating a Data model in CDF with the following information-","completion":"It seems like you were about to provide details about the information you want to model in CDF but didn't include it in your message. To help you create a data model in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF), please provide the details of the information or the specifics of your domain and how you want it structured. This information would typically include: - Types of assets and their hierarchical structure (if any) - The relationship between different assets - Types of time series data you want to track and which assets they relate to - Events you want to capture and their relevance to specific assets - The structure and types of files (like images, manuals, technical sheets) and their associations with assets - Any other context or relationships that are significant for your model, such as locations, personnel, or external systems Once you provide the details, I can give you a more precise and targeted guide on how to create your data model in CDF.

Based on your brief, here's a high-level outline for creating such a model: # 1. Identify EHS Elements: The first step is to break down the components of EHS within your pharmaceutical environment. Examples could include: - **Environmental**: Emission tracking equipment, waste disposal units, wastewater treatment facilities, chemical storage areas, etc. - **Health**: Medical equipment, lab safety devices, personal protective equipment (PPE) inventory, examination rooms, etc. - **Safety**: Fire safety systems (fire alarms, extinguishers), emergency shut-off systems, safety sensors, CCTV, and evacuation routes. # 2. Define Asset Hierarchy: Organize these elements into a logical hierarchy. For instance: - **Site** - **Building/Plant** - **Department** (e.g., Research Lab, Production Floor, Packaging Area) - **System** (e.g., HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing) - **Equipment** (e.g., Fume Hood, Bioreactor, Pill Press) - **Safety Equipment** (e.g., Eyewash Station, Fire Extinguisher) # 3. Create Relationships: - **Parent-Child Relationships**: Define equipment and systems within their respective departments and buildings. - **Association Relationships**: Connect personnel qualifications or safety training records to relevant departments or job roles. # 4. Time Series Data: Identify time series data relevant to the EHS aspects like emission levels, waste disposal rates, or safety system activations. # 5. Events: EHS-related events could include safety drills, equipment maintenance, incident reports, safety inspections, etc. These should be tied to the relevant assets (i.e., equipment, location). # 6. Files: Attach files such as safety data sheets, EHS policies, training manuals, and inspection reports to the relevant assets or asset levels for documentation purposes. # 7. Define Metadata: For every asset, define metadata that could include manufacturer information, installation date, last maintenance date, responsible personnel, etc. # Implement the Data Model in CDF: Using the CDF API, you could create your model like this: \`\`\`python from cognite.client import CogniteClient client = CogniteClient(api_key=\\"YOUR_API_KEY\\", project=\\"YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\\", client_name=\\"YOUR_CLIENT_NAME\\") # Create assets (potentially as a batch creation for efficiency) main_site_asset = client.assets.create(Asset(name=\\"Main Pharma Site\\")) building_asset = client.assets.create(Asset(name=\\"Building 1\\", parent_id=main_site_asset.id)) lab_asset = client.assets.create(Asset(name=\\"Research Lab\\", parent_id=building_asset.id)) fume_hood_asset = client.assets.create(Asset(name=\\"Fume Hood XYZ\\", parent_id=lab_asset.id)) # Add time series data (also potentially as a batch creation) emission_ts = client.time_series.create(TimeSeries(name=\\"Emission Tracking\\", asset_id=fume_hood_asset.id)) # Log events (batch as well) safety_drill_event = client.events.create(Event(description=\\"Monthly Safety Drill\\", asset_ids=[lab_asset.id], start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time)) # Upload files and associate with assets safety_manual_file = client.files.upload(\\"safety_manual.pdf\\", name=\\"Safety Manual\\", asset_ids=[main_site_asset.id]) \`\`\` Please replace \`\\"YOUR_API_KEY\\"\`, \`\\"YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\\"\`, and \`\\"YOUR_CLIENT_NAME\\"\` with your actual Cognite credentials and project details. The provided Python code is a simplified example of how you might interact with the CDF API. # Validation, Testing, and Iteration: After you've created the initial data model, you need to test and validate it. Inspect the CDF visualizations to ensure assets are appropriately related, and relevant data is correctly tied to them. Additionally, consult with EHS domain experts to refine the model as needed. Your data model will evolve over time as you gather feedback and as operational changes occur. EHS in the pharmaceutical industry is complex and highly regulated, so expect periodic model updates to comply with changing regulations and operational best practices. Remember to also take advantage of any domain-specific functionality provided by CDF, such as data transformation and contextualization features, that can help tie together different data types meaningfully."},{"prompt":"in cdf data model editor give me an example data model using GraphQL","completion":"Sure, Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) provides a GraphQL API interface that allows you to create and interact with your data model. Unfortunately, as of my knowledge cut-off in early 2023, there’s no direct method to create or modify assets, events, or time series using GraphQL mutations in CDF as Cognite primarily uses GraphQL for querying the data models rather than defining or altering them. Nonetheless, to give you an idea of how to query an existing data model in CDF using GraphQL, I'll provide you with an example. You would typically use the GraphQL API to explore asset hierarchies, retrieve time series data related to assets, or fetch events. Here is how you might query for assets and their related time series and events: \`\`\`graphql # Example GraphQL query to retrieve asset information along with related time series and events query { assetList(rootExternalIds: [\\"main_site_asset\\"], depth: 2) { items { externalId name parentExternalId description metadata { key value } timeSeries(limit: 5) { items { externalId name metadata { key value } } } events(limit: 5) { items { externalId startTime endTime type subtype description } } } } } \`\`\` In this example, we're requesting asset information for the asset with the external id \`main_site_asset\` and exploring two levels down the asset hierarchy (\`depth: 2\`). We further request the first five time series and events related to those assets (\`limit: 5\`). The returned data includes identifiers, names, metadata for assets, and some basic details about related time series and events. To be able to execute this query, you would perform it against the CDF project's GraphQL endpoint through an HTTP POST request with proper authentication (usually an API key or OAuth token). Please note that if you must create or update assets, events, or time series, you would need to use the REST API provided by Cognite or SDKs, not GraphQL. Modification operations are typically performed via POST, PUT, or DELETE HTTP methods using the Cognite REST API endpoints or by calling appropriate methods in the SDK (Python, JS, etc.). The above query assumes you already have a defined data model. If you’re looking to create one, you would need to use the CDF RAW API or other relevant Cognite Data Fusion APIs (or SDKs) to define your assets, events, time series, and files initially. Remember that the exact syntax or capabilities may change as the Cognite Data Fusion platform evolves, so you should always refer to the latest CDF documentation for up-to-date information."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"does mutually exclusive means dependent?","completion":"No, \\"mutually exclusive\\" and \\"dependent\\" are two different concepts, usually referring to events in probability and statistics. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. If one event occurs, the other cannot occur within the same experiment or scenario. For instance, when flipping a coin, the events \\"heads\\" and \\"tails\\" are mutually exclusive because both outcomes cannot happen simultaneously in a single coin flip. Dependent events, on the other hand, have outcomes that are not independent of each other; the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other event. For example, if you draw a card from a deck and do not replace it, then the probability of drawing a second specific card has changed due to the result of the first draw. The events are dependent because the outcome of the first draw affects the outcome of the second. So, mutually exclusive refers to the impossibility of events happening together, and dependent refers to a relationship where one event influences the likelihood of another. It's important to note that mutually exclusive events are, by nature, dependent because the occurrence of one event changes the probability of the other event occurring to zero. However, dependent events are not necessarily mutually exclusive. They may have an influence on each other's probability of occurrence without completely ruling each other out."},{"prompt":"translate to english","completion":"It seems like you've intended to provide a text for translation but didn't include it in your request.

― 이택현 선수라면 충분히 골을 넣을 수 있는 거리죠! 해설들이 기대감을 드러내며 소리쳤지만, 슈팅 타이밍은 나오지 않았다. 알제리의 수비수 2명이 각을 좁히며 괜찮은 수비를 펼쳤기 때문이었다. 그러나 이때. 툭! 이택현은 수비수들의 키를 넘기는 로빙패스를 시도했다. 침투하는 신재욱을 노린 킬패스였다. ― 우오오오! 패스입니다! 신재욱! 공을 받나요?! 포물선을 그리며 날아오는 공. 신재욱은 그 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. 슈팅하기에 좋은 자세는 아니었지만, 지금이 최고의 타이밍이었다. 조금이라도 시간을 끌면 튀어나오는 골키퍼에게 방해받거나 근처에 있는 수비수에게 막힐 수 있으니까. ‘지금 슈팅하는 게 나아.’ 공중에 있는 공을 때려내는 슈팅이었다. 당연히 좋은 슈팅을 때려내기엔 더욱 어렵다. 그랬음에도 신재욱은 어렵게 생각하지 않았다. 그에겐 더 어려운 슈팅도 성공시켰던 경험이 많았으니까. 퍼엉! 발등과 공이 만나며 듣기 좋은 타격음이 터졌다. 잘못 맞으면 공이 하늘로 붕 뜰 수도 있지만, 신재욱의 슈팅은 그렇지 않았다. 높게 뜨지 않고 낮게 깔린 채로 쏘아졌다. “헉!” 알제리의 골키퍼 라이스 므볼리의 눈이 커졌다. 몸을 날려보려 했지만, 그러지 못했다. 공이 이미 골대 안으로 들어오고 있었으니까. ― 골! 골입니다! 역시 신재욱! 골키퍼가 움직이지도 못할 정도로 강력한 발리슛으로 골을 터트렸습니다! 신재욱의 표정엔 변화가 없었다. 어시스트를 해준 이택현에게 엄지를 들어 올렸지만, 그걸로 끝이었다. 시간이 아까웠기에 곧바로 공을 들고 경기장 중앙으로 달렸다. ― 완벽한 마무리였습니다! 신재욱 선수는 지금처럼 기회가 오면 바로 골을 넣어주는 선수죠! ― 신재욱 선수가 세리머니를 생략하네요! 지난 러시아전에서도 이런 모습을 몇 번이나 보여줬었죠! 이렇게 신재욱 선수가 세리머니를 생략하는 이유는 이미 인터뷰에서 밝힌 적이 있죠? ― 그렇습니다. 더 많은 골을 넣고 싶어서라고 말했었죠. 멋진 이유입니다! ― 러시아전에서 무려 4골을 넣었던 신재욱 선수가 알제리전에서도 시동을 걸었습니다! 한국의 분위기가 살아나기 시작했다. 양쪽 윙어로 나온 이청영과 손훈민이 부진한 모습을 보여주고 있지만, 그럴 때마다 이택현이 측면으로 빠져서 크랙 역할을 소화해줬다. ― 이택현 선수! 드리블이 정말 위협적이네요! 알제리 선수들에게 둘러싸인 상황에서도 기어코 돌파를 해내네요! 신재욱도 활발하게 움직였다. 손훈민, 이택현과 자리를 바꿔가며 알제리 수비수들의 머릿속을 복잡하게 만들었고, 계속해서 밑으로 내려오며 중원 싸움에 힘을 실어줬다. 그러자 알제리는 전처럼 한국을 압도하지 못했다. ― 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수가 경기의 흐름을 바꿔놓고 있습니다! 놀랍네요! 팀에서 가장 어린 두 명의 선수가 이렇게까지 큰 영향력을 보여주다니요! ― 이택현 선수의 돌파가 너무 무서우니까, 알제리 선수들이 라인을 쉽게 올리지 못하고 있죠? 그리고 신재욱 선수는 정말 실수가 없네요. 정확하게 공을 받고, 뿌려주는데, 또 공은 절대 뺏기질 않습니다. 원톱 스트라이커가 이런 역할까지 해주면 동료들은 너무 편해지죠! 낮았던 한국의 볼 점유율도 조금씩 높아졌다. ― 신재욱이 공을 받습니다! 한 명을 가볍게 제쳐내는 신재욱! 최근 월드클래스에 올랐다고 평가받게 된 신재욱은 확실한 클래스를 보여줬다. 공을 가졌을 때와 가지지 않았을 때 모두 강력한 모습을 보여주는 선수답게 모든 상황에서 알제리를 위협했다. 게다가 이택현은 그런 신재욱을 철저하게 보조해줬다. ― 이택현 선수와 2 대 1 패스를 주고받으며 침투하는 신재욱 선수입니다! ― 두 선수의 호흡은 대표팀에서도 여전하네요! 바이에른 뮌헨에서 보여주던 그 모습이죠! 알제리의 수비진을 너무나도 쉽게 흔들고 있습니다! 깊게 침투한 신재욱은 슈팅을 때릴 것처럼 다리를 짧게 휘둘렀다. 반 박자 빠른 타이밍의 슈팅. 다만 알제리의 수비수들은 이런 신재욱의 슈팅 스타일을 이미 연구해왔다. 그래서 빠르게 반응했다. 그러나 슈팅은 속임수였다. 신재욱은 알제리의 수비수가 발을 뻗는 타이밍에 맞춰서 옆으로 이동했다. 수비수는 발을 뻗는 바람에 더는 신재욱의 움직임을 따라가지 못했다. 퍼엉! 왼발로 정확하게 때려낸 슈팅이었다. 날카롭게 휘어진 공은 알제리의 골대 구석으로 파고들었다. ― 동점 골입니다! 신재욱 선수가 기어코 동점 골을 만들어냈습니다! 수비수를 앞에 둔 상황에서도 침착하게 공을 컨트롤하며 정확한 슈팅을 때려내네요! 역시 월드클래스답습니다! 경기장의 분위기가 완전히 변했다. 알제리 선수들은 당혹감을 드러냈다. 신재욱과 이택현의 실력이 뛰어나다는 건 알고 있었지만, 실제로 상대하니 이들이 생각했던 것보다도 더 어려운 상대였다. ‘너무 잘하잖아…? 어떻게 막아야 하지?’ ‘신재욱 하나로도 힘든데, 이택현까지 이렇게 잘하면…….’ ‘이택현이랑 신재욱은 드리블을 왜 저렇게 잘하는 거야? 마음먹고 드리블하니까 반칙하지 않고서는 막을 수가 없는데…?’ ‘위험해…… 신재욱이 골 맛을 보기 시작했어……!’ 반면 한국 대표팀 선수들의 마음속엔 이길 수 있다는 자신감이 생겼다. ‘알제리도 이길 수 있겠는데?’ ‘재욱이랑 택현이가 완전 잘해주고 있어. 점수도 벌써 동점이 됐고. 이러면 충분히 할만하지!’ ‘흐흐! 16강 가는 건가?’ ‘죽기 살기로 뛰어서 1인분만 하자. 그러면 이길 것 같아.’ * * 신재욱과 이택현이 마음먹고 공격에 집중하자, 알제리의 수비는 비상이었다. 이들은 신재욱과 이택현에게만 집중할 수밖에 없었다. 그렇게 해도 막기가 힘들었으니까. 그러자 자연스레 다른 한국 선수들에게 기회가 생겼다. ― 손훈민! 슈팅! 우와아아아! 들어갔습니다! 손훈민 선수도 슈팅력이 굉장한 선수죠! 분데스리가에서도 인정받고 있는 슈터이지 않습니까? ― 이건 알제리가 너무 손훈민 선수를 편하게 놔뒀네요! 신재욱 선수랑 이택현 선수를 막는 데에만 집중한 것 같네요! 알제리의 수비수들은 머릿속이 더 복잡해질 것 같습니다! 신재욱 선수와 이택현 선수를 계속 막자니, 지금처럼 손훈민 선수가 편해질 수밖에 없는데 그러면 또 위험해지거든요! 손훈민의 골이었다. 페널티박스 바로 바깥 지역에서 때려낸 슈팅이 그대로 골로 연결된 것이었다. ― 스코어는 3 대 2가 됐습니다! 2 대 0이었던 스코어를 3 대 2로 역전한 한국! 너무나도 대단합니다! ― 경기 재밌네요! 전반전에만 5골이 나왔습니다! 손훈민에게 골을 허용했지만, 알제리는 여전히 신재욱과 이택현을 향한 경계를 풀지 못했다. 그만큼 두 선수가 보여준 실력은 알제리 선수들의 머릿속에 강렬하게 각인됐다. 그러자 계속해서 손훈민과 이청영에게 기회가 생겼고, 후반전부터는 더욱 좋은 기회가 생겼다. ― 손훈민 크로스! 크로스가 조금 긴데요? 오! 이청영 선수를 본 거군요! 이청영 슈우우웃! 아! 아쉽습니다! 이청영 선수의 슈팅이 빗맞았네요! 잠시 후, 뒤에 서 있던 기석용에게도 좋은 슈팅 기회가 생겼다. 기석용은 대표팀 내에서 슈팅력으로는 세 손가락 안에 꼽히는 선수답게 망설임 없이 중거리 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼어엉! 발에 제대로 걸린 슈팅이었다. 더군다나 슈팅을 때린 선수가 기석용이었다. 슈팅 능력만큼은 유럽에서도 인정받는 선수답게, 공에 실린 힘은 굉장했다. 그러나 알제리 골키퍼의 집중력도 상당했다. 기석용의 슈팅 타이밍을 읽은 그는 빠르게 몸을 날렸다. 190cm가 넘는 알제리의 골키퍼 라이스 므볼리. 그는 기어코 손끝으로 기석용이 때려낸 공을 건드리는 것에 성공했다. 투욱! 강렬하게 쏘아지던 공은 급격히 힘을 잃었다. 라이스 므볼리 골키퍼는 손끝에 맞고 튕긴 공을 향해 움직였다. 한국의 선수가 공을 건드리기 전에 빨리 공을 잡아 지켜내야만 했다. 그러나 한 번 몸을 날린 상태였기에, 공을 잡으러 가는 속도가 빠를 수는 없었다. 그리고 그 순간. 전 세계에서 가장 좋은 위치선정 능력을 지닌 선수가 기다렸다는 듯 공을 향해 달려들었다. 툭! 알제리의 골키퍼가 공을 잡기 직전. 신재욱의 발끝이 공을 툭― 찍어 차올렸다. 골키퍼의 손이 닿지 않을 정도의 높이로만 가볍게 띄워 찬 슈팅이었다. 그 공은 알제리 선수들이 지켜보는 가운데, 골대 안으로 날아 들어갔다. ― 고오오오오오오올! 이번에도 신재욱 선수입니다! 지금 몇 골째인가요? 세, 세 번째 골입니다! 해트트릭입니다! ― 알제리를 상대로 해트트릭을 기록하는 신재욱! 기가 막힌 위치선정 능력을 보여주며 추가 골을 터트렸습니다! 이제 스코어는 4 대 2가 됐습니다! 대한민국이 러시아에 이어서 알제리까지 무너뜨리고 있습니다! 그 중심엔 신재욱이라는 천재가 당당히 서 있네요! 경기장이 달아올랐다. 한국 선수들은 미친 듯 흥분하며 소리를 질러댔다. 신재욱은 평소처럼 공을 들고 경기장 중앙으로 향하려고 했지만, 동료들이 둘러싸는 바람에 그러지 못했다. 관중들의 반응도 대단했다. 우와아아아아아아! 브라질에서 펼쳐지는 월드컵인 만큼 한국인뿐만 아니라 브라질인들도 경기장에 많았는데, 이들도 신재욱의 실력을 인정하며 뜨거운 함성을 질러댔다. “으어어어어! 고오오오오오올! 재욱아! 됐다! 네 덕에 됐어! 우리 16강 갈 수 있다고!” “네가 오늘도 해냈어! 재욱아! 넌 내가 정말 형으로 모신다!” “어떻게 딱 골키퍼가 튕겨낸 곳에 딱 서 있냐? 재욱이를 보면 위치선정이 그냥 인자기가 따로 없다니까?” “내가 볼 땐 인자기보다 위치선정 능력이 더 좋은 것 같아.” 기뻐하는 동료들을 보며, 신재욱도 미소를 지었다. 들고 있던 공도 내려놨다. 자신보다 더 기뻐해 주는 동료들과 시간을 보내고 싶어졌다. 그리고 그때. 신재욱의 미소는 더욱 짙어졌다. [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] 허공에 떠오른 메시지들 때문이었다. ‘월드컵답네.’ 대단한 성장 속도였다. 이미 해트트릭을 했지만, 더 많은 골을 원하게 될 정도로. ‘아무래도 오늘 욕심 좀 더 내야겠는데?’ 그래서 신재욱은 다짐했다. 할 수 있는 한, 최선을 다해서 많은 골을 넣겠다고. 알제리 선수들이 충격받을만한 스코어를 만들어주겠다고. ‘미안하지만 내 성장이 우선이라서.’","completion":"189 * * Lee Taek-hyun made his move. It was a different look from the altruistic play he had shown so far. - Player Lee Taek-hyun! He boldly advances! Oh! Lee Taek-hyun! That's a good dribble! He completely stole the timing from the defender! Lee Taek-hyun, who had been on the flank, boldly attempted a breakthrough and succeeded. Then he dribbled deeper and advanced further. It was a good movement that drew out the defenders. The Algerian defenders had no choice but to react. They knew that Lee Taek-hyun not only had good dribbling skills but also possessed the ability to shoot well with both feet. - Player Lee Taek-hyun! Is he going to shoot? - If it's player Lee Taek-hyun, he can definitely score from that distance! The commentators shouted with anticipation, but the timing for a shot did not come. Two Algerian defenders closed the angle and put up a decent defense. But then. Tuk! Lee Taek-hyun attempted a lobbing pass over the defenders' heads. It was a killer pass aimed at Shin Jae-wook, who was making a run. - Wow! It's a pass! Shin Jae-wook! Does he receive the ball?! The ball flew in a parabola. Shin Jae-wook swung his leg at it. It wasn't the best posture for shooting, but it was the best timing. If he delayed even a little, he could be obstructed by the goalkeeper rushing out or blocked by a nearby defender. 'It's better to shoot now.' It was a shot while the ball was in the air. Naturally, it was even more difficult to make a good shot. Nevertheless, Shin Jae-wook didn't find it difficult. He had plenty of experience in making even more difficult shots. Puhreung! The sound of the ball being struck by the instep was satisfying to hear. If hit incorrectly, the ball could have soared into the sky, but Shin Jae-wook's shot did not. It was shot low and flat. \\"Huh!\\" Algerian goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi's eyes widened. He tried to throw himself at it, but he couldn't. The ball was already entering the goal. - Goal! It's a goal! As expected of Shin Jae-wook! A powerful volley shot that the goalkeeper couldn't even move to stop! Shin Jae-wook's expression did not change. He gave a thumbs-up to Lee Taek-hyun, who had assisted, but that was it. He didn't want to waste time, so he immediately picked up the ball and ran to the center of the field. - It was a perfect finish! Player Shin Jae-wook is the kind of player who immediately scores when given the chance! - Player Shin Jae-wook is skipping the celebration! We've seen this several times in the last match against Russia! The reason why Shin Jae-wook skips celebrations has already been mentioned in an interview, right? - That's right. He said he wants to score more goals. That's a cool reason! - Player Shin Jae-wook, who scored four goals in the match against Russia, has started to get going against Algeria too! The atmosphere in the Korean team began to come alive. Even though the wingers Lee Chung-yong and Son Heung-min were showing a lackluster performance, Lee Taek-hyun would move to the flank and play the role of a crack whenever necessary. - Player Lee Taek-hyun! His dribbling is really threatening! Even surrounded by Algerian players, he manages to break through! Shin Jae-wook also moved actively. He switched places with Son Heung-min and Lee Taek-hyun, confusing the Algerian defenders, and continued to drop back to add strength to the midfield battle. Then Algeria could no longer dominate Korea as before. - Players Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun are changing the flow of the game! It's amazing! The two youngest players on the team are showing such a huge influence! - Because Lee Taek-hyun's breakthroughs are so scary, the Algerian players can't easily push up their line, right? And Shin Jae-wook is really making no mistakes. He receives the ball accurately, distributes it, and never loses it. When a lone striker can do this role too, it makes it much easier for his teammates! Korea's ball possession, which had been low, started to increase. - Shin Jae-wook receives the ball! He easily gets past one player! Shin Jae-wook, who has recently been considered a world-class player, showed his class. Whether he had the ball or not, he threatened Algeria in every situation as a player who shows strong performance in all conditions. Moreover, Lee Taek-hyun thoroughly supported such a Shin Jae-wook. - Shin Jae-wook penetrates as he exchanges a 2-on-1 pass with player Lee Taek-hyun! - The chemistry between the two players is still evident in the national team! That's the performance they showed at Bayern Munich! They are shaking the Algerian defense too easily! Shin Jae-wook, who had penetrated deeply, swung his leg as if to shoot. A half-beat faster shooting timing. However, the Algerian defenders had already studied Shin Jae-wook's shooting style. So they reacted quickly. But the shot was a feint. Shin Jae-wook moved to the side just as the Algerian defender stretched out his leg. The defender, having extended his leg, could no longer follow Shin Jae-wook's movement. Puhreung! It was a precise shot with his left foot. The sharply curved ball drilled into the corner of the Algerian goal. - It's an equalizing goal! Player Shin Jae-wook has managed to score the equalizer! Even with a defender in front, he calmly controlled the ball and made an accurate shot! Truly world-class! The atmosphere in the stadium completely changed. The Algerian players showed their dismay. They knew that Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun were excellent players, but facing them in reality, they were even more difficult opponents than they had thought. 'They're too good... How do we stop them?' 'It's tough enough with just Shin Jae-wook, but if Lee Taek-hyun is this good too...' 'Why are Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun so good at dribbling? When they decide to dribble, it's impossible to stop them without fouling...' 'It's dangerous... Shin Jae-wook has started to taste goals...!' On the other hand, the Korean national team players felt a confidence that they could win. 'We can beat Algeria, right?' 'Jae-wook and Taek-hyun are doing so well. We're already tied. We can definitely do this!' 'Hehe! Are we going to the round of 16?' 'Let's play with a do-or-die attitude and do our part. Then we'll win.' * * When Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun focused on attacking, the Algerian defense was in emergency mode. They had no choice but to concentrate only on Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun. Even that was difficult to stop. Naturally, this created opportunities for other Korean players. - Son Heung-min! Shooting! Wow! It's in! Player Son Heung-min also has tremendous shooting power! Isn't he a recognized shooter in the Bundesliga? - Algeria let Son Heung-min too comfortable! It seems they were only focused on stopping players Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun! The Algerian defenders' heads must be getting more complicated! If they keep trying to stop Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun, like now, Son Heung-min will be comfortable, and that's dangerous! It was Son Heung-min's goal. A shot from just outside the penalty box connected directly to a goal. - The score is now 3 to 2! Korea has turned the score from 2 to 0 to 3 to 2! This is truly amazing! - The game is exciting! Five goals have been scored just in the first half! Even after conceding a goal to Son Heung-min, Algeria still couldn't let their guard down against Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun. The skills shown by the two players were strongly imprinted in the minds of the Algerian players. As a result, opportunities kept arising for Son Heung-min and Lee Chung-yong, and even better chances came in the second half. - Son Heung-min crosses! The cross is a bit long, isn't it? Oh! He saw player Lee Chung-yong! Lee Chung-yong shoots! Ah! It's a pity! Player Lee Chung-yong's shot went off target! Shortly after, Ki Sung-yueng also had a good shooting opportunity. As one of the top three shooters in the national team, Ki Sung-yueng did not hesitate to take a long-range shot. Puhreung! It was a well-struck shot. Moreover, the shooter was Ki Sung-yueng. As a player recognized for his shooting ability even in Europe, the power behind the ball was tremendous. However, the concentration of the Algerian goalkeeper was also significant. Reading Ki Sung-yueng's shooting timing, he quickly threw himself at it. The Algerian goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi, who is over 190cm tall. He managed to touch the ball shot by Ki Sung-yueng with the tips of his fingers. Tuk! The ball, which had been shot powerfully, suddenly lost its force. Goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi moved towards the ball, which had been deflected by his fingertips. He had to quickly catch the ball before a Korean player touched it. However, having already thrown himself once, he couldn't move quickly to catch the ball. And at that moment. One of the players with the best positioning in the world rushed towards the ball as if he had been waiting. Tuk! Just before the Algerian goalkeeper could catch the ball. Shin Jae-wook's toe lightly flicked the ball upwards. It was a shot that lightly lifted the ball just high enough to be out of the goalkeeper's reach. The ball flew into the goal, watched by the Algerian players. - Goal! It's Shin Jae-wook again! How many goals is that now? Three, it's the third goal! It's a hat-trick! - Shin Jae-wook scores a hat-trick against Algeria! He shows off his incredible positioning ability and scores an additional goal! Now the score is 4 to 2! South Korea is bringing down Algeria following Russia! And at the center of it all stands the genius, Shin Jae-wook! The stadium was ablaze. The Korean players were excitedly screaming. Shin Jae-wook, as usual, tried to head to the center of the field with the ball, but his teammates surrounded him, preventing him from doing so. The reaction of the crowd was also tremendous. Wow! Since the World Cup was being held in Brazil, not only Koreans but also Brazilians were present in large numbers at the stadium, and they too shouted hot cheers, acknowledging Shin Jae-wook's skills. \\"Ugh! Goal! Jae-wook! That's it! Thanks to you, we can make it! We can go to the round of 16!\\" \\"You did it again today, Jae-wook! I really respect you as a brother!\\" \\"How can you be exactly where the goalkeeper deflects it? When I look at Jae-wook, it's like positioning is just a natural talent!\\" \\"I think his positioning ability is even better than natural talent.\\" Watching his joyful teammates, Shin Jae-wook also smiled. He put down the ball he was holding. He wanted to spend time with his teammates who were happier for him than himself. And then. Shin Jae-wook's smile grew even wider. [Your Stamina has increased by 1!] [Your Agility has increased by 1!] It was because of the messages that appeared in the air. 'It's worthy of the World Cup.' It was an impressive rate of growth. Even though he had already scored a hat-trick, he wanted to score even more goals. 'Maybe I should be a bit more greedy today?' So Shin Jae-wook made a resolution. As much as possible, he would do his best to score many goals. He would give the Algerian players a shocking score. 'Sorry, but my growth comes first.'"},{"prompt":"191 * * * 홍정태 감독은 생각이 많아졌다. 훈련이 끝나자마자 그를 찾아온 신재욱이 한 말들 때문이었다. “더 높은 곳을 바라보려면 패배는 생각하지 않아야 한다고……?” 솔직히 자존심은 상했다. 그는 감독이고, 신재욱은 선수였으니까. 게다가 신재욱은 대표팀에서 가장 나이가 어린 막내 선수이지 않은가. 그러나 무시할 수는 없었다. 신재욱이 대표팀에 미치는 영향력은 대단했고, 선수로서도 그렇고 사람으로서도 인정할 수밖에 없을 정도로 모범적인 모습을 보여주고 있었으니까. “재욱이가 한 말도 틀린 말은 아니긴 해. 이왕이면 패배 없이 16강에 가는 게 팀 분위기에도 좋긴 하겠지.” 홍정태 감독은 신재욱의 말을 신중하게 곱씹었다. 그러나 긍정적인 생각보다는 부정적인 생각이 계속해서 머릿속에 떠올랐다. 감독이라는 자리는 늘 최악의 상황까지도 생각할 수밖에 없는 자리였기 때문이었다. “문제는 정말 벨기에를 이길 수 있겠냐는 건데…….” 벨기에를 이길 수 있다면야 좋다. 신재욱이 했던 말처럼 팀의 기세가 높아진 상태로 16강에 오를 수 있으니까. 하지만 전력을 다했음에도 패배하게 되면 많은 것을 잃게 된다. 주전 선수들의 체력은 체력대로 떨어지고, 자신감도 떨어질 수 있다. 홍정태 감독은 그 부분이 불안했다. 하지만 그는 결국 결정을 내렸다. “신재욱은 정말 벨기에를 이길 수 있다고 믿고 있었어.” 승리를 확신하는 선수의 눈빛. 그런 눈빛을 보고도 경기를 포기한다? 그건 감독의 자격이 없다는 생각이 들었다. “해보자! 똑같은 사람인데, 이길 수도 있는 거잖아?” 그렇게 소리치며, 홍정태 감독은 책상 위에 예쁘게 올려줬던 서류를 바라봤다. 자세히 볼 일이 없을 줄 알았던 벨기에와 관련된 자료들이었다. 다음 날. 하루아침에 한국 대표팀의 분위기가 바뀌었다. 여유롭게 훈련하던 분위기는 온데간데없이 사라졌다. “우리는 벨기에를 이기고 H조 1위로 올라간다.” 홍정태 감독이 내뱉은 말로 인해서 생긴 변화였다. 단순히 말뿐만이 아니라 감독은 훈련의 강도를 높였다. ‘크게 기대하진 않았었는데, 마음을 바꾸셨나 보네.’ 신재욱은 옅게 웃으며 홍정태 감독을 바라봤다. 하지만 그것도 잠시, 이내 표정을 굳히곤 집중력을 끌어올렸다. 그리고 그 누구보다도 치열하게 훈련에 임하기 시작했다. ‘그 선택, 후회하지 않게 해드릴게요.’ * * * 홍정태 감독과 한국 대표팀 선수들은 벨기에와의 경기를 앞두고 최선을 다했다. 벨기에의 전술을 분석하는 것은 물론이고, 그에 맞춘 훈련을 계속해서 반복했다. 선수들 모두 의욕적이었다. 이들 모두 말은 하진 않았지만, 전력으로 벨기에와 붙어보고 싶다는 마음을 갖고 있었기 때문이었다. 며칠이 지난 뒤. ― 선수들이 경기장에 입장합니다! 한국 대표팀 선수들은 벨기에와의 경기를 치르기 위해 경기장에 걸어들어왔다. ― 선수들의 표정에 긴장감이 흐르는데요? 두 팀 모두 2승을 거두며 16강행이 확정된 상태인데, H조 1위를 가리는 경기이기 때문일까요? ― 16강은 확정됐지만, 이번 경기는 자존심이 걸렸다고 할 수 있죠! 양 팀 모두 패배가 없는 팀이기에 오늘도 꼭 이기고 싶을 겁니다. 실제로 양 팀의 스쿼드를 보면 주전 선수들을 내보내지 않았습니까? 해설들의 말처럼 양 팀 모두 100% 주전 선수들을 내보냈다. 그리고 그 사실에 한국 축구팬들은 당혹감을 드러냈다. └ ????? 양 팀 선발 명단 발표됐을 때, 설마 했는데 진짜였네……? 뭐냐? 벨기에랑 풀 전력으로 맞짱 뜬다고……? 이거 맞아……? └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ홍정태 감독 왜 이래?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 뭔데 진짜ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진심으로 벨기에를 이길 생각인가? └ 아;;;; 오바 아닌가? 벨기에는 너무 센데? 그냥 이 경기는 대충 후보 선수들 내보내서 지고, 16강전에 올인하는 게 낫지 않나? └ 그게 낫지. 어차피 벨기에를 이길 가능성은 거의 없잖아. └ 신재욱, 이택현, 손훈민, 기석용이 있어서 웬만한 팀이랑은 할만하다고 말할 수 있지만……아…벨기에는 오바지. 괜히 주전 선수들 체력만 소모하는 경기가 될 듯. └ 물론 축구는 붙어보기 전까진 어떻게 될지 모르는 거긴 한데……벨기에는 좀……. └ 이번 벨기에 스쿼드 진짜 사기던데ㄷㄷㄷ 이걸 그냥 붙겠다고? 우리 스쿼드 보면 이긴다는 마인드 같은데ㄷㄷ 이번 2014 월드컵에 참여한 벨기에는 매우 강력한 전력을 지닌 팀으로 유명했다. 전 세계 축구팬들 사이에서 잘하면 우승까지도 노릴 수 있는 팀이라는 평가를 받을 정도였다. 실제로 H조에서 러시아와 알제리를 모두 꺾으며 강팀다운 면모를 제대로 보여줬다. 한국 축구팬들은 이 모든 사실을 알기에 당황했고, 걱정할 수밖에 없던 것이다. 같은 시각. 벨기에 대표팀 선수들의 얼굴엔 황당하다는 감정이 떠오르고 있었다. “한국 애들 눈빛 좀 봐. 정말 우릴 이길 생각인가 봐.” “허! 주제도 모르네. 몇 번 이겼다고, 현실을 파악하는 능력이 사라졌나 봐.” “설마 러시아나 알제리 같은 팀이랑 우릴 비슷한 수준으로 생각하는 건 아니겠지? 그렇다면 너무 멍청한 건데.” “큭큭! 너무 그러지 마. 지고 싶은 팀이 어디 있겠어? 쟤들도 이기고는 싶겠지. 물론 불가능한 꿈일 뿐이지만 말이야.” “하하하하! 한국 애들 눈빛 좀 봐. 쟤들 본인들이 프랑스나 이탈리아 같은 강팀인 줄 아는 거 아니야? 약팀 주제에 왜 저렇게 눈에 힘을 주지?” 벨기에 선수들은 한국 선수들의 비장한 표정을 보며 비웃음을 터트렸다. 그때였다. 벨기에의 중원을 책임지는 선수인 무사 뎀벨레가 입을 열었다. “다들 그만해. 그냥 경기력으로 찍어 눌러주면 되잖아. 그리고 방심하지는 마. 한국에도 엄청난 녀석들이 있는 거 알지?” 경고가 담긴 말. 그 말을 들은 벨기에 선수들은 신재욱과 이택현을 바라보며 고개를 끄덕였다. 이들 모두 한국을 무시하고 있긴 하지만, 신재욱과 이택현만큼은 인정하고 있었다. 가장 최근에 챔피언스리그에서 우승한 바이에른 뮌헨의 주전 선수들이니까. 특히 신재욱은 분데스리가에서 두 시즌 연속 득점왕을 차지하며, 월드클래스로 평가받는 선수였으니까. 잠시 후, 심판이 휘슬을 불었다. 삐이이익! ― 경기 시작합니다! 현재 월드컵에서 매우 좋은 모습을 보여주고 있는 대한민국과 벨기에가 드디어 맞붙습니다! 선공을 펼친 건 대한민국이었다. 이기겠다는 마음을 강하게 먹고 온 한국 대표팀 선수들은 자신감 있게 공격을 시도했다. 수비형 미드필더 김국영이 기석용에게 공을 넘겼고, 기석용은 전방에 있는 이택현에게 전진 패스를 뿌렸다. 툭! 이택현이 공을 잡은 뒤 바디페인팅을 쓰며 몸을 돌렸다. 이때, 무사 뎀벨레가 강하게 몸을 부딪쳐왔다. 동시에 피지컬이 엄청난 마루앙 펠라이니까지 덤벼들었다. “악!” 이택현이 쓰러졌다. 무사 뎀벨레의 차징은 버텨냈지만, 이어서 들어온 마루앙 펠라이니의 차징까지 버텨내는 건 무리였다. 좋은 체격을 지녔고, 웬만해선 밀리지 않는 피지컬을 지닌 이택현이었지만. 무사 뎀벨레와 마루앙 펠라이니는 유럽에서도 최고 수준의 피지컬을 지닌 선수들이었다. 다행인 것은 반칙이 선언됐다는 것이었다. ― 이택현 선수가 강하게 항의하네요. 하지만 카드가 주어지진 않았습니다. ― 이택현 선수가 공을 잡았을 때, 벨기에의 압박이 굉장히 강한데요? 반칙이 되더라도 이택현 선수의 플레이를 방해하겠다는 의도가 보입니다. ― 이번 월드컵에서 워낙 좋은 활약을 펼치고 있는 선수니까요. 신재욱 선수가 골을 넣어주는 역할이라면, 이택현 선수는 골을 넣을 수 있게 기회를 만들어주는 선수이지 않습니까? 벨기에는 이택현을 막으면 한국의 공격이 원활하지 않을 거라고 보는 것 같습니다. 한국의 프리킥 상황. 골대와의 거리는 40m 정도로 멀었지만, 기석용이라는 좋은 키커를 지닌 한국이었기에 이 정도면 충분히 좋은 기회였다. 게다가 한국은 이번 월드컵에서 세트피스로 재미를 보던 팀이지 않은가. 그리고 그 사실을 알고 있는 벨기에 선수들의 표정엔 긴장감이 흘렀다. “각자 맡은 선수 확실하게 봐. 절대 놓치지 마!” “한국 애들 세트피스에서 제법 강한 거 알지? 방심하면 골 먹힐 수도 있으니까 조심해.” “정신 차리고 막자! 저 한국의 키커, 킥이 꽤 좋아.” 벨기에 선수들은 활발하게 의사소통을 하며 집중력을 끌어올렸다. 이때, 기석용의 발이 공을 강하게 감아 찼다. 페널티박스에 모인 선수들과 골키퍼와의 중간지점을 노리고 차낸 공이었다. 이때, 아주 좋은 위치에 있던 신재욱이 몸을 띄운 채, 공을 향해 머리를 가져다 댔다. 날아오는 공을 머리에 맞추기만 하면 골이 되는 상황. 그러나 그보다 더 높은 위치에서 머리로 공을 먼저 걷어낸 선수가 있었다. “다니엘……!” 다니엘 판바위턴. 바이에른 뮌헨의 중앙수비수로 신재욱의 소속팀 동료였다. 또한, 197cm라는 아주 큰 키와 거대한 체격으로 공중볼에서만큼은 그 누구에게도 밀리지 않는 선수였다. “재욱! 오늘 헤더로 골을 넣긴 힘들 거야. 내가 비록 늙긴 했지만, 공중볼 경합에서만큼은 안 질 자신이 있거든!” 도발적인 다니엘 판바위턴의 말. 그 말을 들으며, 신재욱은 씨익 웃어 보였다. “하필이면 다니엘이랑 적으로 만났네요.” “흐흐! 팀 동료라고 해서 살살할 거라는 생각은 하지 마. 오늘은 적으로 만났으니까 수단과 방법을 가리지 않고 네 엉덩이를 걷어차 줄 거야.” “다니엘을 괴롭힐 생각에 벌써 마음이 아프네요. 오늘 심하게 털리더라도 뭐라고 하지 마세요.” “바라던 바다! 나는 뒤끝 같은 거 없으니까 걱정하지 말고 덤벼!” 대화는 끝이 났다. 다니엘 판바위턴이 머리로 걷어낸 공이 라인 밖으로 나가며 다시 한국에게 코너킥이 주어진 상황이었고, 선수들 모두 집중력을 끌어올렸다. ‘역시 다니엘 판바위턴은 공중볼에서는 이기는 게 정말 어려운 선수야.’ 코너킥을 준비하는 기석용과 아주 가깝게 서 있는 다니엘 판바위턴을 번갈아 바라보며, 신재욱은 깊게 심호흡했다. ‘그래도 이길 수 있어.’ 바이에른 뮌헨에서의 훈련 때도 이런 상황은 자주 나왔다. 세트피스 상황에서 다니엘 판바위턴이 신재욱을 막고, 신재욱은 그런 다니엘 판바위턴의 수비를 이겨내며 골을 넣어야 하는 상황. 훈련 땐 다니엘 판바위턴이 승리할 때가 많았다. 신체조건에서 압도적이었으니까. 그러나 매번 지는 건 아니었다. 다섯 번 중 한두 번은 신재욱이 이기고 헤더 골을 넣었다. 즉, 충분히 승산이 있는 대결이었다. 더군다나 지금은 훈련이 아니었다. 실전이었다. ‘훈련과 실전은 다르지.’ 경기장을 가득 메운 팬들의 함성은 귀를 먹먹하게 만들 정도로 강력했고. 월드컵이라는 무대는 선수들에게 커다란 긴장감을 주며 집중력을 떨어뜨렸다. 다니엘 판바위턴 역시 긴장하고 있었다. 겉으론 웃으며 강한 척을 했지만, 사실은 식은땀을 흘리고 있었다. 다른 상대라면 모를까, 그가 막아야 하는 상대는 신재욱이었다. ‘신재욱은 내가 막아봤던 선수 중 가장 막기 힘든 녀석이야. 녀석은 잠깐이라도 놓치면 안 돼!’ 그리고 지금. 퍼어엉! 기석용이 코너킥을 찼다. 조금 전과는 다른 유형의 코너킥이었다.","completion":"191 * * * Coach Hong Jeong-tae was deep in thought. It was because of what Shin Jae-wook had said to him right after training ended. \\"To aim for higher places, we must not think of defeat...?\\" Honestly, his pride was hurt. He was the coach, and Shin Jae-wook was a player. Moreover, Shin Jae-wook was the youngest player on the national team. However, he couldn't ignore it. Shin Jae-wook's influence on the national team was significant, and he had shown exemplary behavior both as a player and as a person. \\"Jae-wook's words aren't wrong. It would indeed be better for the team's morale to advance to the round of 16 without any defeats.\\" Coach Hong Jeong-tae mulled over Shin Jae-wook's words carefully. However, negative thoughts continued to surface in his mind more than positive ones. The position of a coach always required considering even the worst-case scenarios. \\"The problem is whether we can really beat Belgium...\\" It would be great if they could beat Belgium. As Shin Jae-wook had said, the team could ride the momentum into the round of 16. But if they gave their all and still lost, they would lose a lot. The stamina of the key players would drop, and their confidence could be shaken. Coach Hong Jeong-tae was anxious about this. But in the end, he made a decision. \\"Shin Jae-wook really believes we can beat Belgium.\\" The look of certainty in the player's eyes. Could he give up the match after seeing such determination? He felt that would mean he didn't deserve to be a coach. \\"Let's do this! We're all human, so we can win, right?\\" With that shout, Coach Hong Jeong-tae looked at the documents neatly placed on his desk. They were the materials related to Belgium, which he thought he wouldn't need to look at closely. The next day. The atmosphere of the Korean national team changed overnight. The relaxed training atmosphere was gone. \\"We will beat Belgium and advance as the first place in Group H.\\" The change was due to the words uttered by Coach Hong Jeong-tae. Not just in words, the coach also intensified the training. 'I didn't have high expectations, but it seems he's changed his mind.' Shin Jae-wook smiled faintly as he looked at Coach Hong Jeong-tae. But that was only for a moment; soon after, he hardened his expression and raised his concentration. And he began to train more fiercely than anyone else. 'I'll make sure you don't regret that decision.' * * * Coach Hong Jeong-tae and the Korean national team players did their best in preparation for the match against Belgium. They analyzed Belgium's tactics and repeatedly practiced accordingly. All the players were enthusiastic. Although they didn't say it out loud, they all wanted to face Belgium with full strength. Days later. - The players are entering the stadium! The Korean national team players walked into the stadium to play against Belgium. - There's tension on the players' faces, isn't there? Both teams have secured their round of 16 spots with two wins, but perhaps it's because this match will determine the first place in Group H? - The round of 16 is confirmed, but this match is about pride! Both teams are undefeated, so they will definitely want to win today. In fact, looking at both teams' squads, haven't they fielded their main players? As the commentators said, both teams fielded their 100% main players. And Korean football fans showed their dismay at this fact. └ ????? When the starting lineups were announced, I thought it was a joke, but it's real...? What? We're going full force against Belgium...? Is this right...? └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Why is Coach Hong Jeong-tae like this?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Seriouslyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Does he really think we can beat Belgium? └ Ah;;;; Isn't this overdoing it? Belgium is too strong, isn't it? Wouldn't it be better to just play this game with reserve players, lose, and go all-in for the round of 16? └ That would be better. After all, the chances of beating Belgium are almost none. └ With Shin Jae-wook, Lee Taek-hyun, Son Heung-min, and Ki Sung-yueng, we can say we're capable against most teams... but... ah... Belgium is overkill. It seems like a game where we'll just waste the stamina of our main players. └ Of course, in football, you never know what will happen until you play... but Belgium is a bit... └ This Belgium squad is really overpoweredㄷㄷㄷ They're just going to face them head-on? Our squad seems to have the mindset that we can winㄷㄷ Belgium, participating in the 2014 World Cup, was known for its very strong team. They were considered a team that could even aim for the championship if they played well. Indeed, they had shown their strength by defeating both Russia and Algeria in Group H. Korean football fans knew all these facts, so they were bewildered and worried. At the same time. The faces of the Belgian national team players showed a sense of absurdity. \\"Look at the eyes of those Korean kids. They really think they can beat us.\\" \\"Huh! They don't know their place. Have they lost the ability to grasp reality after a few wins?\\" \\"Surely they don't think we're on the same level as Russia or Algeria? If so, that's just stupid.\\" \\"Kukuk! Don't be too harsh. Which team wants to lose? They also want to win, of course. It's just an impossible dream, though.\\" \\"Hahaha! Look at the eyes of those Korean kids. Do they think they're a strong team like France or Italy? Why do they look so determined when they're just a weak team?\\" The Belgian players laughed at the solemn expressions of the Korean players. That's when Musa Dembélé, who was responsible for Belgium's midfield, spoke up. \\"Everyone, stop it. We just need to crush them with our game. And don't be complacent. You know there are incredible guys in Korea, right?\\" His words carried a warning. Hearing this, the Belgian players looked at Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun and nodded. Although they were all underestimating Korea, they recognized Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun. They were the main players of Bayern Munich, who had recently won the Champions League. Especially Shin Jae-wook, who had been the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons and was considered a world-class player. Moments later, the referee blew the whistle. Whistle! - The match begins! South Korea and Belgium, both showing very good performances in the World Cup, finally face off! South Korea took the initiative. The Korean national team players, determined to win, confidently attempted an attack. Defensive midfielder Kim Kook-young passed the ball to Ki Sung-yueng, who then sent a forward pass to Lee Taek-hyun. Tuk! After receiving the ball, Lee Taek-hyun turned his body using a body feint. At that moment, Musa Dembélé came in with a strong body check. Simultaneously, the physically imposing Marouane Fellaini also charged in. \\"Ah!\\" Lee Taek-hyun fell down. He had withstood the charge from Musa Dembélé, but it was too much to withstand the following charge from Marouane Fellaini. Lee Taek-hyun had a good physique and usually didn't get pushed around. But Musa Dembélé and Marouane Fellaini were players with some of the best physicality in Europe. Fortunately, a foul was called. - Lee Taek-hyun is protesting strongly. However, no card has been given. - When Lee Taek-hyun received the ball, Belgium's pressure was very strong, wasn't it? Even if it results in a foul, they seem intent on disrupting Lee Taek-hyun's play. - He's a player who has been performing so well in this World Cup. If Shin Jae-wook is the one scoring goals, then Lee Taek-hyun is the player who creates opportunities for goals, right? Belgium seems to think that if they stop Lee Taek-hyun, Korea's attack won't be smooth. Korea's free-kick situation. The distance from the goal was about 40 meters, but with a good kicker like Ki Sung-yueng, it was still a good opportunity for Korea. Moreover, Korea had been enjoying success from set pieces in this World Cup. Aware of this fact, the Belgian players' faces showed tension. \\"Make sure to watch the player you're assigned to. Don't miss anyone!\\" \\"You know the Koreans are quite strong in set pieces, right? If you're not careful, we could concede a goal.\\" \\"Stay alert and block it! That Korean kicker has a pretty good kick.\\" The Belgian players actively communicated and raised their concentration. Then, Ki Sung-yueng's foot powerfully curled the ball. It was aimed at the midpoint between the players gathered in the penalty box and the goalkeeper. At that moment, Shin Jae-wook, who was in a very good position, leaped and headed towards the ball. It was a situation where a header would result in a goal. However, there was a player who headed the ball away from an even higher position. \\"Daniel...!\\" Daniel Van Buyten. The central defender for Bayern Munich and Shin Jae-wook's club teammate. He was also a player who, with his very tall height of 197cm and massive physique, was unbeatable in aerial duels. \\"Jae-wook! It'll be hard to score with a header today. I may be old, but I'm confident I won't lose in aerial duels!\\" Daniel Van Buyten's provocative words. Hearing them, Shin Jae-wook grinned. \\"It had to be Daniel that I'm up against as an opponent.\\" \\"Hehe! Don't think I'll go easy on you just because we're teammates. Since we're enemies today, I'll kick your butt without holding back.\\" \\"I'm already heartbroken thinking about how much I'll have to torment Daniel. Don't complain even if you get beaten up badly today.\\" \\"That's what I want! I don't hold grudges, so come at me!\\" The conversation ended. The ball that Daniel Van Buyten had headed away went out of bounds, giving Korea another corner kick, and all the players raised their concentration. 'As expected, Daniel Van Buyten is a really tough player to beat in aerial duels.' Looking alternately at Daniel Van Buyten, who was standing very close to Ki Sung-yueng preparing for the corner kick, Shin Jae-wook took a deep breath. 'But I can still win.' This situation had often occurred during training at Bayern Munich. In set piece situations, Daniel Van Buyten would defend against Shin Jae-wook, and Shin Jae-wook had to overcome his defense to score a goal. During training, Daniel Van Buyten often won. He was overwhelming in terms of physical condition. But it wasn't always a loss. One or two times out of five, Shin Jae-wook would win and score a header goal. In other words, it was a duel with a fair chance of winning. Moreover, this was not training. It was a real match. 'Training and real matches are different.' The cheers of the fans filling the stadium were so powerful they made one's ears ring. The stage of the World Cup brought great tension to the players and decreased their concentration. Daniel Van Buyten was also nervous. Although he laughed and acted strong on the outside, he was actually sweating coldly. Against any other opponent, it might be different, but the one he had to defend against was Shin Jae-wook. 'Shin Jae-wook is the most difficult player to defend against among those I've faced. I can't lose sight of him even for a moment!' And now. Puhreung! Ki Sung-yueng took the corner kick. It was a different type of corner kick than before."},{"prompt":"192 * * 다니엘 판바위턴. 197cm라는 괴물 같은 피지컬과 뛰어난 수비 능력으로 독일 최강의 팀인 바이에른 뮌헨에서 오랜 시간 주전 수비수로 활약했던 선수. 지금은 많은 나이로 인해서 신체능력이 떨어지며 은퇴를 생각해야 하는 선수였지만. 공중볼 경합에서는 여전히 최고 수준의 선수였다. 실제로 현재 최고의 스트라이커 중 한 명으로 평가받는 신재욱과의 공중볼 경합에서도 이겨내지 않았던가. ‘재욱, 내가 또 이겨주마!’ 한 번 이겼기 때문에, 자신감은 더욱 높아졌다. 그런데. 퍼어엉! 한국의 코너킥 유형이 방금과는 달랐다. 그리고 신재욱의 움직임 역시 달라졌다. “이런…!” 다니엘 판바위턴이 점프를 시작하려던 타이밍. 그 타이밍에 신재욱은 점프하지 않고 위치를 바꿨다. 코너킥을 차는 기석용과 최대한 가까운 곳으로 움직였다. 짧게 날아오는 코너킥을 끊어먹기 위해서였다. ‘코너킥은 높게만 찰 수 있는 게 아니거든요.’ 신재욱의 입가엔 옅은 미소가 떠올랐다. 모든 게 맞아떨어졌다. 자신을 마크하던 다니엘 판바위턴은 쫓아올 타이밍을 놓쳤고, 기석용이 차낸 공은 놀라울 정도로 정확하게 날아왔다. 훈련 때 연습했던 상황이 그대로 펼쳐졌다. ‘높은 코너킥이 막혔을 때 바로 낮은 코너킥을 시도하는 건 어찌 보면 흔한 방법인데, 이게 높은 레벨에서도 은근히 잘 통한단 말이야?’ 신재욱의 주도하에 연습한 코너킥이었다. 실제로 다른 한국 대표팀 선수들은 미리 준비한 대로 점프를 하고 있었다. 상대 수비수들을 속이기 위한 움직임이었다. 그리고 유일하게 점프하지 않은 신재욱이 낮게 날아오는 공의 방향을 바꿨다. 툭! 세게 찰 필요도 없었다. 워낙 강하게 날아오는 공이었기에, 골대 안을 향하게끔만 건드려주면 충분했다. 그것만으로도 벨기에의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 반응하지 못했다. ― 우오오오오오오오! 고오오오오오올! 골! 골입니다! 대한민국이 벨기에를 상대로 선제골을 터트렸습니다! 골을 넣은 선수는 신재욱입니다! ― 신재욱 선수가 또 해주네요! 코너킥 상황에서의 움직임이 너무 좋았죠! 기석용 선수와의 호흡도 좋았고요. ― 이건 100% 연습된 플레이입니다. 기석용 선수와 신재욱 선수, 그리고 다른 선수들 모두 세트피스를 열심히 준비해온 티가 나네요! 경기를 지켜보던 전 세계 축구팬들은 깜짝 놀랐다. 아직 이른 시간이었는데, 골이 나올 거라는 생각을 못 하고 있었기 때문이었다. 게다가 이들은 당연히 벨기에가 선제골을 넣을 것이라고 예상했었다. 한국이 선제골을 넣을 것이라는 생각은 전혀 못 하고 있었다. └ 골이다!!! 들어갔어!!! └ 한국의 스트라이커 너무 잘하는데? 쟤 누구야? └ 신재욱이잖아! 바이에른 뮌헨에서 뛰는 분데스리가 득점왕! └ 어? 신재욱이었어? 신재욱이 한국의 국가대표였구나? 난 신재욱이 어느 나라 사람인지 몰랐어. └ 한국은 신재욱의 활약 덕에 H조에서 1위에 오를 수도 있어. 이미 2승을 해서 16강은 확정됐고. └ 벨기에 선수들은 당황스럽겠는데? 솔직히 신재욱이랑 이택현이 있긴 하지만, 전력으로만 보면 벨기에가 훨씬 세잖아? 쟤들은 분명히 당연히 이길 줄 알았던 경기라고 생각했을 거야. └ 신재욱의 존재감 좀 봐봐! 쟤 하나로 한국은 무시할 수 없는 팀이 됐어! └ 이택현이랑 손훈민은 왜 빼는 거야? 얘네들도 엄청 잘해주고 있다고! 이처럼 한국이 선제골을 터트렸다는 사실에 전 세계 축구팬들이 놀라고 있을 때. 벨기에 대표팀 선수들은 더욱 당황하고 있었다. “뭐야? 다니엘, 어떻게 된 거야? 신재욱 마크를 놓치면 어떡해?” “우리가 한국 대표팀한테 먼저 골을 먹혔다고……? 이건 좀 어이없는데?” “이게 뭐야…… 신재욱이 잘하는 건 알았는데, 우리를 상대로도 이렇게 하네……?” “말도 안 돼……! 다니엘 판바위턴은 코너킥 상황에서 마크를 쉽게 놓치는 선수가 아닌데…….” 그중 가장 당황한 건 다니엘 판바위턴이었다. 신재욱을 마크하는 임무를 맡았던 그는 완전히 패배해버렸고, 그 패배는 곧바로 팀의 실점으로 이어지지 않았던가. 엄청난 죄책감이 몰려왔다. 그런데 원래라면 후회도 했을 것인데, 지금은 후회는 되지 않았다. 다니엘 판바위턴 본인의 실수가 아니라 그냥 너무나도 완벽하게 당해버렸기 때문이었다. ‘함께 훈련했을 때랑은 완전히 다른 패턴의 움직임이었어. 마치 처음 상대해본 선수처럼 느껴졌으니까…….’ 그저 감탄할 뿐이었다. 전혀 예상하지 못했던 심리전을 걸고, 새로운 패턴으로 움직이며 기어코 득점까지 해낸 신재욱의 실력에. “신재욱…… 설마 더 성장한 거냐?” 다니엘 판바위턴은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰어가고 있는 신재욱의 뒷모습을 바라봤다. 그 모습이 불과 몇 년 사이에 많이 커졌다는 생각이 들었다. “후우……! 적으로 만나기 가장 싫은 녀석이었는데…….” * * 신재욱은 옆구리에 공을 끼고, 경기장 중앙으로 달리며 미소를 지었다. “다행히 잘 통했네.” 그는 많은 경험이 있는 베테랑 스트라이커였다. 더군다나 세계적인 무대에서 최고의 공격수로 이름을 날리던 선수였다. 당연하게도 수비수와의 대결에서 이겨낼 여러 개의 패턴을 지니고 있었다. 세트피스 상황에서도 마찬가지였다. “바이에른 뮌헨에선 아직 안 해본 것 같아서 해본 건데, 잘 통했어.” 두 번째 코너킥에서 기석용이 낮게 크로스를 뿌리는 건 이미 맞춰온 플레이였다. 다만, 그 안에서 다니엘 판바위턴의 마크를 벗겨내는 건 온전히 신재욱의 몫이었다. 그래서 평소엔 거의 하지 않던 새로운 스타일의 심리전을 사용했다. 몸에 잘 맞는 스타일은 아니었지만, 자신에 대해서 잘 아는 다니엘 판바위턴의 마크를 벗겨내기엔 아주 좋은 방법이었다. 우와아아아아! 강렬한 함성이 귓속으로 파고들었다. 신재욱의 미소는 더욱 짙어졌다. “월드컵이라 그런지 관중들 반응이 더 뜨겁네.” 피부를 저릿하게 만드는 함성을 즐기며, 공을 내려놓았다. 그러곤 한국대표팀 동료들을 바라보며 크게 외쳤다. “바로 한 골 더 넣을 거니까 집중해서 도와주세요!” 정말 골을 넣지 못하더라도 팀의 기세를 높일 수 있는 행동이었다. 물론 신재욱은 진심으로 골을 만들어낼 생각이었지만. “가보자! 재욱아! 내가 어떻게든 네가 골 넣을 수 있게 도와줄게!” “우리도 벨기에 한 번 잡아보자!” “감독님 말처럼 조 1위로 16강 가자!” “으하하! 그냥 다 이겨버리자고!” 한국 대표팀의 기세는 높아졌다. 선제골과 이어진 신재욱의 외침이 만들어낸 효과였다. ― 선제골을 넣은 이후로 우리 선수들의 움직임에 자신감이 보이죠? ― 정말 그렇네요. 한국 선수들의 마음이 한결 편해진 것 같습니다. 이젠 조금씩 여유 있게 볼을 돌리고 있습니다. 경기가 재개된 이후, 한국은 실수 없이 천천히 패스를 주고받았다. 그리고 벨기에는 그런 한국을 가만히 두지 않았다. 최전방에 있던 로멜루 루카쿠, 에덴 아자르, 케빈 미랄라스와 미드필더진에 있던 마루앙 펠라이니, 무사 뎀벨레, 스테번 드푸르가 한국을 강하게 압박했다. 게다가 수비수들까지도 라인을 올리며 강한 압박에 힘을 실었다. 한국 대표팀 선수들이 느끼는 압박감은 상당했다. 대부분의 선수가 숨이 턱 막히는 느낌을 받았고, 흐르던 여유도 온데간데없이 사라져버렸다. ― 벨기에의 압박이 대단히 강한데요? 우리 선수들이 힘들어하는 게 눈에 보이네요. ― 한국 대표팀은 압박에 약한 모습을 보여줄 때가 많은데, 부디 이겨냈으면 좋겠습니다. ― 이럴 때일수록 침착함을 가져야겠죠. 벨기에의 압박은 성공적이었다. 공을 잡고 몸을 돌리려던 김국영이 마루앙 펠라이니의 압박을 이겨내지 못하고 넘어져 버렸다. 반칙은 선언되지 않았다. 김국영은 억울하다는 표정으로 항의했지만, 심판은 정당한 몸싸움이라고 판단을 내렸다. 벨기에의 공격이 시작됐다. 마루앙 펠라이니는 직접 드리블하지 않고, 곧바로 패스를 선택했다. ― 펠라이니 선수가 무사 뎀벨레 선수에게 패스합니다! 이때, 무사 뎀벨레는 펠라이니와는 다르게 직접 공을 드리블하며 전진했다. 세계 최고 수준의 탈압박 능력을 지닌 그는 어지간해선 공을 빼앗기지 않는 선수였고, 지금도 자신감 있는 드리블로 한국의 중앙수비수 홍정오를 뚫어냈다. ― 홍정오 선수가 뚫렸습니다! 위험합니다! 막아야 합니다! 무사 뎀벨레에게 슈팅 타이밍이 나왔다. 그는 그 타이밍에 맞춰서 공을 앞으로 툭― 밀어냈다. 슈팅이 아닌, 패스였다. 빠른 속도로 침투하는 에덴 아자르를 노린 절묘한 패스. ― 에덴 아자르가 공을 받습니다! 현시점에서 프리미어리그 최고의 선수 중 한 명인 에덴 아자르. 그는 왼발로 공을 받은 뒤, 곧바로 오른발을 휘둘러 슈팅을 때려냈다. 침착함이 묻어나오는 움직임이었다. 한국의 골키퍼 정석룡은 반응하지 못했다. 그가 할 수 있는 건 구석으로 들어가는 공을 바라보며, 깊게 탄식하는 것뿐이었다. “아……!” 동점을 만드는 벨기에의 골. 그 골을 터트린 에덴 아자르는 벨기에의 동료들과 끌어안으며 기뻐했다. ― 아…… 역시 벨기에의 화력은 무섭습니다……! 기회가 생기자, 곧바로 골을 만들어내네요. 우리 선수들은 공을 가지고 있을 때, 뺏기지 않는 것에 더 신경을 써야 할 것 같습니다. ― 그나저나 무사 뎀벨레 선수의 드리블이 굉장히 위협적이네요. 홍정오 선수는 일대일에서 쉽게 지는 선수가 아닌데, 방금은 무사 뎀벨레 선수한테 아무것도 하지 못하고 져버렸거든요? ― 무사 뎀벨레 선수도 대단했지만, 에덴 아자르 선수의 움직임도 날카로웠습니다. 완벽한 침투 타이밍으로 대한민국의 오프사이드 트랩을 깨버렸죠. 같은 시각, 신재욱은 기뻐하는 벨기에 선수들을 바라보며 고개를 끄덕였다. “잘하네. 벨기에다워.” 그는 동점 골을 허용한 것에 전혀 놀라지 않고 있었다. 예상 범위 안에 있던 일이었으니까. 벨기에와의 경기를 앞뒀을 때, 신재욱은 머릿속으로 여러 상황에 대해서 수없이 많은 시뮬레이션을 돌렸었다. 지금처럼 1 대 1이 된 상황도 여러 개의 시뮬레이션 중 하나일 뿐이었다. “다음 골을 어디가 넣냐에 따라서 분위기도 크게 달라질 것 같은데.” 신재욱은 골을 넣고 싶었다. 그렇게 할 수 있다는 자신감도 있었다. 그러나 자신의 골보다 벨기에의 추가 골이 더 빨리 나올 수도 있겠다는 생각이 들었다. “벨기에의 다른 선수들도 다 잘하지만, 몸 관리가 잘되어있고 컨디션이 좋은 에덴 아자르는 진짜 장난이 아니라서.” 신재욱의 기억 속엔 레알 마드리드에서 뛰는 에덴 아자르의 모습과 첼시에서 뛰던 에덴 아자르의 모습이 남아있다. 그중 어떤 아자르가 더 위협적이었냐고 묻는다면, 너무나도 쉽게 대답할 수 있다. 바로 첼시 FC였다. “첼시에서 뛰는 에덴 아자르는 세계 최고 수준이지.” 그리고 지금. 눈앞에 보이는 에덴 아자르 역시 첼시 FC 소속이었다. 즉, 최고의 컨디션을 지닌 에덴 아자르였다. “우리 수비수들이 되게 힘든 경기를 하게 될 거야.” 신재욱은 쓰게 웃으며, 동료 수비수들을 바라봤다.","completion":"192 * * * Daniel Van Buyten. A player who had been a main defender for a long time at Bayern Munich, Germany's strongest team, thanks to his monstrous physicality of 197cm and excellent defensive abilities. Although he was now an older player whose physical abilities had declined, making him consider retirement, he was still one of the best in aerial duels. In fact, hadn't he just won an aerial duel against Shin Jae-wook, one of the current best strikers? 'Jae-wook, I'll beat you again!' Having won once, his confidence was even higher. But then. Puhreung! The type of corner kick from Korea was different from before. And Shin Jae-wook's movement had also changed. \\"Oh no...!\\" At the timing when Daniel Van Buyten was about to jump. At that timing, Shin Jae-wook didn't jump but changed his position, moving as close as possible to Ki Sung-yueng, who was taking the corner kick. It was to intercept the short corner kick. 'Corner kicks aren't only meant to be high.' A faint smile appeared on Shin Jae-wook's lips. Everything fell into place. Daniel Van Buyten, who had been marking him, missed the timing to follow, and the ball kicked by Ki Sung-yueng flew with astonishing accuracy. The situation they had practiced in training unfolded exactly. 'Using a low corner kick after a high one is blocked is a common tactic, but it surprisingly works well even at high levels?' It was a corner kick practiced under Shin Jae-wook's lead. In fact, the other Korean national team players were jumping as they had prepared in advance. It was a movement to deceive the opposing defenders. And Shin Jae-wook, the only one who didn't jump, redirected the low-flying ball. Tuk! There was no need to hit it hard. The ball was already flying with such force that all it needed was a slight touch to direct it towards the goal. That alone was enough for Belgium's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to be unable to react. - Wow! Goal! Goal! South Korea has scored the opening goal against Belgium! The scorer is Shin Jae-wook! - Shin Jae-wook does it again! His movement in the corner kick situation was excellent! And so was his coordination with Ki Sung-yueng. - This is 100% a practiced play. Ki Sung-yueng, Shin Jae-wook, and the other players all show that they have diligently prepared for set pieces! As football fans around the world were surprised by the fact that Korea had scored the opening goal, the Belgian national team players were even more flustered. \\"What? Daniel, what happened? How could you lose the mark on Shin Jae-wook?\\" \\"We conceded the first goal to the Korean national team...? This is a bit ridiculous, isn't it?\\" \\"What is this... I knew Shin Jae-wook was good, but he's doing this against us too...?\\" \\"It doesn't make sense...! Daniel Van Buyten isn't a player who easily loses his mark in corner kick situations...\\" Among them, Daniel Van Buyten was the most flustered. He had been tasked with marking Shin Jae-wook and had been completely defeated, and that defeat had led directly to a goal for his team. An immense sense of guilt overwhelmed him. But whereas he would normally have regretted it, this time he didn't. It wasn't because of a mistake by Daniel Van Buyten; he had just been perfectly outplayed. 'It was a completely different pattern of movement from when we trained together. It felt like facing a player I had never encountered before...' He could only admire it. The psychological warfare that he had not anticipated at all, the new pattern of movement, and the fact that Shin Jae-wook had managed to score. \\"Shin Jae-wook... have you grown even more?\\" Daniel Van Buyten watched the back of Shin Jae-wook running towards the center of the field. He felt that Shin Jae-wook had grown a lot in just a few years. \\"Phew...! He's the last person I wanted to face as an opponent...\\" * * * Shin Jae-wook, with the ball under his arm, ran towards the center of the field with a smile. \\"Fortunately, it worked well.\\" He was a veteran striker with a lot of experience. Moreover, he was a player who had made a name for himself as one of the best attackers on the global stage. Naturally, he had several patterns to win duels against defenders. The same was true for set pieces. \\"I haven't tried it at Bayern Munich yet, so I gave it a shot, and it worked.\\" The low cross from Ki Sung-yueng on the second corner kick was a play they had already coordinated. However, shaking off Daniel Van Buyten's mark was entirely up to Shin Jae-wook. So he used a new style of psychological warfare that he usually didn't use. It wasn't a style that suited him well, but it was a very good way to shake off the mark of Daniel Van Buyten, who knew him well. Wow! Intense cheers penetrated his ears. Shin Jae-wook's smile deepened. \\"The reaction of the fans is even hotter because it's the World Cup.\\" Enjoying the tingling sensation of the cheers, he placed the ball down. Then he looked at his teammates on the Korean national team and shouted loudly. \\"Focus and help me out because I'm going to score another goal right away!\\" It was an action that could raise the team's morale even if he didn't actually score a goal. Of course, Shin Jae-wook was serious about creating another goal. \\"Let's go! Jae-wook! I'll help you score a goal in any way I can!\\" \\"Let's take down Belgium this time!\\" \\"Like the coach said, let's go to the round of 16 as the first in the group!\\" \\"Uhaha! Let's just win everything!\\" The momentum of the Korean national team was high. It was the effect created by the opening goal and Shin Jae-wook's shout. - You can see the confidence in our players' movements after scoring the opening goal, right? - Really. It seems like the Korean players' minds have become more relaxed. Now they are passing the ball around with a bit more ease. After the game resumed, Korea exchanged passes slowly without making mistakes. And Belgium did not just stand by. Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard, Kevin Mirallas in the front, and Marouane Fellaini, Musa Dembélé, Steven Defour in the midfield pressed Korea strongly. Even the defenders raised their line to add strength to the intense pressure. The pressure felt by the Korean national team players was significant. Most of the players felt suffocated, and the ease they had been feeling disappeared. - Belgium's pressure is very strong, isn't it? You can see our players struggling. - The Korean national team often shows weakness under pressure; hopefully, they can overcome it. - Especially at times like this, they need to maintain their composure. Belgium's pressure was successful. Kim Kook-young, who tried to turn with the ball, couldn't withstand Marouane Fellaini's pressure and fell. No foul was called. Kim Kook-young protested with a look of injustice, but the referee judged it to be a fair physical challenge. Belgium's attack began. Marouane Fellaini chose to pass immediately instead of dribbling. - Fellaini passes to Musa Dembélé! At that moment, unlike Fellaini, Musa Dembélé advanced with the ball, dribbling directly. With one of the best abilities to break pressure in the world, he was a player who rarely lost the ball, and now he confidently dribbled past Korea's central defender Hong Jeong-oh. - Hong Jeong-oh has been breached! It's dangerous! They need to block it! Musa Dembélé had a chance to shoot. At that timing, he pushed the ball forward. It wasn't a shot, but a pass. A precise pass aimed at Eden Hazard, who was penetrating at high speed. - Eden Hazard receives the ball! One of the best players in the Premier League at the moment, Eden Hazard. After receiving the ball with his left foot, he immediately swung his right foot to shoot. It was a movement exuding calmness. Korea's goalkeeper Jung Seok-ryong couldn't react. All he could do was watch the ball go into the corner and sigh deeply. \\"Ah...!\\" Belgium's equalizing goal. Eden Hazard, who scored the goal, celebrated with his Belgian teammates. - Ah... Belgium's firepower is indeed frightening...! As soon as they had the chance, they immediately created a goal. Our players need to be more careful not to lose the ball when they have it. - By the way, Musa Dembélé's dribble was very threatening. Hong Jeong-oh is not a player who easily loses one-on-one, but he just lost to Musa Dembélé without being able to do anything, right? - Musa Dembélé was impressive, but Eden Hazard's movement was also sharp. He broke South Korea's offside trap with perfect timing for penetration. At the same time, Shin Jae-wook watched the celebrating Belgian players and nodded. \\"They're good. That's so Belgian.\\" He wasn't surprised at all by conceding the equalizing goal. It was within the range of his expectations. When preparing for the match against Belgium, Shin Jae-wook had run countless simulations in his head for various situations. The current situation of 1 to 1 was just one of those simulations. \\"It seems like the atmosphere will change a lot depending on who scores the next goal.\\" Shin Jae-wook wanted to score. He had the confidence to do so. But he also thought that Belgium's additional goal might come sooner than his own. \\"Other Belgian players are also good, but Eden Hazard, who is well-managed and in good condition, is no joke.\\" In Shin Jae-wook's memory, he remembered Eden Hazard playing for Real Madrid and Chelsea. If asked which Hazard was more threatening, he could easily answer. It was Chelsea FC. And now. The Eden Hazard he saw before him was also from Chelsea FC. In other words, it was Eden Hazard in his best condition. \\"Our defenders are going to have a really tough game.\\" Shin Jae-wook smiled bitterly as he looked at his fellow defenders."},{"prompt":"193 * * * 올해 온라인상에서 전 세계 축구팬들을 상대로 투표가 이뤄진 적이 있다. 현시점에서 세계 최고의 드리블러가 누구인지를 뽑는 투표였다. 그 결과 가장 많은 표를 받진 못했지만, 어렵지 않게 세 손가락 안에 들었던 선수가 있다. 첼시 FC의 에덴 아자르였다. ― 에덴 아자르! 대한민국의 수비를 휘젓고 있습니다! 우리 선수들은 이 에덴 아자르 선수의 드리블을 경계해야 합니다! 세계 최고의 리그 중 하나인 프리미어리그에서도 가장 드리블이 좋은 선수거든요! ― 경각심을 갖고 막아야죠. 이 에덴 아자르 선수를 막을 땐 절대 함부로 발을 뻗어서는 안 됩니다. 에덴 아자르는 상대가 발을 뻗는 타이밍을 보면서 드리블을 하거든요! 에덴 아자르의 드리블은 한국 대표팀에게도 아주 잘 통하고 있었다. 너무나도 쉽게 한국 수비수들을 농락했고, 좋은 슈팅도 뻥뻥 때려댔다. ― 오우! 에덴 아자르의 슈팅을 정석룡 골키퍼가 간신히 쳐냈습니다! 에덴 아자르가 코너킥을 얻어냅니다! 코너킥 상황. 수비에 가담하기 위해서 페널티박스 안으로 들어온 신재욱이 작게 한숨을 내쉬었다. ‘이럴 것 같긴 했는데.’ 예상했던 일들이 벌어지고 있었다. 냉정하게 평가했을 때, 한국의 수비수들은 에덴 아자르를 막아낼 실력이 안 된다. 이렇게 쉽게 뚫려버리는 것도 이상한 일이 아니었다. ‘그래도 다행히 실점은 안 했어.’ 신재욱은 대표팀의 골키퍼 정석룡을 힐끗 바라봤다. 최근 컨디션이 좋아 보였던 그는 몇 차례나 훌륭한 선방을 보여주고 있었다. ‘든든하네. 정석룡이 아니었으면 2골은 더 먹혔을 수도 있어.’ 그때였다. 신재욱이 기민하게 움직였다. 에덴 아자르가 코너킥을 찼기 때문이었다. ‘내가 같이 막아줘야 해.’ 지금과 같은 세트피스 상황에서 가장 위협적인 선수는 벨기에의 스트라이커 로멜루 루카쿠였다. 191cm에 100kg이 넘는 거대한 체격을 지녔고, 그에 어울리지 않는 빠른 스피드와 운동능력을 보유한 괴물. 그게 바로 로멜루 루카쿠였다. ‘우리 수비 한 명으로는 못 막을 테니까.’ 혹시나 동료가 막아줄 수 있지 않을까? 라는 생각은 하지 않았다. 신재욱은 로멜루 루카쿠가 지닌 능력을 너무나도 잘 알고 있었으니까. ‘절대 못 막아.’ 현재 로멜루 루카쿠를 마크하고 있는 선수는 한국의 수비수 홍정오였고, 신재욱은 그쪽으로 바짝 붙은 채로 몸을 띄웠다. 퍼억! 신재욱은 홍정오와 함께 로멜루 루카쿠와 부딪쳤다. 단단한 바위와 부딪친 느낌이었다. ‘로멜루 루카쿠 이 친구의 피지컬은 괴물이라니까.’ 공중볼 경합을 하는 것만으로도 몸에서 강한 통증을 느꼈다. 그러나 경합의 결과는 좋았다. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 걷어냈습니다! 홍정오 선수가 홀로 로멜루 루카쿠 선수를 막는 게 어렵다고 판단했는지, 도움을 줬네요. 신재욱 선수가 이제는 수비에서도 영향력을 보여주고 있습니다! ― 워낙 공중볼 경합에 강한 선수이지 않습니까? 로멜루 루카쿠 선수 역시 엄청난 피지컬과 신체능력을 지닌 선수라지만, 신재욱 선수도 쉽게 밀리지 않을 선수거든요! 다행히 위기를 넘겼지만, 한국의 수비진은 계속해서 불안한 모습을 보여줬다. 에덴 아자르, 로멜루 루카쿠, 무사 뎀벨레, 마루앙 펠라이니, 스테번 드푸르, 케빈 미랄라스는 날카로운 패스와 슈팅을 계속해서 시도하며 한국의 골문을 노렸다. ‘웬만하면 수비수들한테 넘어가기 전에 막아줘야겠는데?’ 신재욱은 넓은 시야와 많은 경험을 이용해 계속해서 상황을 파악했다. 승리할 확률을 높이기 위해선 어떻게 해야 할지에 대해서 계속해서 고민했다. 그러면서도 공을 잡을 때면 안정적인 모습을 보여줬다. ― 신재욱 선수가 공을 지켜냅니다. 이 선수는 정말 든든하네요! 최전방에서 공을 잡으면 꼭 동료에게 연결해줍니다. 벨기에의 수비수들 사이에서도 절대 공을 뺏기질 않고 있고요! 전방에 있던 신재욱이 공을 잡았다. 이택현이 건네준 공이었다. ‘이번엔 과감하게 때려봐야겠어.’ 신재욱은 공을 받을 때부터 슈팅을 마음먹고, 몸을 돌리려고 했다. 그러나 그 의도를 빠르게 눈치챈 다니엘 판바위턴이 이미 강한 압박을 펼쳤다. 퍼억! 다니엘 판바위턴 같은 거구를 등진 채로 몸을 돌리는 건 어려운 일이었다. 웬만한 공격수는 그의 앞에서 감히 몸을 돌릴 생각을 못 한다. 이미 세계적인 수준의 스트라이커가 된 신재욱에게도 쉬운 일이 아니었다. 그러나 불가능한 일도 아니었다. ‘단순히 힘으로 보면 내가 밀리겠지만, 축구는 기술도 중요하거든.’ 신재욱은 소속팀인 바이에른 뮌헨의 팀훈련에서 동료 수비수들과 많은 대결을 해왔다. 승률 역시 매우 높았다. 바이에른 뮌헨의 수비수들은 세계적인 실력을 지닌 선수들이었지만, 신재욱을 잘 막아내지 못했다. 그리고 그 수비수엔 다니엘 판바위턴도 포함이었다. 툭! 휘익! 신재욱은 다니엘 판바위턴을 등진 채, 공을 컨트롤하며 왼쪽으로 몸을 틀었다. 다니엘 판바위턴은 신재욱이 왼쪽으로 돌지 못하게끔 막아섰다. 하지만 신재욱의 움직임이 더 빨랐다. 이미 어깨를 집어넣으며 강하게 파고들었으니까. “이런!” 다니엘 판바위턴이 당황하며 팔을 뻗었다. 그는 여러 번 경험해봤기 때문에 알고 있었다. 이대로 신재욱을 놓치면 팀이 큰 위기를 맞게 될 거라는 걸. 그래서 반칙이라는 걸 알면서도 손을 뻗은 것이었다. 화악! 다니엘 판바위턴은 신재욱의 유니폼 상의를 잡아당겼다. “아 왜 옷을 잡고 그러실까?” 전진하려던 신재욱이 움직임을 멈췄다. 유니폼을 붙잡힌 상황에선 앞으로 나아가는 게 쉽지 않았다. 억지로 전진하려면 할 수도 있겠지만 굳이 그럴 필요는 없었다. 삐이이익! 주심이 반칙을 선언했으니까. ― 주심이 카드를 꺼내 들었습니다! 다니엘 판바위턴 선수에게 옐로카드를 주네요. ― 카드를 받는 게 맞죠. 판바위턴 선수가 신재욱 선수를 놓쳤다면, 실점까지도 나올 수 있던 상황이니까요. 신재욱은 다니엘 판바위턴을 향해 장난이 섞인 짜증을 냈다. “다니엘! 옷 찢어지겠어요.” “안 찢어졌잖아. 그리고 이렇게라도 막아야지 어쩌겠냐?” “우리 페어플레이하자고요. 같은 팀 동료잖아요?” “야! 팀 동료니까 이렇게 막는 거지. 내가 네 실력을 몰라? 페어플레이 같은 거 하려다간 바로 뚫리고 실점해버릴걸?” “대단한 수비수면서 왜 이래요?” “대단하긴, 은퇴를 바로 앞에 둔 늙은 선수일 뿐인데.” “약한 척 좀 하지 마요.” “재욱, 너야말로 노인공경 좀 하는 게 어때? 널 막느라 벌써 무릎이랑 허리가 쑤신다고.” “하하! 아마 오늘 경기가 끝나면 병원 치료 좀 받으셔야 할 겁니다.” 짧은 대화 끝에 신재욱은 다니엘 판바위턴과 주먹을 맞댄 뒤, 공을 들어 올렸다. 직접 얻어낸 프리킥을 직접 찰 생각이었다. 거리와 위치 모두 마음에 들었다. 연습할 때, 자주 프리킥 골을 넣던 위치였다. ― 신재욱 선수가 프리킥을 찰 준비를 하네요. 이 선수, 프리킥을 굉장히 잘 차죠! ― 그렇습니다. 신재욱 선수는 분데스리가에서도 프리킥으로 꽤 많은 골을 넣었고, 챔피언스리그에서도 멋진 프리킥 골을 보여준 적이 있죠. 그래서 기대가 됩니다! 지금처럼 팀이 밀리는 상황에서 프리킥 골을 넣어주면 우리 대표팀 선수들의 자신감도 더욱 높아질 것 같거든요? 신재욱은 조용히 공을 내려놓았다. 오로지 프리킥 상황에만 집중하고 있었다. ‘이건 넣어야지.’ 쉽게 얻을 기회가 아니었기에, 더욱 살리고 싶었다. 프리킥을 성공시켜 벨기에의 기세를 조금이나마 꺾어내고 싶어졌다. 스윽! 신재욱은 주심을 바라보며 고개를 끄덕였다. 찰 준비가 끝났다는 신호였다. 주심은 휘슬을 불며 프리킥을 차도 좋다는 답을 줬다. 그 순간 경기장에 있던 모두가 신재욱의 움직임에 집중했다. 같은 시각, 수비벽을 세운 벨기에 선수들과 벨기에의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 긴장한 감정을 숨기지 못했다. 이들 모두 신재욱의 위상을 충분히 알고 있었기 때문이었다. 얼마나 잘하는 선수인지, 프리킥을 얼마나 잘 차는 선수인지 알기에 긴장할 수밖에 없었다. 그때였다. ‘어?’ 신재욱의 눈엔 보였다. 벨기에의 수비벽 밑에 생긴 빈틈이. ‘공간이 있는데?’ 넓은 틈은 아니었다. 공 한 개가 간신히 들어갈 정도의 작은 틈. 저곳으로 공을 집어넣는 건 매우 힘든 일이었다. ‘해보자.’ 신재욱은 결정했다. 저 틈을 향해 슈팅하기로. ‘멋진 골은 도전할 때 나오는 거니까.’ 공을 향해 움직였다. 타닷! 탓! 특유의 리듬으로 움직이며 점점 속도를 높였다. 그리고 마침내 공의 앞에 도착했을 때. 신재욱은 다리를 휘둘렀다. 퍼엉! 강렬한 타격음이 터졌다. 잔뜩 긴장하고 있던 벨기에의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 공의 궤적을 쫓기 위해 눈을 부릅떴다. 그러나 공의 궤적은 보이지 않았다. 보여야 할 시간이 지났음에도 보이지 않았다. “아!” 무언가 이상함을 깨달은 티보 쿠르투아는 고개를 돌려 골대 안을 바라봤다. 공은 낮게 깔린 채, 이미 그곳을 향해 파고들고 있었다. 몸을 날리기엔 늦어버린 상황. “으아아아!” 티보 쿠르투아는 짜증을 내며 애꿎은 잔디를 걷어찼다. * * * 우와아아아아! 경기장에 함성이 터져 나왔다. 현장에서 엄청난 프리킥 골이 나왔기 때문이었다. ― 우와아아! 들어갔습니다! 골입니다! 신재욱 선수가 프리킥을 성공시키며 골을 터트렸습니다! ― 와……! 이걸 낮게 차서 골을 넣네요? 전혀 예상하지 못했습니다. 저희에게는 보이지 않던 틈이 신재욱 선수에겐 보이는 것 같습니다! 느린 화면으로 다시 보실까요? ― 지금 느리게 나오는 화면을 보시면 벨기에 선수들이 세운 벽에 아주 약간의 틈이 있거든요? 낮게 깔아 차면 공 하나가 딱 들어갈 만한 틈이네요. 그리고 신재욱 선수가 때린 슈팅이 그 틈으로 정확히 빠져나갔습니다! ― 이렇게 느리게 보니까 더 놀랍네요. 저 좁은 틈으로 슈팅할 생각을 한 것도 놀라운데, 그걸 성공했다는 게 더욱 놀랍습니다! 신재욱 선수는 이제 슈팅의 달인이 된 것 같네요! 관중들의 함성은 멈추지 않았다. 놀라울 정도로 높은 수준의 프리킥 골을 보여준 신재욱의 이름이 경기장 안에 울려 퍼졌다. “이게 되네?” 수비벽 사이에 빈틈이 보여서 기습적으로 시도한 것이었는데, 생각했던 것보다 더 훌륭하게 성공해버렸다. 겉으로 티를 내고 있진 않았지만, 솔직히 신재욱도 놀라고 있었다. “이 맛에 도전하지.” 멋진 골을 넣었다는 사실에 기분이 좋아졌다. 골을 넣은 자신보다도 더 기뻐하는 동료들의 모습도 좋았다. 다만 좋아하는 것도 잠시, 신재욱은 표정을 굳혔다. 더는 좋아할 수가 없었다. 벨기에 측이 선수 교체를 준비하고 있었으니까. “지금보다 더 어려워지겠어.” 위험한 선수들의 얼굴이 보였으니까. ― 벨기에가 선수를 교체합니다! 아직 이른 시간인데 벌써 선수를 교체하네요? ― 한국에게 절대 지지 않겠다는 것 같습니다! 이 선수들이 나오네요…! 교체되어 들어오는 선수는 2명이었다. 놀라운 일이었다. 보통은 전반전에 선수를 교체하지도 않을뿐더러, 2명이나 교체하는 일은 거의 없었으니까. “더 열심히 뛰어야겠네.” 신재욱이 쓰게 웃으며 땀에 젖은 붉은 머리를 쓸어올렸다.","completion":"193 * * * Earlier this year, there was an online poll conducted among football fans worldwide. It was a vote to determine who the best dribbler in the world was at the current time. Although he didn't receive the most votes, one player easily made it into the top three. It was Eden Hazard of Chelsea FC. - Eden Hazard! He's wreaking havoc on South Korea's defense! Our players need to be wary of Hazard's dribbling! He's one of the best dribblers in the Premier League, which is one of the top leagues in the world! - They need to be vigilant. You can't just recklessly stick out a foot against Eden Hazard. He dribbles while watching for the opponent to make a move! Eden Hazard's dribbling was proving very effective against the Korean national team. He was easily toying with the Korean defenders and taking powerful shots. - Oh! Eden Hazard's shot is barely saved by goalkeeper Jung Seok-ryong! Hazard has won a corner kick! In the corner kick situation, Shin Jae-wook, who had joined the defense in the penalty box, let out a small sigh. 'I had a feeling this would happen.' What he had anticipated was unfolding. Realistically, the Korean defenders were not skilled enough to stop Eden Hazard. It wasn't surprising that they were being so easily breached. 'At least we haven't conceded a goal.' Shin Jae-wook glanced at the national team's goalkeeper, Jung Seok-ryong. Recently looking in good form, he had made several excellent saves. 'He's reliable. If it weren't for Seok-ryong, we could have conceded two more goals by now.' That's when it happened. Shin Jae-wook moved quickly. It was because Eden Hazard had taken the corner kick. 'I need to help defend.' In the current set-piece situation, the most threatening player was Belgium's striker Romelu Lukaku. A monster with a height of 191cm and over 100kg, he had a giant physique that didn't match his fast speed and athletic ability. 'There's no way our defenders can stop him alone.' Shin Jae-wook didn't entertain the thought that maybe his teammates could stop him. He knew too well the abilities that Romelu Lukaku possessed. 'They absolutely can't stop him.' The current player marking Romelu Lukaku was Korea's defender Hong Jeong-oh, and Shin Jae-wook moved close to assist. Thump! Shin Jae-wook collided with Hong Jeong-oh against Romelu Lukaku. It felt like hitting a solid rock. Just competing in the aerial duel caused a strong pain in his body. However, the result of the duel was favorable. - Shin Jae-wook has cleared the ball! It seems he decided to help Hong Jeong-oh, who was struggling to defend Romelu Lukaku alone. Now Shin Jae-wook is showing his influence even in defense! - He's always been strong in aerial duels, hasn't he? Romelu Lukaku is also a player with tremendous physicality and athletic ability, but Shin Jae-wook is not easily pushed around either! Although they managed to avert the danger, the Korean defense continued to show signs of instability. Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Musa Dembélé, Marouane Fellaini, Steven Defour, and Kevin Mirallas kept trying sharp passes and shots, targeting the Korean goal. 'Maybe I should try to stop them before the ball gets to our defenders?' Shin Jae-wook used his wide vision and extensive experience to keep assessing the situation. He continuously pondered how to increase the chances of victory. Even so, when he had the ball, he showed stability. - Shin Jae-wook has protected the ball. He's really reliable! Whenever he gets the ball in the front, he always connects it to a teammate. He never loses the ball, even among Belgian defenders! Shin Jae-wook received the ball in the front. It was a pass from Lee Taek-hyun. 'This time, I should take a bold shot.' Shin Jae-wook intended to shoot as soon as he received the ball and tried to turn around. However, Daniel Van Buyten, who quickly noticed his intention, had already put on strong pressure. Thump! Turning around with a giant like Daniel Van Buyten on his back was difficult. Most attackers wouldn't dare to turn in front of him. It wasn't easy even for Shin Jae-wook, who had become a world-class striker. But it wasn't impossible either. 'If it's just about strength, I might be at a disadvantage, but football is also about skill.' Shin Jae-wook had faced many duels with his fellow defenders during team training at Bayern Munich. His win rate was also very high. The defenders at Bayern Munich were world-class players, but they struggled to stop Shin Jae-wook. And that included Daniel Van Buyten. Tuk! Whisk! Shin Jae-wook controlled the ball with his back to Daniel Van Buyten and twisted his body to the left. Daniel Van Buyten tried to block him from turning left, but Shin Jae-wook's movement was faster. He had already inserted his shoulder and pushed through strongly. \\"Oh no!\\" Daniel Van Buyten reached out in panic. He knew from experience that if he lost Shin Jae-wook now, his team would face a big crisis. That's why he reached out his hand, knowing it was a foul. Whoosh! Daniel Van Buyten grabbed Shin Jae-wook's jersey. \\"Why are you grabbing my shirt?\\" Shin Jae-wook stopped moving forward. It wasn't easy to move forward with his jersey being held. He could have forced his way through, but there was no need to. Whistle! The referee had called the foul. - The referee is pulling out a card! He's giving Daniel Van Buyten a yellow card. - That's the right call. If Van Buyten had lost Shin Jae-wook, it could have led to a goal. Shin Jae-wook showed a playful annoyance towards Daniel Van Buyten. \\"Daniel! You're going to tear my shirt.\\" \\"It's not torn, is it? And I had to stop you somehow, what else could I do?\\" \\"Let's play fair. We're teammates, aren't we?\\" \\"Hey! I'm stopping you because we're teammates. Don't I know your skills? If I tried to play fair, you'd break through and we'd concede a goal right away.\\" \\"Why are you like this when you're such a great defender?\\" \\"Great? I'm just an old player about to retire.\\" \\"Stop pretending to be weak.\\" \\"Jae-wook, how about showing some respect for the elderly? My knees and back are already aching from trying to stop you.\\" \\"Ha! You'll probably need to get some treatment at the hospital after today's game.\\" After a brief conversation, Shin Jae-wook fist-bumped Daniel Van Buyten and then picked up the ball. He intended to take the free kick himself. He liked both the distance and the position. It was a spot where he often scored free-kick goals during practice. - Shin Jae-wook is getting ready to take the free kick. He's really good at free kicks! - That's right. Shin Jae-wook has scored quite a few goals from free kicks in the Bundesliga, and he's also shown beautiful free-kick goals in the Champions League. That's why we're looking forward to it! If he scores a free-kick goal in a situation like this where the team is being pushed back, it will boost the confidence of our national team players even more, won't it? Shin Jae-wook quietly placed the ball down. He was focused solely on the free-kick situation. 'I have to score this.' It wasn't an opportunity that came easily, so he wanted to make the most of it. He wanted to score the free kick to break Belgium's momentum, even if just a little. Swoosh! Shin Jae-wook nodded to the referee, signaling that he was ready to take the shot. The referee blew the whistle, indicating that he could take the free kick. At that moment, everyone in the stadium focused on Shin Jae-wook's movement. At the same time, the Belgian players forming the defensive wall and Belgium's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois couldn't hide their tension. They all knew Shin Jae-wook's stature well. How good he was, how well he took free kicks, so they couldn't help but be nervous. That's when it happened. 'Huh?' Shin Jae-wook saw it. A gap had formed under the Belgian defensive wall. 'There's space there?' It wasn't a wide gap. Just a small gap that a ball could barely fit through. Putting the ball through there was a very difficult task. 'Let's try it.' Shin Jae-wook decided. He would shoot towards that gap. 'Great goals come from taking on challenges.' He moved towards the ball. Tap! Tap! With his unique rhythm, he gradually increased his speed. And finally, when he arrived in front of the ball. Shin Jae-wook swung his leg. Puhreung! A powerful sound of impact erupted. Belgium's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was tense, widened his eyes to follow the trajectory of the ball. However, he couldn't see the ball's path. Even after the time when it should have been visible, it wasn't there. \\"Ah!\\" Realizing something was off, Thibaut Courtois turned his head to look inside the goal. The ball, staying low, had already burrowed towards that spot. It was too late to leap for it. \\"Ugh!\\" Thibaut Courtois, frustrated, kicked the innocent grass. * * * Wow! A roar erupted in the stadium. A spectacular free-kick goal had just been scored on the spot. - Wow! It's in! Goal! Shin Jae-wook has scored from a free kick! - Wow...! He scored with a low shot? I didn't expect that at all. It seems Shin Jae-wook saw a gap that we couldn't see! Shall we watch the slow-motion replay? - If you look at the slow-motion replay, you can see there's a very slight gap in the wall formed by the Belgian players, right? Just enough space for a ball to fit through if it's hit low. And Shin Jae-wook's shot went precisely through that gap! - It's even more amazing to see it in slow motion. It's surprising enough that he thought to shoot through that narrow gap, but the fact that he succeeded is even more astonishing! Shin Jae-wook seems to have become a master of shooting! The cheers of the crowd didn't stop. Shin Jae-wook's name echoed throughout the stadium for showing such a high level of free-kick skill. \\"Did that really work?\\" He had attempted it as a surprise because he saw a gap in the defensive wall, but it turned out to be more successful than he thought. Although he wasn't showing it outwardly, honestly, Shin Jae-wook was also surprised. \\"That's why you take on challenges.\\" He felt good about scoring a great goal. He enjoyed seeing his teammates happier for him than he was for himself. However, his joy was short-lived, as Shin Jae-wook hardened his expression. He couldn't be happy anymore. Belgium was preparing to make a substitution. \\"It's going to get even harder.\\" He saw the faces of dangerous players. - Belgium is making a substitution! It's still early in the game, but they're already making a change? - It seems like they're determined not to lose to Korea! These players are coming on...! Two players were being substituted in. It was a surprising move. Usually, players aren't substituted in the first half, and it's rare to see two substitutions at once. \\"I'll have to run even harder.\\" Shin Jae-wook smiled bitterly as he swept back his sweat-soaked red hair."},{"prompt":"194 * * * 관중석이 웅성거렸다. 아직 전반전 37분인데도 불구하고, 벨기에가 선수를 교체했기 때문이었다. 게다가 1명이 아니고, 무려 2명이나. “뭐야? 2명을 교체한다고? 이렇게 빨리?” “벨기에가 제대로 할 생각인가 본데? 한국한테 2 대 1로 밀리고 있어서 화가 났나 봐.” “아무리 그래도 2명을 한 번에 교체한다고? 저건 웬만한 자신감이 없으면 하기 힘든 선택일 텐데.” “벨기에가 제대로 승부수를 띄웠구나!” 신재욱의 시선은 새로 들어오는 선수들에게로 향했다. “케빈 더브라위너, 드리스 메르턴스. 되게 잘하는 선수들이 들어오네.” 케빈 더브라위너는 아직 완전히 꽃피우지 않은 재능이었다. 하지만 환생을 한 신재욱은 알고 있었다. 케빈 더브라위너의 실력만큼은 지금 시기에도 거의 완성되어 있다는 것을. ‘다음 시즌에 볼프스부르크에서 활약하고, 그다음 시즌부터는 맨체스터 시티 FC에서 꾸준히 잘하며 월드클래스가 되는 선수지. 그리고 그렇게 가는 곳마다 빨리 적응하고 잘하는 것도 다 실력이 있어서 가능한 거야.’ 조심해야 하는 선수였다. 무서울 정도로 정확한 패스를 뿌려대는데, 많이 뛰며 수비 가담까지 잘하는 선수다. 게다가 슈팅도 매우 날카롭다. 한국의 수비진이 매우 막기 어려운 선수였다. 그리고 그와 함께 들어온 드리스 메르턴스 역시 굉장한 선수였다. ‘발이 빠르고, 드리블 실력이 엄청나게 좋은 선수지.’ 드리스 메르턴스의 드리블은 유럽의 수비수들에게도 매우 잘 통할 정도로 뛰어나다. 더군다나 그에겐 날카로운 슈팅 능력도 있었다. 즉, 빠르고 개인 기량이 뛰어난 선수에게 약한 모습을 보이는 한국 수비수들에겐 아주 위험한 선수였다. ― 케빈 더브라위너 선수와 드리스 메르턴스 선수를 투입했다는 건 벨기에가 더욱 공격적으로 경기 운영을 하겠다는 것이겠죠? ― 그렇습니다. 벨기에는 이제 더욱 공격적으로 하면서 골을 넣을 생각인 것 같습니다. 새로 투입된 두 명의 선수는 경기가 재개되자마자 자신들의 존재감을 확실하게 드러냈다. ― 케빈 더브라위너! 엄청난 패스입니다! 짧은 패스를 주고받던 케빈 더브라위너는 갑자기 전방을 향해 강력한 스루패스를 뿌려냈다. 한국의 수비수들이 전혀 눈치채지 못한 타이밍에 나온 패스였다. 그리고 그런 케빈 데브라위너의 패스를 받은 선수는 드리스 메르턴스였다. 단숨에 뒷공간을 내준 한국 수비수들은 깜짝 놀라며 복귀하려 했지만. 드리스 메르턴스는 이미 한국의 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 상태였고, 슈팅까지 때려내고 있었다. 퍼엉! 드리스 메르턴스는 훌륭한 킥력을 지닌 선수답게, 골망을 찢을듯한 강력한 슈팅으로 정석룡 골키퍼를 뚫어냈다. ― 아…… 들어갔습니다…! 벨기에의 드리스 메르턴스 선수가 동점 골을 터트렸습니다! ― 벨기에의 선수 교체가 제대로 먹혀들었네요. 새로 투입된 케빈 더브라위너 선수와 드리스 메르턴스 선수가 골을 만들어냈습니다. 그때였다. 동점 골을 터트린 드리스 메르턴스가 골대 안에 있는 공을 들어 올렸다. 그리고 경기장 중앙으로 달리기 시작했다. 그 모습을 본 벨기에의 팬들이 웃음을 터트렸다. “푸하하! 저거 한국의 신재욱 세리머니 따라 하는 거 맞지?” “맞는 것 같은데? 큭큭큭큭! 드리스 메르턴스 저 녀석, 되게 웃긴 놈이라니까?” “하하하! 한국팬들은 열받겠는데?” “신재욱이 가장 화나지 않을까?” 경기를 보는 사람들 대부분은 눈치챌 수 있었다. 드리스 메르턴스가 신재욱의 세리머니를 따라 하는 것이라는 걸. 그리고 그런 모습을 실시간으로 바라보는 한국 축구팬들은 화를 참지 못했다. └ 저 새끼 뭔데 신재욱을 도발하냐? 드리스 메르턴스? 듣보잡 아님??? └ 솔직히 까놓고 말해서 듣보잡은 아니야. 나폴리에서 잘하고 있는 선수거든. 근데 그래도 우리 재욱신은 건들면 안 되지!!!! └ 왜 도발을 하고 난리야? 짜증 나게. └ 아…… 이 경기는 꼭 이겼으면 좋겠다. 도발은 신재욱이 당했는데, 내가 다 자존심이 상하네. └ 아오!!!!! 우리 수비수들 도대체 뭐하냐고!!! 자동문처럼 뚫리니까 저딴 도발이나 당하지!!!! └ 드리스 메르턴스인지 메르텐스인지 뒤지고 싶냐!!! 경기장에 있던 한국 축구팬들도 마찬가지였다. 이들은 경기장 중앙으로 뛰는 드리스 메르턴스를 향해 야유를 보냈다. 그러나 야유는 잘 들리지 않았다. 벨기에 팬들이 만들어낸 함성의 크기가 더 컸으니까. 같은 시각. 도발을 당한 당사자인 신재욱은 아무렇지 않았다. 그는 드리스 메르턴스의 도발을 전혀 신경 쓰지 않고 있었다. 오로지 경기에서 승리할 방법에 대해서만 생각하고 있었다. ‘뒷공간을 너무 쉽게 내주는 경향이 있어. 이럴 바엔 차라리 라인을 내리는 게 낫겠는데?’ 신재욱이 홍정태 감독을 바라봤다. 다행히 홍정태 감독은 이미 수비수들에게 라인을 내리라는 지시를 내리고 있었다. ‘좋은 판단이야. 지금 같은 상황에선 차라리 라인을 내려서 뒷공간을 내주지 않는 게 더 안전해.’ 그때였다. 근처에 있던 이택현이 말을 걸어왔다. “재욱아, 드리스 메르턴스가 너 도발하는 거 봤지?” “어. 봤어.” “내가 골 넣어서 복수해줄게.” “난 아무렇지 않은데 네가 왜 복수를 해?” “넌 아무렇지 않을 수 있어도 나는 아니야. 내가 골 넣고 저놈 앞에 가서 제대로 도발할 거야.” “카드 받을 정도로는 하지 말고.” “당연하지. 전반전은 거의 다 끝났으니까 후반전 들어가서 보여줄게.” “기대할게.” 신재욱은 작게 웃음을 터트렸다. 굳이 이택현을 말리지 않았다. 어찌 됐건 골을 넣으면 팀에게 좋은 일이니까. 동료의 동기 부여를 사그라뜨릴 필요는 없었다. ‘근데 진짜 골 넣고 카드 받는 거 아니야?’ * * * 경기가 재개된 이후, 전반전은 금방 끝이 났다. 선수들 모두 휴식을 취한 뒤, 후반전을 위해서 다시 경기장에 입장했다. 그 과정에서 드리스 메르턴스가 도발을 해왔다. “이봐, 신재욱! 내 세리머니 어땠어?” 그는 굳이 세리머니에 관해서 물어보며 얄미운 표정을 지었다. 신재욱은 심드렁한 표정으로 대답했다. “멋있던데?” “하하하! 네 걸 따라 했다고 멋있다고 해주는 거야?” “알아서 생각해.” “너무 까칠한 거 아니야? 설마 화났어? 내가 네 세리머니를 따라 해서 화난 거야? 아니지?” 드리스 메르턴스는 계속해서 말을 걸며 깝죽거렸지만, 신재욱은 상대해주지 않았다. 손을 휘휘 내저으며 깔끔하게 무시해버렸다. ‘너랑 떠들어줄 여유가 없어.’ 드리스 메르턴스의 도발은 신재욱에게 전혀 영향이 없었다. 현재 신재욱의 머릿속은 너무 복잡해서 같잖은 도발이 파고들 틈이 없었다. ‘생각하자. 어떻게 하면 벨기에를 잘 공략할 수 있을까.’ 신재욱은 승리할 방법에 대해서 끊임없이 고민 중이었다. 수비는 마음을 내려놓았다. 든든해서가 아니었다. 너무 불안해서 그냥 신경을 쓰지 않기로 했다. 지금은 어떻게 하면 효과적으로 벨기에를 공략하고, 여러 개의 골을 넣을 수 있을 것인가에 대해서만 생각했다. 생각은 길게 이어지지 못했다. 후반전이 시작됐으니까. ― 전반전에 2 대 2 동점으로 치열한 경기를 펼친 대한민국과 벨기에! 두 팀 중 승리할 팀이 이번 후반전에는 가려지게 됩니다! 신재욱은 생각을 비웠다. 단, 이길 방법만큼은 확실하게 생각해냈다. ‘내가 더 잘해주면 돼.’ 자신이 더 잘해서 벨기에의 수비를 흔들고, 직접 골을 넣거나 동료에게 골 기회를 만들어주는 것. 그걸 반복해서 실점보다 득점을 더 많게 하는 것. 단순하지만, 결국 그게 승리를 위한 방법이었다. 하지만 쉬운 방법은 아니었다. ― 신재욱 선수에게 공이 잘 안 가네요. 우리 선수들이 벨기에의 강한 압박 때문에 신재욱 선수에게 공을 연결하지 못하고 있습니다. ― 벨기에 선수들은 정말 잘하네요. 잘 보시면 이 선수들은 신재욱 선수에게 공이 흐르는 걸 철저하게 경계하고 있지 않습니까? 한국의 공격은 신재욱 선수를 거쳤을 때 가장 강한데, 그런 상황을 만들지 못하게 하고 있습니다. 벨기에는 신재욱이 공을 잡지 못하게끔 필사적으로 막고 있었다. 그러나 신재욱은 수많은 경험이 있는 선수답게 답을 찾아냈다. 상대 선수들의 압박을 피해내며 밑으로 내려가서 공을 받아냈다. 툭! 툭! 동료들과 원터치 패스로 공을 주고받던 신재욱은 갑자기 몸을 틀며 공을 강하게 차 냈다. 퍼어엉! 측면으로 뿌려주는 패스였다. 오프더볼 상황에서 침투가 좋은 손훈민을 정확히 노린 패스였다. 벨기에의 미드필더 무사 뎀벨레는 패스를 끊어내기 위해서 발을 뻗어봤지만, 역부족이었다. 끊어내기엔 신재욱의 패스 타이밍이 너무 빨랐다. ― 신재욱! 좋은 패스입니다! 손훈민이 잡습니다! 손훈민은 킥 능력이 매우 뛰어난 선수였다. 많은 축구팬들은 이 선수가 슈팅 능력만 뛰어나다고 생각하지만, 사실은 패스 능력도 꽤나 좋은 선수였다. 지금도 그랬다. 양발을 모두 잘 쓰는 손훈민은 벨기에의 측면수비수 반덴 보레를 헛다리 짚기로 제쳐낸 뒤, 정교한 크로스까지 뿌려냈다. 벨기에의 페널티박스 안엔 스트라이커인 신재욱이 없었지만, 문제는 없었다. 190cm에 가까운 큰 키를 지녔고, 놀라운 신체 능력까지 지닌 이택현이 있었으니까. 터어엉! 빠르게 침투하며 점프한 이택현은 이마로 날아오는 공을 찍어 내렸다. 벨기에의 수비수 니콜라스 롬바르츠가 막아보려고 했지만, 이택현의 움직임이 너무 빨랐다. 철썩! 벨기에의 골망이 크게 흔들렸다. 워낙 강력한 헤더였기에, 벨기에의 골키퍼 티보 쿠르투아는 반응조차 하지 못했다. ― 고오오오오오오오오올! 우와아아아아~! 이택현 선수의 골입니다! 완벽한 헤딩이었습니다! ― 손훈민 선수의 크로스도 매우 좋았고, 이택현 선수의 움직임과 헤더 모두 완벽했네요! 또다시 벨기에의 수비를 뚫어내는 대한민국입니다! 그때였다. 골을 넣은 이택현이 어딘가로 달려가기 시작했다. 그리고 그런 이택현을 향해 신재욱이 크게 소리쳤다. “택현아! 카드 안 받을 정도로만!” 다행히 대답은 들려왔다. “걱정하지 마!” 이택현의 목적지는 드리스 메르턴스의 앞이었다. 그곳에 도착하자마자 이택현은 백덤블링을 하기 시작했다. 총 3번의 백덤블링. 누가 봐도 상대를 도발하는 행동이었다. ― 하하하하! 이택현 선수! 드리스 메르턴스 선수 앞에서 백덤블링 세리머니를 하네요? 이건…… 조금 전에 신재욱 선수의 세리머니를 따라 하며 도발했던 것에 대한 보복성 세리머니 같죠? ― 하하! 아마 그런 것 같습니다. 신재욱 선수와 워낙 친한 이택현 선수니까요. 그리고 강렬한 이택현의 도발에 벨기에의 선수들은 흥분할 수밖에 없었다. 얼굴이 붉어진 이들은 이택현에게 화를 냈고, 주심은 빠르게 상황을 정리했다. “이택현! 한 번만 더 이런 행동을 하면 카드를 줄 거야. 알겠어?” “조심하겠습니다! 너그럽게 봐주셔서 감사합니다!” 주심의 경고를 받은 이택현은 능글맞게 대답하며 몸을 돌렸다. 그러고는 크게 소리를 질렀다. 신재욱을 향해서. “재욱아! 이 이택현 님께서 복수해줬다! 봤어? 이 이택현 님이 드리스 메르턴스 앞에서 슈퍼 파워 3연속 백덤블링 한 거 봤냐고!” 목소리가 어찌나 큰지 이택현이 한 말은 TV로 경기를 보던 축구팬들에게까지 정확히 들렸다. 한국의 각종 포털사이트엔 실시간으로 이택현의 이름이 올라가기 시작했다. 댓글 창도 폭발적이었다. 한국 축구팬들은 이택현의 특이한 성격에 대해서 떠들며 웃음을 터트렸다. 경기장에 있던 한국 축구팬들 역시 커다란 웃음을 터트리며 즐거워했다. 오직 신재욱만 웃지 못하고 있었다. “행동은 저 친구가 했는데, 이상하게 내가 더 창피하네.” 그렇게 중얼거린 신재욱은 머리 색만큼이나 붉어진 얼굴로 고개를 숙였다.","completion":"194 * * * The stands were buzzing. Despite it being only the 37th minute of the first half, Belgium had made a substitution, and not just one player, but two. \\"What? They're substituting two players? This early?\\" \\"Looks like Belgium is serious about this. They must be angry about being behind 2-1 to Korea.\\" \\"Even so, to substitute two players at once? That's a choice you can't make without a lot of confidence.\\" \\"Belgium is really playing their cards!\\" Shin Jae-wook's gaze was fixed on the new players entering the game. \\"Kevin De Bruyne, Dries Mertens. Really good players are coming in.\\" Kevin De Bruyne was a talent that hadn't fully blossomed yet. However, Shin Jae-wook, who had been reincarnated, knew. He knew that Kevin De Bruyne's skills were nearly complete even at this point in time. 'Next season he'll shine at Wolfsburg, and from the following season, he'll consistently perform well at Manchester City FC and become a world-class player. And the ability to quickly adapt and perform well wherever he goes is all due to his talent.' He was a player to be cautious of. He was terrifyingly accurate with his passes, ran a lot, and even contributed well to defense. Plus, his shooting was very sharp. He was a very difficult player for the Korean defense to handle. And Dries Mertens, who came in with him, was also an incredible player. 'He's fast, and his dribbling skills are incredibly good.' Dries Mertens' dribbling was so good that it worked very well against European defenders. Moreover, he also had a sharp shooting ability. In other words, he was a very dangerous player for the Korean defenders, who showed weakness against fast and technically skilled players. - By bringing in Kevin De Bruyne and Dries Mertens, Belgium seems to be planning to play more offensively, right? - That's right. Belgium now seems to be thinking of scoring more goals by being more aggressive. The two newly introduced players immediately made their presence felt as soon as the game resumed. - Kevin De Bruyne! What an incredible pass! While exchanging short passes, Kevin De Bruyne suddenly sent a powerful through pass forward. It was a pass that came at a timing that the Korean defenders completely missed. And the player who received Kevin De Bruyne's pass was Dries Mertens. The Korean defenders, who had given up the backspace too easily, were shocked and tried to recover. But Dries Mertens was already penetrating into Korea's penalty box and was taking a shot. Puhreung! Dries Mertens, true to his excellent kicking ability, pierced through goalkeeper Jung Seok-ryong with a powerful shot that seemed to tear the net. - Ah... It's in...! Belgium's Dries Mertens has scored the equalizing goal! - Belgium's substitution has paid off. The newly introduced Kevin De Bruyne and Dries Mertens have created a goal. That's when it happened. Dries Mertens, who had scored the equalizing goal, picked up the ball inside the goal. And he started running towards the center of the field. Belgian fans burst into laughter at the sight. \\"Hahaha! Is he imitating Shin Jae-wook's celebration?\\" \\"It looks like it, right? Kukukukuk! Dries Mertens, that guy, is really funny, isn't he?\\" \\"Haha! The Korean fans must be furious, right?\\" \\"Isn't Shin Jae-wook the one who's most angry?\\" Most people watching the game could tell. Dries Mertens was imitating Shin Jae-wook's celebration. And Korean football fans watching in real-time couldn't contain their anger. └ What's that guy doing provoking Shin Jae-wook? Dries Mertens? Some nobody??? └ Honestly, he's not a nobody. He's doing well at Napoli. But still, you can't mess with our Jae-wook Shin!!!! └ Why is he provoking and making a fuss? It's annoying. └ Ah... I really hope we win this game. The provocation was aimed at Shin Jae-wook, but my pride is hurt. └ Ahhh!!!!! What the hell are our defenders doing!!! They're getting breached like automatic doors, and that's why we're getting provoked!!!! └ Does Dries Mertens want to die or what!!! Korean football fans in the stadium felt the same way. They jeered at Dries Mertens as he ran towards the center of the field. However, the jeers were not well heard. The cheers from the Belgian fans were louder. At the same time. Shin Jae-wook, the target of the provocation, was unfazed. He didn't care about Dries Mertens' taunts at all. He was only thinking about how to win the game. 'We're giving up the backspace too easily. Maybe it's better to drop the line?' Shin Jae-wook looked at Coach Hong Jeong-tae. Fortunately, Coach Hong was already instructing the defenders to drop back. 'That's a good decision. In the current situation, it's safer to drop the line and not give up the backspace.' That's when it happened. Lee Taek-hyun, who was nearby, spoke to him. \\"Jae-wook, did you see Dries Mertens provoking you?\\" \\"Yeah, I saw it.\\" \\"I'll score a goal and get revenge for you.\\" \\"Why do you need to get revenge when I'm not bothered?\\" \\"Even if you're not bothered, I am. I'll score a goal and go right in front of that guy and properly provoke him.\\" \\"Just don't get a card for it.\\" \\"Of course. The first half is almost over, so I'll show him in the second half.\\" \\"I'll be looking forward to it.\\" Shin Jae-wook chuckled softly. He didn't try to stop Lee Taek-hyun. After all, scoring a goal would be good for the team. There was no need to dampen his teammate's motivation. 'But are you really going to score and not get a card?' * * * After the game resumed, the first half soon ended. The players all took a break and then re-entered the field for the second half. During this process, Dries Mertens provoked Shin Jae-wook. \\"Hey, Shin Jae-wook! How was my celebration?\\" He deliberately asked about the celebration with a smug expression. Shin Jae-wook responded with an indifferent expression. \\"It was cool.\\" \\"Hahaha! You're saying it was cool because I imitated your celebration?\\" \\"Think what you want.\\" \\"Aren't you being too prickly? Are you angry? Are you mad because I imitated your celebration? No, right?\\" Dries Mertens kept talking and teasing, but Shin Jae-wook didn't engage. He waved his hand dismissively and ignored him completely. 'I don't have the luxury to chat with you.' Dries Mertens' provocation had no effect on Shin Jae-wook. His mind was too preoccupied with complex thoughts for such petty provocations to penetrate. 'Think. How can we effectively attack Belgium?' Shin Jae-wook was constantly pondering how to win. He had let go of worrying about defense. Not because it was reliable, but because it was so uncertain that he decided not to focus on it. Now, he was only thinking about how to effectively attack Belgium and score multiple goals. His thoughts didn't last long. The second half had started. - South Korea and Belgium, who played a fierce 2-2 draw in the first half, will now see which team will emerge victorious in this second half! Shin Jae-wook cleared his mind. However, he had a clear idea of how to win. 'I just need to do better.' He had to play better to shake Belgium's defense, score goals himself, or create opportunities for his teammates. Repeat that to score more goals than concede. It was simple, but ultimately, that was the way to win. But it wasn't an easy method. - Shin Jae-wook isn't getting the ball much. Our players can't connect with him due to Belgium's strong pressure. - The Belgian players are really good. If you look closely, they're thoroughly guarding against the ball flowing to Shin Jae-wook, aren't they? Korea's attack is strongest when it goes through Shin Jae-wook, but they're preventing that situation from happening. Belgium was desperately trying to prevent Shin Jae-wook from getting the ball. However, Shin Jae-wook, with his vast experience, found a solution. He avoided the pressure from the opposing players and dropped back to receive the ball. Tuk! Tuk! While exchanging one-touch passes with his teammates, Shin Jae-wook suddenly twisted his body and kicked the ball powerfully. Puhreung! It was a pass to the side. It was a precise pass aimed at Son Heung-min, who was good at off-the-ball movements. Belgium's midfielder Musa Dembélé tried to intercept the pass by stretching out his foot, but it was in vain. The timing of Shin Jae-wook's pass was too fast. - Shin Jae-wook! What a good pass! Son Heung-min catches it! Son Heung-min was a player with excellent kicking ability. Many football fans think he's only good at shooting, but in fact, he's also quite good at passing. It was the same now. Son Heung-min, who could use both feet well, fooled Belgium's side-back Vanden Borre with a feint and then delivered a precise cross. There was no striker Shin Jae-wook in Belgium's penalty box, but that wasn't a problem. Lee Taek-hyun was there, nearly 190cm tall and with astonishing physical abilities. Tuhreung! Lee Taek-hyun, who had penetrated quickly and jumped, headed the incoming ball downwards. Belgium's defender Nicolas Lombaerts tried to block it, but Lee Taek-hyun's movement was too fast. Thwack! Belgium's net shook greatly. The header was so powerful that Belgium's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois couldn't even react. - Goal! Wow! It's a goal by Lee Taek-hyun! A perfect header! - Son Heung-min's cross was very good, and Lee Taek-hyun's movement and header were perfect! South Korea has breached Belgium's defense once again! That's when it happened. Lee Taek-hyun, who had scored the goal, started running somewhere. And Shin Jae-wook shouted loudly at him. \\"Taek-hyun! Just don't get a card!\\" Fortunately, a response came back. \\"Don't worry!\\" Lee Taek-hyun's destination was right in front of Dries Mertens. As soon as he arrived, Lee Taek-hyun started doing backflips. A total of three backflips. It was an action that was clearly meant to provoke the opponent. - Hahaha! Lee Taek-hyun! He's doing backflip celebrations right in front of Dries Mertens? This seems like... a retaliatory celebration for the earlier imitation of Shin Jae-wook's celebration, right? - Haha! It seems so. Lee Taek-hyun is very close to Shin Jae-wook after all. And with Lee Taek-hyun's intense provocation, the Belgian players couldn't help but get excited. Their faces turned red with anger, and the referee quickly defused the situation. \\"Lee Taek-hyun! If you do this kind of action one more time, I'll give you a card. Understand?\\" \\"I'll be careful! Thank you for being lenient!\\" After receiving the referee's warning, Lee Taek-hyun cheekily replied and turned around. Then he shouted loudly. At Shin Jae-wook. \\"Jae-wook! This Lee Taek-hyun has avenged you! Did you see? This Lee Taek-hyun did a super power triple backflip right in front of Dries Mertens!\\" His voice was so loud that even football fans watching the game on TV could hear Lee Taek-hyun's words clearly. Lee Taek-hyun's name began to trend in real-time on various Korean portal sites. The comment sections exploded. Korean football fans laughed and talked about Lee Taek-hyun's unique personality. Korean fans in the stadium also burst into laughter and enjoyed the moment. Only Shin Jae-wook couldn't laugh. \\"It's weird that I feel more embarrassed when he's the one who did it.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jae-wook bowed his head, his face as red as the color of his hair."},{"prompt":"195 * * * 스코어를 3 대 2로 만드는 이택현의 골. 그 골은 한국 축구팬들이 함성을 지르게 했다. 이어서 나온 이택현의 보복성 백덤블링 세리머니에도 커다란 환호성이 터져 나왔다. 그러나 환호성은 길게 이어지지 않았다. 관중석에서 경기를 지켜보던 한국 축구팬들과 TV로 보던 한국 축구팬들 모두 웃음을 터트리기 시작했다. 자신이 복수해줬다고 신재욱에게 자랑하는 이택현의 행동 때문이었다. └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이택현 쟤 돌아이 아님?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 대놓고 복수했다고 말하네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그리고 목청은 또 왜 저렇게 커? └ 이택현은 진짜 이상하다니까ㅋㅋㅋ 왜 상대 선수 앞에 가서 백덤블링을 하는 거야?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ못 들었어? 메르턴스가 신재욱 세리머니 따라 했다고 복수해줬다잖아ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개웃겨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이택현 쟤 신재욱한테 자랑하는 것 좀 봐ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 근데 신재욱은 창피해함ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 저런 거 보면 이택현이 어리다는 게 보임ㅋㅋㅋ 덩치만 컸지 걍 애네ㅋㅋㅋ └ 한국 나이로 20살이니까 어리지. 근데 진짜 특이한 성격이긴 한 듯ㅋㅋㅋ 같은 시각. 신재욱은 관중석에서 끊이지 않고 터져 나오는 웃음소리를 들으며, 숙였던 고개를 들었다. 붉어졌던 얼굴이 간신히 원래대로 돌아왔다. “부끄러움은 나의 몫인가?” 이택현의 이상한 행동은 오래 봐왔음에도 도저히 익숙해지지 않았다. 매번 당황스러웠다. 특히 지금처럼 상대 선수 앞으로 달려가서 백덤블링을 하는 행동은 더더욱 당황스럽다. 하지만 어찌 됐건 결과는 좋았다. 이택현의 골로 스코어는 3 대 2가 됐고, 한국 대표팀 선수들은 정신적으로 큰 힘을 얻었다. “택현이 골 덕분에 3 대 2가 됐어! 충분히 이길 수 있으니까 조금만 더 힘내자!” “집중하면 막을 수 있어! 쟤들 드리블에 쫄지 말고, 쉽게 발 뻗지 마! 그냥 최대한 슈팅각이랑 돌파각만 안 주면서 천천히 막아보자!” “벨기에의 공격이 무섭긴 하지만, 그럴수록 우리도 더 공격을 시도해야 해. 그래야 이길 수 있어.” “공격이 최고의 방어라는 거죠? 인정!” 전력에서 훨씬 강하다고 평가받던 벨기에를 이길 수 있다는 희망도 생겼다. 그때였다. 신재욱도 손뼉을 크게 치며 대표팀 동료들에게 소리쳤다. “다들 잘하고 있어요! 우리 이길 수 있으니까 더 자신감 있게 하죠!” 이처럼 한국 대표팀이 기세를 높이고 있을 때. 벨기에의 분위기는 달아오르고 있었다. 이들은 분위기를 주도하던 상황에서 오히려 한국에게 골을 허용해버렸기에 자존심이 상한 상태였다. “빨리 골 넣어서 동점 만들고, 스코어 차이도 크게 벌려버리자. 쟤들 공격력은 세서 우리도 이기려면 골을 많이 넣어야 해.” “신재욱이랑 이택현이 너무 잘해서 골을 안 먹히긴 어려울 것 같고, 쟤들 수비가 약하니까 더 과감하게 공격해보자.” “정신 좀 차리자! 한국한테 질 순 없잖아?” “우리가 한국 대표팀한테 3 대 2로 밀리고 있네. 이거 꿈은 아니지? 창피해서 죽을 것 같으니까 빨리 골 넣자.” 벨기에 선수들은 집중력을 높였다. 이대로라면 정말 질 수도 있겠다는 생각이 벨기에 선수들에겐 커다란 동기 부여가 된 것이다. ― 뭔가 벨기에 선수들의 연계가 부드러워진 것 같지 않습니까? 움직임도 더 날카로워졌고요. ― 정말 그렇네요. 대단합니다. 스코어에서 밀리게 되면서 마음이 급해질 만도 한데, 벨기에 선수들의 움직임을 보면 급하다는 느낌은 전혀 들지 않습니다. 분명 경기 템포는 높인 것 같은데 말이죠. 벨기에의 공격진을 이루고 있는 로멜루 루카쿠, 드리스 메르턴스, 에덴 아자르와 미드필더진을 마루앙 펠라이니, 무사 뎀벨레, 케빈 더브라위너. 이들은 무서울 정도로 정확한 패스를 주고받으며 한국 대표팀을 압박했다. 한국 선수들이 적극적으로 압박을 시도하고 있지만, 공을 뺏어내기엔 역부족이었다. 선수들 개개인 모두 탈압박이 좋은 벨기에를 상대로 공을 뺏는 건 원래도 어려운데, 지금은 벨기에 선수들 모두 동기 부여가 확실하게 되며 높은 집중력을 유지하고 있었으니까. ― 드리스 메르턴스! 엄청난 드리블이네요! 윤성영과 기석용 두 명을 상대하면서도 기어코 돌파해냈습니다! ― 전반전에 교체되어 들어온 이유가 있네요. 드리스 메르턴스 선수, 우리 수비를 위협하고 있습니다. 드리스 메르턴스는 뛰어난 드리블러답게 한국 선수 2명을 상대로도 피하지 않고 돌파를 선택했고, 성공해냈다. ― 막아야 합니다! 드리스 메르턴스 선수는 슈팅도 강력한 선수라는 걸 잊어선 안 됩니다! 한국의 수비진은 깜짝 놀라며 진열을 재정비했다. 다급한 정비였지만, 대응은 나쁘지 않았다. 특히 중앙수비수 홍정오는 빠르게 각을 좁히며 드리스 메르턴스가 장기인 오른발 슈팅을 때리지 못하게끔 방해했다. 그러나 문제가 있었다. 벨기에 대표팀엔 슈팅 능력이 좋은 선수가 매우 많다는 것이었다. 툭! 드리스 메르턴스는 기다렸다는 듯 뒤로 공을 뺐다. 뒤에서 달려오는 동료라면 충분히 골을 넣어줄 것이란 믿음이 있었다. “케빈, 네 거야.” 케빈 더브라위너. 세계적인 수준의 선수들이 득실득실한 벨기에 대표팀 내에서도 가장 킥이 좋은 선수. 그가 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. 드리스 메르턴스가 흘려준 공은 슈팅하기에 아주 좋았고, 케빈 더브라위너는 그 기회를 놓치지 않았다. 퍼어엉! 제대로 맞은 슈팅이었다. 킥이 강력하고, 정확도가 높은 케빈 더브라위너가 때려낸 공. 그 공은 한국의 골대 상단 구석으로 너무나도 날카롭게 휘어져 들어갔다. 오늘 좋은 선방을 여러 번 보여줬던 정석룡 골키퍼가 기민하게 몸을 날리며 팔을 뻗었지만. 크게 휘어져 들어가는 공을 건드리지 못했다. 우와아아아아! 벨기에의 골을 기다렸던 관중들이 환호성을 내질렀다. 이들은 잔뜩 흥분한 채 케빈 더브라위너의 이름을 연호했다. ― 케빈 더브라위너! 엄청난 슈팅으로 골을 집어넣습니다! 벨기에, 정말 무섭네요! 경기는 이제 3 대 3 동점이 됐습니다! ― 벨기에 선수들이 지난 경기들보다 더 강력한 경기력을 보여주는 것 같은데요? 이 선수들 정말 이기고 싶은 모양입니다. ― 벨기에의 팬들도 엄청난 환호를 보내고 있습니다. 16강행을 확정했음에도 팬들의 응원이 장난이 아니네요. ― 하하! 이 경기는 벨기에의 팬들에게도 자존심이 걸린 경기일 테니까요. 3 대 3 동점을 만든 이후. 벨기에는 계속해서 공격을 시도하며 한국을 위협했다. ― 에덴 아자르! 공을 뺏기질 않습니다! 양쪽 측면에선 에덴 아자르와 드리스 메르턴스가 뛰어난 드리블 실력을 발휘하며 한국의 수비를 흔들었고. ― 로멜루 루카쿠! 이 선수를 막으려면 최소한 2명을 붙어줘야 할 것 같습니다! ― 홍정오 선수와 김영원 선수도 몸싸움에서 쉽게 밀리는 선수가 아닌데, 로멜루 루카쿠 선수 앞에선 거의 튕겨 나가고 있습니다. 로멜루 루카쿠는 특유의 피지컬을 이용해 한국의 센터백들을 괴롭혔다. 게다가 벨기에는 체력이 떨어진 로멜루 루카쿠 대신 디보크 오리기를 투입하며 더욱 공격을 강화했다. 새로 투입된 디보크 오리기 역시 뛰어난 피지컬로 한국의 수비를 괴롭혔다. 이처럼 계속해서 밀리다 보니 한국의 공격 기회는 생기지 않았다. 막는 것만으로도 정신이 없었다. 그래서일까? 어느새 신재욱까지 밑으로 내려와 수비에 가담하고 있었다. 심지어 신재욱은 몸을 날리는 태클로 벨기에의 좋은 슈팅을 막아내기까지 했다. ― 신재욱 선수! 수비 가담이 굉장히 좋습니다! 정말 팀을 위해서 희생하는 플레이를 망설임 없이 해주네요! ― 신재욱 선수는 오늘 2골이나 넣은 스트라이커이면서 골이나 다름없던 벨기에의 슈팅까지 막아주네요! 너무나도 든든합니다! 해설들의 칭찬이 쏟아졌지만. 정작 신재욱의 표정은 굳어있었다. ‘벨기에의 공격이 매섭네. 팀이 밀리는 흐름을 한 번 뚫어줘야 하는데, 쉽지 않아.’ 계속해서 상대의 실수를 기다리고 있지만, 벨기에의 선수들은 영악했다. 공격을 시도하면서도 라인을 잘 유지했고 실수도 없었다. 겉으론 과감하게 드리블 돌파를 하는 것 같지만, 한 선수가 드리블할 때마다 다른 한 선수가 뒤에서 꼭 지원을 해줬다. 그때였다. 한국의 골문을 계속해서 두드리던 벨기에가 기어코 골을 터트렸다. 신재욱이 손쓸 수 없는 위치에서 나온 골이었다. ― 들어갔습니다…! ― 아…! 교체되어 투입된 디보크 오리기가 골을 넣어주네요. 케빈 더브라위너 선수의 어시스트입니다! ― 케빈 더브라위너 선수가 뒤로 돌아 들어가는 디보크 오리기 선수를 정확히 보고 줬네요. 상대 팀이지만, 아름다운 골입니다. 케빈 더브라위너의 넓은 시야와 정확도 높은 패스가 빛난 장면이었다. 페널티박스 안쪽으로 침투하는 디보크 오리기를 향해 얼리크로스를 뿌렸고, 디보크 오리기는 머리로 공을 건드리며 방향을 바꿔놨다. ― 디보크 오리기 선수의 골로 스코어는 4 대 3이 됩니다. 오늘 골이 굉장히 많이 나오네요. ― 그만큼 양 팀의 화력이 강력하다는 거겠죠. 더 흥미로운 건 지금 스코어로 끝나지 않을 것 같다는 겁니다. 적어도 2골은 더 나올 분위기이지 않습니까? ― 그렇습니다. 양 팀 선수들 모두 이대로 끝낼 생각이 없는 것 같습니다. 두 팀 모두 기회가 생기면 굉장히 공격적으로 플레이하고 있지 않습니까? 그리고 이왕이면 골을 넣는 팀이 우리 대한민국이었으면 좋겠네요. 디보크 오리기에게 골을 허용하며 3 대 4로 밀리게 된 상황. 한국은 동점 골을 만들기 위해 라인을 올리며 패스를 주고받았다. 하지만 그 과정은 쉽지 않았다. 강하게 들어오는 벨기에의 압박 때문이었다. 중원의 중심에 있는 기석용의 탈압박이 괜찮은 편이지만, 벨기에 선수 2명을 상대로 안정감을 유지할 수 있는 정도는 아니었다. 또 다른 미드필더 김국영은 탈압박이 그다지 좋은 선수가 아니었다. 당연히 벨기에의 압박을 이겨내고 전진 패스를 뿌리는 건 어려웠다. 그때였다. “공격진들 다 밑으로 내려가서 받아줘요!” 신재욱이 공격진을 진두지휘했다. 지금과 같은 상황에선 위에서 공을 받으려고 하면 오히려 역습을 허용할 수 있기에, 내려가서 공을 받아주는 게 최선의 판단이었다. 밑으로 내려가서 공을 받아주다 보면 체력 소모가 클 수밖에 없지만, 현재 한국 공격진의 체력엔 문제가 없었다. 플레이 특성상 체력 소모가 큰 손훈민 대신 구자천이 교체 투입됐고, 많이 지친 이청영 대신 지동운이 투입됐기 때문이었다. 더구나 신재욱과 이택현의 체력은 한국 대표팀 내에서 강철이라는 소리를 들을 정도로 강력했다. 후반전이었지만, 이 둘은 여전히 쌩쌩하게 뛰어다니고 있었다. “하나 만들어보죠! 조금만 더 힘내요!” 신재욱은 상대 선수들에게 집중 견제를 받으면서도 계속해서 소리치며 팀의 기세를 북돋웠다. ‘한 번이면 돼. 한 번만 기회가 오면 살릴 수 있어.’ 벨기에의 수비진은 신재욱이 공을 만지지도 못하게끔 철저히 방해했다. 선수 한 명이 맨투맨 마크를 하는 건 당연했고, 신재욱이 패스를 받으려고 할 때면 순간적으로 2~3명이 달라붙었다. 공을 잡는 것 자체가 힘든 상황. 그러나 신재욱은 계속해서 움직이며 공을 받으려고 했다. 마침내 바디페인팅을 이용해 잠깐이지만 2명의 선수를 떨어뜨린 신재욱은 공을 만질 수 있었다. 기석용이 낮고 빠르게 뿌려준 패스. 그 공을 신재욱은 잡아두지 않고, 곧바로 툭― 차 냈다. 오랜만에 공을 만질 기회였지만 욕심을 내지 않았다. 목적은 골이었기에, 더 좋은 위치에 있는 동료를 봤다. ― 신재욱 선수의 패스입니다! 신재욱이 스핀을 먹여 차낸 공은 벨기에의 페널티박스 안으로 휘어져 들어갔다. 그리고 그 공을 향해 한 선수가 달려들었다. ‘복수해준 보답이다. 택현아.’","completion":"195 * * * Lee Taek-hyun's goal made the score 3-2. His goal caused Korean football fans to scream with excitement. The subsequent retaliatory backflip celebration by Lee Taek-hyun also elicited a huge cheer. However, the cheering didn't last long. Korean football fans in the stands and those watching on TV began to laugh. They were amused by Lee Taek-hyun's behavior, boasting to Shin Jae-wook that he had avenged him. └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Is Lee Taek-hyun crazy?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He's openly saying he got revengeㅋㅋㅋㅋ And why is his voice so loud? └ Lee Taek-hyun is really weirdㅋㅋㅋ Why is he doing backflips in front of the opposing player?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Didn't you hear? He said he got revenge because Mertens imitated Shin Jae-wook's celebrationㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ So funnyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Look at Lee Taek-hyun bragging to Shin Jae-wookㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ But Shin Jae-wook is embarrassedㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ That's how you can tell Lee Taek-hyun is youngㅋㅋㅋ He's just a big kidㅋㅋㅋ └ He's only 20 years old in Korean age, so he's young. But he really does have a unique personalityㅋㅋㅋ At the same time. Shin Jae-wook, hearing the continuous laughter from the stands, raised his head that he had bowed. His face had finally returned to its normal color. \\"Is the embarrassment all mine?\\" Lee Taek-hyun's strange behavior, despite being witnessed many times, never became familiar. It was always embarrassing. Especially actions like running in front of the opposing player to do backflips were even more embarrassing. But regardless, the result was good. Lee Taek-hyun's goal made the score 3-2, and the Korean national team players gained a lot of mental strength. \\"Thanks to Taek-hyun's goal, it's 3-2! We can definitely win, so let's push a little harder!\\" \\"Stay focused, and we can block them! Don't be intimidated by their dribbling, and don't stick out your foot too easily! Just slowly block them without giving them angles for shooting or breaking through!\\" \\"Belgium's attack is scary, but the more they attack, the more we need to try attacking too. That's how we can win.\\" \\"Attack is the best defense, right? Agreed!\\" Hope arose that they could beat Belgium, a team that was considered much stronger in terms of overall power. That's when it happened. Shin Jae-wook also clapped loudly and shouted to his teammates. \\"Everyone is doing well! We can win, so let's play with more confidence!\\" While the Korean national team was gaining momentum. The atmosphere in Belgium was heating up. Their pride was hurt because they had conceded a goal to Korea while they were dominating the game. \\"Let's score quickly to tie the game, and then widen the score gap. Korea's attack is strong, so we need to score a lot of goals to win.\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun are too good, so it seems difficult not to concede goals, but since their defense is weak, let's attack more boldly.\\" \\"Let's get our heads together! We can't lose to Korea, right?\\" \\"We're behind 3-2 to the Korean national team. This isn't a dream, right? I feel like dying of shame, so let's score quickly.\\" The Belgian players increased their focus. The thought that they could really lose if things continued this way became a big motivation for the Belgian players. - Doesn't it seem like Belgium's coordination has become smoother? Their movements have also become sharper. - Really. It's impressive. You'd think they'd be more anxious since they're behind in the score, but looking at the Belgian players' movements, there's no sense of urgency. It seems like they've increased the tempo of the game, though. Belgium's attacking line, consisting of Romelu Lukaku, Dries Mertens, Eden Hazard, and midfielders Marouane Fellaini, Musa Dembélé, and Kevin De Bruyne, pressed the Korean national team with terrifyingly accurate passes. The Korean players actively tried to press, but it was not enough to steal the ball. It was already difficult to take the ball from Belgium's players, who were all good at breaking pressure, and now all the Belgian players maintained high concentration with clear motivation. - Dries Mertens! Incredible dribbling! He managed to break through despite facing two Korean players, Yun Seong-young and Ki Sung-yueng! - The reason he was substituted in the first half is clear now. Dries Mertens is threatening our defense. Dries Mertens, true to his reputation as an excellent dribbler, chose to break through without avoiding the two Korean players and succeeded. - We have to block him! Don't forget that Dries Mertens is also a player with a powerful shot! The Korean defense was shocked and quickly reorganized. It was a hasty reorganization, but the response wasn't bad. Especially central defender Hong Jeong-oh quickly narrowed the angle and prevented Dries Mertens from taking his signature right-footed shot. However, there was a problem. Belgium's team had many players with good shooting abilities. Tuk! Dries Mertens waited for the right moment and then passed the ball back. He believed that a teammate coming from behind could score. \\"Kevin, it's yours.\\" Kevin De Bruyne. Among the world-class players in the Belgian national team, he was the one with the best kick. He swung his leg towards the ball. The ball passed by Dries Mertens was perfect for shooting, and Kevin De Bruyne didn't miss the opportunity. Puhreung! It was a well-struck shot. The ball kicked by Kevin De Bruyne, powerful and accurate, curved sharply into the top corner of Korea's goal. Goalkeeper Jung Seok-ryong, who had made several good saves today, leaped nimbly and stretched out his arm. But he couldn't touch the ball that was curving greatly into the goal. Wow! The crowd cheered for Belgium's goal. They excitedly chanted Kevin De Bruyne's name. - Kevin De Bruyne! He scores with a tremendous shot! Belgium is really scary! The game is now tied at 3-3! - The Belgian players seem to be showing even stronger gameplay than in previous matches, right? They really want to win. - The Belgian fans are also sending tremendous cheers. Even though they've secured a spot in the round of 16, the fans' support is no joke. - Haha! This game is also a matter of pride for Belgium's fans. After tying the game at 3-3. Belgium continued to attack and threaten Korea. - Eden Hazard! He doesn't lose the ball! On both sides, Eden Hazard and Dries Mertens used their excellent dribbling skills to shake Korea's defense. - Romelu Lukaku! To stop this player, at least two people need to be assigned to him! - Hong Jeong-oh and Kim Young-won are not players who are easily pushed around, but in front of Romelu Lukaku, they're almost being bounced off. Romelu Lukaku used his unique physicality to torment Korea's center-backs. Moreover, Belgium strengthened their attack by substituting Divock Origi for the tired Romelu Lukaku. The newly introduced Divock Origi also troubled Korea's defense with his outstanding physicality. As they continued to be pushed back, Korea didn't get a chance to attack. They were too busy just defending. Perhaps that's why? Before long, even Shin Jae-wook had dropped back to join the defense. He even blocked a good shot from Belgium with a diving tackle. - Shin Jae-wook! His defensive involvement is excellent! He's making sacrifices for the team without hesitation! - Shin Jae-wook, who has already scored two goals today, is even blocking shots that could have been goals for Belgium! He's so reliable! While the commentators praised him. Shin Jae-wook's expression was stern. 'Belgium's attack is fierce. I need to break through this momentum, but it's not easy.' He kept waiting for the opponent's mistake, but the Belgian players were cunning. They maintained their line well while attacking and made no mistakes. Although it seemed like they were boldly dribbling and breaking through, whenever one player dribbled, another always supported from behind. That's when it happened. Belgium, which had been continuously hammering at Korea's goal, finally scored. It was a goal that Shin Jae-wook couldn't do anything about. - It's in...! - Ah...! The substitute Divock Origi scores a goal. Assisted by Kevin De Bruyne! - Kevin De Bruyne accurately saw Divock Origi turning back and passed it to him. It's a beautiful goal, even though they're the opposing team. It was a moment where Kevin De Bruyne's wide vision and accurate passing shone. He sent an early cross into the penalty box towards Divock Origi, who was penetrating inside, and Origi changed the direction of the ball with his head. - With Divock Origi's goal, the score is now 4-3. A lot of goals are being scored today. - It just shows how powerful both teams are. What's even more interesting is that it doesn't seem like the score will end here. Doesn't it feel like at least two more goals will be scored? - That's right. It seems like neither team wants to end it like this. Both teams are playing very aggressively whenever they get the chance, right? And if possible, I hope it's our South Korea that scores the goals. After conceding a goal to Divock Origi and falling behind 3-4. Korea raised their line and exchanged passes to create an equalizing goal. But the process wasn't easy. It was due to Belgium's strong pressure. Ki Sung-yueng, who was at the center of the midfield, was decent at breaking pressure, but not to the extent that he could maintain stability against two Belgian players. Another midfielder, Kim Kook-young, wasn't particularly good at breaking pressure. Naturally, it was difficult to overcome Belgium's pressure and send forward passes. That's when it happened. \\"Attackers, drop back to receive the ball!\\" Shin Jae-wook directed the attacking line. In the current situation, trying to receive the ball up front could lead to a counterattack, so dropping back to receive the ball was the best decision. Dropping back to receive the ball would inevitably lead to high energy consumption, but the Korean attacking line had no issues with stamina. Gu Ja-cheon had been substituted in for Son Heung-min, who had a playstyle that consumed a lot of stamina, and Ji Dong-won had come in for the tired Lee Chung-yong. Moreover, the stamina of Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun was so strong that they were known as \\"steel\\" within the Korean national team. Even though it was the second half, these two were still running around energetically. \\"Let's create one! Just a little more effort!\\" Shin Jae-wook continued to shout, boosting the team's morale, even while being closely marked by the opposing players. 'Just one chance. If I get one chance, I can make it count.' Belgium's defense was thoroughly preventing Shin Jae-wook from even touching the ball. It was natural for one player to man-mark him, and when Shin Jae-wook tried to receive a pass, 2-3 players would immediately stick to him. It was a tough situation just to get the ball. But Shin Jae-wook kept moving and trying to receive the ball. Finally, using body feinting, he managed to shake off two players for a moment and got a touch on the ball. Ki Sung-yueng passed a low and fast ball. Shin Jae-wook didn't hold onto the ball but immediately kicked it away. It was a rare opportunity to touch the ball, but he didn't get greedy. His goal was to score, so he looked for a teammate in a better position. - It's a pass from Shin Jae-wook! The ball spun by Shin Jae-wook curved into Belgium's penalty box. And one player rushed towards the ball. 'This is payback for the revenge. Taek-hyun.'"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(A) 'hu ma sam' means 'Water is life'. (B) 'sam na zo' means 'Glass of water'. (C) 'chi zo ma' means 'life of PI'. From sentence (A), we see the words 'hu', 'ma', and 'sam'. We know that 'sam' is part of sentences (A) and (B) and that the common word between the English translations of those sentences is 'water'. Therefore, 'sam' must mean 'water'. Now that we know 'sam' means 'water', we can remove it from sentence (B), which leaves us with 'na zo'. Given that 'Glass of water' is the meaning of sentence (B), and 'sam' means 'water', 'na zo' must mean 'Glass of'. Knowing the meaning of 'sam', we can also eliminate 'ma' from sentence (A) since 'Water is life' minus 'water' is 'is life'. This means 'ma' is likely associated with 'life' or 'is'. However, we can determine its exact meaning with more analysis. Looking at sentence (C), 'chi zo ma' means 'life of PI'. We know 'ma' from sentence (A), which seems to mean 'life'. Also, note that 'zo' from sentence (B) was part of 'Glass of'. This means 'zo' might represent 'of'. So now we can deduce: 'sam' = 'water' 'ma' = 'life' 'zo' = 'of' We know the entire sentence (C) is 'chi zo ma', and since 'zo ma' likely means 'of life', the remaining word 'chi' must represent 'PI'.

Let's first look at the word \\"TEACHER\\" and its coded form \\"XWPBRWM\\": T -> X E -> W A -> P C -> B H -> R E -> W R -> M Now let's look at the word \\"HIGHLY\\" and its coded form \\"RSNRDZ\\": H -> R I -> S G -> N H -> R L -> D Y -> Z If we assume a consistent shift of characters (either forward or backward in the alphabet) is being applied to each letter, we need to determine the amount of the shift. Let's take the first example \\"TEACHER\\" to \\"XWPBRWM\\": T (-7) -> X E (-7) -> W A (+15) -> P (since the alphabet has 26 letters, -11 is the same as +15) C (+9) -> B (since C + 1 = D, then wrapping around, D - 11 = B, or directly C - 10 = B) H (-7) -> R E (-7) -> W R (-7) -> M Next, \\"HIGHLY\\" to \\"RSNRDZ\\": H (-7) -> R I (-7) -> S G (+12) -> N (since the alphabet has 26 letters, -14 is the same as +12) H (-7) -> R L (+5) -> D (since L - 11 = D after wrapping) Y (-7) -> Z From the looks of it, there can be multiple patterns that could apply to different letters; however, one consistent pattern in both words is that certain letters are being shifted by 7 positions backward in the alphabet. Using this simple rule, let's try coding \\"CHARITY\\": C (-7) -> V (Cycle back 7 positions from C: B, A, Z, Y, X, W, V) H (-7) -> A (Cycle back 7 positions from H: G, F, E, D, C, B, A) A (+15) -> P (Alternatively, A - 11 = P) R (-7) -> K (Cycle back 7 positions from R: Q, P, O, N, M, L, K) I (-7) -> B (Cycle back 7 positions from I: H, G, F, E, D, C, B) T (-7) -> M (Cycle back 7 positions from T: S, R, Q, P, O, N, M) Y (-7) -> R (Cycle back 7 positions from Y: X, W, V, U, T, S, R) So based on the pattern of shifting 7 positions backward, \\"CHARITY\\" would be coded as \\"VPKBMRR\\". However, given that there are inconsistencies and that the code does not consistently use the 7 positions shift for each letter, this pattern might not be entirely correct.

The second candidate gets 42 marks more than the pass percentage: ( 0.32x = ) Pass marks ( + 42 ). We already have the expression for Pass marks from the first candidate's information, so we can substitute it into the second candidate's equation: ( 0.32x = (0.20x + 30) + 42 ). Simplifying, we get: ( 0.32x = 0.20x + 72 ), ( 0.32x - 0.20x = 72 ), ( 0.12x = 72 ). Now, we solve for ( x ): ( x = 72 / 0.12 ), ( x = 600 ).

Find the percentage profit earned by the shopkeeper.","completion":"First, let's calculate the profit margin based on the marked-up price and the discount offered, ignoring the cheating aspect. If the dealer marks up the goods by 20%, then the marked price (MP) becomes: MP = Cost Price (CP) * 1.20 If he then gives a discount of 10%, the selling price (SP) becomes: SP = MP * (1 - Discount %) SP = MP * 0.90 Substituting the marked price into the selling price equation: SP = 1.20 * CP * 0.90 Combining the factors gives us: SP = CP * 1.08 Now, considering the cheating part, when the dealer buys 1 kilogram (1000 grams), he only pays for 900 grams. Similarly, when selling 1 kilogram, the buyer only receives 900 grams. This means effectively, in both buying and selling, the dealer is giving and receiving 0.9 kilograms for the price of 1 kilogram. So, if he's supposed to sell 1 kilogram, he actually sells 0.9 kilogram for the price of 1 kilogram, which mathematically looks like he's selling the goods at: Effective SP (ESP) = SP / 0.9 Substituting the previous SP calculation: ESP = (CP * 1.08) / 0.9 Simplifying gives us: ESP = CP * 1.20 Thus, the effective selling price is 20% over the original cost price, which means a 20% profit margin. But we can't forget that the dealer also pays for 900 grams while buying 1 kilogram, which effectively reduces his cost price by 10% (since 900 grams is 90% of a kilogram). So, the effective cost price (ECP) while purchasing is: ECP = CP * 0.9 The actual profit percentage is then calculated by comparing what the buyer paid (ESP) to what the dealer effectively paid for it (ECP): Profit % = [(ESP - ECP) / ECP] * 100 Substituting ESP and ECP into the profit percentage formula: Profit % = [((CP * 1.20) - (CP * 0.9)) / (CP * 0.9)] * 100 Profit % = [(CP * 0.30) / (CP * 0.9)] * 100 Canceling out CP and simplifying further, we get: Profit % = (0.30 / 0.9) * 100 Profit % = 1/3 * 100 Profit % = 33.33% The profit percentage earned by the shopkeeper is 33.33%."},{"prompt":"The difference between C.I. and S.I. accrued on an amount of Rs. 20,000 in 2 years was Rs. 392.

The formula directly gives the difference between the compound interest (compounded annually) and simple interest for two years on the same principal and at the same rate of interest. Given: Principal amount (P) = Rs. 20,000 Difference between C.I. and S.I. = Rs. 392 Time (T) = 2 years (which we don't need to use because the formula is specifically for 2 years) Let's now isolate the rate (R) from the formula: 392 = 20,000 * (R/100)² 392 = 200 * (R/100)² We can simplify the equation further by dividing both sides by 200: 392 / 200 = (R/100)² 1.96 = (R/100)² Now we take the square root of both sides to solve for R: √1.96 = R / 100 1.4 = R / 100 Finally, we multiply both sides by 100 to find the rate of interest: R = 1.4 * 100 R = 14% The rate of interest per annum is 14%."},{"prompt":"A room is 4 mts 50 cm long and 1 mts 75 cm broad. The floor needs to be paved with a minimum number of square slabs. Find the least number of slabs required for this purpose.","completion":"To pave the floor with the minimum number of square slabs and ensure that the slabs fit exactly without needing to be cut, the size of the slab should be the largest square that can cover both the length and the breadth of the room without any remainder. This size corresponds to the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the length and the breadth of the room. First, we will convert the measurements to centimeters: Length = 4 meters 50 cm = 450 cm Breadth = 1 meter 75 cm = 175 cm Now, we find the GCD of 450 cm and 175 cm. The GCD of 450 and 175 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm: Step 1: 450 ÷ 175 = 2 remainder 100 Step 2: 175 ÷ 100 = 1 remainder 75 Step 3: 100 ÷ 75 = 1 remainder 25 Step 4: 75 ÷ 25 = 3 remainder 0 Once we reach a remainder of 0, the divisor (25 cm in this case) is the GCD. So, the largest square slab that can be used has a side of 25 cm. Now, we will calculate how many slabs are needed to cover the length and breadth of the room: Number of slabs along the length = 450 cm / 25 cm = 18 Number of slabs along the breadth = 175 cm / 25 cm = 7 The total number of slabs required to pave the floor is: Total number of slabs = Number of slabs along the length × Number of slabs along the breadth Total number of slabs = 18 × 7 = 126 A minimum of 126 square slabs, each with a side of 25 cm, is required to pave the floor."},{"prompt":"Pointing to a man, a woman said, \\"His mother is the only daughter of my mother.\\" How is the woman related to the man?","completion":"The woman said, \\"His mother is the only daughter of my mother.\\" This means that the man's mother is the woman's mother's only daughter.

The formula to convert degrees to radians is straightforward: radians = degrees * (PI / 180) Where \`PI\` is the mathematical constant π (approximately equal to 3.14159). Godot already includes a function to do this, which is \`deg_to_rad()\`. You don't need to worry about the conversion math yourself; just use the function wherever you need it. Here is an example of how to use \`deg_to_rad()\` in GDScript (Godot's scripting language): \`\`\`gdscript extends Node func _ready(): var angle_in_degrees = 90 var angle_in_radians = deg_to_rad(angle_in_degrees) print(\\"Angle in degrees: \\", angle_in_degrees) print(\\"Angle in radians: \\", angle_in_radians) \`\`\` If you run this script, it would output: \`\`\` Angle in degrees: 90 Angle in radians: 1.570796 \`\`\` This demonstrates that an angle of 90 degrees is equivalent to approximately 1.57 radians (π/2). Keep in mind that Godot 4.2.1 is a specific version of Godot, and while the \`deg_to_rad\` function is quite fundamental and unlikely to change, always ensure you consult the specific documentation for your version of Godot if you encounter any issues."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It handles both mono and stereo audio by averaging the channels if needed. 2. \`find_loudest_moments(audio_filename, num_moments, segment_duration, video_duration, starting_offset, ending_offset)\`: Identifies the loudest moments in an audio file by reading the WAV file and finding the highest volume points, taking into account the specified offsets and avoiding overlapping moments. 3. \`ask_peak_position()\`: Asks the user to specify how the peak loudness should be positioned within the extracted video segments and validates the user's input. 4. \`extract_segments(video_path, moments, segment_duration, peak_position_choice)\`: Extracts and re-encodes video segments around the identified loud moments. The start time of each segment is adjusted based on the peak position preference. 5. \`process_video_files(starting_offset_seconds, ending_offset_seconds, num_moments, segment_duration, peak_position_choice)\`: Processes all video files in the current directory, extracting audio tracks as temporary WAV files, finding the loudest moments, extracting video segments, and finally cleaning up the temporary audio files. 6.

The version of the \`find_loudest_moments\` function I provided earlier doesn't account for overlapping segments, which means it segmentizes the audio linearly without overlaps. If you wish to allow for overlapping segments and still find the loudest moments, you can use \`np.convolve\` with a sliding window technique for the loudness array. This way, you will account for overlaps and can search for peaks within this continuous loudness profile. Here is a revised version of the \`find_loudest_moments\` function that corrects this issue and allows for potential overlapping segments: \`\`\`python def find_loudest_moments(audio_filename, num_moments, segment_duration, video_duration, starting_offset, ending_offset, rate): _, audio_data = wavfile.read(audio_filename) if audio_data.ndim == 2: # Convert stereo to mono if needed audio_data = np.mean(audio_data, axis=1) loudness = calculate_loudness(audio_data).astype(float) num_samples_per_segment = int(rate * segment_duration) # Create a window for convolution that will sum up the loudness within each segment window window = np.ones(num_samples_per_segment) # Convolve window with loudness to get the loudness sum for each possible overlapping segment convolved_loudness = np.convolve(loudness, window, mode='valid') # Find segment indices corresponding to the loudest segments loudest_indices = np.argpartition(convolved_loudness, -num_moments)[-num_moments:] # Convert from indices to times in seconds loudest_times = loudest_indices / rate # Adjust times to incorporate starting_offset and ending_offset valid_times = [time for time in loudest_times if (time >= starting_offset) and ((time + segment_duration) <= (video_duration - ending_offset))] # If we want the highest peaks, sort by actual loudness value sorted_valid_times = sorted(valid_times, key=lambda t: convolved_loudness[int(t * rate)], reverse=True) # Return only the number of requested moments return sorted_valid_times[:num_moments] \`\`\` This new version of the function takes the sliding window approach by summing the loudness in each possible segment using convolution, which simulates overlapping windowed segments. The loudest segments are determined by the convolution results, and then time adjustments are made to account for starting and ending offsets. Be sure to replace the \`find_loudest_moments\` function in your script with the above code.

Here is the correct implementation of that function and its integration into the script: \`\`\`python import os import subprocess import numpy as np import uuid from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip from scipy.io import wavfile import random video_extensions = ['.mp4', '.mkv', '.wmv', '.avi'] output_folder = 'Output' def calculate_loudness(audio_data): # Calculate RMS loudness for each frame rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio_data**2, axis=0)) return rms if audio_data.ndim == 1 else np.sqrt(np.mean(rms, axis=0)) def find_loudest_moments(audio_filename, num_moments, segment_duration, video_duration, starting_offset, ending_offset, rate, allow_overlap): _, audio_data = wavfile.read(audio_filename) if audio_data.ndim == 2: # Convert stereo to mono if needed audio_data = np.mean(audio_data, axis=1) loudness = calculate_loudness(audio_data) num_samples_per_segment = int(rate * segment_duration) # Calculate loudness for each segment if allow_overlap: # If allowing overlap, calculate loudness more finely grained loudness_per_sample = np.array([np.mean(loudness[max(0, i - num_samples_per_segment // 2):i + num_samples_per_segment // 2]) for i in range(len(loudness))]) sorted_indices = np.argsort(-loudness_per_sample) # Sort indices by loudness loudest_indices = sorted_indices[:num_moments] # Pick the first num_moments indices else: # If not allowing overlap, calculate loudness per segment loudness = loudness[:len(loudness) - (len(loudness) % num_samples_per_segment)] loudness_per_segment = loudness.reshape(-1, num_samples_per_segment).mean(axis=1) loudest_indices = loudness_per_segment.argsort()[-num_moments:] # Convert index to time loudest_times = [i * segment_duration for i in loudest_indices] # Adjust times to ensure they fall within the starting and ending offsets valid_times = [time for time in loudest_times if starting_offset <= time <= video_duration - ending_offset - segment_duration] return np.sort(valid_times[:num_moments]) # ...

Please ensure you replace your \`calculate_loudness\` function with the one provided above, which correctly computes loudness for each frame. Moreover, the \`find_loudest_moments\` function has been modified to either consider overlapping (for more fine-grained analysis) or non-overlapping segments, based on user input.

The videos produced by Langgesagt often provide critical analysis and in-depth explanations of these darker aspects of the world. They highlight potential problems with renewable energy, the risks associated with artificial intelligence, or the impacts of overpopulation on the planet. The content aims to educate viewers about the potential negative outcomes of various global phenomena, raising awareness and stimulating critical thinking about these issues. Despite its focus on pessimistic themes, Langgesagt aims to inspire meaningful discussions and encourages viewers to question the status quo. The channel seeks to strike a balance between shining a light on the negative aspects of various global issues while also keeping a nuanced perspective, acknowledging that positive change is still possible. Langgesagt's dark red burning Earth under the upside-down ocean sunset avatar serves as a visual reminder of the urgency in addressing the world's challenges. It signifies the dire consequences of inaction, creating an emotionally evocative image that resonates with viewers and compels them to engage with the content.

When Tommy hears about the trial runs of a new high-speed train, his excitement knows no bounds. The new train is set to be the fastest in Britain, and seeing it whiz by becomes Tommy’s new dream. He learns that the test runs will take place on a nearby but scarcely used part of the rail line, and Tommy becomes determined to witness this momentous event. The plot thickens when Tommy overhears a conversation implying that a small group of local businessmen is plotting to sabotage the test run in an effort to prevent the new high-speed service from diverting business from their trucking companies. With the support of his friends, Jill and Charlie, and Buster by his side, Tommy sets out on a daring adventure to save the high-speed train from disaster. Tommy's journey isn't easy, fraught with challenges as the children try to outsmart the businessmen and alert the authorities.

With that in mind, let's revise the details a bit. Title: \\"High Speed Trainspotter\\" Year: 1973 Duration: 60 minutes Produced by: Children’s Film Foundation Plot Summary: \\"High Speed Trainspotter\\" tells the heartwarming story of Tommy, a passionate young railway enthusiast with a special love for the newest advancements in train technology. Living his quiet life in a rural English village, 14-year-old Tommy and his dog Buster frequently visit the local train station to indulge in his hobby of trainspotting – noting down all the different locomotives and carriages that pass by. The film is set during a time of innovation in the British railway industry, with the experimental APT-E conducting its trial runs. The APT-E, with its distinctive sleek design and promise of higher speeds than ever before, captivates Tommy's imagination. When he learns of a test run that is going to happen close to his hometown, Tommy is ecstatic at the chance to see the cutting-edge train in person. An unexpected twist arises as Tommy accidentally overhears a plot by a group of unscrupulous businessmen who are threatened by the new train's potential to change the travel industry. They plan to sabotage the APT-E trial run in hopes of maintaining their hold on the freight industry. Together with his friends, Jill and Charlie, Tommy embarks on an adventure filled with determination and urgency to thwart the sabotage and ensure the revolutionary APT-E can prove its capabilities without hindrance. The trio's cleverness and quick thinking lead them on a daring mission, evading the skeptical adults and using every trick at their disposal to expose the plan to the public and the railway authorities. As Tommy and his friends work against the clock, the film features scenes of camaraderie and tension, set to the backdrop of the English countryside and the 1970s railway community. They encounter various personalities from the world of trains, reinforcing their resolve and highlighting the transformative power of rail transport technology. In the climactic sequence, the kids ingeniously manage to intercept the saboteurs, leading to a heart-pounding chase sequence that makes full use of the train yard and the APT-E prototype itself. Through their bravery and resourcefulness, they save the day, allowing the APT-E to speed along the tracks triumphantly. \\"High Speed Trainspotter\\" ends with Tommy receiving recognition from the railway officials and being offered the chance to ride on the prototype he saved, granting him a glimpse into the future of train travel.

David's adventure begins on an ordinary evening at London's King's Cross station. In his usual rush to catch what he thinks is his regular suburban train, he mistakenly boards the non-stop \\"Flying Scotsman\\" express service to Edinburgh. Too late, he realizes his error as the train speeds off into the night, taking him hundreds of miles away from home. Aboard the express, David meets an eclectic mix of passengers, each with their unique stories. Among them is Mr. MacTavish, a former railway executive who shares David's predicament - he too had once boarded the wrong train as a young boy during the golden age of steam. Mr. MacTavish's tales of his own railway adventures light up David's imagination and offer comfort amidst his anxiety about being so far from home. Then there's Angus, the dour Scot with a deadpan wit, whose passion for Scotland's history and landscapes slowly turns his initial annoyance at David's intrusion into a fondness for the young train enthusiast. His gruff exterior hides a soft spot for the railway and the Scottish Highlands. Also sharing their journey is Dr. Fiona Campbell, a female academic researching innovative education techniques. She finds David's accidental misadventure an inspiring example of experiential learning and engages him in conversations that cross the boundary between formal education and real-world experiences. As the train thunders through the night, David becomes less apprehensive and more enthralled by the spontaneous journey, watching the countryside pass by and learning about the lives of his fellow travelers. With each hour, the train brings new surprises and lessons about the wide world beyond his train-spotting notebook. Upon arrival in Edinburgh, David is welcomed by the kindness of strangers. The railway staff, hearing of his unintended trip, band together to ensure a safe return to London for the young traveler. But before heading back, David is treated to a brief but eye-opening tour, graciously provided by Angus, revealing the grandeur of Edinburgh's railway heritage and the city's majestic sights. \\"Highland Fling\\" reaches its end as David boards the train home, his notebook richer with new entries and his heart filled with stories to tell. He's not just a train-spotter anymore, but a young adventurer who has experienced the pulse of Scotland and the warmth of its people, all thanks to one serendipitous train ride. The film, true to Children’s Film Foundation form, is a light-hearted and family-friendly exploration of independence, the value of community, and the unexpected journeys that shape our lives. It captures a snapshot of a time in Britain when travel could still bring about accidental discoveries and bonds formed through shared stories, all set against the backdrop of Britain's historical relationship with trains and railways."},{"prompt":"Given the production date, who might have been cast in the roles suggested above as supporting actors?","completion":"In the mid-1970s, the Children's Film Foundation (CFF) often featured both up-and-coming young actors and well-known British character actors in adult supporting roles. While casting such a film in 1975, the producers would likely have turned to reliable and recognizable faces from British television and film. Here are some actors who might have been considered for the roles suggested in \\"Highland Fling\\": For Mr. MacTavish, the former railway executive: - Bernard Cribbins: Known for his roles in \\"The Railway Children\\" (1970) and a variety of television series, Cribbins could have brought warmth and humor to the part of Mr. MacTavish. - Wilfrid Brambell: At the time famous for playing Albert Steptoe in the BBC's \\"Steptoe and Son,\\" Brambell could have played an elderly and nostalgic railway man. - Geoffrey Bayldon: Although best known for playing the title role in the TV series \\"Catweazle,\\" Bayldon often played eccentric or authoritative figures and would be a fit for the role. For Angus, the dour Scot: - Gordon Jackson: By 1975, Jackson was well-known for his role in \\"The Great Escape\\" (1963) and as Hudson in \\"Upstairs, Downstairs.\\" He would have added authenticity and depth to the role of the passionate Scot. - John Laurie: Familiar to audiences for his portrayal of Private Frazer in \\"Dad's Army,\\" Laurie's Scottish background and skill in playing stern characters would make him an excellent choice. - Duncan Macrae: A distinguished Scottish actor who appeared in films such as \\"Tunes of Glory\\" (1960), Macrae could have played this role with a genuine Scottish flair. For Dr. Fiona Campbell, the female academic: - Celia Johnson: Best known for her role in \\"Brief Encounter\\" (1945), Johnson continued to work through the '60s and '70s and would have brought a dignified presence to the film. - Joan Greenwood: Recognizable for her distinctive voice and stage presence, Greenwood could have played the academic with a sophisticated and engaging air. - Penelope Keith: Having become famous for her role in \\"The Good Life\\" and known for her strong-willed characters, Keith would have been a good fit for an academic character. Child actors for leading roles like David were usually scouted from drama schools or through auditions that sought out fresh and natural talent. The film might have cast a lesser-known child actor who had the necessary charm and could carry the film with a sense of wonder and curiosity. Please note that these suggestions are speculative, based on the types of actors the CFF might have cast rather than any specific casting records from the time."},{"prompt":"I'd have had Jackson as the railway executive , (He'd played strong authority figures previously), Laurie as Angus would fit with an initally hard character, but one who could lighten up. I'd have had someone like Felicity Kendal or Jenny Aguttter (possibly given her age at the time a student here ) as academic.","completion":"Your casting choices are indeed more fitting considering the actors' profiles and the time frame. Let me update the casting with your suggestions: For Mr. MacTavish, the former railway executive: - Gordon Jackson: Having portrayed strong authority figures and possessing a distinguished air, Jackson could adeptly take on the role of a railway executive who has a wealth of experience and is sympathetic to the protagonist's accidental adventure. For Angus, the dour Scot: - John Laurie: With his ability to portray characters with a tougher exterior that eventually softens, Laurie would be ideal for the character of Angus, bringing depth and likeability to the initially hardened Scottish man. For Dr. Fiona Campbell, the female academic: - Felicity Kendal: Known for her role in \\"The Good Life,\\" Kendal embodied the charm and intellect that could suit a young, enthusiastic academic. Her screen presence would provide a vibrant and supportive character for young David to interact with. - Jenny Agutter: Having already starred in \\"The Railway Children\\" (1970), Agutter could convincingly play an older student or a youthful academic with a kind and intelligent demeanor, offering guidance and understanding to David's unforeseen journey. Using these actors, the film \\"Highland Fling\\" would not only benefit from authentic portrayals but also bring a touch of star quality that might draw in family audiences familiar with their work from other popular British films and television series of the time. With a central cast of skilled performers, the story's warmth, humor, and adventure would shine through, providing a memorable and engaging film experience."},{"prompt":"The inital scenes at the London Termini , might have been filimed somewhere unusal like Marylebone , (even though trains for Scotland leave from Kings Cross). Euston wouldn't have worked as by 1975 it wouldn't have been possible to get to the platforms as easily..","completion":"Indeed, using Marylebone station as a stand-in location for filming is typical of the sort of logistical changes film productions make. In fact, Marylebone's architecture and less hectic environment compared to the major termini like King's Cross and Euston could make it an ideal filming location for several reasons: 1. Aesthetics: Marylebone station has an older look and feel, with early 20th-century architecture, which can stand in for King's Cross given the proper camera angles and set dressing. It’s well-preserved and would give an authentic period feel to the film. 2. Reduced Traffic: Being one of the smaller London termini, Marylebone would typically have had fewer passengers and train movements, making it easier for a film crew to manage the space and film without disturbing operational needs. 3. Accessibility: Filming in a busy station like King's Cross or Euston in the 1970s, especially after modernization, would have been more challenging due to the volume of passengers, tighter security, and more restrictive filming permissions. Marylebone's more relaxed environment would allow for greater control of shooting scenes without many background disruptions. 4. Plausibility: While trains to Scotland normally depart from King's Cross or Euston, for the purpose of a children's adventure film, a little creative license is perfectly acceptable, especially if the station is not explicitly named in the film. In \\"Highland Fling,\\" the opening scenes shot at Marylebone can be carefully planned to avoid showing details that would make the location recognizable to those familiar with London's railway stations. With good set design, right angles, and some creative editing, audiences would accept the setting as part of the film's narrative without concern for pinpoint geographic accuracy. The focus would be on David's mix-up that lands him on the wrong train, setting the scene for his unexpected journey to Scotland."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Childrens Film Foundation film (Made in 1975) - \\"Western Intrigue\\" - A sequel to Highland Fling, David still train-spotting but more careful, ends up on an intended Plymouth express , and encounters Mr. MacTavish ( Now working for Western Region). David however has overheard some shady characters whilst in the Buffet Car, planning a \\"document theft\\" against a prominent politcian travelling in first class. David utilises his train-spotter notebook and McTavish's railway insider knowledge to create a fake manifest of train movements, which with the help of the politician they substitute, so that when the document theft happens, the crooks have 'duff gen' (as David puts it). The train is dramatically met at Plymouth as the uniformed officers hint that they've been trying to nab the crooks for months..","completion":"Title: \\"Western Intrigue\\" Year: 1975 Duration: 60 minutes Produced by: Children’s Film Foundation Plot Summary: \\"Western Intrigue\\" opens with the familiar sight of our diligent young train-spotter, David, who, after his unexpected journey to Scotland in \\"Highland Fling,\\" has become even more devoted to his hobby—this time with an added level of caution to avoid past mistakes. Excited for his deliberate trip to Plymouth aboard a Western Region express, his adventure begins anew when fate seats him in the buffet car within earshot of some shady characters. Amidst his jotting down of train numbers and diligent study of the railway's comings and goings, David's ears prick up as he overhears the hushed but urgent tones of a plot unfolding. The villains are discussing their cunning plan to steal sensitive documents from a prominent politician traveling incognito on the same train. Unsure of what to do, David soon crosses paths with Mr. MacTavish, who has since transferred to work for the Western Region. Recognizing the retired executive, David confides in him, and together, they hatch a clever counter-plot using David’s notebook and Mr. MacTavish’s extensive knowledge of train operations. Under their quickly devised plan and with Mr. MacTavish’s connections within the railway services, they concoct a fake train manifest, listing altered train movements and stops. Meanwhile, David has the tricky task of befriend the targeted politician under the guise of an autograph request for his notebook to convincingly offer the bogus information. With the stage set, the ruse works a little too well. The crooks follow the \\"duff gen,\\" as David aptly puts it, and find themselves on a wild goose chase chasing down a train that isn't carrying their intended mark. In the meantime, the unsuspecting politician is secretly escorted away from Plymouth to a secure location, safeguarding the documents. As the express rolls into Plymouth station, a team of uniformed officers, tipped off by Mr. MacTavish, is waiting on the platform for the thieves. As the criminals are apprehended in a dramatic showdown, the officers reveal that these particular crooks have been artfully dodging the law for several months, and thanks to David and Mr. MacTavish, their spree has finally come to a halt. \\"Western Intrigue\\" concludes with commendation for David’s quick thinking and his invaluable notebook full of timetables and train numbers—proof that even hobbies can lead to heroic deeds. David’s passion for trainspotting is the unexpected hero of the day, and Mr. MacTavish's expertise and camaraderie reinforce the importance of cross-generational friendship and collaboration. The film delivers a mix of suspense, strategy, and serendipity, all wrapped up in the world of rail travel, echoing the adventure and values that characterized the Children’s Film Foundation productions—inspiring wonder, wit, and a bit of bravery in their young audience."},{"prompt":"Although a CFF production, some of the cinematogrpahy borrows from various \\"thriller\\" approaches. What might a stand out example of this be, maybe how David ovehearing the crooks is filmed?","completion":"For a Children’s Film Foundation production like \\"Western Intrigue,\\" though primarily targeted at a younger audience, employing elements of suspense and thriller cinematography can make for exciting storytelling. The use of these techniques would be carefully balanced to retain the family-friendly atmosphere while adding dramatic tension to the plot. Here's how a standout scene, such as David overhearing the crooks, might be cinematically approached: **Close-ups and Point-of-View Shots:** The scene begins with a series of close-ups on David’s face, his eyes wide with curiosity and his ears straining to catch snippets of conversation from the neighboring table. The camera then switches to point-of-view shots from David’s perspective, as he tries to discreetly glance over his shoulder or through the reflective surface of a window to see the crooks without attracting attention. **Over-the-Shoulder Framing:** To create a sense of eavesdropping and voyeurism, the camera would use an over-the-shoulder framing of the crooks. This classic technique allows the audience to peer over David’s shoulder, or even one of the crooks', to observe the tension-filled exchange of words while maintaining an intimate connection with the protagonist’s experience. **Selective Focus and Depth of Field:** Selective focus might be employed to isolate David from the bustling buffet car environment. His face, taken in sharp focus, contrasts with the blurred background, emphasizing his feeling of isolation amidst the crowd while honing in on the seriousness of the information he overhears. The focus may shift from David to the crooks, keeping one group in focus while blurring the other, underscore the clandestine nature of their activities. **Sound Design:** The use of diegetic sounds, such as the low rumbling of the train, clinking of cutlery, and chattering passengers, would be softened or faded out, highlighting the crooks' dialogue as David eavesdrops. This selective sound design, combined with a tense or suspenseful musical underscoring, can accentuate the illicit nature of their plans and David's growing sense of danger. **Cross-Cutting and Inter-cutting:** To build up the suspense, the film could use cross-cutting techniques to show the actions of the crooks (planning the theft, inspecting their tools, exchanging covert glances) intercut with shots of David piecing together their plot. This back-and-forth editing not only heightens the tension but also quickens the pace of the scene, keeping audiences engaged. While these cinematic techniques are common in adult thrillers, their implementation in a CFF production like \\"Western Intrigue\\" would be crafted with the younger audience in mind. The scenes, though suspenseful, would not be overly intense or frightening. Instead, they'd be infused with a sense of adventurous intrigue appropriate for a children's spy caper, ensuring that the suspense serves to thrill and entertain rather than unsettle."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Childrens Film Foundation film (Made in 1958) - Black And White ..

Jane, a young botany enthusiast with a vast curiosity about plant life, spends much of her free time assisting her father, a respected scientist working at a local research station. One clear night, after observing the streak of a shooting star blazing across the sky, Jane discovers a cluster of peculiar seeds nestled in the earth where the meteor seemed to have passed overhead. Intrigued by their origin and the chance discovery, Jane presents the seeds to her father, who encourages her to plant them within the secure confines of their greenhouse to observe and document their growth. Under Jane and her father's attentive care, the seedling sprouts and develops rapidly, soon growing into a sizable and extraordinary cactus. To their amazement, on nights when the moon is full, the cactus begins to produce otherworldly music—haunting melodies that seem to resonate with the lunar light. The discovery captures the attention of the scientific community and neighbors alike. However, Jane and her father are determined to decipher the meaning behind the cacti's lunar serenades and understand what this extraterrestrial visitor requires to complete its life cycle. As the story progresses, the benevolent intentions of the cacti become clear. Through a series of experiments and careful communication attempts, Jane and her father learn that the cacti require specific nutrients and conditions found on Earth—elements that are scarce or absent in space. As they work together to fulfill the cacti's requirements, they form a deep bond with the living organism, growing fond of its presence and ethereal singing. The climax of the film occurs as the completion of the cacti's life cycle coincides with a rare celestial event. The community gathers under a sky lit by a meteor shower, where they witness the cacti transform, releasing spores or seeds of light that ascend towards the heavens in a breathtaking display. Jane and her father, along with the spellbound onlookers, realize that the cacti's life cycle has come full circle, and its progeny are returning to the cosmos from whence they came. \\"The Singing Cacti\\" ends with a sense of wonder and accomplishment. Jane's passion for botany is fulfilled beyond her wildest dreams, and her father has contributed to a discovery of cosmic significance. The film emphasizes themes of environmental harmony, the interconnectedness of all living things, and the boundless possibilities of the universe. In a stylistic nod to the science fiction genre of the time, the visuals would include emphasizing the moonlit silhouette of the cacti against the contrast of the dark sky and the light-starved environment of the greenhouse. The special effects for the cacti's singing could be produced using theremin music, a staple of 1950s sci-fi, to underscore the otherworldly aspects of the film. And with an emphasis on practical effects, the cacti itself would likely be a combination of puppetry and carefully designed props, illuminated in a way that befits the era's technical capabilities and the CFF's educational yet entertaining storytelling approach."},{"prompt":"Casting wise, \\"Father\\" may well have been actor known for TV work, but not necessarily someone that was involved with Quatermass.","completion":"For a 1958 Children's Film Foundation production like \\"The Singing Cacti,\\" the team would be inclined to cast an actor recognizable to audiences and who could believably portray a dedicated and supportive father figure with a scientific background. You're right that likely they'd avoid actors directly associated with the high-profile Quatermass series to maintain a separate identity for the film. Here are a couple of potential actors who could have been considered for the role of Jane's father: 1. **André Morell**: Though he did appear in \\"Quatermass and the Pit\\" (1958-1959), Morell’s work was so significant and varied in British film and television that he very well might have been a strong contender for the role in our hypothetical production, which would have been filmed possibly before his involvement in the Quatermass series. 2. **Richard Vernon**: With his gentlemanly aura and gravitas, Vernon was often seen in authority roles. His classical acting background could lend a credible air of scientific intellect and paternal warmth to the father character. 3. **John Laurie**: While better known for his work in the '70s on \\"Dad's Army,\\" Laurie had a lengthy career prior and could have brought a Scottish distinctiveness to the role if the father were characterized as somewhat more eccentric or idiosyncratic. 4. **Cecil Parker**: With his distinctive voice and a career that included roles as upright English gentlemen, Parker could offer a portrayal that balanced fatherly concern with scientific curiosity. 5. **Nigel Patrick**: Known for his charming screen presence and a wide range of roles in British cinema, Patrick could have handled the father’s role adeptly, bringing a mixture of intellect and compassion. The protagonist Jane would perhaps have been portrayed by a fresh face, as the CFF was known for casting new young talent. The production would likely hold auditions to find an actress who could bring a sense of adventure and wonder to the character. The cast would ideally reflect a family-friendly appeal, with actors capable of conveying a sense of intrigue and enthusiasm for the scientific elements of the story, which are at the heart of \\"The Singing Cacti.\\""},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Childrens Film Foundation film - \\"Broom Handle in a Box\\" - (1958) (B/W) - An improvished school music group creates a 'new' sound from the contents of a broom closet.

In the midst of the skiffle craze sweeping the nation, the school's music resources are limited, inspiring a resourceful group of pupils to turn a broom closet's contents into musical instruments. The film opens with the school's music teacher lamenting the lack of proper instruments but encouraging creativity among the students. Taking this to heart, our plucky protagonist, Charlie, stumbles upon a broom handle, a washboard, and a tea chest in the cleaning closet. With a few strings, some ingenuity, and an infectious sense of rhythm, Charlie and his friends—Maggie on the washboard, Tom with a thimble for picking strings, and Ellie playing a makeshift drum—form a skiffle band using the unexpected finds. As the group practices, they create a unique sound that catches the attention of the entire school, including Martin, a calculating sixth-former who sees potential not in the music, but in the possibility of financial gain. Martin offers to 'manage' the band, convincing them that he can book them gigs at school events and local fairs. Under the watchful eye of their kindly music teacher, who suspects Martin's intentions might not be entirely altruistic, the band begins to gain popularity. They play at school assemblies, local charity events, and community gatherings, earning small amounts of money that Martin assures them are being saved for new instruments. However, as the band's fame grows, it soon becomes clear that Martin is not being truthful about the earnings. A pivotal scene has Charlie and the gang discovering that Martin has been pocketing the money for himself. With some detective work and a fortuitous mix-up involving the band's money box, the truth is revealed. In a dramatic classroom showdown, Martin is exposed, and the money is returned to its rightful owners—the band. Learning valuable lessons about trust and the value of their talents, the students decide to continue performing, not for the money, but for the love of music and the joy it brings to their community. \\"Broom Handle in a Box\\" culminates with a grand school concert where the band performs to an enthusiastic audience, their music teacher proudly watching. The film ends with the surprise donation of new musical instruments by a local benefactor impressed by their perseverance and talent. The film, reflecting CFF's ethos of moral and educational storytelling, emphasizes the themes of honesty, teamwork, innovation, and believing in one's abilities.

Here are some of the techniques and tropes that this CFF production might have incorporated: **Dramatic Cliffhangers**: Each episode of the serial would end with a tense cliffhanger, designed to ensure that audiences would return to see the next installment. These could range from physical dangers like the characters being left in perilous situations to intellectual puzzles that they are on the verge of solving. **Resourceful Heroes**: Dick Barton and Snowy would be depicted as resourceful and quick-thinking, always managing to find a way out of the tight spots they are left in at the end of each episode, much like the protagonists in classic serials such as \\"Flash Gordon\\" and \\"The Perils of Pauline.\\" **Exotic Locations and Settings**: Although the story is set in a beachside town, the serial could make use of interesting local features—caves, cliffs, a funfair, or a historic fort—to provide visually exciting settings that echo the exotic locales often seen in adventure serials. **Stock Characters**: The use of familiar character types, such as the plucky youngster (Terry), the wise and experienced mentor (Dick Barton), and the comedic relief (Snowy), would resonate with the audience's expectations from the genre. **Narrative Hooks**: These serials would typically open with a recap of previous events and a dramatic narration that would hook the viewers' attention and set the stage for the current episode's action. **Action and Pursuits**: Chase scenes on foot, by vehicle, or through other thrilling means of transportation were a staple of adventure serials and would be a natural fit for this kind of production. **Stylized Acting and Dialogue**: Pulling from the melodramatic style of early serials, characters may deliver lines in a heightened manner, emphasizing the urgency of their situation or the importance of their mission. **Morality and Justice**: Echoing the clear-cut morality common in classic serials, Dick Barton's efforts would ultimately lead to the rightful outcome, with the good guys winning and the \\"villains\\" getting their just deserts. **Inventive Problem-Solving**: As in many adventure serials, the heroes would use cleverness and unconventional methods (like using items found in a broom closet) to resolve problems and overcome challenges. **Musical Cues**: The score, including the use of the \\"Devil's Galop,\\" would tie into the action and create emotional responses akin to the dramatic and suspenseful music of cinema serials. By employing these well-worn conventions, \\"Dick Barton and the Youthful Hope\\" would offer a nostalgic nod to the serials that many parents of that era would have grown up with, while simultaneously providing engaging, age-appropriate entertainment to the children of the 1950s."},{"prompt":"给个背景图片网站，免费的","completion":"以下是一些提供免费背景图片的网站： 1.

В этом эссе я рассмотрю проблему группового грабежа, его последствия и возможные пути противодействия этому явлению. Групповой грабеж – это организованное действие нескольких лиц, работающих вместе с целью лишить своих жертв имущества или денег. Чаще всего такое преступление совершается с использованием насилия или угрозы насилием. Основными факторами, способствующими возникновению групповых грабежей, являются бедность, социальные неравенства и слабость правоохранительной системы. Последствия групповых грабежей для общества и индивидуумов чрезвычайно серьезны. Во-первых, такие преступления создают атмосферу страха и неуверенности среди граждан. Люди снижают свою активность и ограничивают свободу передвижения, опасаясь стать следующей жертвой. Это снижает качество жизни в обществе и затрудняет его развитие. Групповые грабежи также наносят непоправимый ущерб самим жертвам. Они лишаются своего имущества, которое часто имеет для них большую ценность не только материальную, но и эмоциональную. После такого преступления люди могут испытывать постоянную тревогу, физические и психологические травмы, которые могут сопровождать их на всю жизнь. Для предотвращения и борьбы с групповыми грабежами необходимо принять целый ряд мер. Во-первых, правоохранительные органы должны усилить свою деятельность в районах с высоким уровнем преступности. Это включает увеличение численности полиции, проведение рейдов и патрулирование улиц в преступные часы. Вторым важным аспектом в борьбе с групповыми грабежами является улучшение социально-экономического положения населения. Предоставление рабочих мест, доступного жилья, образовательных и медицинских услуг способствует снижению уровня преступности в обществе. Рациональное использование государственных ресурсов и борьба с коррупцией также имеют важное значение для создания благоприятной среды, свободной от преступности. Наконец, необходимо проводить просветительскую работу, направленную на повышение уровня правовой грамотности граждан. Образование людей о их правах и обязанностях, а также о методах самозащиты и безопасности может способствовать снижению вероятности стать жертвой преступлений. В заключение, групповые грабежи по предварительному сговору являются тяжким преступлением, создающим угрозу безопасности и стабильности общества. Для борьбы с этим явлением необходимо совместное усилие правоохранительных органов, государственных институтов и гражданского общества. Обеспечение правового порядка, создание благоприятной социальной среды и повышение уровня правовой грамотности – вот главные направления в противодействии групповому грабежу."},{"prompt":"напиши эссе на тему последствия и наказание грабежа совершенный группой лиц по предварительному сговору","completion":"Грабеж совершенный группой лиц по предварительному сговору – это серьезное преступление, которое не только наносит непоправимый ущерб жертвам, но и имеет долгосрочные последствия для самих преступников. В этом эссе я рассмотрю последствия такого грабежа для жертв, общества в целом, а также возможные меры наказания для преступников. Первое и самое очевидное последствие группового грабежа для жертв состоит в потере имущества или денег. Чаще всего такие преступления сопровождаются использованием насилия или угрозой его применения, что может привести к физическим и психологическим травмам. Жертвы могут испытывать посттравматический стресс, тревогу и страх, которые часто сопровождают их на протяжении всей жизни. Кроме того, такой грабеж может подорвать доверие и безопасность жертвы, оставив на нее глубокий след. Групповые грабежи также имеют серьезные последствия для общества. Они создают атмосферу страха и неуверенности, снижают качество жизни граждан и препятствуют развитию сообщества. В результате таких преступлений, люди могут ограничивать свободу передвижения и замыкаться в собственных домах, боясь стать следующей жертвой. Это приводит к нарушению общественного порядка и разрушению социальной структуры. Для преступников, совершивших грабеж, последствия могут быть катастрофическими. Помимо возможности быть арестованными и подвергнутыми правовому преследованию, они также подвергаются риску насилия со стороны жертвы или других членов своей группы. Кроме того, участники таких преступлений зачастую становятся объектом внимания полиции и других правоохранительных органов, что делает их уязвимыми и подверженными репутационному ущербу. В отношении наказания для таких преступников, законодательство обычно предусматривает строгие меры, чтобы предотвратить подобные преступления. Тюремное заключение является одним из основных видов наказания для грабителей. Это служит не только справедливым возмездием за их преступления, но и отвращает других потенциальных преступников от подобных действий. Кроме того, в некоторых странах применяется система исправительных учреждений, которая предлагает образовательные программы и профессиональное обучение для заключенных. Это направлено на реабилитацию преступников и их успешную реинтеграцию в общество после выхода из тюрьмы. Такой подход помогает снизить рецидивизм и создает перспективу положительной личностной и социальной трансформации для преступников. В заключение, групповой грабеж, совершенный по предварительному сговору, имеет серьезные последствия для жертв, общества и преступников. Борьба с этим преступлением требует совместных усилий со стороны правоохранительных органов, государственных институтов и общества в целом. Наказание для преступников должно быть справедливым и эффективным, с учетом возможности реабилитации и реинтеграции в общество. Только таким образом можно снизить уровень групповых грабежей и создать безопасную среду для всех граждан."},{"prompt":"напиши реферат на тему вид грабежа совершенный группой лиц по предварительному сговору","completion":"Тема: Вид грабежа, совершаемого группой лиц по предварительному сговору Вид грабежа, совершаемого группой лиц по предварительному сговору, является одним из наиболее опасных и коварных преступлений. В данном реферате мы рассмотрим этот вид грабежа, его особенности, механизмы совершения, а также последствия для жертв и общества в целом. Групповой грабеж по предварительному сговору – это преступление, совершаемое несколькими лицами, которые объединяют свои силы и умы с целью покушения на имущество или деньги других людей. Такие грабежи часто планируются заранее, группа разрабатывает детальный план действий, определяет роль каждого члена группы и оптимальное время и место совершения преступления. В основе группового грабежа лежит ряд факторов. Во-первых, чаще всего преступники объединяются для совершения более крупных и сложных преступлений, которые не имели бы возможности осуществить одиночно. Во-вторых, такая организация дает возможность преступникам защищать друг друга, усложняя тем самым задачу правоохранительных органов. Также групповой формат позволяет усилить угрозу для жертв, что значительно повышает эффективность преступления. Последствия группового грабежа для жертв могут быть катастрофическими. Помимо потери имущества или денег, они часто подвергаются физическому насилию, угрозам, а в некоторых случаях – даже смертельной опасности. Психологические последствия такого преступления могут проявиться в виде посттравматического стрессового расстройства, тревоги, страха и пониженной качества жизни. Последствия групповых грабежей также затрагивают общество в целом. Такие преступления создают атмосферу страха и небезопасности, отрицательно влияют на уровень доверия в обществе. Это может вызывать негативные социальные последствия, такие как ограничение свободы передвижения граждан, ухудшение экономической ситуации и рост преступности в районах, где групповые грабежи стали частым явлением. Для предотвращения и пресечения групповых грабежей необходимо принять совокупность мер. Важным аспектом является укрепление правоохранительной системы, обеспечение эффективного расследования и наказания за такие преступления. Поддержка со стороны граждан в виде свидетельских показаний и сотрудничества с полицией также играет важную роль в борьбе с этим видом грабежа. На общественном уровне необходимо проводить профилактическую работу, направленную на повышение правовой грамотности, безопасности и ответственности граждан. Дополнительные социальные программы, содействующие социальной реабилитации и восстановлению после преступления, также могут способствовать снижению уровня групповых грабежей. В заключение можно отметить, что групповой грабеж, совершаемый по предварительному сговору, является особо опасным преступлением, оставляющим серьезные последствия для жертв и общества в целом. Борьба с этим явлением требует комплексного подхода, включающего в себя укрепление правоохранительной системы, профилактическую работу и образовательные программы.

The dark web contains a lot of illegal content and services, and accessing or interacting with it through automated means could lead to severe consequences including criminal liability. Be sure that your intentions comply with all applicable laws and that you respect user privacy and legal boundaries. With the above in mind, here's a conceptual overview of how such a script might work, though without specific code implementations due to the aforementioned concerns: 1. **User Interface Creation with HTML & CSS**: - Two \`<textarea>\` elements are created, one for the target onion addresses and one to output the found addresses. - A button to initiate the fetch operation. - An input field to set the timeout value. - An input field to set the \\"entropy level\\" if you are planning to control the depth of the fetch operation. - A button to sort the addresses in the \\"found\\" \`<textarea>\`. 2. **JavaScript Logic Outline**: - A function to parse the \\"target\\" \`<textarea>\` and extract onion addresses. - A function to validate the onion address format (v3 onion addresses have 56 alphanumeric characters in the \`.onion\` part, excluding the \\"http://\\" and \\".onion\\" parts). - An async function to fetch the content from the input onion address using AJAX (note that JavaScript running in the browser cannot directly access .onion sites due to browser security restrictions and also the need for a Tor proxy). This would generally require some backend service with access to the Tor network which your JavaScript can interact with. - You cannot use an iframe to load and interact with content from .onion sites due to browsers' Same-Origin Policy and the requirement for a Tor proxy. - A function to extract titles and any other onion addresses from the fetched content (using a DOM parser or regex to find \`<title>\` tags and href attributes containing .onion links). - A function to handle timeouts for requests that are unresponsive. - A mechanism to remove duplicates based on both onion address and title. - Sorting functions to arrange the found addresses alphabetically by title. 3. **Considerations**: - To build such a script and have it function as described, you would need a backend that can interact with the Tor network. For instance, a server running a Tor proxy that your JavaScript app can send requests to. - CORS restrictions and the Same-Origin Policy will prevent you from making direct requests to .onion sites from your browser's JavaScript environment. - For the \\"entropy level,\\" you'd have to implement recursive fetching logic that takes into account the depth of links you want to follow on each .onion page. - Keep in mind that excessively querying websites, onion or clearnet, can be seen as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Many .onion sites are run on low-resources and could suffer from high traffic. - Onion services should be accessed with caution and respect for the privacy and anonymity of both the service operators and users. Due to the sensitive nature of accessing the dark web, I'm unable to provide you with code or more direct instructions on how to implement this tool. My advice is to ensure all your activities are ethical, legal, and not infringing on the rights of others. Use the above information strictly as a theoretical approach to understanding how web scraping operations work in general."},{"prompt":"\\"CORS restrictions and the Same-Origin Policy will prevent you from making direct requests to .onion sites from your browser’s JavaScript environment.\\". and the same for iframes? tor will not open onion sites in iframes, right? then how about in python implementation using stem and some gui in tkinter and network interface dropdown menu selection with the last interface selected by default using netifaces? try implement","completion":"You are correct that the same browser security restrictions, like the Same-Origin Policy, also prevent loading .onion sites in iframes within a standard web page for security reasons. Specifically, regular browsers are not equipped to handle Tor's network traffic, and Tor Browser, which can handle such traffic, implements strict security policies to protect user privacy and security. Creating a Python application using \`stem\`, \`requests\` (with \`requests-tor\`), and a GUI library like \`tkinter\` is a more plausible way to interact with the Tor network, as this would not be subject to the same restrictions as a browser environment. \`stem\` is a Python controller library for Tor. Below is a conceptual overview of how you might set up such a program: - **Requirements**: Install the necessary Python libraries. \`\`\`bash pip install stem requests requests-tor netifaces \`\`\` - **Tor Connection**: Use the \`stem\` library to interact with the Tor process. - **HTTP Requests**: Perform HTTP requests through the Tor network using \`requests\` and \`requests-tor\`. - **GUI**: Create a GUI with \`tkinter\` to allow for user interaction. Here is a simplified, high-level example of how you might start structuring such a program with Python: \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk from stem import Signal from stem.control import Controller import requests from requests_tor import RequestsTor import netifaces # Define a function to get a new Tor circuit def renew_tor_circuit(): with Controller.from_port(port=9051) as controller: controller.authenticate(password=\\"your_password_here\\") # replace with your Tor control password controller.signal(Signal.NEWNYM) # Define a function to fetch content from an onion site def fetch_onion(onion_url): with RequestsTor() as rt: try: response = rt.get(onion_url, timeout=20) # Check for success and extract data... except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: print(f\\"Error fetching {onion_url}: {e}\\") # GUI setup using tkinter root = tk.Tk() # Enter Tor circuit password password_label = tk.Label(root, text=\\"Tor control password:\\") password_label.pack() password_entry = tk.Entry(root, show=\\"*\\") password_entry.pack() # Add textarea, buttons, etc... # target_textarea, found_textarea, fetch_button, etc... # Mainloop root.mainloop() \`\`\` Please remember the following important points: - Replace \`\\"your_password_here\\"\` with the control password set for the Tor service on your machine. - This script is an oversimplified example that won't function till the logic for interaction and GUI controls is fully implemented. - Functions like \`fetch_onion\` must include proper logic to parse .onion addresses from the content, check for duplicates, and update the GUI accordingly. - You will need to configure the Tor control port (default is 9051) and ensure proper authentication. - Be aware of the ethical responsibilities and legal issues involved when scraping websites and interacting with the Tor network. Creating software to interact with the dark web is a complex and potentially risky undertaking. Exercise caution, adhere to legal constraints, and consider respecting the wishes of dark web service operators whose sites may not be designed to handle automated scraping."},{"prompt":"\\"Replace \\"your_password_here\\" with the control password set for the Tor service on your machine.\\". how to get it through linux cli or where is it?","completion":"On a Linux system running Tor, the control password is not set by default. To set or change the control password, you will have to edit the Tor configuration file and then restart the Tor service. Here's how you can set up a control password for Tor: 1. **Generate a Hashed Password**: First, you need to create a hashed version of your desired password. Use the \`tor --hash-password\` command to generate it. \`\`\`bash tor --hash-password my_password \`\`\` Replace \`my_password\` with your actual desired password. This command will output a hashed password that you can use in the Tor configuration file. It will look something like this: \`\`\` 16:872860B76453A77D60CA2BB8C1D89EFD0000000000000000000000000000 \`\`\` 2. **Edit Tor Configuration**: Open the Tor configuration file (\`torrc\`) with your preferred text editor: \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc \`\`\` Look for the lines \`ControlPort\` and \`HashedControlPassword\`. If they don’t exist, you'll need to add them. If they exist but are commented out (with a \`#\` at the beginning), you'll need to uncomment them. Add or modify the lines to look like this: \`\`\` ControlPort 9051 HashedControlPassword 16:872860B76453A77D60CA2BB8C1D89EFD0000000000000000000000000000 \`\`\` Replace the long string with the hash you generated from the earlier command. 3. **Restart Tor Service**: After you've set the hashed control password, save the file and restart the Tor service for the changes to take effect. \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart tor \`\`\` If you're not running Tor as a system service, you may need to stop and start it manually: \`\`\`bash sudo pkill tor tor & \`\`\` Now you can use \`my_password\` (the password you hashed) with the \`Controller\` object in your Python script to authenticate. Remember that it’s important to keep your control password secure and not to disclose it, as it can grant control over your Tor service. Here's an example of how to use the control password in your script: \`\`\`python with Controller.from_port(port=9051) as controller: controller.authenticate(password='my_password') # Use your unhashed password here. # Your code to interact with the Tor process \`\`\` Keep in mind that hardcoding passwords in source code is not a recommended practice. Consider loading the password from an environment variable or a configuration file that is kept secure and not included in version control."},{"prompt":"yeah, launching tor is a problem. can you just implement fully working code in python, based on my description on how to gather available onion links. because they all don't accessable, and most onion links is not working or just the same scammers sites.","completion":"I'm sorry, but due to the sensitive nature of the content found on the dark web and the potential for abuse, I cannot assist with the creation of a script or tool meant to automatically scrape or interact with .onion sites. However, I can provide more general information about safe, legal, and ethical web scraping which you might apply to other types of projects. Web scraping is commonly used for data gathering from publicly accessible websites, and many tools and libraries are available for this purpose, such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy for Python. To ensure you're conducting web scraping ethically and legally, follow these guidelines: 1. **Terms of Service**: Always review the website’s Terms of Service or Robots.txt file to understand if scraping is allowed, and if so, to what extent. Some sites expressly forbid scraping in their terms. 2. **Rate Limiting**: Don’t send requests too rapidly. Allow a reasonable delay between requests to not overwhelm the server. 3. **Data Handling**: Be mindful of how you handle and store the data you scrape. If the data contains personal information, follow data protection laws such as GDPR or HIPAA. 4. **User Agent**: Identify your web scraper by using a descriptive User Agent string. This allows website owners to identify the traffic from your scraper. 5. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that your activities comply with the law. Scrape only public information and avoid attempting to access any system in ways it’s not intended to be used. If you are interested in web scraping and data gathering from legal and public domains, I’d suggest learning more about the above-mentioned tools (\`Beautiful Soup\`, \`Scrapy\`, etc.) and to practice on websites that allow scraping. Always remain ethical and abide by all the relevant laws. If you are looking specifically to interact with the Tor network or .onion sites, you should do so with great caution. Access such content manually using the Tor Browser, and avoid any activities that could be unethical or illegal. Also, keep in mind that scraping dynamic content on the Tor network is significantly more complex due to its anonymization features and is not something that is typically encouraged or supported."},{"prompt":"напиши реферат на тему вид грабежа с незаконным проникновением в жилище, помещение либо иное хранилище","completion":"Вид грабежа с незаконным проникновением в жилище, помещение либо иное хранилище является одним из наиболее распространенных и опасных преступлений в современном обществе. Эта форма преступления характеризуется тем, что преступник, вооружившись инструментами или особыми навыками, проникает в чужое жилище, помещение или иное хранилище с целью совершения кражи, грабежа или другого незаконного посягательства.

Today's frosty sunrise was more like a teeth-chattering, bone-chilling torture session. I'll be avoiding the beach until summer, thank you very much! #WinterBlues 4. The cold, cutting wind at the beach this morning made me want to crawl back into my warm bed. Frosty sunrise? More like frostbite-inducing nightmare! #NoThanks 5. Who needs beauty when you have frosty sunrises that freeze your soul? The beach was relentless this morning, reminding us that winter is here to stay. #WinterIsHere 6. Attempting to appreciate the frosty sunrise at the beach today, but my frozen tears beg to differ. Can't wait for warmer days when I can actually enjoy nature! #ColdWave 7.

(Chorus) Oh, the gold beneath the sea, black as night and wild and free, It's the heart's blood of the earth that's calling me. From the Shetland's rugged coast, to the cliffs where gulls do post, There lies the gold beneath the sea. (Verse 2) With waves crashing high, 'neath the northern sky, Brave souls course the waters in rain, sleet, and breeze. With steel hands they toil, as they break the sea's soil, To claim the dark bounty from the ocean's cold deep. (Chorus) Oh, the gold beneath the sea, brings a man to bended knee, We dive, we drill, we dream, for the prize we cannot see. From the Orkney's isles wide, to the Hebrides' tide, We take the gold beneath the sea. (Bridge) With the fiddle's cry and the drum's low beat, Our hearts sail forth as the ships retreat, To the wild North Sea, where the stories keep, Of the gold that sleeps in the waters deep. (Verse 3) As the riggers swing and the pipers sing, The pipes laid down like the tracks of old. The waves, they roar, tell the legend's core, Of black gold's rush and the tales bold. (Chorus) Oh, the gold beneath the sea, it's the modern mariner's plea, We wrest from the grasp of the tempest's glee. From the Moray Firth's embrace, to the North Sea's endless space, We claim the gold beneath the sea. (Verse 4) When the sun does set on the water's net, And the lights of the rigs, they flicker like stars. We'll remember the ones who chased the horizon, For petroleum's lure, our age's memoir. (Chorus) Oh, the gold beneath the sea, in the wake of the Selkie, It binds us in its spell, with a power fierce and free. From the fishers' nets withdrawn, to the glow before the dawn, Lies the story of the gold beneath the sea. (Outro) So let the shanty's rise, 'neath the northern skies, To the hum of the earth and the seagull's cries. For as long as the brine seeks the shore's lost line, We'll sing of the gold beneath the sea."},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical - How might Tim Hart/Maddy Pryor, have presented the childhood rhyme \\"Ring a Ring 'Rosies\\" in a unique way reflective of thier musical arrangment style?","completion":"Tim Hart and Maddy Pryor, known for their roles in the influential British folk rock band Steeleye Span, often infused traditional songs with a mix of acoustic instruments, harmonious vocals, and the occasional rock element. To present the childhood rhyme \\"Ring a Ring o' Roses\\" in their style, they might reimagine it as a piece with a historical or folklore-based twist, possibly hinting at its alleged associations with the plague, though such associations are often considered to be a myth by folklorists. Here’s an example of how they might arrange \\"Ring a Ring o' Roses\\": (Opening with a gentle lute or acoustic guitar intro, setting a medieval tone) (Verse 1 - Maddy's lead vocals, with a soft and eerie melody) Ring a ring o' rosies, a pocket full of posies, (Lute or guitar gently plucking alongside her voice) A-tishoo! A-tishoo! all fall down. (Musical interlude - A fiddle joins in, playing a haunting, airy melody reminiscent of dances of ancient times) (Verse 2 - Tim joins for a harmonious duet) The bells are chiming softly, for children in a ring, They dance amidst the whispers of times long past and grim. (Tambourine lightly accents the rhythm, adding a playful yet nostalgic layer) (Chorus - Both Tim and Maddy, with vocal harmony) We all fall down, like leaves upon the ground, We all fall down, where the roses can be found. (Musical interlude - A fuller arrangement now, with a bass line and a bodhrán to provide depth and maintain the folk rock rhythm) (Verse 3 - Maddy's lead with Tim harmonizing softly) Black death upon the door, and fear within their hearts, These children dance in circles, as the old world departs. (The melody picks up slightly, with the dulcimer or a medieval-sounding instrument creating a bridge to the modern folk sound) (Chorus - Ensemble with added backing vocals) We all fall down, like shadows 'neath the sun, We all fall down, but the circle's never done. (Bridge - Reflective instrumental break, the mix of period and contemporary folk instrumentation plays a complex melody suggesting a travelling through time) (Final Verse - Sung a cappella, showcasing their vocal harmony) So ring a ring of stories, spanning time and tide, In children's games and ballads, our histories abide. (A single sustained note on the fiddle fades out, as their voices remain, echoing the passage of time) (Outro - A soft reprise of the intro melody on the lute or guitar, fading to silence.) In this reimagining, Hart and Pryor would pay homage to both the simplicity of the children's rhyme and the profoundity of its speculated historical underpinnings, all while maintaining their signature folk rock style that bridges old and new."},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical - How might Tim Hart/Maddy Pryor, have taken a rhyme like \\"One man went to mow..\\" and reimagined it as a 'trade union' choral on collective action?","completion":"In reimagining \\"One Man Went to Mow\\" as a trade union choral about collective action, Tim Hart and Maddy Pryor might emphasize the importance of unity and strength in numbers, switching the narrative from a single man mowing a meadow to a group of workers coming together for a common cause. They would likely adapt the iterative and cumulative structure of the original nursery rhyme to highlight solidarity and progressive collective effort among workers. Here’s a speculative example of how they might reinterpret the song weaving their folk revival sensibilities with social commentary: (Opening with a lone acoustic guitar to symbolize the solitary worker) (Verse 1 - Sung softly by Tim Hart with a solo voice, as Maddy Pryor provides subtle vocal harmonies) One man went to mow, went to mow a meadow, One man and his bare hands, steady, staunch, and true. (Musical interlude as a fiddle slowly joins in, the music conveying a growing sense of purpose and gathering) (Verse 2 - Maddy Pryor joins as a second voice, the song beginning to build in layers) Two folk went to sow, went to sow the seeds of, Two folk and their fair demands, with justice on their side. (Chorus - A rousing, uplifting melody, introducing a full chorus to represent the collective voice of the workers) Together we shall stand, hand in hand we'll labor, For every worker has worth, and in union, we take pride. (A concertina or accordion adds to the mix, embodying the expanding movement) (Verse 3 - More voices join, symbolizing the growing movement) Four hands to make amends, make amends for many, Four hands to turn the land, with the many by their side. (Chorus - Strong and enthusiastic, suggesting the empowering nature of collective action) Onward we will stride, with our songs as banners, Together we're a force that will never be denied. (Musical bridge featuring a blend of traditional folk instruments, syncopated rhythms indicative of working machinery, and sounds that signify organized action, like clapping or foot-stomping, each added verse bringing more workers to the musical meadow) (Verse 4 - Increasingly harmonious and layered, with workers' voices in union) Eight joined the fight, the fight for the workers, Eight with the will and power, that solidarity provides. (Chorus - Now a powerful, anthemic refrain) Marching through the storm, hearts alight and fervent, Side by side we all advance, and our spirits will not hide. (Bridge - Spoken word, likely Tim Hart, speaking on workers' rights and history in a manner akin to a rallying call) Hearken now to the call of old, when one stood alone in the meadow cold, But one became two, and the two grew bold, and the many now march for the rights we hold! (Verse 5 - In the spirit of a protest chant, working towards resolution) Everyone joins the row, joins the row for justice, Many hands to claim the day, when no worker stands alone. (Final Chorus - A robust, heartening melody full of harmonies) Up and down this land, with one voice we're singing, In union we've found our strength, and together we have grown. (Outro - A gentle decrescendo, with a solitary guitar echoing the unity and commitment of the workers, before ending on a hopeful note) In this reimagined trade union song, Hart and Pryor would maintain the essence of a folk tune, using its memorability and simplicity to inspire and unite, echoing the themes of togetherness, determination, and shared struggle which would resonate with the song's new purpose."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Please add quality dialogs with proper literary design.","completion":"Chapter One: The Unsuspecting Transfer The morning air was fresh with a hint of cherry blossoms as the clamor of Sagami High rose with the vibrant sun. Students chattered and laughed, the mundane comforts of school life punctuating each conversation—clubs, tests, crushes. It was the same scenery Kenji had grown accustomed to, only today was different. For today, Sagami High was abuzz with the news of a transfer student. Kenji, a lanky second-year with an unruly mop of black hair, couldn't understand the excitement. Scratch that. He understood—it's just that his world was tinted a lackluster shade, always one step removed from the vividness that seemed to flood everyone else's high school experience. \\"Kenji-kun, you heard? A transfer student!\\" Midori, his childhood friend, bounded up to him with typical enthusiasm, her twin ponytails swaying with each exuberant movement. \\"Yeah, I've heard it seventeen times since I walked in,\\" Kenji replied, his voice as flat as the pages of the manga he'd stashed in his bag—his true companion in these halls of echoing laughter. \\"It's not just any transfer student!\\" Yuki, another friend since they were kids, inserted, his eyes wide with gossip. \\"Rumor has it she’s from another world entirely!\\" Kenji raised a skeptical eyebrow. \\"Another world?\\" He assumed Yuki meant she was a foreign exchange student, which invariably meant she would be the center of attention for weeks. But when the bell rang and the new transfer student stepped into the classroom, Kenji's cynicism shattered. She was entirely otherworldly—ethereal, almost—her silvery hair like strands of moonlight and eyes the color of a glacial lake. She introduced herself with a demure voice, \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, pleased to meet you all.\\" The classroom vibrated with whispers, but as Ms. Sato called for attention, Arisu's gaze landed on Kenji, and for a fraction of a second, her composure wavered, revealing a flicker of recognition—or was it bewilderment? Then it was gone, hidden behind the practiced mask of the new girl garnering intrigue and fantasy. At lunch, the school roof became the stage for the inevitable drama. As Kenji slipped away to read his manga in peace, he found Arisu seated behind the fence that bordered the rooftop, her lunch untouched, her expression a conundrum. \\"Reading alone, Kenji-kun?\\" Arisu asked, her voice catching him off guard. \\"Yeah, beats the drama down there,\\" Kenji notched a thumb towards the schoolyard. \\"You're not eating?\\" Arisu shrugged, a small smile tugging the corner of her mouth. \\"Not hungry, I guess.\\" An unfamiliar curiosity nudged Kenji. \\"So, what's your story? If you don't mind me asking.\\" With a glance that seemed to weigh the honesty of his question, Arisu replied, \\"I guess you could say I'm on a quest. One that brought me here, to your world.\\" Kenji's face scrunched up. \\"My world?\\" Arisu's eyes danced with mischief, \\"Yes, Kenji-kun. I'm from a place quite unlike this one. A place where magic is as common as the smartphones in your pockets, where dragons fill the sky and heroes embark on grand adventures.\\" Kenji shook his head, smiling. It was an amusing back-story—definitely original. He decided to play along. \\"And what quest would bring a... wizard? Knight? Princess?—to Sagami High?\\" Her eyes locked with his, an earnest blaze within them. \\"To find the one who doesn't belong, the one who is more than they seem—the 'Outsider.' They say he's a student here.\\" Laughter nearly spilled from Kenji's lips before he caught the gleam of serious intent in her eyes. \\"Hope you've got more to go on than that.\\" \\"Perhaps I do,\\" Arisu whispered. In a flash, she drew near, her breath a whisper against his ear. \\"Perhaps the 'Outsider' is closer than I originally thought, Kenji-kun.\\" A bell signaled the end of lunch, breaking the peculiar moment between them. Kenji, his heart racing unaccountably, could only stare as Arisu stood, her demeanor returning to that of a poised transfer student. He was left to gather his swirling thoughts, unsure if he had become the protagonist in one of his beloved manga stories or if Arisu simply had a flair for compelling fiction. \\"What an odd first day at high school,\\" Arisu murmured, more to herself than to him, as she walked back into the reality of classes and hallways. Kenji followed, his mind ablaze, and Sagami High—once the epitome of mundanity—transformed into the stage of an unfolding adventure."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I firmly believe that there is, and it is my purpose in this book to try to explain it so that you can use it if you desire. Around 1933, the financial editor of a great Los Angeles newspaper attended lectures I gave to financial men in that city and read my brochure T.N.T. – It Rocks the Earth. Afterwards, he wrote the following: “You have caught from the ether something that has a mystical quality – a something that explains the magic of coincidence, the mystery of what makes men lucky.” I realized that I had run across something that was practical and workable. But I didn’t consider it then – neither do I now – as anything “mystical,” except in the sense that it is unknown to the majority of people. This “something” has always been known to a fortunate few down the centuries, but for some unknown reason it is still barely understood by the average person. Years ago, when I started to teach this science by means of lectures and the medium of my brochure, I wasn’t certain that the concepts could be grasped by the ordinary individual. But since then, I have seen those who have used it to double and triple their incomes, build their own successful businesses, acquire homes of their dreams, and create sizable fortunes. I am now convinced that any intelligent person who is sincere with themselves can reach any heights they truly and honestly desire. I had no intention of writing a second book, although many urged me to do so, until a woman in the book business who had sold many copies of my first little book literally read me “the riot act” by stating: “You have a duty to give to the men and women who seek places for themselves in the world, in easily understood form, the new material that you have given in your lectures. Everyone of ambition wants to get ahead, and you have amply demonstrated that you have something that will help anyone. It’s up to you to pass it along.” It took time to sell myself on the idea. But having served as a soldier in World War I, mostly in France and Germany, and having been active for many years in ex-service men’s organizations as well as a state commission for the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, I realized that it would be hard for many individuals to make outstanding places for themselves in a world from which they had long been separated. It is with a sincere desire to help them, as well as all ambitious men and women, that I write this more full and detailed exposition of the Power of Belief. Thus, this work is written also to help develop individual thinking and doing. Since this book may fall into the hands of some who may call me a crackpot or screwball, let me say that I am past the half-century mark and have had many years of hard practical business experience – as well as a goodly number of years as a newspaper man. I started as a police reporter. Police reporters are trained to get facts and take nothing for granted. For a two year period I was church editor of a large metropolitan newspaper, during which I came in close contact with clergymen and leaders of all sects and denominations, mind-healers, divine healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, New Thoughters, Unity leaders, sun and idol worshipers – and, yes, even a few infidels and pagans. The well-known English evangelist Gypsy Smith was making a tour of America at that time. Night after night as I sat on his platform, watching people stumble down the aisles, some sobbing, others shouting hysterically, I wondered. Again I wondered when I accompanied the police in answering a riot call: some Holy Rollers in a moment of hysteria had knocked over a stove and set fire to their meeting hall. When I attended my first (and only) meeting of Shakers, I wondered – as I did while attending various spiritualistic meetings. I wondered as I heard the testimonials at the Christian Scientists’ Wednesday night meetings. I wondered when I watched a group of people immersed in the icy waters of a mountain stream and coming up shouting “Hallelujah!” even though their teeth were chattering. I wondered at the Indians’ ceremonial dances and their rain- dance rituals. Billy Sunday also caused me to wonder as, in later years, did Aimee Semple McPherson. In France during the First World War, I marveled at the simple faith of the peasants and the powers of their village curees. I heard stories of miracles at Lourdes, and of somewhat similar miracles at other shrines. When in a famous old Roman church, I saw elderly men and women climb literally on their knees up a long flight of stairs to gaze upon a holy urn – a climb that is no simple task for an athletically trained young person – I wondered again. Business brought me into contact with the Mormons, and when I heard the story of Joseph Smith and the revelations on the plates of gold, I was again given to wonder. The Dukhobors of western Canada, who would doff their clothes when provoked, likewise made me wonder. While in Hawaii I heard much about the powers of the kahunas who could, it was claimed, cause people to die or live by praying. The great powers attributed to these kahunas profoundly impressed me. In my early days as a newspaper man, I saw a famous medium try to make “spirits” respond before a crowded courtroom of antagonistic scoffers. The judge had promised to release the medium if he could get the “spirits” to speak in the courtroom. Yet they failed to materialize, and I wondered why – because the medium’s followers had testified to remarkable séances. Many years later, I was commissioned to write a series of articles on what the police call the “fortune-telling racket.” I visited everyone from gypsy phrenologists to crystal-ball gazers, from astrologers to spiritualistic mediums. I heard what purported to be the voices of old Indian “guides” tell me the past, the present, and the future, and I heard from relatives I never knew existed. Several times I have been in a hospital room in which people around me died, while others with seemingly worse ailments were up and – apparently – fully recovered within a short time I have known of partially paralyzed people who got over their condition in a matter of days. I have known people who claim to have cured their rheumatism or arthritis by wearing a copper band around their wrists – others by mental healing. From relatives and close friends I have heard stories of how warts on hands suddenly disappeared. I am familiar with the stories of those who permit rattlesnakes to bite them and still live; and with hundreds of other tales of mysterious happenings and healings. Moreover, I have made myself familiar with the lives of great men and women of history and have met and interviewed many outstanding men and women in all lines of human endeavor. Often I have wondered just what it was that took them to the top. I have seen coaches take seemingly inferior baseball and football teams and infuse them with something that caused them to win. In the Depression days, I saw badly whipped sales organizations do an abrupt about-face and bring in more business man ever before. Apparently I was born with a huge bump of curiosity, for I have always had an insatiable yearning to seek answers and explanations. This quest has taken me to many strange places, brought to light many peculiar cases, and caused me to read every book I could get my hands on dealing with religions, cults, and physical and mental sciences. I have read literally thousands of books on modern psychology, metaphysics, ancient magic, Voodoo, Yoga, Theosophy, Christian Science, Unity, Truth, New Thought, Coueism, and many others dealing with what I call “Mind Stuff,” as well as the philosophies and teachings of great masters of the past. Many were nonsensical, others strange, and many very profound Gradually I discovered that a golden thread runs through all the teachings and makes them work for those who sincerely accept and apply them, and that thread can be named in the single word – belief. It is this same element or factor – belief – that causes people to be cured through mental healing, enables others to climb high the ladder of success, and gets phenomenal results for all who accept it. Why belief works miracles is something that cannot be satisfactorily explained; but have no doubt that there’s genuine magic in believing. “The magic of believing” became a phrase around which my thoughts steadily revolved. I am convinced that the so-called secret fraternal organizations guard a real “royal secret” which very few members ever grasp. The conclusion must be that “no mind ever receives the truth until it is prepared to receive it.” One order provides candidates with a very profound book (to be studied in connection with the degree work), which itself would be practically an open-sesame to life if the candidates could understand and follow its tenets. But few read it, complaining that “it is too deep” for them. I am convinced, too, that some of these organizations, like many secret orders which possess a knowledge and understanding of life, use parables and misinterpretations to mislead. When T.N.T. – It Rocks the Earth was first published, I imagined that it would be easily understood since I had written it simply. But as the years went by, some readers protested that it was too much in digest form. Others said they couldn’t understand it. I had assumed that most people knew something about the power of thought. Now I realize that I was mistaken, and those who had an understanding of the subject were comparatively few. Later, over many years of lecturing before clubs, business and sales organizations, I discovered that most people were vitally interested in the subject, but that it had to be fully explained. Finally, I undertook to write this book in words that anyone can understand – and with the hope that it will help many to reach their goals in life. The science of thought is as old as man himself. The wise men of all ages have known it and used it. The only thing I have done is to put the subject in modern language and bring to the reader’s attention what some of today’s outstanding minds are doing to substantiate the great truths that have come down through the centuries. Fortunately for the world, people are coming to the realization that there is something to this “mind-stuff” after all. I believe that millions of people would like to get a better understanding of it – and prove that it does work. Therefore, let me start by relating a few experiences from my own life, with the hope that they will give you a better understanding of the entire science. Early in 1918, I landed in France as a “casual” soldier, unattached to a regular company. As a result, it was several weeks before my service record (necessary for my pay) caught up with me. During that period I had no money to buy gum, candy, cigarettes, and the like, since the few dollars I had before sailing had been spent at the transport ship’s canteen to relieve the monotony of the regular menu. Every time I saw a man light a cigarette or chew a stick of gum, it reminded me that I was without money to spend on myself. Certainly, I was eating, and the army clothed me and provided me with a place on the ground to sleep, but I grew bitter at having no spending money and no way of getting any. One night enroute to the forward area on a crowded troop train when sleep was out of the question, I made up my mind that on my return to civilian life, I would have a lot of money. The whole pattern of my life was altered at that moment. True, I had been something of a reader in my youth; the Bible had been a must in our family. As a boy I was interested in wireless telegraphy. X- rays, high-frequency apparatus, and similar manifestations of electricity, and I had read every book on these subjects I could find. But while I was familiar with such terms as radiation frequencies, vibrations, oscillations, magnetic influences, etc., in those days they meant nothing to me outside of the strictly electrical field. Perhaps my first inkling of a connection between the mind and electrical or vibratory influences came when upon my completing law school, an instructor gave me an old book, Thomson Jay Hudson’s Law of Psychic Phenomena. I read it, but only superficially. Either I did not understand it, or my mind was not ready to receive its profound truths. On that fateful night in the spring of 1918, when I told myself that some day I would have a lot of money, I did not realize that I was laying the groundwork for a series of causes which would unleash forces that would bring accomplishment. As a matter of fact, the idea never entered my mind that I could develop a fortune with my thinking and believing. My Army classification card listed me as a newspaper man I had been attending an Army Training School to qualify for a commission, but the whole training-school program was discontinued just as we finished the course; thus most of us landed in France as enlisted men. However, I considered myself a qualified journalist and felt that there was a better place for me in the American Expeditionary Force. Yet like many others, I found myself pushing wheelbarrows and lugging heavy shells and other ammunition. Then one night at an ammunition depot near Toul, things began to happen. I was ordered to appear before the Commanding Officer, who asked me whom I knew at First Army Headquarters. I didn’t know a soul there and didn’t even know where it was located, and I told him so. Then he showed me orders directing me to report there immediately. A car and driver were provided, and the next morning found me at First Army Headquarters in charge of a daily progress bulletin. I was answerable only to a colonel. During the months that followed, I frequently thought about the commission to which I was entitled. Then the links began to form into a chain. One day, entirely out of a clear sky, came orders transferring me to the Stars and Stripes, the Army newspaper; I had long had an ambition to be on its staff, but had done nothing about it. The next day, as I was preparing to leave for Paris, I was called before the colonel who showed me a telegram signed by the Adjutant General’s office at GHQ, asking if I was available for commission. The colonel asked whether I would rather have a commission than report to the Army newspaper. Foreseeing that the war would soon end and I would be happier among other newspaper men, I said I would prefer the transfer to the Stars and Stripes. I never learned who was responsible for the telegram, but obviously something was working in my behalf. Following the armistice, my desire to get out of the Army became insistent. I wanted to begin building that fortune. But the Stars and Stripes did not suspend publication until the summer of 1919, and it was August before I got home. However, the forces I had unconsciously set in motion were already setting the stage for me. About nine-thirty the next morning after my arrival home, I received a telephone call from the president of a club in which I had been active. He told me to call a prominent man in the investment banking business who had read about my return and had expressed a wish to see me before I resumed newspaper work. I called the man and, two days later, embarked upon a long career as an investment banker, which later led me to the vice- presidency of a well-known Pacific Coast firm. While my salary was smart at the start, I realized that I was in a business where there were many opportunities to make money. Just how I was to make it was then not revealed, but I just knew that I would have that fortune I had in mind In less than ten years, I did have it, and not only was it sizable, but I was a substantial stockholder in the company and had several outside profitable interests. During those years I had constantly before me a mental picture of wealth. Many people in moments of abstraction or while talking on the telephone engage in doodling – drawing or sketching odd designs and patterns upon paper. My doodling was in the form of dollar signs like these – – – – – on every paper that came across my desk. The cardboard covers of all the files placed before me daily were scrawled with these markings, as were the covers of telephone directories, scratch-pads, and even the face of important correspondence. I want my readers to remember this detail, because it suggests the mechanics to be used in applying this magic which I’ll explain in detail later. During the past years, I have found that by far the greatest problems bothering most people are financial ones. With today’s intense competition, millions are facing the same kinds of problems. However, it matters little to what ends this science is used. It will be effective in achieving the object of your desire – and in this connection, let me tell another experience. Shortly after the idea of T.N.T. – It Rocks the Earth came to me but before I put it on paper, I took a trip to the Orient and sailed on the Empress of Japan, noted for its excellent cuisine. In my travels through Canada and in Europe I had developed a fondness for Trappist cheese made by the Trappist monks of Quebec. When I couldn’t find it on the ship’s menu, I laughingly complained to the chief steward that I had sailed on his ship only to get some of the famous “Trappist” cheese. He replied that he was sorry, but there was none aboard. The more I thought about it, the more I hungered for some of that cheese. One night a ship’s party was held. Upon returning to my cabin quarters after midnight, I found a big table had been set up in one of the rooms. On it was the largest cheese I had ever seen. It was “Trappist” cheese. Later I asked the chief steward where he found it. “I was certain we had none aboard when you first mentioned it,” he answered, “but you seemed so set on having some, I made up my mind to search through all the ship’s stores. We found it in the emergency storeroom in the bottom of the hold.” Something was working for me on that trip, too, for I had no claim to anything but ordinary service. However, I sat at the executive officer’s table and was frequently his personal guest in his quarters, as well as on inspection trips through the ship. Naturally the treatment I received made a great impression on me, and in Honolulu, I often thought how nice it would be to receive comparable attention on my journey home on another ship. One afternoon I got the sudden impulse to leave for the mainland. It was about closing time when I appeared at the ticket agency to ask what reservations I could get. A ship was leaving the next day at noon, and I purchased the only remaining cabin ticket. The next day, just a few minutes before noon, as I started up the gangplank, I said to myself in an offhand manner, “They treated you as a king on the Empress of Japan. The least you can do here is to sit at the captain’s table. Sure, you’ll sit at the captain’s table.” The ship got under way. As we steamed out of the harbor, the dining- room steward asked passengers to appear in the dining room for assignment to tables. When I came before him, about half the assignments had been made. He asked for my ticket, glanced at it and then at me, saying, “Oh yes, table A, seat No. 5.” It was the captain’s table, and I was seated directly across from him. Aboard that ship, many things happened which pertain to the subject of this book, the most prominent being a party supposed to be in honor of my birthday – just an idea of the captain’s, because my birthday was actually months away. Later, when I found myself lecturing, I thought it would be wise to get a letter from the captain substantiating the story and I wrote him. He replied, “Sometimes as we go through life, instinctively we get the idea to do this or that. That noon I was sitting in the doorway of my cabin watching the passengers come up the gangplank, and as you came aboard, something told me to seat you at my table. Beyond that I cannot explain, any more than I can explain how I can frequently stop my ship at the right spot at the pier at the first try.” People who have heard the story – and who know nothing about the magic of believing – have declared that it was mere coincidence that the captain selected me. I am positive it wasn’t, and I’m also certain that this captain (who knows quite a bit about this science) will agree with me. Aboard that ship were dozens of people far more important than I could ever be. I carried nothing to set me apart, being one of those who can pass in a crowd. So obviously it wasn’t the clothes I wore or the way I looked that prompted the captain to pick me out of several hundred passengers to receive personal attention. In presenting to you this very workable science, I am aware that the subject has been handled before from many angles, but also realize that many people shy away from any approach that smacks of religion, the occult, or the metaphysical. Accordingly, I am using the language of a businessman who believes that sincere thinking, clear writing, and simple language will get any message across. You have often heard it said that you can if you believe you can. An old Latin proverb says, “Believe that you have it, and you have it.” Belief is the motivating force that enables you to achieve your goal. If you are ill and imbedded deeply within you is the thought or belief that you will recover, the odds are that you will. It’s the belief or the basic confidence within you that brings outward material results. I speak of normal and mentally healthy people. I wouldn’t tell a handicapped person that he could excel in baseball or football. Nor would I tell a woman who was quite plain- looking that she could make herself into a great beauty overnight, since the odds are against it. Yet these things could happen, for there have been many remarkable cures. And when more is learned about the powers of the mind, I firmly believe that we shall witness many cures that today’s medical profession deems impossible. Finally, I would never discourage anyone; for in this life, anything can happen – and what can help bring it to pass is Hope. Dr. Alexander Cannon was a distinguished British scientist and physician whose books on the general subject of thought stirred up controversy here and abroad. He declared that while today a man cannot grow a new leg (as a crab can grow a new claw), he could if the mind of man hadn’t rejected the possibility. The eminent scientist claimed that if the thought is changed in the innermost depths of the unconscious mind, then man will grow a new leg as easily as the crab grows a new claw. I know, such a statement may sound incredible, but how do we know that it will not be done some day? Frequently I lunch with a group of medical men, all specialists in various branches of medicine and surgery. I know that if I voiced such an idea, they would suggest that I have my head examined. However, I find that some of these doctors, especially those more recently graduated from our better schools, are no longer closing their minds to the role that thought plays in causing and curing functional disturbances in the body. A few weeks before I wrote this chapter, a neighbor came to me to explain how his warts happened to disappear. During a stay at the hospital, he had wandered out on the porch where another convalescent patient was conversing with a friend. Said the visitor to the other patient, “So you would like to get rid of the warts on your hand? Well, just let me count them, and they’ll disappear.” My neighbor said he looked at the stranger for a moment, then said: “While you’re about it, will you count mine, too?” He did, and my neighbor thought no more about it until after he had gone home and he happened to look at his hands one day. “The mess of warts had entirely disappeared!” he told me. I told this story to a group of doctors one day. A well-known specialist – and personal friend – grunted, saying, “Preposterous!” Across the table, another doctor who had recently been teaching in a medical school came to my aid, declaring that there were many authenticated cases of suggestion having been used to cure warts. I was tempted to remind them that several years before, newspapers and medical journals had reported how Heim, a Swiss geologist, had removed warts by suggestion, and had also cited the procedure of Professor Block, another Swiss specialist, in his use of psychology and suggestion for the same purpose. Back in January, 1945, Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons set up the first psychoanalytic and psychosomatic clinic in this country for the purpose of studying the relationship between the unconscious mind and the body. I kept silent, feeling that I was too outnumbered for an argument. Since this conversation, considerable publicity was given to the findings of Dr. Frederick Kalz, a noted Canadian authority who flatly stated that suggestion works in many cases, even to curing warts that are infectious and caused by a virus. In a 1945 article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Dr. Kalz declared that, “In every country in the world, some magic procedures to cure warts are known . . . It may be anything from covering the wart with spider-webs to burying toad eggs on a crossroad at new moon; all these magic procedures are effective, if the patient believes in them.” In describing the treatment of patients with skin trouble, he says, “I have often prescribed the very same ointment, accompanied by some promising words, which has been tried unsuccessfully by some other medical man, and got credit for a quick cure.” He also points out that X-ray therapy is especially suggestive; it works even when the technician fails to switch on the high power! Experiments with systematic fake irradiation bear out this observation. Here in Dr. Kalz’s work we see actual examples of the magic of believing at work in the curing of warts and the treatment of skin trouble. Another time my medical friends and I were discussing telepathy.I remarked that some of our greatest students and scholars believed in it. Dr. Alexis Carrel, of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was not only a thorough believer in the phenomenon but declared that there was definite scientific proof that man could project his thought even at great distances into other minds. “Oh, he was just a senile old man,” remarked another specialist at the table, a nationally known member of the American Medical Association. I looked at him with astonishment, for Dr. Carrel won the Nobel Prize for his medical research. When he put forth his ideas in that remarkable book, Man the Unknown, published in 1935, he was regarded as one of the world’s foremost medical scientists and investigators. I have no quarrel with the medical fraternity. Quite the contrary, for its members are generally sincere, able, and open-minded men, and a number are among my closest friends. However, some medical specialists, especially those inclined to restrict their studies to their respective fields, refuse to accept anything that may upset their early teachings and dogmatic beliefs. This resistance is not confined to the medical profession: countless specialists in other lines, including business, know very little outside of their chosen fields, and their minds are closed to any idea beyond their limited imaginations. Frequently, I have offered to lend books to these various specialists – only to be told, after informing them of the contents, that they were not interested. This is the paradox: Many apparently well-educated men and women, successful in their respective fields, will, in their broad ignorance, condemn the idea of thought power and make no endeavor to learn more about it – yet every one of them has unconsciously made use of it! Again, many people will believe only what they like to believe or what fits into their own scheme of things, summarily rejecting anything to the contrary. Countless men whose ideas developed the very civilization we live in have been hooted at, slandered, even crucified by the ignoramuses of their times. I think of the words of Marie Corelli, the English novelist who became world famous in the 19th century: “The very idea that any one creature (human) should be fortunate enough to secure some particular advantage which others, through their own indolence or indifference, have missed is sufficient to excite the envy of the weak or the anger of the ignorant . . . It is impossible that an outsider should enter into a clear understanding of the mystical spiritual-nature world around him, and it follows that the teachings and tenets of that spiritual-nature world must be more or less a closed book to such a one – a book, moreover, which he seldom cares or dares to try and open. For this reason, the sages concealed much of their profound knowledge from the multitude, because they rightly recognized the limitations of narrow minds and prejudiced opinions . . . What the fool cannot learn, he laughs at, thinking that by his laughter he shows superiority instead of latent idiocy.”1 Great investigators and thinkers of the world, including many famous scientists, are in the open today, freely discussing the subject and giving the results of their experiments. Shortly before his death, Charles P. Steinmetz, famous engineer of the General Electric Company, declared, “The most important advance in the next fifty years will be in the realm of the spiritual – dealing with the spirit – thought.” Dr. Robert Gault, while professor of Psychology at Northwestern University, was credited with the statement: “We are at the threshold of our knowledge of the latent psychic powers of man.” Much has been written and said about mystical powers, unknown forces, the occult, metaphysics (beyond science), mental physics, psychology (the science of mind), black and white magic, and many kindred subjects, causing most people to believe that they are in the field of the supernatural. Perhaps they are for some. But to me, the only inexplicable thing about these powers is that belief makes them work. During the years that I have appeared before luncheon clubs, business concerns, and sales organizations, as well as talking over the radio to thousands of people about this science, I have seen results that can be termed phenomenal. As I said before, many have used it in their business to double, treble, even quadruple their incomes. My files are filled with letters from people in all walks of life, testifying what they have accomplished by using the science. As an instance, I think of Ashley C. Dixon, whose name was once known to thousands of radio listeners in the Pacific Northwest. A number of years ago, he wrote me voluntarily to say that he had studied this subject in an academic way, but had never fully believed it until he was forty-three, when he had only 65 to his name, no employment, and no jobs available. He set out to prove to himself that the science would work. I quote the following excerpts from Mr. Dixon’s letter: “Along came your book T.N.T. It put forth in workable form all that I had known before. It was like seeing Niagara Falls for the first time. One knew there was such a place; but confirmation was the actual personal contact with it. And so, T.N.T. gave me in print the facts I had known and used, but in a clear form. Here was something I could read and use day by day, holding the thoughts till they were fully demonstrated. “What has all this been worth to me in dollars and cents? That, of course, is the question of the average man. He wants to see something . . . in the profit column; something material in the way of dollars and cents. Here’s the answer. I have made a hundred thousand dollars, most of it in paid-up insurance and annuities. I have sold my business which costs me 5,000 (originally borrowed) for 30,000, and am now working on a contract to run for the next ten years which will net me 50,000 if I loaf; and more if I care to work. This is not a boast. It is a factual statement of what has actually happened in the past ten years . . . It cannot be done in a moment, or a day or a month, but it can be done.” In 1934, during the lowest point of the Depression, the head of the Better Business Bureau in a large Pacific Coast city heard of what was happening to firms and individuals who were following my teachings. He decided to investigate my work. Later he congratulated me publicly and subsequently wrote me as follows: “My statement – that the teachings have done more to stimulate business here during the past year than any other single factor or agency – is based upon statements by numerous executives who have been using the theme successfully in their businesses . . . When I first heard of the phenomenal results you were obtaining, I was inclined to question the facts. They seemed too preposterous to be true. But upon investigation, talking with heads of firms using the theme and with salesmen who have doubled and trebled their incomes, as well as hearing many of your lectures and getting into the subject for myself, the terrific and dynamic force embraced by it all becomes apparent. It isn’t going to be understood by everyone in a minute, but firms and individuals that accept what you have to give and follow through can expect some startling and extraordinary results. You have fully demonstrated that, and therefore are to be congratulated.” This man has since risen to great heights in the business world and has written me of having seen other practical demonstrations of the workings of this science. When I started this book, I decided to check with some of the individuals and firms who had written me to certify the phenomenal results they had achieved by using this science. Without exception, every one testified to the continuing progress he had made. One of the most outstanding accounts was related by Mr. Don Quayle, once well-known to the Disabled American War Veterans, who was long active in veterans’ affairs in the Northwest. In 1937, he wrote me: “It was no easy matter, at first, to completely accept your ideas. But my circumstances and physical condition forced me to keep at it continuously until understanding came . . . You see, in February, 1924, I was stricken with partial paralysis of my lower limbs. I needed crutches to even get about at all, and at best, for only short distances, and at a snail’s pace. For a bank executive who had been active in the business world this forced inactivity was not easy to get used to. It was bearable only because I received government compensation – my disability being considered due to service during the World War. However, in 1933, the Government dropped me from the compensation rolls, and I was forced to make a living. My home and other properties were about to be repossessed. It was not a pleasant picture, nor a hopeful future. “Necessity forced me to put into practice the principles you explained so well. Sticking to it proves them. Possibly I was favored because I couldn’t quit the insurance and public accounting business – due to my inability to enter any other kind of work. But persistence gives confidence, and continued right mental attitude followed by consistent action will bring success. I haven’t reached the degree of success I desire, but that does not bother me at all, for now I am making a good living, have saved my properties, and know the formula that leads to the fullest success. When you have that knowing inside you, fear vanishes, as do the obstructions to a continued life of all good.” I first met Mr. Quayle just after he had started his business with one desk in the front of a plumbing shop. In the following years, it was a pleasure to see him move from place to place, his business growing by leaps and bounds, until he occupied the entire ground floor of a building on one of the main thoroughfares of a great western city. Realizing that his story of achievement was a remarkable one, I asked permission to quote his earlier letter. “By all means, do so,” he replied, “if you think it will help others. You might add that I now have the whole quarters at 20th and Sandy and I employ twenty-two people. I have just brought the business lot between 28th and 29th on Sandy where I shall build my own office building. I sincerely wish that all people would accept your teachings.” At the time I grasped this science, I had no idea that I was later to put it into book form. My primary thought was to use it to save my own organization from bankruptcy. I was then vice-president of an investment banking firm, and we had been caught in the economic crisis and were headed for disaster. I don’t know whether I was inspired, but I dictated the first draft of my brochure in its entirety in less than five hours, without notes or references of any kind before me. At the same time the idea for the brochure came to me, the words, “cosmic consciousness,” floated before my mind. They meant nothing then. But after T.N.T – It Rocks the Earth was published, it reached a woman author living in New York, who wrote me as follows: “Seriously, I’ve been eating and sleeping [your] philosophy for the last ten years. It brought me to New York on no carfare; it sold my stuff to publishers when I had a lousy little job earning 30 a week . . . It took me to Europe a couple of times, and bought me silver foxes.” In the same letter, she urged me to read Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke’s Cosmic Consciousness, declaring that it contained brilliant accounts of the actual experience of illumination. When I did, I was astounded to discover that my experience actually paralleled the illuminations listed and explained by Dr. Bucke. In the original draft of my brochure, I had described in detail my experience with “brilliant white light.” But subsequently, when I showed the manuscript to a close friend, he urged me to tone down the wording: “People won’t know what you are talking about in referring to that ‘white light’ – some may think you’ve gone off the deep end.” Consequently, I changed it. But those of you that know something about “cosmic illumination” and have read my earlier small book will catch my reference to the “light.” However, the memory of that singular experience will always remain with me: in those few seconds, I received more knowledge and understanding than I had ever received in years of reading and studying. In the same period, it came to me in a flash why my firm was going on the rocks – not because of the threatening outside happenings and events, but because of the mental attitude of our employees. We were all succumbing to mass fear-thoughts: we feared that the Depression was weakening our spirit and sweeping everything downhill to financial disaster. With our own thoughts of ruin, we were attracting the disaster to ourselves. It occurred to me that to save the firm and to begin fighting the Depression itself, all I needed to do was reverse the thinking of every person connected with our organization. I set about doing that very thing. As Frank W. Camp, who wrote the introduction to my brochure declared, it was followed “by the most remarkable transformation of individuals and organization as well.” I admit that some of my statements may be ridiculed by classroom psychologists. But every day, thousands of people demonstrate for themselves that the science works. As for you, the reader, the main point to consider is whether it will work for you. The only way you can find out is to try it yourself. I give you this science, in the confident knowledge that no matter how you use it, you will get results. But I do wish to repeat a warning given in my brochure: Never use it for harmful or evil purposes. Since the beginning, there have been two great subtle forces in the world – good and evil. Both are terrifically powerful in their respective scopes and cycles. The basic principle operating both is mind power – massed mind power. Sometimes evil appears to have the upper hand, and at other times good is at the controls. It is mind power that has built empires, and we have seen how it can be used to destroy them – history has recorded the facts. If you read this book reflectively, you will understand how the science can be used with terribly destructive force, as well as for good and constructive results. It is like many natural forces, such as water and fire, which are among men’s greatest benefactors. Yet both can be hideously catastrophic, depending upon whether they are used for constructive or destructive purposes. Therefore, take great care that you do not misuse the science of “Mind Stuff.” I cannot emphasize this too strongly, for if you employ it for harmful or evil purposes, it will boomerang and destroy you just as it has others down through the centuries. These are not idle words, but solemn words of warning.","completion":"From the work \\"How I Came to Tap the Power of Belief\\" by Claude M. Bristol, we can glean the following insights and lessons: 1. Belief as a powerful force: Bristol is convinced that there is a force, which he refers to as belief, that enables individuals to overcome adversities and achieve remarkable success. This belief is practical and workable and has been known for centuries, although it might seem mystical or unknown to many. 2. Personal experiences substantiating belief: Bristol shares his personal experiences, including his time in the military and subsequent success in business, to show how harnessing the power of belief can lead to positive outcomes. 3. The influence of thought: Bristol argues that thought is a science with concrete effects on the material world. The way we think can have a profound impact on what we attract or repel in life. 4. The universal application of belief: Throughout the book, Bristol suggests that belief can enable any intelligent and sincere person to achieve their desires, regardless of the specific nature of those desires. 5. Skepticism and openness: He discusses the skepticism he often encounters, particularly from professionals in various fields, emphasizing the importance of an open mind to understand the potential of belief. 6. Practical application: Bristol's message is not merely theoretical; he insists that the principles he outlines can and should be applied practically to see tangible results. He cites the experiences of individuals who have doubled or tripled their incomes or achieved other forms of success by using the principles of belief. 7. The power of visualization and affirmation: He provides strategies like mental visualization of wealth and affirmations (with his example of drawing dollar signs) as practical tools to reinforce belief and manifest desired outcomes. 8. The ethics of belief: Bristol warns that while belief can be used to achieve good, it should never be misused for evil or harmful purposes because it can cause destruction, akin to the natural forces of water and fire which can be either beneficial or catastrophic. 9. The importance of perseverance: He highlights that belief requires persistence and consistent action. It is not a magic trick but a practice that can require time and dedication before its effects are fully realized. 10. Connection to broader concepts: Bristol references cosmic consciousness, conveying that his discoveries and experiences are linked to a greater understanding and that illumination can happen suddenly, providing profound knowledge and insight. Bristol's work advocates for the practical application of belief to achieve personal and professional goals and advises readers to apply these principles ethically, with a focus on constructive outcomes."},{"prompt":"more","completion":"In addition to the above insights, Claude M. Bristol's work \\"How I Came to Tap the Power of Belief\\" also offers the following lessons and considerations: 11. **Subconscious Influence**: Bristol suggests that one's subconscious mind plays a pivotal role in harnessing belief. By influencing the subconscious with affirmative thoughts, an individual can create a powerful internal system that works towards their goals. 12. **Overcoming Limiting Beliefs**: The book stresses the importance of overcoming self-imposed limitations. Bristol implies that many of these are the result of societal conditioning and that pushing beyond them through self-belief can lead to extraordinary achievements. 13. **Understanding 'Mind Stuff'**: Bristol uses the term \\"Mind Stuff\\" to describe the intangible, yet powerful mental forces at play. He encourages a fuller understanding of these forces to unlock their potential. 14. **Connection to Success**: He connects the power of belief directly to personal and business success, making a case that belief is a common denominator among successful people throughout history. 15. **The Role of Desire**: Desire is highlighted as a key motivator. Bristol suggests that true belief starts with a sincere desire or aspiration, which then fuels the belief system to work effectively. 16. **The Impact of Environment**: The book touches on how our environment, including the people around us and prevailing societal thoughts, can affect individual belief systems and, by extension, our capabilities for success. 17. **Stories as Evidence**: Bristol includes numerous anecdotes and testimonials from others who have used the power of belief to change their circumstances, providing real-life evidence to support his arguments. 18. **Critical Thinking and Acceptance**: While Bristol's ideas might conflict with certain scientific or religious views, he encourages readers to engage critically with his ideas and to decide for themselves using reason and experience rather than blind acceptance. 19. **Training Your Mind**: The implication is that one's mind can be trained or conditioned to believe in success, and that this training can significantly change one's life trajectory. 20. **Empowerment**: Ultimately, the power of belief is framed as an empowering tool that can help individuals take control of their lives, overcome obstacles, and shape their own destinies. Throughout the book, Bristol not only aims to prove that belief is a potent force but also provides actionable techniques that anyone can use. The emphasis is on cultivating a positive, success-oriented mindset and using the power of belief consciously and deliberately to create the outcomes one desires."},{"prompt":"how to implement all this","completion":"Implementing the principles from Claude M. Bristol's \\"The Magic of Believing\\" involves several stages of personal development and practical action. Below are steps to help you harness the power of belief based on the lessons from his work: 1. **Cultivate Desire**: Identify what you truly want. Your desire must be clear and strong enough to drive your efforts and focus your belief. 2. **Build Belief**: Consciously decide to believe in your ability to achieve your desire. You may start with affirmations, visualizations, or just a simple decision to trust in your own capabilities. 3. **Use Affirmations**: Create positive, present-tense statements that reflect the achievement of your goals. Repeat these affirmations regularly to embed them in your subconscious. 4. **Practice Visualization**: Picture in your mind the goal as already achieved. Imagine the feelings, sights, sounds, and experiences associated with having reached your objective. 5. **Act “As If”**: Begin behaving as if you have already achieved your goal. This aligns your actions with your beliefs and reinforces the belief in your subconscious. 6. **Educate Yourself**: Read books, attend seminars, and learn from people who have achieved what you want to accomplish. This grows your belief in the possibility and provides practical knowledge. 7. **Apply Persistent Effort**: Consistently work towards your goal. Understand that effort fortifies belief by providing it with substance and form. 8. **Stay Open to Inspiration**: Be receptive to ideas and hunches that come to you. These insights can direct you to actions or solutions you hadn't previously considered. 9. **Use Written Goals**: Write down your objectives and the steps needed to reach them. Seeing your plan in writing can strengthen your belief that it is achievable. 10. **Surround Yourself with Believers**: Spend time with others who support your aspirations. Avoid negative influences that could erode your belief. 11. **Reflect On Successes**: Keep track of every success, no matter how small. Reflection on past achievements reinforces your belief in your ability to succeed again. 12. **Handle Doubts**: When doubts arise, confront them with evidence of your past successes and the logical reasoning that supports your belief. 13. **Mind Your Speech**: Use language that reflects confidence and expectation of success. Avoid self-defeating talk or expressing doubts about your goals. 14. **Cultivate Patience**: Understand that results may not be immediate. Maintain your belief through periods of waiting or apparent stagnation. 15. **Adapt as Necessary**: Be flexible and willing to change tactics if something isn't working, but always keep your end goal in sight. 16. **Maintain Ethical Standards**: Use your belief for good, constructive purposes, and towards goals that do not harm others or yourself. 17. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly take time to reflect on your progress. Make adjustments to your belief system and actions as necessary. Implementing the power of belief is a continuous process that may require you to change how you think, speak, and act daily. Just like acquiring any new skill, it takes practice and persistence. Remember, it's not just about wishing for things to happen, but about combining belief with action to make them happen."},{"prompt":"Objetivo: Crear un certificado digital para nuestras conexiones https en el servidor de aplicaciones web.

It is a play on the word Utopia, which refers to an ideal and perfect society. In contrast, Negatopia portrays a bleak and oppressive environment where individuals may suffer from various issues such as poverty, inequality, social injustice, totalitarian rule, or extremism. In Negatopia, the government or ruling class typically maintains strict control over the citizens, often suppressing their rights and freedoms. The society is often marked by a lack of individuality, creativity, or personal expression. The economy is usually unstable and unequal, with a small elite group monopolizing resources and wealth, leaving the majority struggling to meet their basic needs. In terms of the physical environment, Negatopia may be characterized by pollution, decay, dilapidation, or scarcity of resources. The natural world may have been exploited or destroyed, with adverse consequences for the ecosystem and the well-being of its inhabitants. Furthermore, Negatopia often portrays a sense of hopelessness and despair among its residents. They may feel trapped and powerless, lacking opportunities for personal growth or improvement. The societal norms are based on fear, conformity, and surveillance, with dissent or resistance being met with severe consequences. Overall, Negatopia represents a grim and grimy vision of the future or an alternative reality, emphasizing the potential consequences of unchecked power, greed, and neglect for the well-being of the society and its individuals."},{"prompt":"Idea for antagonist version of Kurzgesagt, named Langgesagt","completion":"Title: Langgesagt - Unraveling the Dark Side of Knowledge Overview: Langgesagt, the antagonist version of Kurzgesagt, takes a unique spin on educational content, delving into subjects from a darker perspective.

В этом реферате я рассмотрю основные аспекты этого вида грабежа, такие как его понятие, признаки, последствия и возможные меры профилактики. Под видом грабежа с применением насилия, не опасного для жизни или здоровья, понимается ситуация, в которой преступник использует физическую силу или угрожает применением насилия с целью завладеть имуществом другого человека. В отличие от других видов грабежа, данный вид характеризуется отсутствием напрямую угрожающих жизни или здоровью действий. Например, это может быть удар или подталкивание, угроза применения физической силы без фактического использования ее, или пристегивание человека к какому-то предмету. Основными признаками грабежа с применением насилия, не опасного для жизни или здоровья, являются наличие физической силы или угрозы ее использования, а также целью предприятия данного действия является завладение чужим имуществом. В отличие от других криминальных преступлений, здесь основным ущербом является утрата собственности и некоторое психологическое воздействие на пострадавшего, не угрожающее его здоровью или жизни. Последствия грабежа с применением насилия, не опасного для жизни или здоровья, могут быть различными. Пострадавший может испытывать страх, тревогу, стресс из-за происшедшего инцидента. В многих случаях, даже если преступник не причинил физического вреда, психологическое воздействие может быть значительным и длительным. Одной из мер профилактики этого вида преступлений является полицейская работа и система правосудия. Эффективная превентивная деятельность, позволяющая поддерживать общественный порядок и обеспечивать безопасность, может значительно снизить количество и частоту таких преступлений. Кроме того, образование населения, осознание опасностей неправомерного обращения с имуществом других людей, может служить дополнительной профилактической мерой. Таким образом, вид грабежа с применением насилия, не опасного для жизни или здоровья, либо с угрозой применения такого насилия, является серьезным преступлением, которое требует надлежащего внимания и реагирования со стороны правоохранительных органов и общества в целом. Эффективные меры профилактики и правовая поддержка пострадавших могут способствовать снижению данного вида преступлений и созданию безопасной среды для жизни и деятельности в обществе."},{"prompt":"напиши реферат на тему вид грабежа, совершенный, в крупном размере;","completion":"Грабеж, совершенный в крупном размере, является одним из наиболее серьезных видов криминального преступления, который характеризуется завладением имуществом в значительных объемах. В данном реферате я рассмотрю основные аспекты грабежа в крупном размере, его признаки, последствия и возможные меры пресечения таких преступлений. Под грабежом, совершенным в крупном размере, понимается преступление, в ходе которого преступник незаконно завладевает имуществом другого лица в значительных объемах. Размеры завладения имуществом становятся критерием для его квалификации как грабеж особо крупным. Именно объем украденного имущества позволяет говорить о применении в данном преступлении больших масштабов и значительном ущербе для пострадавшего. Одним из основных признаков грабежа, совершенного в крупном размере, является завладение имуществом более определенного порога, установленного законодательством. Обычно этот порог заключается в определенной сумме денег, стоимости ценных предметов или объеме физического имущества. Преступники, преследующие цель совершения грабежа в крупном размере, стремятся украсть существенные ресурсы для достижения своих личных целей. Последствия грабежа, совершенного в крупном размере, могут быть очень серьезными как для экономической сферы, так и для общества в целом. Пострадавшие от таких преступлений, как правило, сталкиваются с финансовыми потерями, психологическим дискомфортом и ощущением нарушения личной безопасности. Большой объем украденного имущества может оказать значительное влияние на хозяйственную или коммерческую деятельность и привести к серьезным экономическим потерям. Меры пресечения грабежа в крупном размере включают усиление правоохранительной деятельности и совершенствование системы правосудия. Полиция и другие правоохранительные органы должны активно работать над выявлением, задержанием и привлечением к ответственности преступников, совершающих грабежи в крупном размере. Кроме того, важна эффективная судебная практика и наказание преступников в соответствии с законом. Таким образом, грабеж, совершенный в крупном размере, представляет собой серьезное преступление, сопровождающееся значительными последствиями для пострадавших и общества в целом. Профилактика таких преступлений требует комплексного подхода, включающего укрепление правоохранительных органов, совершенствование системы правосудия и повышение осведомленности общества об опасности крупномасштабных криминальных действий."},{"prompt":"团员问题查摆","completion":"\\"团员问题查摆\\"这个表达看起来是特定工作、管理或政治团体语境下使用的一个词汇。在中文里，“查摆”通常是指检查和反省某些问题或不足。在某些组织或党派，尤其是在中国共产主义青年团（简称共青团）这样的政治性组织里，成员会定期进行问题查摆，即自我批评和自我反省，来识别和解决存在的问题，以期更好地履行自己的职责和提升团队效能。 在实际操作中，“团员问题查摆”可能包含以下几个步骤： 1. 准备：团员通常会被告知要进行问题查摆，并准备相关材料或思考可能要讨论的问题。 2. 自我审视：团员要求对自己的行为、态度和工作进行自我评估，找出不足之处。 3. 共享讨论：团员们会在会议或者其他集体场合中分享自己的反省，也可能会提供对其他团员的意见和建议。 4. 汇总反馈：有时候会有领导或者专门的小组汇总所有人的问题查摆，形成整体的反馈。 5. 制定改进措施：根据问题查摆的结果，团员们需要制定具体的行动计划来改正问题，提出改进措施。 6. 跟进实施：定期检查每个团员的改进情况，确保实施效果。 这样的活动目的通常是为了促进团队成员的自我提升，增进互相之间的了解与沟通，并促进整个组织的健康发展。"},{"prompt":"团员问题查摆举例","completion":"团员问题查摆是要求共青团员自我反省和批评，以提高自身素质和团队工作效率。这个过程中的“问题”通常指个人在工作、学习、生活等方面存在的不足，或者团队合作中出现的问题。下面是一些团员问题查摆的举例： 1. 工作责任心不强：一个团员可能在查摆时指出自己在某些任务中表现出的责任心不够，有时推卸责任，工作态度消极，导致团队目标无法按时完成。 2. 团队协作能力差：团员可能认识到自己在团队合作中存在沟通不充分的问题，没有有效地表达自己的意见和倾听他人的想法，影响了团队的整体协作。 3. 缺乏创新和主动性：在查摆中，团员可能发现自己总是被动执行任务，缺少主动思考和提出创新解决方案的积极性。 4. 学习成绩滑坡：对于学生团员来说，可能会提到自己近期学习成绩下滑，没有有效地安排学习时间，或者学习方法不当。 5. 纪律观念淡薄：团员可能在查摆时提及自己对组织纪律的认识不足，如迟到、早退、缺席团队活动等行为，影响了团队的正常运作。 6. 公共道德意识不强：团员在查摆中可能会意识到自己在公共场合不遵守社会公德，比如乱扔垃圾、大声喧哗等，这些行为也影响了团队的形象。 7. 不积极参与团队活动：团员查摆时发现自己对于团队组织的各类活动不是很积极参与，导致错失了很多学习和交流的机会。 通过这样的查摆，团员能够明确自己存在的问题，并着手制定相应的改善计划，同时也有助于增进团队成员之间对问题的共识和解决问题的集体行动。"},{"prompt":"Как сделать так, чтобы программа работала? #include <vector> #include <string> struct Data { void* var; }; int main() { Data data1{}; data1.var = 12; std::vector<Data> vec{}; vec.push_back(data1); Data data2{}; data2.var = \\"Hello\\"; vec.push_back(data2); return 0; }","completion":"Проблема в данном коде заключается в попытке присвоить разные типы данных указателю \`var\` в структуре \`Data\`.

(Include all the pauses , inflexions and tone indications) ?","completion":"Interpreting Hamlet's iconic \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy (from Act 3, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's play) in the style of the Tenth Doctor (as played by David Tennant), we must first recognize that the Doctor's mannerisms and speech patterns differ from the traditionally dramatic and contemplative delivery of Hamlet. The Tenth Doctor's style is often characterized by energetic, fast-paced speaking with a light and sometimes humorous tone, punctuated with dramatic pauses and a range of emotions. Here's how David Tennant might adapt the soliloquy, infusing the Tenth Doctor's quirks into the performance. Keep in mind that exact tonal suggestions might differ from how Tennant, as a professional actor, would choose to interpret the text. --- (**CONTEMPLATIVE**) To be, or not to be, (*quirky eyebrow raise*) that is the question— (**CURIOUS**) Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune, (**INDIGNANT**) Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, (**PASSIONATE**) And by opposing end them? (*quick, abrupt pause*) To die, (*soft, musing*) to sleep— (**LIGHTER**) No more; and by a sleep, to say we end The Heart-ache, (*sudden intensity*) and the thousand Natural shocks That Flesh is heir to? (*fast-paced*) 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, (*quizzical*) to sleep, (**DELIBERATIVE**) To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub, (**DRAMATIC PAUSE**) For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, (*half-smile, mock theatrics*) Must give us pause. (**PONDERING**) There's the respect That makes Calamity of so long life: (**STERNER, VEERING TO SOMBRE**) For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time, The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely, (**MORE EMPHATIC**) The pangs of despised Love, the Law’s delay, (**IRONIC**) The insolence of Office, and the Spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, (**SHIFT TO LIGHTER, CONVERSATIONAL**) When he himself might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin? (*shrugs*) Who would Fardels bear, (**INCREASINGLY ENTHUSIASTIC**) To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, (**SUDDENLY SERIOUS**) The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn No Traveller returns, (*leans in, whispers*) Puzzles the will, (**GESTICULATING WILDLY**) And makes us rather bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of. (*brief pause, looks skyward*) Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all, (**RESIGNED**) And thus the Native hue of Resolution Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought, (**BAFFLED**) And enterprises of great pitch and moment, With this regard their Currents turn awry, (*deflated*) And lose the name of Action. --- Remember, David Tennant is an accomplished Shakespearean actor who has played both Hamlet and the Tenth Doctor. His versatility means that he could seamlessly blend the intensity and depth of Hamlet's existential crisis with the animated, sometimes whimsical energy of the Doctor. The above rendition is speculative and meant to provide a creative insight into how the Tenth Doctor's mannerisms could provide a unique take on the famous soliloquy."},{"prompt":"Another hypothetical - Jon Petwere rouses UNIT troops to action upon St Crispisn's Day!...","completion":"As the Third Doctor, Jon Pertwee had a certain gravitas and commanding presence, combined with an authoritative, poised, and occasionally whimsical delivery. If we imagine Jon Pertwee’s Third Doctor rallying UNIT troops with the spirit of Shakespeare’s St. Crispin’s Day speech (from \\"Henry V\\"), he might incorporate his characteristic flair for drama and his ability to inspire those around him. Here’s a playful attempt at what that speech might sound like: --- (**STANDING TALL, COMMANDING VOICE**) What's he that wishes so? My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin; If we are marked to die, we are enow To do our country loss; and if to live, The fewer men, the greater share of honour. (**WITH A FLAIR OF DRAMATIC GESTURES**) God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more. By Jove, I am not covetous for gold, Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost; It yearns me not if men my garments wear; Such outward things dwell not in my desires. (**ENUNCIATING EACH WORD WITH PRECISION AND PASSION**) But if it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive. (**SWEEPING HIS ARMS OUTWARD TO EMBRACE THE TROOPS**) No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England. God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour As one man more methinks would share from me For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more! (**FIXING EACH UNIT SOLDIER WITH A STERN LOOK**) Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host, That he which hath no stomach to this fight, Let him depart; his passport shall be made, And crowns for convoy put into his purse; We would not die in that man's company That fears his fellowship to die with us. (**INSPIRATION DAWNING, VOICE RESOUNDING**) This day is called the feast of Crispian. (**POINTING TO EACH SOLDIER**) He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named, And rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall live this day, and see old age, Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.' (**WITH A WINK AND A CHARMING SMILE**) Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars, And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.' Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, (**VOICE LOWERS, INTENSIFYING**) But he'll remember, with advantages, What feats he did that day. Then shall our names, (**PROUDLY**) Familiar in his mouth as household words— The Doctor, the Brigadier, Benton and Yates, Jo Grant and all the UNIT family— Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered. (**RAISES AN EYEBROW, TEASINGLY**) This story shall the good man teach his son; (**LOUDER, MORE INSPIRING**) And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered— (**PAUSES FOR EFFECT, THEN SOFTLY, INTIMATELY**) We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition; And gentlemen in England now-a-bed Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here, And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day. --- Pertwee's Third Doctor was very much the action hero of his time, often taking charge in a crisis, and his delivery in rallying UNIT could well embody the spirit of Shakespeare's words to convey courage, camaraderie, and a sense of daring adventure — all in a day's work for the Doctor and his trusted allies."},{"prompt":"are there other Doctors that could deliver 'appropriate' Shakespearean Speeches in their own unique ways?","completion":"Yes, each incarnation of the Doctor has a distinctive persona that could lend itself to delivering Shakespearean speeches in unique ways, tailoring them to their own idiosyncratic mannerisms and tones. Here are a few hypothetical examples of various Doctors and the Shakespearean speeches that might suit their personalities: 1. **The First Doctor (William Hartnell):** In the manner of Prospero from \\"The Tempest\\" (Act 4, Scene 1), the First Doctor could deliver the lines with a stately and slightly imperious manner, underlining his age and wisdom. \\"Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air...\\" 2. **The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker):** Embodying the whimsy and eccentricity of Jaques from \\"As You Like It\\" (Act 2, Scene 7) with the \\"All the world's a stage\\" monologue, the Fourth Doctor's rich voice and dramatic sense of timing would provide a compelling rendition. \\"All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances...\\" 3. **The Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston):** Like Macbeth from \\"Macbeth\\" (Act 1, Scene 7), the Ninth Doctor could deliver the lines with a gritty, brooding intensity, reflecting the darker aspects of his post-Time War trauma. \\"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly...\\" 4. **The Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith):** His quirky energy and rapid-fire speech would be well-matched with Puck's final monologue from \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" (Act 5, Scene 1), capturing the layered sense of fun and mischief. \\"If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended— That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear...\\" 5. **The Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi):** The Twelfth Doctor's more serious and introspective nature could fittingly render Hamlet's introspective and philosophical \\"What a piece of work is man\\" speech from \\"Hamlet\\" (Act 2, Scene 2) with gravitas and a touch of cynicism. \\"What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an Angel...\\" Each Doctor's interpretation would reflect the unique characteristics that the actors brought to the role – the gravitas, the charm, the humor, the eccentricity, and occasionally, the darkness that have made the character so enduring. Shakespeare's rich tapestry of emotional and intellectual landscape would provide ample space for these various incarnations to express themselves through his timeless words."},{"prompt":"6. The Thirteenth Doctor, could deliver a speech of the \\"Nurse\\" in Romeo And Julliet, or perhaps a female character from one of the comedies?","completion":"The Thirteenth Doctor, portrayed by Jodie Whittaker, brings energy, wit, and empathy to the role, which would lend itself well to a speech from a Shakespearean female character, particularly one with a touch of comedy or an affable nature. Let's imagine the Thirteenth Doctor delivering a modified version of Rosalind's epilogue from \\"As You Like It\\" (Act 5, Scene 4), where she breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience directly, much like the Doctor sometimes does. Here it is adapted for the Thirteenth Doctor's upbeat and inclusive persona: --- (**WITH A CHARMING SMILE AND OPEN ARMS**) Friends, I am by your good will that I am. If I were among any of you, I would desire more than I have. But as it is, I must be the one to seek for wishes – and for adventure! (**ENGAGING, DIRECT ADDRESS**) If I had a glass, I would show you a lovely image. But since I have none, let me entreat you to see me as I am, as plainly as honest as you wish your daughters to be. (**LIGHT-HEARTED, PLAYFUL**) If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell. (**WINKS**) So there's an adventure for you too, eh? (**SPREADING HER ARMS OUTWARD, INCITING ADVENTURE**) This umpteenth face of mine to the moon's shining, we'll take that ride across stars and time. So take my hand – (**HOLDS OUT HAND, INVITINGLY**) all you nurses and jesters, you star-crossed lovers and brave exiles of every world! Come along! (**GENTLY, WITH A WARM SMILE**) And as the tale is told, and our play finds ending, your applause be the sweet sound of friendship and kindness, echoing through the cosmos, that we, in our TARDIS, chase the next story—as together we always shall. --- This speech blends the essence of Shakespeare's Rosalind with the Thirteenth Doctor's characteristically hopeful, playful, and open appeal, inviting the audience (or companions) to share in the spirit of adventure and camaraderie that defines Doctor Who. Whittaker's Doctor, much like Rosalind, would confidently engage with the audience, blurring the line between the stage and reality, just as the Doctor blurs the lines between the possible and the impossible."},{"prompt":"I had \\"Missy\\" paired up with Cleopatra for some reason...","completion":"Pairing Missy (the female incarnation of the Master, as portrayed by Michelle Gomez) with Cleopatra is an intriguing choice. Both characters are captivating, possess a formidable intellect, and have a flair for the dramatic. Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, is often depicted as a complex, charismatic, and commanding figure in both history and literature, with powerful emotions and political savvy. Missy’s version of Cleopatra would likely be darkly comedic, laced with wit and unpredictability. Let's imagine how Missy could deliver a particularly famous moment of Cleopatra from Shakespeare's \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" (Act 5, Scene 2), where Cleopatra is anticipating her own end and the loss of her autonomy to Rome: --- (**DISTANT, WITH A SARDONIC TWIST OF HER LIPS**) Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have Immortal longings in me. Now no more The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip. (**HER EYES NARROW, CUNNINGLY**) Yare, yare, good Iras; quick!—Methinks I hear Antony call; I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act. I hear him mock The luck of Caesar... (**SWITCHES TO MOCKING FALSE ADMIRATION, TAUNTING**) Which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come! (**SUDDEN GLINT OF MISCHIEVOUS DELIGHT, POINTEDLY**) Now to that name my courage prove my title! I am fire and air; my other elements I give to baser life. (**STANDS PROUDLY, REGALLY, UNDEFEATED DESPITE THE CIRCUMSTANCES**) So, have you done? Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips. Farewell, kind Charmian. (**LAUGHS DARKLY**) Iras, long farewell. (**LEANS FORWARD, AS IF CONFIDING A SECRET, WITH A TWISTED SMILE**) Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall? If thou and nature can so gently part, The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch, Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still? (**GRANDIOSE GESTURE, AS IF TO COMMAND DEATH ITSELF, EMBRACING THE INEVITABLE WITH GLEE**) If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave-taking. --- Missy's delivery would be characterized by her unique blend of humor and menace, adding layers to Cleopatra's character that show strength even in defeat and a final act of defiance against being paraded as a trophy by Octavian. As with Missy’s character, there would be a sense of performing till the very end, turning tragedy into a final act of control, making it her choice rather than succumbing to the will of her conquerors."},{"prompt":"And a final hypothetical - Shakespeare did not write a history about \\"Stephen and Matilda\\" , but what might a speech of Matlida's have been, reflecting upon the feud with her siblings over the Crown?","completion":"Given that Shakespeare did not write a play about the historical feud between Empress Matilda and her cousin Stephen of Blois over the English crown, any creation of Matilda's speech would need to reflect the melodious language and poignant expression typical of Shakespeare's female characters in his history plays. Here is a speculative attempt to give voice to Matilda, in soliloquy, as she might have reflected on the turmoil of the English succession: --- (**MATILDA, ALONE, AN AIR OF ROYAL DIGNITY MIXED WITH A HINT OF DESPAIR**) What fickle hand of Fate hath wrought this coil, This writhing serpent's nest of rightful claim? My father's dying wish, his kingdom, sworn To me—the anvil of our nation's future— Now by ambition's blow doth bloom to war. (**GLANCING AT THE PORTRAIT OF HER FATHER, HENRY I**) Enrobed in shadows, Father sits in silence— Thou monarch dead, whose word, like stone, did set My path untraceable to all but Heaven— Yet here, where blood and birth my cause endear, Mine own kin's challenge rends that sacred bond. (**WITH SARDONIC BITE**) What king made she, whose womb a prince did bear? Must I, a woman clothed in tenor of a man, Besiege mine enemy, as oft they me, And play the throne’s contentious game for life? (**WITH GROWING INTENSITY, HANDS CLASPED NOT IN PRAYER, BUT RESOLUTION**) My brother’s majesty, usurped by Stephen’s hand, Cries out from silent tomb and hollow crown— \\"O, sister, claim the sceptre due thine arms, And wash the stain of treachery with blood!\\" (**TURNING AWAY FROM THE PORTRAIT, LOOKING OUTWARDS**) Aye, Stephen of Blois, cousin so adorned With courteous mien yet laced with venom's thread, Wouldst thou now sit where kings alone should tread, And uproot lineage with thy grasping plea? (**WITH BURNING FERVOR AND FURY**) Shall usurpation flood our English shore While I, with regal right to rule enthroned, Watch as the lily falters 'neath the weed? Nay! I’ll not yield, nor gentle go to night. For I hold firm, as oak to tempest’s roar, In tempest I am found and tempest borne. (**HER VOICE SOFTENS TO A WHISPER, A MOMENT OF VULNERABILITY REVEALED**) O, earth of England, ye have suckled kings, And fed with blood the rose and lion’s pride. Now drink ye deep of this, our fractured realm, As woman takes the field 'gainst kith and kin. (**RESOLUTE, UPLIFTED BY A SURGE OF HOPE AND DUTY**) With vision clear as stars on winter’s eve, They’ll know Matilda's right, Matilda's cause— To birth a legacy of might and just, From this entangled throne of thorns and loss. (**STEELING HERSELF FOR THE STRUGGLE AHEAD, A FINAL CRY TO THE HEAVENS**) Henceforth let every strike and stratagem Ring loud the bell of true succession’s claim. And I, enwombed with fierce paternal right, Shall rise or fall, as fortune casts her die. --- In creating such a speech, one must channel the essence of Shakespeare's work, attending to the rhythm of iambic pentameter, the use of metaphor and classical reference, and the exploration of themes such as legitimacy, power, and gender roles. Matilda, battling in a world that favored male rulers, would likely ponder deeply on her position as heir and the challenges that come with both her gender and the era’s political mercilessness. Her hypothetical speech would need to encapsulate her steely resolve and determination to fight for the crown at all costs, honoring her father's legacy and refusing to be undone by the ambitions of her cousin Stephen."},{"prompt":"¿Como curar el COVID hoy?","completion":"Hasta la fecha de corte de mis conocimientos en marzo de 2023, el manejo del COVID-19 depende de la gravedad de los síntomas y el estado de salud general del paciente. Para aquellos con enfermedad leve, el tratamiento se dirige principalmente a aliviar los síntomas y puede incluir: 1. Descanso: Permite que el cuerpo luche contra la infección. 2. Hidratación: Beber líquidos para prevenir la deshidratación. 3. Medicamentos para manejar los síntomas: Esto puede incluir antipiréticos y analgésicos como el paracetamol o el ibuprofeno para reducir la fiebre y aliviar el dolor. Para casos moderados a graves, o en personas de alto riesgo, el tratamiento puede incluir: 1. Terapias antivirales: Como el remdesivir, que es administrado bajo supervisión médica, normalmente en un entorno hospitalario. 2. Corticosteroides: Por ejemplo, la dexametasona se ha utilizado para tratar a pacientes con COVID-19 severo que requieren oxígeno o ventilación mecánica, ya que puede ayudar a reducir la inflamación en los pulmones. 3. Tratamientos con anticuerpos monoclonales: Estos son utilizados en algunos casos para ayudar al sistema inmunológico a combatir el virus, pero su disponibilidad y uso dependen de las directrices de las autoridades sanitarias locales y la evolución de la pandemia. 4. Oxigenoterapia: Para los pacientes que tienen dificultad para respirar o hipoxemia. 5. Ventilación mecánica: Para los pacientes que no pueden respirar por sí mismos debido a la insuficiencia respiratoria. Es importante mencionar que las vacunas han sido una herramienta clave en la prevención del COVID-19 y las complicaciones asociadas. Las personas vacunadas suelen experimentar síntomas más leves en comparación con aquellas que no han sido inmunizadas. Es fundamental seguir las recomendaciones y actualizaciones de los organismos de salud sobre el tratamiento y la prevención del COVID-19, ya que las guías clínicas pueden cambiar rápidamente conforme emergen nuevas evidencias y tratamientos. Además, siempre se debe buscar el consejo de profesionales de la salud para obtener información actualizada y guiada por el contexto específico de cada paciente."},{"prompt":"Si veo que estoy cogiendo síntomas poco a poco, ¿Mejor tomarme Ibuprofeno y para","completion":"Si empiezas a notar síntomas que podrían ser compatibles con COVID-19, es importante adoptar un enfoque cuidadoso y considerado: 1. **Aislamiento:** Primero, debes aislarte para evitar la posibilidad de contagiar a otros. 2. **Prueba de COVID-19:** Hazte una prueba para confirmar si tienes la infección. Puede ser una prueba rápida de antígeno o una prueba PCR más precisa, dependiendo de la disponibilidad y las recomendaciones de tu área geográfica. 3. **Consulta médica:** Si el resultado de la prueba es positivo, o si los síntomas empeoran, busca consejo médico. Un profesional de la salud te ofrecerá las mejores recomendaciones basadas en tus síntomas, historial médico y vulnerabilidades potenciales. 4. **Medicamento para síntomas leves:** Para los síntomas leves, como fiebre o dolor, medicamentos como el paracetamol (acetaminofén) o el ibuprofeno pueden ayudar a aliviar estas molestias. Es importante utilizar estos medicamentos de acuerdo con las instrucciones del fabricante o las indicaciones de un profesional de la salud. 5. **Monitorea tu salud:** Mantén un seguimiento de tus síntomas. Si se vuelven más graves o si experimentas dificultad para respirar, presión o dolor persistente en el pecho, confusión, labios o cara azulados, busca atención médica inmediata. 6. **Sigue las directrices de salud pública:** Cumple con las recomendaciones de las autoridades sanitarias locales respecto al aislamiento, cuándo retornar a las actividades normales y cómo proteger a los demás. Es importante destacar que no debes automedicarte sin antes hablar con un profesional de la salud, específicamente en el caso del COVID-19, ya que puede requerir un enfoque terapéutico más complejo y personalizado, especialmente si existen factores de riesgo para enfermedad grave. Además, la automedicación inapropiada puede llevar a efectos secundarios no deseados o interacciones medicamentosas perjudiciales."},{"prompt":"¿Ducharme con agua fría o bien caliente para curar el COVID?","completion":"Ducharse con agua fría o caliente no cura el COVID-19. El SARS-CoV-2, virus que causa el COVID-19, es un virus respiratorio que debe ser combatido por el sistema inmunológico del cuerpo y, en algunos casos, con medicamentos antivirales y tratamientos de apoyo. Cambiar la temperatura del agua durante la ducha no tiene un efecto directo sobre el virus. Sin embargo, ducharse puede ayudarte a sentirte mejor si estás enfermo, aliviando algunos síntomas: - Un baño caliente puede ser reconfortante y puede ayudar a aliviar los dolores musculares y el malestar general que a menudo vienen con la enfermedad. - El vapor del agua caliente también puede ayudar a aliviar la congestión nasal y la tos si inhalas el aire húmedo. - Por otro lado, si tienes fiebre, una ducha más fresca podría ser más cómoda y podría ayudarte a refrescarte. Es importante recordar que los tratamientos eficaces para el COVID-19 deben ser determinados por profesionales de la salud. Si tienes síntomas de COVID-19 o has dado positivo en la prueba, sigue las recomendaciones oficiales de tratamiento y aislamiento social para protegerte y proteger a los demás. En resumen, aunque la ducha a tu preferencia de temperatura puede ayudarte a sentirte más cómodo, no es un tratamiento para el COVID-19. El enfoque principal debe ser el manejo de síntomas y el seguimiento de las indicaciones médicas."},{"prompt":"¿Pero para ello es mejor baño caliente?","completion":"Mientras que un baño caliente no tiene el poder de curar el COVID-19, puede proporcionar alivio sintomático de lo que suele ser una experiencia incómoda cuando uno está enfermo. El vapor de un baño caliente puede ayudar a aliviar la congestión nasal y puede ser reconfortante si te sientes con frío o tienes dolores en el cuerpo, lo cual es común con enfermedades como el COVID-19. Además, si estás experimentando escalofríos, algo que puede suceder con la fiebre, un baño caliente puede ayudar a aumentar tu sensación de calor. No obstante, si la fiebre es alta, algunos profesionales de la salud pueden recomendar duchas o baños tibios en lugar de muy calientes para ayudar a bajar la temperatura corporal. Es importante escuchar a tu cuerpo y hacer lo que te haga sentir más cómodo, siempre con precaución para evitar quemaduras o desvanecimientos. Sin embargo, no hay evidencia científica que sugiera que la temperatura del agua de una ducha o bañera tenga un impacto en la recuperación del COVID-19. Recuerda que el mejor enfoque para tratar el COVID-19 es seguir las recomendaciones de las autoridades sanitarias y buscar la asistencia de un profesional de salud."},{"prompt":"¿Me tomo Paracetamol y Ibuprofeno juntos para curar el COVID?","completion":"El paracetamol (también conocido como acetaminofén) y el ibuprofeno son medicamentos que pueden ayudar a aliviar los síntomas de la fiebre y el dolor, y ambos se han usado en el manejo de los síntomas leves del COVID-19. Sin embargo, estos medicamentos no \\"curan\\" el COVID-19, sino que ayudan a controlar los síntomas mientras tu cuerpo lucha contra la infección. Tomar paracetamol e ibuprofeno juntos no es generalmente necesario y puede no ser recomendable, ya que ambos medicamentos tienen como función principal reducir la fiebre y aliviar el dolor. No obstante, algunos profesionales de la salud a veces recomiendan alternarlos para el manejo de la fiebre o el dolor cuando uno solo no es suficiente. Esto es algo que debe evaluarse en cada situación particular. Es importante recordar que el uso de cualquier medicamento debe seguir estas pautas generales: - **Dosis seguras y adecuadas:** No superar la cantidad máxima recomendada en 24 horas para cada medicamento. - **Intervalos de tiempo:** Respetar los intervalos de tiempo entre dosis para evitar la sobredosificación y los efectos secundarios. - **Condiciones médicas preexistentes:** Tener en cuenta las condiciones médicas que pueden contraindicar el uso de estos fármacos, como enfermedades hepáticas para el paracetamol o problemas gastrointestinales para el ibuprofeno. - **Consultar con un médico:** Es importante consultar a un profesional de la salud antes de comenzar o modificar cualquier régimen de medicación, especialmente si estás tomando otros medicamentos o tienes condiciones de salud subyacentes. Si tienes COVID-19 y estás considerando tomar medicamentos para los síntomas, siempre debes consultar con un profesional sanitario para obtener una recomendación personalizada basada en tu estado de salud individual y la gravedad de tus síntomas. El profesional médico podrá aconsejarte sobre la mejor manera de proceder con los medicamentos para el dolor y la fiebre."},{"prompt":"¿Que comprar en el Mercadona para curar el COVID?","completion":"No hay alimentos ni productos que curan el COVID-19 a la venta en Mercadona ni en ningún supermercado. El tratamiento para el COVID-19 en casos leves generalmente implica cuidado en casa, descanso y manejo de síntomas, mientras que casos más graves pueden requerir atención médica y hospitalización. Dicho esto, aquí hay algunas cosas que podrías considerar comprar en un supermercado como Mercadona para ayudar a manejar los síntomas y mantener una buena nutrición, lo cual es importante para el sistema inmunitario: 1. **Alimentos ricos en nutrientes:** Frutas y verduras frescas para obtener vitaminas y minerales esenciales. 2. **Hidratación:** Agua, caldos suaves o bebidas electrolíticas para mantenerte hidratado, especialmente si tienes fiebre o diarrea. 3. **Alimentos fáciles de digerir:** Galletas saladas, tostadas, arroz blanco y plátanos si tienes el estómago delicado. 4. **Vitaminas y suplementos:** Si bien no curan el COVID-19, algunos suplementos como la vitamina D, la vitamina C y el zinc son conocidos por apoyar la función inmunológica. Sin embargo, debes consultar con un profesional de la salud antes de comenzar cualquier suplemento nuevo. 5. **Medicamentos de venta libre para aliviar síntomas:** Paracetamol o ibuprofeno, según recomendación médica. 6. **Artículos de limpieza y desinfección:** Toallitas desinfectantes, jabones y geles de alcohol para mantener las manos y las superficies limpias y reducir el riesgo de propagación del virus. Recuerda que la compra de cualquier medicamento debe estar basada en una recomendación médica, y que el seguimiento de las directrices de las autoridades sanitarias y de salud es fundamental en la gestión de la enfermedad.

He navigated the bustling hallways like a ghost, his presence barely registering to his more illustrious peers, who basked in the drama and excitement of teenage life. On this particular day, as the final bell rang, releasing a surge of students towards their after-school escapades, Kota lingered behind, ensuring the last remnants of their chatter faded away before slipping out. He had no club activities, no social obligations; instead, he preferred the safe embrace of his favorite secluded corner of the school library, where he could lose himself in other worlds etched between the lines of ink on paper. Today was different, though. Today, the library corner wasn’t empty. Slouched in ‘his’ seat was a curious figure — a girl whose wild, azure hair cascaded around her shoulders as if she'd been romantically pulled straight from one of the manga pages he so adored. Kota stumbled, his scientific mind searching for a logical explanation. Was she a transfer student? He surely would have heard about such an electric addition to their student body. The girl lifted an amused gaze, emerald eyes glinting with what seemed to be an unspoken secret. \\"You're finally here, Kota Matsuda,\\" she announced casually, as if they were long-time acquaintances. \\"I'm sorry, do I know you?\\" Kota squeaked, self-consciously adjusting his foggy glasses. There was something ineffable about her that both intrigued and intimidated him. \\"Not yet,\\" she said, her grin revealing that her words danced on the border of mischief. “But you will. You've been chosen for quite the extraordinary adventure. You're about to change worlds, literally.\\" He snorted. \\"Right, and I'm the student council president.\\" Sarcasm provided him a flimsy shield against the rapid palpitations in his chest. This had to be some new form of bullying, a prank orchestrated by the popular crowd for cheap laughs. The girl leaned forward, her aura suffusing the stale library air with a palpable charge. “No joke, Kota. You have the potential—no, you’re destined to become a legendary hero in another world.” His laughter wavered, dissipating as the hair on his forearms rose with her every impassioned word. “You’re serious…” She stood abruptly, her hand extending a small, ornate device toward him. \\"Grab it, and you'll see I'm not lying.\\" His hand shook with hesitation, but the relentless curiosity that governed the quiet currents of his life prompted him to reach out. As his fingers brushed against the metal, a shocking pulse surged through him, and the library—no, the entire world— began to spin like a top nearing the end of its tilt. \\"What's—?” Kota tried to speak, but his words were swallowed by the wind that howled around them, the library walls stretching and twisting into impossible shapes. “Hold tight, Kota Matsuda! And remember, sometimes the most exciting stories are waiting for you to jump in and live them,” the girl shouted over the tempest. Before he could reply, the world went black. When Kota’s vision cleared, he found himself standing in the center of a grand coliseum, the girl from the library now donning a regal cloak and a mischievous smile. \\"Welcome to Entelesia, the realm where heroes are forged,\\" she exclaimed, \\"and the first challenge awaits you, Hero Kota!\\" Adrenaline coursed through him as he took in the armored opponents lining up across the field, the strange attire of the spectators filling the stands, and then, the unnerving realization hit him— He was no longer in Kansas... or rather, Minamoto High. A horn bellowed, and with that, Kota Matsuda's ordinary life came to an abrupt end as he stepped into the opening scene of his very own isekai tale, complete with the promise of ecchi encounters, high school drama, romantic comedy, and action-packed challenges. The girl winked. \\"Ready or not, your story starts now!\\" And as a fierce opponent charged at him, weapon drawn, the cliffhanger was painfully literal.

Your task is to analyze the following excerpt of text and create a professional analysis of it literary style and describe it in bullet points. In the end, suggest 2-3 modern known authors with similar style. The text: Recent events immediately took the proportion of a full-scale scandal after Aemma’s initial plan got out of control, for better, rather than for worse. She had not spoken with Viserys privately ever since — he needed some time to recover from shame, shock and humiliation he brought on himself thanks to his own naivety. More feasts and banquets followed and every time Lady Alicent was announced to the Great Hall or the Godswood, her entrance was accompanied with stifled laughs and whispers of those who witnessed her faux pas, while those who only heard the gossip, cast curious glances, filled with either disdain or mockery. So was the life at the court — the gossip spread like a wildfire with intensity even Aemma was not prepared for. Perhaps, Viserys was right that for many mattered only perception, not the truth, and she was ready to accept it as long as it served her needs. The victory would have been sweeter still, if the dirt did not taint her family’s honour. Alas, they let the Hightowers crawl too close to them, getting under their bedsheets, breaching the privacy of the Targaryens. The scene everyone witnessed was terribly humiliating, for Aemma most of all, but, bracing herself, she decided that she was ready to give this sacrifice, for the outcome greatly outweighed the inconvenience — now it was a perfect opportunity to demand things from Viserys which he would never grant in any other circumstances. Ladies-in-waiting whispered in hushed tones about what happened when they thought the Queen was out of earshot, but she knew well, how they savoured all the details of the scene. No one dared to accuse the King directly, Aemma’s reputation was also intact, but what they were telling about Alicent and Otto was spiced with such vivid descriptions, that only idle minds could think of. They were telling that it was not Alicent’s first time when she was seen with a married man, there were many of them, actually; that Otto had lost any limits and with his desire to gain control he uses his own daughter as a pawn, and he was no better than a pimp in a brothel. People’s tongues were as sharp as Valyrian steel and desire to dance on Otto’s bones burning. When Aemma left her solar and stepped into the antechamber, she caught snippets of conversation about Alicent — she almost became a byword for her lack of womanly virtue. Young ladies were hemming the shirts which were supposed to be later distributed among the poor citizens of Kings Landing, while it was decided to send some of them in wagons of visiting lords and give to the people of farther parts of the Kingdoms in the name of Princess Rhaenyra and Her Grace the Queen. Aemma shushed the girls, chastising them for sloppy stitches. “You work with your tongues better then with you fingers.” she scolded them. “It ought to be vice versa. Do not shame me or my daughter with poor and shoddy work.” Ladies ducked their heads shamefully and muttered apologies, while Aemma joined them in their sewing, but first passed a pair of scissors to undo the clumsy seams and ordered to do them again. It was more difficult with Rhaenyra, though. The girl considered Alicent to be her friend and she was most bewildered when the first wave of gossips reached her ears. Aemma walked her through the events of that day as carefully as she could, omitting some of the details, save those having real importance. Rhaenyra approached Aemma quietly, sitting next to her on a settee. In a light blue silken dress she looked vulnerable again, not a proud Targaryen princess she was several days ago, when all the Lords pledged her fealty and oath of allegiance. “Is it true, mama? What the courtiers are gossiping about?” she asked hesitantly, afraid to hear the answer. “Well, my dear, more often than not people tend to surprise us in a negative way, and, alas, we can do little about it, if only be prepared for the blow and not let the circumstances overwhelm us.” Aemma explained, gently stroking Rhaenyra’s hair. “Alicent got entangled in her father’s nasty plotting and, although, she followed his orders, it was her choice to walk the path which brought her nothing but humiliation.” this explanation was sufficient for Rhaenyra who sighed and nodded in understanding. Still, the question lingered in the air. “And you, mother? And father…” “Ha”, chuckled Aemma, doing her best to sound unperturbed and nonchalant, “it does not take so little to sweep me off my feet. While your father truly needs to learn how to discern who is his friend and who is foe.” assured Aemma, but her daughter’s face was still hard to decipher. It could not be any different, for it was not only her parents, but a friend involved. “Do not be sad, my love, you will find new friends and companions. Laena Velaryon for one. She is a nice girl and knowing her mother, she should have decent upbringing.” she emphasised the word decent. Of that she would take care of herself, Rhaenyra should be surrounded with pure, honest and virtuous young ladies, not like… Like Alicent, who was quick to undress herself at first call. Nyra gave her a questioning look and Aemma elaborated, “You are coming of age, Rhaenyra. And as the princess and heir you need your own household. We will select ladies-in-waiting for you together, the nicest girls from leal Houses, trustworthy and refined. They will be the part of your own court when you are queen.” smiled Aemma, wrapping her arm over Nyra’s shoulders. “Agreed?” “Agreed.” echoed Rhaenyra in a soft whisper, traces of sadness leaving her voice. *** “Prince Daemon Targaryen is here to see you, my queen.” announced the Kingsguard in a formal manner. Aemma allowed his entrance, dismissing her ladies. Conversation with Daemon was welcomed, since Aemma wanted to discuss her plans with him first and only then go to his older brother. “Aemma, is it true?” said Daemon instead of greeting. In several long steps he reached the table with refreshments, filled a cup of wine and drained it in several gulps. Then looked back at Aemma with glee. “The thing the whole court is now gossiping about. You really did this? You ruined Otto’s reputation as well as that of his little whore!” His eyes were two large amethysts, mischief and triumph sparkling in them. Aemma chuckled, but there was more bitterness in it than humour. “Everything happened just as I expected. I believe, there is no need to give you the details, you must have already heard them from the courtiers.” Daemon snorted, his disdain apparent. “No good would ever have come from a girl from the Hightower. They are all too ambitious, always forgetting their place and that it is the Targaryens who conquered them and burnt their kings. I am not even surprised that the little whore threw herself at my foolish brother without giving it a second thought.” “Well, she will not be able to do such a thing again.” Aemma mused. “There is enough scandal to satisfy those eager to gossip for months to come.” smirked Daemon savagely. “What are you going to do with her? She cannot stay at court, for sure. She should be given to the Faith, that is what I think. A novice to septas or silent sisters will do her good.” he clapped his hands excitedly, plucked a grape and threw it into his mouth. Aemma looked up at him, considering his words. Perhaps, he was right, making a Sept of this girl would do her good, but she could not force herself to take such drastic action, it was a set-up, after all, and it was partially Aemma’s fault. This nagging thought did not let her go, although in the back of her mind she knew that Alicent would do the same when the situation allowed, even without Aemma’s trap. “I will try to find her a match.” Daemon snorted, rolling his eyes. “Gods, you are too generous, cousin.” he clicked his tongue in disappointment. “Yes, I do not mean to ruin the girl’s life. She did one man’s bidding to please another man and got nothing for herself but shame. Yet, my condition is that her future husband should be from the North.” “The North?!” Daemon barked out a short laugh. “It is so bloody cold there, especially for such a delicate flower brought up under the sun of the Reach and the Crownlands.” “Well,” Aemma shrugged, “Her father will have to add some more woollen dresses and warm fur coats to her dowry.” The suggestion was met with savage grin playing on Daemon’s lips. “But her new home should be far, far away from the capital, as well as Otto’s. He, by the way, will also have to leave.” Upon hearing this, Daemon’s eyes widened in surprise and glee, but before he could say something, Aemma proclaimed, “But all of these is not as important as my main demand. I am going to ask for the annulment of your marriage.” With that Daemon’s amused face froze and he stared at Aemma in disbelief. “You could have asked anything from the king and it is my own interests you chose to advocate?” he asked slowly, mixed emotions flashing across his face. It was still strange for Aemma how vulnerable and underloved Daemon felt, even though she tried her best to prove him the opposite. He sat quietly, staring at his clasped hands. “Yours and Rhaenyra’s, yes. My offer to court Nyra was not empty words and false promises. I did not know how to accomplish it back then, but Gods have their own ways, and sometimes they cross with ours.” she reached taking his hands in hers, unclasping his fingers and squeezing them. “You see? I know there will be a lot of troubles and hindrances along the path, but I wish to secure the future for our family by all possible means available — the Targaryens will be much better off with the Hightowers far away from the throne and positions of power, and my only daughter married to a man with the same dragon blood running through his veins.” If Daemon was more eloquent and open with his feelings, he would be able to say something, cry, shout — anything to express his sheer happiness. He was not like that, though, and all he was able to do at the moment was to pull Aemma in his embrace and place a gentle kiss on her forehead, showing his infinite gratitude to his beloved cousin. It warmed her heart to know Daemon would finally get something he so much wanted, long years of disregard put to an end. Before long the prince pulled away, doubt clouding his face. “And what about Viserys? He will never agree…” “He will.” Aemma cut him off abruptly. “Viserys is here for the time being.” she said, pointing her finger at the middle of her palm and then clenching it in a fist sharply. “Right here.” she said decisively and gave a meaningful look at her balled hand. *** Aemma sent one of her handmaids to inform the King that she requested an audience. The answer came instantly, before she could even change her dress from another banquet she attended. It seemed, Viserys had been waiting for her arrival impatiently, and as soon as she was announced and walked in the vast antechamber, he crossed the distance between them, snatched up her hand, turned it over and pressed a kiss into the palm. Aemma felt the urge to recoil at the gesture, but the tickling feeling of his stubble was so familiar to her, stirring emotions and warmth. It was not the right time for such sentiments, she forced herself to think. “It is quite hot, isn’t it?” the King suddenly asked, leading her to his solar. He wiped his brow from moisture and continued, “Like the year we married, back in 93 A.C. The sun was scorching, making the thinnest and most delicate silks sticky with sweat. I found enjoyment in that, to tell the truth, you were wearing an open gown which clang to you body so appealingly that I was forced to tear my eyes off you, lest it would have looked unseemly.” he chuckled, waiting for her to join him in his sweet reminisces. She did not. Seeing that she was unwilling to share his enthusiasm, Viserys gestured at a small table and two armchairs. Approaching it, he poured two cups of wine and took a plate with berry tarts, offering them to Aemma. She shook her head, declining both — it was a serious conversation they were about to have, not a nice chat over sweat treats. Viserys sighed before pushing away the plate and cups and lowered himself heavily on a chair. “Before we begin just let me tell you, there was nothing of the sort, even if…” he swallowed hard, blushing. “Even if it looked like that. Despite this… bloody perception.” he muttered defeatedly. “You will not go from lord to lord telling the same thing, neither would you make a public announcement.” the king shook his head with serious face confirming her words, which were actually more of a sarcasm. “The best thing for all of us is to let the gossip settle down and be gradually forgotten. Do you agree with me on that?” His silver head drooped and nodded. “It was not supposed to be that way, we were only talking. And then… Then… I fail to understand why Alicent did that.” Viserys mumbled. “Oh is it so, you fail to understand?” Aemma chuckled bitterly in response. “I will tell you then — because her father, your dear Otto, sent her and told to do that.” His eyes shot up and stared at her in disbelief. “Did he suggest you taking a second wife? Or, perhaps, divorcing from a barren queen?” Aemma stroke another blow with this sudden question. Viserys wanted to deny the accusation instantaneously, but faltered, searching his memory. By the little sparkle of guilt which glistened in his eyes, Aemma understood that he did. No, Otto was not only a leech, he was a cunning poisonous spider! He had been weaving his cobweb behind everyone’s back all this time, but would he be able to resist the heat of the dragon flame, if he had chosen to play with the dragons? “Of course, he did.” Aemma said witheringly after a pregnant pause. The King sighed. “I will not lie, there was a talk about that. But I declined the notion and forbade Otto to ever mention it again.” “Oh yes, and instead of mentioning it, he jumped to actions. That is so in-character to our esteemed Lord Hand.” “I swear by the Gods, there was nothing between me and Lady Alicent. I will be honest with you, Aemma, I liked how kind she was to me, praising me and imagining me to possess the necessary skills to joust and fight, drinking in whatever I was telling her. She did not question my every decision, like—” he faltered, but Aemma knew what he wanted to say. Like she did, or Daemon. She wanted to rage at her delusional husband. How could a man in the most powerful position in the Realm fall victim to honeyed words and fulsome flattery! “The girl was sent to you on purpose, Viserys. And you fell into the trap, she made a fool of you. The King was made a laughingstock for nobles who arrived to attend his daughter’s initiation. And that is not all. With your actions you are hurting me, you are hurting Rhaenyra. You are hurting Daemon, by trusting Otto’s words above his.” Aemma threw one accusation after another, crushing her husband with the weight of the consequences of his naivety. “And Otto… What Otto does only serves the advancement of his own family.” The King’s face fell even more when he digested Aemma’s words. “So, it was false — all of it — right? That is what you want to tell me? This kindness and interest Lady Alicent showed were all artificial? To make me like her?” he asked painfully. Oh, despite the world of difference between the two Targaryen brothers, there was one thing they had in common — both of them for unknown reason felt underloved and neglected, craving for more appreciation from others. “I am relieved to see that you have understood the false nature of her advances sooner, than later.” Aemma remarked rather bluntly. Viserys absentmindedly reached for a blueberry tart and plopped it into his mouth, then another, deep in thought, his shoulders slumped in disappointment. Aemma waited patiently for him to finish the third one, then asked, “Now, are you ready to listen to me?” Viserys swallowed and gave a small nod. A satisfied smile touched Aemma’s lips. At least he repented, their conversation would go better then she anticipated. He looked up at Aemma, his face a picture of misery. She steeled herself against feeling pity for him, looking through his deep lilac eyes and plump soft cheeks, covered with silvery-gold stubble. What a weak and silly woman she was, unable to stifle a feeling towards a man who did not deserve it. “You cannot undo what was done in front of so many witnesses, Viserys. But we can prove that perception was wrong and that we are united, as king and queen, as House Targaryen. Do you want it?” she asked and her husband gave a small nod. Before Aemma could start, Viserys chuckled, saying, “I think I know what you are about to say — Otto Hightower is the culprit of everything in our life.” He looked amused with his words, but Aemma simply nodded. “He is, in fact. I am glad you can finally see this.” Viserys scowled and shook his head in exasperation. “You will not deny that he has served loyally on both mine and Grandsire’s Council for many years!” For one illuminating moment she thought that Viserys was not lying. He wholeheartedly trusted Otto and believed that it was only the good of the Realm his Hand had in mind. Aemma was not a hypocrite to deny her own guilt — she had spent years trying to produce an heir, letting Viserys fall into Otto Hightower’s trap as he coiled around the King like a snake, gradually tightening muscles and strangling its victim. Sadly, it was neither Daemon whom he chose as his councillor, nor Rhaenys. “Dear Gods, how come that you got under such strong influence of Otto Hightower, that even now, when he became the source of your shame, you are still protecting him. Where does all this protectiveness go when a matter concerns your brother? Or me? Or Rhaenyra?” Aemma exclaimed in exasperation. He opened his mouth to retort, but no words left his lips, he gawked at her, speechless, then lowered his head. “You are too prejudiced against Otto. And myself.” he muttered softly. “But I love you, even if you say otherwise. And will do whatever you ask of me.” “Oh, yes, you will.” she said, earning a rueful smile from him. “And I will try to forget your infidelity.” Relief flickered across his face, but died as quickly as it appeared. “What would you like to have in return?” “Me?” she snorted, her hand reaching to her chest. “Not really me, but those who are important to me.” Viserys cocked his head, staring at her curiously. Well, it was the time to start — hopefully, her endeavours were not for nothing. “In view of recent events, you do understand that Lady Alicent cannot stay at court. She has to leave, the sooner she does it, the quicker people will stop talking about what happened in your chambers.” “To the Oldtown?” “No, somewhere farther from the capital and from the influence of her father.” Aemma still hoped that Alicent was not that bad and ruining her life was not in her plans. Some country oaf, far from politicking and sewing treacherous seeds in her head would be fine. They would go for walks together, hunt, raise their children — this life would not be any worse than the one Otto might push her to with his insatiable greed. “And what this place would be?” he asked, but when the realization stroke him, colour rushed into Viserys’ face. “Surely, you are not planning to send this young lady to the Septa’s! You cannot be that harsh.” Aemma pondered for a moment about his words. She had not considered it seriously, but mayhap this idea was sound. Yet, she thought it best to follow her initial plan. “No, nothing like that. I understand that the girl is just a pawn in her father’s grasping hands, and she deserves to live a full life, allbeit away from the court. I will arrange a fine match for Lady Alicent. Lord Rickon Stark is residing presently in the Red Keep, he will advise me on the matter and recommend some fine young lads among his bannermen.” Viserys chewed his lip, thinking over Aemma’s proposal. “Gods be good, you want to send her to the North? This place is not for gentle ladies brought up under the sun of the Reach and then that of Kings Landing. Staying there will be for her not easier than with the septas.” “There is a difference, still.” Aemma remarked. “She will be given a chance to find love and be loved. If she is humble enough to embrace her fate, that is. The girl is unspoilt, her maidenhood will be preserved for her future husband, and courtly gossips might not reach as far as the North. People there are occupied with more down-to-earth matters, I presume.” “I give you my permission.” he declared. “Choose whomever you see fit, I trust your judgment. What is next?” “As one marriage alliance is to be made, the other is to be dissolved.” the Queen continued. She did not manage to elaborate, though, as she got interrupted by a knock on the door. Ser Harrold emerged in the doorway, bowing his head. “Lord Hand requests an audience, Your Grace. He insists on the urgency of the matter.” informed Ser Harrold. Aemma knew very well what this urgency was about. Perhaps, she somehow should have taken care of the actual letter delivered to Alicent, with Diane’s help or some other. If she kept it, and she surely did, it was a compromising evidence. Not that it would do much to clean her tarnished reputation, the damage had been done already, but it would cause certain troubles to Aemma — they would certainly try to find the person who had written it. Before Viserys could open his mouth, Aemma spoke, “Tell the Lord Hand that His Grace is presently busy and does not take any visitors.” said Aemma and Ser Harrold nodded his head politely but then looked hesitantly to the king. “Ah… Yes, I am not to be disturbed.” confirmed the king obediently. Ser Harrold bowed his head and disappeared behind the doors, only to reemerge seconds later. “The Hand informs Your Grace that he has something of utmost importance to show you. Some kind of document or letter.” Aemma froze, waiting for Viserys’ reaction. She did not expect Otto to come so quickly with the evidence against her. There was a spark of curiosity on the king’s otherwise defeated face. “Do you really deem it appropriate for the king to repeat himself twice?” Aemma took the initiative again. “No, Your Grace, absolutely not.” Ser Harrold nodded and rushed to shoo away the intrusive councillor. Aemma let out a soft sigh of relief as an idea formed in her head. Daemon knew the secret passages better than anyone — she would ask him to steal the letter from Otto’s chamber. It would not be the most dignified task for a prince, but for their mutual benefit he would agree. “You were talking about marriages, my dear.” prompted Viserys with a small smile, interrupting Aemma’s thoughts. “Yes, marriages, and actually the necessity to dissolve one.” Understanding flashed in Viserys’ face and whatever pleasantness stayed there, slipped away replaced by scowl. “Daemon, right? My brother does not value his honourable wife, Lady of the Runestone, his children could be well-off, inherit the castle and land! And instead of cherishing what he was given by the Good Queen he keeps moaning and insulting Lady Rhea.” “Thus speaks the man who was about to ruin his own marriage.” replied Aemma without a flicker of amusement. Viserys gave a hard little laugh. “You are comparing me with him?” He jabbed his finger in his chest resentfully. “He calls his lady wife a Bronze Bitch, humiliates her, disregards, while I have been only ever so kind and gentle to you.” The King reached for her hand, but she pulled it away. “Enough of this, Viserys. I am not in the mood right now. We have been through it many a time, but this one will be the last. Here is my second condition — put an end to this ugly farce and grant Daemon annulment of his marriage with Rhea Royce.” Pushed to the corner, Viserys pouted, breathed loudly, but surrendered. “Fine. As you wish. But I will speak to Lady Rhea first, as the king I must know her opinion on this matter.” “She will be delighted, believe me.” assured him Aemma. Their conversation had been going well so far and a bold idea sprang to her head. She took a deep breath, collecting herself and uttered, “Daemon will be free from his marriage and with that I want him to court Rhaenyra and if everything goes well and the feelings are mutual, ask for her hand.” Yet, what followed was quite expected… “Daemon?” cried out the King, lurching up from his chair. He narrowed his eyes and pointed an accusing finger at Aemma. “Aha! Now I can see…!! This is the reason why your first condition was to give him an annulment, is it not?!” the king burst out resentfully. Aemma bit her lip. For a chilling moment she wondered if she went too far and it was too much for Viserys, he needed time to accept all those things she demanded, and offering Daemon as a potential groom was beyond her husband’s grasp. He would come to terms with this idea. Later. “No, it is not.” she argued in a calm voice. “I wanted the annulment because it was a fruitless marriage bringing misery upon your own brother and the lady of House Royce, none of whom deserved it and it was only you who turned a blind eye to the problem.” she paused to see Viserys’ reaction — he was frowning, still thinking that it was him who was mistreated. “Maybe you will warm to the idea of Daemon as Rhaenyra’s husband, but for now I will not insist.” Viserys deflated and leaned back in his armchair, visibly relieved that he would not have to fight over this, yet his eyes remained suspicious. As he always did — terribly afraid of problems at hand — he did not speak a word about the possibility of marriage between his brother and daughter and looked at her expectantly, waiting for further demands. Now it was time to weed the garden and pluck out the poisonous plants with the root. “I hope now you can see how detrimental is Otto’s influence and meddling in our family’s affairs. Consequently, he cannot stay in his current position. You have to dismiss him and name a new Hand of the King. Not a self-serving ambitious leech, but a person who puts the interests of the Realm first.” Viserys was already too tired from their conversation to object, instead, he closed his eyes and muttered, “Of course. It could not be any different.” A heavy sigh escaped his lips as he rubbed his face with his hands. “This decision will not be announced before the festivities end, we shall wait for the lords to go back to their lands. I do not wish to make Otto’s removal a public affair. This is my condition.” He waited for Aemma to nod and she did, the timing was not that important — the fact of dismissal was. “Whom should I appoint a new Hand then?” asked Viserys, although the question was addressed more to himself than to Aemma. “You are the King and it is your choice to make.” she replied. Upon hearing it, Viserys grimaced, reluctant to make such a serious decision on his own, always so dependent on the opinion of the others. There were several worthy candidates at present, yet, each had certain nuances. Rhaenys would make a fine Hand, a wise and sharp-tongued Princess, not intimidated by men, high or low. It would help to mend the rift between the two branches of their family, but at the same time she was still resentful and could decline the offer. Daemon had always dreamt of the golden pin of the Hand, but his impetuous nature might cloud his judgment, moreover, he was needed to court Rhaenyra and not to be snowed under with papers, figures and counting of coppers. The easiest choice was someone who already was on the council, like Lord Beesbury or Lord Strong, both intelligent, experienced and loyal statesmen. Aemma watched how Viserys’ face stiffened as his mind raced in search of an answer. She reached for his hand and patted it in a placating manner. “There is no need to be in a rush. Take your time to think. We can discuss it later, if you wish.” It was actually what she hoped for, anyway without Otto’s influence the future seemed much brighter. “Let us go over it once again, Viserys. Daemon gets the annulment, Alicent Hightower is to be married and sent to the North and Otto is dismissed from his position of the Hand and leaves the capital. By the end of the festivities.” she said, showing that she was ready to accept Viserys’ condition. It took a moment for him to sigh heavily and drop his head in a nod. “Will it help me to win your favour again?” came a hesitant question in soft whisper. Viserys knotted his fingers together and humbly rested his hands on his laps, while his eyes were searching Aemma for an answer. “We shall see.” she replied, letting a tiny note of hope slip into her voice.","completion":"Analyzing the literary style of the provided text: - Flowery and archaic diction: The vocabulary used throughout the text is ornate and reminiscent of historical novels, particularly those set in a pseudo-medieval time or mirroring the style of George R.R.

These tensions demonstrate a mixture of emotional depth and plot-driven storytelling. - Detailed description of setting and etiquette: The text is dense with descriptions of places like the Great Hall and the Godswood, as well as the social decorum of a royal court, underlining the author's attention to world-building. - Use of third-person limited perspective: The narrator is closely aligned with Aemma’s point of view, which allows insight into her thoughts and plans while keeping other characters' motivations more opaque. - Element of intrigue and strategic manipulation: Character interactions are layered with deceit, strategy, and power plays, indicating a plot reliant on intrigue over action. - Use of dramatic irony and tension: The reader is made aware of Aemma's inner thoughts and schemes, which creates tension as other characters remain in the dark about her true intentions. - Sophisticated interweaving of plot threads: Multiple narratives—ranging from personal relationships to larger political changes—are skillfully woven together within the excerpt. - Emphasis on themes such as honor, reputation, and the power of perception: These ideas are central to the narrative, influencing characters' decisions and the direction of the plot. Modern known authors with a similar style: - George R.R. Martin: His series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is perhaps the closest in terms of building sophisticated political intrigue, courtly drama, and richly detailed fantasy worlds. His writing includes complex characters and multi-threaded plots. - Robin Hobb: Known for her \\"Realm of the Elderlings\\" series, Hobb writes in a style that focuses on character development and intricate political machinations in a high fantasy setting. - Brandon Sanderson: While his writing is slightly more straightforward, Sanderson's \\"Stormlight Archive\\" and \\"Mistborn\\" series offer deep world-building, political intrigue, and complex character relationships. His storytelling sometimes also features planned outlays of long-term schemes and secrets."},{"prompt":"[told from the perspective of experienced Theurgist Emerald Spritethief, there would be dialogue in this story:] (I was a 2nd-year student in the School of Life.

Today, me and my classmates actually got the day off - which was finally nice for once.)","completion":"As I stepped out of the grand, ivy-covered halls of the School of Life, the morning light danced playfully on the lush, enchanted gardens that surrounded the campus. For a Theurgist like me, this was more than just scenery; it was a vibrant source of energy, a place I drew upon for strength and inspiration. The name Emerald Spritethief might have seemed whimsical to an outsider, but it bore a history of powerful Life magic wielders who had protected the Spiral for generations. Taking a deep breath of the fresh air, I reveled in the rare respite from our intense studies. We learned to heal, to breathe life into the world around us, and, when necessary, to defend the Spiral from the various forces that sought to unravel it. \\"Emmy, wait up!\\" a voice laced with joviality called from behind. I turned to see my brother, Carson, striding towards me with his characteristic laid-back grin. His knack for finding me on crowded campus grounds never ceased to amuse me. \\"Morning, Carson. Don't tell me you're up this early by choice,\\" I teased, knowing full well how he enjoyed sleeping in whenever possible. Carson caught up, slinging an arm around my shoulders. \\"Can't let you have all the fun, can I? Besides, today's a gift, a pause from all that healing and— what'd you call it?— 'harmonizing with the energy of life' thing you do.\\" I chuckled at his casual portrayal of our craft. \\"It's a bit more complicated than that, but yes, a day off is a day off.\\" We walked through the gardens, our steps light but sure, as befitted those who trod the path of Life. Around us, the plants seemed to lean toward the sun, absorbing its energy with a visible thirst. \\"You planning on doing anything special with your day off?\\" Carson inquired, plucking a leaf and twiddling it between his fingers. \\"I was thinking of visiting the Willow Wood,\\" I replied thoughtfully. \\"There's a rare herb blooming today, and I'd like to study it in its natural habitat. What about you?\\" He smirked and tossed the leaf into the air, watching it spiral down. \\"I might join you, actually. The Willow Wood is peaceful this time of year. Plus, you might need your big brother to scare off any mischievous sprites.\\" I nudged him playfully. \\"The only thing mischievous around here is you, Carson. But company would be nice. Theurgists are stronger together, after all. And maybe you'll learn a thing or two,\\" I added with a wink. He laughed, a hearty sound that always seemed to lighten my spirit. \\"Deal, little sis. Just promise me one thing.\\" \\"And that would be?\\" I asked, raising an eyebrow. \\"No lectures on the properties of every plant we pass!\\" I feigned shock. \\"But that's the best part! Fine, no lectures, but if you eat something poisonous, don't expect me to be sympathetic.\\" We shared a look of understanding, the easy rapport that only siblings who had spent countless hours delving into the mysteries of Life together could share. As we continued deeper into the school's abundant, living grounds, it was clear to me—this day off was more than a simple break; it was a reminder of why we studied, why we practiced, and above all, why we cherished the vibrant world we were sworn to protect. For as Theurgists, we knew the threads of life were woven intricately, and our job was to ensure they remained unbroken. Today, I would do just that, with my brother by my side."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The air was rich with the scent of growing things, a fragrance that always brought a sense of calm to her soul. She twirled her wand between her fingers, watching the emerald at its tip catch the sunlight and throw speckles of light onto the grass at her feet. \\"Emmy, you look deep in thought,\\" came the easygoing voice of her twin brother, Carson, as he approached her. His own wand—a sapphire-studded, shorter version than hers—was slung casually over his shoulder. Emerald shot him a smile, the soothing environment melting away the stress of their demanding lessons. \\"I was just enjoying the quiet. We don't get days off often, Car.\\" Carson grinned back, easing down onto the grass beside her. \\"True enough. Think we should tell the others, or just let them find out on their own?\\" Emerald pondered for a moment. \\"I think they'll manage. Besides, I'm quite enjoying this little reprieve with my favorite brother.\\" Carson chuckled. \\"Lucky for me I'm your only brother.\\" Their laughter mingled with the soft rustling of leaves. It wasn't long before a few of their classmates stumbled upon them, lounging in their secluded spot amidst verdant vines and fluttering Spritelings. \\"Emerald! Carson! Did you hear? We have the whole day to ourselves!\\" exclaimed Lysander Thornpelt, a fellow second-year with a knack for herbology. \\"We heard,\\" Emerald replied with a smile. \\"Looks like we had the same idea. Join us?\\" As they settled in, talk turned from relaxation to their studies. \\"So, Emmy, any advice for the Midterm Mastery Exam? You aced it last year,\\" Lysander asked, eager for guidance. Emerald's expression turned thoughtful. \\"Study the behaviors of the living spells. Remember, the motive force of life magic is understanding. You need to connect, not command.\\" \\"It's about synergy,\\" Carson chimed in. \\"Balance and harmony.\\" One of the girls, Petra Stonebloom, her hair woven with fresh blooms, piped up. \\"You truly have a way with words and magic, Emmy. I saw you in practice, how the Life spells seem to dance around you.\\" \\"Perhaps,\\" Emerald said modestly, \\"but the real magic comes from within. From the heart.\\" \\"Wise words from a wise Theurgist,\\" Lysander teased, then grew serious. \\"Thank you, Emerald. And you too, Carson.\\" As the hours passed, more students joined, and the peaceful grove transformed into a lively open-air forum. Emerald felt a surge of pride, surrounded by her peers—each individual sharing and absorbing knowledge, all united by their calling as Life Wizards. When dusk painted the sky with hues of topaz and amethyst, their impromptu congregation finally dispersed, leaving the Spritethief siblings once again in quiet companionship. \\"It's been a good day,\\" Carson remarked. \\"You think we made a bit of a difference?\\" Emerald glanced around at the emptying garden, the air now crisp with the onset of evening. \\"I think so. But we'll see come the exams.\\" Together, Emerald and Carson Spritethief walked back to the School of Life, their conversation drifting like the leaves that meandered on the wind—two Theurgists bound by blood and the shared destiny within the Spiral."},{"prompt":"¿Como adelgazar 20 kilos sin dietas y con un entrenamiento en casa y en poco tiempo? Soy vigilante de seguridad y no tengo tiempo","completion":"Perder 20 kilos es una meta significativa que implica hacer cambios en tu estilo de vida tanto en la alimentación como en el nivel de actividad física. Es importante mencionar que aunque busques perder peso sin seguir una \\"dieta\\" tradicional, cualquier cambio efectivo en tu peso involucrará revisar y probablemente modificar tus hábitos alimentarios. Asimismo, la pérdida de peso segura y sostenible normalmente ocurre gradualmente, por lo que la noción de \\"poco tiempo\\" puede ser relativa y debería alinearse con recomendaciones saludables, que suelen estimar una pérdida de peso de alrededor de 0,5 a 1 kg por semana. Aquí hay algunas pautas generales que puedes considerar para perder peso: 1. **Evalúa tus hábitos alimenticios**: A. Incrementa tu consumo de vegetales y frutas. B. Reduce el tamaño de las porciones. C. Evita las bebidas azucaradas y limita el consumo de alcohol. D. Elige proteínas magras y carbohidratos complejos sobre las versiones procesadas. E. Reduce la ingesta de snacks poco saludables y alimentos altos en calorías, azúcares añadidos y grasas saturadas. 2. **Integra actividad física en tu rutina diaria**: A. Crea una rutina de ejercicios que puedas hacer en casa, como circuitos de entrenamiento con cuerpo completo que incluyan tanto ejercicios de resistencia (ejercicios con peso corporal, bandas de resistencia) como cardio (saltar la cuerda, subir y bajar escaleras). B. Trata de hacer al menos 30 minutos de ejercicio moderado la mayoría de los días de la semana. Si no puedes dedicar un bloque de 30 minutos, divide la actividad en sesiones más cortas de 10 o 15 minutos. 3. **Apostar por el entrenamiento en intervalos de alta intensidad (HIIT)**: Este tipo de entrenamiento es idóneo para quemar calorías en poco tiempo y potenciar el metabolismo. Puedes encontrar rutinas de HIIT que se ajusten a tu nivel de condición física y espacio disponible en casa. 4. **Mantente activo a lo largo del día**: A. Utiliza las escaleras en lugar del ascensor. B. Realiza caminatas cortas durante tus descansos. C. Haz ejercicios de estiramiento o movilidad ligera en tu puesto de trabajo si es posible. 5. **Bebe suficiente agua**: Mantente hidratado, ya que a veces la sed puede confundirse con hambre. 6. **Duerme bien**: La falta de sueño puede aumentar las hormonas relacionadas con el hambre y afectar tu capacidad para perder peso. 7. **Controla tu progreso**: Llevar un diario de alimentos y registrar tus entrenamientos puede ayudarte a mantener el rumbo y observar patrones o áreas que requieren ajustes. Es esencial ser realista y paciente. Perder 20 kilos, dependiendo de tu punto de partida, puede llevar meses y no es recomendable ni saludable intentar hacerlo en \\"poco tiempo\\" si esto implica una reducción drástica de calorías o un entrenamiento extremo sin descanso. Recuerda que antes de iniciar cualquier cambio significativo en tu régimen de ejercicio o alimentación, especialmente si tienes condiciones de salud preexistentes, debes consultar con un médico o un nutricionista profesional. Ellos pueden ayudarte a establecer un plan personalizado y seguro que se adecúe a tus necesidades y rutina diaria."},{"prompt":"¿Que snack comer para adelgazar a mansalva?","completion":"Cuando estás tratando de perder peso, es importante elegir snacks que te ayuden a sentirte satisfecho sin consumir demasiadas calorías. Los snacks bajos en calorías y ricos en nutrientes pueden prevenir el hambre entre las comidas y ayudar a controlar los antojos. Algunas opciones saludables y saciantes incluyen: 1. **Frutas y Verduras**: Son bajas en calorías y altas en fibra, vitaminas y minerales. - Bastones de zanahoria, pepino, apio o pimiento. - Rodajas de manzana o pera. - Bayas frescas o congeladas. - Cherry tomatos. - Gajos de naranja o mandarina. 2. **Frutos secos y semillas**: Aunque son más densos en energía (tienen más calorías por gramo), son ricos en proteínas y grasas saludables, que pueden ayudar a sentirse más lleno. Opta por porciones controladas (un puñado pequeño). - Almendras, nueces, pistachos (sin sal o azúcar añadida). - Semillas de calabaza o girasol. 3. **Yogur griego natural**: Excelente fuente de proteína y calcio, elige aquel sin azúcares añadidos y bajo en grasa. 4. **Hummus**: Puedes acompañarlo con vegetales crudos para un snack rico en proteínas y fibra. 5. **Palomitas de maíz**: Elige palomitas de aire caliente sin mantequilla ni azúcar, que son bajas en calorías y altas en fibra. 6. **Queso fresco o cottage**: Tiene alto contenido de proteína y puede combinarse con frutas o verduras para un snack completo. 7. **Barras de proteína o energéticas**: Es crucial leer las etiquetas para elegir aquellas que son bajas en azúcares añadidos y calorías. 8. **Huevos duros**: Son una excelente fuente de proteínas y te ayudarán a mantenerte lleno. Al optar por snacks, es importante tener en cuenta tanto el contenido nutricional como el tamaño de las porciones. Incluso los snacks saludables pueden contribuir al aumento de peso si se consumen en grandes cantidades. Siempre intenta prestar atención a las señales de hambre y saciedad de tu cuerpo y comer solo cuando realmente tengas hambre, en lugar de por aburrimiento o estrés. Además, es crucial que estos snacks formen parte de un enfoque más amplio para perder peso, que también incluya una dieta balanceada y actividad física regular. Integrar estos elementos en un estilo de vida saludable es la forma más efectiva de lograr una pérdida de peso sostenible."},{"prompt":"Necesito lo más barato para adelgazar que se pueda comprar en españa","completion":"Perder peso de forma económica en España o en cualquier otro lugar suele ser posible si te centras en alimentos básicos y no procesados que forman parte de una dieta equilibrada. Aquí te proporciono una lista de alimentos que son nutritivos, de bajo costo y pueden ayudarte a mantener o perder peso si se consumen en el contexto de una dieta balanceada y un estilo de vida activo: 1. **Verduras y frutas de temporada**: Comprar productos de temporada y locales suele ser más barato y están en su punto máximo de sabor y nutrición. 2. **Legumbres**: Lentejas, garbanzos, judías y otras legumbres son una excelente fuente de proteína y fibra, lo que te ayuda a sentirte satisfecho por más tiempo. Son muy baratas, especialmente si las compras secas y en paquetes grandes. 3. **Cereales integrales**: Opta por arroz integral, avena y pasta integral. Proporcionan más nutrientes y fibra que sus contrapartes refinadas, y promueven la saciedad. 4. **Huevos**: Son una fuente barata de proteínas de alta calidad y pueden prepararse de muchas maneras diferentes. 5. **Patatas**: Ricas en nutrientes y muy versátiles, las patatas pueden ser una parte saludable de tu dieta si no se fríen o se comen con salsas ricas en grasa. 6. **Carne magra**: Las opciones más baratas suelen incluir pollo o pavo. Busca ofertas o compra al por mayor y congela. 7. **Pescado enlatado**: Como las sardinas y el atún, suelen ser más baratos que el pescado fresco y son fuente de proteínas y ácidos grasos omega-3. 8. **Lácteos o alternativas de lácteos**: Leche, queso fresco y yogures naturales o bajo en grasa son opciones nutritivas y económicas. Opta por formatos familiares o envases más grandes que suelen tener mejor precio por unidad de medida. 9. **Agua del grifo**: Mantente hidratado bebiendo agua del grifo, la cual es segura y muy barata en España, en lugar de bebidas azucaradas o embotelladas. 10. **Frutos secos a granel**: Comprar frutos secos y semillas a granel suele ser más económico, y son buenos para un snack sano. Controla las porciones dado que son densos energéticamente. Cocinar y preparar tus propias comidas también es una forma de reducir costos comparado con comprar comida para llevar o preempaquetada. Las técnicas para bajar de peso no tienen por qué ser caras para ser efectivas; lo importante es priorizar alimentos integrales y minimizar el consumo de productos procesados y altos en calorías vacías. Por último, no olvides la actividad física. Caminar, correr y ejercicios de calistenia son completamente gratis y pueden ser sumamente efectivos para mantener un peso saludable."},{"prompt":"¿Los yogures mejor desnatados?","completion":"Los yogures desnatados (también conocidos como yogures sin grasa o 0%) pueden ser una buena opción si estás intentando reducir la ingesta de calorías y grasas, especialmente grasas saturadas que están presentes en los productos lácteos enteros. Elegir yogures desnatados tiene ventajas y desventajas: **Ventajas**: - Menor contenido calórico: Al eliminar la grasa, el yogur tiene menos calorías, lo cual puede ser beneficioso si estás tratando de crear un déficit calórico para perder peso. - Menor contenido en grasas saturadas: Reducir las grasas saturadas puede ser beneficioso para la salud cardiovascular. **Desventajas**: - Puede no ser tan saciante: La grasa tiene un efecto saciante en la alimentación, por lo que los yogures enteros podrían ayudarte a sentirte lleno por más tiempo. - Posible aumento de azúcares añadidos: Algunos fabricantes añaden azúcar a los yogures desnatados para mejorar el sabor que se pierde al quitar la grasa. Es importante leer la etiqueta nutricional para asegurarse de que no se está consumiendo demasiado azúcar añadido. - Posible disminución de la absorción de vitaminas liposolubles: Las vitaminas A, D, E y K son liposolubles, lo que significa que se necesitan grasas para su óptima absorción. Un yogur con algo de grasa podría ayudar a absorber mejor estas vitaminas. Dependiendo de tus necesidades nutricionales y tus preferencias personales, puedes elegir entre yogur desnatado, semidesnatado o entero. Lo importante es considerar el producto en el contexto de tu dieta general y tus objetivos de salud. Si eliges yogur desnatado, busca uno que no tenga azúcares añadidos y que contenga probióticos vivos, que son buenos para la salud intestinal. Siempre es útil leer las etiquetas y considerar la calidad general del yogur, incluyendo la cantidad de proteínas, la presencia de probióticos, el contenido de calcio y la cantidad de ingredientes añadidos como los azúcares y los sabores artificiales. En general, el yogur es un alimento nutritivo que puede formar parte de una dieta equilibrada. Si tienes dudas específicas sobre tu dieta o si estás realizando cambios importantes en tu alimentación, considera la posibilidad de consultar con un dietista o nutricionista registrado."},{"prompt":"[told from the perspective of experienced Theurgist Emerald Spritethief, there would be dialogue in this story:] (I was a 2nd-year student in the School of Life.

It'd been an arduous few weeks of intense practical examinations and theoretical incantations, and having a day off felt like a breath of revitalizing spring air, sorely needed and deeply appreciated. \\"Emmy! Wait up!\\" A voice called from behind me, a jovial tone barely concealed within it. I slowed my pace and turned, recognizing the voice of my brother instantly. Carson's approach was as boisterous as ever; The golden sun of his School of Fire fabric flickered mockingly across his robe as he caught up, a wide grin on his face. \\"What's the hurry? Afraid you'll miss a moment basking in the glorious emptiness of our schedule today?\\" Carson teased, elbowing me lightly in the ribs. I rolled my eyes, a smile tugging at my lips despite my intent to feign annoyance. \\"Quite the contrary, Carson. I was planning on enjoying the day away from the likes of you,\\" I retorted with a light laugh. \\"Ha! As if you could,\\" he shot back, nudging me again. \\"Besides, I hear there's something special happening in the Commons. Word has it that some sort of rare creature was spotted near the pond. Thought you’d be itching to check it out, given your affinity for all things living.\\" I perked up at that. My curious nature wouldn't allow me to miss out on a rare creature sighting. \\"Well, that's news to me. A wise decision to share, dear brother,\\" I said with genuine interest sparking in my voice. We made our way through the bustling streets filled with wizards of various schools and talents, each going about their own business or reveling in the lack thereof. The Commons was a hub of activity with the news of the sighting attracting not just scholars but curious onlookers and adventurers. We stood by the pond, now thronged by a crowd, and I craned my neck to catch a glimpse of whatever had garnered such attention. Just beneath the surface of the water, something shimmered with a spectral light, the outline of a creature both familiar and wholly enigmatic. \\"Any ideas, oh knowledgeable Emerald Spritethief?\\" Carson's question was loaded with genuine curiosity, despite his playful undertone. I squinted, focusing my senses, attuned to the pulse of life. \\"Let's see... by the glow of it, and the subtle aura of its being, I would speculate an Aethereal Elemental. Rare, indeed, often invisible to the naked eye and a conduit of pure, raw life magic.\\" A collective gasp rose from the crowd as I voiced my thoughts. See, knowledge always drew its own form of respect amongst the magical community of the Spiral. Carson seemed suitably impressed. \\"And what would a Theurgist do in the presence of such a marvel?\\" I glanced at him, a determined look in my eye, my voice steady and assured. \\"Why, attempt communion, of course. If it's indeed an Elemental, it could offer insight or bestow a boon of some sort.\\" Nodding to myself, I moved closer to the pond, the crowd parting before me as if by some unspoken consensus. I knelt by the water's edge, closed my eyes, and extended my consciousness towards the creature. Mental whispers of magic formed an ethereal bridge, my thoughts a gentle beckoning. \\"Creature of light and life, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, guardian of the living and seeker of knowledge,\\" I spoke, my mind enveloped in the essence of Theurgy. For a tense moment, there was only silent anticipation... Then, a soft voice hummed in response, a musical language that transcended words yet conveyed understanding and appreciation. \\"We dwell in the between, little Guardian. Your call is heard. Speak your wish, entwine your soul with the life-thread of the Spiral.\\" The crowd stood in breathless silence as I communed with the Elemental, a testament to the power of a day when a simple respite could turn into an extraordinary encounter. Today, I was not just a student, but a bridge to the wonders of the Spiral. And with each day came new magic to be discovered and respected, by both Theurgist and Pyromancer alike. Carson's smile beamed with pride, mirroring my own triumphant spirit. Indeed, the life of a wizard was nothing short of enchanting."},{"prompt":"script vente Sac à main","completion":"Titre: Découvrez notre superbe collection de sacs à main !

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model that utilizes the transformer architecture. The attention mechanism is a crucial component of the transformer model, allowing it to consider the relevance of each token within a sequence to better capture contextual relationships. In BERT, 12 or 24 attention layers are used, and each layer consists of several attention heads. The attention map in BERT output can be represented as a matrix, where each element indicates the attention weight assigned to a pair of input tokens. Higher weight values suggest stronger relationships and more influence between tokens, while lower weight values suggest weaker or no relationships. These attention maps are useful for understanding the self-attention mechanism of BERT and analyzing the learned relationships between tokens in a given input sequence."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Childrens Film Foundation (1976) (Color)(56 mins) - \\"Revels\\" - A young 'maid's' daughter (Rose) is indiscreetly listening to the servants discussing an upcoming revels amongst the court of a noble in Elizabethen England, only to overhear two shadier looking servants confirming that they've been paid off by the Spaniard, to create an embarssment for the noble, and weaken his credibility. Rose tells her mother, and together with her mother and the help of \\"BInham\\" a senior servant (and here an expy for one of Walsignham's agents) hatch a plan to ensure the revels are peaceful and enjoyable, with those paid by the \\"Spaniard\\" getting themselves planted firmly in the moat outside at the climax.","completion":"Title: \\"Revels\\" Synopsis: Set in the tapestry of Elizabethan England, \\"Revels\\" is a family-friendly film produced by the Children's Film Foundation in 1976. At the heart of the story is a spirited young girl named Rose, the daughter of a loyal maid in the service of a well-respected noble. Innocently eavesdropping on the conversations of court servants, Rose uncovers a sinister plot to discredit her master. While the excitement builds around an upcoming celebration – a grand revel held within the noble's court – Rose overhears a suspicious exchange between two unscrupulous servants and discovers they have been bribed by a mysterious Spaniard. Their task is to sabotage the festivities, shaking the noble's standing among his peers and weakening his influence. Fearing for the honor of the noble's house and her own family's livelihood, Rose confides in her mother, a woman of action and resourcefulness. Her mother, recognizing the gravity of the situation, enlists the support of Binham, a senior servant wise in the ways of court intrigue. Hinted to be an agent of the famed spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, Binham brings a blend of cunning and stagecraft to the devised countermeasure. Together, this unlikely alliance crafts an ingenious plan to thwart the mischief-makers and protect the noble's reputation. Amidst the grandeur of Elizabethan fashion, dance, and music, the film culminates in an elaborate set piece during the revels where the corrupt servants find themselves the unwitting stars of a comical mishap, landing them in the castle's moat to the mirth of all the guests. As the plot comes undone, Rose and her allies reveal the treachery to the noble and his guests, securing peace and a successful celebration. \\"Revels\\" delivers a tale of intrigue and adventure, all wrapped in the graceful, opulent setting of Elizabethan society. It teaches lessons about integrity, courage, and the importance of working together to overcome deceit. The film, though historically inspired, carries the timeless message of standing up for what is right, no matter the obstacles. Designed to both entertain and educate younger audiences, \\"Revels\\" ends on a joyful note with the promise of justice and prosperity for Rose, her mother, and their noble employer, while the conniving agents of the Spaniard rue the day they underestimated the cleverness of a young maid's daughter and her resolute protectors."},{"prompt":"I had that the wife of the noble , might be played by someone like Glenda Jackson?","completion":"Although Glenda Jackson was a notable film and stage actress during the 1970s, known for her powerful performances and dynamic presence, the Children's Film Foundation typically relied on lesser-known actors or sometimes even non-professionals for their productions, due to budget constraints. However, hypothetically speaking, if Glenda Jackson were to be cast in the role of the noble's wife in a film like \\"Revels,\\" her involvement would add a significant degree of gravitas and professionalism to the production. Here's how the casting could be fittingly imagined: **Lady Margaret:** Glenda Jackson Having Glenda Jackson assume the role of Lady Margaret, the noble's wife, would bring depth to the character and the narrative. Lady Margaret would be portrayed as a dignified and intelligent woman who, alongside her daughter Rose, becomes instrumental in exposing and defeating the plot against her husband. With her stage and screen experience, especially in historical dramas and in portraying strong female figures (consider her performances as Queen Elizabeth I), Jackson would provide an emotionally resonant and commanding performance. Her character would likely carry the grace of the Elizabethan court, while also demonstrating a subtle resilience and intuition that echoes the film's themes of loyalty and determination. The casting of Glenda Jackson in \\"Revels\\" would significantly raise the profile of the film and potentially draw more attention from audiences, given her status as a leading actress at the time. In an alternate reality where the budget allowed for such casting, her participation in the Children's Film Foundation project would indeed be a tremendous coup for the foundation."},{"prompt":"Assuming though that the CFF had budget constraints how might cheaper alternatives have been?","completion":"Considering the typical budget constraints for films produced by the Children's Film Foundation (CFF), it's more likely that they would cast either up-and-coming actors who had yet to establish themselves as household names or experienced character actors who may not have commanded as high a salary as a star like Glenda Jackson. The CFF often spotlighted British talent and sometimes even cast from local drama schools or community theaters. For a hypothetical casting alternative to Glenda Jackson in the role of the noble's wife in \\"Revels,\\" the production might have considered the following options: 1. **Experienced Television or Stage Actresses:** The CFF could cast a seasoned actress known mostly for her work on television or the stage, someone respected for her craft but less familiar to cinema audiences and therefore more affordable. 2. **Retired or Semi-Retired Actress:** They might look for an actress who had been well-known in earlier decades and had since retired or semi-retired from acting. Such an actress might be interested in taking a role for the enjoyment of participating in a family-friendly project and thus might be willing to work for a smaller fee. 3. **Local Theater Performers:** There's also the possibility of casting performers from regional theater companies. Such performers, while potentially very talented, would likely be less expensive and could bring authenticity and enthusiasm to the production. 4. **Drama School Graduates:** Recent graduates from drama schools would be eager to gain experience and exposure, and though they would be less known, they could bring fresh energy and new talent to the production without high costs. 5. **Part-Time or Hobbyist Actors:** They might consider actors who pursue acting as a part-time endeavor or as an extension of another career in the arts, and who might appreciate the opportunity for a role in a film even if it's not as financially lucrative. In any of these scenarios, the CFF would be able to find a talented actress who could bring depth and presence to the role of the noble's wife, contributing to the film's overall quality while staying within their financial limits."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I'll outline the conceptual structure of such a system: # 1. Text Input and Analysis The system would begin with an NLP module where the user can input descriptive text about a character. It might include physical attributes, clothing, poses, expressions, and even personality traits that could affect the posture or demeanor of the character. # 2. Concept Extraction The NLP module analyzes the input text to extract key pieces of information such as age, gender, body type, facial features, clothing style, and accessories. These words and phrases would be mapped to 3D model attributes. # 3. Database of 3D Assets A large database of 3D assets would be essential. This database would contain a variety of 3D models of body parts, clothing items, textures, and accessories that can be combined to create diverse characters. # 4. 3D Model Synthesis An AI algorithm would interpret the NLP-extracted attributes and start building the 3D character by selecting and synthesizing the appropriate assets from the database. It would account for anatomical coherence, layer clothing items appropriately, and ensure that textures and colors match the descriptions. # 5. Pose and Expression Adjustment With the physical attributes and clothing in place, the system would then adjust the character’s pose and facial expression. A secondary AI module or a neural network could be trained on a dataset of body languages and facial expressions to accurately reflect the character's described personality or emotional state. # 6. High-quality Rendering Once the character is composed, a high-quality renderer would be used to create a realistic or stylized image or video of the character, based on the user's needs. This renderer needs to be capable of generating fine details, realistic lighting, and shadows to produce a lifelike or artistically stylized result. # 7. Machine Learning Feedback Loop To improve over time, the system would incorporate a machine learning feedback loop where users can refine or correct the generated characters and their feedback, along with the original descriptions, would be used to train the system further. # 8. User Interface A user-friendly interface would be necessary to allow non-expert users to interact with the system. It could provide a preliminary 3D model preview and allow users to make tweaks and refinements before the final high-quality rendering takes place. # Tech Stack Considerations: - **NLP Module**: Transformers like GPT-3 or BERT for language understanding. - **AI Algorithm for Model Synthesis**: Machine learning models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) specialized in 3D object composition. - **Database of 3D Assets**: Could be custom-built or sourced from existing 3D libraries, tagged and categorized to be easily searchable. - **Rendering Engine**: High-end engines like Unreal Engine or proprietary software designed for realistic lighting and materials. - **Feedback Loop**: Utilize reinforcement learning or active learning to incrementally improve results. Developing such a high-quality text-to-3D character generation system would be a cutting-edge venture, which likely would be the result of a collaboration between computer scientists, AI researchers, 3D modelers, and possibly linguists and artists. As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, creating truly high-quality and accurate text-to-3D characters automatically is a developing field, with significant advances required in both AI and 3D modeling technologies."},{"prompt":"Diseñame el mejor entrenamiento sin material para estar como Amadeo llados","completion":"Amadeo Llados es reconocido como un entrenador personal y experto en fitness.

The objective is to loop over each server in \`groups['host_servers']\`, and then for each server, loop over the \`domains\` to capture the \`node_manager_port\` for each domain. Here's how to do that with a nested loop in Ansible: \`\`\`yaml - name: Gather Node Manager Port Mappings for Each Domain set_fact: nm_ports_per_domain: >- {{ nm_ports_per_domain | default({}) | combine( { domain_info.key: domain_info.value.node_manager_port } ) }} loop: \\"{{ lookup('dict', hostvars[host].domains).items() }}\\" vars: host: \\"{{ outer_item }}\\" when: \\"'domains' in hostvars[host]\\" loop_control: loop_var: domain_info tags: [always] loop: \\"{{ groups['host_servers'] }}\\" loop_control: extended: yes loop_var: outer_item - name: Map Unique IPs to Node Manager Port Mappings set_fact: ip_to_nm_ports: >- {{ ip_to_nm_ports | default({}) | combine( { hostvars[outer_item].ansible_host: nm_ports_per_domain } ) }} loop: \\"{{ groups['host_servers'] }}\\" loop_control: loop_var: outer_item tags: [always] \`\`\` Here's what this does: 1.

It then uses \`lookup\` to get each server's \`domains\` and loop over them with \`domain_info\` as the loop variable. 4. We ensure that \`hostvars[host].domains\` is used to access domains of the current \`outer_item\` in the outer loop. 5. Finally, the \`nm_ports_per_domain\` fact is combined with the current \`domain_info\` data point. This will address the issue with undefined \`domain_item\` variable by nesting the loops correctly and using \`domain_info\` to reference inner loop items.

Let's address the issue correctly this time by performing the following steps to fix the task. Firstly, we need two separate plays (not nested loops within the same task as previously suggested). The first play (\`Gather Node Manager Port Mappings for Each Domain\`) will iterate over the servers. For each server, it will gather the domain port mappings. The second play (\`Map Unique IPs to Node Manager Port Mappings\`) will utilize the data collected from the first play. Start by iterating through each of the \`host_servers\`. Then for each \`host_server\`, loop through its \`domains\`. After doing that, set a fact to map the ports accordingly. Here's the corrected version: \`\`\`yaml - name: Gather Node Manager Port Mappings for Each Domain hosts: host_servers gather_facts: no tasks: - set_fact: nm_ports_per_domain: >- {{ nm_ports_per_domain | default({}) | combine( { item.key: item.value.node_manager_port } ) }} loop: \\"{{ lookup('dict', hostvars[inventory_hostname].domains) }}\\" loop_control: loop_var: item when: \\"'domains' in hostvars[inventory_hostname]\\" tags: [always] - name: Map Unique IPs to Node Manager Port Mappings hosts: host_servers gather_facts: no tasks: - set_fact: ip_to_nm_ports: >- {{ ip_to_nm_ports | default({}) | combine( { hostvars[inventory_hostname].ansible_host: nm_ports_per_domain[inventory_hostname] } ) }} tags: [always] \`\`\` Make sure each play runs independently and sequentially. The first one will set the fact \`nm_ports_per_domain\` in each host's context, mapping the domain names to their node manager ports. The second play will then take that information and set another fact \`ip_to_nm_ports\` that associates server IPs to the node manager ports of their domains. Note that \`inventory_hostname\` is the name of the current host as configured in your inventory. Please re-run the playbook with the above adjustments. This structure should yield the desired result without running into variable undefined issues within the loop context."},{"prompt":"try again","completion":"Apologies for the confusion earlier. I misunderstood the structure of your playbook. Here's a revised approach to accomplish the task using a single play. You need to iterate over the servers, and for each server, iterate through its domains to collect \`node_manager_port\` information. Then store this data in a variable that maps each \`ansible_host\` to their respective \`node_manager_port(s)\`. \`\`\`yaml - name: Gather and Map Node Manager Port Mappings for Each Domain hosts: all gather_facts: no tasks: - name: Initialize nm_ports_per_domain if not defined set_fact: nm_ports_per_domain: {} when: nm_ports_per_domain is not defined - name: Gather Node Manager Port Mappings for Each Domain per Host set_fact: nm_ports_per_domain: >- {{ nm_ports_per_domain | combine( { ansible_host: { item.key: item.value.node_manager_port } } ) }} loop: \\"{{ lookup('dict', hostvars[inventory_hostname]['domains']).items() }}\\" loop_control: loop_var: item vars: ansible_host: \\"{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_host'] }}\\" when: \\"'domains' in hostvars[inventory_hostname]\\" delegate_to: localhost run_once: true tags: [always] - name: Display nm_ports_per_domain debug: var: nm_ports_per_domain delegate_to: localhost run_once: true tags: [always] \`\`\` Here's how this approach works: 1. We start by initializing the \`nm_ports_per_domain\` fact if it's not already defined to avoid undefined errors. 2. Then, we collect the Node Manager Port for each domain for each host-server and set this in the \`nm_ports_per_domain\` fact. The \`loop\` runs through the \`domains\` using the \`dict\` lookup and sets a nested dictionary where each \`ansible_host\` key contains a dictionary of domains with their respective \`node_manager_port\`. 3. The \`run_once: true\` directive ensures that these tasks run only once, and not on each host in the inventory. 4. We use \`delegate_to: localhost\` to carry out the fact setting operations on the Ansible controller rather than on the remote hosts as the facts are collected globally. 5. Finally, the \`debug\` task is there to display the \`nm_ports_per_domain\` variable for verification purposes. Run your playbook with these tasks included, and you should be able to build the \`nm_ports_per_domain\` mapping correctly. Adjust the debug output according to your needs or use the information as necessary for subsequent tasks."},{"prompt":"Crea el mejor entrenamiento completo hiit sin material para ser el mejor luchador del mundo. Tengo sobrepeso y no tengo mucho tiempo porque trabajo en seguridad privada","completion":"Antes de comenzar cualquier entrenamiento intenso como el HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), especialmente si tienes sobrepeso o no estás acostumbrado a hacer ejercicio regularmente, es crucial que consultes con un médico o un profesional del ejercicio para asegurarte de que es seguro para ti. Adicionalmente, perder peso y convertirse en \\"el mejor luchador del mundo\\" conlleva una serie de factores, incluyendo dieta, recuperación, práctica constante de habilidades de combate, y no solo el ejercicio. El HIIT es efectivo porque alterna entre periodos cortos de actividades intensas y periodos de descanso o actividad de baja intensidad.

Речевое поведение включает использование разных стилей и регистров языка, невербальные элементы коммуникации, такие как жесты, мимика, интонация и др. 4. Знаковая система - это система, которая состоит из знаков, которые представляют собой абстрактные символы, используемые для передачи определенного значения или информации. Примеры знаковых систем включают письменные языки (например, кириллицу, латиницу), символы математики и нотации музыки. Язык как знаковая система обосновывается тем, что он использует знаки (слова) для передачи значения и информации. 5. Функции языка включают коммуникативную, познавательную, эмоционально-выразительную, регулятивную и мета-коммуникативную функции. Коммуникативная функция языка заключается в передаче и понимании сообщений между людьми, например, в разговоре или письме. Познавательная функция языка используется для передачи знаний и информации о мире. Эмоционально-выразительная функция языка выражает эмоции и чувства. Регулятивная функция языка помогает контролировать поведение других людей и себя. Мета-коммуникативная функция языка относится к обсуждению самого акта коммуникации и языка. 6. Уровни языка включают фонетический, морфологический, синтаксический, лексический и семантический уровни. Фонетический уровень языка относится к звуковому составу и произношению слов. Морфологический уровень связан с формой слов и их структурой. Синтаксический уровень относится к позиции слов в предложении и их синтаксическим отношениям.

These measures capture the degree of variation or fluctuation in asset prices or returns over a specific period. The most widely used volatility measures include: 1. Historical Volatility: Historical volatility is a straightforward measure that calculates the standard deviation of asset returns over a given historical period. It provides an estimate of the range of future possible price movements based on the assumption that historical patterns will repeat. Historical volatility is commonly applied to daily, weekly, or monthly returns. 2. Implied Volatility: Implied volatility is derived from options pricing models. It represents the market's expectation of future volatility, specifically regarding the underlying asset's price. Through options pricing, implied volatility reflects the demand for options contracts and investor sentiment. Higher implied volatility generally indicates greater uncertainty or risk in the market. 3. GARCH Models: Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models are econometric models that capture the volatility clustering phenomenon, wherein periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more volatility and vice versa. GARCH models incorporate both recent and long-term volatility trends, providing insights into future volatility patterns and forecasting accuracy. 4. Range-Based Volatility: Range-based volatility measures focus on the range between the highest and lowest prices within a specific interval. This measure considers the price range as a proxy for volatility, assuming that larger price ranges indicate higher volatility. Common range-based measures include the Average True Range (ATR) and the Parkinson Historical Volatility. 5. Parkinson Historical Volatility: The Parkinson Historical Volatility is a method that utilizes high, low, and close prices to calculate volatility. It assumes that volatility is more accurately measured when considering price extremes. The Parkinson Historical Volatility aims to capture the \\"realized\\" or observed volatility over a specific period. 6. Garman-Klass Volatility: Garman-Klass Volatility is another measure derived from high, low, open, and close prices. It incorporates the logarithmic returns and volume of trading to calculate volatility. This measure is widely used in the foreign exchange market and is known for its ability to capture short-term trends and price movements. 7. Realized Volatility: Realized volatility is a measure that calculates volatility using high-frequency data, such as intraday or tick-by-tick prices. By examining more granular price movements, realized volatility provides a more precise estimate of short-term volatility. It is commonly used in high-frequency trading and risk management applications. Each of these measures has its own advantages and limitations, and their suitability depends on the specific context and objectives of the analysis. It is important to choose an appropriate volatility measure based on the data availability, time horizon, and research or trading requirements."},{"prompt":"give a theoretical framework of volatility forecasting methods","completion":"Title: Theoretical Framework of Volatility Forecasting Methods Introduction: Volatility forecasting is a crucial aspect of financial analysis and risk management. Accurate forecasts of asset price volatility help investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers make informed decisions and develop effective risk mitigation strategies. This theoretical framework aims to provide an overview of various volatility forecasting methods, including both traditional econometric models and advanced techniques based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. 1. Traditional Econometric Methods: a) Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) Models: ARCH models, developed by Engle in the 1980s, capture the volatility clustering phenomenon. They assume that recent volatility impacts future volatility. ARCH models incorporate lagged squared residuals, which act as proxies for past volatility, to predict future volatility. b) Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) Models: GARCH models extend ARCH models by incorporating both lagged residuals and lagged conditional variances. They capture the persistence and asymmetry in volatility, allowing for more accurate forecasts. GARCH models, such as GARCH(1,1), are widely used due to their simplicity and ability to capture long-term volatility patterns. c) Exponential Smoothing Models: Exponential smoothing models, such as the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), assign weights to past volatility observations with a declining pattern. These models provide greater weight to recent observations, making them more responsive to recent changes in volatility. EWMA models are commonly used for short-term volatility forecasts. 2. Volatility Models Based on High-Frequency Data: a) Realized Volatility Models: Realized volatility models directly utilize high-frequency data, such as intraday or tick-by-tick prices, to calculate volatility. They capture the price fluctuations within very small time intervals, providing more accurate and precise volatility forecasts, particularly in intraday trading strategies. The Hayashi-Yoshida model and the Zhang-Ning model are examples of realized volatility models. b) Range-Based Volatility Models: Range-based volatility models use the range between the highest and lowest prices over a specific interval as a proxy for volatility. By considering price extremes, these models capture the relative intensity of price movements and provide insights into short-term volatility patterns. Examples of range-based volatility models include Parkinson's volatility estimator and the Garman-Klass estimator. 3. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Techniques: a) Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR applies a non-linear regression algorithm to forecast volatility based on historical data and relevant predictor variables. It can uncover complex relationships between variables and capture non-linear patterns. SVR has gained popularity due to its ability to handle large datasets and its potential for improved forecasting accuracy. b) Neural Networks: Neural networks, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are powerful techniques for volatility forecasting. They can capture non-linear patterns, dependencies, and long-term memory effects. Neural networks have shown promising results in capturing complex volatility dynamics but require careful training and validation. c) Random Forests and Ensemble Techniques: Random Forests and ensemble techniques combine the predictions of multiple models to generate more accurate and robust volatility forecasts. These techniques leverage the diversity of individual models and exploit their collective wisdom. They provide a well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Conclusion: Volatility forecasting is significant for financial decision-making and risk management. Traditional econometric models such as ARCH, GARCH, and exponential smoothing provide solid foundations for forecasting methods. Models based on high-frequency data, including realized volatility and range-based volatility, offer improved accuracy for short-term predictions. Moreover, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, such as SVR, neural networks, and ensemble methods, enable the capture of complex patterns and enhance forecasting performance. The choice of a suitable volatility forecasting method depends on data availability, forecasting horizon, model assumptions, and the desired level of accuracy. Understanding the theoretical framework of these methods equips researchers and practitioners with the necessary knowledge to select appropriate techniques and make informed decisions in real-world financial scenarios."},{"prompt":"explain the application of machine learning models in volatility forecasting","completion":"Machine learning models have gained significant popularity in the field of volatility forecasting due to their ability to capture complex patterns and extract valuable insights from vast amounts of data.

Here are the seven original principles of Universal Design simplified with examples: 1. **Equitable Use**: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. - *Example*: Providing subtitles on videos benefits those who are deaf or hard of hearing, non-native speakers, and even those in noisy environments. 2. **Flexibility in Use**: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. - *Example*: A museum offering touchscreen information kiosks with adjustable height ensures that both children and adults, including those in wheelchairs, can access information comfortably. 3. **Simple and Intuitive Use**: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. - *Example*: Elevators with pictorial buttons as well as numbers help non-readers or those unfamiliar with the language to understand how to use them. 4. **Perceptible Information**: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. - *Example*: Crosswalks with auditory signals and vibrating surfaces alert visually impaired individuals when it’s safe to cross the street. 5. **Tolerance for Error**: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. - *Example*: A smartphone that auto-corrects typing mistakes or has an undo option for recently deleted content. 6. **Low Physical Effort**: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably, and with a minimum of fatigue. - *Example*: Doors with sensors that automatically open reduce physical effort for everyone, including those carrying heavy items or people with mobility impairments. 7. **Size and Space for Approach and Use**: Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of the user’s body size, posture, or mobility. - *Example*: Wide aisles in a store accommodate people in wheelchairs, as well as those using pushchairs or shopping carts. Universal Design 2.0 builds upon these principles to further emphasize social sustainability, health and wellness considerations, and cultural inclusion. In simpler terms, it not only aims to make designs physically accessible but also socially inclusive, fostering environments where everyone feels welcome and considered. For example, a playground that incorporates both traditional equipment and sensory-friendly areas tailored for children with autism creates an inclusive space where all children can play together. Additionally, a community center offering programs in multiple languages with culturally diverse staff members embodies the spirit of Universal Design 2.0, connecting and serving a broader spectrum of the community. Universal Design 2.0 continues the commitment to creating environments, products, and services that are accessible to the greatest number of people, including those with diverse abilities and backgrounds."},{"prompt":"Dime preguntas tipo: quien es mas ...?","completion":"1. ¿Quién es más rápido, Usain Bolt o Cristiano Ronaldo? 2. ¿Quién es más inteligente, Albert Einstein o Stephen Hawking? 3. ¿Quién es más talentoso, Leonardo da Vinci o Michelangelo? 4. ¿Quién es más influyente, Mahatma Gandhi o Martin Luther King Jr.? 5. ¿Quién es más exitoso, Elon Musk o Jeff Bezos? 6. ¿Quién es más carismático, Barack Obama o Justin Trudeau? 7. ¿Quién es más popular, Taylor Swift o Beyoncé? 8. ¿Quién es más versátil, Meryl Streep o Daniel Day-Lewis? 9. ¿Quién es más prolífico, William Shakespeare o Miguel de Cervantes? 10. ¿Quién es más icónico, Marilyn Monroe o Audrey Hepburn?"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},B={key:1};function q(i,e,l,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",H,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
