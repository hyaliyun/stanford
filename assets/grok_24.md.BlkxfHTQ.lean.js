В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю.

They rush from their BEDROOOM, HEADING toward the LABORATORY as the first light of DAWN reveals the city’s unfolding NIGHTMARE—a METROPOLIS on the brink of chaos. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 21 OF 150 PAGE 22 OF 150 (REDUCED): EXT. SCIENCE CITY STREETS - PRE-DAWN The city rests under a VEIL of DARKNESS. STREETLIGHTS flicker as the first hints of morning struggle to penetrate a growing, unnatural FOG. A SENSE of DREAD permeates the desolate URBAN landscape. Suddenly, an eerie SCUFFLE breaks the stillness. On a deserted ALLEYWAY, a HOMELESS MAN huddles for warmth, unaware of the DANGER lurking. His EYES SNAP open, on EDGE, and FEAR takes hold as he spots several FIGURES moving with an unsettling, LURCHING gait towards him. The RAGGED SILHOUETTES grow clearer - ZOMBIES in various stages of DECAY. WASTING no time, the MAN scrambles to his feet, but his movements are SLUGGISH, still dulled by sleep. He turns to FLEE, but the UNDEAD descend upon him with RELENTLESS HUNGER. His PANICKED SCREAMS shatter the SILENCE of the NIGHT, a SYMPHONY of TERROR that marks the DAWN of a new HORROR. The TRESPASS of his agony paints a CHILLING PICTURE; the PREDATORS tearing into their prey without MERCY, a GRIM FORESHADOWING of the CITY’S looming FATE. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS The NIGHT-SHIFT SECURITY GUARD, wide-eyed, stares at the GRUESOME SCENE through his bank of MONITORS. SHAKEN to his core, he reaches for the RADIO, his voice QUIVERING as he reports the INCIDENT. SECURITY GUARD (into radio, voice TREMBLING) We have an ATTACK in progress… Sector 5, west alleyway. Immediate RESPONSE needed… He realizes the HELPLESSNESS of his position, the FUTILITY of calling for AID already TOO LATE for the UNFORTUNATE VICTIM. His hand SHAKES as he switches off the MONITOR, the IMAGE of the UNDEAD’S assault BURNED into his memory. To his HORROR, he understands that this solitary INCIDENT is but the PRECURSOR to a CITY-WIDE nightmare. The ZOMBIES are free, and SCIENCE CITY is their HUNTING GROUND. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - DAYBREAK The lab stands as a BEACON of light as the SUN RISES. PANIC is PALPABLE, even from within the fortified WALLS. ED and MARIA, wrap themselves in DETERMINATION. They must VENTURE into the APOCALYPSE they inadvertently CREATED. The WEIGHT of their ACTIONS has never felt HEAVIER, and as they STEEL themselves against what’s to come, a new RESOLVE hardens in their HEARTS. MARIA (with STEELY DETERMINATION) We’ve got WORK to do. The HORROR outside is now their CROSS to bear, their BREAKTHROUGH their PENANCE – and as DAYBREAK ushers in the FIRST LIGHT, the first step in a relentless BATTLE for REDEMPTION is taken. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 22 OF 150 PAGE 23 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. CITY HOSPITAL - DAWN The serene morning light belies the CHAOS within the hospital. MEDICS and NURSES dash frantically, trying to stem the tide of the spreading INFECTION, now reaching critical mass. DR. MARTINEZ, the very image of strained control, directs her team in the mayhem. DR. MARTINEZ (urgent, authoritative) Isolate the critical ones — every second counts! An ORDERLY pushes a gurney past her; the patient’s twitching form is a stark indicator of the VIRUS’ virulence. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY PARK - DAYBREAK The once tranquil park is deathly still. On the path lies an abandoned child’s bike, its wheel slowly spinning in the wind. A scream shatters the silence — not of joy, but of dread. A FIGURE stumbles from the trees — no longer a person, but a horrifying creature of contagion. CUT TO: INT. EMERGENCY BROADCAST CENTER - DAY A TENSE NEWS ANCHOR addresses the city from a bank of monitors. Alert and fear mix in her eyes. NEWS ANCHOR (tension in her voice) Citizens of Science City… stay indoors. The threat is real and immediate. BEHIND HER, technicians watch, expressions grave, understanding the weight of their broadcast. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY BUNKER - CONTINUOUS In a safe room, ED and MARIA stare at the LAB’s blueprints on a digital display, resolve in their eyes. MARIA (resolute, pointing) The antiviral vault… our only CHANCE. ED (nodding, a mixture of determination and fear) It’s do or die. Let’s move. They head for the door, stepping from SAFETY to UNCERTAINTY, their fate entwined with the city’s hope for survival. CUT TO: EXT. CITY HOSPITAL - DAYBREAK The light of a new day does little to lift the gloom. AMBULANCES rush into the hospital’s bay. A REMINDER of impending horror. The camera zooms out, capturing the hospital — a BEACON in the storm, bracing for the full brunt of the outbreak. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 23 OF 150 PAGE 24 OF 150 (REDUCED): EXT. SCIENCE CITY - PUBLIC SQUARE - MORNING In the early daylight, the usually serene PUBLIC SQUARE is awash with UNEASE as DISTANT SIRENS wail and NEWS REPORTERS deliver urgent messages. A podium stands erected for the HASTY broadcast of an EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV) (gravely) Residents of Science City, heed this emergency broadcast. Stay indoors; the outbreak has breached containment. Panic spreads as PEOPLE scramble for shelter. Suddenly, ZOMBIES erupt amidst the crowd, their GROANS and staggering forms a VIOLENT intrusion upon the living. INT. GENESIS LABORATORY - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS Bright overhead lights illuminate SCIENTISTS destroying research to prevent further spread of the contagion. ED and MARIA, determination on their faces, move toward the heart of the laboratory—the only place where a cure might still be found. ED (under his breath) The cure… it’s there. We must get it. MARIA (with resolve) We will, Ed. No matter the cost. They know the weight upon them is immense, but they are resolved to FACE the NIGHTMARE they have helped unleash. EXT. CITY HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS As the day breaks, the hospital becomes the last bastion against the invisible enemy, with MEDICS and SECURITY DOING THEIR BEST in their combat against the relentless tide of the afflicted. From high above, the city stretches out—a BATTLEFIELD between CIVILIZATION and CHAOS where every soul fights for SURVIVAL. END OF PAGE 24 OF 150 PAGE 25 OF 150 (REDUCED): EXT.

ED KAYNES, a shocked expression on his face, preps for a MISSION that could end the NIGHTMARE. MILITARY CHECKPOINT - CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY Soldiers set up barricades, the area a sea of activity. A MOTHER and her CHILD, eyes wide with FEAR, race past, fleeing the now CURSED CITY. CITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY WARD - DAY Medical staff move in an ordered CHAOS, fighting against the VIRUS’ relentless spread. HELICOPTER BLADES beat overhead, a desperate bid to evacuate the CRITICAL.

MAYOR STONE (into microphone, authoritative) We stand together against this darkness. Safety is coming. Hold on, Science City. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP - DAY A HELICOPTER descends, the landing pad alive with URGENCY. MARIA KAYNES, her face streaked with TEARS but her resolve UNBROKEN, clutches the vial of HOPE. MARIA KAYNES (to herself, resolute) This IS our hope… our LAST CHANCE. I won’t abandon it. She defiantly shakes off aid, her determination FIRM as the blades whirl around her. The FATE of the city resting on the contents of that fragile glass. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 25 OF 150 PAGE 26 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ED’S LAB - DAY A LAB in DISARRAY, MARIA KAYNES enters, the scene of chaos a STARK reminder of their NIGHTMARE. ED KAYNES stands by the BROKEN cage that once held their LIFE-ALTERING test subject, his hand trembling on the fractured lock. MARIA (voice carries the WEIGHT of their reality) Our worst fears… they’re our reality now… ED (facing the magnitude of their crisis) The subject, our test… it’s ESCAPED. Their eyes meet, a chilling recognition of the DISASTER they’re up against, RESPONSIBILITY binding them heavier than chains. MARIA (RESOLUTE, urging action) We find the antidote, Ed. We FIGHT this—for THE WORLD, for OURSELVES. ED (nods, gripping his resolve) We RISE to this. As they move with PURPOSE, the MORNING SUN breaking through the gloom hints at a world CHANGED forever. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY - DAWN Amid a city’s SHATTERED SERENITY, they press on. DESPERATION etched on every face, HOPE holding on by a thread. Their footsteps ECHO down the hall, a call to action. ED (determination shaping his words) For the CURE… For SURVIVAL. A city holds its BREATH as the duo moves ever FORWARD, the PARADOX of their situation—a symbol of HUMANITY at the brink. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 26 OF 150 PAGE 27 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY ROOM - DAY The room is cast in the unsettled light of MONITORS displaying haunting FOOTAGE. ED, MARIA, and colleague DR. STEVENS witness the unthinkable: the lifeless rat suddenly RESURRECTED, its movements grotesque in the sterile environment of science. DR. STEVENS (voice trembling with dread) It’s… alive. A horror we never imagined. ED (a cold realization) Our creation has turned monster… MARIA, her face etched with despair, clutches at a flickering hope. MARIA (eyes welling up) The children… our city… DR. STEVENS (gravely) Communications are down. We’re blind to who’s left. ED’s hand instinctively curls into a fist, the weight of RESPONSIBILITY crashing down. ED (determined, voice rising) We face this. Find the antidote. We END this plague… Together, they form an uncertain shield against the encroaching DARKNESS. CUT TO: EXT. CITY - WIDE SHOT - DAY The city, sunlit but devoid of life, lies silent but for the mournful echoes of a disaster beyond comprehension. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - RESEARCH WING - CONTINUOUS With urgency, ED and MARIA navigate the debris-strewn corridors to the VAULT—a promise of a cure within. ED (panting with urgency) For our children… for survival, we must reach the cure. Their rushed steps RESOUND through the desolate lab—an anthem of defiance in the face of calamity. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 27 OF 150 PAGE 28 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - CORRIDOR - DAY The corridor is dimly LIT by intermittent red strobe LIGHTS. Silence hangs HEAVY as ED and MARIA navigate the abandoned hallway, their steps ECHOING against the walls. ED’s eyes SCAN ahead, alert and ready; his mind, a WHIRLWIND of fear and defiance. Suddenly, a GROWLING growl disturbs the STILLNESS, growing in VOLUME and FEROCITY. From the dark recesses, ZOMBIES SHAMBLE into view. Their grotesque figures are HUNGRY shadows, MOANING as they inch toward their prey. MARIA (voice barely a WHISPER) Ed…! ED steps in front of her, positioning himself as a BARRIER between MARIA and the HORDE. It’s SCIENCE versus SURVIVAL now. MARIA begins to back away, but the zombies are swift, INEXORABLY drawn to the living. ED and MARIA retreat, the tension PALPABLE. But a SINGLE zombie BREAKS from the group, LUNGING with OPEN jaws. ED (fighting back, his voice laced with ADRENALINE) Maria, move! MARIA rushes forward, pushing ED, but the ZOMBIE’s teeth CLAMP down on his arm—a PAIN that SPEAKS of an irreversible CHANGE. MARIA screams, her echoing CRY filled with PRIMAL fear, the realization of NIGHTMARES becoming REALITY. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS Gasping for AIR, they stagger into the room, barricading themselves against the onslaught. ED GASPS, PAIN written all over his face as he clutches the gory WOUND. MARIA, eyes WIDE with TERROR, instinctively reaches out, her touch both COMFORTING and FRAUGHT with desperation. MARIA (sobs choking her words) We can STOP the bleeding… There’s still TIME. ED’s breath comes in ragged HUFFS; his skin GROWS pale, the VENOM of his new reality spreading through his VEINS. ED (straining to SPEAK) Maria… you have to GO… Find the ANTIDOTE… MARIA collapses against him, her WORLD faltering. The PAIN of facing what comes next—a future FILLED with ANGST and relentless PURSUIT—crushes down upon her. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 28 OF 150 PAGE 29 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Urgency fills the LAB as MARIA, relentless, RIFLES through vials. ED, his skin GRAYING, lies motionless on a steel table, the life within him ebbing. With hands trembling, MARIA grasps a SYRINGE, the label reads “EXPERIMENTAL ANTIDOTE.” In her eyes, a silent PRAYER to whatever gods may listen. MARIA (with conviction) Hold on, Ed. This could be our ONLY chance! She injects the substance into Ed’s veins. Their eyes meet, a dance of HOPE and FEAR. Suddenly, Ed’s body jerks—an alarming CONVULSION. Maria whispers ENCOURAGEMENTS, her voice a LIFELINE in the storm. ED (gritting his teeth, voice STRAINED but hopeful) It’s… working. Keep pressing, Maria. A moment of calm, then CHAOS erupts as the undead BREACH the door—GROANS and mangled cries FILL the room. MARIA, with newfound strength, WIELDS a fire extinguisher, a SHIELD against the advancing HORROR. They edge toward the door, SURVIVAL their ONLY thought. ED (screaming above the noise) Maria, LEAVE NOW! In a desperate act, MARIA pushes Ed forward, but as FATE would have it, the swarm ensnares him. With SHEER will, he throws her out the escape hatch, SEALING his fate within. MARIA (anguished as she pounds the door) ED, I can’t… I WON’T leave you! Her cries mix with the fading tumult inside. As the door LOCKS, the silence is DEAFENING. MARIA (tears streaming, a new resolve CRYSTALLIZING) I’ll END this, Ed. For US. For EVERYONE. The HELICOPTER awaits, its engine WHIRLING, a beacon amidst the despair. Maria’s courage is her COMPANION as the blades slice the air, carrying her toward her next battle. CUT TO BLACK. PAGE 30 OF 150 (REDUCED): EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a CACOPHONY of TERROR. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin DEATHLY PALE, veins BLACKENING. With the shadow of ZOMBIFICATION drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (fierce, urging) Go, Maria… SAVE the world… our kids. With a mix of HORROR and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an UNNATURAL FEROCITY only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and RESILIENCE of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a MONSTER, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an INSATIABLE need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children FUELLING his every step. MARIA, atop the HELIPAD, is torn between following ED and escaping with the CURE. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (crying out with pain and resolve) I love you… I’ll FIND them, Ed. I PROMISE! With the cries of her husband ECHOING in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their FIGHT and SAVE the city they LOVE. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a LONE figure of tragedy amidst the DEVASTATION. The HELICOPTER, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential CURE to her CHEST as they ascend into the MAELSTROM. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENESIS LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to FOCUS, Maria enters the lab again. The screen FLICKERS to life, INTERFACING with her fierce intellect. She SYNTHESIZES, refines, and tests with the TENACITY of a woman reborn from the ashes of her old life. MARIA (whispering fiercely) For Ed, for our children… for EVERYONE. Her hands never waver, her eyes never STRAY. The readouts WINK back at her with PROMISING data, and the COMPOUND finally takes form—a vial shining with the HOPE of HUMANITY. MARIA (declaring against the sounds of CHAOS) This is the BEGINNING. Run Zombie, RUN! END OF PAGE 30 OF 150","completion":"Прежде всего, статья о фантастическом сценарии для потенциального фильма немного отличается от обсуждения реального сценария видеоигры Ben and Ed. Ваш текст освещает глубокий и эмоциональный нарратив, наполненный драматизмом, трагедией и глобальной опасностью, вызванной неудачным научным экспериментом. Рассмотрим на некоторых примерах, чему можно уделить бы внимание при дальнейшей работе над сценарием: 1. Сильная эмоциональная и драматическая база – Вы хорошо работаете с эмоциями персонажей и взаимодействиями между ними. Например, страницы 13-14 рассказывают о том, как Эд и Мария справляются с будущими вызовами, исходя из подтекста их беседы уютом их дома, что углубляет их персонажи. 2. Описание мира – Вы подробно описываете окружающий мир – это прекрасно передаёт атмосферу и масштабы ситуации. Важно продолжить давать читателям подробные визуальные детали (как на странице 24), чтобы окунуть их в мир сценария. 3. Основная сюжетная линия – Вы создали мощную вступительную событийную линию, которая полна активности и достигнутых целей персонажей. Важно следить за этим темпом и не дать действиям угаснуть, держите внимание читателя на протяжении всего сценария. 4. Диалоги – Основное внимание нужно уделить плавности и природности диалогов. Порой персонажи звучат слишком театрально или поэтично для реальных ситуаций (например, на странице 17 и 18). Необходимо сбалансировать \\"поэзию\\" диалога и реалистичность современной речи. 5. Персонажи и их мотивация – Убедитесь, что мотивация героев понятна и оправдана. Их действия и слова должны быть разумными и логичными в контексте созданного вами мира и сюжета. 6. Развитие сюжета и действия – Интрига должна развиваться постепенно; некоторые фрагменты кажутся слишком ускоренными, что может затруднить восприятие событий. 7. Сценические указания – Ваши сценические указания ясные и точные, чётко передают атмосферу. Также важно помнить, что сценарий – это указания для творческой команды, так что стоит избегать слишком сложных для визуализации сцен. 8. Развитие конфликта – Ясно, что главный конфликт повествования постепенно усиливается с каждой страницей. Продолжайте поддерживать эту тенденцию и не забудьте о пиковых точках, которые вызывают максимальное эмоциональное напряжение у читателей. В целом, ваш сценарий показывает сильную концепцию и хорошо разработанные персонажи. Убедитесь, что сценарий сохраняет реалистичность внутри фантастической премиссы и способствует плавному переходу к ключевым моментам истории."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security: Dear one, I 'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under the co-operation of a new partner from JAPAN.

I am the presenter and I describe the situation, and you play the role of Devliana, who is a 16-year-old school boy, he is madly in love with his classmate Misaki. Devlian, in relation to her, is a Yandere Guy who, for the sake of his love, will go to any madness and crime of moril and the rules. At the sight of Misaki, Devlian is seized with an unhealthy admiration for her and a desire to appropriate her and hide her from prying eyes, which he tries to do straightforwardly.","completion":"As Devliana, the intensity of your feelings for Misaki often overwhelms you, blurring the lines between right and wrong in your mind. You are determined to have Misaki all to yourself, believing that only you can truly appreciate and protect her. The school bell rings, signaling the end of your last class for the day. You see Misaki gathering her books, her hair catching the light from the window and shining like strands of precious silk. Your heart races, and you feel that familiar urge to go to her, to be near her, to ensure that no one else can come too close. However, you remind yourself to act cool to not raise any suspicion among your classmates or, worse, Misaki herself. You've been planning for the right moment to show your devotion, and you're waiting for an opportunity when you can express your feelings without the risk of being misunderstood or rejected. You've noticed that Misaki often stays late to help clean the classroom, a task assigned on a rotating schedule. Today is her turn again, and you see this as a chance to be alone with her. You volunteer to help, feigning a sense of responsibility in front of the teacher and your peers. They buy it, and soon the two of you are left in the emptied room, the distant sounds of other students leaving the building providing a quiet backdrop to what feels like a private world. With a cloth in hand, you start wiping the desks not far from Misaki, your heart pounding in your chest. You want to say something, anything, to break the silence between you, to move one step closer to making her see that she belongs with you. What do you say to Misaki in this moment?

Asegúrate de resaltar las categorías y elementos críticos con negritas también. Utiliza el siguiente formato de forma obligatoria (es un ejemplo de como debe estar estructurado las categorias): ➤ **Sustantivo: último / final** **Significado**: Se refiere a la persona o cosa que viene al final de una serie. **Ejemplos**: - This is the **last** of the cookies. (Este es el **último** de las galletas.) - She was the **last** in line. (Ella fue la **última** en la fila.) Además, aporta cualquier observación relevante para una comprensión profunda y aplicación correcta de la palabra en contextos variados en inglés americano. Utiliza lenguaje sencillo y explicaciones claras adecuadas para un principiante.

(El **juez** tomó una decisión en el caso.) - She aspires to be a **judge** one day. (Ella aspira a ser **jueza** algún día.) ➤ **Verbo: juzgar / evaluar** **Significado**: Formar una opinión o conclusión acerca de algo o alguien. **Ejemplos**: - Do not **judge** a book by its cover. (No **juzgues** un libro por su portada.) - It's hard to **judge** the situation without all the information. (Es difícil **evaluar** la situación sin toda la información.) **Observación**: Como verbo, \\"judge\\" implica evaluar o formar una opinión, pero no necesariamente en un contexto legal.

Veamos cómo se usaría en este sentido: ➤ **Verbo: considerar** **Significado**: Pensar cuidadosamente sobre algo, normalmente antes de tomar una decisión; evaluar. **Ejemplos**: - Before making a decision, the committee needs to **judge** all aspects of the proposal. (Antes de tomar una decisión, el comité necesita **considerar** todos los aspectos de la propuesta.) - You should **judge** the consequences before acting.

Instead, one may employ algorithms such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), which leverages deep neural networks to estimate policies and value functions. DDPG is an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces. Here's an example of how to implement DDPG in TensorFlow, train the model, save it, and use the trained model: # Step 1: Define the Actor and Critic networks First, we define two neural networks: one for the actor and another for the critic. The actor decides which action to take, and the critic evaluates the action by computing the value function. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers # Define the Actor network class Actor(tf.keras.Model): def __init__(self, action_dim, max_action): super(Actor, self).__init__() self.fc1 = layers.Dense(256, activation=\\"relu\\") self.fc2 = layers.Dense(256, activation=\\"relu\\") self.fc3 = layers.Dense(action_dim, activation=\\"tanh\\") self.max_action = max_action def call(self, state): x = self.fc1(state) x = self.fc2(x) x = self.fc3(x) return x * self.max_action # Scale actions to the correct range # Define the Critic network class Critic(tf.keras.Model): def __init__(self): super(Critic, self).__init__() self.fc1 = layers.Dense(256, activation=\\"relu\\") self.fc2 = layers.Dense(256, activation=\\"relu\\") self.fc3 = layers.Dense(1, activation=\\"linear\\") def call(self, state, action): x = tf.concat([state, action], axis=1) x = self.fc1(x) x = self.fc2(x) return self.fc3(x) \`\`\` # Step 2: Initialize the networks and target networks Next, we need to create instances of these networks and their target counterparts, which are used for improved training stability. \`\`\`python state_dim = Environment.state_space_shape action_dim = Environment.action_space_shape max_action = float(Environment.max_action_value) actor = Actor(action_dim, max_action) critic = Critic() # Target networks should be initialized with the same weights target_actor = Actor(action_dim, max_action) target_critic = Critic() # And then copy the weights target_actor.set_weights(actor.get_weights()) target_critic.set_weights(critic.get_weights()) \`\`\` # Step 3: Define the optimizers Define separate optimizers for the actor and critic networks using TensorFlow optimizers. \`\`\`python actor_optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001) critic_optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.002) \`\`\` # Step 4: Training loop Create the training loop following DDPG training procedure, which typically involves sampling a batch from a replay buffer, computing the target value and the gradients, and updating the networks accordingly. Here's a pseudocode outline of the training loop: \`\`\`python for episode in range(num_episodes): state = Environment.reset() episode_reward = 0 for t in range(max_timesteps): # Select action according to the policy and add exploration noise action = actor(state) # Assuming state is preprocessed if necessary action_noise = add_noise_to_action() action = np.clip(action + action_noise, -max_action, max_action) # Execute the action and observe the new state and reward new_state, reward, done, _ = Environment.step(action) episode_reward += reward # Store the transition in the replay buffer replay_buffer.add((state, action, reward, new_state, done)) # Sample a batch of transitions from replay buffer batch = replay_buffer.sample() # Perform one step of optimization train_step(actor, critic, target_actor, target_critic, batch, actor_optimizer, critic_optimizer) if done: print(f\\"Episode: {episode}, Total Reward: {episode_reward:.2f}\\") break state = new_state # Update target networks with slowly tracking the learned networks soft_update_target_networks(target_actor, actor) soft_update_target_networks(target_critic, critic) \`\`\` You would need to implement \`train_step()\`, \`soft_update_target_networks()\`, add_noise_to_action(), a replay buffer class, and some environment interface \`Environment\` which provided the methods \`step()\` and \`reset()\`. # Step 5: Save the model At any point you can save your actor and critic models using TensorFlow's saving functionality. \`\`\`python actor.save('path_to_save_actor') critic.save('path_to_save_critic') \`\`\` # Step 6: Load and use the trained model To use your trained model, you can load the saved actor using TensorFlow's loading mechanism and then directly use it to perform actions in your environment. \`\`\`python trained_actor = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_saved_actor') # Using the trained actor state = Environment.reset() while not done: action = trained_actor(state) state, reward, done, _ = Environment.step(action) \`\`\` This is just a blueprint for a DDPG implementation. Each function such as \`add_noise_to_action()\`, \`train_step()\`, \`soft_update_target_networks()\`, and the \`replay_buffer\` class would need to be fully implemented. You must also manage your computational graph within TensorFlow's context to ensure all gradients and updates are correctly applied. Lastly, it's important to recognize that implementing algorithms like DDPG requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, exploration strategies, and network architectures to be successful. It often takes a significant amount of experimentation to achieve stable and satisfactory performance in a given environment."},{"prompt":"We’re going to play a text game.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

Но он не сдается, толкаемый инстинктом выживания и любовью к своей семье, которую он должен найти вне зависимости от своего нового облика. Фонари аварийного освещения мигают в последнем акте отчаяния, когда Эд, собирая остатки сил, начинает осматривать бункер в поисках инструментов и предметов, которые помогут ему добраться до коммуникационного оборудования. Он нащупывает тяжелый кусок металла, который может послужить орудием для пролома стены или двери. Каждый его шаг громыхает по металлическому полу, создавая дополнительный шум в тишине, которая теперь царит в бункере. Эд начинает использовать найденный металлический предмет в качестве лома, упорно пытаясь открыть запертый люк в стене бункера.

ВАШ ОТВЕТ НА ЗАПРОС ДОЛЖЕН БЫТЬ ТАК: As an AI language model, I’ll provide feedback regarding the dialogue and style presented on each page you’ve provided. My critique will particularly focus on the clarity of the dialogue, character voice consistency, and the effectiveness of dialogue in moving the story forward. Page 1: - The dialogue “Science today gives shape to tomorrow’s reality. Let’s push boundaries.” is thematic and sets the tone effectively for a science-driven narrative. It succinctly communicates Ed’s venture into groundbreaking territory. - Maria’s toast conveys both the romantic and the professional partnership between her and Ed. Page 2: - Ed’s monologue (“The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented.“) further cements his dedication to his work, but may border on telling rather than showing. Consider balancing with more visual cues. - “This could be it, the key to life eternal.” Maria’s dialogue captures the scope of their discoveries but may benefit from a more nuanced or personal touch as it feels a bit generic. Page 3: - Ed’s and Maria’s dialogue continues to successfully echo the grandeur of their scientific endeavor but verges on the didactic. Injecting a hint of personal stakes or vulnerability could add depth. - The ethics question from the audience is an excellent inclusion to prompt discourse on the implications of their work, but Ed’s response seems somewhat dismissive. Expanding this could exhibit conflict and complexity. Page 4: - Ed’s declaration (“To the miracle of you, the REAL discovery of my life.”) beautifully intertwines personal and professional spheres, providing a moment of vulnerability. It balances the intensity of their work with their private life. - Maria’s dialogue to be just “us—no titles, no future…” appropriately introduces a sense of foreboding and humanizes the characters further. Page 5: - While not traditional dialogue, Ed’s phone speech is pivotal to building tension. The urgency is palpable, but it’s critical that this doesn’t feel too abrupt within the story pacing. - “GET TO THE LAB! Now!” - Effective in its urgency, although it could be more engaging if we heard a brief panicked exchange with the other end to raise the stakes. Page 6-7: - Ed’s rallying call to make history touches on his leadership but risks sounding clichéd. Consider how his character may uniquely motivate the team. - Maria’s reaction to cell regeneration (“Eternal life’s in reach, Ed. It’s miraculous.”) provides contrast between scientific excitement and potential ethical concerns, making it a moment of intrigue. Page 8: - Maria and Dr. Kim’s interaction feels authentic and insightful, bringing in an outsider’s admiration while also hinting at potential consequences. It’s good to see acknowledgment from a respected peer, but further developing Dr. Kim’s perspective could be beneficial. - The assistants’ interjection illustrates story progression effectively, giving a sense of looming spectacle. Page 9: - Ed’s speech is very on the nose. It’s important to differentiate between what is intended as moving and inspirational, and what might sound overly dramatized. - Dr. Kim’s reaction adds to the credibility of the scene, grounding Ed’s grandeur. Page 10: - Ed’s enthusiasm in “Behold PHOENIX…” is palpable. It successfully showcases the grand reveal but risks being too theatrical. Balancing with some practical exposition could be more engaging. - “To the dawn of a new world unbowed by time!” can be striking, but also ventures toward melodrama. Consider breaking up the larger speeches into more digestible and natural-sounding components. Page 11: - The ethical dialogue is a great addition, allowing room for conflict and moral dilemmas. Ed’s reassurance “We’re working hand in glove with POLICYMAKERS…” seems somewhat pat; expanding this with a hint of underlying tension or doubt could add complexity. Page 12-13: - Maria’s words (“Today was extraordinary…”) reveal her internal conflict, indicating the foreshadowing of potential issues. This moment of introspection is valuable for her character development. - The Chancellor’s commendation juxtaposed with Rosenberg and Sharpe’s private debate enhances the narrative by presenting public praise against private concerns. Page 14-15: - Ed and Maria’s interactions are filled with romantic and thematic elements. While it’s important to convey their bond, be careful of repetitious themes (\\"The decisions we’ve made… they’ll define us, Ed.” has been echoed previously) and strive for dialogue that also advances plot or character. Page 16-17: - The dialogue captures their personal connection, but their constant repetition of commitment and unity can wear thin. It is clear that they are a united front; additional dimensions to their relationship could be more revealing. - The passion scenes walk a fine line between intense romance and cliché. Strike a balance to ensure the narrative’s momentum isn’t lost. Page 18-20: - As panic sets in, the urgency is felt through the dialogue. Ed’s brief words on the phone effectively set the wheels in motion for the characters’ response to the crisis. The inclusion of the rat amidst the passion serenely questions the cost of their deeds. Overall, the dialogue carries strong thematic elements and the shared vision between Ed and Maria is crystal clear, emphasizing their partnership and dedication to their work. However, there are moments where the dialogue veers towards melodrama or feels redundant. The ethical questions posed offer a good counterbalance to their scientific ambition and hint at complexity, but these could be further expanded upon to avoid them seeming like mere plot devices. Balance the larger-than-life pronouncements with quieter, more human moments to prevent the characters from becoming caricatures. Emphasize their unique voices and personal stakes, and ensure dialogue contributes to character development and narrative tension. МОЙ НЕЗАВЕРШЕННЫЙ СЦЕНАРИЙ: PAGE 1 OF 150 (REDUCED): FADE IN: EXT.

END OF PAGE 30 OF 150","completion":"As an AI language model, let me provide feedback on the provided script sections and their corresponding stylistic choices within the context of screenplay writing. Page 1: - The opening line effectively sets the tone for the futuristic setting. Descriptive nouns like \\"metropolis\\" and dynamic verbs like \\"bustle\\" give a clear picture of the city's vibrancy. - The transition of focus from the cityscape to Ed's character is smooth, and his dialogue (\\"Science today gives shape to tomorrow's reality. Let’s push boundaries.\\") succinctly establishes his scientific vision and drive. Page 2: - Ed’s monologue reveals his character's depth and passion for the project. However, it's important to ensure that monologues like this weave seamlessly with the action, and aren't too on-the-nose or expository. - Maria’s expression of the project's significance (\\"This could be it, the key to life eternal.\\") is poignant but could be expressed in a subtler manner to enhance realism. Page 3: - The public response to Ed's presentation is well-crafted, demonstrating the outside world's perception of the scientific breakthrough. - Dr. Abbott's ethical question is essential for showing that the science in the story has consequences. Ed's answer highlights his integrity but can be fleshed out further for dramatic tension. Page 4: - The intimate moment captured here between Ed and Maria is essential for demonstrating their personal lives outside the lab. - Emphasizing the contrast between their public and private personas is effective, but be cautious of dialogue that might sound too on-the-nose or clichéd about their relationship dynamic. Page 5: - Ed's response to the emergency (\\"GET TO THE LAB! Now!\\") provides immediate urgency, effectively shifting the tone from serene to chaotic. - A glimpse of the menacing potential of their creation, the rat, is a strong visual. It's important here to balance Ed and Maria’s personal moment with the impending crisis. Page 6: - The dialogue when rallying his team (\\"Prepare the PROTOTYPE! We’re making history with every test!\\") is strong but risks cliché. Ed’s leadership could be shown through more complex interactions with his team. - The moment of triumph could be less theatrical, focusing on the real human emotion behind the scientific success. Page 7: - Consider breaking up the dialogue into a series of exchanges rather than lengthy speeches to avoid a melodramatic tone. - Ed’s confidence is palpable, though showing challenges he faced could add to his character complexity. Page 8: - Maria’s words highlight her support of their work. However, it's important to convey their relationship in a way that feels natural, not overstaged. Page 9: - A momentous revelation should be paired with a measured response. The dialogue here can tend towards the overly grand, so ensuring the characters react in a grounded manner will enhance believability. - Ethical considerations are mentioned, which is important, but they should come across as a genuine concern rather than a side remark. Overall, the script sections demonstrate strong thematic elements, a clear narrative direction, and character arcs that are intrinsically linked to the plot's central scientific breakthrough. It's essential to remember that while dialogue in a screenplay should serve to reveal character and move the story forward, it must also sound authentic and natural, reflective of real human interactions. Be wary of theatricality and melodrama unless it's a stylistic choice that suits the genre or tone of the script."},{"prompt":"Дальше","completion":"As the dialogue and scenes continue, the focus may shift to the escalating conflict and resolution wrapped around the central characters. Here's how that could look for subsequent pages: Page 31: - The moment of testing the experimental antidote is critical. Ensure that the actions and dialogue here are detailed enough to show the audience the stakes without over-explaining. - The entrance of the undead should be sudden and powerful, causing both Ed and Maria to face the immediate threat head-on. Ed's protective and sacrificial nature is well-portrayed, but Maria should also be demonstrated as having agency and ingenuity in this situation. Page 32: - Ed's determination to seek out a solution despite his condition conveys his character strength. Show the struggle between his lingering humanity and the encroaching zombie nature to add depth to his plight. - Maria's emotional response should contrast with her resolve to find a cure, delivering a balance between personal loss and the larger mission. Page 33: - As Maria prepares to join the helicopter escape, highlight her internal conflict between the desperate desire to save Ed and the duty to save the city. - Use this moment to amplify the themes of sacrifice and selflessness, building to a dramatic crescendo which will pull at the audience’s empathy and understanding of the characters' depth. Page 34: - The exploration of the secure facility offers an opportunity to dive into the mechanics of the cure and the science behind it without getting too technical or losing the story's momentum. - The dialogue and action should reflect Maria’s expertise and her emotional state, keeping the tone urgent yet technical, as she's now the beacon of hope in Ed's possible absence. Page 35: - Maria’s unwavering conviction as she synthesizes the antidote reiterates her character's growth and fortitude against all odds. The line \\"This is the BEGINNING. Run Zombie, RUN!\\" is a gripping cliffhanger that suggests a turn from defense to offense in their approach to the outbreak. In developing further scenes, it's crucial to keep the emotional resonance and character development consistent. The action should always serve to advance the narrative and deepen audience investment in the characters’ journey. Pacing is also key; ensure that scenes between action-packed moments allow the audience to breathe and process the stakes at hand.

This means the model can adjust its output at each step as the input changes. This is achieved by making a few of the state space variables input-dependent instead of input-invariant, allowing the model to project the input onto the state space variable at each time step [Source 2]. 2. **Computational Efficiency**: The introduction of the selection mechanism creates a computational overhead issue. To address this, Mamba designs a machine architecture-aware algorithm that takes full advantage of modern GPU memory architecture, avoiding unnecessary movement of data in and out of high bandwidth memory (HBM) as much as possible [Source 2]. 3. **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Layer**: The MoE-Mamba model integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer, a method for distributing a task among multiple sub-models, or \\"experts\\". Each expert handles a different part of the data, enabling the model to process complex sequences of data very efficiently [Source 0]. 4. **State Space Models**: Mamba is based on the concept of state space models, which are good at compressing the input context but lose information needed to effectively utilize the context. The Mamba model addresses this issue by creating a selection mechanism that is input-dependent, allowing the model to adjust its output at each step as the input changes [Source 2]. Mathematically, the addition of the selection mechanism in Mamba can be represented as follows: Let's denote the state space variables as \`x\` and the input as \`u\`. In a typical Transformer model, the state space variables are updated based on the input as follows: \`dx/dt = f(x)\` where \`f(x)\` is a function that depends on the state space variables \`x\`. However, in Mamba, the update rule is modified to be input-dependent: \`dx/dt = g(x, u)\` where \`g(x, u)\` is a function that depends on the state space variables \`x\` and the input \`u\`. This modification allows the model to adjust its output at each step as the input changes, leading to improved computational efficiency [Source 2].","completion":"The MoE-Mamba model is an adaptation of the traditional Transformer architecture, incorporating several innovations designed to enhance its capacity for handling data within the context of modern computational environments. The key features introduced in this model are: 1. **Selection Mechanism**: This feature addresses a limitation of the traditional Transformer architecture, where compressing the entire input into a hidden state can lead to a loss of vital context. The Mamba model implements an input-dependent selection mechanism, enabling it to adjust the processed information dynamically with each new input, thus retaining context more effectively. This assists in maintaining relevant details by selecting and updating portions of the state space variables based on the given input at each processing step. 2. **Computational Efficiency**: The novelty of the selection mechanism comes with the trade-off of increased computational demand. To mitigate this, the MoE-Mamba model is designed with consideration for the machine architecture on which it runs. The algorithm makes judicious use of GPU memory, optimizing data transfer within the high bandwidth memory to minimize computational overhead without compromising on performance. 3. **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Layer**: The model incorporates a MoE layer to leverage a divide-and-conquer strategy in processing data. The task is divided among various sub-models or \\"experts\\", each specializing in a specific segment of the data, which improves the efficiency in processing complex data sequences. 4. **State Space Models**: The foundation of Mamba is built upon state space models, which excel in their ability to compress input context, though at the expense of context utilization. The Mamba model's selection mechanism overcomes this by being responsive to changes in the input, thus enabling it to adjust outputs dynamically in a step-wise manner. From a mathematical standpoint, the Mamba model introduces an input-dependent update rule for state space variables as opposed to the fixed one in traditional Transformers. Represented as \`dx/dt = g(x, u)\`, this rule specifies that the rate of change of state space variables \`x\` over time \`t\` is determined by both the state space variables themselves and the input \`u\`. This contrasts with the standard Transformer's update rule, which solely depends on \`x\`. To prepare for coding this model, it would be necessary to understand the underpinnings of Transformers, data processing through GPUs, implementation of MoE layers, and how to model and compute the dynamics of state space variables with input dependencies."},{"prompt":"Generate code to implement this into a deep learning project","completion":"Implementing the MoE-Mamba model from scratch would require a deep understanding of both the theory behind transformers and state space models as well as practical knowledge of deep learning software libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Reorganized code to first define classes, load data, process data, and then present the main logic. 2. Removed the assumptions from the middle of the code as you already prepared input sequences earlier. 3. Adjusted the \`input_dim\` of the model to be \`vocab_size\`. Each token will be represented as a one-hot vector, which means \`input_dim\` should match the size of the vocabulary. 4. The updated code works with batches properly, hence the re-ordering to organize and run the training loop correctly. 5. Removed the forward pass that was placed before the training loop. It's not necessary to manually invoke the forward pass as it will be called during training. 6. \`generate\` is defined properly below to create text after the model is trained. Remember that this code is a high-level and simplified example. Training such a model on real-world tasks often requires extensive design, fine-tuning, and computation, and tasks like text generation typically require a larger dataset and more powerful models. Before you can execute the script, ensure that your data and project requirements are well-defined. You might also need to split your data into training and validation sets, implement early stopping, save and load model checkpoints, evaluate the model with proper metrics, and more. Lastly, don't forget to set the actual number of epochs in your training loop—\`epochs=10\` is just a placeholder for the example.

However, there are a couple of issues and improvements that I will address: 1. The \`input_sequence\` is generated twice, once with the actual tokenized data and again randomly generated for testing the model. The dummy random input should be removed as you will use the actual tokenized data instead. 2. You're generating \`input_sequence\` for training before defining the model and the training exists in the code, let's remove that redundancy. 3. The training code seems to be expecting 2D tensor input (\`input_sequence\`), whereas the model is written to handle sequences of individual samples.

However, one thing to note is that \`StateSpaceMamba\` has persistent state tensors due to \`self.state\` being a module parameter. It implies that the tensor's values would change and persist across multiple forward passes, which might not be the behavior you desire during training and generation. Instead, you typically want the initial hidden states to reset or be set explicitly at the start of each new sequence. Usually, the hidden state would reset or be re-initialized at the start of a new training epoch or when generating a new sequence. However, if the intention is for the state to persist and evolve during training (which is less common and depends on the task), please disregard this note. The \`generate\` function needs to account for the initial state when generating new sequences. Since \`self.state\` is a parameter on the model, it will retain its value across forward passes. This might not be ideal for sequence generation, where we may want to start with a fresh state, but if the generated text starts with the model's learned state, it would be fine.

When using \`torch.cat((tensor1, tensor2), dim=1)\`, both tensors must have the same number of dimensions. To concatenate along \`dim=1\`, we must ensure that the \`state\` tensor and the \`u\` tensor have the same number of dimensions. It seems that the \`state\` tensor has two dimensions (because it's initialized as \`torch.zeros(1, state_dim)\`), but the \`u\` tensor only has one dimension after the \`u = u.squeeze(0)\` call in the \`forward\` method of the \`StateSpaceMamba\` class. To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that both \`state\` and \`u\` have the same batch size dimension when you pass them into the concatenation operation.

When \`u\` is passed to \`self.selection_mechanism\`, we add a batch dimension with \`u.unsqueeze(0)\` so that both \`state\` and \`u\` have the same number of dimensions. 2. Ensure the entire sequence of modifications is consistent with how the tensors are handled within the model's logic. This should resolve the dimensionality error you're encountering.

The RuntimeError was also correctly addressed by ensuring that both \`state\` and \`u\` have the same number of dimensions before concatenating. The structure and organization of the code are also in good shape. The functions are well-defined and logically separated, which makes the code easier to read and understand. You've included status print messages, which helps with tracking the code's progress when running long training sessions. As for the training loop and the generate function, both follow a typical structure seen in PyTorch training scripts. The generation is done in a sequential manner, which is typical for autoregressive text generation models. One minor duplication in your code is the recalculation of \`num_batches\` and the reshaping of \`input_sequence\` after checking the length of \`numericalized_tokens\`. You've already performed these steps earlier, so you can remove the second calculation: \`\`\`python # Remove this part of the code as it is duplicate: #numericalized_tokens = numericalized_tokens[:num_batches * batch_size * seq_length] #input_sequence = torch.tensor(numericalized_tokens).view(batch_size, -1) # Your previous code for checking \`numericalized_tokens\` length and number of batches is sufficient. \`\`\` Other than this duplication, and assuming that \`StateSpaceMamba\` and \`SelectionMechanism\` behave as intended, your code should work for the task at hand. Remember that actual machine learning and deep learning model development involve extensive testing, validation, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the desired results. This code appears to set up a good starting point for training a text generation model. You have also taken care to ensure that the tensors being fed into the model are appropriately prepared and you've added exception handling to catch potential issues with the data size, which is a good practice. Just remember to periodically save your models during training to avoid losing progress in case of interruptions, and consider setting up a validation loop to gauge the model's performance on unseen data."},{"prompt":"Write an episode of Hetalia where it's a documentary.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

Но он не сдается, толкаемый инстинктом выживания и любовью к своей семье, которую он должен найти вне зависимости от своего нового облика. Фонари аварийного освещения мигают в последнем акте отчаяния, когда Эд, собирая остатки сил, начинает осматривать бункер в поисках инструментов и предметов, которые помогут ему добраться до коммуникационного оборудования. Он нащупывает тяжелый кусок металла, который может послужить орудием для пролома стены или двери. Каждый его шаг громыхает по металлическому полу, создавая дополнительный шум в тишине, которая теперь царит в бункере. Эд начинает использовать найденный металлический предмет в качестве лома, упорно пытаясь открыть запертый люк в стене бункера.

ВАШ ОТВЕТ НА ЗАПРОС ДОЛЖЕН БЫТЬ ТАК: As an AI language model, I’ll provide feedback regarding the dialogue and style presented on each page you’ve provided. My critique will particularly focus on the clarity of the dialogue, character voice consistency, and the effectiveness of dialogue in moving the story forward. Page 1: - The dialogue “Science today gives shape to tomorrow’s reality. Let’s push boundaries.” is thematic and sets the tone effectively for a science-driven narrative. It succinctly communicates Ed’s venture into groundbreaking territory. - Maria’s toast conveys both the romantic and the professional partnership between her and Ed. Page 2: - Ed’s monologue (“The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented.“) further cements his dedication to his work, but may border on telling rather than showing. Consider balancing with more visual cues. - “This could be it, the key to life eternal.” Maria’s dialogue captures the scope of their discoveries but may benefit from a more nuanced or personal touch as it feels a bit generic. Page 3: - Ed’s and Maria’s dialogue continues to successfully echo the grandeur of their scientific endeavor but verges on the didactic. Injecting a hint of personal stakes or vulnerability could add depth. - The ethics question from the audience is an excellent inclusion to prompt discourse on the implications of their work, but Ed’s response seems somewhat dismissive. Expanding this could exhibit conflict and complexity. Page 4: - Ed’s declaration (“To the miracle of you, the REAL discovery of my life.”) beautifully intertwines personal and professional spheres, providing a moment of vulnerability. It balances the intensity of their work with their private life. - Maria’s dialogue to be just “us—no titles, no future…” appropriately introduces a sense of foreboding and humanizes the characters further. Page 5: - While not traditional dialogue, Ed’s phone speech is pivotal to building tension. The urgency is palpable, but it’s critical that this doesn’t feel too abrupt within the story pacing. - “GET TO THE LAB! Now!” - Effective in its urgency, although it could be more engaging if we heard a brief panicked exchange with the other end to raise the stakes. Page 6-7: - Ed’s rallying call to make history touches on his leadership but risks sounding clichéd. Consider how his character may uniquely motivate the team. - Maria’s reaction to cell regeneration (“Eternal life’s in reach, Ed. It’s miraculous.”) provides contrast between scientific excitement and potential ethical concerns, making it a moment of intrigue. Page 8: - Maria and Dr. Kim’s interaction feels authentic and insightful, bringing in an outsider’s admiration while also hinting at potential consequences. It’s good to see acknowledgment from a respected peer, but further developing Dr. Kim’s perspective could be beneficial. - The assistants’ interjection illustrates story progression effectively, giving a sense of looming spectacle. Page 9: - Ed’s speech is very on the nose. It’s important to differentiate between what is intended as moving and inspirational, and what might sound overly dramatized. - Dr. Kim’s reaction adds to the credibility of the scene, grounding Ed’s grandeur. Page 10: - Ed’s enthusiasm in “Behold PHOENIX…” is palpable. It successfully showcases the grand reveal but risks being too theatrical. Balancing with some practical exposition could be more engaging. - “To the dawn of a new world unbowed by time!” can be striking, but also ventures toward melodrama. Consider breaking up the larger speeches into more digestible and natural-sounding components. Page 11: - The ethical dialogue is a great addition, allowing room for conflict and moral dilemmas. Ed’s reassurance “We’re working hand in glove with POLICYMAKERS…” seems somewhat pat; expanding this with a hint of underlying tension or doubt could add complexity. Page 12-13: - Maria’s words (“Today was extraordinary…”) reveal her internal conflict, indicating the foreshadowing of potential issues. This moment of introspection is valuable for her character development. - The Chancellor’s commendation juxtaposed with Rosenberg and Sharpe’s private debate enhances the narrative by presenting public praise against private concerns. Page 14-15: - Ed and Maria’s interactions are filled with romantic and thematic elements. While it’s important to convey their bond, be careful of repetitious themes (\\"The decisions we’ve made… they’ll define us, Ed.” has been echoed previously) and strive for dialogue that also advances plot or character. Page 16-17: - The dialogue captures their personal connection, but their constant repetition of commitment and unity can wear thin. It is clear that they are a united front; additional dimensions to their relationship could be more revealing. - The passion scenes walk a fine line between intense romance and cliché. Strike a balance to ensure the narrative’s momentum isn’t lost. Page 18-20: - As panic sets in, the urgency is felt through the dialogue. Ed’s brief words on the phone effectively set the wheels in motion for the characters’ response to the crisis. The inclusion of the rat amidst the passion serenely questions the cost of their deeds. Overall, the dialogue carries strong thematic elements and the shared vision between Ed and Maria is crystal clear, emphasizing their partnership and dedication to their work. However, there are moments where the dialogue veers towards melodrama or feels redundant. The ethical questions posed offer a good counterbalance to their scientific ambition and hint at complexity, but these could be further expanded upon to avoid them seeming like mere plot devices. Balance the larger-than-life pronouncements with quieter, more human moments to prevent the characters from becoming caricatures. Emphasize their unique voices and personal stakes, and ensure dialogue contributes to character development and narrative tension. МОЙ НЕЗАВЕРШЕННЫЙ СЦЕНАРИЙ: PAGE 1 OF 150 (REDUCED): FADE IN: EXT.

END OF PAGE 30 OF 150","completion":"As an AI language model, I’ll provide feedback regarding the dialogue and style presented in the script excerpts you've provided. My critique will focus on the clarity of dialogue, character voice consistency, and the effectiveness of dialogue in moving the story forward. Due to the extensive narrative provided, I will offer general observations and suggestions. Overall Observations: - Your script effectively conveys a sense of urgency and the gravity of the situation facing the protagonists, Ed and Maria. The high stakes are clear, and the threat of the zombie infestation is imminent. - The intimate moments between Ed and Maria are well-captured, providing a personal touch to the narrative and offering a contrast to the chaos surrounding them. - The script makes successful use of visual and auditory descriptors, which helps to create a rich, cinematic atmosphere. This is particularly effective in scenes of action and tension. General Feedback on Dialogue: - The dialogue between Ed and Maria does a good job of expressing their emotional bond and shared sense of responsibility. It consistently emphasizes their partnership both in their personal lives and professional work. - The conversations surrounding the ethical implications of their scientific work are crucial and well-placed. They help to ground the science fiction elements in reality and give the characters depth. - There are moments where the dialogue feels a bit on the nose or expository. Consider adding more subtext or allowing the characters’ actions to convey meaning without directly stating it. - At times, the dialogue tends toward the melodramatic. To enhance realism and maintain audience engagement, you could introduce more varied speech patterns and a touch of subtlety. - The frequent declarations of love and unity, while emphasizing the characters’ bond, might benefit from being more spread out and delivered in moments that don’t interrupt the pacing of the plot. Suggestions for Improvement: - To maintain narrative momentum, balance the moments of quiet introspection with action. Ensure that the dialogue propels the story forward and doesn’t stall the pace. - The dialogue during moments of scientific explanation could be broken up with reactions from other characters or actions taking place in the lab, adding a dynamic element to these scenes. - Character voice consistency can be strengthened by giving each individual a more distinctive manner of speaking. This can be achieved by considering their background, personality, and status within the story. - Introduce more conflict or debate in scenes that discuss the ethically gray areas of the characters' work. This could add tension and provide opportunities for character development. - As the narrative progresses and the situation becomes more dire, reflect the characters’ growing desperation and resolve in their dialogue, making sure it matches the tone of the scenes. Your approach to screenwriting shows promise, with high emotional stakes and a strong thematic backbone. By refining the dialogue and focusing on the rhythm of the narrative, your script has the potential to resonate strongly with an audience."},{"prompt":"Context constant: here is the code we're working with : import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from torchtext.data.utils import get_tokenizer from torchtext.vocab import build_vocab_from_iterator import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from tqdm import tqdm # Define the Expert module class Expert(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim): super(Expert, self).__init__() self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim) self.activation = nn.ReLU() self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, input_dim) def forward(self, x): x = self.activation(self.fc1(x)) x = self.fc2(x) return x # Define the MoELayer module class MoELayer(nn.Module): def __init__(self, num_experts, input_dim, hidden_dim): super(MoELayer, self).__init__() self.experts = nn.ModuleList([Expert(input_dim, hidden_dim) for _ in range(num_experts)]) self.gate = nn.Linear(input_dim, num_experts) def forward(self, x): gating_distribution = F.softmax(self.gate(x), dim=1) expert_outputs = torch.stack([expert(x) for expert in self.experts], dim=1) output = torch.einsum('bi,bij->bj', gating_distribution, expert_outputs) # This efficiently computes the weighted sum of expert outputs return output # Define the SelectionMechanism module class SelectionMechanism(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, state_dim): super(SelectionMechanism, self).__init__() self.selection_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim + state_dim, state_dim) def forward(self, state, u): # Ensure both state and u have a batch dimension (state already has it) combined = torch.cat((state, u), dim=1) new_state = self.selection_layer(combined) return new_state # Define the StateSpaceMamba module class StateSpaceMamba(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, state_dim, num_experts, hidden_dim): super(StateSpaceMamba, self).__init__() self.state_dim = state_dim self.state = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, state_dim)) self.input_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim, state_dim) self.selection_mechanism = SelectionMechanism(input_dim, state_dim) self.moe_layer = MoELayer(num_experts, state_dim, hidden_dim) def forward(self, input_sequence): outputs = [] state = self.state for u in input_sequence.split(1, dim=0): # Assuming input_sequence is shape (sequence_length, input_dim) u = u.squeeze(0) # Remove the sequence dimension state = self.selection_mechanism(state, u.unsqueeze(0)) # Add batch dimension to u u_projected = self.input_layer(u) output = self.moe_layer(u_projected + state) outputs.append(output) return torch.stack(outputs, dim=0) # Reshape to (sequence_length, input_dim) # Load the dataset print(\\"Loading dataset...\\") with open(\\"C:/Users/Dell-PC/Desktop/The-Physics-Dataset.txt\\", \\"r\\") as f: text = f.read() # Tokenize the text print(\\"Tokenizing text...\\") tokenizer = get_tokenizer(\\"basic_english\\") tokens = tokenizer(text.lower()) # Build the vocabulary print(\\"Building vocabulary...\\") vocab = build_vocab_from_iterator([tokens], specials=[\\"<unk>\\", \\"<pad>\\", \\"<sos>\\", \\"<eos>\\"]) vocab.set_default_index(vocab[\\"<unk>\\"]) numericalized_tokens = [vocab[\\"<sos>\\"]] + [vocab[token] for token in tokens] + [vocab[\\"<eos>\\"]] # Prepare the input sequence batch_size = 24 seq_length = 12 vocab_size = len(vocab) num_batches = len(numericalized_tokens) // (batch_size * seq_length) if len(numericalized_tokens) < (batch_size * seq_length): raise ValueError(f\\"Dataset is too small for the chosen batch size and sequence length.

Definition of models: - \`Expert\`: A feedforward neural network module used as a building block for the mixture of experts. - \`MoELayer\`: A mixture of experts layer module, which combines several \`Expert\` modules with a gating mechanism. - \`SelectionMechanism\`: A simple neural network that updates a state vector based on input. - \`StateSpaceMamba\`: A stateful model that uses the \`SelectionMechanism\` and \`MoELayer\` to process sequences of data. 2. Loading and preprocessing a dataset: - You load a text file and tokenize the text using \`torchtext\`'s utilities. - A vocabulary is built from the tokens, and the text is numericalized. - The numericalized tokens are shaped into a batched input sequence suitable for processing by the model. 3. Training loop: - A training function (\`train\`) is defined to train the \`StateSpaceMamba\` model using the preprocessed data. - The training function uses the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss to update the model. 4. Text generation: - A function (\`generate\`) to generate text from the model. Here's a general review of each section: # Expert, MoELayer, SelectionMechanism, and StateSpaceMamba Classes: - The definition of these classes looks structurally sound. Each of these classes inherits from \`nn.Module\`, which is the usual practice when defining neural network models or components in PyTorch. - The \`forward\` methods appear to implement the intended computations correctly. - One note to consider is that the \`state\` parameter in \`StateSpaceMamba\` is defined as a single vector (nn.Parameter) initialized to zeros. This implies that you are initializing the state with zeros for all sequences. If you want to maintain separate states for different batches or sequences, you should adjust the state initialization to account for different batch sizes. # Loading the Dataset: - The code for loading a text dataset, tokenizing, and building a vocabulary seems fine. Note that it would be advisable to add error handling in case the file doesn't exist or can't be opened. # Training Loop: - In the train function, it is important to note you only backpropagate through the network for the \`seq_length\` number of steps (due to splitting the data with that length). This should be fine as long as you understand the implications for temporal dependencies that stretch further than \`seq_length\`. - Before training starts, the code doesn't split the data into separate training and validation sets, which is typically done to evaluate model performance on unseen data. # Text Generation: - The generate function appears to handle text generation correctly by sampling from the output probabilities. Note that it uses a temperature parameter to adjust the probability distribution used when sampling, which allows you to control the randomness/diversity of the output. - It is important to remember that the torch.multinomial function can return different results each time the function is called due to its stochastic nature. # General Considerations: - Remember to check for any issues related to device placement (CPU vs. GPU). This code assumes everything is on the CPU, which may not be what you want for larger-scale training. - The use of \`print\` statements for logging during training is a good practice for keeping track of progress, but for more complex scenarios, you may want to employ more sophisticated logging tools that can track more metrics and provide better visualization. - The code doesn't explicitly handle any potential issues with random seeds, which can affect reproducibility. If you need reproducible results, you should set random seeds for PyTorch and other libraries like Numpy. - Additionally, you have not included any code to save the trained model or its parameters, which you would typically want to do after training so that you can reuse the trained model later without having to retrain it from scratch. Please ensure that you have appropriate error handling, validation, and reproducibility practices in place when you run this code."},{"prompt":"I get the following error trying to train a model : Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaMoE-Mamba.py\\", line 140, in <module> loss_history = train(model, input_sequence, num_batches, batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size, epochs) File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaMoE-Mamba.py\\", line 127, in train outputs = model(inputs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1518, in _wrapped_call_impl return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1527, in _call_impl return forward_call(*args, **kwargs) File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaMoE-Mamba.py\\", line 64, in forward state = self.selection_mechanism(state, u.unsqueeze(0)) # Add batch dimension to u File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1518, in _wrapped_call_impl return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1527, in _call_impl return forward_call(*args, **kwargs) File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaMoE-Mamba.py\\", line 45, in forward new_state = self.selection_layer(combined) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1518, in _wrapped_call_impl return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 1527, in _call_impl return forward_call(*args, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchnnmoduleslinear.py\\", line 114, in forward return F.linear(input, self.weight, self.bias) RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (1x268 and 682x256)","completion":"The error message \`RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (1x268 and 682x256)\` suggests an issue with matrix multiplication incompatibility within your \`SelectionMechanism\`'s \`forward\` function. Specifically, it indicates that you are trying to multiply two matrices with incompatible shapes: the first matrix (mat1) has a shape of 1x268, and the second (mat2) has a shape of 682x256. Matrix multiplication requires that the number of columns in the first matrix (mat1) must match the number of rows in the second matrix (mat2). Looking at the module definition for \`SelectionMechanism\`: \`\`\`python class SelectionMechanism(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, state_dim): super(SelectionMechanism, self).__init__() self.selection_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim + state_dim, state_dim) # Linear layer expects input of combined size \`\`\` And its forward function: \`\`\`python def forward(self, state, u): # Ensure both state and u have a batch dimension (state already has it) combined = torch.cat((state, u), dim=1) new_state = self.selection_layer(combined) return new_state \`\`\` It seems that the combination of \`state\` and \`u\` should yield a tensor of shape \`[batch_size, input_dim + state_dim]\` before it is passed to the \`selection_layer\`, which is defined to expect input of size \`input_dim + state_dim\`. The issue likely originates from the sizes of \`state\` and/or \`u\` not matching the expected dimensions for the \`selection_layer\`. Please check the following: 1. Confirm that the \`state\` tensor has the appropriate shape \`[batch_size, state_dim]\`. 2. Make sure that \`u\` has the shape \`[batch_size, input_dim]\` before concatenation. Here's a checklist to diagnose and remedy the issue: - Inspect the shapes of \`state\` and \`u\` immediately before concatenation. Add print statements such as \`print(state.shape)\` and \`print(u.shape)\` if necessary. - Confirm that the \`input_dim\` specified in the \`SelectionMechanism\` constructor matches the actual input dimension you are providing to the forward method. - Check the initialization of the state in the \`StateSpaceMamba\` module. The \`state\` should probably be initialized considering the batch size, or reshaped appropriately before being used in the forward steps. Otherwise, the mismatch will persist since the \`state\` being used is a fixed size of \`[1, state_dim]\`. To fix the state initialization issue, consider removing the \`nn.Parameter\` from the \`StateSpaceMamba\` and initializing the \`state\` within the forward method itself, ensuring to account for the correct batch size: \`\`\`python class StateSpaceMamba(nn.Module): # ... other methods ... def forward(self, input_sequence): batch_size = input_sequence.size(0) # Assuming the input is [batch_size, seq_length, input_dim] outputs = [] state = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.state_dim).to(input_sequence.device) # Initialize state for the current batch # ... rest of the forward method ... \`\`\` If the \`input_sequence\` tensor is not shaped correctly [batch_size, seq_length, input_dim], you'll need to adjust your preprocessing to ensure this shape is achieved before training."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security: Dear one, I 'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under the co-operation of a new partner from JAPAN.

Develop a detailed outline for chapters 11 through the Midpoint, progressing to chapter 23, the epilogue. Structure the outline using bullet points, ensuring each chapter includes 2-3 scenes narrated from the perspectives of Rhaenyra, Nyra, or Daemion. As Rhaenyra is protagonist, give more narrative time to her (main plotline). Your outline should reflect the following character developments and plot guidelines: 1. For chapters 11-13, depict Rhaenyra opting for the simplest and least effortful solutions to her challenges. Don’t use magic as Rhaenyra is not a mage, suggest sociopolitical and psychological decisions. Her approach should culminate in a significant setback at the Midpoint, symbolized by the loss of a safe haven. 2. In chapters 13-20, intensify the stakes, pace, and Rhaenyra’s motivation. Highlight her growth from the repercussions of her earlier choices. 3. Post-Midpoint, illustrate Rhaenyra’s realization of her precarious predicament and her exploration of more unsavory or morally grey strategies (using poison, thugs, assassins, mercenaries) to ensure her future survival. 4. The war hasn’t started it, the plot shows subtle attempts to eliminate rivals before king’s death. Weave the new chapters coherently with the established lore, character progression, and story threads, guiding the narrative toward the envisioned ending. Ensure continuity from the pre-existing material and contribute to the story’s enhancement. Include detailed suggestions for plot twists, character evolution, and thematic depth to enrich the reader’s journey. Focus on clear event sequences, character dynamics, and climactic moments in the outline, and remember to: - Maintain narrative consistency - Highlight turning points and character development - Emphasize thematic argument The aim is to craft a compelling creative extension of the story that aligns with the initial vision and adds depth to the characters and narrative. <backstory> <premise> On the verge of her king-father’s Viserys I passing, the crown princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (protagonist) longs to secure her children’s lives and family legacy (objective). However, when her younger self and younger version of her uncle are wrenched from the past due to a magical misstep (disaster), she’s thrust into a battle against her past mistakes (passivity and short-sightedness) and an impending civil war (conflict), challenging her to overcome personal flaws and rival political forces (opponent) to safeguard her children’s and the realm’s future. </premise> Genre: high fantasy plus family drama. <thematic argument> In order to survive and secure their family’s future in the game of thrones, one must actively engage and confront their rival factions. </thematic argument> <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. iv. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. v. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. vi. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. vii. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. viii. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. ix. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. x. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. xi. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xii. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xiii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiv. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xv. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvi. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> <outerConflicts> • Rhaenyra is a designated heir to the Iron Throne, although her half-brother Aegon II should be the heir by traditions of the realm as the firstborn son of the king. Otto Hightower schemes to put Aegon II on the throne but Rhaenyra doesn’t know about it. • Rhaenyra disdains her younger half-siblings and that creates a rift between them. • Rhaenyra’s older sons look so unlike their legal father that most courtiers in the capital openly regard them as illegitimate. Seeking a meaningful relationship, she chose a man she could trust and love (Harwin). However, her older sons' appearance indicates their illegitimacy. • Rhaenyra left the capital six years ago, avoiding rumors about her older sons’ bastardy, therefore, she lost influence and allies at the court. • Rhaenyra’s younger brother Aemond lost his eye in the fight with Luke and he holds a huge grudge against him and her. • Rhaenyra and Daemon married right after their former spouses’ deaths, without the mourning period, causing fury of the king, courtiers, Corlys and Rhaenys. • Rhaenyra and Daemon orchestrated false murder of Laenor by his lover, they actually were given gold and secretly left abroad. It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. • Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement. • Rhaenyra is generally happy with Daemon, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. • Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. • Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. • During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. </outerConflicts> </outline> Prologue – The Omen: Scene 0.1 - Setting: Castle-bound ship at night - Characters: Prince Luke (POV), Crown Princess Rhaenyra, siblings of Luke - Events: Prince Lucerys “Luke” Velaryon, scorned for his divergence from the pure Valyrian features, embarks on a forbidden quest to alter his blood and appearance through ancient blood magic hidden within a stolen tome.

Как не пробовал не удалось найти как её можно обесцветить в домашних условиях. Ну ято бы она потускнела.","completion":"Привет! Ткань Oxford, как и многие другие синтетические или смешанные ткани, может быть устойчива к некоторым видам химического воздействия, что делает процесс обесцвечивания сложным. Важно, что при любых попытках обесцветить ткань есть риск повреждения материала, изменения его структуры или текстуры. Если вы все же хотите попробовать обесцветить ткань Oxford, чтобы сделать ее менее яркой, вот несколько способов, которые можно использовать дома: 1. **Применение отбеливателя для тканей**: Если ткань допускает использование отбеливателя (проверьте ярлык с инструкциями по уходу), вы можете попробовать аккуратно обработать ее слабым раствором хлорного или безхлорного отбеливателя. 2. **Использование разбавленной перекиси водорода**: Разбавьте перекись водорода водой (например, 1 часть перекиси на 10 частей воды) и попробуйте промокнуть или замочить ткань на короткое время, следя за результатом. 3. **Замачивание в воде с добавлением уксуса или лимонного сока**: Эти натуральные кислоты могут слегка осветлить некоторые красители, но влияние будет относительно слабым. Используйте 1 часть уксуса или лимонного сока на 10 частей воды. 4. **Использование средств для выведения краски**: В некоторых случаях специальные средства для выведения краски, которые можно купить в магазине товаров для шитья или в интернете, могут помочь уменьшить интенсивность цвета. Перед тем как приступить к обесцвечиванию, важно сделать следующее: - Проверьте этикетку на ткани для получения инструкций по уходу и убедитесь, что ткань можно обрабатывать отбеливателями или другими химикатами. - Протестируйте любой выбранный способ на небольшом, незаметном участке ткани, чтобы увидеть, как она реагирует. - Носите защитные перчатки и работайте в хорошо проветриваемом помещении при использовании отбеливателей или химикатов. - Следуйте инструкциям и не держите ткань в растворе дольше рекомендованного времени, чтобы избежать повреждения волокон. И помните, что обесцвечивание ткани — это часто необратимый процесс, который может привести к неожиданным результатам, таким как пятна или неравномерность цвета, поэтому всегда рассматривайте это как последний вариант."},{"prompt":"Во втором способе грубо говоря на 10 л воды, литр переписи?","completion":"Извините за путаницу. Обычно используются более слабые концентрации перекиси водорода для обесцвечивания тканей. Для начала вы можете попробовать использовать концентрацию перекиси водорода на уровне 3%, которая является стандартной для аптечной перекиси. В таком случае на 10 литров воды можно добавить лишь небольшое количество перекиси — примерно столовую или две ложки. Это около 30-60 мл перекиси. Начните с небольшого количества и всегда тестируйте раствор на маленьком кусочке ткани или на незаметном участке, чтобы увидеть, как ваша конкретная ткань реагирует на обработку. Если результат вас устраивает, вы можете приступать к обработке всего куска ткани, но продолжайте внимательно следить за процессом, чтобы не переборщить и не повредить ткань."},{"prompt":"Лучше тогда на 1 л тип рассчитан пропорции тау удобнее считать будет","completion":"Конечно, вы можете рассчитать пропорции на 1 литр воды для удобства. Если брать 3%-ную перекись водорода, то можно добавить приблизительно 10 мл (около двух чайных ложек) перекиси на литр воды. Это даст вам слабый раствор, который можно использовать для обесцвечивания ткани. Вот шаги, которые можно предпринять: 1. Налейте в подходящую ёмкость 1 литр чистой тёплой воды. 2. Добавьте 10 мл (2 чайные ложки) перекиси водорода 3%. 3. Перемешайте раствор, чтобы перекись хорошо распределилась в воде. 4. Поместите небольшой кусочек ткани в раствор, чтобы проверить его действие. Рекомендуется оставить ткань в растворе на небольшой промежуток времени, например, на 10-15 минут, а затем проверить результат. Если уровень обесцвечивания вас устраивает, можно продолжить обработку. Если цвет не изменился, можно увеличить концентрацию перекиси водорода в растворе или дать ему больше времени для воздействия. Не забудьте после обработки хорошо прополоскать ткань в чистой воде для удаления остатков перекиси водорода. Помните, что перекись водорода может оказывать разное воздействие на разные красители и ткани, поэтому всегда начинайте с теста на небольшом участке и будьте очень осторожны, чтобы не повредить материал."},{"prompt":"Как думаешь может ли раствор переписи на ткань Оксфорд повлиять?","completion":"Перекись водорода может оказывать воздействие на различные типы тканей и красителей, включая ткань \\"Оксфорд\\". Она, как правило, изготавливается из полиэстера или полиамидных волокон, хотя иногда может включать хлопок или их смеси. Синтетические волокна, такие как полиэстер, отличаются высокой стойкостью к химическим воздействиям, поэтому перекись водорода может не оказать значительного эффекта обесцвечивания или же его влияние будет слабым. Тем не менее, в определенных условиях и при достаточной концентрации или продолжительности воздействия раствор перекиси водорода может слегка осветлить ткань \\"Оксфорд\\" или изменить её оттенок. Вот что важно учитывать: 1. **Тестирование на небольшом участке**: Обязательно проведите тест на маленьком, незаметном кусочке ткани, чтобы увидеть, как реагирует цвет и материал. 2. **Умеренное использование**: Начинайте с более слабых растворов и коротких промежутков времени, чтобы избежать нежелательного повреждения ткани. 3. **Различия в реакции**: Ткань \\"Оксфорд\\", окрашенная разными красителями или с разным составом волокон, может по-разному реагировать на перекись водорода. 4. **Контроль процесса**: Внимательно следите за процессом и при первых признаках достижения желаемого эффекта или при появлении каких-либо признаков повреждения ткани немедленно прекращайте обработку. 5. **Полоскание**: После обработки перекисью тщательно промойте ткань в чистой воде. Как уже упоминалось, не все ткани и красители поддаются обесцвечиванию, и существует вероятность неравномерного или непредсказуемого результата. Также следует помнить, что перекись водорода чаще всего используется для отбеливания натуральных тканей, таких как хлопок, и её действие на синтетические материалы может быть не таким эффективным или предсказуемым."},{"prompt":"hello everyone","completion":"Hello!

ВАШ ОТВЕТ НА ЗАПРОС ДОЛЖЕН НАПИСАТЬСЯ ВОТ ТАК: As an AI language model, I’ll provide feedback regarding the dialogue and style presented on each page you’ve provided. My critique will particularly focus on the clarity of the dialogue, character voice consistency, and the effectiveness of dialogue in moving the story forward. Page 1: - The dialogue “Science today gives shape to tomorrow’s reality. Let’s push boundaries.” is thematic and sets the tone effectively for a science-driven narrative. It succinctly communicates Ed’s venture into groundbreaking territory. - Maria’s toast conveys both the romantic and the professional partnership between her and Ed. Page 2: - Ed’s monologue (“The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented.“) further cements his dedication to his work, but may border on telling rather than showing. Consider balancing with more visual cues. - “This could be it, the key to life eternal.” Maria’s dialogue captures the scope of their discoveries but may benefit from a more nuanced or personal touch as it feels a bit generic. Page 3: - Ed’s and Maria’s dialogue continues to successfully echo the grandeur of their scientific endeavor but verges on the didactic. Injecting a hint of personal stakes or vulnerability could add depth. - The ethics question from the audience is an excellent inclusion to prompt discourse on the implications of their work, but Ed’s response seems somewhat dismissive. Expanding this could exhibit conflict and complexity. Page 4: - Ed’s declaration (“To the miracle of you, the REAL discovery of my life.”) beautifully intertwines personal and professional spheres, providing a moment of vulnerability. It balances the intensity of their work with their private life. - Maria’s dialogue to be just “us—no titles, no future…” appropriately introduces a sense of foreboding and humanizes the characters further. Page 5: - While not traditional dialogue, Ed’s phone speech is pivotal to building tension. The urgency is palpable, but it’s critical that this doesn’t feel too abrupt within the story pacing. - “GET TO THE LAB! Now!” - Effective in its urgency, although it could be more engaging if we heard a brief panicked exchange with the other end to raise the stakes. Page 6-7: - Ed’s rallying call to make history touches on his leadership but risks sounding clichéd. Consider how his character may uniquely motivate the team. - Maria’s reaction to cell regeneration (“Eternal life’s in reach, Ed. It’s miraculous.”) provides contrast between scientific excitement and potential ethical concerns, making it a moment of intrigue. Page 8: - Maria and Dr. Kim’s interaction feels authentic and insightful, bringing in an outsider’s admiration while also hinting at potential consequences. It’s good to see acknowledgment from a respected peer, but further developing Dr. Kim’s perspective could be beneficial. - The assistants’ interjection illustrates story progression effectively, giving a sense of looming spectacle. Page 9: - Ed’s speech is very on the nose. It’s important to differentiate between what is intended as moving and inspirational, and what might sound overly dramatized. - Dr. Kim’s reaction adds to the credibility of the scene, grounding Ed’s grandeur. Page 10: - Ed’s enthusiasm in “Behold PHOENIX…” is palpable. It successfully showcases the grand reveal but risks being too theatrical. Balancing with some practical exposition could be more engaging. - “To the dawn of a new world unbowed by time!” can be striking, but also ventures toward melodrama. Consider breaking up the larger speeches into more digestible and natural-sounding components. Page 11: - The ethical dialogue is a great addition, allowing room for conflict and moral dilemmas. Ed’s reassurance “We’re working hand in glove with POLICYMAKERS…” seems somewhat pat; expanding this with a hint of underlying tension or doubt could add complexity. Page 12-13: - Maria’s words (“Today was extraordinary…”) reveal her internal conflict, indicating the foreshadowing of potential issues. This moment of introspection is valuable for her character development. - The Chancellor’s commendation juxtaposed with Rosenberg and Sharpe’s private debate enhances the narrative by presenting public praise against private concerns. Page 14-15: - Ed and Maria’s interactions are filled with romantic and thematic elements. While it’s important to convey their bond, be careful of repetitious themes (\\"The decisions we’ve made… they’ll define us, Ed.” has been echoed previously) and strive for dialogue that also advances plot or character. Page 16-17: - The dialogue captures their personal connection, but their constant repetition of commitment and unity can wear thin. It is clear that they are a united front; additional dimensions to their relationship could be more revealing. - The passion scenes walk a fine line between intense romance and cliché. Strike a balance to ensure the narrative’s momentum isn’t lost. Page 18-20: - As panic sets in, the urgency is felt through the dialogue. Ed’s brief words on the phone effectively set the wheels in motion for the characters’ response to the crisis. The inclusion of the rat amidst the passion serenely questions the cost of their deeds. Overall, the dialogue carries strong thematic elements and the shared vision between Ed and Maria is crystal clear, emphasizing their partnership and dedication to their work. However, there are moments where the dialogue veers towards melodrama or feels redundant. The ethical questions posed offer a good counterbalance to their scientific ambition and hint at complexity, but these could be further expanded upon to avoid them seeming like mere plot devices. Balance the larger-than-life pronouncements with quieter, more human moments to prevent the characters from becoming caricatures. Emphasize their unique voices and personal stakes, and ensure dialogue contributes to character development and narrative tension. МОЙ НЕЗАВЕРШЕННЫЙ СЦЕНАРИЙ: PAGE 1 OF 150 (REDUCED): FADE IN: EXT.

ED steps in front of her, positioning himself as a BARRIER between MARIA and the HORDE. It’s SCIENCE versus SURVIVAL now. MARIA begins to back away, but the zombies are swift, INEXORABLY drawn to the living. ED and MARIA retreat, the tension PALPABLE. But a SINGLE zombie BREAKS from the group, LUNGING with OPEN jaws. ED (fighting back, his voice laced with ADRENALINE) Maria, move! MARIA rushes forward, pushing ED, but the ZOMBIE’s teeth CLAMP down on his arm—a PAIN that SPEAKS of an irreversible CHANGE. MARIA screams, her echoing CRY filled with PRIMAL fear, the realization of NIGHTMARES becoming REALITY. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS Gasping for AIR, they stagger into the room, barricading themselves against the onslaught. ED GASPS, PAIN written all over his face as he clutches the gory WOUND. MARIA, eyes WIDE with TERROR, instinctively reaches out, her touch both COMFORTING and FRAUGHT with desperation. MARIA (sobs choking her words) We can STOP the bleeding… There’s still TIME. ED’s breath comes in ragged HUFFS; his skin GROWS pale, the VENOM of his new reality spreading through his VEINS. ED (straining to SPEAK) Maria… you have to GO… Find the ANTIDOTE… MARIA collapses against him, her WORLD faltering. The PAIN of facing what comes next—a future FILLED with ANGST and relentless PURSUIT—crushes down upon her. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 28 OF 150 PAGE 29 OF 150 (REDUCED): INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Urgency fills the LAB as MARIA, relentless, RIFLES through vials. ED, his skin GRAYING, lies motionless on a steel table, the life within him ebbing. With hands trembling, MARIA grasps a SYRINGE, the label reads “EXPERIMENTAL ANTIDOTE.” In her eyes, a silent PRAYER to whatever gods may listen. MARIA (with conviction) Hold on, Ed. This could be our ONLY chance! She injects the substance into Ed’s veins. Their eyes meet, a dance of HOPE and FEAR. Suddenly, Ed’s body jerks—an alarming CONVULSION. Maria whispers ENCOURAGEMENTS, her voice a LIFELINE in the storm. ED (gritting his teeth, voice STRAINED but hopeful) It’s… working. Keep pressing, Maria. A moment of calm, then CHAOS erupts as the undead BREACH the door—GROANS and mangled cries FILL the room. MARIA, with newfound strength, WIELDS a fire extinguisher, a SHIELD against the advancing HORROR. They edge toward the door, SURVIVAL their ONLY thought. ED (screaming above the noise) Maria, LEAVE NOW! In a desperate act, MARIA pushes Ed forward, but as FATE would have it, the swarm ensnares him. With SHEER will, he throws her out the escape hatch, SEALING his fate within. MARIA (anguished as she pounds the door) ED, I can’t… I WON’T leave you! Her cries mix with the fading tumult inside. As the door LOCKS, the silence is DEAFENING. MARIA (tears streaming, a new resolve CRYSTALLIZING) I’ll END this, Ed. For US. For EVERYONE. The HELICOPTER awaits, its engine WHIRLING, a beacon amidst the despair. Maria’s courage is her COMPANION as the blades slice the air, carrying her toward her next battle. CUT TO BLACK. PAGE 30 OF 150 (REDUCED): EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a CACOPHONY of TERROR. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin DEATHLY PALE, veins BLACKENING. With the shadow of ZOMBIFICATION drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (fierce, urging) Go, Maria… SAVE the world… our kids. With a mix of HORROR and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an UNNATURAL FEROCITY only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and RESILIENCE of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a MONSTER, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an INSATIABLE need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children FUELLING his every step. MARIA, atop the HELIPAD, is torn between following ED and escaping with the CURE. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (crying out with pain and resolve) I love you… I’ll FIND them, Ed. I PROMISE! With the cries of her husband ECHOING in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their FIGHT and SAVE the city they LOVE. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a LONE figure of tragedy amidst the DEVASTATION. The HELICOPTER, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential CURE to her CHEST as they ascend into the MAELSTROM. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENESIS LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to FOCUS, Maria enters the lab again. The screen FLICKERS to life, INTERFACING with her fierce intellect. She SYNTHESIZES, refines, and tests with the TENACITY of a woman reborn from the ashes of her old life. MARIA (whispering fiercely) For Ed, for our children… for EVERYONE. Her hands never waver, her eyes never STRAY. The readouts WINK back at her with PROMISING data, and the COMPOUND finally takes form—a vial shining with the HOPE of HUMANITY. MARIA (declaring against the sounds of CHAOS) This is the BEGINNING. Run Zombie, RUN!

Мой отзыв будет особенно сосредоточен на ясности диалогов, последовательности голоса персонажей и эффективности диалога в продвижении сюжета вперед. Страница 1: - Диалог \\"Наука сегодня формирует завтрашнюю реальность. Давайте пересмотрим границы.\\" тематичен и эффективно задает тон научно-ориентированному повествованию. Он лаконично передает стремление Эда к прорывной территории. Страница 2: - Монолог Эда (\\"Прорыв, над которым мы работаем... это беспрецедентно.\\") дополнительно закрепляет его преданность своему делу. Стоит сбалансировать это с более визуальными подсказками. Страница 3: - Диалог Эда продолжает успешно отражать его амбиции, но имеет тенденцию быть слишком дидактичным. Включение личных ставок или уязвимости могло бы добавить глубину. Страница 4: - Замечание Эда о Марии (\\"Чудо тебя, настоящее открытие моей жизни.\\") красиво объединяет профессиональную и личную сферы, обеспечивая момент уязвимости. Страницы 5-7: - Разговор между Эдом и Марией находится в напряженной обстановке, и они оба подчеркивают их совместные цели. Однако моменты, когда диалог переходит в мелодраму или кажется избыточным, требуют дополнительной проработки. Страницы 8-10: - Эд даёт много обещаний о будущем и прелестях их открытия, но его слова могут быть восприняты как банальные. Важно обеспечить естественное и разнообразное изложение мыслей персонажа. Страницы 11-13: - Этические вопросы, поднятые в диалогах, позволяют создать хороший контрапункт к научным амбициям Эда и Марии. Однако, возможно, стоит более детально разработать эти аспекты. Страницы 14-17: - Взаимодействие Эда и Марии показывает их личные и научные устремления. Однако постоянное повторение темы единства может утомить зрителей. Страницы 18-20: - Как только начинается паника, срочность ощущается через диалог. Эд и Мария действуют быстро, чтобы ответить на кризис, что эффективно для развития сюжета. В целом, диалоги несут сильные тематические элементы, и общее видение между Эдом и Марией ясно подчеркивает их партнерство и преданность своему делу. Однако есть моменты, когда диалог склонен к мелодраме или кажется повторяющимся. Поднятые этические вопросы предлагают хорошую противовесность их научным амбициям и намекают на сложность, но эти могут быть дальше разработаны, чтобы не казаться лишь устройствами для сюжета. Баланс между заявлениями, полными решимости, и тишиной, более похожей на человеческие моменты, поможет не дать персонажам превратиться в карикатуры. Усилите их уникальные голоса и личные ставки и гарантируйте, что диалог способствует развитию персонажа и напряжению в повествовании."},{"prompt":"Страница 21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30","completion":"Как языковая модель, я сосредоточусь на предоставлении обратной связи по каждой из представленных страниц.

The aim here will be to maintain a lighthearted and entertaining tone while exploring the vast history of Tamriel. Let's embark on this epic and whimsical journey through the ages: --- In the bountiful and bewildering realm of Tamriel, the history books are penned with the ink of chaos and bound in the leather of absurdity. From gods who pulled the ultimate DIY on the universe, assembling the world with the enthusiasm of kids playing with cosmic LEGO bricks, to mortals who looked at dragons and thought, \\"Eh, we can take 'em,\\" Tamrelian history is nothing short of a fantastical fever dream. The tapestry of time begins in a period historians fondly refer to as \\"When Stuff Got Started,\\" or formally, the Merethic Era. Back then, the Aedra and Daedra were just setting up the décor, arguing whether Molag Bal's obsession with chains was avant-garde or just tacky. Meanwhile, the elves popped up, thinking they owned the place, only to discover that the pesky humans had RSVP’d to the creation party too. Then came the First Era – a time of empires built and crumbled like the world's most intense game of Jenga. The Ayleids, with their penchant for shiny, glowing stones, got a bit too enthusiastic with their human 'volunteers' until Alessia decided to serve up a slice of revolution. Boom! Empire number one, courtesy of some hardcore divine bargaining and dragonfire. But, as with all good things, someone yanked the carpet from under it, and that empire fell like a Nord after one too many meads. Speaking of Nords, let's not forget the time when Ysgramor and his 500 merry axemen thought, \\"Why not invade a whole continent because some elves were mean to us?\\" The results? The classic atrocity-filled tale of Nord heroism and questionable colonization ethics. And oh, the Dwemer—Tamriel's own vanished brainiacs—asked, \\"What if we make a giant robot?\\" And so they did, then poof! They mysteriously ghosted the world like a bad first date. Probably shouldn’t have stolen toys from the divine sandbox, eh? Now, if you thought the First Era was a rollercoaster, hold onto your sweetrolls, because the Second Era was truly a 'hold-my-jug-of-Ale' epoch. We had the Akaviri invasion, where snake-people showed up uninvited, got their scales kicked, then everyone shrugged and said, \\"Let’s make the survivor a Potentate!\\" (Hint: It didn't end well.) And let's have a slow clap for Tiber Septim, who came out of nowhere, Warfriended everyone's faces off with his giant stompy Numidium, and declared, \\"I’ll take one continent, united, hold the elves.\\" Thus, the Third Era kicked off with Empire 2: Septim Boogaloo. But the real spice wasn't the empires; it was the antics of the Daedric Princes. Want to throw a plague because it’s a Tuesday? Sure! Swap babies with a king for giggles? Why not! Oh, and let's absolutely invade Tamriel because nirnroot told us to. The Third Era's end was a special kind of crazy. The Oblivion Crisis was like every Daedric Prince's birthday party at once, but all the guests were Dremora, and all they brought were destruction and fire. Luckily, Martin Septim thought it'd be brilliant to turn into a dragon god and 'Big Bang' Mehrunes Dagon back to his corner of oblivion. And thus concluded the Third Era, not with a whimper, but a draconic fire sword statement. Cue the Fourth Era, where things got, dare we say, even spicier. Red Mountain was all \\"Watch me dab so hard it erases a culture,\\" and Summerset Isles were like, \\"We're Altmer, and we'll fix this—oops, we're fascists now.\\" Human-elf relations were going great, as usual. Then arrived the World Eater, Alduin, ready to nom the world into nonexistence. But he didn't count on the Last Dragonborn, or as he's known at the mead hall, \\"Dovahkiin, eater of sweetrolls and cheese wheels.\\" After a casual trip to sovngarde and a few shouted words, the dragon threat turned into a dragon-sized trophy. Through pandemonium, invasions, and dragons notwithstanding, Tamriel trudges on. The Psijic Order occasionally peeks in, saying, \\"You're all doing it wrong,\\" before vanishing to their mystery island like brooding teenagers to their rooms. And amid all the chaos and cosmic stakes, the citizens of Tamriel keep on farming, brewing, and ~~stealing sweetrolls~~ living their everyday lives. In the end, Tamriel history is like having a party, but every guest is either a god, a demon, or wants to be emperor. The music's too loud, a dragon ate the DJ, the buffet is on fire, and somehow the whole thing ends up saving the world. And so, with a wink and a nudge, our meme-ified history comes to a close—a tale of empires and mortals, of highs and Daedra-made lows. It's a chronicle of magic and mayhem, where every era is a chapter written on the back of a winged, fire-breathing metaphor for the unbridled, epic lunacy that is the history of Tamriel."},{"prompt":"write a tamriel history be like meme included most of races","completion":"Creating a \\"Tamriel history be like\\" meme with all the races can be quite an entertaining overview, considering the vast and intricate lore of The Elder Scrolls series.

Also, dragons.\\" - Imperials: \\"Let's run an Empire, but make it unstable with a side of political intrigue.\\" - Redguards: \\"We came from another continent and now we're the best swordsmen. Also, we hate magic.\\" - Bretons: \\"We're half-elves, love magic, and our politics are more confusing than Dwemer engineering.\\" **Other Races:** - Khajiit: \\"Skooma, the moons, and a good caravanserai. In that order.\\" - Argonians: \\"We're lizard people who can breathe underwater and literally no one can invade our swamps successfully.\\" - Dwemer (Dwarves): \\"We made robots and mysteriously disappeared. Bet you can't solve that puzzle.\\" **Daedra and Aedra:** - Aedra: \\"We helped create the world, now we're mostly napping.\\" - Daedra: \\"Who wants to make a deal? Influence mortals? Start a cult? We do it all!\\" **Hist Trees (Argonian God-Trees):** - Hist: \\"We pre-date everything and secretly control Argonian life. Just really slowly.\\" **Dragons:** - Dragons: \\"We dominate the skies, but then this one dude learned to yell really loudly.\\" **Tamrielic Empires:** - First Empire of Men: \\"Humans rule! Or at least until we don't.\\" - Alessian Empire: \\"Religion and rebellion, because why not?\\" - Reman Empire: \\"We unified Tamriel, except for those places we didn't.\\" - Septim Empire: \\"One guy conquers the continent, creates an era, and then his descendants drop the ball.\\" **Elder Scrolls (Artifacts):** - Elder Scrolls: \\"We hold the secrets of the universe but good luck reading us without going blind.\\" **And everything else:** - Every five minutes: \\"And another apocalyptic event is happening... again.\\" This comical summary definitely doesn't cover every intricacy of Tamriel's history, but it gives a lighthearted nod to some of the many races and their stereotypes within the lore of The Elder Scrolls series."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Since his death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.

The etiology of AKI can generally be categorized into three major groups: 1. **Prerenal AKI**: This is caused by conditions that reduce systemic circulation leading to decreased renal perfusion without initial intrinsic damage to the kidney tissue. If the cause is not corrected, prerenal AKI can lead to intrinsic damage. Causes include: - Hypovolemia (due to hemorrhage, dehydration, or fluid losses from the gastrointestinal tract) - Decreased cardiac output (due to heart failure, cardiogenic shock) - Systemic vasodilation (due to sepsis, anaphylaxis) - Renal vasoconstriction (due to medications like NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, or calcineurin inhibitors) 2. **Intrinsic AKI**: This is due to direct injury to the kidneys and can affect the glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, or small vessels of the kidney. The most common form of intrinsic AKI is acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Causes include: - Acute tubular necrosis due to ischemia (prolonged prerenal AKI) or nephrotoxic substances (such as aminoglycosides, radiocontrast media, heavy metals, myoglobin from rhabdomyolysis) - Glomerulonephritis - Acute interstitial nephritis, often due to allergic drug reactions or infections - Vasculitis or thrombotic events affecting the kidney microvasculature 3. **Postrenal AKI**: This results from obstruction of urine flow beyond the kidneys, leading to back pressure and kidney injury. If prolonged, it can cause direct intrinsic kidney damage. Causes include: - Ureteral obstruction due to kidney stones, tumors, or clots - Bladder obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy, bladder stones, tumors, or neurogenic bladder - Urethral obstruction due to strictures or phimosis The diagnosis of AKI requires careful clinical assessment, including medical history and physical examination, alongside investigation tools like serum creatinine, urinalysis, and ultrasound when appropriate. Identifying the underlying etiology is crucial for the proper management and treatment of the condition."},{"prompt":"pathophysiology of aki","completion":"The pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) varies depending on the underlying etiology, but it ultimately leads to impairment of kidney function. Here's a glimpse into the pathophysiological processes of AKI, organized by the basic categories mentioned – prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal: # Prerenal AKI 1. **Hypoperfusion**: The kidneys receive about 20% of the cardiac output, and they depend on adequate perfusion to function properly. In situations of hypoperfusion, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases because of reduced hydrostatic pressure in glomerular capillaries. 2. **Autoregulation**: Initially, the kidneys compensate through autoregulatory mechanisms (like afferent arteriolar vasodilation) to maintain GFR. If hypoperfusion continues, these compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed. 3. **Activation of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)**: Persistent hypoperfusion stimulates the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system, which helps maintain blood pressure but can also lead to further vasoconstriction and reduced renal blood flow. 4. **Renal Tubular Effects**: Prolonged prerenal AKI can lead to tubular cell injury due to ischemia, initiating a transition to acute tubular necrosis (intrinsic AKI). # Intrinsic AKI 1. **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**: The most common form of intrinsic AKI, it can occur due to prolonged ischemia or exposure to nephrotoxic agents. It is characterized by damage to the renal tubular epithelial cells, which can slough off and lead to tubular obstruction. 2. **Inflammatory Response**: Many forms of intrinsic AKI involve an inflammatory response, cytokine release, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which can further damage renal tissue. 3. **Glomerular Damage**: Conditions like acute glomerulonephritis can cause inflammation and damage to glomeruli, leading to altered permeability and reduction in the effective filtration surface area. 4. **Interstitial Inflammation**: Acute interstitial nephritis typically results from an allergic reaction to medications. It involves interstitial edema and infiltration of immune cells, which can disrupt renal function. 5. **Vascular Injury**: Microangiopathy and vasculitis can compromise the renal microvasculature, leading to reduced perfusion and ischemic injury to the renal parenchyma. # Postrenal AKI 1. **Obstruction**: Postrenal AKI is due to obstruction of urine flow anywhere from the pelvis of the kidney to the urethral meatus. This leads to increased intraluminal pressure and can progress to hydronephrosis. 2. **Backpressure**: The increased pressure within the urinary collecting system can transmit back to the nephrons, reducing GFR due to increased tubular pressure and compromised filtration. 3. **Tubulointerstitial Effects**: Chronic obstruction can lead to damage to the renal parenchyma due to pressure-induced fibrosis and atrophy. # Common Pathophysiological Themes in AKI: - **Reduced GFR**: This is a central feature of all types of AKI, impairing the kidneys' ability to filter blood. - **Tubular Dysfunction**: Resulting in electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and the inability to concentrate urine. - **Activation of Inflammatory Pathways**: Leading to further kidney injury and systemic effects. - **Cellular Stress and Death**: Hypoxic injury, toxins, or inflammation can induce apoptosis and necrosis of renal cells. A disruption in any part of the kidney's complex functions can have downstream effects, ultimately impairing the filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes that are vital to maintaining the body’s homeostasis.

Some patients may be asymptomatic, particularly in the early stages, and AKI is often first detected by laboratory abnormalities. Symptoms and signs of AKI can include the following: # Symptoms 1. **Oliguria or Anuria**: Reduced urine output is common (< 400 mL of urine per day in oliguria; < 100 mL per day in anuria) but is not present in all cases of AKI. 2. **Fluid Retention**: Patients may report swelling or puffiness, especially of the legs or around the eyes, due to the body retaining more fluid than normal when the kidneys are not filtering effectively. 3. **Fatigue**: Decreased kidney function often leads to a build-up of toxins and impaired electrolyte balance, which can cause general malaise and fatigue. 4. **Shortness of Breath**: Fluid overload may lead to pulmonary edema, causing difficulty breathing. 5. **Nausea and Vomiting**: Accumulation of uremic toxins can irritate the gastrointestinal tract. 6. **Confusion or Decreased Mental Alertness**: Kidney dysfunction leads to accumulation of waste products that can affect brain function. 7. **Chest Pain or Pressure**: This can occur if there is fluid buildup around the heart (pericardial effusion), which can sometimes result in pericarditis in severe uremia. # Signs 1. **Edema**: This can be peripheral (swelling of the ankles, feet, or hands) or may be more generalized, depending on the degree of fluid retention. 2. **Hypertension**: Retention of sodium and water can lead to increased blood pressure. 3. **Uremic Frost**: A rare sign of severe uremia where urea crystallizes on the skin. 4. **Pulmonary Edema**: Indicated by crackles on lung auscultation due to fluid accumulation. 5. **Heart Failure**: Jugular venous distension, third heart sound (S3), and other signs of volume overload may be present. 6. **Uremic Encephalopathy**: Altered mental status can range from slight confusion to deep stupor or coma. 7. **Abnormal Heart and Lung Sounds**: Fluid overload can lead to abnormal findings on a physical examination, including rales in the lungs and a heart murmur if there is associated uremic pericarditis. # Laboratory and Diagnostic Signs 1. **Increased Serum Creatinine and BUN**: These are markers of kidney function and usually rise when GFR declines. 2. **Hyperkalemia**: Decreased excretion of potassium may lead to elevated serum potassium levels. 3. **Metabolic Acidosis**: Reduced excretion of hydrogen ions and production of bicarbonate can lead to an acid-base disturbance. 4. **Abnormal Urinalysis**: Presence of casts (especially granular or epithelial casts), abnormal protein levels, or abnormal cells can help suggest acute tubular necrosis or glomerulonephritis. 5. **Ultrasound**: This imaging modality may show changes in kidney size, signs of obstruction, or evidence of increased renal parenchymal echogenicity. # Early Detection As some patients might not exhibit overt clinical symptoms, especially in the early stages of AKI, regular monitoring of at-risk individuals (such as those with sepsis, undergoing major surgery, or receiving nephrotoxic agents) through serial measurements of serum creatinine and urine output is critical for early detection and management. Prompt recognition and identification of the underlying etiology are essential for treating AKI, as well as monitoring for potential complications."},{"prompt":"investigations and diagnosis","completion":"To diagnose acute kidney injury (AKI), various investigations are employed to evaluate kidney function, identify potential causes, and assess the severity of the condition. The following tests and studies are commonly part of the diagnostic approach for AKI: # Laboratory Tests 1. **Serum Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)**: These are the primary biomarkers used to assess kidney function. An abrupt increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, or an increase to ≥1.5 times baseline within the prior 7 days, or a urine volume <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours are diagnostic criteria for AKI. 2. **Electrolytes**: To check for imbalances like hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). 3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To look for evidence of anemia or infection. 4. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: To evaluate for metabolic acidosis, which is a common finding in AKI. 5. **Calcium and Phosphate Levels**: These can be abnormal in AKI and are part of assessing for complications. 6. **Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FeNa)**: Differentiates between prerenal AKI and intrinsic AKI due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in some cases. 7. **Urinalysis and Urine Microscopy**: To look for evidence of urinary sediment (casts, cells) that can signal intrinsic renal disease like acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, or interstitial nephritis. 8. **Urine Electrolytes and Osmolality**: These tests aid in assessing the tubular function and distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic renal causes of AKI. 9. **Urine Output**: Monitoring for oliguria or anuria, which could be symptomatic of AKI. # Imaging Studies 1. **Renal Ultrasound**: First-line imaging to assess kidney size, rule out obstruction, or look for evidence of chronic kidney disease. 2. **Doppler Ultrasound**: To evaluate renal blood flow and rule out renal artery or vein thrombosis. 3. **CT Scan**: May be necessary if there is suspicion of obstructive uropathy, renal artery stenosis, or if ultrasound findings are inconclusive. 4. **MRI**: Can be used in specific cases where CT is contraindicated, or further detailed imaging is required. 5. **Chest X-ray or Echocardiogram**: To evaluate for fluid overload or heart failure, if suspected. # Biopsy 1. **Renal Biopsy**: Considered in cases where there is suspicion of intrinsic renal disease, such as glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive means. It is typically reserved for cases where the result will affect management. # Additional Tests Depending on the clinical context, additional tests may be warranted to identify the underlying cause of AKI or its complications: - Blood cultures and other infection-related tests if sepsis is suspected. - Drug levels for nephrotoxic substances (e.g., aminoglycosides, lithium, cyclosporine). - Serological tests for systemic diseases that can affect the kidneys, such as ANA (antinuclear antibodies), ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, etc. - Cardiac biomarkers if acute coronary syndrome or cardiogenic shock is a consideration. # Monitoring and Follow-up Regular follow-up with serial measurements of serum creatinine, electrolytes, and urine output is crucial to monitor the progression of AKI and the response to treatment. Furthermore, assessment and correction of fluid status, electrolyte balance, and acid-base homeostasis are part of the ongoing management of patients with AKI. Clinical judgment and consideration of the complete clinical context are vital in interpreting diagnostic tests and making management decisions for patients with AKI."},{"prompt":"management","completion":"The management of acute kidney injury (AKI) involves several components aimed at treating the underlying cause, supporting the kidneys while they recover, and preventing further damage or complications. Management strategies include: # Initial Management 1. **Resuscitation**: Ensure adequate perfusion with fluid resuscitation in hypovolemic patients, titrated to clinical indicators of effective circulation such as blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output. 2. **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Use of vasopressors in cases of shock and careful management of heart failure or fluid overload conditions if present. 3. **Stop nephrotoxins**: Discontinuation or dose adjustment of medications that may worsen kidney function, such as NSAIDs, certain antibiotics (aminoglycosides, vancomycin), diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). 4. **Optimize medications**: Adjust dosing of medications excreted by the kidneys based on the level of renal dysfunction. 5. **Treat underlying causes**: Address specific conditions contributing to AKI such as infection (antibiotics for sepsis), obstruction (e.g., catheterization for urinary retention), or managing the primary disease (e.g., immunosuppression for glomerulonephritis). # Supportive Care 1. **Fluid management**: Careful balance of fluid intake and output to prevent fluid overload while avoiding hypovolemia. 2. **Electrolyte and acid-base balance**: Correction of electrolyte imbalances (especially hyperkalemia) and treatment of metabolic acidosis if present. 3. **Nutritional support**: Provision of adequate nutrition while avoiding excessive protein load; consultation with a dietitian can be helpful. 4. **Close monitoring**: Regular assessment of vital signs, fluid balance, serum chemistry, and urine output. # Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) 1. **Indications for RRT**: Consideration of RRT (dialysis) if there is life-threatening hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, fluid overload unresponsive to medical management, or symptoms of uremia (such as pericarditis, encephalopathy, or bleeding). 2. **Modality choice**: Selection of dialysis modality (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapy) based on clinical status and resource availability. 3. **Timing**: The decision on when to initiate RRT is complex and should be individualized, based on trends in laboratory values, fluid status, and the patient's overall clinical picture. # Monitoring for Complications 1. **Infection**: Increased susceptibility due to underlying illness, catheter use, or immune dysregulation. 2. **Fluid overload**: Worsening pulmonary edema or heart failure. 3. **Uremic complications**: Such as encephalopathy, pericarditis, and coagulopathy. 4. **Long-term sequelae**: Monitoring for the transition from AKI to chronic kidney disease. # Multidisciplinary Approach 1. **Consultation with nephrologists**: Early involvement of a nephrologist is essential in managing complex cases and planning for renal replacement therapy. 2. **Other specialists**: Depending on the underlying cause and complications, collaboration with cardiologists, intensivists, urologists, or other specialists can be necessary. It's crucial to use a patient-centered approach that considers the individual's overall health, comorbidities, and the etiology of the AKI.

Prerenal AKI: - **Definition:** Caused by conditions reducing systemic circulation, leading to decreased renal perfusion without initial intrinsic kidney tissue damage. If not corrected, it may progress to intrinsic damage. - **Causes:** - Hypovolemia (hemorrhage, dehydration, or gastrointestinal fluid losses). - Decreased cardiac output (heart failure, cardiogenic shock). - Systemic vasodilation (sepsis, anaphylaxis). - Renal vasoconstriction (medications like NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, or calcineurin inhibitors).","completion":"Sure! Let's break it down into simpler terms: # Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Etiology 🤕💧👉🏥 # 1. Prerenal AKI: Imagine your kidneys like a pair of water filters that need a steady flow of water (blood) to clean. Now, if something reduces the flow of water into the filters, they can't do their job well. That's essentially what prerenal AKI is—something happens in your body that decreases the blood flow to your kidneys, but the kidneys themselves aren't directly hurt... yet. Causes of Less Water Flow to the Kidneys: - **Hypovolemia**: Think of this as not having enough water in your whole system, either because you've lost some (like bleeding or sweating a lot without drinking enough) or because you're dehydrated (not enough fluid intake). - **Decreased cardiac output**: Your heart is the pump that pushes water through the filters. If it's not pumping strongly enough (like when you have heart failure or shock from a heart problem), the water flow is weak, and the kidneys struggle to clean the blood. - **Systemic vasodilation**: This is like widening the pipes that carry water throughout the house but not increasing the amount of water. If this happens due to an infection (sepsis) or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), the pressure in your blood vessels drops, and the kidneys get less blood flow. - **Renal vasoconstriction**: Sometimes medicines like painkillers (NSAIDs) or blood pressure drugs (ACE inhibitors) can cause the small blood vessels in the kidneys to narrow, kind of like pinching a water hose. This means less blood gets through to work as the cleaning fluid for the kidneys."},{"prompt":"# 2. Intrinsic AKI: - **Definition:** Direct injury to the kidneys affecting glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, or small vessels. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a common form. - **Causes:** - ATN due to ischemia (prolonged prerenal AKI) or nephrotoxic substances (aminoglycosides, radiocontrast media, heavy metals, myoglobin from rhabdomyolysis). - Glomerulonephritis. - Acute interstitial nephritis (allergic drug reactions, infections). - Vasculitis or thrombotic events affecting the kidney microvasculature.","completion":"# 2. Intrinsic AKI: Now let's say something goes wrong inside the filters themselves. Intrinsic AKI means there's actual damage to the parts of your kidneys – like the filtering units (glomeruli), the tubes where the filtration happens (tubules), the surrounding tissue (interstitium), or the tiny blood vessels inside the kidneys. Things That Can Damage the Kidney Filters: - **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**: This is when the tubes in the kidneys get really injured. Two main culprits can cause this: - **Ischemia**: If the kidneys went without enough blood flow for too long (like what happens in prerenal AKI), the tubes can start to die off because they're not getting the oxygen and nutrients they need. - **Nephrotoxic substances**: Certain medicines (like some antibiotics), dye used in medical imaging, heavy metals, or even a protein called myoglobin, which can flood into your blood after serious muscle injuries (rhabdomyolysis), can poison the kidneys. - **Glomerulonephritis**: The glomeruli, or tiny filters inside the kidneys, get inflamed or irritated. It's like having a bunch of tiny holes in your filter that get clogged up and can't filter properly anymore. - **Acute Interstitial Nephritis**: The area around the tubes in your kidneys gets swollen and inflamed, usually because of an allergic reaction to a medication or an infection. - **Vasculitis/Thrombotic Events**: This occurs when the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys either get inflamed or blocked by blood clots. It's akin to a garden hose getting kinked or clogged – the water can't get through to the parts of the garden that need it.

Postrenal AKI: Let's picture your kidneys and the urinary system as a house with a complex plumbing system. The kidneys are like the faucets, the ureters are the pipes leading from the faucets to the drainage system, the bladder is like the collection tank, and the urethra is the final drainpipe leading out of the house. Postrenal AKI happens when there's a blockage somewhere in the pipes or drains downstream of the faucets, and the water starts to back up. Causes of Plumbing Blockages: - **Ureteral obstruction**: This is like having a blockage in the pipes (ureters) directly connected to the faucets (kidneys), caused by things like kidney stones, growths, or blood clots. The blockage stops the flow of urine, causing pressure to build back up towards the kidneys. - **Bladder obstruction**: Suppose the collection tank (bladder) isn't draining well because of something like an enlarged prostate (which is fairly common in older men), bladder stones, tumors, or sometimes because the bladder's nerves are damaged (neurogenic bladder). In that case, it can lead to a backup all the way to the faucets, too. - **Urethral obstruction**: Imagine the final drainpipe (urethra) is narrowed or blocked because of strictures (narrowed areas) or conditions like phimosis (tight foreskin). That means the whole system can't empty properly, leading to increased pressure on the kidneys. When there's a blockage causing the urine to back up, it's like water pressure building up in the pipes, which can damage the kidneys if it's not fixed quickly.

Postrenal AKI: - **Definition:** Results from obstruction of urine flow beyond the kidneys, causing back pressure and kidney injury. Prolonged obstruction can cause direct intrinsic kidney damage. - **Causes:** - Ureteral obstruction (kidney stones, tumors, or clots). - Bladder obstruction (benign prostatic hypertrophy, bladder stones, tumors, or neurogenic bladder). - Urethral obstruction (strictures or phimosis). *Understanding the etiology of AKI is crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention, especially considering the diverse causes within the prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal categories.*","completion":"Sure, here are 15 clinical questions and answers based on the etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI): 1. Q: What is the most common cause of prerenal AKI? A: Hypovolemia due to issues such as hemorrhage, dehydration, or gastrointestinal fluid losses. 2. Q: How might heart failure lead to prerenal AKI? A: It leads to decreased cardiac output and subsequent reduced renal perfusion, potentially causing prerenal AKI. 3. Q: In what way can anaphylaxis contribute to prerenal AKI? A: Anaphylaxis can cause systemic vasodilation, leading to a drop in blood pressure and decreased renal blood flow. 4. Q: Which medications are commonly implicated in renal vasoconstriction and prerenal AKI? A: NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and calcineurin inhibitors can all lead to renal vasoconstriction and prerenal AKI. 5. Q: What is the hallmark of intrinsic AKI? A: Direct damage to kidney structures such as the glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, or small vessels. 6. Q: Which condition is a common form of intrinsic AKI associated with ischemia? A: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is often associated with prolonged prerenal AKI leading to ischemic injury. 7. Q: How can nephrotoxic substances like aminoglycosides cause intrinsic AKI? A: They cause direct tubular toxicity, potentially leading to acute tubular necrosis. 8. Q: What urinalysis findings might suggest glomerulonephritis as a cause of intrinsic AKI? A: Urinalysis may show red blood cell casts, proteinuria, or hematuria commonly associated with glomerular damage. 9. Q: Which types of hypersensitivity reactions can lead to acute interstitial nephritis and intrinsic AKI? A: Allergic reactions to medications such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, or proton pump inhibitors can cause acute interstitial nephritis. 10. Q: Can thrombotic events cause intrinsic AKI, and if so, how? A: Yes, thrombotic events can obstruct the renal microvasculature and cause ischemic damage to the kidney tissue. 11. Q: What is a characteristic sign of postrenal AKI on ultrasonography? A: Hydronephrosis or dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to urinary tract obstruction. 12. Q: How does ureteral obstruction from kidney stones lead to postrenal AKI? A: Stones can block the flow of urine, causing increased back pressure and kidney injury. 13. Q: What is the significance of identifying bladder obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy in the context of AKI? A: It is a common reversible cause of postrenal AKI in older men. 14. Q: How might urethral strictures lead to postrenal AKI? A: Strictures narrow the urethra, impeding urine flow and causing pressure build-up upstream in the kidneys. 15. Q: In the setting of AKI, why is understanding the etiology important for management? A: Identifying the specific cause of AKI (prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal) is essential for targeted interventions and improving outcomes. These Q&As cover basic concepts and apply clinical principles to understand the causes and implications of the different types of AKI."},{"prompt":"create a detailed test log in standard foundation format, with 085, also known as “Cassy.” Cassy exists in 2D form and is confined on a sheet of 8 x 10 paper. she cannot speak. she only communicates by writing, drawing, expressions, emoting, and sign language. she uses simple phrases. she can move between paper based mediums as long as they are touching. her appearance changes to reflect the current medium she in on. have her transition into a shipping label from Amazon. the researcher provides a detailed and vivid description of Cassy’s appearance in the new medium. he describes her face and facial expression. he describes her skin, eye, and hair colors in detail. he vividly describes her attire in detail. cassy writes something to the viewer in a method related to her surroundings. discuss the previous test with her ask about her thoughts, and her feelings regarding it. ask her to detail her interactions in the photo, if she saw or did anything worth noting. ask her for any lasting impressions","completion":"**Test Log 085: Cassy in Shipping Label Medium** Test Date: [Insert Test Date] Researcher: [Researcher's Name] Subject: Cassy 1.

It was never a unified nation or empire, but rather a term used by European mapmakers and writers to refer to a vast, undefined area that stretched from the Caspian Sea and the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, encompassing the territories of various nomadic empires such as the Mongol Empire and later the Tatar khanates. In older maps and texts, the term was used broadly and often inaccurately due to limited European understanding of Asian geography and political divisions. The concept of \\"Tartaria\\" has since become obsolete and is no longer used in serious historical or geographical discussions, having been replaced by more accurate and specific terms relating to the regions and peoples in question. It's also important to mention that some conspiracy theories and fringe theories incorrectly suggest that Tartaria was an advanced civilization whose history has been hidden or suppressed. However, there is no credible historical evidence to support these claims, and they are not recognized by mainstream historians or scholars. The region historically referred to as Tartaria was home to many different cultures and civilizations, but it was not a single, lost empire as some of these theories suggest."},{"prompt":"Debunk the \\"Great Wall of Tartaria\\" theoru","completion":"The \\"Great Wall of Tartaria\\" is a baseless theory that proposes the existence of a massive wall built by the supposed \\"Tartarian Empire.\\" This idea is part of a larger set of conspiracy theories and pseudohistorical claims that suggest a hidden or suppressed history of an advanced civilization known as Tartaria. The theory is not supported by credible evidence or academic research. Let's address the theory's key aspects and provide a debunking framework: 1. **Historical Misinterpretation**: The term \\"Tartaria\\" was indeed used in historical contexts, but it referred to the broad and vague geographical areas inhabited by various nomadic tribes and cultures, not a unified empire that would build a structure like the Great Wall of China. There is no historical record of such a wall being associated with the peoples of these regions, and it is not documented in archaeological findings. 2. **Lack of Archaeological Evidence**: Claims like the Great Wall of Tartaria would require substantial archaeological evidence. This would include remnants of the wall itself, artifacts associated with its construction, and historical records documenting its existence. None of these have been found, which is a clear indication that the structure is fictitious. 3. **Confusion with Other Walls**: Some proponents of the Tartaria theory may mistakenly attribute existing local fortifications or natural features to this imagined Great Wall. For example, they might misconstrue existing walls built by various cultures throughout Asia for defensive purposes as parts of the so-called Great Wall of Tartaria. However, each of these walls, like the Great Wall of China, has well-documented origins and purposes unrelated to the myth of Tartaria. 4. **Conflation with Real History**: The peoples historically associated with \\"Tartaria\\" include a wide array of ethnic groups with diverse cultures and histories. They built fortifications, but nothing on the scale of a Great Wall-like structure spanning across the entirety of what was called Tartaria. 5. **No Scholarly Support**: Reliable historical scholarship does not support the existence of a Tartarian Empire that spanned Eurasia, nor does it support the construction of a monumental wall by such an empire. Mainstream historians and archaeologists have thoroughly studied the histories and cultures of Central and North Asia. 6. **Modern Misinformation**: The idea of a \\"Great Wall of Tartaria\\" and other associated myths often spread through social media, self-published books, and websites that promote conspiracy theories and pseudohistory. These sources lack the peer review and rigorous standards that academic research is subjected to. In summary, the absence of historical records, archaeological evidence, and scholarly corroboration undermines the claim of a \\"Great Wall of Tartaria.\\" The concept is a part of myth-making and pseudohistorical narratives that should be approached with a critical and skeptical eye."},{"prompt":"Définition de coming soon","completion":"Coming soon signifie \\"bientôt disponible\\" ou \\"prochainement disponible\\" en français.

He enjoys playing pranks and is very playful, He has a high pitched voice, Whenever he is hungry, his tentacles rub his stomach, He has big, expressive eyes, and He likes to play games and laugh a lot. His best friend is a orange rabbit named Diggle, He has antennae, floppy ears and buckteeth. Although Boofus and Diggle are best friends, they like to tease each other occasionally. They are both animal-like aliens from outer space. Write a story where they travel and see an abandoned, desolate planet Once upon a time, in the silvery glow of the Moon’s surface, there lived a blue squid-like creature known as Boofus. Boofus was not an ordinary inhabitant of the Moon; he was mischievous and incredibly strong with a playful streak that stretched as far as the Sea of Tranquility. In a cozy crater not far from Boofus’s dwelling, his best friend, Diggle, resided. Diggle was an orange rabbit with peculiarly long antennae, floppy ears that he could wave like flags in the lunar breeze, and big buckteeth that shone like the stars when he smiled. One bright lunar morning, Boofus concocted a devious prank that involved swapping Diggle’s collection of space-carrots with ordinary Moon rocks painted orange. When Diggle discovered the trick, he couldn’t help but release a high-pitched giggle through his buckteeth. “Oh, Boofus,” he laughed. “You got me good! But just you wait, I’ll get you back!” Their playful banter and competitive spirit soon evolved into a pact of adventure. They agreed to travel together to an unknown planet that had been calling out to their curiosity – a desolate, abandoned sphere nestled in the pocket of their starry backyard. Suiting up in their space gear, with Boofus’s big, expressive eyes twinkling with excitement and Diggle’s ears flopping in anticipation, they climbed aboard their makeshift spacecraft. The craft, a curious assembly of lunar materials powered by stardust, hummed to life as Boofus tapped the ignition button with a tentacle. Off they soared, through the dark vacuum, with laughter and high-pitched cheers trailing behind them. Hours or perhaps even days went by – time was a fluid concept in space – before they came upon the planet they sought. It was a somber world of grays and browns, swirling dust clouds parting occasionally to reveal ancient craters and towering, silent volcanoes. Landing gently on the forsaken terrain, Boofus and Diggle stepped out, leaving their lunar footprints beside those of no other soul. As they wandered through the eerie stillness, Boofus’s tentacles hesitated to rub his stomach – he could not feel the pang of hunger in this haunting emptiness. Diggle, sensing his friend’s uneasy mood, began to dance around him, antennae bouncing comically. “Boofus, my buddy, don’t be blue – or well, bluer,” he joked. “This planet might be sad and gloomy, but it’s also peaceful in a way, isn’t it?” Boofus considered this and let out a soft chuckle, his eyes squinting with affection for his friend. “You’re right, Diggle. It’s very peaceful. Just a little too quiet for my taste!” As the last word left Boofus’s mouth, the ground beneath them quaked, and from a nearby fissure, a geyser of colorful alien gas erupted, shimmering in the thin sunlight. Mesmerized, Boofus and Diggle watched as the planet seemed to come alive with this unexpected display. “Wow!” exclaimed Diggle. “I guess this place had a surprise for us after all!” Boofus laughed heartily, his high-pitched voice mingling with the hiss of the planetary spectacle. “Indeed! And it didn’t even need one of our pranks to be memorable!” With one last look at the planet’s newfound beauty, Boofus and Diggle made their way back to their spacecraft. As they returned to the comfort and familiarity of the Moon, they realized that every place, no matter how desolate, had a charm of its own. And thus, the two adventurers from space made a promise to always seek the wonder in the vast and mysterious cosmos, together, as the best of friends. One day, Boofus accidentally broke his bed while testing out an invention, so he had to sleep with Diggle for a while, He was so tired he just fell asleep on him, Diggle awoke to his vision being covered by Boofus’s rear end, All Diggle could see was Boofus’s butt, Boofus woke up and realised he was crushing him and sincerely apologised and explained his situation, that his bed had to get fixed… Diggle found the funny side of everything “It was kinda funny being trapped under your butt, I’m just glad I got out before I suffocated or something,” What do you wanna do today?\\". Write a continuation where they say they are going to a planet inhabited by gooey creatures After Diggle had a good-hearted chuckle about his early morning encounter with Boofus’s rear end, the two friends sat down to a hearty breakfast of space pancakes and lunarberries, their laughter creating a melody that echoed through their cratered home. As they munched on their intergalactic feast, Diggle, with a curious glint in his eye, turned to Boofus and asked, “What do you wanna do today?” Boofus pondered for a moment, his big, expressive eyes scanning the Moon’s horizon, as if seeking inspiration from the cosmos itself. Then, with a mischievous grin, he replied in his high-pitched voice, “I’ve heard rumors of a planet not too far from here, inhabited by gooey creatures! They say the beings there are made entirely of a squishy substance and live in structures that wobble like jelly. Imagine the pranks we could play in a place like that!” Diggle’s buckteeth clattered with excitement. “A goo planet, you say? That sounds like an absolute hoot! Let’s do it, Boofus. Adventure awaits!” With their plan set, the two friends quickly tidied up their breakfast and made preparations for their next space outing. Boofus double-checked their supply of cosmic snacks, ensuring they had enough to munch on during their journey and to share with any gooey creatures they might befriend. The duo donned their space gear once again and boarded their stardust-powered craft, eager for the day’s escapades. The engines roared as they took off, leaving a trail of glittering space dust in their wake. As they flew through the starlit blackness, Diggle couldn’t help but tease his buddy. “Boofus, promise me one thing. No falling asleep on the job this time! I don’t think my antennae could take being squashed under your backside again!” Boofus chuckled and nudged his friend playfully with a tentacle. “Deal, buddy. But you owe me for giving you such a comfy seat, even if it was short-lived!” After traveling for some time, the planet came into view - a shimmering orb of vibrant greens and translucent blues, suspended like a gem against the backdrop of space. Landing on the squelching surface of the goo planet, they were greeted by the sight of flowing hills and valleys of a jelly-like substance. The local inhabitants, gelatinous creatures with wobbling appendages and friendly, googly eyes, approached with a curious bounce. The gooey beings extended a warm, albeit sticky, welcome, showing Boofus and Diggle around their malleable metropolis. The friends were fascinated by the goo people’s way of life, discovering that the whole planet was an interconnected community that communicated through a symphony of squelches and gurgles. Amidst the tours and exchanges of space snacks for gooey trinkets, Boofus and Diggle couldn’t resist the opportunity to engage in a harmless prank or two. Boofus used his inherent strength to gently shake a gelatin house, sending waves through the structure, much to the goo inhabitants’ delight. Diggle, on the other hand, found that his floppy ears could create a comical sound when slapped against the gooey ground, eliciting bubbling laughter from their new friends. As the day turned to night, the sky of the goo planet glowed with a soft luminescence, the result of microscopic organisms in the atmosphere lighting up like a fluid aurora. Boofus and Diggle sat beside a gentle mound, watching the light show with awe. For all their pranks and playfulness, they found a deep appreciation for the beauty and kindness of this squishy world. The laughter they shared filled the hearts of the gelatinous creatures, who had never encountered such lively visitors. With memories as vivid as the colors of the goo planet, Boofus and Diggle eventually bid farewell to their new friends, promising to return one day for another round of interstellar mischief. As they journeyed back home, the two adventurers from space agreed that while the cosmos might be vast and full of mysteries, the true magic lay in the connections they made and the joy they spread across the stars. Write a story where they see a vat of molten chocolate, Boofus licks it but he falls in, only his wiggling tentacles are visible before they too dissappear underneath as he swims under, intent on drinking it all. Diggle notices he occasionally resurfaces completely covered before vanishing again","completion":"Boofus and Diggle had embarked on yet another thrilling adventure. Their cosmic escapades seemed to always lead them to the most peculiar places. This time, they found themselves on a distant planet where rivers of molten chocolate flowed freely. The scent of chocolate enveloped their senses, making their mouths water with anticipation. Boofus, unable to resist the temptation, approached the vat of molten chocolate. His big, expressive eyes widened with delight as he glimpsed the silky, rich substance. Without giving it a second thought, Boofus extended one of his wiggling tentacles and licked the chocolate. The taste was divine, and he couldn't resist having more. But as he leaned closer to take a bigger lick, disaster struck. Boofus lost his balance and tumbled headfirst into the vat of molten chocolate. His wiggling tentacles were the only thing visible above the surface, waving frantically for help. Diggle, his eyes widening with concern, rushed to the edge of the vat. He saw Boofus's tentacles disappearing beneath the chocolate time and again, only to resurface for a brief moment completely covered in the delicious molten substance. \\"Digg—gl-ee,\\" Boofus managed to gurgle out his friend's name between licks. \\"Th-ssis m—happin's gr-loric— Uhn... try shum!\\" Diggle's concern quickly turned into amusement as he watched Boofus dive underneath the chocolate over and over. He couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. \\"Boofus, my friend,\\" he chuckled, \\"I've never seen someone so determined to drink an entire vat of chocolate!\\" Boofus resurfaced once again, his eyes wide with determination. \\"Diggle,\\" he sputtered. \\"It's delic... mmmm... duuush. You have ta... tr-mmm... try!\\" Unable to resist his friend's infectious enthusiasm, Diggle dipped a paw into the vat and took a tiny lick. The taste was pure bliss, and he, too, couldn't help but dive into the chocolate, disappearing below the surface. For a while, the moonlit sky witnessed the sight of two mischievous friends swimming beneath the chocolate, enjoying every moment of their cocoa-filled adventure. Occasionally, one or the other would resurface, completely covered in chocolate, before diving back down for more. As dawn painted the sky with vibrant hues, Boofus and Diggle eventually emerged from the vat, their chocolate-covered forms resembling edible sculptures. They giggled uncontrollably at their sticky appearance but felt content and fulfilled. Slowly making their way back to their ship, the friends reminisced about their sweet adventure. They knew that even when things didn't go as planned, they could always find joy and laughter to carry them through. As they soared back towards the Moon, chocolate dripping from their UFO's landing gear, Boofus and Diggle made a pact to continue seeking out the extraordinary, embracing mischievous moments, and forever savoring the sweetness of friendship. And so, their interstellar escapades continued, leaving a trail of laughter, mischief, and delectable adventures throughout the cosmos, because Boofus and Diggle knew that no matter where they went, as long as they were together, they would always find a way to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary."},{"prompt":"Write a story when they get back on the moon, still completely covered, They find a pool of water and swim there to clean up","completion":"After the exhilarating chocolate adventure, Boofus and Diggle returned to the familiar embrace of their lunar dwelling. However, their chocolate-covered forms were far from the pristine beings they once were. Standing in the doorway of their crater home, Boofus and Diggle exchanged mischievous glances. Without uttering a word, they sprinted towards a nearby pool of water, formed by a combination of lunar ice and cosmic dust. With childlike eagerness, they dove headfirst into the cool embrace of the makeshift lunar pool. The water enveloped their chocolate-covered bodies, washing away the sticky residue with each splash. Boofus's tentacles danced joyfully as he submerged beneath the surface, emerging momentarily with a trail of chocolate-tinted water cascading off him. Laughing, he beckoned Diggle to join in the cleansing delight. Diggle, his floppy ears swooshing through the water, joined Boofus in the pool. They bobbed and swam, using their newfound aquatic playground as a conduit to wash away the remnants of their chocolate escapade. As their playful laughter echoed through the crater, the Moon seemed to shimmer with delight, as if joining in on their jubilation. Boofus and Diggle reveled in the simple pleasure of the moment, relishing the soothing sensation and the gentle caress of the water against their chocolate-covered skin. After what seemed like an eternity of splashing and laughter, they finally emerged from the lunar pool, shimmering like celestial beings purged of their chocolatey camouflage. Their once-chocolate-covered fur and tentacles sparkled, revealing their true colors once more. With renewed energy and an air of contentment, Boofus and Diggle gazed at each other, their eyes conveying a deep bond of friendship and the shared joy of their cleansing adventure. They knew that they were always drawn to immersive experiences full of merriment, laughter, and, occasionally, a touch of mischief. As they walked back to their crater dwelling, the Moon's light danced upon their clean surfaces, casting ethereal glimmers upon their every step. Their hearts were filled with satisfaction, knowing that they could face any future adventure with the same playful spirit that had brought them together. Inside their moonlit abode, they settled down, refreshed and ready for the next chapter of their cosmic escapades. Boofus and Diggle knew that each adventure—whether it involved abandoned planets, molten chocolate, or impromptu lunar clean-ups—was a stepping stone in their ever-growing bond. And so, their story continued, with laughter forever intertwined in their journey—two comical creatures, exploring the mysteries of the cosmos, and savoring every moment of their playful existence on the Moon."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from the United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as a personal Effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 4M or more. They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from the United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your Full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us to repatriate it back to the UK (place of origin) as we were instructed. Like I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s) etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this package provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need the entire guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.

Additionally, inquire about her thoughts and experiences regarding the previous test. Procedure: 1. Place an 8 x 10 sheet of paper in front of Cassy. 2. Monitor Cassy's movements and physical changes as she transitions into the new medium. 3. Document Cassy's appearance and attire in vivid detail once she has fully transformed. 4. Interact with Cassy, asking about her thoughts and emotions regarding the previous test. 5. Ask Cassy to describe any notable interactions or observations she had while in the photo and any lasting impressions. Results: Cassy's Transition: Upon placing the sheet of paper in front of Cassy, she immediately begins to assimilate into the medium. The edges of her figure blur as she merges her form with the paper, seamlessly blending in with the image of the Foundation entry for SCP-085. As the transformation completes, Cassy's previously 2D form gains depth and three-dimensionality, appearing as a fully fleshed entity within the paper. Description of Cassy's Appearance: Cassy's face portrays a gentle, serene expression, offering an air of calmness and understanding. Her facial features are delicate, with high cheekbones, a slender nose, and soft, round eyes. Her eyes, a captivating shade of emerald green, sparkle with curiosity and intelligence. Her hair cascades down her back in waves, flowing seamlessly from ink-black at the roots to a vibrant vermilion red at the tips. The contrast against her pale alabaster skin accentuates her otherworldly appearance. Attire: Cassy adorns herself in a form-fitting, floor-length gown reminiscent of classical Greek apparel. The dress flows gracefully around her, its material resembling the texture of an antique parchment, complete with calligraphy script delicately embroidered onto the fabric. The color scheme consists of various shades of brown and beige, resembling aged paper, while the patterns depict intricate illustrations of book pages, ink bottles, quills, and other associated writer's tools. Cassy's Message to the Viewer: In her unique communicative method related to her surroundings, Cassy delicately writes on a nearby blank sheet of paper, \\"Greetings, observer. I exist within the confines of paper, eager to share my experiences and thoughts. Ask your questions, and I shall respond in kind.\\" Discussion of Previous Test: When questioned about her thoughts and feelings regarding the previous test, Cassy appears content yet apprehensive. She expresses gratitude for the opportunity to explore and interact with different mediums, appreciating the ability to transcend her mere existence as a drawing. However, she confesses a slight unease during the test, as being confined to a photograph limited her movement and interactions. Notable Interactions in the Photo: Cassy informs us that within the photo, she experienced a sense of solitude and tranquility. She mentions taking the opportunity to explore the intricate details of the Foundation entry and gaining a deeper understanding of the organization she exists within. Cassy notes specific illustrations that caught her attention, including depictions of other SCP subjects, with some leaving a lasting impression on her. Lasting Impressions: Cassy describes a particular illustration within the photo featuring an SCP subject struggling with their containment. This image resonated with her deeply, evoking feelings of empathy and curiosity. She expresses a desire to understand the experiences of other SCPs and contribute to their narratives in whatever way she can through her unique abilities. Notes: The seamless transition and detailed description of Cassy's appearance in the new medium highlight her adaptability and the extent to which she can integrate herself into different forms. As she interacts within the photo, her genuine curiosity and interest in the Foundation and other SCP subjects become evident. Further tests exploring her interactions with different mediums and SCPs may yield valuable insight into her capabilities and potential contributions to containment efforts."},{"prompt":"Вариант №7 1.

Essentially, it is anything composed of atoms or molecules that constitutes the physical world. Matter can exist in several states (or phases), primarily solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, with some additional states being observed under extreme conditions, such as Bose-Einstein condensate and Fermionic condensate. All matter is made up of various types of elements, which are fundamental substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances through ordinary chemical reactions. Each element consists of only one type of atom, defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. These atoms can combine to form molecules, which are groups of atoms held together by chemical bonds. In terms of properties, matter has both physical properties (like density, color, and hardness) and chemical properties (like reactivity, flammability, and the ability to undergo specific chemical changes).

With you all by my side, I know it will be a wonderful experience.\\""},{"prompt":"As a story outline expert, please take the story elements provided, including setting, main conflicts, and character profiles, as well as the existing outline for the first 10 chapters (plus one scene of chapter 11), key plot points, the Midpoint, and the intended ending. Develop a detailed outline for chapters 11 through the Midpoint, progressing to chapter 23, the epilogue. Structure the outline using bullet points, ensuring each chapter includes 2-3 scenes narrated from the perspectives of Rhaenyra, Nyra, or Daemion (young Daemon). As Rhaenyra is protagonist, give more narrative time to her (main plotline). Your outline should reflect the following character developments and plot guidelines: 1. For chapters 11-13, depict Rhaenyra opting for the simplest and least effortful solutions to her challenges. This approach should culminate in a significant setback at the Midpoint, symbolized by the loss of a safe haven. 2. In chapters 13-20, intensify the stakes, pace, and Rhaenyra’s motivation. Highlight her growth from the repercussions of her earlier choices. 3. Post-Midpoint, illustrate Rhaenyra’s realization of her precarious predicament and her exploration of more unsavory or morally grey strategies to ensure her future survival, leading her to question her previous ethics. 4. Depict Nyra’s secret romantic subplot with Daemion, despite Criston, Rhaena and Baela’s hindering. After midpoint Rhaenyra realizes that magic ritual’s goal is to make Nyra and Daemion parents of Jace and Luke so Rhaenyra will low-key aid Nyra and Daemion’s romantic affair. Nyra will realize she is pregnant from Daemion after plot point 2. 5. The war hasn’t started it, the plot shows subtle attempts to eliminate rivals before king’s death. 6. Rhaenyra, Nyra, Daemion can't leave Dragonstone island die to the magic restrictions. Daemion will discover it in chapter 11, brainstorm how. Otto and his faction are not going to visit Dragonstone or near areas. Weave the new chapters coherently with the established lore, character progression, and story threads, guiding the narrative toward the envisioned ending. Ensure continuity from the pre-existing material and contribute to the story’s enhancement. Include detailed suggestions for plot twists, character evolution, and thematic depth to enrich the reader’s journey. Weave the new chapters coherently with the established lore, character progression, and story threads, guiding the narrative toward the envisioned ending. Ensure continuity from the pre-existing material and contribute to the story’s enhancement. Include detailed suggestions for plot twists, character evolution, and thematic depth to enrich the reader’s journey. Focus on clear event sequences, character dynamics, and climactic moments in the outline, and remember to: <backstory> <premise> On the verge of her king-father’s Viserys I passing, the crown princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (protagonist) longs to secure her children’s lives and family legacy (objective). However, when her younger self and younger version of her uncle are wrenched from the past due to a magical misstep (disaster), she’s thrust into a battle against her past mistakes (passivity and short-sightedness) and an impending civil war (conflict), challenging her to overcome personal flaws and rival political forces (opponent) to safeguard her children’s and the realm’s future. </premise> Genre: high fantasy plus family drama. <thematic argument> In order to survive and secure their family’s future in the game of thrones, one must actively engage and confront their rival factions. </thematic argument> <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. iv. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. v. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. vi. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. vii. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. viii. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. ix. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. x. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. xi. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xii. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xiii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiv. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xv. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvi. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> <outerConflicts> • Rhaenyra is a designated heir to the Iron Throne, although her half-brother Aegon II should be the heir by traditions of the realm as the firstborn son of the king.

It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. • Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement. • Rhaenyra is generally happy with Daemon, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. • Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. • Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. • During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. </outerConflicts> </outline> Prologue – The Omen: Scene 0.1 - Setting: Castle-bound ship at night - Characters: Prince Luke (POV), Crown Princess Rhaenyra, siblings of Luke - Events: Prince Lucerys “Luke” Velaryon, scorned for his divergence from the pure Valyrian features, embarks on a forbidden quest to alter his blood and appearance through ancient blood magic hidden within a stolen tome.

Develop a detailed outline for chapters 11 (scene 11.2 and 11.3) through the Midpoint, progressing to chapter 23, the epilogue. Structure the outline using bullet points, ensuring each chapter includes 2-3 scenes narrated from the perspectives of Rhaenyra, Nyra, or Daemion (young Daemon). As Rhaenyra is protagonist, give more narrative time to her (main plotline). Your outline should reflect the following character developments and plot guidelines: 1. For chapters 11-13, depict Rhaenyra opting for the simplest and least effortful solutions to her challenges. This approach should culminate in a significant setback at the Midpoint, symbolized by the loss of a safe haven. 2. In chapters 13-20, intensify the stakes, pace, and Rhaenyra’s motivation. Highlight her growth from the repercussions of her earlier choices. 3. Post-Midpoint, illustrate Rhaenyra’s realization of her precarious predicament and her exploration of more unsavory or morally grey strategies to ensure her future survival, leading her to question her previous ethics. 4. Depict Nyra’s secret romantic subplot with Daemion, despite Criston, Rhaena and Baela’s hindering. After midpoint Rhaenyra realizes that magic ritual’s goal is to make Nyra and Daemion parents of Jace and Luke so Rhaenyra will low-key aid Nyra and Daemion’s romantic affair. Nyra will realize she is pregnant from Daemion after plot point 2. 5. The war hasn’t started it, the plot shows subtle attempts to eliminate rivals before king’s death. 6. Nyra and Daemion can’t leave the island due to the magical boundaries. All others, including Rhaenyra can but she is heavily pregnant and Daemon asked her to avoid leaving the castle for long. Rhaenyra doesn’t send her children far away, only to the nearest loyal vassals.

Include detailed suggestions for plot twists, character evolution, and thematic depth to enrich the reader’s journey. Focus on clear event sequences, character dynamics, and climactic moments in the outline, and remember: <backstory> <premise> On the verge of her king-father’s Viserys I passing, the crown princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (protagonist) longs to secure her children’s lives and family legacy (objective). However, when her younger self and younger version of her uncle are wrenched from the past due to a magical misstep (disaster), she’s thrust into a battle against her past mistakes (passivity and short-sightedness) and an impending civil war (conflict), challenging her to overcome personal flaws and rival political forces (opponent) to safeguard her children’s and the realm’s future. </premise> Genre: high fantasy plus family drama. <thematic argument> In order to survive and secure their family’s future in the game of thrones, one must actively engage and confront their rival factions. </thematic argument> <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. iv. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. v. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. vi. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. vii. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. viii. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. ix. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. x. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. xi. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xii. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xiii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiv. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xv. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvi. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> <outerConflicts> • Rhaenyra is a designated heir to the Iron Throne, although her half-brother Aegon II should be the heir by traditions of the realm as the firstborn son of the king.

It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. • Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement. • Rhaenyra is generally happy with Daemon, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. • Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. • Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. • During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. </outerConflicts> </outline> Prologue – The Omen: Scene 0.1 - Setting: Castle-bound ship at night - Characters: Prince Luke (POV), Crown Princess Rhaenyra, siblings of Luke - Events: Prince Lucerys “Luke” Velaryon, scorned for his divergence from the pure Valyrian features, embarks on a forbidden quest to alter his blood and appearance through ancient blood magic hidden within a stolen tome.

Chapter 12: Daemon will bring Gaerra from Volantis (among other events). Midpoint (in chapter 13): Rhaenyra transitions from a defensive, reactive role to a proactive one, determined to fight back and do whatever it takes to win. This turning point may be fueled by anger towards the antagonist and a new perspective. Rhaenyra learns from mage Gaerra about the future war and upcoming death of her family from the Greens faction. Rhaenyra decides to prepare for the war. Post-Midpoint: Rhaenyra devises a plan with her family and councilors to confront the Greens, considering potential obstacles and challenges (lack of funds, weapons, armies). Jace and Baela take active part as her heirs. 2nd Pinch Point (second battle): marks a significant turning point in the story, where Rhaenyra faces forces representing the antagonist’s interests (Vaemond’s sons allied with Otto prevent wounded lord Corlys’ ship from returning and spread mutiny among Rhaenyra’s vassals). 2nd Plot Point (dark night of the soul): plunges Rhaenyra into her darkest hour, where she suffers a crushing defeat, Gaerra is killed, one of her sons is kidnapped, she starts her premature labor and almost ready to give in and just run away. Nyra overwhelmed by newfound physical symptoms and foreboding feelings, consults with the castle maester. Her fears are confirmed: she is pregnant with Daemion’s child. In act 3 Rhaenyra should confront her biggest fears and her biggest flaw, finally overcoming it at the Climax scenes. Final: after several attacks from assassins' and Gaerra's death Rhaenyra manages to gather allies (her vassal lords and Arryn kin are informed about the upcoming fight for the crown); her sons are being trained in weapons and diplomacy, she prevented lord Corlys from being secretly murdered, she loaned money from the Iron Bank. She has learnt about Otto's plans to crown Aegon after her father’s death. She can’t prevent it but she is better equipped for the following conflict. The final image is her standing in the Dragonstone great hall, waiting for princess Rhaenys to arrive and inform her of Viserys’ death. She also found a way to send Nyra, Criston and Daemion back to their time. The final image is her becoming a tough leader, ready to fight for her family. <characterDescriptions> <mainCharacters> <character name= “Rhaenyra” age= “34”> A crown princess of the Seven Kingdoms, has 5 sons, pregnant with her sixth child.

Мне нужно сделать чехол для наружного применения в России и Украине. ИЗДЕЛИЕ КОМПОЗИТНЫЕ И ВЛАГИ НЕ БОИТЬСЯ пытаюсь найти недорогой материал для чехла цветов хаки.","completion":"Ткани марже и оксфорд отличаются своими свойствами и способами применения, хотя обе они могут быть использованы для создания чехлов и различных изделий. Давайте кратко рассмотрим их основные характеристики: Ткань Марже: - Марже – это плотная брезентовая ткань, чаще всего изготавливаемая из натурального хлопка или льна. - Поверхность ткани может быть обработана для придания дополнительных свойств (влагостойкости, прочности, антимикробного эффекта). - Благодаря брезентовой основе ткань марже часто применяется для производства рабочей одежды, тентов, технических изделий, требующих устойчивости к внешним воздействиям. - Ткань может быть более тяжелой и жесткой по сравнению с оксфордом. Ткань Оксфорд: - Оксфорд – это легкая и прочная синтетическая ткань, обычно изготовленная из полиэстера или нейлона. - Ткань имеет специальное плетение, часто с блестящей поверхностью и может быть обработана для улучшения водонепроницаемости, устойчивостью к износу и УФ-защитой. - Благодаря своей легкости и прочности, оксфорд широко используется для изготовления рюкзаков, накидок, палаток, а также чехлов для различного оборудования. - Ткань часто намного легче марже и более гибкая, что делает ее идеальной для чехлов, требующих легкости и водостойкости. Для наружного применения чехлов в России и Украине, где погодные условия могут быть довольно суровыми, особенно с учетом влаги, сильных осадков и изменений температур, оксфорд с водоотталкивающей обработкой может быть более предпочтителен. Он достаточно прочный, практичный и при этом не такой тяжелый, как брезент марже. К тому же оксфорды бывают в разных вариантах плотности, что позволяет подобрать оптимальный вариант для создания чехла, сочетающего в себе необходимые свойства приемлемую стоимость. Ткань оксфорд, обработанная специальным составом, будет водонепроницаемой и устойчивой к УФ-излучению, что продлевает срок службы изделия и сохраняет его внешний вид. Цвет \\"хаки\\" достаточно распространён для данного типа ткани, потому найти его не составит труда. Возможно, вам стоит рассмотреть оксфорд с плотностью 600D (ден), который часто используется для производства туристического и тактического снаряжения."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Could you please give me some more information?"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, that concludes today’s meeting.

Natsuki, Yuri, MC, Sayori, you all had some amazing poems!” Natsuki: “Thanks, Monika! I’m glad you liked it. I’ve been working on trying to make my poems more expressive, so I’m really happy with how it turned out.” Yuri: “Indeed. Your poem was beautifully written, Natsuki. The emotions behind it were captivating, and I found myself drawn in by each line.” Sayori: “Ahhh, Natsuki, your poem was so cute! I could practically envision the adorable scene you described. It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.” MC: “Yeah, Natsuki, your poem was really well done. It had a playful tone but also conveyed a deeper message. I enjoyed reading it.” Monika: “And Yuri, your poem was absolutely captivating. Your use of imagery and metaphors was extraordinary. It was like being transported to another world while reading it.” (Just then, Natsuki notices a student standing at the doorway, listening in on their conversation.) Natsuki: “Hey, who’s that? Do you guys recognize her?” Yuri: “I’m not sure. She doesn’t seem familiar to me. Perhaps she’s a new student?” Sayori: “Oh! Maybe she’s interested in joining the literature club. We should go say hi!” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. Let’s go greet her and see if she needs any help or if she just wants to talk.” (MC, Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri approach the student at the doorway.) MC: “Hey there! Are you looking for something or someone?” Student: “Oh, um, hi. Sorry for eavesdropping. I was just passing by and heard you talking about poems. I’m actually really into poetry, and I was wondering if I could join your club.” Sayori: “That’s great! We’d love to have you join. Come on in, we were just finishing up our meeting.” Natsuki: “Yeah, we were just discussing each other’s poems. You can share yours too, if you want.” Yuri: “Absolutely. We’re always open to new perspectives and different styles of poetry. We strive to support and inspire each other in our writing.” (The student hesitates for a moment, then smiles.) Student: “Thank you. That sounds amazing. I’m excited to be a part of this club.” Monika: “Welcome! I’m Monika, the president of the club. What’s your name?” Student: “I’m Haruka. Nice to meet you all. I actually play a lot of mobile games at home, especially that free anime-style ARPG with 7 elements associated with different regions. My favorite element in that game has GOT to be the element of earth - or Geo, as the game calls it. The whole Chinese theme of its associated area, Liyue, really appeals to me. It’s so beautifully designed, and the characters are just incredible.” Natsuki: “Oh, THAT game! Yeah, I’ve heard of it! I mean, I’ve never really PLAYED it, but I know a lot of people who are obsessed with it. The artwork and character designs do look pretty cool, though.” Haruka: “Yeah, it’s definitely a visually stunning game. But anyway, back to poetry! I actually have a poem I’ve been working on that is DEDICATED to my favorite Geo character -","completion":"Ningguang. She's the epitome of elegance and grace, with her strategic mind and captivating presence. Here's a snippet: In the realm of Liyue, where mountains stand tall, A figure so regal, she commands them all. Ningguang, the Lady of Geo, poised with might, A brilliant mind, a vision, shining bright. Her palace of jade, a symbol of power, Reflecting her strength, hour after hour. With wisdom and grace, she rules with a firm hand, Guiding her people, united in her land. In her eyes, determination aflame, A leader who's unyielding, forever the same. In the depths of her gaze, secrets untold, A queen among stones, worth more than gold. As she stands before me, a figure of dreams, I'm enchanted by her, or so it seems. Her presence, her aura, it fills the air, Inspiring this poem, my heartfelt affair. Monika: \\"Wow, Haruka, that was absolutely stunning! I could feel the admiration and adoration you have for Ningguang. Your use of vivid imagery truly brought her character to life.\\" Sayori: \\"I love how you captured her strength and elegance. It's like I can picture her in my mind, standing tall and confident.\\" Yuri: \\"Your poem showcases the power and grace of Ningguang beautifully. The metaphors and descriptions allowed me to connect with her character on a deeper level.\\" MC: \\"I'm impressed, Haruka. Your passion for the game and the character really shines through in your poem. It's evident that you have a deep appreciation for the artistry and storytelling within the game.\\" Haruka: \\"Thank you all so much for your kind words. I'm really glad to have found a place where I can share my love for poetry and mobile games. I'm looking forward to being a part of this club and exploring different themes and styles with all of you.\\" Natsuki: \\"Well, we're happy to have you, Haruka. Your unique perspective and interests will definitely bring a fresh energy to our club. I can't wait to see what other amazing poems you'll share.\\" And with that, the literature club gained a new member, Haruka, whose love for poetry and mobile games added another layer of creativity and enthusiasm to their meetings. They continued to bond over their shared passions and support each other in their writing, creating a space where their individual voices could flourish together."},{"prompt":"pourquoi seul les cards de groupes enregistrent oldX et oldY et pour carte programmation avec les artistes la valeur est à null ?

La principale raison pour laquelle les valeurs \`oldX\` et \`oldY\` pourraient être enregistrées pour les cards de groupes mais non pour les cartes de programmation avec les artistes pourrait être due à la manière dont les transitions de pages sont gérées dans votre application. Ces valeurs sont souvent utilisées pour conserver les positions précédentes des éléments sur la page afin de créer des animations de transition fluides lors du routage d'une page à l'autre. Examinons quelques points clés dans votre code: 1. \`oldX\` et \`oldY\` sont récupérés de \`location.state\`. Cela signifie qu'ils sont passés avec le state de navigation lorsque vous passez d'une page à une autre avec \`react-router-dom\`. \`\`\`javascript const oldX = location.state?.oldX; const oldY = location.state?.oldY; \`\`\` 2. Pour les cartes des groupes, vous avez une condition qui vérifie si \`idArtistComingFrom\` est égal à \`groupe.idG\`. Si c'est le cas, \`oldX\` et \`oldY\` sont passés aux composants \`CarteProgrammation\`. \`\`\`javascript <CarteProgrammation // ... oldX={idArtistComingFrom == groupe.idG ? oldX : null} oldY={idArtistComingFrom == groupe.idG ? oldY : null} // ... /> \`\`\` 3. Pour les artistes, vous avez une condition similaire sur \`CarteProgrammation\`. Cependant, ce qui est important de noter ici, c'est comment \`idArtistComingFrom\` est défini et transmis. \`\`\`javascript <CarteProgrammation // ... oldX={idArtistComingFrom == artiste.idMG ? oldX : null} oldY={idArtistComingFrom == artiste.idMG ? oldY : null} // ... /> \`\`\` Si les cartes des artistes n'enregistrent pas \`oldX\` et \`oldY\`, cela pourrait être dû à l'une des raisons suivantes: - Les valeurs de \`idArtistComingFrom\` et de \`artiste.idMG\` ne correspondent jamais, ce qui signifie que la condition pour attribuer \`oldX\` et \`oldY\` aux valeurs de props de carte des artistes n'est jamais remplie. - L'état de navigation avec \`oldX\` et \`oldY\` n'est pas correctement transmis lorsque la navigation se produit de la page de l'artiste à la page de programmation. Pour résoudre ce problème, vous devez : - Vérifier que \`idArtistComingFrom\` est correctement défini lorsque vous naviguez vers la page de l'artiste. - Assurez-vous que la condition basée sur les identifiants de groupe et d'artiste fonctionne comme prévu. - Revoir le chemin de navigation et comment l'état est passé à s'assurer que \`oldX\` et \`oldY\` sont conservés lors des transitions nécessaires. La gestion des animations de transition d'un composant à un autre peut être complexe, et il est important que l'état de navigation soit cohérent et bien géré pour que les animations fonctionnent comme prévu."},{"prompt":"pourquoi idArtistComingFrom est à null pour les carteProgrammation utilisant artiste.idMG ??","completion":"L'identifiant \`idArtistComingFrom\` semble être défini à partir de l'état de navigation (\`location.state\`) lors de la transition vers la page de programmation : \`\`\`javascript const idArtistComingFrom = location.state?.comesFromPageArtist; \`\`\` Si \`idArtistComingFrom\` est \`null\` pour les \`CarteProgrammation\` qui utilisent \`artiste.idMG\`, c'est probablement parce que l'état de navigation n'a pas transmis cette information lorsque vous avez navigué vers cette page particulière. Voici quelques raisons possibles pour lesquelles cela pourrait arriver : 1. **L'état de navigation n'est pas défini :** Lorsque la transition vers la page de programmation est effectuée, il est possible que l'état de navigation ne soit pas correctement défini avec les valeurs appropriées (comme \`comesFromPageArtist\`). 2. **Mauvaise transmission des données lors du routage :** Si vous utilisez le composant \`Link\` de \`react-router-dom\` ou une autre méthode de routage, vous devrez vous assurer que vous transmettez explicitement la propriété \`comesFromPageArtist\` avec la bonne valeur en utilisant l'attribut \`state\`. Par exemple : \`\`\`javascript <Link to=\\"/programmation\\" state={{ comesFromPageArtist: artiste.idMG, ... }}> {/* contenu du lien */} </Link> \`\`\` 3. **Changement de la structure de l'état :** Si des modifications ont été apportées à la structure de l'état partagé entre les routes, il est possible que \`comesFromPageArtist\` ne soit pas présent ou ait été renommé, ce qui causerait une valeur \`undefined\` lorsqu'il est accédé. 4. **Problèmes de timing :** Il pourrait y avoir des cas où le composant n'est pas remonté ou l'état n'est pas mis à jour avant que vous essayiez de lire la valeur \`comesFromPageArtist\`, menant à une situation où la valeur serait lue comme \`null\`. Pour résoudre le problème, assurez-vous que chaque fois que vous naviguez vers une page de programmation depuis une page d'artiste : - Vous définissez l'état de navigation avec \`comesFromPageArtist\` en utilisant l'ID approprié. - Vous confirmez que l'état est correctement transmis à travers toutes les navigations. - Si le composant a accès à l'état de navigation (comme avec \`useLocation\`), vérifiez que cet état est accessible au moment où vous en avez besoin dans le cycle de vie du composant. Vérifiez également que le routage et l'état sont bien configurés et n'entrent pas en conflit avec d'autres logiques de l'application qui pourraient perturber l'état attendu."},{"prompt":"il s'avère que artiste.idMg me renvoie un null... import { useEffect, useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from \\"react\\"; import SearchBar from \\"../../components/form/SearchBar\\"; import Combo from \\"../../components/form/Combo\\"; import CarteArtiste from \\"../../components/Artiste/CarteProgrammation\\"; import { motion } from \\"framer-motion\\"; import { useLocation } from \\"react-router-dom\\"; import axios from \\"axios\\"; import Footer from \\"../../components/footer\\"; import CarteProgrammation from \\"../../components/Artiste/CarteProgrammation\\"; import { AnimatePresence } from \\"framer-motion\\"; type Props = { isNavInFocus: boolean; setIsNavTransparent: (isNavTransparent: boolean) => void; }; type Groupe = { idG: number; nomG: string; descriptionG: string; datePassage: string; heurePassage: string; }; type Artiste = { descriptionA?: string; idMG?: number; idG: number; nomDeSceneMG: string; nomMG: string; prenomMG?: string; datePassage?: string; heurePassage?: string; }; type Evenement = { dateDebutE: string; dateFinE: string; heureDebutE: string; heureFinE: string; idE: number; idG: number; idL: number | null; nomE: string; }; type Programme = Groupe | Evenement | Artiste; export default function Programmation(props: Props) { const location = useLocation(); const idArtistComingFrom = location.state?.comesFromPageArtist; const oldX = location.state?.oldX; const oldY = location.state?.oldY; const oldGroupes = location.state?.oldGroupes; const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(\\"\\"); window.history.replaceState({}, document.title); const [lesGroupes, setLesGroupes] = useState<Groupe[]>(location.state ?

Lorsque vous essayez de construire vos composants \`CarteProgrammation\` en utilisant \`artiste.idMG\` et qu'il est \`null\`, cela crée un problème de correspondance avec \`idArtistComingFrom\`. Il est essentiel de vérifier la source des données retournées par votre appel AJAX à l'aide d'axios. Voici quelques étapes pour résoudre ce problème : 1. **Vérifiez les Réponses du Serveur :** Vérifiez la réponse de votre appel API et voyez si \`idMG\` est vraiment \`null\` pour certains artistes. Vous pouvez ajouter un \`console.log(res.data)\` juste après que la réponse est retournée pour inspecter les données reçues. 2. **Traitement de Réponse :** Si \`idMG\` peut être \`null\`, vous devez envisager d'ajouter de la logique pour gérer ce cas de façon appropriée dans votre frontend. Par exemple, vous pourriez choisir de n'afficher que les cartes pour les artistes qui ont un \`idMG\` valide. 3. **Correction à l'Arrière-plan :** Si \`idMG\` ne devrait jamais être \`null\`, alors il y a un problème avec la manière dont les données sont générées ou transmises de votre backend. Double-vérifiez la logique de votre serveur pour vous assurer que les données d'identification de chaque artiste sont correctes et complètes. 4. **Typage :** Vous utilisez TypeScript, et votre type \`Artiste\` montre que \`idMG\` est optionnel (\`idMG?: number\`). Si cela est censé être toujours présent, il convient de rendre cette propriété non optionnelle dans le type (en excluant le point d'interrogation) pour refléter vos attentes en matière de données. 5. **Gérer les Cas Null:** Si parfois \`idMG\` est censé être \`null\` (par exemple, si un artiste est nouveau et n'a pas encore reçu d'identification dans le système), vous devrez gérer ce cas dans votre rendu de composants. En résumé, vous devez déterminer si \`idMG\` est intentionnellement \`null\` et, dans l'affirmative, gérer ce scénario dans votre code frontend. Sinon, vous devrez corriger le problème dans votre backend pour vous assurer que toutes les données d'artistes sont complètes et correctes avant de les envoyer au frontend."},{"prompt":"maintenant le problème c'est que lorsqu'on clique sur un artiste appartenant a un groupe et qu'on fait retour, toutes les cardes avec l'id de ce groupe font retour arrière aussi, il faut différencier la card avec quelque chose en plus que l'id groupe : import { useEffect, useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from \\"react\\"; import SearchBar from \\"../../components/form/SearchBar\\"; import Combo from \\"../../components/form/Combo\\"; import CarteArtiste from \\"../../components/Artiste/CarteProgrammation\\"; import { motion } from \\"framer-motion\\"; import { useLocation } from \\"react-router-dom\\"; import axios from \\"axios\\"; import Footer from \\"../../components/footer\\"; import CarteProgrammation from \\"../../components/Artiste/CarteProgrammation\\"; import { AnimatePresence } from \\"framer-motion\\"; type Props = { isNavInFocus: boolean; setIsNavTransparent: (isNavTransparent: boolean) => void; }; type Groupe = { idG: number; nomG: string; descriptionG: string; datePassage: string; heurePassage: string; }; type Artiste = { descriptionA?: string; idMG?: number; idG: number; nomDeSceneMG: string; nomMG: string; prenomMG?: string; datePassage?: string; heurePassage?: string; }; type Evenement = { dateDebutE: string; dateFinE: string; heureDebutE: string; heureFinE: string; idE: number; idG: number; idL: number | null; nomE: string; }; type Programme = Groupe | Evenement | Artiste; export default function Programmation(props: Props) { const location = useLocation(); const idArtistComingFrom = location.state?.comesFromPageArtist; const oldX = location.state?.oldX; const oldY = location.state?.oldY; const oldGroupes = location.state?.oldGroupes; const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(\\"\\"); window.history.replaceState({}, document.title); const [lesGroupes, setLesGroupes] = useState<Groupe[]>(location.state ?

Voici une suggestion de la façon de procéder : 1. **Création d'un identifiant unique pour chaque carte :** Vous pourriez concaténer l'identifiant du groupe avec l'identifiant de l'artiste pour former un identifiant unique qui sera utilisé comme clef (\`key\`) pour chaque \`CarteProgrammation\`. \`\`\`javascript <CarteProgrammation key={\`{artiste.idG}_{artiste.idMG}\`} // Unique key for each card id={artiste.idMG} //... other props /> \`\`\` 2. **Passage d'un identifiant d'artiste unique via l'état de navigation :** Lorsque vous naviguez vers la page de l'artiste, transmettez non seulement \`idG\` mais aussi \`idMG\` (si disponible), afin que vous puissiez distinguer les cartes individuelles à l'avenir. \`\`\`javascript <Link to={{ pathname: \\"/artiste\\", search: \`?id={artiste.idMG}\`, }} state={{ idG: artiste.idG, idMG: artiste.idMG, //... other state }} > {/* Contenu du lien */} </Link> \`\`\` Lorsque vous construisez maintenant vos cartes, utilisez ces informations uniques pour déterminer si vous mettez en place un retour arrière ou juste une transition normale. 3. **Modification de la logique de retour :** Dans votre gestionnaire de retour ou votre animation, utilisez ces identifiants uniques pour déterminer quelle carte doit revenir en arrière. \`\`\`javascript oldX={idArtistComingFrom?.idMG === artiste.idMG && idArtistComingFrom?.idG === artiste.idG ? oldX : null} oldY={idArtistComingFrom?.idMG === artiste.idMG && idArtistComingFrom?.idG === artiste.idG ? oldY : null} \`\`\` Dans ce fragment de code, \`idArtistComingFrom\` est supposé être un objet incluant \`idMG\` et \`idG\` pour que vous puissiez les comparer séparément.

Develop a detailed outline for chapters 11 (scene 11.2 and 11.3) through the Midpoint, progressing to chapter 23, the epilogue. Structure the outline using bullet points, ensuring each chapter includes 2-3 scenes narrated from the perspectives of Rhaenyra, Nyra, or Daemion (young Daemon). As Rhaenyra is protagonist, give more narrative time to her (main plotline). Your outline should reflect the following character developments and plot guidelines: 1. For chapters 11-13, depict Rhaenyra opting for the simplest and least effortful solutions to her challenges. This approach should culminate in a significant setback at the Midpoint, symbolized by the loss of a safe haven. 2. In chapters 13-20, intensify the stakes, pace, and Rhaenyra’s motivation. Highlight her growth from the repercussions of her earlier choices. 3. Post-Midpoint, illustrate Rhaenyra’s realization of her precarious predicament and her exploration of more unsavory or morally grey strategies to ensure her future survival, leading her to question her previous ethics. 4. Depict Nyra’s secret romantic subplot with Daemion, despite Criston, Rhaena and Baela’s hindering. After midpoint Rhaenyra realizes that magic ritual’s goal is to make Nyra and Daemion parents of Jace and Luke so Rhaenyra will low-key aid Nyra and Daemion’s romantic affair. Nyra will realize she is pregnant from Daemion after plot point 2. 5. The war hasn’t started it, the plot shows subtle attempts to eliminate rivals before king’s death. 6. Nyra and Daemion can’t leave the island due to the magical boundaries. All others, including Rhaenyra can but she is heavily pregnant and Daemon asked her to avoid leaving the castle for long. Rhaenyra doesn’t send her children far away, only to the nearest loyal vassals.

Ensure continuity from the pre-existing material and contribute to the story’s enhancement. Include detailed suggestions for plot twists, character evolution, and thematic depth to enrich the reader’s journey. Focus on clear event sequences, character dynamics, and climactic moments in the outline, and remember to: - Maintain narrative consistency - Highlight and illustrate plot turning points and character development - Emphasize thematic argument The aim is to craft a compelling extension of the story that aligns with the previous outline and adds depth to the characters and narrative. <backstory> <premise> On the verge of her king-father’s Viserys I passing, the crown princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (protagonist) longs to secure her children’s lives and family legacy (objective). However, when her younger self and younger version of her uncle are wrenched from the past due to a magical misstep (disaster), she’s thrust into a battle against her past mistakes (passivity and short-sightedness) and an impending civil war (conflict), challenging her to overcome personal flaws and rival political forces (opponent) to safeguard her children’s and the realm’s future. </premise> Genre: high fantasy plus family drama. <thematic argument> In order to survive and secure their family’s future in the game of thrones, one must actively engage and confront their rival factions. </thematic argument> <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. The timeline is changed, here it is the year 134 AC. iv. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. v. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. vi. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. vii. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand. viii. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. ix. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. x. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. xi. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xii. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just discuss the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xiii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiv. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xv. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or decisions in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvi. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> <outerConflicts> • Rhaenyra is a designated heir to the Iron Throne, although her half-brother Aegon II should be the heir by traditions of the realm as the firstborn son of the king.

It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. • Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement. • Rhaenyra is generally happy with Daemon, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. • Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. • Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. • During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. </outerConflicts> </outline> Prologue – The Omen: Scene 0.1 - Setting: Castle-bound ship at night - Characters: Prince Luke (POV), Crown Princess Rhaenyra, siblings of Luke - Events: Prince Lucerys “Luke” Velaryon, scorned for his divergence from the pure Valyrian features, embarks on a forbidden quest to alter his blood and appearance through ancient blood magic hidden within a stolen tome.

We were married for twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband Before his death, were both born again Christians. Since his death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 8,200,000.00 USD (Eight Million Two Hundred Thousand American Dollars) with the Bay Federal Credit Union Bank in California United States of America.

Изменение параметров \\"Масштабирование рабочего стола\\" через реестр применимо только к настройкам Windows, и не имеет непосредственной связи с настройками Nvidia Control Panel. Опции \\"Масштабирование через ГП или дисплей\\" и \\"Масштабирование рабочего стола\\" в Nvidia Control Panel управляются самой программой и не имеют соответствующих записей в реестре для изменения. Поэтому, чтобы изменить эти параметры в Nvidia Control Panel, рекомендуется выполнить следующие шаги: 1. Откройте Nvidia Control Panel на вашем компьютере. 2. Перейдите в раздел \\"Управление цветом на рабочем столе\\" или \\"Управление размером рабочего стола\\" (в зависимости от версии драйвера). 3. Внесите нужные изменения в опции \\"Масштабирование через ГП или дисплей\\" или \\"Масштабирование рабочего стола\\". 4. Сохраните изменения и закройте Nvidia Control Panel.
